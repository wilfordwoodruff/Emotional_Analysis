Cutler in the office and is working hard and doing well. Wilby is getting on beyond my expectation, and I am thank- ful to have him with me in the star office. Bro. Callister is with me and doing well Altogether we are getting on excellently.  I sail on Sat. 12th inst on ^S.S.^ Arizona with my family, whom I expect to see safe on the cars at N.

 We are sadly in need of elders, many will be released in the spring and there is only time to put new elders in possession of information necessary to make them efficient laborers in the ministry.  Having been trying to desire means to make the mission more efficient in Ireland. In two years and 8 mo. 15 to 20 brethren have labored earnestly among the protes- tant Irish, and bapised 8 persons. Three of them have apostatized, one is going overboard, two are new and untried and two, sisters are, we believe firm. The brethren have made many friends but none are bold enough to embrace the faith, and but little prospect of baptising males or females. Have advised the brethren to try the branching out to the south among the catholic population.  My wife & children are in fair health the thought of going home nerves them up.  I was so poorly in health that I wanted bath ^him^ ^Albert^ with me. I hope you will approve of my action.  Our Bank a/c is  190.0.0.  We all join in love. Love to the brethren.

 Agricultural College of Utah. SECRETARY'S OFFICE.  Logan, Utah, May 26th 1897.  Prest. Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City.  Dear President Woodruff:  I forward herewith a letter just received from Dr. Armenag Shil Hagopian of Aleppo, Syria, Turkey. Bro. Hagopian was here about two years ago, at which time I think you met him. He is now in charge of the branch at Aleppo.  Some months ago he sent me a letter descriptive of the hardships they were undergoing and he lamented very much because the Church had not assisted them to get out of Turkey. I wrote him explaining that the members there did not give any evidence that they would remain true should they come here, and called his attention to the fact that all other people in other lands who had joind the Faith would perhaps follow with the same request. But I told him to write me the condition of affairs there and I would forward it to you. It seems now that persecutions have ceased somewhat  that they are not so persistent. Several members left the Church because I was sent for to leave that land when the trouble was on and they were not sent for. 
 I left there in December of 1895.  I am of the opinion that permission could be had from the government for our faith to be freely taught there. I have a petition in asking for the Consulship at Beyrout and if I am successful I will try and open the way for the preaching of the Gospel in that land, if you see fit. That is, I will do all I can to obtain these permissions and the license to print or spread our literature.  I am your humble servant in the Gospel  E. W. Robinson 
 Big Cottonwood. Jan 8th 1897  President Wilford Woodruff and  Councillors.  Salt Lake City Utah.  Following is a letter adressed to me and  Brother Stouffer but as I think it well for you to see  for yourselves how our brethern feel and what is being  done in Turkey I have translated part of the letter for  your perusal and the larger part of the letter I  have condenced and given the main ideas.  It being possible that ^you^ might feel lead to write  an epistle to the saints in that land as there  are several items in this letters as well as  in Bro. Nigoghosian's letter that should be answered.  The letter reads as follows:  Messer F. F. Hintze and F Stauffer. Dear ^and beloved^ Brethern  in Christ. For two ^years^ until the present time I have with great desire expected  news or letter from you, but have received none wherefore I am very anxious.  I don t know, have we poor ones been entirely forgotten, or dont  your letters reach us? For this reason I have a great desire to write to  President Woodruff and also to our President in Liverpool, but  I cannot write English and if I write turkish I suppose they can- not read it. For this reason I can only be patient and wait, for such  information as God gives to help us in striving forward. For our  desire is very great to meet with you in Zion, if possible, &  there see you face to face: Oh, my dear brethren, dont we  ever come into your rememberance, how there was a little church  in Zara?, and dont you ever wonder what condition they are  in? aAre they alive or are they dead? Are they backsliding or are they  making headway, or what kind of exhortations do they, need? You 
 know the needs of this country very well. Because the wolves &  the tares are among us it ^is^ hard to live spiritually as we should and as we are among the weakest how much ^more^ need have we not  of listening to the voice of God and the advise of hHis Servants,  so that through ^your^ medium we ^may^ receive the word and revalations  of God and be a become blessed with spiritual blessings. For it is known  to you that although a plant is planted in the tops of the mountains  yet of the servants of hHim hwho plants attend to the plant &  nurish it with the rains from heaven it will grow better  and be more fruitful. We may have many teachers but you have  begotton us in the Gospel, and we desire your prayers and help for  the good of the little church here started so that by the help of  God and His grace we may be faithful to the end. Amen.  Dear Brethern I desire to communicate to you both  the spiritual and temporal condition of the church. We praise God  for His kindness to us in preserving us from destruction. For no  matter how many souls have been killed and how manyuch proper- ty has been destroyed, here in Zara we have been protected by the Gov- ernment and the city Fathers. But yet though we are all alive we  never feel safe. We feel we are but strangers in this land and often  with tears in our eyes we pray to God for his blessings deliverance  and that we may soon meet with you in Zion and behold that beau- tiful land and the temple of God and its blessings and the bles- sings of that land as you write to us.  Yea Lord come quickly and  save us from the sins of Babylon ^and bring^ us to that Holy City Amen.  Spiritually our little church is growing. We are now 18 members  6 males and 12 females. We meet every Sunday in fasting and  prayer and partake of the Lord s supper and exhort one another to  faithfulness. Besides this we meet every ^first^ Thursday in the month in 
 regular fast and privately other days and in this way the Lord  gives us pattience and grace to be faithful.  After this Brother to Nishan Sherinian writes of a Brother Nigoghos who started to come here and upon arriving in Constanti- nople and not obtaining means he made shipwreck of his  faith and turned to the Seventh-day Advents. Upon returning to Zara he introduced his new doctrine which was promptly rejected by  the church. As Bro. Nishan says: "he brought doctrines that we never  received from you". Bro. Nishan asks how to deal with him as he  still claims his preisthood and says he has only perfected his doctrine  or faith.  Please answer this. This man Nigoghorus was an Elder  and Bro. Nishan a preist. I have wrote to know his present authority.  Brother Nishan asks two questions: viz: About the Sabath day and  about the washing of feet. He says he will not alow these new feature  until he know^s^ whether or not they are excepted practices in Zion. He  holds close to the faith we delivered to him. Bro. Nishan further relates  a sad story of one of our sisters named Meriam Kizirin who was forci- ble taken by the authorities and married to an outsider, an Armenian, who  now prevents her from attending meetings. She had her own home and was  comfortable. This can be done in Turkey owing to their peculiar in- stitutions and yet we can have no redress because we are not  recognized as a church. He closes thus: "And now dear  Brethern we particularly ask you all to fast and pray for us  that we may in the near future ^may be freed^ from Babylon and that He  will deliver us from all danger and sin while we shall re- main here. May the grace of God be with us all. Amen.  Needing Your prayers I remain your Brother in Christ.  Nishan Shirinian, Zara, Sivus Vilayet, Turkey.  I will only add that whatever may be said of the  Armenian race we beleive there are many good people therr and that  Brother Stauffer and I can faithfully testify that Bro. Nishan Sherinian  is a true saint and a worthy representative of our cause in that far  off land. He believed when I testified to him and at once excepted the truth  He has performed a good mission in company with Elder Stauffer to Merrivan.  I am as always your humble Servant.  F. F. Hintze.

 OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints.  P.O. Box B.  Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 7, 1897.  Beloved Brethren and Sisters in Turkey:  We have lately received a number of letters from various brethren addressed to Bro. Lefvon S. Abraham. In these letters a number of questions are sprung concerning your condition and also asking about a future opportunity of gathering to some place in your own land.  First, we learn that the different branches of the Church in Turkey need a fuller organization, this has been ordered to be corrected through the office in Liverpool and Elder Armenag S. Hagobian. President Hago- bian should make a wvisit to the different branches of the church and ordain a few worthy brethren to the office of elders and some to the lower priesthood so that there may be workers in each branch to supply the necessary spiritual food and to preach the Gospel with authority to those not acqiuainted with our doctrines. There are also some difficul- ties that should be straightened out so that all might work as one in Jesus Christ our Lord.  It is probable that before long some elders will be sent there again to labor, and we hope you will receive them as the servants of the living God sent to you to minister in the ordinances of life and salvation for your good and for the good of the nations in that far off part of the world. For the Gospel of Christ must be preached in all places according to the will of the Father before the end will come. Dear Brethren and Sisters, you are inclined to be impatient, as though you alone had troubles to endure. This you should not be. The saints have troubles in 
 all the world, some more, some less, but all have to exercise patience and by so doing show their devotion to God and His cause, and their works will in tijme shine forth out of the darkness that surrounds the world. God will be glorified through our labors and our love of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. Satan is pressing the saints everywhere possible. He knows his time is short and he loses no opportunity to oppress the saints and if possible to overcome. This we know he cannot, but he will try, and we must resist evil and do good, labor faithfully and diligently and never tire, and although we cannot do as we like, let us not forget that this work is of God. He guides and he will in- spire his servants to mogve at the right time and in the right place. Wherefore, let us love, respect and pray for His servants that they may have the Holy Spirit to guide them and that the saints may have the Com- forter to help them to understand their counsels and to carry them out. This work is great. We mean the work of redemption, and the laborers are few in comparison to the greatness of the work. Calls for elders and Gospel knowledge are extensive and where the nations seem ripe to havrvest many are sent and many precious souls are redeemed from the false doc- trines and traditions of the world and as soon as the way seems clear the work in Turkey will be pushed forward. For, to the land of Palestine are made great promises, and if you remain faithful you will be instrumental by your prayers, faith and works to help fulfil many fof the glorious promises. Teach your children as best you can the Gospel of Christ, so that when they are eight years old they can be baptized and confirmed members of Hic Church, for so has God commanded us in these days. And until you can be gathered to one place where you can have the home rule, the laws and privileges of the country affords, let your children attend the Protestant schools and learn to read and write and do the best you can for them, and God will give the children sufficient of His Spirit to discern good from evil. Let dfather and mother teach and exhort them 
 at home about the Gospel, and the Protestants will have no power over the children to lead them astray. God has much good among all nations and this he will consecrate for the upbuilding of His kingdom. We are all His children and He has joy in good works and in the progress of His children and the saints above all should be fully tolerant and observant, and kind and good, always speaking the truth, do right, and above all, be virtuous in thought and deed.  Of the young sisters of whom you write, we would say it is best not to give them in marriage to any bust saints, if possible. Let them rather wait the time of the Lord. Good men will be found in time. It is not good for saints and sinners to be bound together. Be patient in well-doing. These questions about the children and young sisters are the same as we find among the saints in all lands where they are scatt- ered, and they have to abide the Lord's time until they can be changed in the proper way. We do not build school-houses nor support schools only where the saints locally are able to do so; it is not in the line of our work, but we sustain the laws and institutions of the country where we go, and find that good results follow, for so the Lord has revealed to us.  We hope and pray to God that a way may be opened, that a gathering place for our people may be found somewhere in the promised land. For as we are of Israel we feel the promises are unto us and we look forward to the day when God will move upon the rulers in Turkey to set apart a place for us to live, and there acknowledge us as a people and give us liberal government and such privileges as insure peace and prosperity to us and the nation. Do not despair, Latter-day Saints, were you in countries ruled by some of the Christian potentates, you would not have as much liberty as you now have, neither could our hopes be so bright for the future. For priestcraft and sin and misrule are very great in many nations, so much so that we cannot preach the Gospel there at all. 
 Be sure we will do all we can for you, you are of us; we are all one body in Christ; we have one Lord; we all drink at the same fountain; we are all looking for redemption through the only name given under heaven whence comes salvation. Now that our faith is one and our hope the same, let us seek to be filled with the love of God. Let us always seek profitable conversations, leaving mysteries alone. Read the scriptures dfor they are profitable to us for instruction. And more particularly let us seek for the possession of the Spirit ogf God to be our guide and to increase our testimonies. Do not discuss the time of the coming of Christ in an unprofitable manner. There is a time appointed, and God only knows it. He has not revealed it. But the appointed time will surely come long before most people are prepared. This we know, it is not far distant, for the signs of his coming are now very plain. But there is yet much to do to prepare for his coming that great event. Many of the honest have not yet heard of His great Latter-day work. Zion must be fully established. Jerusalem must be rebuilt by the Jews, the ten tribes must return from the north, the American Indians, who are of the house of Israel must be converted and become workers in His cause. And many more of the different branches of the House of Israel must return to the promised lands and be prepared to meet Him and to receive Him. FRoor He will be their King when He comes. God's words must all be fulfilled and we must wait patiently and labor in the fear of God that we may be with His holy company when He comes. For hHe Wwill come in the clouds and save His saints while His angels will reap the earth and cleanse it fr from sin.  Brother Levon Abraham, who is here, is a faithful and humble member of the church. He has a great desire to do good. His whole soul is laboring to do you good, and when he has learned the English language he will return to you and be instrumental in doing much good, if he remains faithful. He has given us much comfort concerning the saints in Turkey and his labors here in Zion in your behalf will be of great benefit to you in time to come.

In regard to Elder W B Dougall Jr, President B Young who will have reached You ere this, will give You all information in connection with Him, Wilby is still with His Uncle John W Young at 22 Portland Place, ^London^.  We received a letter from Him last night, in which He says Am getting better everyday and beginning to feel like myself once more,  He said in His Letter that S M Barrett is quite sick , Your instructions, in relation to Wilbys future developments will be adhered to Elder Thos E Taylor is here with us at 42, one number of the Star has been issued since Wilby left for London and this Weeks number is all ready for the Press, Brother Taylor thinks with the help of the Brethren He will get along.  You said in Your last letter to President Young You had not been advised as to how many Elders would be needed for the Scandinavian Mission I wrote to President Christiansen, receiving His answer yesterday, in which He said the number needed, would be Twelve Sweeds, Ten Danes, and Eight Norweigens, He said He had forwarded some names to this office 
 early in January of Elders in Utah whom He thought would make good Missionaries, which I have looked for, but failed to find. He said in His Letter the Financial Condition of the Mission is very poor, saying their office held Notes of several Parties in Utah and other places, asking the question what He should do in the matter,  I thought of writing for Him to send to Your Office, the full particulars of the Matter, and You would advise Him We have several applications coming in from different parties, asking the Rates to points in Colorado and Arizona, if Our Agents in Utah could answer this question by stating something near the amount, it would confer a favor. Last Sunday I visited the NewCastle Conference, the Meetings being held at Stockton on Tues, the Brethren said they had sparead around three thousand hand bills, advertising the Conference, some few strangers were  present who had come on the invitation of their friends, not one had come, as the Brethren thought & ^through^ their advertising. I spent nine months last Winter and Spring in this Conference being there during the great Strike of the Coal Miners, which affected most of the Iron and Steel works in that region also the Shipbuilding, Stockton itself have six iron, and two steel plants, each plant employing a thousand men once upwards today the two steel plants are working, while the six iron plants are all idle, there being no demand for iron, out of eleven of our Brethren living in Stockton only one is in Work, the President of the Conference, said they would have to give up renting their Hall, as Himself, and Elders have had to pray most of the expenses, of that and the Conference House, one of the members of the Branch is now in the Hospital with the Small Pox it seems almost impossible for young Men to get work in this country, it looks like a preconcerted plan, among the employers, not to employ them, which enforces them to enlist in the Army, they are taken to India, Egypt, and other places where it is said a large percentage of them die off not being acclimated I saw quite a number of young Soldiers parting with their mothers, Sisters, and friends while in the Manchester Stateion on Tuesday last  I expect the Saints are looking at Home are looking forward to a Glorious time at the Dedication of the Temple. We all feel interested, Praying when the time shall come that the Holy Ghost may be poured out in great abundance and that you may have the Communision of Holy Angels in the Glorious Work.  With Kindest Regards I Remain  Your Brother Alfred Solomon

The Brethern for Scandinavia leave in the morning. I wrote a few weeks ago in regard to what rules are observed in Releasing Presidents of the Mission on the Continent. President Farrell and Elder Wm Hyde of the Netherland Mission left their Homes some time in Feb 1891 and have been hinting to us in regard to their Release. We expect a small company to Emigrate from tha mission, not hearing from you in regard to this matter, I have taken the liberty to ask President Farrell to name some one to take His place, that Himself and Elder Hyde can be relesed to accompany there Saints Home. I have been in receipt of  Letters from President Fred Clawson, of the London Conference, speaking of Elder E. J. Farnes now laboring in that Conference, of His financial condition being very low, I learned while in London about two months ago He had given His note for four pounds borrowed money,  He receives no assistance from Home, and has been borrowing ever since. The Elders there feel they learn all they can stand up to, and cannot help him any more, Elder Farnes is 56 years old, and can do very little walking, one of His feet troubles Him very much 
 President Clawson says, He is not a man of sound judgement, and very little wisdom in discharging His duties. I have sent Him His Release to Sail on the Arizona May 6th Elder Grant Y Bullock of the Birmingham Conference has received a Letter from His Bishop, that His mother lies in a critical condition, as regards Her Health, with no hopes of recovery  Elder Bullock left His Home in the latter part of June 1891. I have Released Him to sail May 6th.  President Christiansen of the Scandinavian ^mission^ is desirous of returning Hom, having left His Home in April 1891 He has recommended Elder C A Carlquist to succeed Him. I have sent Elder Carlquist a Letter of Appointment, to that effect Elder Christiansen will leave for Home sometime in May or June.  I was in Manchester last Sunday week with President Albert C Young, of that Conference it being the day set apart for our Fasting and Prayer in the British Mission, in reading an extract from a Letter written by President Woodruff dated July 8th 1840, when three or  four of the Twelve were present at the Manchester Conference in speaking of the numbers in the different Quorums of the Priesthood and also of the Saints, present, and the numbers attending the meetings, I couldnt help butcontrast compare it with the number of to- day, Albert C told me in their meeting their now four Saints was their usual number beside the Elders, Albert C, and myself look the 9 A.

The Spirit of God was manifest to a great extent, the Saints felt to rejoice in having the privelege with the Saints in Zion, to meet in a Spirit of Humility and Prayer, a feeling of good Will, and Peace, pervaded the Hearts of the Saints, a vote was taken, to forgive, and make right; all differences that might exist, in the Hearts of any of the Saints, against each other, during the meeting Seven Persons were Confirmed, out of ten who had been Baptized during the week, all being young persons between the ages of 16 and 27, most of them bearing their Testimony with the others of the Blessing of the Almighty in their behalf by reports I have been receiving from the Presidents in Great Britain and the Continent it was a time of general rejoicing, Zion and Her People are being as a City set upon a Hill, the news of the dedica- tion of the Great Temple is being spread through the Land, the Papers of the World having taken the matter up to a great extent, I hope the Spirit of Love and Good Will that now exists, will continue with the Saints, for evermore.

 before I get through, to the rising generation of Israel. My remarks may be very eccentric to any but Latter- day Saints, and to them also, I expect.  I suppose when I was born the devil knew what I should be called to do; for there has been from the day I was born until the present two powers with me one to kill me, the other to save me. I stand before you today a pretty sound-looking, for a man ninety-one years of age. I stand before you with a body in which almost every bone has been broken except my back and neck. I have had through my life a power af- ter me to take my life. When I was about three years old I was pushed into a caldron of boiling water, which had just been taken off the fire. My grandmother took me out, and my skin all dropped off excepting off my head and feet. I was wrapped up for months in cotton and oil. That was the beginning of my troubles. When I was twelve years of age I was drowned; at any rate, I lay in thirty feet of water long enough to drown anyone. After several unsuccessful attempts, I was brought up out of the water. This was under the Farming- ton mill dam. I was just as dead as I shall be thirty years hence. I lay on my back and saw the sun go out, and passed through all the sensations of  death that any man would in drown- ing. After an hour's labor, I was brought around to life again. I shall not go into the particulars of many of these things, but I have passed [throug]h what may be termed death a number of times in my life. When I was 15 years old I was in one of those Connecticut blizzards. I walked four miles through a wood into the open country, and I sought some place where I could hide from the storm and rest. There was but one house within a mile of me that was the poor house, which was about twenty- five rods away. The man was moved upon to go up in his garret to get some pennyroyal to give to a sick woman, and he felt led to look out of the win- dow. He saw me crawling into the  hollow of a big tree. He knew what the result of that would be better than I did. He took his horse and sleigh and came to me, and when he got there I was asleep, and he preserved my life. When I was 14 years old I was bit by a mad dog, and ought to have died; but I did not. So I contin- ued on, until I can say that I have broken both of my legs, one twice; broken both of my arms, breast bone, several ribs, and altogether been through a pretty hard experlence for a man who had to be called to preach the Gospel, at least. I was a miller by trade. I have been in two water wheels under full head of water, and I suppose I ought to have been killed in either of them, but I was not hurt.  That preserving power has followed  me all the way through my life. It has been with me upon my missions abroad as well as at home. It has followed me until the present day, and I have been placed in a great many strange places.  I was ordained to dedicate this Salt Lake Temple fifty years before it was dedicated. I knew I should live to dedicate that Temple. I did live to do it. I had a great desire in my boyhood to receive the Gospel of Christ, to see a prophet or somebody that could teach me the Gospel of Christ as taught by the ancient Apostles and as I read of in the New Testament. I  desired this with every sentiment of my heart, and on the first Gospel sermon I ever heard I was baptized, with my oldest brother. I immediate- ly went to Kirtland. I was in Zion's Camp with the Prophet of God. I saw the dealings of God with him. I saw the power of God with him. I saw that he was a Prophet. What was mani- fest to him by the power of God upon that mission was of great value to me and to all who received his instruc- tions. I will refer to one instance. A short time before we landed in Missouri Joseph called the camp to- gether. He there prophesied unto us,  and told us what lay before us. He gave us the reason why chastisement was before us. He says: "You con- sider me a boy with the rest of you. You have not realized my position be- fore the Lord. But there is a chas- tisement before this camp." He told us that this would come upon us because he had not been obeyed in his counsels. In one hour after we landed in Mis- souri and pitched our tents at Mr.  Burkett's, one man began to fall here, 
 another there, and in a few moments we had a dozen of our camp stretched  upon blankets with cholera. The Prophet of God, when he saw this, felt to sympathize with them, and he and Hyrum laid their hands upon Brother Carter, the first man that was taken sick, but as soon as they did it they were seized themselves, and they both had to leave the camp. He said afterwards: "I told you what was coming to pass, and when afflic- tion came I stretched out my hand to stay it, and I came very near falling by it myself." That mission was very interesting to me.  I want to say here that in all my life since joining this Church and kingdom, notwithstanding these pow- ers that have been with me to kill me, I have always had the revelations of God with me. That is something I want to talk about to Israel before I get through. The power of God has told me what to do and what not to do. While the devil has had power to afflict my body very seriously, there has been a power with me that has saved me through it all. And, when- ever I have had the Holy Spirit with me to tell me what to do, I have had to do that. By that I have been saved. By listening to that still small voice I am here today with you. There are two reasons why I am there today. When I went back after the pioneer journey, President Young said he wanted me to take my family and go to Boston, and stay there till I could gather all the Saints of God in New England and Canada and bring them to Zion. That was the mission he gave me on my return from the pio- neer journey to Winter Quarters. I went in the spring, as he told me, and took my family. We came one even- ing to one of the brethren's houses in Indiana. Several of us were there. Orson Hyde had a team as well as my- self. We drove into a long yard. I set my carriage within six inches of his. I had my wife and children with me. I tied my animals to an oak tree on the other side of where we camped. I went to bed in my carriage. As I laid down, the Spirit of the Lord told me to get up and move my carriage. I did not ask the Lord what He meant. I did as I was told. The same Spirit told me to go and move my animals away from that tree. I did that. My wife asked me why I did it. I told her I did not know. I had not been in bed twenty minutes when there came a whirlwind and took that oak tree, which had stood there per- haps fifty years, split it right through the trunk, and it swept through both of those fences where my carriage had stood. It never touched Brother Hyde's carriage, but it would have crushed me and my family to the earth if I had not listened to the voice of the Spirit. After spending two years and a half in New England and Canada, getting the Saints out, I started back  with the last lot, about a hundred, from Boston. We landed in Pitts- burg at dusk. We were anxious not to stay there, but to go on to St. Louis. I saw a steamer making steam ready to go out. I went to the cap- tain and asked him how many passen- gers he had. "Three hundred and fif- ty." "Could you take another hun- dred?" "Yes." I was just about to  tell him we wanted to go aboard when that Spirit said to me, "Don't go aboard that steamer, you nor your company." All right, said I. I had  learned something about that still, small voice. I did not go aboard that  steamer, but waited till the next morn- ing. In thirty minutes after that  steamer left, it took fire. It had ropes  instead of wheel chains, and they could not go ashore. It was a dark night, and not a soul was saved. If I had not obeyed the influence of that moni- tor within me, I would have been there  myself, with the rest of the company. The Thirteenth ward would not have had an Atwood for a Bishop; the Church would not have had a Leonard W. Hardy as Bishop. They were both with me, and their families, including Brother Samuel Hardy, who is in St. George now, upwards of ninety years old. I never disobeyed that Spirit but once in my life; I did it then through the urgency of other persons, and it nearly cost me my life. I have been acquainted with this Spirit. It was not the blow of trumpets nor thunder and lightning; it was the still small voice to me. All the way from my boyhood I have been governed and controlled by that Spirit. My missions 
 have been by that Spirit of revelation. I was told to go to Fox Islands by that same still small voice. In the time of the great apostasy in Kirtland the Spirit of the Lord said to me, "Get you a partner and go to Fox Islands." I knew no more what was in Fox Islands than what was in Kolob. I went there, however, baptized a hun- dred and brought them up to Zion with me. It was upon that island where I received a letter from Joseph Smith, telling me that I was called by revela- tion to fill the place of one of the Twelve who had fallen. You will see it in the Doctrine and Covenants. That thing was revealed to me before I re- ceived the letter from Joseph Smith, but I did not feel disposed to tell it to any mortal man, for I knew it was my duty to keep such things to myself. Through all my life and labors, when- ever I have been told to do anything by the Spirit of the Lord, I have always found it good to do it. I have been preserved by that power. That power  was with me when I went to Hereford- shire. I was preaching every night  with Brother Cordon, and one night we held a meeting in the town hall at Hanley, in Staffordshire. The Spirit  that still small voice said to me, "This is the last meeting you will hold with this people for many days." I told the congregation so when I got up. They were very much astonished, and asked me where I was going. I told them I did not know. After, I went to ask the  Lord what he wanted of me, and He told me to go to the south. That was all the answer I got. I took the stage and rode eighty miles south. The first man's house I went into was John Ben- bow's. I had not been in his house fifteen minutes till I understood why the Lord had sent me there. There was a people broken off from the Wes- leyan Methodists, who had banded together and called themselves United Brethren. They were watching for the coming of the Son of Man, watching for the Gospel of Christ, as they read of it in the New Testament. The first  thirty days after I got there I brought into the Church some two thousand, with fifty ministers, and all their chapels, licensed according to law, were in my hands. There was no blowing of trumpets about that. The Spirit of the Lord told me to go there, and when I got there I saw why I was sent.  That is, perhaps, enough to say about those things. Now, I  want to say to this congregation, to the young men of Israel, to the Elders of Israel, to all our missionaries, the day has come when the God of heaven requires at my hands, as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to say unto you, it is the will of God for you to take this course. Get the Spirit of God before you go on your missions or anywhere else. Get the spirit of revelation with  you. And when you get that you are safe, and you will do exactly what the Lord wants you to do. I have felt strongly impressed to say that to this Conference. What can you do with- out revelation? We cannot do the will of God and accomplish what is re- quired of us without it. We will make no mistakes if we pursue that course. That spirit is with the Apostles, and with the Elders of Israel who are true and faithful. The rising generation should labor to obtain the Spirit of  God. Get it within you and it will be a continual monitor with you.  That is one reason, brethren and sis- ters, why my life has been preserved. I will tell you another reason. Of course, this is my own reason for it. One reason why I am here is because the Lord has chosen the weak things of this world to preach the Gospel, to do His work, to build up His kingdom. I do not think He has ever had a  weaker instrument on earth to work through than myself. The Almighty has known that never for a minute since I have been a member of this Church have I had any power to take any honor or glory to myself with re- gard to anything that I have been en- abled to do in the work of the ministry or elsewhere. Why? Because I have known it has come from God, and not from me. And no other man who has engaged in this work has had any pow- er of himself. This power has come from God unto us, whereby we have been enabled to do the work He has re- quired at our hands.  There is a change coming over the earth; there is a change coming over the Christian world; and it is at our door. You read the revelations in the Bible, in the Book of Mormon and in the Doctrine and Cove- nants appertaining to our day and the 
 generation before the coming of the Son of Man. War! Yes; war is one of the troubles that belong to the generation in whlch we live. It will come to pass, and no power beneath the heavens can stay it. Who cannot open their eyes and see the change in the things around  us? Read these revelations the revela- tion just read by Brother Cannon, and the others in these books. The God of heaven has set His hand to carry out these great purposes that you read of. They are as sure to come to pass as that God lives. There is no power on earth, nor beneath the earth, nor any- where else, that can stay the fulfill- ment of these things. And they are at our doors.  I am anxious that the Latter-day Saints shall round up their shoulders and bear off the kingdom of God. Many in the world have labored to try the overthrow [of] Mormonism. They have driven our people from their lands. They have persecuted and afflicted us. They have put some to death, for the word of God and testimony of Jesus. But they have not thwarted the pur- poses of God in any of these things. The Lord, in His mercy and wisdom, has led this people to these valleys of the mountains. It is ordained of God that Zion is to be established here. Here is the Tabernacle that the Prophet spoke of as a covering from the storm and the wind, etc. These temples are here in fulfillment of prophecy. We have four of them in this State. President Young was honored of God in the establishment of these things. He lived long enough to dedi- cate the corner stone of this Temple on this block, into which the Latter-day Saints go and deliver their friends who are in the prison house, and attend to the ordinances of the house of God for them, in fulfillment of the ancient Prophets, who spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost, to the effect that saviors should be raised up on Mount Zion in the latter days while the kingdom is the Lord's. Zion has got to arise.  "Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains; for the Lord hath com- forted His people, and will have mercy upon His afflicted.  "But Zion said, The Lord hath for- saken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.  "Can a woman forget her suckling child, that she should not have com- passion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.  "Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are con- tinually before me." (##Isaiah 49:13-16|Isaiah, 49:13-16##.)  All that has been spoken concerning Zion will come to pass, and you and I today are witnesses of these things.  We are here for salvation and eter- nal life. We are here to obtain those great blessings which Saints of God in every age of the world have obtained when they have obeyed the command- ments of God. Shall we fail? No, we  shall not if we do our duty. The Gospel is just as good today as it was in the days of the Savior. As to the glor- ious blessings of the Gospel of Christ,  they have been unpopular in almost every age of the world. Take Christ Himself: where was there a more un- popular man than the Savior of the world in His day? And His Apostles were unpopular. They were put to death for the word of God and testi- mony of Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, Christ was the Son of God; and the Saducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, and all the sects that warred against Him were cursed and many of them were cast down to hell, while He re- mains as the Savior of the world, and received the honor and the glory which His Father had ordained for Him. I want our young people especially to remem- ber these things. Those who are going upon missions must not neglect them. Unless you have the Holy Ghost with you when you go out to preach the Gospel, you cannot do your duty; but when you have that you are safe, go where you will, and your words will have their effect in the hearts of the honest and meek of the earth.  Brethren and sisters, I feel to thank God that we are as well off as we are. I feet [feel] to thank God that we are in the position we occupy in these valleys of the mountains. Here is a safe place. While in the dedication of that Temple I saw the judgments of God that were about to be poured out upon this gen- 
 have been given. Joseph Smith was full of revelation. He foresaw this people, and this work until it was wound up.  My prayer to God is that we may pursue such a course that we may en- joy and receive all these blessings, and our posterity after us. Amen. 
 eration. They will come to pass. I read the other night of a terrible flood. Who ever heard of such a flood in America before? These floods, and troubles and tribulations are increasing in the earth, and they will increase un- til this scene is wound up. I pray God my Heavenly Father to bless you all,  to inspire our hearts, that the vision of our minds may be open to compre- hend the position we are in and the re- sponsibility we are under. The eyes of all heaven and earth and hell are over us. The eyes of the devils are over us. They labor for our destruction; but they have not power to do it. We are in the hands of God. He holds the keys of the destinies of the inhabitants of the earth, and He will bless the righteous, no matter who they are nor where they are. I am thankful to listen to the teachings that I have heard at this Conference from the El- ders of Israel. I rejoice in the progress that has been made during the past  year in the Church abroad. There has been an addition to the Church that we have never met with in any other year since the organization of this Church. And here at home there has been a great addition. Our sisters have labored faithfully in the Primary Associations, in the Mutual Improvement associations, and in every capacity in which they  are called to labor. The blessings of God are with them, and they are doing much good. The Sunday schools have also added to their numbers. They have now over one hundred thousand members. The Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations, as has been  said, have an addition of about thirteen thousand as a result of their labors the past year. God is blessing those who labor among them. If you can save a soul from death, what bless- ings you will have with that soul. As the Lord said to Oliver Cowdery, "If it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father." We should continue in this labor, that we may gain the salvation of the souls of men. Inasmuch as you will do this, the blessings of God will  attend you. Zion has got to arise or  fall. Which shall it be? The proclamation of the Gospel of Christ is in favor of Zion. All the revelations appertaining to this day are in favor of Zion, and of preparing the way for the coming of the Son of Man. And Zion will arise and shine.  God bless you, one and all. Let us do our duty and seek to magnify our religion, that when we get through we will rejoice in that. It is better to be on the Lord's side than anywhere else. I want salvation. I want to meet my forefathers and my friends whom I have labored here to redeem, who never heard the Gospel in their day and generation. God has given us this privilege. We have Elders of Israel laboring in all these temples day by day for the salvation of the children of men. We have been blessed in this labor, and we will continue to be  blessed; and when we get on the other side of the veil there is not one of us but will rejoice for the good we have done. May God bless you. I feel to bless the Latter-day Saints, as far as I have power to bless. Our daughters and our mothers are laboring for the  salvation of Israel in their line, and so are the Elders of Israel in their line. But we want to increase and continue to increase, until we have power in  the earth to gather up all the honest and meek of the earth. God bless,  guide and direct us all in the path of  truth and righteousness, for Jesus' sake. Amen.  At the conclusion of his remarks the vast congregation arose en masse and in unison with the choir, sang: We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, To guide us in these latter days. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  Historical incidents Keys of power from Joseph to the Twelve Founders of our nation inspired  Afflictions awaiting the world Importance of re- deeming the dead.  At the close of this Conference I have a desire to bear my testimony before you upon a few principles.  I have rejoiced very much during this Conference in listening to the testi- mony of the Apostles and Elders who have spoken.  It has brought to my rememberance a little of my history. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  In April, 1838, while in the town of Kirtland, in walking across the street I met two men who held the Apostle- ship.  They said to me, "Brother Woodruff, we have something that we want you to join us in."  Said I, "What is it?"  "We want another Prophet to lead us."  "Whom do you want?" "We want Oliver Cowdery.  Joseph Smith has apostatized."  After listen- ing to them, I said to them:  "Unless you repent of your sins you will be damned and go to hell, and you will go through the fulness of eternal damnation, and all your hopes in this life will pass before you like the frost before the rising sun.  You are false. Joseph Smith has not apostatized. He holds the keys of the kingdom of God on earth, and will hold them until the coming of the Son of Man, whether in this world or in the world to come." I am happy to say that those men did repent pretty soon, turned to the Church, and died in it.  I feel thankful today that Joseph F. Smith is with us as a son of Hyrum Smith.  He bears a true and faithful testimony of his father.  I would to God that Joseph Smith had a son in the flesh who would do as Joseph F. Smith does here bear testimony to the truth of his father.  The Prophet Joseph Smith has no son that stands in the midst of the Church of God and bears record of his father.  He never has had; possibly never will have.  I will give you a testimony here that will show you where I stand with re- gard to this matter.  Joseph Smith never ordained his son Joseph, never blessed him, never set him apart, to lead this Church and kingdom on the face of the earth.  When he or any other man says he did, they state that which is false before high heaven.  The last speech that Joseph Smith ever made to the quorum of the Apos- tles was in a building in Nauvoo, and it was such a speech as I never heard from mortal man before or since.  He was clothed upon with the Spirit and power of God.  His face was clear as amber.  The room was filled as with consuming fire.  He stood three hours upon his feet.  Said he:  "You Apostles of the Lamb of God have been chosen to carry out the purposes of the Lord on the earth.  Now, I have received, as the Prophet, seer and revelator, standing at the head of this  dispensation, every key, every or- dinance, every principle and every Priesthood that belongs to the last dispensation and fulness of times.  And I have sealed all these things upon your heads.  Now, you Apostles, if you do not rise up and bear off this kingdom, as I have given it to you, you will be damned."  I am the only witness left on earth that can bear record of this, and I am thankful that I have lived to see the day in which I stand.  I am thank- ful to see the sons of these Prophets and Apostles holding the Holy Priest- hood in our day and generation.  I do not believe the day will ever come  it is too late in the day, in my opinion  when any Elder in this Church will be called to stand before any two of the Apostles with us today and give unto them the declaration that I gave unto the two Apostles I have referred to.  I do not think any of the Apostles will occupy that position.  I have faith to believe that these men who bear the Apostleship will hold it and live their religion.  They have been called and ordained of God for this purpose. I do not think that one of them will apostatize.  I believe they will be with you and with this Church while they stand in the flesh, true and faithful to God.  Brother Cannon has been laying be- fore you something with regard to the nation in which we live and what has been said concerning it.  I am going to bear my testimony to this assembly, if I never do it again in my life, that those men who laid the foundation of this American government and signed the Declaration of Independence were the best spirits the God of heaven could find on the face of the earth. They were choice spirits, not wicked men.  General Washington and all the men that labored for the purpose were inspired of the Lord.  Another thing I am going to say here, because I have a right to say it. Every one of those men that signed the Declaration of Independence, with General Washington, called upon me, as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the Temple at St. George, two con- secutive nights, and demanded at my hands that I should go forth and at- tend to the ordinances of the House of 
 GENERAL CONFERENCE.  God for them.  Men are here, I believe, that know of this, Brothers J. D. T. McAllister, David H. Cannon and James G. Bleak.  Brother McAllister baptized me for all those men, and then I told those brethren that it was their duty to go into the Temple and labor until they had got endowments for all of them.  They did it.  Would those spirits have called upon me, as an Elder in Israel, to perform that work if they had not been noble spirits before God?  They would not.  I bear this testimony, because it is true.  The Spirit of God bore record to myself and the brethren while we were laboring in that way.  What has been said with regard to this nation and to our position is com- ing to pass.  All the powers of earth and hell will not stay the hand of Almighty God in the fulfillment of those great prophecies that have to come to pass to prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man. You who have gathered here are my witnesses of this.  I feel as though the day has come when every Elder and every Latter-day Saint ought to stop and consider the position he is in and the covenants he has entered into.  Is there anything on the face of the earth that will pay you to depart from the oracles of God and from the Gospel of  Christ?  Is there anything that will pay you to lose the principles of sal- vation, to lose a part in the first resur- rection with the privilege of standing in the morning of the resurrection clothed with glory, immortality and eternal life at the head of your father's house?  No, there is nothing.  I feel sorry many times when I see men who have the Priesthood forget almost that they have any in- terest in the work of God.  I feel to thank God that I have lived as long as I have, and to see as much as I have in fulfillment of the words of the Prophet of God.  His days were few.  The lives of great men have been strange.  The idea of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, only laboring three years and a half in the ministry and then He was put to death!  His Apostles, too, were put to death, ex- cepting John the Revelator, and they would have killed him if they could have done so.  He lived because God wanted him to live.  We live in the last dispensation and in the midst of the great work that all the Patriarchs and Prophets since God made the world have spoken of.  Afflictions and tribulations await the world.  The destroying angels have got their sharp sickles in their hands, and they are going to reap the earth.  Everything that has been spoken by the prophets under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost will come to pass in the genera- tion in which we live.  Do not forget it.  I thank God we are as well as we are; that we have as many as we have who are united together in the Priest- hood.  Let us try to live our religion, do our duty, and magnify our calling while we are here.  The eyes of all heaven are over us.  The eyes of the world are over us.  The eyes of the angels are over us.  The Lord has looked upon us and upon the house of Israel to be saviors of the nations. We are here to fulfill these principles.  I pray God my Heavenly Father that as Elders of Israel and as Lat- ter-day Saints we may prize these principles, and that we may do our duty what time we spend here in the flesh.  These Apostles and all the quorums of the Priesthood have a great work upon them.  Every father and mother has a great responsibility resting upon them, to redeem their dead.  Do not neglect it.  You will have sorrow if you do.  Any man will who neglects the redemption of his dead that he has power to officiate for here.  When you get to the other side of the veil, if you have entered into these Temples and redeemed you pro- genitors by the ordinances of the House of God, you will hold the keys of their redemption from eternity to eternity.  Do not neglect this!  God bless you.  Amen.  The anthem, God of Israel hear our prayer, was sung by the choir.  Benediction by Elder C. W. Penrose. Conference adjourned for six months.  The stenographic work in taking the account of the proceedings was done by Arthur Winter.  JOHN NICHOLSON, Clerk of Conference. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS'  EUROPEAN PRINTING, PUBLISHING,  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42, Islington, Liverpool,  June 10th 1893  President Woodruff and Council  Geo Q Cannon and Joseph F Smith  Salt Lake City  Dear Brethren I have  received Your kind Letter informing me of the appointment  of Apostle A. H. Lund to the Presidency of the European Mission  Also giving me the privelege of remaining here longer in the mission  or returning Home according to my better judgement. I would say  in regard to that Section of Land I filed on, in Deseret, the time  to prove up on it, expired last July, but my being in this Country  Mr Hobbs the Land Agent kindly extended tohe time, for one  Year, which will expire next month July, and I think it should  be advertised one month in advance of proving up. takeing this in  view, I thought if President Lund arrive, as we expect, I would  leave here on the Alaska, Sailing Jun 17th. We have Ninety  Six Scandinavian Emigrants, and about Thirty English, listed  for that date, and five, or six, returning missionaries. We had  four Elders as missionaries, arrive here per S S Nevada a few days  ago all well, and were assigned their several fields of Labor their  names are Elders Orson P Hoggan, John Burrows, John Wm Crook and George Thomas. In my returning Home I want to visit some  Boot, ^&^ Shoe, and machinery Firms in Mass and New York State  also spend a few days at the Worlds Fair. Brethren here in the office  are all Well.

We Hope, and Pray, the Lord, will lengthen their days, that they may live to be a Blessing, and a Comfort, to His People, and to  soon hear of their complete restoration to Health.  I received a Letter from  Elder George Reynolds, a few days ago, to purchase certain Arabic Books, which we set ourselves to accomplish.  We found all the Books called for, except  the Calafagos, English and Arabic Dictionary, which we learned are out  of Print, the next nearest to this, we were told is Salmones Dictionary, cost- ing, twenty eight shillings, each, of which we purchased two.  We also have  purchased, six Vols, and index Vol, of Geikies Hours with the Bible, for Apostle F D Richards, we expect these Books, all to be delivered here, in the office tomorrow, and will have some of the returning Elders, who will leave for Home on the 20th take them along with them, please inform Brother Richards of this. The following returning Missionaries, and Saints, will leave here on Saturday  next May 20th, on the S S Alaska, under the charge of Joseph Christiansen, President of the Scandinavian Mission, T. A. and S. B. Clawson, and S M.  Barrett of the London Conference, C W Watts President of the Norwich Conference,  Jacob Tueller Jr, who has come with the Swiss and German Saints from that  Mission, Clarence Taylor and Milton Benion, from New Zealand, on their 
 way Home, making a Tour around the World, and Wilby Dougall Jr taking  an Ocean trip, from Liverpool, to New York and back.  The Work of the Lord,  progresses about as usual in these lands, some little interest being manifested  in certain districts occasionally, there were Eleven Persons Baptized, in the  Sheffield Conference last week.  Last Sunday, I attended the  Irish Conference, held in Belfast, the progress of the Work is very slow on that Island, it is ^a^ hard matter to get anyone to listen to the Gospel Message,  the Prostestant part of the Community, will sometimes receive the Tracks from  the Brethren, but the Catholics are warned by the Priests, to have nothing to  have nothing to do with them, and will often mob the Brethren out of their  Streets, the Police advise the Brethren not to go among them, as they are not strong  enough to protect them, there is a bitter feeling of Antagonism between the Catholics  and Protestants around Belfast, rioting is very frequent, two of our Sisters who  work in one of the Linen Factories, were speaking of fight, which occured a few  weeks ago, in the factory they work in, between the girls, on the Home Rule question  which lasted two weeks, no work being done in that time.  The Proprietors, nor  Foremen, could do nothing with them, the Government had to arrest the leaders, and put them in prison.  Thirteen Missionaries for Great Britian arrived  here last Sunday, on the Alaska, after a very pleasant Voyage, all being well and were each assigned their several fields of Labor.  All the Brethren are feeling well, in the office, we had a very nice rain yesterday, which was very acceptable, it was the first to speak of since the 2nd of March, it is said such a drought has never been known in England before  Praying Our Heavenly Father to Bless You in Health, and Strength, and  to Remember His Work, and Saints, in all the Earth  I Remain Your Brother  Alfred Solomon  Newsy letter  J.

 Mangapai  Nov 1st 1887.  President Wilford Woodruff and Presiding Authorities  Dear Beloved Brethren:  Under the Divine blessings of God we are preserved in health to again address a few lines to you. And in doing so a fervent prayer ascends to God our Eternal Father that they may find you in the enjoyment of perfect health, and every blessing necessary for you to enjoy, to fit you for your great responsibilities and arduous labors. As also a sincere wish for your freedom and prosperity. Realizing, to some extent, how eagerly your movements are watched by the enemies of God's Kingdom. Realizing also how wonderfully you have been preserved in the past.  We feel sure it would be very gratifying to you if you could hear the many fervent and earnest prayers that are offered up to the Throne of Grace, by our dusky friends all over the Island, for God to bless, sustain and preserve you. For they, the Maories, have great reverence and love for the Prophets and Apostles of God living upon the Earth to day.  We have had translated into the Maori language the communication from Prest. Woodruff to the Saints of God throughout the world of August last. And it has been read to the Saints and caused them to rejoice.

 [sideways text]  Wm  Paxman Sept 2nd [18]87 [end of sideways text]  Gisborne, Poverty Bay New Zealand Sept 2nd 1887  To the Counselors of our Deceased Prophet, and the Quoram of the Apostles.  My Dearest Beloved Brethren Upon my arrival at this place, after a four months trip to the South and west part of this Island. I was pained indeed to receive with my home mail, on the 27th  Ulto, the sad and Sorrowful intellegence of the Death of poor aged, avenerable and dearly beloved Prophet President John Taylor; realizing full well that ^at^ this critical period in our history that his valuable Services could it be spared. But the Lord who controls the destinies of men and nations will not Permit any thing to occur to ret- ard the progress of His work, and real- ize also that He can and will raise up ano- ther as great, good and noble as our beloved Prophet who has been So recently called to labor in another Sphere, to carry on His work on the earth;  Yet with all these assurances and the knowledge that we have of the mercies and loving kindness of our Heavenly Father we cannot help but mourn fo the noble and illustrious dead, we, indeed, would be more than mortal if we felt otherwise;  But thanks be to God we have the hope and the assurance, that if we conduct our lives as becom- eth L. D. Saints that we will again meet and clasp hands with that noble Son of God, and that too where there will be no longer the Power of darkness to rule over and bind us in our endeavors 
 Prophet, Seer and Revelator.  We had not contemplated writing to you by this mail, but for the returning home of Elder David Haight by the same steamer that takes this to you.  Elder Haight came here in comp- any with Elder Andrew Corry in January last. Since that time he has been endeavoring to acquire the Maori language. But owing to his memory being so treacherous up to the present time he has not been able to construct a single sentence in Maori. And he has not been able to remember a passage of Scripture. Two weeks ago I received letters from him and the President of his DistrictJohn Ephraim Magleby  setting forth in plainness his condition. The natives are tired of him because he can neither speak in their language nor in English. They feel that he should be assisted by the Lord as he is His servant &c. He therefore and his President (Elder J. E. Maggleby) think it best for him and the Mission that he return home. So in accordance with the re- quest I have released him to return home with Elder William Gardner on Nov 7th. There is no place in the Mission that I could place him to ad- vantage either to himself or the Mission. He feels bad at having to return home in this condition and states that he has fasted, prayed and wept over his con- dition. But finding no change for the better concluded he had better take this course and return home where 
 to do good, but where all will be peace harmony and love, where we can enjoy that Precious boon Liberty! and where Satan will be bound, and those who are taking Such a conspicuous Part in bringing the trials of to day upon the People of God, will be reaping their reward, they indeed will be objects of Pity when they get their just deserts for bringing So much trouble upon the chosen people of God,  There is no doubt in my mind but that all Israel would not have been called to mourn So Soon, had it not been for the Persecutions brought to bear against the leaders of Israel which forced them into exile.  He indeed was a double martyr and died a victim to this last vindict- ive and relentless raid which we are at Present Subject to;  We are going to hold Suitable Services thr^ough^out this Mission on next Sunday the 4th inst, in affectionate rememberance of our deceased Prophet, The Elders and Saints all feel to mourn with the rest of the People of God, and offer up earnest and united Prayers to Him that you my dear Brethren may be abundantly qualified and Sustained to carry on the work and Shoulder the responsibility that now rests upon you.  By the Same mail that brought me the news of the death of President Taylor, also brought the Painful news of the death of my Son George Francis who was at work on the Manti Temple. He was a good Son and died firm in the faith, he was taken Sick verry Suddenly, and only lived four days after, 
 he felt he could do some good for himself and the cause of God. Elder Haight had some means to help pay his passage home. I have loaned him  15.0.0 to make up the amount he was deficient with in- structions to call at the Historian's office and arrange for the sending the amount to me Not knowing how you would wish his fare paid under the circumstances  Elder William Gardner has performed a very successful mission of three and one half years and re- turns home in honor with my blessings and those of the Elders and Saints. He has presided over the Waikato District from its organization, which District, at the late Conference held at Rakaumangamanga, on the banks of the beautiful large Waikato River, was divided into three owing to its immense size. The following is the division. H. J. Manning President and Alma Hayes Traveling Elder in the Waikato, H. J. Burgess President and Boyd Stewart Traveling Elder in the Hauraki, Elias Johnson President and George Romney Jr Traveling Elder in the Bay of Island. I am thankful to be able to state that there is quite an encouraging prospect in all three of these Districts to reap a rich harvest of souls. During the past eight months there has been added to the Church in this District by Baptism and Blessing 108 souls. Quite a number have been baptized quite recently and two new Branches organized. I feel that with the blessings of God a number of new Branches will be added 
 and leaves a wife and one sweet babe, This is quite a blow to me, but the Lords will be done in this as inall other matters,  Since having mailed my last to Presidents John Taylor and Geo. Q. Cannon containing the news of our fellow laborer B. W. Young's Death, I have received a letter from them bearing date of June 24th  and the inspired words therein contained was most welcomely recei- ved and read, it is indeed verry grati- fying to know that the Heavens are nearer to us as a People than they have ever been before and that the Lord continues to give unto His inspired Servants, Knowledge and wisdome from on high,  It was also gratifying to hear that the time seemed to be an opportune one for Utah to again knock at the door of Statehood, and that Prospects were so favorable and bright for her appear to be listened to and granted, the Lord grant that it may be so and that we may have a little choice in the matter of who Shall administer the law unto us. The laws how- -ever unjust we may think them if administered by men, the choice of the People and administered with equality and justice will be quite a God given boon to Suffering Zion.  On my return from my travels in the Southern Part of the Island I found Elders Ezra T. Richards and Sandra Sanders, as also Sister Katie in the enjoyment of good health, and enjoying their labors upon the translation of the Book of Mormon,  I am thankful to State that they have translated up to 
 this summer.  Elder H. J. Sears has been released from the Waikato District and appointed to labor in the Mahia District under Prest. M. S. Marriott. We feel that the harvest is great and the laborours are few Elder George S. Taylor took steamer at Wellington on the 1st of October for home going by way of England. Spring weather is now dawning upon us and it will enable the Elders to get among the people with much greater ease, as the roads, in some parts are almost impassable during our wet weather.  An intelligent young man by the name of John Barton, a half caste, was baptized about three months ago. He has a good English education and has been employed by the Government as interpreter and translator. He man- ifests great interest in the work of God, and states his willingness to assist in the translation of the Book of Mormon free of charge. This I consider as quite providential, as we have been quite un- decided who to get to assist the Elders in going over the work for the last time previous to writing the manuscript for the printer, which work will com- mence about the 1st of December.  The health of the Elders and Sisters laboring here continues good and they all manifest great earnestness in their labors. As a gen- eral rule are acquiring the Maori language quite readily 
 the three hundredth Page of the precious book, and are laboring verry faithfully for the completion of the work.  The Maori's are verry anxious to have the work published, so that they can read its Sacred Pages, and are donating freely and librating of their means to Support the brethern while thus engaged, and look forward with great anxiety when they can read of the dealings of God with their fore- fathers.  The health of the Elders is good with the exception of Elder H. J. Sears, the last I heard from him he was not enjoying the best of health.  Since my last letter to you there has been no marked changes, there is a few being added to the Church all the time. And the Elders con- tinus to Labor with an earnestness and zeal that is quite commendible.  We ever Pray for your Success and happiness and a rich flow of the Spirit of God to attend you.  With much love and best wishes to all, in which Elders E. T. Richards, S. Sanders, E. Johnson and F. H. Wright and Sister Katie joins.  I remain your Brother in the great course of truth Wm Paxman 
 Since last writing you I have attended Conference in the Tauranga District where I found Prest. A. W. Harper and Elder A. Bullock with the Saints rejoicing in the work of God. We there had a time long to be remembered  There was an incident that occurred on our way that I think worthy of note. I in com- pany with Elder Johnson were coming through what is known as the "ninety mile bush" when in turning one of the rocky cliffs we came upon a little waterfall trickling down the side of the mountain. The horse on which my companion was riding shied to one side and he, seeing its proximity to the rocky chasm, dismounted and the horse fell over a cliff some fifty feet high mid a great heap of boulders. And kept on bounding down the side of the mountain some three hundred feet. We at once went down and found him fastened in a thicket of underbrush. We at once cut him loose and after several feeble attempts he gained his feet. The blood was pouring from his nose and was bruised and scared all over. In four and one half hours we again gained the road and proceeded twelve miles farther that night. We attribute it to the hand of God and His Divine wactchcare over His Servants in the discharge of their duties  It will be about two months before I return to Gisborne as I desire to accompany Elders H. J. Manning and H. J. Burgess to Taupo Lake and 
 surrounding country as there is a good prospect for  a great work being done there. Elders Wm. Gardner, Elias Johnson and George Romney Jr who I am now with join me in sending kind love to you and in praying God to bless you in your high and holy calling  I remain your Brother in the great cause of Truth.

 Box 10.  Gisborne, Poverty Bay, N. Z.  Sept 24th 1887.  To Presidents  Geo. Q. Cannon,  Joseph F. Smith,  Wilford Woodruff.  My Dear Brethren:  We have received this day two very  interesting letters, one bearing date of August 2nd from Presidents  Geo. Q Cannon and Jos. F. Smith, the other from President Woodruff,  bearing date of August 16th;  and I now hasten to acknowledge  the receipt of the same, for, the Lord being willing, we desire to leave  on Monday morning for a visit to the North part of the Island and  while thus traveling in Maoridom there is but little convenience or  time for corresponding.  We were delighted with the contents of your letters, and can  say Amen to all the words spoken concerning the greatness and no- bility of character of our deceased leader and Prophet; but as you say  his biography is interwoven with the history of this dispensation, and  it is unnecessary for me to enlarge on his many noble qualities of  heart and mind, all of which are so widely known, and inasmuch  also as I wrote last mail my feelings to you regarding his death.  We were much surprised and amused at the audacity, and  brazen cheek of Uncle Sam in demanding $4,000,00000 of the Church. And for what? Is the Nation in a state of bankruptcy and do they  wish to fill up their coffers with the hard earnings of the people  of God whom they have driven and robbed before and some of  whom they have killed? It seemes as though this step on the part of  the Nation is too glaring an act for the people of the United States even  to look upon without a feeling of insecurity for themselves and their  denominations; for if they can thus rob us, they can in like man- ner rob them, should they happen to fall under the displeasure of  an Edmond or a Tucker. But we do not fear the result, for we know  that the Lord is on our side, and we have every thing to encourage  us. This step against the work of God will, as has been the lot of all  others, result in the complete overthrow of our enemies and the fur- therence of the cause they are seeking to destroy.  We were thankful to hear that the People's Party came out and  did their duty at the polls to the defeating of our Liberal candidates  We think it high time that the Saints were arroused from the lethargy 
 that they have fallen into and be awakened to their duties in  political as well as ecclesiastical matters, for they should have  learned by the sad experiences of the past who are their friends, and  that there is no movement adopted or sanctioned by the leaders  of Israel but that which is for their good.  We were rejoiced to hear of the safe arrival of Elder Correy. The draft that you mentioned of $600.00 came tafe [safe] to hand this mail  to defray the passage expenses of Elder Correy and others, but am sor- ry to say that it was drawn on the bBank of New Zealand Sydney N. S. W., which will cause some delay and expense. All other drafts  that have been sent have been on the Union Bank of Australia, at Gis- borne.  Since writing you, I have received word from Elder Blyth in  Australia that he has received from Brother Correy's the  30 that  he borrowed for Elder Correy's return fare; I therefore shall use the  ammount necessary to pay the  21 borrowed at Auckland for his  "saloon" passage and hold remainder subject to your orders. I wrote  you in a previous letter that Elder Blyth would not return until  next Spring, as he desires to accompany some saints who will emi- grate at that time.  I desire again to mention the progress being made in the trans- lation of the Book of Mormon by Elders Richards and Sanders, feel- ing greatly encouraged, as they have now got 374 pages completed;  and if all is well and by the blessings of God, they anticipate  finishing the work by the first of December next ready for going  over it a second time and rewriting the manuscript for printing  desiring to have it ready for the printer's hands by our next Gen- eral Conference in April. We are already enquiries of several  firms concearning their terms for printing, binding, etc., that we  may be able to lay the same before you in time to receive your  counsel and instruction concerning the same.  Since writing my last letter to you there has been no  marked change in the Mission. The reports received from the  Elders presiding over the various districts are to the effect that,  generally, the Saints are feeling and doing well; but there are  however, in all the districts therose who give way to their former  loose lives, being overcome by adultery, which, I am sorry to  say, is the leading sin in their midst.  The health of the Elders is good so far as I know. Elder  Geo. S. Taylor will leave for home next week, by way of England.  (over) 
 Camebridge Waikato. N. Z. November 25th 1887  President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City  Dear beloved Brother  Today on my arrival at this place, I received your most welcome and interesting letter of the 13th of October, which had been forwarded from Gisborn  to me. I am not able to discribe the joy it afforded me in reading the contents of the same, to hear direct from the leaders of Gods' Kingdom upon the Earth, in relation to the interest and progress of the same, and of the welfare of Gods insp- ired serveants in these trying and per- ilous times, what a time of rejoiceing it must have been to you, as also to the Saints, to have you with them at the late Confrence, if only for one meeting, after such, a long time of seclusion, we were indeed sorry to learn that you had been so unwell 
 and Elder William Gardner in November. The weather still con- tinues quite unsettled, but anticipate fine weather soon. E  Ever praying for the blessings of God to rest upon you,  and the members of the Apostles suited to your high and holy  callings and your peculiar circumstances of to-day, and longing  for the time when you can again mingle with the People. The  Elders and Sister Katie unite with me in sending kind love.  I remain your Brother in the great cause of the Truth,  Wm Paxman  [sideways text] Wm Paxman 24 Sept. 1887  Wm [Auig] 24 S [end of sideways text] 
 caused no doubt, by being over taxed by the many hardious labors prepairing for Con- frence, which must have unfitted you for speaking to that vast congraegation, if they had not heard your voice at all, it would have ^been^ a blessing to them to look upon your face, once again, we are thankfull that the Ene- mies to Gods Kingdom allowed the Confrence to pass of[f] peaceable, without annoying any of our leaders. oh, what a time of rejoicing it will be for all Isreal, when our beloved leaders can again mingle openly with the Saints. God grant that it is not far in the distance, if it will bring about his great purposes, but in all things Fathers will be done.  We were thankfull to know that Elder Corry has arrived home safe and in impr- oved health, as also to learn that Elder Slater had arrived with the corpse of Elder B. YW. Young, and that you approved of the course we took in the same. the Draft that you mentioned to defray the expences occured, arrived 
 all right, and the Savings Bank has been instructed to forward his money to his Father.  Your instructions concerning the care to be used in the revission of the Book of Mormon secureing the best native talant for the purpose, will be strictly carried out.  We are thankfull to be able to announce to you that they are now ready to com^m^ence on the revis- sion haveing just finished the translation for the first time, in which they have been greatly blessed of the Lord.  We rejoice much to learn of the frequent meetings of the Apostles, and of the good health, and spirits they are in possession of.  On the 11th inst I had the pleasure of meeting Elders Angas. T. Wright, Joseph. L. Mecham Joseph. T. Waldron, John. T. Smellie and Chas Johnson Jr. on their arrival at Auckland after a plesent voige all in the injoyment of good health they have been appointed to labor as follows Angas T. Wright in the Poverty Bey, Joseph Mecham in Hawkes Bey, Joseph. T. Waldron Wairarapa 
 John. T. Smellie, Mahia, and Charles Johnson in the Waikato Districts.  I am just in receipt of a Talagraphm from Elder H. J. Sears, stating that he has been released to return home in hast. I was quite surprised as I did not receive any word by my home mail, concerning it. I am also sorry as we are quite short of Maori linquest, he had just been appointed to labor in the Mahia district under President M. S. Marriott to endeavour to open up a new part of the country. I have not learned the particulars receiveing only a short dispatch from him, so do not know in relation to his returning fare weather it has been sent to him or not, if I have to borrow the money for him, I will arr- ange for him to call at the office and report as there will not be time for me to Send further word, after hearing from him, by the next steamer  Since my last letter to you there has been a new Branch organized in this the Waikato district, with a good prospect of two if not 
 three more being organized about Christmass, as our dusky friends set that time for being Baptised into the Church as they have arranged among themselves to all come into the Church about the same time, there are three villages of them a Short-distance apart, in company with Elder H. J. Manning President of the Waikato District I enjoyed my visit to them very much, as they drank in our words and we  felt the Seeds was being Sown in good grou -nd, we trust in a few weeks will bring forth a rich harvest,  the report from the various Districts are good, good weather has now Set in, and the Elders will labor with great dilligence during the Summer months, in endeavering to Spread the truth among thoes not in the  church as we have many new fields that we desire to open up, which can be done to much better advantage during the Summer months, as far as I am aware the health of the Elders ^and^ Sisters from Zion is good, with the exceptions of Elder John 
 L Blyth who is laboring in Australia, a letter received from him yesterday State that he is not enjoying the best of health, and being alone it makes it quite unplesent for him, I shall be thankfull when he gets some help, he is feeling well in Spirits and doing all that lay in his power to Spread the truth in that part of the Lords vineyard  there is general good health among our native Saints at this time and a desire manifested on their part to Keep the commandments, a greater interest is being manifested among the young to get Married by the Elders of the Church last Monday we had the pleasure of celebrating three marrages, we improved the oppertunity of talk- ing in plainness upon this and other princi- ples of God, unto a large assembly of both Saints and Strangers,  I am now on my way to Lake Toupo in company with Elder H. J. Manning a new part of the Mission. My health is good and I am enjoying my labors much, feeling that I am 
 of you, in your high holy and responsible callings, and with profound love to you all in which Elder H. J. Manning who I am now with join which also all the Elders and Sisters would gladly do if they were present; I remain your Brother and Co laborer in the great cause of truth  William Paxman.  P.S. I have not as yet had the pleasure of reading the last Epistle, if there has been any pub- lished in pamphlit form, I would much like to receive a few coppies for the Elders Wm P.

 Gisborne  Poverty Bay P. O. Box #10 New Zealand  January10th 1888  President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Beloved Brother:  It is by the kindness and blessings of  Our Heavenly Father that we are permitted to ad- -dress you in the enjoyment of health and strength,  and I trust the spirit of this important mission,  at this the commencement of another year, and I  feel that we as saints can hail with joy each  new year, knowing as we do know, that each  one will bring about great changes for the good  and welfare of the Israel of our God, and each  one brings us nearer our redeemprtion, which God  will surely give unto us in His own due time,  and may this present one bring about liberty for  the saints of God, if that would be for our best  good.  Your kind welcome and interesting  letter of Nov 4th came duly to hand, and was read  with great interest, as the great distance we are  from head quarters, the leaders of God's people,  makes a letter doubly welcome. We were indeed  pained to learn of you having such a bad cold  and cough, a [page torn] desire that long ere 
 this you have been restored to perfect health and  strength to enable you to perform your many duties  and labors, that are required of you in your high  and holy calling.  Elder H. J. Sears was released to return  home by the December Steamer, but being disappoi nted in getting his passage money he did not leave  Auckland for home until the 2nd inst. The check  for $12500 for his return fare came safe and was  forwarded to him. $15000 is the amount that has  been sent for the previous Elders, until this time, which amount, if the church is able to continue sending is we think little enough as in most cases it takes  from $1000 to $2000 for them to reach Auckland,  where owing to the time the Steamers run, they have to  stay one week paying for their board, and in most every  instance their clothes are to shabby for them to return  home with.  We are thankful to state that Elders J. J. Jackson  for this Island, and Robert Lindsey and S. D. Chipman  for Australia arrived at their fields of Labor in saf^e^ty,  having had a good and pleasant voyage.  The appointing of a receiver for the Church pro- perty, is indeed a new act in the great thieving  drama of this powerful nation. Surely the wisdom of  the wise has perished. It is very gratifying to us to  know that the feel [page torn]mes outside of the 
 Territory is more micld towards us, as also to learn that  there is not that vindictiveness on the part of the officials  in our Territory, although I see that many of our bre- -thern are being sent to prison.  Was sorry to hear of the unusual dry season coming,  so much severe sickness in the midst of the saints,  but I trust winter with her storms has before this  brought health to the homes of the saints.  We rejoiced to learn of the good health of the  Apostles, and do earnestly pray that it may contin- ue, that they may be the power in the hands of the  Lord required at this important time in the history  of the Church.  Your kind mention of the translation of the Book  of Mormon was thankfully received and we greatly  desire to be able to fully put your kind suggestions  into practice. At our last writing we thought that  we had secured a good native assistant to help in the  revision of the work, but for some cause he failed to  come makeing a very slimsy excuse, we also obtained  a promise from the second one, with the same results,  this did not discourage us in the least for we knew  that this was the Lords work and that He would  raise up some suitable person for us, which we are  thankful to say he has done in the person of  Henare Ptae, one that has a thorough knowledge  of the Maori language. 
 Hastings, Hastings District, Hawke's Bay, New ZealandHastings, Hawks Bay, New Zealand.  April 12th 1888.  President Wilford Woodruff and Quorum of Apostles,  Dear Beloved Brethern:  It is through a kind Providince, and a loving Father, that we are once more permitted to address you by letter; and in doing so feel to offer up a silent, but fervent prayer that it may reach its destination, and find you all, in the full enjoyment of health, and under the Divine care and protection of our ever kind and loving Father in Heaven; for when I reflect upon the present condition of your- selves and the Church, I see and feel that you need an increase of the power, wisdom and blessings of God; and to this end very earnest prayers are offered up daeily, yea hourly, by the Elders and saints in this far off land, the nethermost part of the earth. Fearing as we do, from the reports that reach us, from the various parts of Zion, that the saints have not harkened unto the voice of God through His in- spired prophets, in honoring God, and setting their houses in order, and purging out sin and iniquity from their midst, which if done would have given us unity and strength, so much so, that our enemies would not have the power over us that they have today. 
 Elders Ezra F. Richards and Sondra Sanders for with  his assistance have just finished the revision of the first  and second Books of Nephi, and we are most thankful  to state, that the (Henari Potae) pronounces the trans- lation as being very good indeed, far better then he  thought it could have been done and if this is the  case of the first part of their work, it will be  still better as they get further along, as they feel, that  by the blessings of God, they improved much in the  course of their labors, this mention is made to show  that they were blessed and inspired of the Lord for  the work they had been appointed and set apart to  perform. We feel that when the revision is completed  that there will be a very good and correct translation,  one that will be quite plain, and will convey to the  minds of the Maori people the meaning in the  same plainness and simplicity and with the  same accuracy, the glorious truths contained in  that devine record, that our edition does to us.  The Lord willing, we hope to have the revision com- pleted and the manuscript ready (or nearly so) for  the printers by our annual conference which will  commence on the 6th of April at Te Hauke, near  Napier, at which there will be present the leading  priesthood and saints of our dusky friends, (the  Maori's), we then desire to lay before them the  cost of printing and binding and adopt some 
 but thanks be to Our Heavenly Father, He has promised to give us a glorious victory; to raise up one Mighty and Strong, to deliver us, in the appointed time.  We pray God to bless you, and the faithful with patience, wisdom, and every needed blessing, until that happy times arrives.  I am truly thankful to state that my health is good, and I am rejoicing much in my labors, but, feel a little weary in body through the great amount of labor that has been upon me during our conference, which commenced on Friday the 6th, and closed on Monday the 9th inst.    During the four days, twenty three meetings were held by the Saints, priesthood and Elders from Zion; there being twenty five in attendance, and two Sisters, as also a large gathering of the saints from the various parts of the Island; and above all the Lord Our God was with us by the power of His spirit; to the great rejoicing of all the saints, and Elders present.  In our council meetings we truly had a time never to be forgotten, for so great was the power and inspiration of God poured out upon us, that we shed tears of joy, and our hearts swelled within us for the goodness and loving kindness of our Heavenly Father thus bestowed upon us.  The saints of this district built a fine meeting house for the Conference, with seats, capable of holding three hundred people, the first house among 
 method of raising the means necessary to defray the  expenses of the same, which we trust we will have  no great difficulty in obtaining.  In a former letter, it was stated, that we were  obtaining prices for printing and binding, from the  leading establishments in New Zealand, we have  now received the same, and will here quote the  best terms received, from the "Star Office", in Auckland,  quite a large and reliable firm, having compositers that  understand Maori, which is a great advantage, the  prices quoted are for a book of 650 pages, size of leaf  5 x 7 inches, with good paper and type, a sample  of each they have furnished us, they say.  Our price for 2000 copies not more then 656 pages,  bound in leather as per sample herewith inclosed would  be  420.0.0d, for 1000 additional copies  150.0.0d  If found in cloth (sample inclosed)          2000 copies  385.0.0d     1000 additional copies  125.0.0d      thus you see, that by having the 3000 copies, they  will cost, in leather 3s-10d each or 95 cents, in cloth  3s-5d or 85 cents, these figures are 40 percent lower than  any others we have received, and from the most reliable establishment, and we think them very reasonable.  Not knowing where you would desire the publishing  to be done, here or in Zion, we take pleasure in forward- ing to you the afore figures, and will now wait your 
 the saints of this Island that has been furnished with seats; it was filled to its upmost capacity during the meeting of Conference, and their dusky faces beamed with joy as they listened to the inspired words of the  Servants of God, and those that had the privilege of speaking. During our meetings many expressed them- selves as being filled with joy and rejoicings for the things they had heard, and the power they had felt, and desired to be firm and steadfast unto the end for they knew it was the true Gospel, Ect.  During the whole of our conference there was nothing occured to mar our pleasure, or the peace of the company; all was love and good will.  Ample accommodation were made for feeding and caring for the whole com- pany of not less then four hundred souls.  Quite a number of these where outsiders, who had come to listen to the truth.  It is no small affair to provide and care for a gathering of this kind, as all that come have to be fed during the time of their stay, by those who live at the place of gathering.  It is done by free will gifts, some making large presents of food; a non-member of the Church, brought a large van, drawn by four large horses some fifteen miles, containing a ton of flour, eight 40 lbs bags of sugar, a sack of rice, a box of tea, four sacks of shell fish, and a quantity of sweet and Irish potatoes.  I mention this to show the liberality of the natives, in this respects, and the 
 instructions. We would be most thankful to receive any  information from Brother Geo Q. Cannon, or others, in re- lation to the number best to print? the best method to ad- opt to obtain the required means? &c. We mention brother  Cannon, because he has had an experiance with a sim- ular people and work, the printing and finding  will take about one year.  At our Conference in April, the following named  Elders will be honorably released to return home to the  bosom of the church and friends, having performed  good, long faithful missions, Viz.  Ezra F. Richards who has been here 3 1/2 years, the  last year he has labored on the translation of the Book  of Mormon, Francis H. Wright, Alfred W. Harper,  Elias Johnson and John L. Blyth, who will have  been here at the time of our conference three years, they  have all presided over Conferences, and have done  a good work, and will return home with honors, my  blessings and the blessings of the Elders and saints.  Please send the amoung for their return fares, ex- cept Elder Blyths, as his fare has already been sent,  at your earliest convenience, on the Union Bank of  Australia at Napier, as that will be the nearest  to our conference, and the place from which the  Elders will leave.  We will also be pleased to have five or six Elders  sent to this Island at your convenience, Young men 
 manner in which the large gathering was fed.  For the accommodation of the Elders, a large tent was erected and a temporary table, sufficiently large to seat thirty persons, with plates, dishes &c., to make it very pleasant, and the food furnished us was extra good. The Elders greatly rejoiced at having the opportunity of thus meeting together, it being thirteen months since our last general con- ference of the mission.  We also had the pleasure of Elder John L. Blyth's company, who has been laboring in Australia for the past three years, comparatively alone, in the midst of much opposition, and has by the blessings of God succeded in opening up the work in that part of the vineyard, organizing two branches &c. He is now on his return home to Zion, and will accompany Elders, Ezra F. Richards, F. H. Wright, Elias Johnson, A. W. Harper and Alma Hayes, all of which, except the last names, have performed good and faithful missions, laboring untiringly for the advancement of the cause of God, among this strange people; and they now return with an honor- -able release, my blessings, and blessings of the Elders and saints, and above these, the blessings of the Lord.  Elder Hayes returns through sickness; his constitu- tion seems to be broken down.  He tells me that he had two conjestive chills before he came here, 
 from 20 to 30 years of age are much preferable, as  they can acquire the language much more readly,  as also stand the climate & c the best, would like one  or two of them suitable for teaching school.  There are some few of our dusky friends that are  becoming quite anxious about gathering home to  Zion, About a year ago we wrote at some length  about the emigration of this peculiar people, giving  our opinion from what we had seen, about a suit- able place being selected for them, their mode of  living &c &c. If you have any instructions upon  this, and other matters we would be thankful to  receive them by our confereance.  We have recently returned from a three mounths  trip to the north part of the Island, and are very thank- ful to be able to state that the great majority of the  Saints, are endeavoring to live in accordance with the  principles of the Gospel, and they manifest quite a  love for the truth, as also for the servants of God, and  awe are able to see a marked improvement in their con-  dition, yet, there are those that become weary in the  service of the Lord, and return back to the beggarly  things of the world, adultry being the prevailing crime  among them, but, generally when they are caught in  the same, they will come forth and confess and seek  to be restored in fellowship, they are very peculiar  for this, so unlike the europeans. 
 and since his arrival in this land, he has had two severe attacks of sickness, suffering much with his lungs.  For the last two months we have had him staying with a kind family of europeans to be nursed up, but, in it all, he improves but little; he cannot ride horse back, nor walk but a short distance, so it became neccessary to release him to return home.  Elder Robert Lindsay, who was sent to Australia last nNovember has also got a constitution that has been shaken badly by sickness and exposure in his youth.  Since his arrival in his field of labor he has gradually failed in health, suffering much from his lungs, until he got so weak that he could not walk around; yet, he has a great desire to fill an honorable mission.  So he wrote to me, desiring to have the privilige of going to his native land, Scotland, to visit his relatives, and there fill a mission.  I have released him to go and report himself to President George Teasdale at Liverpool, and have appointed A. L. Stewart to go and labor with S. D. Chipman, who has been appointed to succeed Elder Blyth.  Through the faithful and earnest labors of Elder's Ezra F. Richards and Sondra Sanders Jr., assisted by some native helep, the revision of the translation of the Book of Mormon was completed in time to present at our Conference; making it a little less then one year from the time of commencing the 
 During our trip, four new branches and two new conferences were organized, there were also quite a  number added to the church by baptism, and since  my return, Elders Elias Johnson and George Romney Jr, writes that they have added 42 others to the Church  and organized another branch thus we are able to  report the work of the Lord spreading among the branch  of the house of Israel, to our great rejoicing.  The health of the Elders is good, and with but few  exceptions are making excelent progress in obtaining  a knowledge of the Maori language, and those that  have the language are laboring with a great perseverence  among those not of our faith during the summer mo- nths, and we trust their labors will be crowned  with abundant success.  Since last writing, we have received some copies  of the Epistle of the Apostles, which have been greatly  enjoyed by us, and we can say a hearty amen to  every sentiment and feel that such Epistles should  be a great blessing to all Saints. We wait with  great anxiety the arrival of each mail, feeling that im- portant changes can take place in a month, in these  peculiar and interesting times, we are also quite in- terested in Utah being admitted into Statehood, if that is the will of our Heavenly Father, truly these  are most peculiar times, yet, at the same time we are led to rejoice at seeing so visable the hand of God 
 translation.  To get it finished by this time, they had to work early and late.  Some portions of the translation was read at the conference, and pro- nounced by the best Maori linguist as being very good and plain, 400 pages of the book is copied or rewritten ready for the press.  The work now re- maining, is to finish writing the manuscript and read it over before a suitable Maori.  Elder S. Sanders Jr., have been appointed to this labor, assisted by sSister Katie.  He has also been appointed to preside over this, the Hawks Bay district.  In presenting it to the conference, and calling upon the saints for the means necessary for the printing and binding of the same, it was not received with that spirit of liberality that we could have desired.  This people have a great dread of being asked for means, as they have been so badly duped and swindled by the former churches; stating, "that the ministers pointed to heaven with one hand while they would steal their lands from under their feet with the other, yet, I have faith that the means will come from some quarters when needed.  Elder John L. Blyth, seeing the feelings and con- dition of the people, was inspired to give  50 fifty pounds to assist in this noble work.  This means his brother gave him in Australia, to pay his fare home.  I will enclose with this a Financial Statement 
 of means collected and expended, up to date of our conference since which  18.8.0 have been collected, besides the  50 from Elder Blyth.  The great majority of the people are very poor, and handle but little means. How the means will be collected I do not know, but, have faith that it will be forth coming in some way.  The feelings at conference, was to have 2000 copies printed and bound.  We much regretted that we detid not receive any letter from you in answer to our inquiries, feel- ing as I do, that there had been a letter sent that should have reached us, but owing to some unknown cause it did not arrive.  I cannot tell how great was my disappointment, and those of the Elders.  We shall take no action about the printing un- til we hear from you.   The remittance, for the return fares of the Elders, came safe, as also the amount sent in January for Elder Haight's return Ect.  Both drafts being in excess of the amounts sent for.  That of Jany.  9.0.0 and the last  8.0.0 making a total excess of  17.0.0 which amount I will use for the return fare of Elder Alma Hayes, with the additional sum of  13.0.0 which you will please send to me at your convenience on the Union Bank of Australia at Napier. N. Z.  This amount of  13.0.0 will balance our accounts up to date.  No doubt, but the fault is with me, 
 made bare in the defence of His covenant people,  and in the overthrow of the powers of the earth, sur^e^ly  Uncle Sam should turn his attention from Utah and  her people, to the fearful internal workings of his own  people, who are preparing to lay waste every City,  town and hamlit and bring destruction and death  to his people, the saints can well afford to wait  the Lords time in all things.  We are deeply interested in your welfare, and that  of the Apostles, knowing the powers that are brought  to bear against you, and of the great responsibilityies  resting upon you, earnest prayers continually ascend  unto Our Father and God, for His power, wisdom  and guidance to be with you, and all the leaders  of Israel.  Elders Ezra F. Richards, Sondra Sanders Jr, F. H.  Wright and Angus T. Wright as also sister Paxman  and Sister Marriott, who is writing the manuscript  ready for the printers, write with me in profound  love to you and the quorum of the Apostles.  Again stating that we will be most happy to hear  from you, and carry out any council you may be led  to give.  I remain your Brother and colaborer in the  great cause of Truth  Wm Paxman 
 Awapuni, New Zealand. June 6th [18]88  President W. Woodruff and Quorum of Apostles.  Dear Beloved Brethren; Your kind and much appriciated letter of ^the^ 3rd of April came duly to hand, and was read with deep interest, and I now fear that I was not considerate enough of your many labors, expecting an answer to mine in so short a time, if so, it was from the great desire I had to hear from you before our conference, and often in our anxiety we do not carefully weigh the surroundings as we should before we Jump at conclusions. Therefore I beg to be excused, and hope to exercise more patience in the future. 
 in these amounts having being sent, through not making it fully plain to you.  With this I take pleasure in forwarding to you the Statistical report for the year ending Jany 31st 1888 by which you will see an addition of nine branches, and two new districts.  At our Conference, the Wairarapa district was devided into two, making twelve districts or Conferences in the mission; 343 have been added to the Church by baptism, and 163 children blessed, making an increase of 506.  Since January 31st there  has been over 100 more added to the Church, and the prospects for the future are very flattering in- deed, especially in the North.  The Elders and Sisters have now been assigned their fields of labor as floollows;  Wairarapa District.  N. S. Bishop  Prestident Boyd Stewart Traveling Elder, Manawatu Dist.   J. W.

 P. S. Jany 16th  Since writing the above we have just re- ceived your very interesting and instructive letter of the  12th of Dec 1887. We were thankful to learn of your  improved health, as also the good health of the Apostles.  It is also most gratifying to know that the Lord  has so wonderfully preserved the leaders of Israel from  imprisonment, while such strenuous effort are being  made to capture them, surely we are led to praise  God all the day long.  It truly is a "day of shaking" and one that is  increasing the faith of the saints in the living God,  and preparing us for the day of seperation, draw- ing the deviding line. What a consolation to know  that Our Heavnly Father, Joseph, Hyrum, Brigham  and John with all the holy Prophets and Apostles that  have lived upon the earth, is on our side, and will  advocate our cause, and bring about our deliverance  in the appointed time of the Lord.  We watch with great interest the movements  of the Receiver and of our enemies, through the  medium of the Deseret News, and feel that Zion  has much to be thankful for.  You will please find inclosed the statement  asked for. I find that to get the returns in time  for the returning Elders, it will be necessary to  answer this by the return of mail, which leaves 
 We were delighted to hear of the good health prevailing in your midst, and sincerily desire and pray, that the same may continue.  Your kind discription of Bro Geo Q Cannons labors upon the translation of the Book of Mormon into the Hawaiian language was verry interesting indeed.  And we will here state that we had access to two good Native schoars, to ask for information and explanations during the time of translation, as also during the revision, and since receiving your much appreciated letter, we have secured (3) three excelent Natives to assist in the reading over carefully of the manuscript. All three are good in the Maori, and two excellant in the english 
 languge; And coming as they do from different parts of the Island, we feel that it will come forth the best that it can; for we will indeavor to carry out your instructions to our ut- most. These Brethren are J.A. Jury a half east, Piripi Te Maari, and Hakopa Ratama. The two first are men of  more of means and influence, and they have given me to understand that they would come to my assistance with their means, so that the printing might be done as soon as possible. They are also anxious that (3,000) three thousand coppies should be printed instead of 2,000, as voted upon at our conference, as I have already wrote you.

I am truly thankful to be able to state, that they go to their respective fields of labor fully satisfied, and with a determination to do all that lays in their power to fully magnify their high and holy callings; to the saving of souls, and the glory of God. There has not been a murmur, nor the least com- plaint presented, but on the other hand a willing- ness manifested, that fills me with joy and thanks- giving; for I feel that I have a noble lot of colabores

 So we feel the Lord is indeed  blessing us and opening up our way in a marvelous manner, as it was pronounced upon my head, when I was set apart for this mission. We feel to praise God for these blessings, and for all others that I can see daily is being bestowed upon us.  Elder S. Sanders Jun and Sister Katie are now writing the manuscript at Te Hauke, and in about four to six weeks the reading will commence, so that we will soon be ready for printing.  I am indeed sorry to have to report the ^severe^ sickness of Elder L. J. Mecham, of Milton, Morgan Co., who came here last November.

In a few days I will levave on a visit to the South and west Coast, holding meetings, Conferences Ect.   During the whole of our con- ference through a kind Providence, we have been blest with delightful weather, more fine pleasant weather then we have had for some time past.  All the Elders and Sisters unite with me in sending fond and earnest love, and sincere wishes for your safty and prosperity, with a longing desire to hear from you, to learn of your welfare and that of Zion.  Ever praying for the blessings of God to rest upon you, suited to your present needs,  I remain your Brother in Meekness.  Wm Paxman  [sideways text] Wm Paxman 12 April [18]88 [end sideways text] 
 Wm Paxman,  10 Jan 1888 
 Since which time he has had several hard spells of sickness, mostly upon his lungs, but now he has the reheumatism as well. He informs me that he has sufferd with his lungs for seven years before he came here. He has man- ifested great anxiety to stay and fill his mission, fasting and praying, and receiving the ordinance of the laying on of hands, but he has not received any permanent releief, but has yet got quite sick, so I have deemed it best to release him to return home by this steamer that will carry this to you. I wish to say in his justifycation that he has been exceedingly diligent in 
 obtaining the language, and have done as well in the same length of time as anyone that has come to the island, and I much dislike to be under the necessity of sending him home, as we are so verry short of Maori linguest, in the mission. I have borrowed the amount ^for his return fare^ of Bro Charles Hardy of Auckland, who has donated ten pounds ( 10) of the same to the Manti Temple.  So please send to me a receipt for that amount in his favor, and the balance on the Union Bank of Australia at Auck- land, as I will be in that naborhood soon after the receipt to an answer to this, if the Lords willing.

 Elders and Sisters from Zion as far as I now know is good with the exception of colds, which is quite previelent at this season of the year; so many changes of the climate in one day, and so much wet. The Elders are laboring with great diligen ce, But during the winter they cannot do as much, as in some parts, the roads are almost im- passable; In a letter received yesterday from Elder George Romney Jr, he stated that the horses were scarcely able to get through the mud with their bl- ankets etc, they having to walk, much of the roads are only bridle  paths, upon clay ground, through timber and brush. There is general good health prevailing 
 in the midst of the saints, as also an increased desire to live the princyples of truth. Yet we have continualy some cases of sin to cause us to grieve, for this people are so prone to go astray, much like the children of Israel. I now know how to sympathise with that great Prophet, "Moses," in his tryials. I donot blame him for getting righteously mad and breaking the tablets, ##Exodus 32:19## although I am thankfull to state that I have not had to get verry mad, but it do require great wisdom and patience; which I have not only as the Lord give it me. Since I last wrote you, in company with Elders John W. Kauleina- moku, and N. S. Bishop, I have  
 made a visit through the Wairarapa district, holding conference there, and then we travelld around the west coast visiting many places of those not in the church, holding meetings with them. And we are now in the Mananwatu district where we will hold Conference next Saturday and sunday. We have Just been introducing Elder Kauleina- moku into this new district, feeling that by the blessings of the Lord he will open up a good work around the west coast; as there are many Maories living upon the same. He has been apointed to preside over this district of country. The Elders now on their way here 
 will land on or about the 20th We are greatly in need of them, and sincerly hope they will be able to indure this climate, and do a good work. It was most gratifying to learn that the roof would be placed on the Tem- ple in Salt Lake City this present season. I was also much de- lighted to learn of the home industries of Z. C. M. I. as these things are verry pleasing to me. news of your late con- ference has reached us and read with great interest, especialy so the epistle, drinking in every sentance of the same. In re- lation to Statehood, we would rejoyce if we could obtain that ^great^ boom, but Father controols those things, and it will be all right 
 either way. By the papers we see the raid against the saints of God still go on with renewed diligence, it shurely should cause the saints to turn unto their God with full purpose of heart. You will please excuse brevity as there is so little accommodations for writing while travelling among our dusky friends.  I will write more full at some future time.  Elders J. W. Kaulei- namoku. N.

Woodruff and Quorum of Apostles,  Much beloved Bretheren,  We feel that we are greetly blessed; to have this another opportunety of  addressing a letter to you, and especi- aly so, to be in receipt of another  of your esteemed favors, bearing the  date of July 19th, which came safe  to hand; as also the receipt in favor  of Charles Hardy for ( 10) ten pounds,  donation donation to the Manti Temp- le. Also a check for ( 15) fifteen pounds,  the balance of the return fair of El- der Meacham; In reading your much  appricated letter, we could not help  but feel in part the great anxiety and  burden that rests upon you, in these  most trying times; and the feelings  of our hearts go out unto our Kind 
 loving Father in Heaven, for His power  and blessings to be ever with you; It  was very gratifying to us, to learn th- at there was a fair prospect of a [uecuring]  the Holy temples, meeting houses and other  Sacred places, from the hands ^of the^ wicked.  God to grant that it may be so overruled.  We will be much pleased to learn of the  success of Elder Jos. H. Deen upon the  Samoin Islands, for we feel with you,  that there are many of the inhabitance  of these Islands that will receive the  Gospel, was sorry to learn of the severe  dry summer you had had in Utah;  By this last mail a draft came for the  return fair of Elder S, Sanders, H. J Man- ning and M. S. Marriott & wife Elder S. Sanders  having comepleated his labor upon the M ss  of the book of Mormon, returned home by  the Sept Steamer I borrowed  30 for his  return fare and find by the draft that  only  25 each has been sent. The other two 
 Elders and Sister Marriott, will return  home in Nov next, and my wife Katie  will also accompany them, as she is near- ing the time of her confinement, and  there are no conveniances for women to  pass through that ordeal in Maoridum  She has preformed a good faithful labor as a missionary, with out offering the  least complaint, we feel that she can  return home quietly and be quite safe,  with her Parents. I will have to borrow  the means for her return fare, which  you will please send to me on the Un- ion Bank of Australia, of Auckland  at your earliest conveniance. For some  some cause I have not yet received only  a part of my mail that came by the  last Steamer, so do not know whether  there was a letter from you or not, but  think prehaps there is, as the draft came  and I feel much disapointed that it  has not come to hand. I am thankful  I am than to be able to state that my 
 health is good, and that I am feeling splendid  splendid in my labors. Sometimes I get quite  tired and sore, but what of that, it is in a good  cause. It is with much pleasure that we  inform you, of the delivery of the Mss of  the Book of Mormon, in Maori into the  printers hands in Auckland, on the  4th of Sept, to have two thousand cop- ies printed, and bound in leather, that  being as many as we could execrcise faith  in having printed at this time; for at a  conference held just before we sent the M- SS to Auckland, there was a strong feeling  manifested by the Native breathren, not  to have it printed now feeling that they  could not raise the means required for the  payment of the same, but, by the power  of blessings of God, and laying before  them, that it was Gods Holy book, that  had been held in reserve to come  forth in the fulness of times, to give  them an understanding of their fore Fathers, and the pure Gospel of Christ. 
 [sideways text] April 11 [18]89 Pres. Wm Paxman New Zealand Rcd May 15 [18]89 [end of sideways text]  Te Hauke, New Zealand, April 11th 1889.  President Wilford Woodruff, and Quorum of Apostles:  Dear and beloved Bretheren;  We cannot find words to fully express to you the great joy we have in the Lord at being spared in health and strength to once more address you by letter, from this, a small island of the sea, at the nethermost part of the earth. Yet in so doing we feel to offer up a silent, though fervent prayer to our loving Father in Heaven, that this may reach you in safety, and find you in the full enjoyment of health and every blessing of the Lord suited to your high and holy callings, and the great labors devolving upon you at this peculiar period in the history of the Church.  How we were made to rejoice and praise the Lord our God for the good news that came to us by the last mail, viz., the freedom of Pres Woodruff and Cannon, af- ter so long a confinement, to again mingle with and instruct the Saints of Israel in the great things of God; feeling as we do that it has not come any too soon for the good and welfare of Zion; for when the shepherds are absent, the flock is apt to become more or less affected. We feel that a reformation will now take place in the midst of the Saints, and all Israel will be made to 
 And sho^w^ing unto them that they would  not be any better prepaired in one or two  years from now, then they are at this  time, and that there was great danger  in delays, etc, they consented to have  the work go on at once, and subscribed  means enough to make the first pa- yment of  150 0 0, the next payment  of the same amount is to be made  when the printing is half done, and  the remainder of  120 0 0 on the  complecian of the work, they, the prin- ters are under a contract to do their  work according to agreement and sp- eciments, etc, and I am under contract  to make the payments as they becom  due, and I have faith that the Lord  will open up the way if we do our  part faithfuly, the work is to be  finished by our general confrence next  April; We feel that the Bk of Mormon  will be the means of bringing many  to the knowledge of the truth, and 
 rejoice, both at home and abroad.  While you were, with the many Saints rejoice- ing in conference in Salt Lake City, we also were rejoicing in our annual ^conference^, which has just closed at this place, and at which were in attendance thirty one of the Elders from Zion, as also a large at- tendance of our dusky friends from all the districts, except that of Tauranga. Great were the rejoicings of all present, as the spirit of God was so abundantly ^bestowed^ upon both speakers and hearers, and many were the words of inspiration that were spoken during the five days that we were together, two of which were occupied by the Elders in council, in which we were one and all melted to tears of joy as great was the spirit of God that was in our midst causing each one to arise to his feet and praise the living God; for we ^were^ enabled by the power of his Holy Spirit to testify [t]hat He is our Father and that we are His delegated sons, the embassadors of our Lord Jesus Christ. Every selfish feeling that might have been in our hearts was swallowed up in the love of God, and we were led to rejoice much that our lot has been cast upon this island to labor among this benighted and sinful people, a portion of the House of Islrael. They have such faith in a Supreme being, as also in the Bible, that many of them are led to receive the truths of 
 breaking down some of the strong bariors  that we now have to contend with, in the  Shape of Maori prophets, who are leading  many into sin, and disbelief in the bible,  there fore our great anxiety to have  it printed at once. Our Statistical report  for the six months ending July 31st  show an increas of eighty baptisms  and twenty children blessd, over that  of the same period of last year, for wh- ich we are led to praise God, and we  have still bright prospects for the  future, as we generally do much better  during the Summer then the winter  months. The health of the Elders is now  good as far as I have learnt. Elders George  Romney Jr and David Muir have both been  quite unwell with bad colds, but are  feeling well again, for which I feel  very thankful. Since my last letter to  you I have visited six districts, attendid  conferences in the same, and it is most  gratifying to me to be able to state 
 the Gospel soon as they hear them, for they see that they are precisely the same as taught by Christ and His apostles. And many, very many others would receive the same if it were not for the power exercised by the chiefs ofver the various tribes. This power however will sooner or later be broken down as that every hon- est soul may rejoice in the truth. We see a great change in the respect in ^during^ the past three years, for wherever the Gospel is received, it does away to a great extent with their feelings of cheifship, or desires to keep others in subjection. This was quite marked dur- ing our conference, as we had quite a number of leading cheifs in attendance, yet they were humble as children and one with the Saints in all things. And we were also made to rejoice in beholding the  great improvment the Saints are making in know- ledge and faith in the Gospel, as also their personal apperanance and deportment, and willingness to hearken unto counsel.  One of the leading features of the conference and one that gave great joy unto the Saints, was hav- ing five hundred copies of the Book of Mormon in Maori, to distribute amongst them. Never were chil- dren more anxious to receive their Christmas pres- ents, than were this people to receive that holy book. And although nearly all present had paid from five 
 that I find a good spirit prevailing am- ong the Saints, and fully as much  improved, as we could naturally expect,  after so long a training in sin and  every visious habit. I feel that they are  doing wonderfully well, as we are able to  to see the advancements made by them  through traveling and mingling with  those not in the Church, as I have  to do in traveling from one district to  another. I am pleased to State, that wh- ere-ever we go we have the priveledge  of holding meetings and beering testim- ones to the truth of the Gospel, and  warning the people of the great  day of God, for it is seldom that I  do not hold from eight to ten meetings  a weak and often more then that. We  are organiazing Sunday schools in  many of the branches, and we find  they have a verry benefical offect, for  great interest is taken in them, by yo- ung and old, and when we receive the- 
 Kiri Kiri, N. Z. July 11th 1889  President Wilford Woodruff,  And Counselors.  Much beloved Brethren,  We are just in receipt of your  long and most interesting epis- tle of the 23rd of May, And now  hasten to pen a few lines in  reply. Seeing that it arrived  too late for us to return by the  present mail Steamer, that  you may know that it was  received, as also of our moove- ments. But it will necessarly  have to be brief for the lack  of time, as we are now trav- ling through the district, holding  conferences.  We had learned by the pre- vious mail, of the Organ- azation of the First Presidency 
 shillings (the price of a book) to five pounds and upwards, and were entitled to receive copies without any fur- ther payments, yet so great was their joy, that about eighty paid for their books five shillings each saying that they had joy in so doing, as it was their desire to assist in raising the balance yet due on the final payment that there might be a fund on hand for the publishing of other works, as they desire to recieve all that God has revealed for the guidance and blessing of His children. When I was set  apart for this mission, among other great promises and blessings that were pronounced upon me, was that means nescessary to carry on this work should be raised in a mysterious manner, and surely this has been the case from the commencement until this time, for most of the means have come in quite a mys- terious manner, and as the payments have become due just enough to pay them has been forthcoming, and for the last payment the Saints have exceeded our most sanguine hopes or expectations. With this a statement will his furnished showing the receipt and disbursements and balance on hand which I feel will be most gratifying, for beside the balance of  80.12.5 we have collected  18.3.6 for the sale of books making a total of  98.15.11 so that all that is lacking is about fifty pounds. 
 printed matter matter in Maori that the  Deseret Sunday School Union have so  kindly consented and agread to furnish  us, we look for a still greater interest  to be taken and much more good  to be accomplished; Our day schools  are doing well, the Saints testify that  the children are learning much faster  then they do in the Government sch- ools.  It now become my painful  duty, to refer to that which  is not so pleasant, and I am  sure it will cause you feelings  of sorrow, as it had done my- self and Elder Wright.  I will inclose a letter wrote  by [redacted text] [redacted text] to President  Woodruff, which will in  part, explain it self, this was  wrote with the intention of  sending it direct, and wait 
 during the April Conference,  And felt greatly to rejoice in  the same. And will say, that  the brethren thus sustained  met with our hearty appr- oval and support, knowing  as we do know, that they  are the right men, in the  right place.  Your kind and inspiring  letter afforded us much ple- asure in reading the same, to  learn of your good health as also of your travels and labors  among the saints. As we  realiaze that they will result  in great good. It was most  gratifying to learn that Nephi  received a vissit from you, and  were premitted once more to  listen to your inspiring words  of council, and trust the  saints will receive them, 
 You will also be most gratified to note the in- crease of souls during the past year. From statisti- cal report inclosed you will see that 573 have been baptized and 230 children blessed, making a total of 743 which is an increase of 237 over and above the year pre- vious. There have also been two districts or conferences or- ganized and fifteen branches, also ^22^ Sunday Schools, which with the large sum of money raised for the printing of the Book of Mormon, and that important work having been nearly completed, we are filled with thanksgiving and praises unto the Lord our God; knowing as we do know, that it has all been accomplished by His divine guidance and wisdom, and as poor weak mortals we do not desire to take the least praise unto ourselves; ful- ly realizing that we have done no more than our duty. But by His aid and blessings we have sought to mgag- nify our most high and holy callings as embassa- dor of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, and fully real- ize that we have been wonderfully blessed and sustain- ed, having enjoyed the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.  It is also most gratifying to us to be able to state that the prospects for the future are very encouraging indeed, and by the aid that we feel that the Book of Mormon will begin aiding in the spreading of the Word of God, we feel that there will be a rich harvest of souls. Al- ready there have ^been^ over one hundred added to the fold 
 For an answer, but, after writ- ing the same, he laid the  sad affair before Angus. T.  Wright, the President of his dis- trict, and, handed him the  inclosed letter to read; he  at once forbade him acting  in any of the ordenances  of the Gospel, and partaking  of the Sacrement.  Upon inquiry, I learned that  he had first committed him- self with a married woman  about six years ago, who had  received her endowments.  After that, he repented for three  years, but, on reading, that  an adulturer could enter into  the Celestial Kingdom of God,  he became reckless, and let  his passions run wild with  him, up to within three 
 that they may be benefited  and blest thereby.  The course adopted by you in  appointing a committie to look  out a suitable location for the  Hawaiian saints to emigrate too. We think verry wise,  as we feel with you, that  what will be suitable for that  people, will also be adapted for  the Maoris.  We feel thankful for all your  councils, as also for all the  items of news.  Now dear brethren, in relation  to the appointing of me suc- cessor, I beg to state that I will  not take any action in the same  untill after the arrival of the  next mail, thinking that there  ^may^ be further instructions from  you, in answer to my letter  sent to you upon that subject. 
 months of him being call- ed upon this mission. Feeling that I had no right to handle his case here, and that we could not keep the natives from having sus- picions, seeing that he could not act in his calling, I have released him to return home by the  same Steamer that [has] this to you. And have counciled him to see one of the Apostles, and lay  before him his sad and painful affair.  I trust in this I have done right, as, I would much dislike the natives to learn the  nature of this case, has they now have every confidance in the servants of God, 
 but if no further word are  sent to us, we will appoint  and set apart the one you men- tioned in your letter.  And leave for our dear moun- tain home on the 12th of  August, the Lord willing,  and will be in S. L. City the  beginning of Sept, at which time  we hope to be favored  with the great prevelidge of  again beholding and greeting  our beloved President and his cou- nsolers, which thought insp- ires the soul as we now write,  for it seem an age since  we had that priveledge.  Elders H. J. Burgess and Aler  Bullock, two of the three,  for whom the  90 was  sent, will return with me,  Elder A. L. Stewart having  returned two months ago. 
 since the date of the report.  The Elders are all quite well and enjoy a most excellent spirit and are returning to their various districts feeling that this has been by far the best con- ference ever held in this mission. In their appoint- ments and ^our^ council meetings there was not a mur- mur or a dissenting voice, but all expressed them- selves as feeling assured that the Lord had directed in all things. Five of the six Elders that left in March for this field of labor arrived in safety, were in attendance at our conference, and have now been assigned to their fields of labor. I like their ap- pearance much, and think they are well adapted for this mission. One of their number, Elder Geo. T. Smith, returned from San Francisco on account of poor health. While speaking of the Elders still say that we feel blessed in having such a good faith- ful and obedient lot of boys, for such I call and claim them to be.  Much might be said of our conference, the large gathering, quantity of food consumed, kind- ness of those not in the church, etc. but as a full re- port will be furnished the Deseret News I will not take your valuable time by relating those items here: will simply say that the weather and all per- taining to the same was delightful. There was 
 nothing occurred to mar the peace and happiness of those present; but felt that we were in the enjoyment of the same Spirit that was with you in your con- ference.  You will please send a remittance of nine- ty pounds ( 90) on the Union Bank of Australia at Auckland for the return fares of Elders A. L. Stewart now laboring in Australia who has not enjoyed the best of health during the two years he has been here, and we do not think it best wise to keep him here over another of the wet winters of Australia as his lungs and kidneys seem affected. Alexander  Bullock who has been here two years, a good faith- ful man over fifty years of age. He has not been able to acquire the language, but has done all the good that laid in his power. And H. J. Burgess who has filled a faithful mission of 2 3/4 years. The two first named will most likely return in May, with a small company of Saints from Auckland. I will borrow the means for them, unless you have kindly responded to our last letter regarding the payment for the Book of Mormon. If so that can be used.  We have also directed Elder Wm Bromley to return home with Elder A. L. Stewart from Aust. feeling that it would not be best for him to remain here over winter in his advanced age, he being over seventy 
 to make up his return fare I have had to borrow  12-0-0 which he has agreed to refund as soon as he can. If the  Church could remit that  amount to me, and let  him pay them, I could then meet my obligations, and thus keep my credit good, as I frequently have to bor- row for these purposes.  We are now having  beautiful weather, and all nature is putting on her best attire; we have had a much more favorable winter, then the one previous.  We were rejoiced to learn of your good health, and sincerely desire and [pray] that the same may continue 
 Elders N. S. Bishop and J. W. Platt  will also return with me, as  they have been here three  years. For their return fares  as also for my own, I will  use  90 of the  100 you  so kindly loaned to us, for the for the final payment of the  printing of the Book of Mormon  in Maori.  Elder George Romney Jr  has also been here near three  years, and it will soon be  time for his release, so please  send a draft on the Union  Bank of Australia, at Auck -land, for  30 in favor  of Angus.

 years old. The understanding was that his brother, whom he went to see, would pay his return fare but not having heard from him I do not know how it will be.  There continues to be quite an enquiry among our dusky friends about their emigrating to Zion, feeling that they desire to get to the land of their forefathers when the Prophet and apostles and the holy temples are &c. We tell them to be patient, that this matter is before you, and in the due  time of the Lord the word will come for them to gather. This seems to satisfy them for a time, and then like children they will spring the same question again.  The hireling priest of the day, both European and Native, are becoming quite alarmed about us, the Elders, being in their midst; and at a conference just held at the Bay of Islands, at which there were three archbishops present, they got up a petition with many signatures, and sent to parliament asking for a law compell- ing us to return, ^or leave the island,^ and hindering any others from coming: setting forth that we are destroying the peace of the people; that before we came they were united in religious matters, but now we are causing them to leave the church of their

All these Elders mentioned  have preformed good faithful  missions, and return home in  honor, with my blessings,  and I feel with the blessings of  the Lord.  I thank you dear brethren  for you kind expressions  concerning my labors, in  sending my release.  I fully realiaze that I have  not done any more then my  duty, and prehaps not as  well as many others would  of done. Yet, I am led to praise  the Lord that I have been  inspired of Him to do as 
 I have, and that I am able  to see so much fruit of my  feeble efforts, I have sought  to be dilligent in traveling  and in raising my voice  in the defence of truth.  And I now rejoice that I can  return with the sanction and  blessings of my file leaders,  and I feel with the blessings  of the Lord.  It will be quite necessary to  have (6) six more Elders  sent to their field as soon  as possible, and if two of  the number, that has some  tact as school teachers, could  be sent, to take the place of  those now teaching school, it  would be splended, as they  are needed to travel, as soon  as they acquire the language, 
 fathers, that taught them to live in peace, quit eating each other &c. &c. Surely they feel that priestcraft is in danger. They are trying to stir up the people against us, but, thank God, all their desires fail and will continue to do so.  The tracts you so kindly sent, arrived safely and have been distributed to the various di- tricts, and we feel thankful that we can dis- tribute the printed word among the Europeans. But our experience among them forces this con- clusion upon our minds; viz. that there are but very few really honest in heart amongst them. Those that have been baptized into the church do not turn out well as a general rule. There is far more pleasure in laboring among the Maories with all their weaknesses and pecul- iarities.  During the conference it was thought best to hold two conferences each year one in the North and one in the South of the island because of the great distance to be traveled. Keeping ma^n^y away from being present, and notwith- standing the great expense of feeding such a gathering, they are all anxious to have it in their own districts.  We will take pleasure in sending a copy 
 We have had some splen -did conferences, at which a  rich portion of the spirit of  God has been enjoyed, by  both speaker and hearers.  and baptisms has taken  place ^at^ all of them.

Groesbeck, to labor on the South Island, to endeav- or to open up the work among the Maories of that is- land. A native brother who has lived there has also been appointed to accompany them.  All the Elders at the conference unite in send- ing profound love and blessings, and ever praying for the richest blessings of Heaven to be yours to enjoy, that you may ever be fully adequate for every circumstance which may arise, we remain Your Brother in the Gospel of Christ.

 I feel dear brethren that I  have abundent reasons to praise  the Lord our God, for the man-  nar He has blessed me with  health and strength, so that  I have been able to preform  all labors that has been  required of me. ^He^ has also  given unto me the con- fidance, love and esteem  of both my colaberers and  the saints.

Knowing as we do, that you are anxious to learn of the progress of the work of the Lord in all parts of the earth, and, so this is a grow- ing field as our time, when the harvest is being gathered, you would naturally have a deeper interest in hearing of the same.

We are thankful to state  that the work of the Lord  is opening up among our dusky friends upon the  South Island.  And that every thing is  prospering upon this Island.  With the happy thought  of soon having the great  prevelidge of meeting  you, we will not add  more at this time, only  to thank you for your  long and much appriciated

Knowing as we do that we are continually receiving blessings from His hands which alone qualify us for our many labors and duties. And if we did not have a testimony before coming here of the existence of a living Father in heaven and of the truthfulness of this work here from the earth, surely we have had many, yes, very many

 manifestations of His power in the healing of the sick, many of which have been healed instantaneously, the casting out of evil spirits, the breaking down of strong barriers, the preparing the minds of the people for the Gospel, the rais- ing up of friends to ad- minister unto us etc. All of which fill our hearts with joy and rejoices and make us feel, more than ever before, like doing all in our power to bless our fellow men, and establish upon the earth those correct principles that have been again revealed from the Eternal world for the salvation of the children of men. Realizing at the same 
 rejoice both at home and abroad.  While you were, with the many Saints rejoic- ing in conference in Salt Lake City, we also were  rejoicing in our annual ^conference^ which has just closed at  this place, and at which were in attendance  thirty one of the Elders from Zion, as also a large at- tendance of our dusky friends from all the districts,  except that of Tauranga. Great were the rejoicings  of all present, as the spirit of God was so abundantly  ^bestowed^ upon both speakers and hearers, and many were  the words of inspiration that were spoken during  the five days that we were together, two of which  were occupied by the Elders in council, in which we  were one, and all melted to tears of joy, so great  was the spirit of God that was in our midst causing  each one to arise to his feet and praise the living God:  for we ^were^ enabled by the power of his Holy Spirit to testify  [t]hat He is our Father and that we are His delegated  sons, the embassadors of our Lord Jesus Christ. Every  slelfish feeling that might have been in our hearts  was swallowed up in the love of God, and we were  led to rejoice much that our lot has been cast upon  this island to labor among this benighted and sinful  people, a portion of the House of Israel. They have  such faith in a Supreme being, as also in the bBible,  that many of them are led to receive the truths of 
 time how very weak we are, and the necessity of leaning upon the Lord for strength, wisdom and qualification necessary for us.  Your esteemed favors of Aug- ust 20th and Sept 17th came duly to hand and were read with the  usual deep pleasure and interest We were caused to rejoice to learn of the good health pre- vailing in your midst and the desires of our hearts are that you may continue on the enjoyment of the same blessings.  It was indeed a great surprise to us to learn of Our Beloved Brother George Q. Cannon giving himself up to the Gov- ernment officials and still more 
 the Gospel soon as they hear them, for they see that they are  precisely the same as taught by Christ and His apostles.  And many, very many others would receive the  same if it were not for the power exercised by the  chiefs ofver the various tribes. This power however  will sooner or later be broken down so that every hon- est soul may rejoice in the truth. We see a great change  in this respect in ^during^ the past three years, for wherever  the Gospel is received, it does away to a great extent  with their feelings of chiefship, or desires to keep  others in subjection. This was quite marked dur- ing our conference, as we had quite a number of  leading chiefs in attendance, yet they were humble  as children, and one with the Saints in all things.  And we were also made to rejoice in beholding the  great improvement the Saints are making in know- ledge and faith in the Gospel, as also their personal  appearance and deportment, and willingness to  hearken unto counsel.  One of the leading features of the conference  and one that gave great joy unto the Saints, was hav- ing five hundred copies of the Book of Mormon in  Maori, to distribute amongst them. Never were chil- dren more anxious to receive their Christmas pres- ents, then were this people to receive that holy book.  And although nearly all present had paid from five 
 so to hear of the lightness of his sentence. No wonder at the rabid element getting more than mad. We sincerely hope that they will not be able to trump up any other charge against him, so as to retain him in their power. For we feel with you that he with the leaders  of Israel, are needed much to labor in the midst of the people and give unto the Saints the word of the Lord, guiding and directing them in the  path they ought to walk How gladly the Saints will re- ceive their words of council and instruction after having been for such a long time excluded from their midst. We feel that 
 shillings (the price of a book) to five pounds and upwards,  and were entitled to receive copies without any fur- ther payments, yet so great what is their joy, that  about eighty paid for their books five shillings each  saying that they had joy in so doing, as it was their  desire to assist in raising the balance yet due on the  final payment that there might be a fund on hand  for the publishing of other works, as they desire to  receive all that God has revealed for the guidance  and blessing of His children. When I was set  apart for this mission, among other great promises  and blessings that were pronounced upon me, was  that means necessary to carry on this work should  be raised in a mysterious manner, and surely this  has been the case from the commencement until this  time, for most of the means have come in quite a mys- terious manner, and as the payments have become  due just enough to pay them, has been forthcoming,  and for the last payment, the Saints have exceeded  our most sanguine hopes or expectations. With this  a statement will be furnished showing the receipt and disbursements in balance on hand which I feel  will be most gratifying, for beside the balance of   80-12-5, we have collected  18-3-6 for the sale of books  making a total of  98-15-11 so that all that is lacking  is about fifty pounds. 
 You will also be most gratified to note the in- crease of souls during the past year. From statisti- cal report inclosed you will see that 513 have been  baptized and 230 children blessed, making a total of 743  which is an increase of 237 over and above the year pre- vious. There have also been two districts or conferences or- ganized and fifteen branches, also ^22^ Sunday Schools; which  with the large sum of money raised for the printing of  the Book of Mormon, and that important work having  been nearly completed, we are filled with thanks giving  and praises unto the Lord our God; knowing as we do  know, that it has all been accomplished by His divine  guidance and wisdom, and as poor weak mortals we  do not desire to take the least praise unto ourselves; ful- ly realizing that we have done no more than our duty.  But by His aid and blessings, we have sought to mgag- nify our most high and holy callings as embassa- dors of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, and fully real- ize that we have been wonderfully blessed and sustain- ed, having enjoyed the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.  It is also most gratifying to us to be able to state  that the prospects for the future are very encouraging  indeed, and by the aid that we feel the Book of Mormon  will be in aiding in the spreading of the Word of God,  we feel that there will be a rich harvest of souls. Al- ready there have ^been^ over one hundred added to the fold 
 we would gladly travel many miles to have the blessed privilege of seeing and hearing the Apostles of Christ.  The Elders mentioned by you arrived at Auckland on the 10th inst in the enjoyment of health having had a pleasant voyage save the first day out from San Francisco, which was quite rough. Father Bromley looks quite aged and feeble for such a long journey. Yet he was feeling as well as could be expected. They were appointed to labor as fol- lows: John H. Timpson, Waikato; Latimus O. Taft, Poverty Bay; Hugh S Geddes, Mahia; Joseph P. Beck, Hawkes Bay; We like their appearance much 
 and feel that they will make good missionaries. Elder Geo E. Woolley felt some what cast down, on parting, with his brethren to continue his journey to Australia. Judging from the short time I spent with him, I think him a fine young man and speak for him a useful life through humility.  By some means the Elders did not bring the tracts you stated would be sent to us. We sincerely hope they will come by the Elders now on their way here. It was very gratify- ing to receive instructions concern- ing the emigration of the "Maories" For we have written three times on the same subject without 
 since the date of the report.  The Elders are all quite well and enjoy a most  excellent spirit and are returning to their various  districts feeling that this has been by far the best con- ference ever held in this mission. In their appoint- ments and ^our^ council meetings, there was not a mur- mur, or a dissenting voice, but all expressed them- selves as feeling assured that the Lord had directed  in all things. Five of the six Elders that left in  March for this field of labor arrived in safety, were  in attendance at our conference, and have now  been assigned to their fields of labor. I like their ap- pearance much, and think they are well adapted  for this mission. One of their number, Elder Geo. T. Smith, returned from San Francisco on account of  poor health. While speaking of the Elders Iwill say  that we feel blessed in having such a good faith- ful and obedient lot of boys, for such I call and  claim them to be.  Much might be said of our conference, the  large gathering, quantity of food consumed, kind- ness of those not in the church, etc. but, as a full re- port will be furnished the Deseret News I will not  take your valuable time by relating those items  here: will simply say that the weather and all per- taining to the same was delightful. There was 
 nothing occurred to mar the peace and happiness of  those present; but felt that we were in the enjoyment  of the same Spirit that was with you in your con- ference.  You will please send a remittance of nine- ty pounds ( 90)on the Union Bank of Australia  at Auckland for the return fares of Elders A. L.  Stewart now laboring in Australia, who has not  enjoyed the best of health during the two years he  has been here, and we do not think it best wise to keep  him here over another of the wet winters of Australia  as his lungs and kidneys seem affected. Alexander  Bullock, who has been here two years, a good faith- ful man, over fifty years of age. He has not been  able to acquire the language, but has done all the  good that laid in his power. And H. J. Burgess who  has filled a faithful mission of 2 3/4 years. The  two first named will most likely return in May, with  a small company of Saints from Auckland. I will  borrow the means for them, unless you have kindly  responded to our last letter regarding the payment  for the Book of Mormon. If so that can be used.   We have also directed Elder Wm Bromley to return  home with Elder A. L. Stewart from Aust[ralia]. feeling that  it would not be best for him to remain here over  winter in his advanced age, he being over seventy 
 receiving any word until now. We did not know what answer to give to those so anxious to gather. But now, we feel that they will be quite reconciled for a time, to wait until that suitable place is selected for them. We will pre- sent it to them in the best light possible. We are sorry to have to report another case of hostility. This time it was with the native Saints and not the Elders. Yet it occured at the same place that Elders Johnson and Magleby were tied up and kept prisoners for two days. The chief and some of the leading men at this village are very bitter enemies to the Church. And recently some of his people 
 years old. The understanding was that his brother,  whom he went to see, would pay his return fare;  but, not having heard from him I do not know  how it will be.  There continues to be quite an enquiry among  our dusky friends about their emigrating to Zion,  feeling that they desire to get to the land of their  forefathers where the Prophet and Apostles and the  holy temples are, &c. We tell them to be patient,  that this matter is before you, and in the due  time of the Lord, the word will come for them to  gather. This seems to satisfy them for a time, and  then like children they will spring the same question  again.  The hireling priest of the day, both European  and Native, are becoming quite alarmed about  us, the Elders, being in their midst: and at a  conference just held at the Bay of Islands, at  which there were three archbishops present, they  got up a petition with many signatures, and  sent to parliament asking for a law compell- ing us to return, ^or leave the islands,^ and hindering any others from  coming: setting forth that we are destroying the  peace of the people; that before we came they  were united in religious matters, but now  we are causing them to leave the church of their 
 became convinced of the truth of the Gospel and embranced the same. This was done during a visit to other parts. So when they returned to their homes some of the people, led on by the chief and a hirelying priest, commenced  to affect them to endeavour to  get them to leave the church Among other things they tied brother and his wife up for two days and nights. Also badly whipped, knocked down and kicked another brother and but for being afraid of the laws of the lands no doubt would have killed them. The guilty parties were summoned before Judge Booth but did not receive their just  dues, as he, the Judge, is a 
 fathers, that taught them to live in peace, quit  eating each other &c. &c. Surely they feel that  priestcraft is in danger. They are trying to  stir pup the people against us, but, thank God, all  their desires fail, and will continue to do so.  The tracts you so friendly sent, arrived safely  and have been distributed to the various dis tricts, and we feel thankful that we can dis- tribute the printed word among the Europeans,  but our experience among them forces, this con- clusion upon our minds; viz that there are  but very few really honest and heart amongst  them. Those that have been baptized into the church  do not turn out well as a general rule. There  is far more pleasure in laboring among the  Maories with all their weaknesses and pecul- iarities.  During the conference it was thought best  to hold two conferences each year, one in the  North and one in the South of the island because  of the great distance to be traveled. Keeping  ma^n^y away from being present, and notwith- standing the great expense of feeding such  a gathering, they are all anxious to have it in  their own districts.  We will take pleasure in sending a copy 
 member of the Church of England and a friend to the minister. But on word being sent to Well- ington, the Government seat, con- cerning their proceedings we were instructed to take the next case to the higher court, with a promise that we should receive justice as they approved of our labours among the natives. For we are teaching them to keep the laws of the land etc. We, therefore, do not look for another occurrence of that kind, at least at the same place.  It is with hearts filled with thanksgivings and praises unto our Heavenly Father, that we report to you the condition of this important mission. For we realize 
 of the Book of Mormon by the first returning  Elders.  Having now sufficient Elders we have direct- ed two from this conference, Elders N. S. Bishop and Jos S. Groesbeck, to labor on the South Island, to endeav- or to open up the work amoung the Maories of that is- land. A native brother who has lived there has also been appointed to accompany them.  All the Elders at the conference unite in send- ing profound love and blessings, and ever praying for the richest blessings of Heaven to be yours to enjoy, that you may ever be fully adequate for every circumstance which may arise, we remain Your Brother in the Gospel of Christ.  Wm Paxman 
 that it is through the blessings of God, and the ernest efforts of my co-labourers, that we are enabled to make such a favorable and good report. In this the Bay of Islands District, in which I am now laboring and will be, the Lord willing, for some time yet, there has been one hundred and twenty five added to the Church during the past six weeks, and the prospects are most encourag- ing for many more to come  forth and enter into the Church of Christ through the door of baptism, in the near future.  Very favorable reports reach me from all the Districts and more or less are being added to the Church. In Australia the Elders 
 meet with a great amount of opposition to encounter. And there seem to be very few that care an iota about religion. They are more lovers of pleasures than lovers of God, their lives being the riches of the world. Still the Elders labors with great diligence and are doing all that lies in their power to warn the people. Sister Armstrong and family of five children, emigrated by the last mail steamer from that place. This makes it still worse for the Elders, as that was their best and almost only home. We have had five thous- and tracts printed entitled, "Good tidings or the New and Everlasting Gospel" by Jos. F. Smith for 
 that part and the Europeans upon these Islands. So with the tracts you are sending us we will be better prepared to warn the people and find the few honest in heart  The health of the Elders is good, as far as I now know. And there is general goods health prevailing among the Saints. As was expected Elders H. J. Man ning and M. S. Marriott wife and child and Sister Katie left for home by the last mail steamer, as also  a young sister, Charlotte Rowntree, and the six mentioned from  Sydney. Elder Manning was ap- pointed to take charge of the company. They return with Hon -orable Releases having performed faithful missions 
 Te Hauke, Hawks Bay New Zealand, July 3, 1888  President Wilford Woodruff and Quorum of Apostles;  Dear and beloved Brethren: Once more through the loving kindness of our Heaven- ly Father we are permitted to address you by letter, in answer to your most welcome and highly appreciated fa- vor of the 24th of May, which reached us on the 30th of June, since which time it has been read and re-read  with increased interest and joy, for we need not state that our hearts were made to swell within us with rejoic- ings, and praises unto the Lord our God to know that another Temple had been dedicated unto the Most high God, and made holy by His presence and acceptance,  and by the rich out pouring of His Holy Spirit to fill every part thereof even to the rejoicing of all that were permitted to enter its sacred portals, many of whom,  I feel assured, heard and saw the marked manifestations of Gods approval and acceptance of so beautiful an offering from His covenant children. Your discription of its elegance and beauty of finish, making it so grand and pleasing to the eye, was very gratifying indeed.  We could not helpp feeling in our hearts, Oh, that we might have been present to have partaken of those blessed privilages, yet, feeling at the same time, that 
 As we may not be able to write to you for some time, and in order to give you time, will here state, that we would like to have four or five Elders for this Mission arrive in Auckland in March next. The steamer will leave San Francisco about the 8th of March.  Elders J. E. Magleby and J. W. Kau- leinamoku, have now been here about three years and four months Therefore it will be right for them to return home in early Spring. They have filled most ex- cellent missions. So please send the means for their return fares on the Union Bank of Australia at Auckland.  We were much gratified to 
 we are just where Father wants us to be; therefore we are reconciled to labor with our might to bless this branch of the house of Israel. And we unite with you in the prayer that the Mighty One will ever preserve it from the hands of the wicked and the defilement of the unclean,  that it may continue a house holy unto the Lord, in  which the Saints may receive their blessings, & labor for the redemption of their dead.  Surely this will be an aditional strength to the Saints,  in which we will have greater power with the heavens; God grant that it may be so.  How rejoiced we were to learn of your brief stay in Juab Stake, and that we had a son that was worthy of your confidence and had the privilage of an inter- view with you; we had expressed a wish that you might have the privilage of dedicating the Temple before it was open to the public.  The account given of the actions of the Receiver is not so pleasing; they produce feelings of another kind for we see in his actions the strong determination of Satan to destroy the church of Christ, and afflict in every possible way the saints of the Most High, and feel if he can stop the glorious labor that is now being done in the Holy Temples, he will have gained a great  victory.  Earnest prayers are being offered up in this the nethermost part of the earth, for the Lord to preserve those holy buildings from falling into the hands of our enemies yet, at the same time we fully realize that all is in 
 the hands of the Lord, and that he will control all things for the best, for, as you sayo beautifully say, come what  will, it will not destroy the fact of revelation or the Gospel being restored, and if we are faithful to them no power can seperate us from the love of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ.  By the same mail that brought your letter we learn with deep regret of the death of our beloved brother Apostle Erastes Snow. Another noble spirit has gone to join with our illustrious prophets, apostles, patriarchs, and saints that have gone before, to intercede with the heavenly hosts in the behalf of the saints left behind.  The seven Elders mentioned by you, arrived at Auckland in safety on the 23 of June, feeling well in spirits, and have been assigned to their fields of labor as follows:  Jas. S. Nye, Hawks Bay; R. Gibbons, Poverty Bay;  Walter S. Reid, Bay of Islands; Jos. S. Dame, Waikoto;  Jos. N. Haywood, Mahia; John S. Bingham, Waiapi; and Thos. C. Young, Hauraka districts, the last three to teach school, and in a short time Elder Reid will also teach school in the Bay of Islands.  In relation to our day-schools, we will here state that we are careful not to organize them, only in such parts where there are no Government schools within reach of the child- dren, and where there are a number of children growing up in ignorance, for we see it will be a labor to keep them up; however, it affords the Elders this teaching, an opportunity of acquiring the language, and fitting them for the 
 learn of the success of the work of the Lord upon the Samoan Islands and trust that the interest may continue.  Also very thankful to know that the new judges are acting with more justice and consideration to- wards the Saints. And do sin- cerely trust that the same spirit may continue to be mani- fested. We learn from the papers that the Supreme Court of the Territory has decided against us in the property suit. That is as good as we could naturally expect from that body. But we sincerely hope that that ^the^ Supreme Court of the  U States may have eyes to see and ears to hear, that justice may be done. We are well in health 
 and feeling splendid in our labors and desire to do all that lies in our power to further the pur- poses of God on this part of God's vineyard. The printing of the Book of Mormon is progressing nicely. We desire to have it completed by our April Conference. Though the means is coming in rather slowly at present.  Ever praying for the choicest blessings of God our Eternal Father to be yours. That you may be adaquate to every emergency With profound and sincere love in Which Elders Geo Romney Jr. and E. Mangleby, who I am now with, join. I am now as ever  Your Brother in the Gospel of Christ. Wm Paxman 
 Elders for this mission, if it could be arranged for them to leave San Francisco by the steamer that sails from there on the 17 of October. I could meet them  on their arrival at Auckland, as, the Lord willing,  I will be there at that time on my way to the Bay of Islands, the extreme north end of the Island: if two or three of that number had an aptitude to teach school we would be thankful.  We are now extending our labors more among the Eu- ropeans, than we have done before, and by the blessings of the Lord there has been quite a few baptized, but we labor unde[r] a disadvantage in not having a suply of tracts for them, and, having the publishing of Book of Mormon on hand, we dare not ask for means out side of that. The Tithing that comes in is but very small, hardly suffic- ient to meet the small current expenses. If some of our brethren that have made fortunes in a day, by selling their inheritences, could be induced to send out a few thous- and tracts, treating on the first principles of the Gospel etc., we could make excellant use of them, and they would thereby be preaching the Gospel by the printed word; the tracts could be sent by the coming Elders without any expense.  Since our last letter to you, gratifying words have reached us from the Mahia, Hauraka and Bay of Island  districts of the aditions to the Church by baptism, there have also been aditions in this the Hawks Bay district of both Europeans & natives, and the prospects for the fu- 
 c/o James Hay, Cobden Street Newton, Auckland, New Zealand. May 8th 1889  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear and much beloved Brother.  We are just in receipt of your most esteemed favor of the 1st of April, which was read and reread with deep interes,.  And we feel greatly blest to receive so much of your attention and kind consideration, and was indeed blest in our feelings to learn of the good health of yourself and those of the Apostles. As also to learn of the prosperety and welfare of Zion in all of her department. It was most gratifying to learn of the grand success of the Church Schools now organized, as also of the bright prospects of others being started in the near future.  We feel assured that you had a glorious time during your conference, and we sincerely hope that among the "important items of buisness transadid" that the First Presidency was organized, as we feel that the Church is much stronger with all her quorums fully organized, and how blest we as saints are, for your life having been preserved upon the earth to direct the affairs of God upon His foot stool, having been so familiar with the Church of Christ from 
 the beginning, Surely the Lord has had a purpose in thus preserving you with all your mental and physicial faculties to such a ripe age.  And may God's choice blessings ever be with you and those associated with you, is the many earnest prayers that are offered up by our dusky friends, as also the Elders.  We with you sincerely desire that our en- emies will not prevail with Prest Harrison in getting our most bitter enemies appoin- ted to fill the various offices of the Territory.  We are indeed verry grateful for your kin- dness in loaning the $500, asked for, that we might be able to meet our obligations incured in the printing of the 2,000 copies of the Book of Mormon in Maori: and feel exceedingly thankful for the same.  And we are truly happy to be able to state that we are in a possition so that we will not need to use more then $200 of the amount sent, as we stated in our letter sent to you by the last mail. So if you have not sent the  90 - asked for, on the recept of this, please do not send only  30 and credit us with the $300, and the Lord willing it will be but a short time before we will be able to refund the remaining $200, as the Natives are 
 future look fully as favorable as at any time in the past; for, although the ministers of the various churches are doing all that lay in their power against the work of God among our dusky friends, calling their chiefs together to poisen their minds etc., they do not succeed as they would like, for they generally find some of our Elders or Saints to rebut their statements and stand up in our favor, giving the  natives a chance to see the differance between p Priesthood and Priestcraft, and in many cases doing more good than harm, for they overstep all bounds of reason, and tell such barefaced falshoods that even the natives can de- tect them.  On my return from the South, I found Elder S. Sanders and Sister Katie in the enjoyment of health, and about fin- ishing the writing of the MSS, ready for the reading before our Maori brethren, as soon as they can get there.  Elder Marriott wrote me a few days ago asking if there would be any objections of one of our Native Sisters emigrating to Zion, the only objection I see in the way is, that others will desire to follow in the same way, for it will not do to extend to one any liberties that cannot be given to all as they are so peculiar in this respect, so much like children we have to be exceedingly careful in every movement we make with them, and with their limited experience in the Gospel, and their natural desire to im- itate after the evils. Fears are entertained by us that some of them might partake of the bad element of our once peaceful cities and report back the amount 
 anxious to get the books to read, and in a few days we will have another 500 copies ready for sale.  We have indeed been blest in this labor.  Now dear President, regarding  your enquiries. "Have you any suitable Elder or Elders now with you whom you can recommend to succeed you when you are released to return home, or do you think it will be necessary or desirable that some Elder specially called to preside in Australasia be sent from here?"  We will here state, that we have two Elders that in my judgment would be suitable to fill this possition, namely Angus. T. Wright of Ogden, who has been here 1 1/2 years.  And J. S. Bingham of Clifton, Ida- ho, who is a counciler to the Bishop of that Ward, he has been here one year the 23rd of next month, they are both good men, and wou- ld do all that laid in their power to further the work of God in this land.  I fear how- ever that the first named would not be able to endure so much horse back riding as is required of the president of this mission, as he is enclined to be stout and riding to much on horse back seem to hurt him.  At our anual conference, last month, they were both appointed to preside over verry important districts, those that had 
 of wrong doing there is in the midst of the saints,  such as drinking, smoking, swearing, Sabbath- breaking etc., which would spread from one end of the Island to the other, thereby doing much harm.  It might be well to here state that our dusky friends are exceedingly fond of all sports and ammusements, such  as horse races, billiards, foot ball, foot-races, etc., and it would not require but a small exertion on their part to follow after all such things. Our feelings are that when they emigrate, there should be a suitable location for them to gather to, that they might be together, as all their work now is done on the United order principle; they will not work, live, eat or sleep alone, and they are not ever fond of work, but if properly directed they can do a great deal of work. Having thus given our feelings in brief, we will be pleased to receive and carry out any suggestions or instructions you may deem best to give on this matter.  There is general good health prevailing in the midst of the saints, there has been no time since our arrival here that the saints have been so free from sickness.  The health of the E[l]ders and Sisters is also good, for which we feel exceedingly thankful to our Heavenly Father.  We were rejoiced to learn of your good health and have a great desire that it may so continue, for we see to a limited extent the great labors that are upon you in these very trying times as also the intense anxiety. Earnest, yet humble prayers are con 
 been somewhat neglected for the want of suitable Elders to preside over them.  And if eith- er of them were called, we would not know just how to fill up the vacency and do justice to the district, yet, if you are led to appoint one of them we could get along some how, but, if a good wise fatherly Elder could be sent from home, it might be good, as it would give him a longer time to preside, and leave these districts mentioned in a better condition.  This mission is quite large and is still growing.  It now take about a year to go over the same, attending conferences, etc.   We have a great desire, and feel sure that the ^right^ one will be appointed, for this is a verry peculiar people to handle, and by the blessings of the Lord we now have their love and confidance.  Elder A. L. Stewart, will return home with a small company of European saints, by the steamer that bring this to you, he is a good faithful worker and have prefor- med a good mission of two years; the last one being in Australia.  With him I will send copies of the Book of Mormon in Mauri for yourself and Prests George Q Cannon and Jos. F. Smith. 
 stantly assending unto the Lord our God from the Elders and Saints. Many times our hearts are made glad at listening to the earnest appeals to the Throne of Grace, made by our dusky breth- ren and Sisters, and we feel that the Lord will hear them, because of their child like simplicity.

 realiazing that you would like to see them, and prehaps may come in useful for some of your sons.  Since receiving your letter we have made arrangements for holding conferences in five of the districts, which will occopy my time untill the last of July.  Since the last writing there has been quite a few added to the Church by baptism, and the future look quite bright before us.  We are quite anxious to receive the con- ference news that we may be kept posted, and be strengthened there by.  As we wrote you at length a month ago; we will not add more at this time, only to say that the health of my self and colabor- ers is good, and our spirits cheerful and bright. The health of the saints is also generally good.  Praying God to abundently bless you and all those associated with you with every needed gift and grace,  and with love,  We remain your Brother and Friend, in the cause of truth and righteouness.

 two of our clerks have left us; Bro. Grimshaw cannot stand Mormonism any longer or the hard times, and he has left for  England on his own hook, and Bro Bullock has been called by President Young to go on a Mission to England, so there  are none now, but Leo, Robert and myself, but we shall do the  best we can. We have got through with the history of Joseph up  to his death, unless you give us something more in answer to  the letter we sent you by the last mail, to fill up some blanks &c.  We shall next commence upon the History of Brigham Young &c.  There is nothing very strange with us, all is peace and quietness  with us while the strom is raging in the lower world, the only thing we  have heard of late to create any excitement at all, and that but little  was that Troskalawski one of the U. S. Surveying party had been  damning the people and boys, and calling them, in the streets anything he could think of. One evening while calling the two Mechams "God damned Mormon sons of Bitches" they pitched him down into the ditch and gave him a thrashing, and it has been said that Gen. Burr was going to leave in consquence of it but it has not made much stir.  Your family are well, as is the case with the families of  all the brethren who are there. We are going a head with the  Agricultural and Manufacturing interest; the Hands are taking the matter up, in this city, and becoming Auxiliary branches of the Society, and are going into the Manufacturing  business as far as possible, we have it to do, as the money  is nearly all gone out of the Territory. There is a general  council and feeling through this Territory to retrench our expenses at the Stores and make all that we have to use, as far as we can. 
 President Young is extending his high stone wall around  all around his Mansion and garden. President Kimball has built a fine granary with cobble stones laid in cement and his extending his wall all around his premises.  The New Historians Office is progressing finely; the  plasterers last night finished their work on it, it will  soon be ready for us to go into.  I hope we shall hear from you often.  We wish to be remembered to you.  As Ever, I remain Yours truly,  W Woodruff 
 Br Woodruff said that his health was not good said that the Lord saw that the longer we remained in sin the harder it would be for us to get rid of our sins, we would never find as good A time to get rid of our sins as the present said that we could not hide them from the Lord and that we should confess and [adore] and spoke on the subject of the Gentiles that are in our midst that he did not care much about  them and gave some good instruction.

My Dear Brethren:  Your very welcome  favors of Mar. 4th adnd 23rd  reached me by same mail. They were read with  much intreerest and we,  who heard them, felt  strengthened in our desires  and labors among this  people, and your kind  encourgaging words made  us felel thankful that we  were counted worthy to  labor in the service of God,  and could have the con- fidence of His most honored

My Dearly beloved Bretheren:  Your ever welcome letter  of Jany 8th came duly to hand and  as usual we were much pleased  to receive your valued instruc- tions, and feel to press forward  with renewed dilligence after pe- rusing the same.  We fully realize the great  responsibility resting upon you  during these very peculiar and  distressing times, but know that  God is able to make you equal to  every emergency. We have eager- ly scanned the newspapers on  the arrival of our mails to learn  if possible the decision on pend- ing cases. We really have no fear 
 servants and highly favored  mouth pieces.  I am pleased to report  that five Elders reached here in safety, enjoying good  health, and having had  a very pleasant voyage. One of them, Bro. A. L.  Young was selected to con- tinue on to Australia, to  labor under the direction of  Elder Geo E. Woolly who  now has charge of that field  of labor. The balance of  the company were appointed  to various fields on this  Island.  While on this subject I wish  to enquire what to do in the  case of Bro. William Bromley, who is now laboring in 
 for the final outcome of the cause  of God, but we certainly would  like to see our rights respected  more, and ^the^ spirit of the law ad- ministered with more equity  and justice.  We are now anxioulsly a waiting to hear the results of the  City election.  Having had an unpleasant  experience with our unscrupu- lous opponents we cannot help  having grave fears that they  may have worked their nefar- ious schemes there and gained  the day.  We enclose with this the six  months report, also one for the  past year and trust they will  reach you in time for the general  conference.  As our labors and conferences

I was informed that the  mission was his own  choice, and got the impres- sion that he would return  at his pleasure, and con- sequently, with his own  means. When I met Pres. Chipman he made en- quiries respecting him which  leaves me in doubt.  He also stated that the  old gentleman was failing  quite fast, and should be  released as he would be

Our re- ports will show how the cause is  moving. While they are not com ing in so fast as formally, yet  those who receive the Truth now,  have considered longer, under- stand its requirements better,  and should be stronger to with- stand the weaknesses of the flesh  to which they in particular seem  subject.

 better off among friends at  home.  There will probably be no  Elders returning though  before October, and I don't  think it advisable for the  old gentleman to undertake  the journey alone. There is  a prospect of having another  small company of emigrating  Saints by that time.  In your latest communi- cation, you speak as though  there may be some elders  following. I will be very  glad indeed to get them, or  at least two more which  will make up the number  I asked for, and fill existing  vacancies.  I find it ne^ce^ssary to keep

 up the full compliment of  Elders, in order to have qualified  speakers to take charge of dis- tricts.  In my communication of  March 19th, I recommended  that four new Elders be  notifed forto this field to arrive  here in Sept., or Oct. Please  notify five instead of four, to reach here at the time  stated.  We have started again  on our tour of inspection or  visits among the various  districts of the mission, and  thus far have found the  Saints feeling well in the  Gospel, and no more than  the usual amount of  troubles to settle. 
 As the winter rains have  begun, and earlier too than  usual, traveling is made  disagreeable and in some  parts impossible on account  of the heavy floods which  are quite common to the  country.  We continue to enjoy  good health, as do all of  the Elders, and nothing  more serious than an occasional  attack of the Gripps, or slight  cold has troubled any of us  for some time. Were we  not satisfied that the prayers  of our dear ones and the  Saints generally are heard  by our Heavenly Father and that we are preserved  by Him, it would seem 
 almost miraculous the way  in which we are enable  to stand the inconveniences  of the Mission and the  changeableness of this climate.  Praying for the success  of Zion and the health  and prosperity of her inspired  leaders, I am your obedient  servant,  Angus T. Wright.  Address; c/o E. Turner, Edinburgh St. Newton, Auckland.

 dear and delicate sisters. I was as much suprized as I was pained to hear of the accusation against brother Taft, for I had labored with ed him for some months, and had not only formed an attachment for him, but always considered him a faithful and energetic young man. I received a telegram from him the same day I did your letter, stating he had trouble at home would leave on first steamer and inqired about money for his  passage, as I could not follow your instructions implicitly, to have him come to see me - on account of distance and lack of time, I wired him 
 telling him you had reported his case to me and if he was guilty I was to send him home. He answerd back that he is guilty, or to use his own words, that the report is correct, and he would leave the next day for Auckland I directed a letter containing a check for 25 pou- nds, to him, at Auckland, stat- ing also that I had no aut- hority to pay the fares of  Elders returning under such circumstance that he must arrange that matter with you.  Elder John A Sutton Jr., Ezra  Stevenson, David Muir, Geo. W. Davis Boyd Stewart, and Stephen D Chipman, with a 
 small company of Saints will Sail April 21st for Zion. I have no half-fare R. R. permits for them if they are obtainable please mail them to John A Sutton Jr., General Post Office, Sanfrancisco; these  Elders have all filled full and faithful missions,  and can return home rej- ocing. Elder John T. Smellie has decided to spend the rema- inder of his mission here and not return by Europe as arranged for.  I have paid Elder Taft 25 pounds of the Thirty sent for him.

I take the liberty of  giving him this letter of intro- duction to you, as he has been  faithfully laboring here for the  past three years, and being  thoroughly conversant with the  mission, can perhaps give you  a better idea of it in a short  conversation, then I possibly

My Dearly Beloved Bretheren:  We were very much pleased  indeed to receive your kind and  interesting epistle of the 11 ult. and will endeavor to put your  [v]aluable instructions into prac- tice.  We can fully indorse your  remarks in which you say that  opposition is preferable to apathy,  having recently experienced the  former, and in consequence had  several European additions in  a part where a minister had been  lecturing against us.  We are pleased to hear that  we may expect two more mis-
