April 7th 1861 In the afternoon President Brigham Young spoke to the people in the spirit and power of God upon Principle He spoke upon the subject of the Patriarchal Marriage He said if a man took more than one FIGURE wife upon the principle of passion instead of principle it will prove  a curse instead of a Blessing if a woman is sealed to a good man  she should be satisfied and attend to her own business and let her husband  alone and not be watching him all the time. Women are sealed to men to bring forth children and not to gratify passion and much was said upon this subject when he closed, He called upon Capt Jefferson Hunt to  speak He made a good deal of music for the people. I met with the all the Presidency and L Snow and W Woodruff of the Twelve in the Prayer Circle. L. Snow Prayed and G A Smith was Mouth at  the close of Prayers Joseph A. Young came into the room and informed President Young that what remains could be found of George A Smith jr had Just arived by Jacob Hamblin consisting of a part of the scull ^and^ thigh  bones, they were brought into George A. Smiths House Before leaving the circle room President Young said I want to say a few words to Brother  Orson Hyde At the opening of this general Conference I was there one minute before the time, and Brother Hyde had opened the Conference  had prayers and singing and I must say I was mortified I am the president of the whole Church and it is my place to preside at a general  Conference. did you ever know me to step foreward in the days of Joseph and take his place and open a General Conference without he directed me  to do it, or did you ever know me interfere with the rights of any  man No you have not. I should have waited an hour after the  time before I should have opened the Conference but Brother Hyde opened it before the time and he has served me the same several  times and I dont want to see it any more. Elder Orson Hiyde said it never Entered my heart that I was doing wrong several who were president present said it was 10 oclok and asked me to open the Conference  and I ownly done it to open the way for you. Brother George asked me this Noon to open the Conference and I told him No for I had heard that  you was not pleased about it G A Smith said I did ask him and it  did not Enter into my heart but what all was right. Brother Hyde  said He would remember it for the future, I do not think any one of the Twelve thought of it. President Young said Now I will   ENDENTRY April 7, 1861 ask all of you, how would you feel if you had a work to do which God and the heavens held you responsible for and just as you was about to step forth to do it another man should rise up and take it out of your hands Before the people as though you was not qualifyed to Do it orand was neg- lecting your duty you would not like it you would feel schagrined  and so did I. Now we can see by this how easy it is for a man  to walk into a mud hole when they think they are walking on solid ground then let us all profit by this example and be careful that we do not  interfere with the rights of others.

President Brigham Young in his instructions to the missionaries said now I want you to remember what I say to you, now take care that you do not get to sleep and let the devil take the advantage of you. You may do that in an hour that you cannot rega- in through all Eternity.

We have the privilege of living to all Eternity and Enjoying Eternal life forever, while the wicked want  to kill his Neighbor. Now I want to say to you all quit your covetous- ness, and whether you have little or much give it to bring the poor to Zion and let the women alone, or it will prove a curse to you Here is George Grant has no wife now let him not think of a wife untill He gets back, this corting women while you are abroad upon a mission is a miserable business, I would not give shucks for an Elder who cannot go on a mission and keep clean and come back clean. now remember that.

In speaking of the Young said the North would  find much treachery among there armies Anderson is playing a a deep game, and his fight at sumpter is all a sham he will try to get influence in the North untill He can get the command of  an armey to deliver to the South and many play this game The Nations would like to use us up but they cannot do it    ENDENTRY April 22, 1861 ~ Monday   22 I attended a surgical operation at 11 oclok today Dr Anderson cut out a fleshy tumor near the armpit of Sister Daniel Thomas  near the size of a tea cup, she was under the influence of cloriform I spent most of the day in the office    ENDENTRY April 23, 1861 ~ Tuesday   23 I went to Wilford 25 m    ENDENTRY April 24, 1861 ~ Wednesday   24.

The South are better prepaired and much  faster than the North are. Lincoln has taken a course to rather  keep the North back. But the curse of God will be upon the  Nation and they will have Enough of it. The Rulers possess no  Power in the Land, they have persecuted the Saints of God  and the Rulers would do nothing for us but all they could against  us and they will now get their pay for it. In speaking of  Governor Cummings President Young Said He had done us good  He had stood between us and the army But the Lord had made  him do it. But He was united with the armey untill Col Kane  visited him when he first came here He was not going to the  army but I told him to go and to follow the same spirit that brought him out here He done so he went to the armey, and brought in Gov.  Cummings. The Govornor and Col Johnson was at swords points from that time. The question was asked what we would do if the  President sent Secretary Harris hiere as Govornor would we   ENDENTRY April 278 1861 not also cecede. President Youndg said No, we will keep  our records clean we shall want to compare records by and  by and we want to show on our part that we are right all the time. If the boys were all right they ought to piss such a man as Harris out of the country or whittle him out yet if we subm submit to such mean things put upon us by the government we shall get our reward and they will get therirs it is better for us to  submit to those things which are unplesant than for us to do wrong  and for all the oppressions they put upon us God will bring them into Judgment. In speaking of the war it is said that the South  threaten to burn the Northern Cities the North can play at that  Game also the ownly difficulty that I can see is there are  so many traiters in the North    ENDENTRY April 29, 1861 ~ Monday   29 It is warmer to day it has been vary cold for more than  a week.

Still I like to see such things got up Joseph would tell more in one hour about Geneology than the world can in a year. He was particular about such things much more so than I am but I expect He will be with  us. I expect if I live to be 80 years old I am in hops to have  some of the wisdom that Moses Had.

Now what are the facts in the case as far as they have come to the knowledge of the Historiamn. Thay are these. The whole European world have appeared inspired to spend millions and labor with all their might to build Navies and Equipt armies and prepare For a mighty struggle and deadly conflict with Each others All Italy has risen up in the magesty of her strengths under her great leader Garabaldi and flung off ^the^ galling Napolitan yoke and formed  an Elective Monarchy Receiving Victor Emanuel as their king Chineese Empire while they have both been preparing there armies and Navies for a Bloody struggle at home. But the United States of America  is the spot whare 1860 markes the commencement of a new Erea in the History of that Government and people, it is in the midst of this Government whare the God of Heaven has set up his kingdom in the Latter Days He sent An angel to this people thirty years ago raised up a prophet  called and ordained him to preach the gospel of Christ and Esstablish his  Church and kingdom in the midst of the people. Joseph the prophet of God  was Faithful to his calling, esstablished the Church of Christ, was filled with revelation and prophesy declaired the word of God unto the people told them what would come to pass in there midst the wars and  Judgments of God that awaited them because of there wickedness and as Jesus told the Jews the Fate and calamities that awaited the Jewish Nation so Joseph Smith the Prophet of God told the people of the United States Government what awaited them and there final Destiny as a Nation because of there wickedness and abominations and because they would shed the Blood of Prophets and Saints. He said in 1832, 28 years ago that war would commence at that place and that the Southern States would arise up in rebelion against the Northern States and the Northern States against the Southern States and that war would be poured out upon all Nations which would End in the death and miser of many of many  souls and because of these things or as the prophet has said the people of the   ENDENTRY 1860 United States have put to death the prophet Joseph the Patriarchs  Apostle and many Saints and driven the Church of Christ from  place to place for about thirty years and, Finally have driven them into the wilderness even into the these vallies of the Mountain and the Lord told us "to plead at the feet of the Judges Governors and Presidents of the United States and if they Heed us not and do not  redress us of our wrongs (then the Lord says) I will arise out of  my hiding place and in my fury I will vex the Nation and I  will cut off those wicked and unjust stewards and appoint them  there portiuns with Hipocritts and unbelievers. 1860 has laid the  foundation for the fulfillment of these things during this year the Abolitionest of Republicans of the Northern States Elected their President and Vice President and this has been taken as a pretext and the Southern States are rising up in rebelion agast the Northern States are holding conventions and preparing to cecede from the Union as Joseph Smith said they would. South Carolinia ceceded from the Union on the 270 Dec 1860 and others are preparing to follow their example this has caused a great convultion throughout the United States all Banking and monied institutions are suspending specia payment, and the wheels of Government are beginging to be cloged alarm and confusion is spreading throughout the whole land. The Lord is withdrawing his spirit from the Nation and they are begining to be filled with madness towards Each other and the Southern  States are arming and preparing for a Deadly conflict against the Northern States and whome the Lord wants to destroy he first makes mad and the people are being inspired with madness to such a degree that they are ready to devour each other, the foundation has been laid during the year 1860 To break up and annihilate the American Government and the scenes which will follow in quick succession  will be terrible and horrible in their detail. This Nation is guilty of sheding the Blood of the Lords anointed, of his Prophets and Saints and the Lord Almighty has decreed their destruction the Lord has commenced a controversy with the American Government and Nation in 1860 and he will never cease untill they are destroyed from under heaven, and the Kingdom of God esstablished  upon their ruins.

We dedecate the foundation  of this Hall, unto the Lord, the stone, the sand, clay, Lime and mortar and every  thing appertaining thereto that it may be Holy. We dedicate the walls of this  building the Adobies and mortar and evry thing appertaining thereto unto  the Lord that it may be Holy. We dedicate the windows the curtains, and  every thing conenected there with unto the Lord that they may be Holy. We dedic- ate the cealing the cornish, with its ornamenting and all belonging thereto  that it may be Holy. We dedicate the roof with the shingles, nails, sheeting,  rafters, and everything connected therewith unto the Lord that it may be Holy  We dedicate the doors with the Hinges latches and locks and all belonging thereto  unto the Lord that they may be Holy. We dedicate the floor with all belong  the seats and all belonging there to that it may be Holy. We dedicate  unto the Lord our God this pulpit and stand with the quishions and stand seats and triming that it may be the most Holy place for the priests of the  Lord to administer in Holy things. We dedicate the chandeliers with  the Lamps that they may be Holy unto the Lord. We dedicate this Build- ing as a whole from the foundation stone to the top thereoff with  every thing appertaining thereto that it may be Holy unto the Lord and we ask thee O God the Eternal Father wein askthe thee inname of Jesus  Christ that thou will except of the Dedecation of this House at the  Hands of thy people that it may be Holy, and will thou cloth  all of thy servants who shall administer in this House with the spirit  and gift of the Holy Goshost that they may    ENDENTRY 1861 Be Holy and may no unclean thing be permitted to dwell in this House. Whether the Priest of the Lord administer in  Holy things in this House or whether thy sons and daughters go forth in the dance in this House, may the spirit of the Lord  rest upon thy people that they commit no evil within the  walls of this House. We ask thee O God the Eternal Father  that thou wilt except of the dedication of this House at the  Hands of thy People in the Name of Jesus Christ Amen   At the close of the dedication Prayer President Brigham  Young arose and addressed the assembly He said as concerning  thatis House "andcI know but vary little about it I do not know for what purpose it was built if it was built for meetings alone I am satisfied  with it, but if it was built for school purposes it is not suitable I  have not been consulted concerning the building of this Hall, I did not  know that thery were building it untill the walls were Erected  I wonce gave a pattern for building schools houses in this city  for each ward but there has never been a school House built after  that pattern in this Territy. My pattern was sumthing like the  following Build two wings 20 By 30 feet for common schools  then build a centre Building say 30 by 60 feet make a Basement for  seting furnices or stoves for heating the whole building but not for school rooms. On the first floor above the basement at the south  End build a room for a Library then let there be a door  from each wing into the Library. OnLet the north End of the same room be appropriated for teaching the Higher Branches  and Let all scholars be classaified according to their ages  and qualifycations. Then let the 2nd story be formed into one room for a lecture room similar to this whare one class or all classes  may assemble to hear lectures upon any subject what ever. I wish to give a word of council to the people I shall not give any to the Bishop but I wish to say to the people dont you send  your children to go to school in this basement story it is not Healthy  asconcerning the Education of children I will say that not withstand- ing the drivings of this people I do not believe that you can  go into any city in the world and pick up 100 children promiscusly   ENDENTRY 1861 and put them by the side of our children that are as well educated  as the same number of our children gathered up promiscusly in the Territory of Utah. There are some people and countries who force  and whip their children into an Education but we should never  croud and force the minds of our children beyoung what they are able to bear if we do we ruin them for life. I would rather my children would spend their Early life sliding down Hill, skating, riding Horses  till they were 20 years old and not go to school one day than to clog  and force the mind while young with intricate studies it strains and cripples the mind for life and ruins the man, you never see a child that is confin- ed while young to close rooms and hard study and followed up to manhood that ever becomes a master spirit or qualifyed to transact difficult  business in after life. I do not think there is a man upon the face of  the whole Earth that has as great a complicated variety of subjects  and things to attend to to weigh upon the mind as I have, at the same time, I do not think there is a man upon Earth who can accomplish  as much business in an hour, day, month, or year, with as much Ease  and as little trouble as I do. But should I do as most people do it would  soon ruin me. But I thoroughly train my mind so that I permit  nothing to trouble me upon the Earth. I strive to do my duty in all things  upon the Earth then leave the Event with the Lord when any subject or  thing comes before me I train my mind in such away that I can bring  the whole force and strength of my mind to bear upon it and I keep it there untill I have done with the subject I comprehend every truth there is connected with the subject necessiary for the accomplish- ment of whatever business is before me, and as soon as the business is done I train my mind to instantly forget it and cast it away and should  never think of it again unless some circumstance should transpire  necessary to call it up. I am now at the dedication of this Hall  my mind is here when I get through and go away I may never  think of this meeting again unless some person should call it to  my mind. when I have been crouded with business through the day  and I go to my bed to rest though I may not be any more sleepy than  I am now, the moment I lie down I throw evry thing out of my mind untill it is like a peace of white blank paper I neither care for nothing  nor know nothing and in one minute I am asleep my wife has spoken   ENDENTRY Jan 1st 1861 to me many times in one minute after I have lain down and awaik me up. mMany other interesting remarks were made By President  J.

A pleasant morning I attended the funeral of Charles Little, the son of  FIGURE Young preached a short discourse on the occasion No reporter the following is a synopsis of what he said  I reflected upon the subject of coming to this funeral I thought If I  come Brother Little would wish me to speak and I thought I should want much of the spirit of the Lord to assist me to overcome my weakness to which  I am subject on occasions like this. At times I can overcome it. The question  has often been asked how is it with little children will they grow or not  after death Joseph once said they would, and then He said they would not He never had any revelation upon the subject. And I have no doctrin   ENDENTRY 31 Jan 1861 to give upon the subject. I Believe in the great variety in the vast creations of God. I do not Believe that the Lord ever made two worlds alike or things alike in any world, I do not believe that the Human family have been alike in stature in the various ages of this world. The Lord has power  to give a soul or spirit as miuch intelligence in a tabernacle 2 or 3 feet high as in a gient 8 or 10 feet high as we find Evidences that in some ages of  this world men have lived to that hight. My doctrin or belief is that we shall find all children and People at the resurrection as they lie down with the same stature, that is the way I want to receive my children if I bury a child that is two years old, I dont want him or her to come to me in a tabernacle 80 or 100 years old or at any other age ownly the age it left me and that is the way I believe it will be. We shall see there spirits before we see there bodies. Whare shall we go to find them in the spirit world but whare is that right here on the Earth whare they lived and whare we live. I have desired to see the spirit of a Friend and to convers with it as I would with you, but I have never yet had this privilege I want to know how they live in the spirit world what for a place they have as I would come and look at Brother Littles House. But I believe all spirits live here after Death and no whare Els, at least those who have taberna- cled in the flesh on the Earth, whether they be good or bad, Satan has no power over those who have overcome him in the flesh after they are dead but he has power over those who all their lives have been subject to him in the flesh. I will now ask how does any one present know what I say my words have a shape to them as much as this chair and the shape of my words go to the drum of your Ear so that you get an understanding of what I  say Now in speaking in the Tabernacle if I turn to the north the shape  of my words strike the drum of the Ear and they understand it perfectly the words strike the wall break the shape to peaces and the sound strikes the Ear of those in the South as much as in the North but they do not understand what is said. Now if I had force of Lungs and power to throw the shape of my words to China they would understand what I say  as well as you do in the further part of this room they would hear it as well. You know when you have a vision you can see as well all over  your Body as out of your Eye. When Joseph had a revelation he had the Eyes of the Lord He saw as the Lord sees how did I know what was going on in Washington. I have known what was going on there all the time   ENDENTRY 31st Jan 1861 And I know what is going on in other peoples Houses, I know it by the spirit of God it is revealed to me. Do spirits administer to us they do but we do not know it. Charles here will administer to  his mother but she will not know it. these things are so ordered and governed that we may be tried and if Sister Little was to die and go whare her children are in the spirit world she would do just so, she would not administered to her friends openly for she would see that it was for a wise purpose that there was a veil between the living and the dead that the living might be tryed and have a greater glory, the living cannot see the departed spirits but the departed spirits can see the living and administer to them while they know it not. We are all in the spirit world and in Eternity but we know it not and do not comprehend it. My  wife awoke in the morning that Charles died and said to me I think Charles Little is dead for I have seen him to night with Joseph in a dream and if Brother and Sister Little could see what I have they would not wish him back. He was vary happy with Joseph and Joseph said he wanted him he had a particular place for him, and He looked glorious. Many questions have arises in relation to the death of children. Some have thought that it was ordained that children should die. But this is not true doctrin it is not ordained of God that children should die, but it is the will of God that all children should live and  grow up to manhood and fill up the measure of there days if they could do it and overcome the evils they have to meet with in life but they meet with so much of the Law of Death and so many Evils that many die in childhood and at all ages. you may ask why should not they have a chance to prove themselves as well as we. As I said before there is a great variety the Human family die at all ages and children  that die thwill have a fulness of glory they will be as happy as they are capable of being, will they have another probation or chance  of being tried as we are are I have many reflections upon this subject but it is a doctrin I shall say nothing about. we should be satisfyed with the principle that our children will be restod restored to us again in their glorifyed bodies with the same  stature that they were taken from us, and they will admin- ister to us though we know it not it is hid from us for a wise purpose   ENDENTRY 31st Jan 1861 To give you a figure I will say to a man for instance if you will  go to Big Cotton wood Blindfolded I will give you a reward of Ten thousand dollars but you cannot have it if you go with your Eyes open to see the road, the man starts Blind folded fearing and trembling lest he shall run a foul of wild cattle, into ditches, and difficulties, yet he gropes his way and gets through claims his reward and gets it so in the dealings of the Lord with us He does not let us see every thing in the future before us but makes us promises and makes us walk by faith that we may obtain them and the greater our trials and conquests  the greater will be our crown and glory. So all those who have been tried and got through do not wish to administer to us in that way  that they will make it any lighter for us than it has been for them that all may be tried alike as far as is consistent with the Economy of God   E.

When he closed several  of his party got up and Bore the same testimony we then sent for there  fals Prophet and called upon him to speak, he spoke about half an hour He  said Brigham Young was not a prophet and Joseph Smith did not hold the  Keys of the Priesthood and was ordained of man while He Joseph Morris was  ordained of the Father, and held six times more keys of the Priesthood than  Joseph did He said he was the seventh Angel, and much other nonsens he  Presented before the Assembly, when He got through Elder Taylor spoke  to the Assembly and showed tbrother Cook the Position He was in. He bore testimony that Brigham Young was a prophet of God and he said that He him- self was more of a Prophet than Morris was. Brigham Young in saying   ENDENTRY 11 Feb 1861 that Joseph  Smith was, was speaking of men being born Natural Prophets and Seers  many have the gift of seeing through seer stones without the Priesthood  at all He had not this gift naturally yet He was an Apostle and the  President of the Church and Kingdom of God on the Earth and all the Keys of the Holy Priesthood and of Revelation was sealed upon him and the  spirit and power of Revelation was upon him daily when He closed  I spoke to the people and bore testimony to the truth of what Elder Taylor  had said. Morris had been cut off from the Church twice for  Adultery in the Territory And He had spent about one year with a woman whose husband was crazy. I told morris that He was not  a Prophet of God Neither was He the seventh Angels that when the 7th Angel came to Earth He would not spend the first year of his  mission with a woman whose Husband was crazy and commit Adultery  with Her. I showed the folly of Richard Cook and others following such a  man. When I closed my remarks Morris Denyed of Being with  that woman. Bishop West arose and bore testimony that what I  had said was true. We then took all the Names of the persons  who professed to believed in Joseph Morris as the prophet of God raised up to lead the Church. there was 16 Names Given as follows Richard Cook Hannah Cook  Margaret Cook  Hellen Cook Mrs Joanna Kendall John Taylor then moved that those sixteen named persons be  cut off from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I  seconded the motion and they were cut off from the Church without a disscenting voice. We then Nominated Philo Allen to Preside over  the remainder of that Branch of the Church which was carried  unanimously we also voted to unite that Branch to Ogden under the  charge of the President and Bishop of that Place.

It matters not to me  whether the lash hits me or you in the reproofs given by President Young, I feel to thank God that we are blessed with a leader who has  will of God let it reprove or  rebuke who it may. He asks no odds of any kingdom, Nations, people person or thing who stands in the way of his doing his duty. It is a Blessing to us that we have a leader who have Eyes to see for us when we are in danger ourselves and if we had not some one to warn us and reprove us when we do wrong we would not be safe. President Young is sustained  by the power of God and when he calls upon us to do any thing we ought to do it, and if we withhold we do it to our hurt. the Elders in England have beged of the people, untill they have bound them in chanes and kept them there in poverty if the Elders had pursued a wise course there are thousands who are now in England who would this day have been in Zion, then let us go to and fit out the missionaries and stop there begging from the poor.

Meeting opened By singing "Ear long the veil" vPrayer By Joseph Young John Young then spoke and said v I fell feel to acknowledge the Hand of God  in this thing. I dont fell this to be a matter of mo^u^rning though we feel to mis the society of our Friends when taken away, but we must follow our sister soon, and I pray that I may be as well prepared as she is. Nancy was the oldest of the Family and the last of the sisters that was taken away she is in her 75 year 57 years since she was married and she has always been a good woman and always kind to all. I dont know as I ever knew her  get out of the way she hag had good gifts and she received the gospel the first time she recieved itherd it she has been faithful to the last and now gone to  the spirit world I have not the power to make manifest that which is in me we must do the best we can in this life and in the next we shall receive a fulness but before I go home I want to have my work done  so that I can breath out my spirit in peace into the Hands of God. I want to use my time so that I have nothing to repent off. I want to live to do my work for If we leave our work to be done by somebody  els to do it will be a long time before it is done Like an Elder going on a mission leaves work to be done By some one Els it is undone.  Phineas Young said I have been Edified in what has been said yet  there has been Nothing said that I want to say, when my Friends die I want to speak of them If I was to say which of my sisters is the best I coold not tell, the last is gone, and the Brothers have got to follow  but I dont know who will go first. But if I was to make a choice and  chuse the one that has done the least good in the world or the one that was still likely to do the least good on the Earth it would be myself. I would like to go to the spirit world and be with my sisters I dont expect to do much good in this life yet I feel that I have done about the best I could.  I dont want to live my life over again to try to Better it for I dont expect I should. I dont want to live any longer than it is the will of God I should   ENDENTRY Sept 23 1860 Joseph Young spoke gave a good exertation but I have lost the minutes for the present   Brigham Young spoke and said I dont want to say much at this time though I reflect much and could say a good deal. I expet that  it will appear a Novel thing for a man to preach the funeral  sermon of his wife or sister or any of his own Family but I had rather preach the funeral sermon of my own Family or call upon my Brothers to do it than to call upon any body Els. there is a fear or trembling in the departure of the spirit from the body because it is attended with pain I have no fear of Being dead or being in the spirit world but there is a fear in dying because of pain Hence their is a terror in death, but no fear in having my spirit free but to get there is hard work. If the children of men  was in possession of the truth concerning Eternal things they would  not cling to life as they do. you know my feelings about mans  singing and doing wrong. I have been kept from Evil, sin, and suffering even in all the imprisionment and suffering and I feel that I have greater resason to rejoice I dont know that is because I am more righteous than other men But I have  greater reason to rejoice than other men in this thing. Sister Nancy was a good woman I never knew her get angry in my life or do wrong she would have done much good in her day if she had  a chance she has benen chained as it were but she has saved her- self and her husband and I think others, I dont wish her back  again. nor do I want to live my life over again neither do I want any of my sisters to return I do not wish to keep the people longer Lorenzo Young said there is a difference in men some were prepared for the gospel others not. I dont care how rough my life may be if I do the best I can. I was with Nancy a good deal and her  last words were Hosannah glory to God she wanted to say more but her speech failed. I do not wish to say much let us do good and shun Evil that we may not bring sorrow upon ourselves. I have often thought what would be the situation of many that have had great light and fallen away so that they could have no redemption there situation must be awful. it has been great Joy to Nancy to be with Brother Brigham and her friends, may God Bless us all is my prayer Amen   ENDENTRY 23 1860 I accompanied the corps to the grave after the corps was buried President Young returned thanks to the friends for there attendance and said I hope we may all live so that we can meet first  resurrection. I attended meeting at the stand at 2 oclok and Wm C. Stanes spoke and was followed By Wm Martindale  H C. Kimball, both of which spoke much to the Edifycation of the people   At the close of the meeting The Presidency and Twelve met the missionaries at the O Pratt Wm H Hooper, after which we repaired to  the prayer room, whare we had a vary interesting meeting. The subject of Orson Pratt came up again concerning his fals doctrin President Kimball wished him to make satisfaction to President Young But President Young said he did not wish him to make any acknowled- ments to him Brother Pratt was strangely constituted he had acquired a good deal of knowledge upon many things but in other things he was one of the most ignorant men he ever saw in his life He was full of integ- rity and would lie down and have his head cut off for me or his religin  if necessary but he will never see his Error untill he goes into the spirit world then he will say Brother Brigham how foolish I was Now Brother Pratt thinks that he and all the gGods will be learning for many millions of years but by and by will know all things and all will know it alike and that will be the End of their Exhaltations and knowledge he cannot see the folly of forming this opinion here in the flesh and in his ignorance. But a thousand years hence he will see the folly of it I will hold on to Brother Pratt and all these my Brethren of the Twelve (notwithstanding all their sins, folley, and weaknesses) untill I met with them in my Fathers kingdom, to part no more because they love God and are full of integrity. Brother Pratt said I do not  believe as Brother Brigham and Brother Kimball do in some points of doctrin and they do not wish me to acknowled to a thing that I do not believe Brother Brigham said No you cannot see the truth in this matter untill you get into the spirit world. Brother Brigham spake vary comforting  words to the 12 He said his love for them was far above women and I wish you could all say it.

He gave a short address He said the gentile chain was broaken  and they would never put their yoke again upon the neck of the saints  or church and Kingdom of God to all Eternity if we would do our  duty He blessed the Saints, and gave instruction to the sisters upon  the subject of wearing Hoops. He said when we followed that custom  we followed the custom of Hores and prostitute women and all  who ware large hoops expose themselves and show there folly He  advised the Sisters to lay them aside He gave good advice to all and had much of the spirit of the Lord He said we might build as many  Halls as we pleased and we should not find any place whare we should feel as well and have as much peace as we did in that Hall and he  warned the brethren not to attend balls or parties in the world with  the gentiles for then you are upon the gentile ground and the devils  ground and he will have power over you But if I invite Gentiles  to attend a party here they are under my controll and the spirit  of the Lord governs and the Gentiles have to be subject to it but go  to a Ball of there getting up and you become subject to them in spite  of all you can do then let it Entirely alone.
