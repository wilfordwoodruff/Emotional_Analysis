 Agricultural College of Utah.SECRETARY'S OFFICE.Logan, Utah, May 26th 1897.Prest. Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City.Dear President Woodruff:I forward herewith a letterjust received from Dr. Armenag ShilHagopian of Aleppo, Syria, Turkey.Bro. Hagopian was here about twoyears ago, at which time I thinkyou met him. He is now in chargeof the branch at Aleppo.Some months ago he sent me aletter descriptive of the hardshipsthey were undergoing and he lamentedvery much because the Church hadnot assisted them to get out of Turkey.I wrote him explaining that the membersthere did not give any evidence that theywould remain true should they comehere, and called his attention to the factthat all other people in other lands whohad joind the Faith would perhaps followwith the same request. But I told himto write me the condition of affairs thereand I would forward it to you. It seemsnow that persecutions have ceased somewhat that they are not so persistent. Several membersleft the Church because I was sent for to leave thatland when the trouble was on and they were notsent for. 
 I left there in December of 1895.I am of the opinion that permissioncould be had from the governmentfor our faith to be freely taught there.I have a petition in asking for the Consulshipat Beyrout and if I am successfulI will try and open the way for thepreaching of the Gospel in thatland, if you see fit. That is, I will doall I can to obtain these permissionsand the license to print or spread ourliterature.I am your humble servant inthe GospelE. W. Robinson 
 Big Cottonwood. Jan 8th 1897President Wilford Woodruff and Councillors. Salt Lake City Utah.Following is a letter adressed to me and Brother Stouffer but as I think it well for you to see for yourselves how our brethern feel and what is being done in Turkey I have translated part of the letter for your perusal and the larger part of the letter I have condenced and given the main ideas. It being possible that ^you^ might feel lead to write an epistle to the saints in that land as there are several items in this letters as well as in Bro. Nigoghosian's letter that should be answered.The letter reads as follows:Messer F. F. Hintze and F Stauffer. Dear ^and beloved^ Brethern in Christ. For two ^years^ until the present time I have with great desire expected news or letter from you, but have received none wherefore I am very anxious.I don t know, have we poor ones been entirely forgotten, or dont your letters reach us? For this reason I have a great desire to write to President Woodruff and also to our President in Liverpool, but I cannot write English and if I write turkish I suppose they can-not read it. For this reason I can only be patient and wait, for such information as God gives to help us in striving forward. For our desire is very great to meet with you in Zion, if possible, & there see you face to face: Oh, my dear brethren, dont we ever come into your rememberance, how there was a little church in Zara?, and dont you ever wonder what condition they are in? aAre they alive or are they dead? Are they backsliding or are they making headway, or what kind of exhortations do they, need? You 
 know the needs of this country very well. Because the wolves & the tares are among us it ^is^ hard to live spiritually as we shouldand as we are among the weakest how much ^more^ need have we not of listening to the voice of God and the advise of hHis Servants, so that through ^your^ medium we ^may^ receive the word and revalations of God and be a become blessed with spiritual blessings. For it is known to you that although a plant is planted in the tops of the mountains yet of the servants of hHim hwho plants attend to the plant & nurish it with the rains from heaven it will grow better and be more fruitful. We may have many teachers but you have begotton us in the Gospel, and we desire your prayers and help for the good of the little church here started so that by the help of God and His grace we may be faithful to the end. Amen.Dear Brethern I desire to communicate to you both the spiritual and temporal condition of the church. We praise God for His kindness to us in preserving us from destruction. For no matter how many souls have been killed and how manyuch proper-ty has been destroyed, here in Zara we have been protected by the Gov-ernment and the city Fathers. But yet though we are all alive we never feel safe. We feel we are but strangers in this land and often with tears in our eyes we pray to God for his blessings deliverance and that we may soon meet with you in Zion and behold that beau-tiful land and the temple of God and its blessings and the bles-sings of that land as you write to us.  Yea Lord come quickly and save us from the sins of Babylon ^and bring^ us to that Holy City Amen.Spiritually our little church is growing. We are now 18 members 6 males and 12 females. We meet every Sunday in fasting and prayer and partake of the Lord s supper and exhort one another to faithfulness. Besides this we meet every ^first^ Thursday in the month in 
 regular fast and privately other days and in this way the Lord gives us pattience and grace to be faithful.After this Brother to Nishan Sherinian writes of a BrotherNigoghos who started to come here and upon arriving in Constanti-nople and not obtaining means he made shipwreck of his faith and turned to the Seventh-day Advents. Upon returning to Zarahe introduced his new doctrine which was promptly rejected by the church. As Bro. Nishan says: "he brought doctrines that we never received from you". Bro. Nishan asks how to deal with him as he still claims his preisthood and says he has only perfected his doctrine or faith.  Please answer this. This man Nigoghorus was an Elder and Bro. Nishan a preist. I have wrote to know his present authority. Brother Nishan asks two questions: viz: About the Sabath day and about the washing of feet. He says he will not alow these new feature until he know^s^ whether or not they are excepted practices in Zion. He holds close to the faith we delivered to him. Bro. Nishan further relates a sad story of one of our sisters named Meriam Kizirin who was forci-ble taken by the authorities and married to an outsider, an Armenian, who now prevents her from attending meetings. She had her own home and was comfortable. This can be done in Turkey owing to their peculiar in-stitutions and yet we can have no redress because we are not recognized as a church. He closes thus: "And now dear Brethern we particularly ask you all to fast and pray for us that we may in the near future ^may be freed^ from Babylon and that He will deliver us from all danger and sin while we shall re-main here. May the grace of God be with us all. Amen.Needing Your prayers I remain your Brother in Christ.Nishan Shirinian,Zara, Sivus Vilayet,Turkey.I will only add that whatever may be said of the Armenian race we beleive there are many good people therr and that Brother Stauffer and I can faithfully testify that Bro. Nishan Sherinian is a true saint and a worthy representative of our cause in that far off land. He believed when I testified to him and at once excepted the truth He has performed a good mission in company with Elder Stauffer to Merrivan.I am as always your humble Servant.F. F. Hintze.

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints.P.O. Box B.Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 7, 1897.Beloved Brethren and Sisters in Turkey:We have lately received a numberof letters from various brethren addressed to Bro. Lefvon S. Abraham. Inthese letters a number of questions are sprung concerning your conditionand also asking about a future opportunity of gathering to some place inyour own land.First, we learn that the different branches of the Church in Turkeyneed a fuller organization, this has been ordered to be corrected throughthe office in Liverpool and Elder Armenag S. Hagobian. President Hago-bian should make a wvisit to the different branches of the church andordain a few worthy brethren to the office of elders and some to thelower priesthood so that there may be workers in each branch to supplythe necessary spiritual food and to preach the Gospel with authority tothose not acqiuainted with our doctrines. There are also some difficul-ties that should be straightened out so that all might work as one inJesus Christ our Lord.It is probable that before long some elders will be sent there againto labor, and we hope you will receive them as the servants of the livingGod sent to you to minister in the ordinances of life and salvation foryour good and for the good of the nations in that far off part of theworld. For the Gospel of Christ must be preached in all places accordingto the will of the Father before the end will come. Dear Brethren andSisters, you are inclined to be impatient, as though you alone hadtroubles to endure. This you should not be. The saints have troubles in 
 all the world, some more, some less, but all have to exercise patienceand by so doing show their devotion to God and His cause, and theirworks will in tijme shine forth out of the darkness that surrounds theworld. God will be glorified through our labors and our love of ourLord and Master Jesus Christ. Satan is pressing the saints everywherepossible. He knows his time is short and he loses no opportunity tooppress the saints and if possible to overcome. This we know he cannot,but he will try, and we must resist evil and do good, labor faithfullyand diligently and never tire, and although we cannot do as we like,let us not forget that this work is of God. He guides and he will in-spire his servants to mogve at the right time and in the right place.Wherefore, let us love, respect and pray for His servants that they mayhave the Holy Spirit to guide them and that the saints may have the Com-forter to help them to understand their counsels and to carry them out.This work is great. We mean the work of redemption, and the laborers arefew in comparison to the greatness of the work. Calls for elders andGospel knowledge are extensive and where the nations seem ripe to havrvestmany are sent and many precious souls are redeemed from the false doc-trines and traditions of the world and as soon as the way seems clear thework in Turkey will be pushed forward. For, to the land of Palestine aremade great promises, and if you remain faithful you will be instrumentalby your prayers, faith and works to help fulfil many fof the gloriouspromises. Teach your children as best you can the Gospel of Christ, sothat when they are eight years old they can be baptized and confirmedmembers of Hic Church, for so has God commanded us in these days. Anduntil you can be gathered to one place where you can have the home rule,the laws and privileges of the country affords, let your children attendthe Protestant schools and learn to read and write and do the best youcan for them, and God will give the children sufficient of His Spiritto discern good from evil. Let dfather and mother teach and exhort them 
 at home about the Gospel, and the Protestants will have no power over thechildren to lead them astray. God has much good among all nations andthis he will consecrate for the upbuilding of His kingdom. We are allHis children and He has joy in good works and in the progress of Hischildren and the saints above all should be fully tolerant and observant,and kind and good, always speaking the truth, do right, and above all,be virtuous in thought and deed.Of the young sisters of whom you write, we would say it is best notto give them in marriage to any bust saints, if possible. Let themrather wait the time of the Lord. Good men will be found in time. It isnot good for saints and sinners to be bound together. Be patient inwell-doing. These questions about the children and young sisters arethe same as we find among the saints in all lands where they are scatt-ered, and they have to abide the Lord's time until they can be changedin the proper way. We do not build school-houses nor support schoolsonly where the saints locally are able to do so; it is not in the line ofour work, but we sustain the laws and institutions of the country wherewe go, and find that good results follow, for so the Lord has revealedto us.We hope and pray to God that a way may be opened, that a gatheringplace for our people may be found somewhere in the promised land. Foras we are of Israel we feel the promises are unto us and we look forwardto the day when God will move upon the rulers in Turkey to set apart aplace for us to live, and there acknowledge us as a people and give usliberal government and such privileges as insure peace and prosperity tous and the nation. Do not despair, Latter-day Saints, were you incountries ruled by some of the Christian potentates, you would not haveas much liberty as you now have, neither could our hopes be so bright forthe future. For priestcraft and sin and misrule are very great in manynations, so much so that we cannot preach the Gospel there at all. 
 Be sure we will do all we can for you, you are of us; we are all onebody in Christ; we have one Lord; we all drink at the same fountain; weare all looking for redemption through the only name given under heavenwhence comes salvation. Now that our faith is one and our hope the same,let us seek to be filled with the love of God. Let us always seekprofitable conversations, leaving mysteries alone. Read the scripturesdfor they are profitable to us for instruction. And more particularlylet us seek for the possession of the Spirit ogf God to be our guide andto increase our testimonies. Do not discuss the time of the coming ofChrist in an unprofitable manner. There is a time appointed, and Godonly knows it. He has not revealed it. But the appointed time willsurely come long before most people are prepared. This we know, it isnot far distant, for the signs of his coming are now very plain. Butthere is yet much to do to prepare for his coming that great event. Manyof the honest have not yet heard of His great Latter-day work. Zion mustbe fully established. Jerusalem must be rebuilt by the Jews, the tentribes must return from the north, the American Indians, who are of thehouse of Israel must be converted and become workers in His cause. Andmany more of the different branches of the House of Israel must returnto the promised lands and be prepared to meet Him and to receive Him. FRoorHe will be their King when He comes. God's words must all be fulfilledand we must wait patiently and labor in the fear of God that we may bewith His holy company when He comes. For hHe Wwill come in the cloudsand save His saints while His angels will reap the earth and cleanse it frfrom sin.Brother Levon Abraham, who is here, is a faithful and humble memberof the church. He has a great desire to do good. His whole soul islaboring to do you good, and when he has learned the English language hewill return to you and be instrumental in doing much good, if he remainsfaithful. He has given us much comfort concerning the saints in Turkeyand his labors here in Zion in your behalf will be of great benefit toyou in time to come.Your Brethren in the Gospel,Wilford WoodruffGeo.

In regard to Elder W B Dougall Jr, President B Youngwho will have reached You ere this, will give You all information inconnection with Him, Wilby is still with His Uncle John W Young at22 Portland Place, ^London^.  We received a letter from Him last night, in whichHe says Am getting better everyday and beginning to feel like myselfonce more,  He said in His Letter that S M Barrett is quite sick , Yourinstructions, in relation to Wilbys future developments will be adhered toElder Thos E Taylor is here with us at 42, one number of the Star has beenissued since Wilby left for London and this Weeks number is all ready forthe Press, Brother Taylor thinks with the help of the Brethren He will getalong.  You said in Your last letter to President Young You had not beenadvised as to how many Elders would be needed for the Scandinavian MissionI wrote to President Christiansen, receiving His answer yesterday, in which Hesaid the number needed, would be Twelve Sweeds, Ten Danes, andEight Norweigens, He said He had forwarded some names to this office 
 early in January of Elders in Utah whom He thought would make goodMissionaries, which I have looked for, but failed to find. He said in HisLetter the Financial Condition of the Mission is very poor, saying theiroffice held Notes of several Parties in Utah and other places, asking the questionwhat He should do in the matter,  I thought of writing for Him to send toYour Office, the full particulars of the Matter, and You would advise HimWe have several applications coming in from different parties, asking theRates to points in Colorado and Arizona, if Our Agents in Utah couldanswer this question by stating something near the amount, it would confer afavor. Last Sunday I visited the NewCastle Conference, the Meetingsbeing held at Stockton on Tues, the Brethren said they had sparead aroundthree thousand hand bills, advertising the Conference, some few strangers were present who had come on the invitation of their friends, not one had come, asthe Brethren thought & ^through^ their advertising. I spent nine months last Winter and Springin this Conference being there during the great Strike of the Coal Miners, whichaffected most of the Iron and Steel works in that region also the Shipbuilding,Stockton itself have six iron, and two steel plants, each plant employing athousand men once upwards today the two steel plants are working, while thesix iron plants are all idle, there being no demand for iron, out of eleven of ourBrethren living in Stockton only one is in Work, the President of the Conference,said they would have to give up renting their Hall, as Himself, and Elders havehad to pray most of the expenses, of that and the Conference House, one of themembers of the Branch is now in the Hospital with the Small Pox it seemsalmost impossible for young Men to get work in this country, it looks like apreconcerted plan, among the employers, not to employ them, which enforcesthem to enlist in the Army, they are taken to India, Egypt, and other placeswhere it is said a large percentage of them die off not being acclimated Isaw quite a number of young Soldiers parting with their mothers, Sisters, and friendswhile in the Manchester Stateion on Tuesday lastI expect the Saints are lookingat Home are looking forward to a Glorious time at the Dedication of the Temple.

The Brethern for Scandinavia leavein the morning. I wrote a few weeks ago in regard to what rules are observedin Releasing Presidents of the Mission on the Continent. President Farrell andElder Wm Hyde of the Netherland Mission left their Homes some time in Feb1891 and have been hinting to us in regard to their Release. We expect asmall company to Emigrate from tha mission, not hearing from you inregard to this matter, I have taken the liberty to ask President Farrellto name some one to take His place, that Himself and Elder Hyde can berelesed to accompany there Saints Home. I have been in receipt of Letters from President Fred Clawson, of the London Conference, speaking ofElder E. J. Farnes now laboring in that Conference, of His financial conditionbeing very low, I learned while in London about two months ago He had givenHis note for four pounds borrowed money,  He receives no assistance from Home,and has been borrowing ever since. The Elders there feel they learn all theycan stand up to, and cannot help him any more, Elder Farnes is 56 yearsold, and can do very little walking, one of His feet troubles Him very much 
 President Clawson says, He is not a man of sound judgement, and very littlewisdom in discharging His duties.

 before I get through, to the risinggeneration of Israel. My remarks maybe very eccentric to any but Latter-day Saints, and to them also, I expect.I suppose when I was born the devilknew what I should be called to do;for there has been from the day I wasborn until the present two powers withme one to kill me, the other to saveme. I stand before you today a prettysound-looking, for a man ninety-oneyears of age. I stand before you witha body in which almost every bone hasbeen broken except my back and neck.I have had through my life a power af-ter me to take my life. When I wasabout three years old I was pushedinto a caldron of boiling water, whichhad just been taken off the fire. Mygrandmother took me out, and my skinall dropped off excepting off my headand feet. I was wrapped up formonths in cotton and oil. That wasthe beginning of my troubles. WhenI was twelve years of age I wasdrowned; at any rate, I lay in thirtyfeet of water long enough to drownanyone. After several unsuccessfulattempts, I was brought up out of thewater. This was under the Farming-ton mill dam. I was just as dead asI shall be thirty years hence. I lay onmy back and saw the sun go out, andpassed through all the sensations of death that any man would in drown-ing. After an hour's labor, I wasbrought around to life again. I shallnot go into the particulars of many ofthese things, but I have passed[throug]h what may be termed death anumber of times in my life. When Iwas 15 years old I was in one of thoseConnecticut blizzards. I walked fourmiles through a wood into the opencountry, and I sought some placewhere I could hide from the stormand rest. There was but one housewithin a mile of me that was thepoor house, which was about twenty-five rods away. The man was movedupon to go up in his garret to get somepennyroyal to give to a sick woman,and he felt led to look out of the win-dow. He saw me crawling into the hollow of a big tree. He knew whatthe result of that would be better thanI did. He took his horse and sleighand came to me, and when he gotthere I was asleep, and he preservedmy life. When I was 14 years old Iwas bit by a mad dog, and ought tohave died; but I did not. So I contin-ued on, until I can say that I havebroken both of my legs, one twice;broken both of my arms, breast bone,several ribs, and altogether beenthrough a pretty hard experlence fora man who had to be called to preachthe Gospel, at least. I was a millerby trade. I have been in two waterwheels under full head of water, andI suppose I ought to have been killedin either of them, but I was not hurt.That preserving power has followed me all the way through my life. Ithas been with me upon my missionsabroad as well as at home. It hasfollowed me until the present day, andI have been placed in a great manystrange places.I was ordained to dedicate this SaltLake Temple fifty years before it wasdedicated. I knew I should live todedicate that Temple. I did live to doit. I had a great desire in my boyhoodto receive the Gospel of Christ, to seea prophet or somebody that couldteach me the Gospel of Christ astaught by the ancient Apostles and asI read of in the New Testament. I desired this with every sentiment ofmy heart, and on the first Gospelsermon I ever heard I was baptized,with my oldest brother. I immediate-ly went to Kirtland. I was in Zion'sCamp with the Prophet of God. I sawthe dealings of God with him. I sawthe power of God with him. I saw thathe was a Prophet. What was mani-fest to him by the power of God uponthat mission was of great value tome and to all who received his instruc-tions. I will refer to one instance.A short time before we landed inMissouri Joseph called the camp to-gether. He there prophesied unto us, and told us what lay before us. Hegave us the reason why chastisementwas before us. He says: "You con-sider me a boy with the rest of you.You have not realized my position be-fore the Lord. But there is a chas-tisement before this camp." He told usthat this would come upon us becausehe had not been obeyed in his counsels.In one hour after we landed in Mis-souri and pitched our tents at Mr. Burkett's, one man began to fall here, 
 another there, and in a few momentswe had a dozen of our camp stretched upon blankets with cholera. TheProphet of God, when he saw this,felt to sympathize with them, and heand Hyrum laid their hands uponBrother Carter, the first man thatwas taken sick, but as soon as theydid it they were seized themselves,and they both had to leave the camp.He said afterwards: "I told you whatwas coming to pass, and when afflic-tion came I stretched out my hand tostay it, and I came very near fallingby it myself." That mission was veryinteresting to me.I want to say here that in all mylife since joining this Church andkingdom, notwithstanding these pow-ers that have been with me to killme, I have always had the revelationsof God with me. That is somethingI want to talk about to Israel beforeI get through. The power of God hastold me what to do and what not todo. While the devil has had powerto afflict my body very seriously, therehas been a power with me that hassaved me through it all. And, when-ever I have had the Holy Spirit withme to tell me what to do, I have hadto do that. By that I have beensaved. By listening to that still smallvoice I am here today with you. Thereare two reasons why I am there today.When I went back after the pioneerjourney, President Young said hewanted me to take my family and goto Boston, and stay there till I couldgather all the Saints of God in NewEngland and Canada and bring themto Zion. That was the mission hegave me on my return from the pio-neer journey to Winter Quarters. Iwent in the spring, as he told me, andtook my family. We came one even-ing to one of the brethren's houses inIndiana. Several of us were there.Orson Hyde had a team as well as my-self. We drove into a long yard. Iset my carriage within six inches ofhis. I had my wife and children withme. I tied my animals to an oak treeon the other side of where we camped.I went to bed in my carriage. As Ilaid down, the Spirit of the Lord toldme to get up and move my carriage.I did not ask the Lord what Hemeant. I did as I was told. The sameSpirit told me to go and move myanimals away from that tree. I didthat. My wife asked me why I did it.I told her I did not know. I had notbeen in bed twenty minutes whenthere came a whirlwind and took thatoak tree, which had stood there per-haps fifty years, split it right throughthe trunk, and it swept through bothof those fences where my carriage hadstood. It never touched Brother Hyde'scarriage, but it would have crushedme and my family to the earthif I had not listened to the voice of theSpirit. After spending two years anda half in New England and Canada,getting the Saints out, I started back with the last lot, about a hundred,from Boston. We landed in Pitts-burg at dusk. We were anxious notto stay there, but to go on to St.Louis. I saw a steamer making steamready to go out. I went to the cap-tain and asked him how many passen-gers he had. "Three hundred and fif-ty." "Could you take another hun-dred?" "Yes." I was just about to tell him we wanted to go aboard whenthat Spirit said to me, "Don't goaboard that steamer, you nor yourcompany." All right, said I. I had learned something about that still,small voice. I did not go aboard that steamer, but waited till the next morn-ing. In thirty minutes after that steamer left, it took fire. It had ropes instead of wheel chains, and they couldnot go ashore. It was a dark night,and not a soul was saved. If I hadnot obeyed the influence of that moni-tor within me, I would have been there myself, with the rest of the company.The Thirteenth ward would not havehad an Atwood for a Bishop; theChurch would not have had a LeonardW. Hardy as Bishop. They were bothwith me, and their families, includingBrother Samuel Hardy, who is in St.George now, upwards of ninety yearsold. I never disobeyed that Spiritbut once in my life; I did it thenthrough the urgency of other persons,and it nearly cost me my life. I havebeen acquainted with this Spirit. Itwas not the blow of trumpets northunder and lightning; it was the stillsmall voice to me. All the way frommy boyhood I have been governed andcontrolled by that Spirit. My missions 
 have been by that Spirit of revelation.I was told to go to Fox Islands bythat same still small voice. In thetime of the great apostasy in Kirtlandthe Spirit of the Lord said to me, "Getyou a partner and go to Fox Islands."I knew no more what was in FoxIslands than what was in Kolob. Iwent there, however, baptized a hun-dred and brought them up to Zion withme. It was upon that island where Ireceived a letter from Joseph Smith,telling me that I was called by revela-tion to fill the place of one of theTwelve who had fallen. You will seeit in the Doctrine and Covenants. Thatthing was revealed to me before I re-ceived the letter from Joseph Smith,but I did not feel disposed to tell it toany mortal man, for I knew it was myduty to keep such things to myself.Through all my life and labors, when-ever I have been told to do anything bythe Spirit of the Lord, I have alwaysfound it good to do it. I have beenpreserved by that power. That power was with me when I went to Hereford-shire. I was preaching every night with Brother Cordon, and one night weheld a meeting in the town hall atHanley, in Staffordshire. The Spirit that still small voice said to me, "Thisis the last meeting you will hold withthis people for many days." I told thecongregation so when I got up. Theywere very much astonished, and askedme where I was going. I told them Idid not know. After, I went to ask the Lord what he wanted of me, and Hetold me to go to the south. That wasall the answer I got. I took the stageand rode eighty miles south. The firstman's house I went into was John Ben-bow's. I had not been in his housefifteen minutes till I understood whythe Lord had sent me there. Therewas a people broken off from the Wes-leyan Methodists, who had bandedtogether and called themselves UnitedBrethren. They were watching for thecoming of the Son of Man, watchingfor the Gospel of Christ, as they read ofit in the New Testament. The first thirty days after I got there I broughtinto the Church some two thousand,with fifty ministers, and all theirchapels, licensed according to law, werein my hands. There was no blowingof trumpets about that. The Spirit ofthe Lord told me to go there, and whenI got there I saw why I was sent.That is, perhaps, enough tosay about those things. Now, I want to say to this congregation, tothe young men of Israel, to the Eldersof Israel, to all our missionaries, theday has come when the God of heavenrequires at my hands, as the Presidentof the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, to say unto you, itis the will of God for you to take thiscourse. Get the Spirit of God beforeyou go on your missions or anywhereelse. Get the spirit of revelation with you. And when you get that you aresafe, and you will do exactly what theLord wants you to do. I have feltstrongly impressed to say that to thisConference. What can you do with-out revelation? We cannot do the willof God and accomplish what is re-quired of us without it. We will makeno mistakes if we pursue that course.That spirit is with the Apostles, andwith the Elders of Israel who are trueand faithful. The rising generationshould labor to obtain the Spirit of God. Get it within you and it will bea continual monitor with you.That is one reason, brethren and sis-ters, why my life has been preserved.I will tell you another reason. Ofcourse, this is my own reason for it.One reason why I am here is becausethe Lord has chosen the weak thingsof this world to preach the Gospel, todo His work, to build up His kingdom.I do not think He has ever had a weaker instrument on earth to workthrough than myself. The Almightyhas known that never for a minutesince I have been a member of thisChurch have I had any power to takeany honor or glory to myself with re-gard to anything that I have been en-abled to do in the work of the ministryor elsewhere. Why? Because I haveknown it has come from God, and notfrom me. And no other man who hasengaged in this work has had any pow-er of himself. This power has comefrom God unto us, whereby we havebeen enabled to do the work He has re-quired at our hands.There is a change coming over theearth; there is a change comingover the Christian world; and itis at our door. You read therevelations in the Bible, in the Book ofMormon and in the Doctrine and Cove-nants appertaining to our day and the 
 generation before the coming of the Sonof Man. War! Yes; war is one of thetroubles that belong to the generationin whlch we live. It will come to pass,and no power beneath the heavens canstay it. Who cannot open their eyesand see the change in the things around us? Read these revelations the revela-tion just read by Brother Cannon, andthe others in these books. The God ofheaven has set His hand to carry outthese great purposes that you read of.They are as sure to come to pass asthat God lives. There is no power onearth, nor beneath the earth, nor any-where else, that can stay the fulfill-ment of these things. And they are atour doors.I am anxious that the Latter-daySaints shall round up their shouldersand bear off the kingdom of God. Manyin the world have labored to try theoverthrow [of] Mormonism. They havedriven our people from their lands.They have persecuted and afflicted us.They have put some to death, for theword of God and testimony of Jesus.But they have not thwarted the pur-poses of God in any of these things.The Lord, in His mercy and wisdom,has led this people to these valleys ofthe mountains. It is ordained of Godthat Zion is to be established here.Here is the Tabernacle that theProphet spoke of as a covering fromthe storm and the wind, etc. Thesetemples are here in fulfillment ofprophecy. We have four of them in thisState. President Young was honoredof God in the establishment of thesethings. He lived long enough to dedi-cate the corner stone of this Temple onthis block, into which the Latter-daySaints go and deliver their friends whoare in the prison house, and attendto the ordinances of the house of Godfor them, in fulfillment of the ancientProphets, who spake as they weremoved upon by the Holy Ghost, to theeffect that saviors should be raisedup on Mount Zion in the latter dayswhile the kingdom is the Lord's. Zionhas got to arise."Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, Oearth; and break forth into singing, Omountains; for the Lord hath com-forted His people, and will have mercyupon His afflicted."But Zion said, The Lord hath for-saken me, and my Lord hath forgottenme."Can a woman forget her sucklingchild, that she should not have com-passion on the son of her womb? Yea,they may forget, yet will I not forgetthee."Behold, I have graven thee upon thepalms of my hands; thy walls are con-tinually before me." (##Isaiah 49:13-16|Isaiah, 49:13-16##.)All that has been spoken concerningZion will come to pass, and you and Itoday are witnesses of these things.We are here for salvation and eter-nal life. We are here to obtain thosegreat blessings which Saints of Godin every age of the world have obtainedwhen they have obeyed the command-ments of God. Shall we fail? No, we shall not if we do our duty. The Gospelis just as good today as it was inthe days of the Savior. As to the glor-ious blessings of the Gospel of Christ, they have been unpopular in almostevery age of the world. Take ChristHimself: where was there a more un-popular man than the Savior of theworld in His day? And His Apostleswere unpopular. They were put todeath for the word of God and testi-mony of Jesus Christ. Nevertheless,Christ was the Son of God; and theSaducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes,and all the sects that warred againstHim were cursed and many of themwere cast down to hell, while He re-mains as the Savior of the world, andreceived the honor and the glory whichHis Father had ordained forHim. I want our youngpeople especially to remem-ber these things. Those who are goingupon missions must not neglect them.Unless you have the HolyGhost with you when you go outto preach the Gospel, you cannotdo your duty; but when youhave that you are safe, go where youwill, and your words will have theireffect in the hearts of the honest andmeek of the earth.Brethren and sisters, I feel to thankGod that we are as well off as we are.I feet [feel] to thank God that we are in theposition we occupy in these valleys ofthe mountains. Here is a safe place.While in the dedication of that TempleI saw the judgments of God that wereabout to be poured out upon this gen- 
 have been given. Joseph Smith wasfull of revelation. He foresaw thispeople, and this work until it waswound up.My prayer to God is that we maypursue such a course that we may en-joy and receive all these blessings, andour posterity after us. Amen. 
 eration. They will come to pass. Iread the other night of a terrible flood.Who ever heard of such a flood inAmerica before? These floods, andtroubles and tribulations are increasingin the earth, and they will increase un-til this scene is wound up. I pray Godmy Heavenly Father to bless you all, to inspire our hearts, that the visionof our minds may be open to compre-hend the position we are in and the re-sponsibility we are under. The eyes ofall heaven and earth and hell are overus. The eyes of the devils are over us.They labor for our destruction; butthey have not power to do it. We arein the hands of God. He holds the keysof the destinies of the inhabitants ofthe earth, and He will bless therighteous, no matter who they are norwhere they are. I am thankful tolisten to the teachings that I haveheard at this Conference from the El-ders of Israel. I rejoice in the progressthat has been made during the past year in the Church abroad. There hasbeen an addition to the Church that wehave never met with in any other yearsince the organization of this Church.And here at home there has been agreat addition. Our sisters have laboredfaithfully in the Primary Associations,in the Mutual Improvement associations,and in every capacity in which they are called to labor. The blessings ofGod are with them, and they are doingmuch good. The Sunday schools havealso added to their numbers. Theyhave now over one hundred thousandmembers. The Young Men's MutualImprovement Associations, as has been said, have an addition of aboutthirteen thousand as a result of theirlabors the past year. God is blessingthose who labor among them. If youcan save a soul from death, what bless-ings you will have with that soul. Asthe Lord said to Oliver Cowdery, "Ifit so be that you should labor all yourdays in crying repentance unto thispeople, and bring, save it be one soulunto me, how great shall be your joywith him in the kingdom of myFather." We should continue in thislabor, that we may gain the salvationof the souls of men. Inasmuch as youwill do this, the blessings of God will attend you. Zion has got to arise or fall. Which shall it be? Theproclamation of the Gospel of Christis in favor of Zion. All the revelationsappertaining to this day are in favorof Zion, and of preparing the way forthe coming of the Son of Man. AndZion will arise and shine.God bless you, one and all. Let usdo our duty and seek to magnify ourreligion, that when we get through wewill rejoice in that. It is better to beon the Lord's side than anywhere else.I want salvation. I want to meet myforefathers and my friends whom Ihave labored here to redeem, whonever heard the Gospel in their dayand generation. God has given us thisprivilege. We have Elders of Israellaboring in all these temples day byday for the salvation of the childrenof men. We have been blessed in thislabor, and we will continue to be blessed; and when we get on the otherside of the veil there is not one of usbut will rejoice for the good we havedone. May God bless you. I feel tobless the Latter-day Saints, as far asI have power to bless. Our daughtersand our mothers are laboring for the salvation of Israel in their line, and soare the Elders of Israel in their line.But we want to increase and continueto increase, until we have power in the earth to gather up all the honestand meek of the earth. God bless, guide and direct us all in the path of truth and righteousness, for Jesus'sake. Amen.At the conclusion of his remarksthe vast congregation arose en masseand in unison with the choir, sang:We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet,To guide us in these latter days. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFHistorical incidents Keys of power from Joseph tothe Twelve Founders of our nation inspired Afflictions awaiting the world Importance of re-deeming the dead.At the close of this Conference Ihave a desire to bear my testimonybefore you upon a few principles.  Ihave rejoiced very much during thisConference in listening to the testi-mony of the Apostles and Elders whohave spoken.  It has brought to myrememberance a little of my history. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFIn April, 1838, while in the town ofKirtland, in walking across the streetI met two men who held the Apostle-ship.  They said to me, "BrotherWoodruff, we have something that wewant you to join us in."  Said I, "Whatis it?"  "We want another Prophet tolead us."  "Whom do you want?""We want Oliver Cowdery.  JosephSmith has apostatized."  After listen-ing to them, I said to them:  "Unlessyou repent of your sins you will bedamned and go to hell, and you willgo through the fulness of eternaldamnation, and all your hopes in thislife will pass before you like the frostbefore the rising sun.  You are false.Joseph Smith has not apostatized.He holds the keys of the kingdom ofGod on earth, and will hold them untilthe coming of the Son of Man, whetherin this world or in the world to come."I am happy to say that those men didrepent pretty soon, turned to theChurch, and died in it.I feel thankful today that Joseph F.Smith is with us as a son of HyrumSmith.  He bears a true and faithfultestimony of his father.  I would toGod that Joseph Smith had a son inthe flesh who would do as Joseph F.Smith does here bear testimony tothe truth of his father.  The ProphetJoseph Smith has no son that standsin the midst of the Church of God andbears record of his father.  He neverhas had; possibly never will have.I will give you a testimony here thatwill show you where I stand with re-gard to this matter.  Joseph Smithnever ordained his son Joseph, neverblessed him, never set him apart, tolead this Church and kingdom on theface of the earth.  When he or anyother man says he did, they state thatwhich is false before high heaven.The last speech that Joseph Smithever made to the quorum of the Apos-tles was in a building in Nauvoo, andit was such a speech as I never heardfrom mortal man before or since.  Hewas clothed upon with the Spirit andpower of God.  His face was clearas amber.  The room was filled aswith consuming fire.  He stood threehours upon his feet.  Said he:  "YouApostles of the Lamb of God havebeen chosen to carry out the purposesof the Lord on the earth.  Now, Ihave received, as the Prophet, seer andrevelator, standing at the head of this dispensation, every key, every or-dinance, every principle and everyPriesthood that belongs to the lastdispensation and fulness of times.  AndI have sealed all these things uponyour heads.  Now, you Apostles, ifyou do not rise up and bear off thiskingdom, as I have given it to you,you will be damned."I am the only witness left on earththat can bear record of this, and Iam thankful that I have lived to seethe day in which I stand.  I am thank-ful to see the sons of these Prophetsand Apostles holding the Holy Priest-hood in our day and generation.  I donot believe the day will ever come it is too late in the day, in my opinion when any Elder in this Church willbe called to stand before any two ofthe Apostles with us today and giveunto them the declaration that I gaveunto the two Apostles I have referredto.  I do not think any of the Apostleswill occupy that position.  I have faithto believe that these men who bearthe Apostleship will hold it and livetheir religion.  They have been calledand ordained of God for this purpose.I do not think that one of them willapostatize.  I believe they will be withyou and with this Church while theystand in the flesh, true and faithfulto God.Brother Cannon has been laying be-fore you something with regard to thenation in which we live and what hasbeen said concerning it.  I am goingto bear my testimony to this assembly,if I never do it again in my life, thatthose men who laid the foundation ofthis American government and signedthe Declaration of Independence werethe best spirits the God of heavencould find on the face of the earth.They were choice spirits, not wickedmen.  General Washington and all themen that labored for the purpose wereinspired of the Lord.Another thing I am going to sayhere, because I have a right to say it.Every one of those men that signedthe Declaration of Independence, withGeneral Washington, called upon me,as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ,in the Temple at St. George, two con-secutive nights, and demanded at myhands that I should go forth and at-tend to the ordinances of the House of 
 GENERAL CONFERENCE.God for them.  Men are here, I believe,that know of this, Brothers J. D. T.McAllister, David H. Cannon andJames G. Bleak.  Brother McAllisterbaptized me for all those men, andthen I told those brethren that it wastheir duty to go into the Temple andlabor until they had got endowmentsfor all of them.  They did it.  Wouldthose spirits have called upon me, asan Elder in Israel, to perform thatwork if they had not been noblespirits before God?  They would not.I bear this testimony, because it istrue.  The Spirit of God bore recordto myself and the brethren while wewere laboring in that way.What has been said with regard tothis nation and to our position is com-ing to pass.  All the powers of earthand hell will not stay the hand ofAlmighty God in the fulfillment ofthose great prophecies that haveto come to pass to prepare the wayfor the coming of the Son of Man.You who have gathered here are mywitnesses of this.  I feel as though theday has come when every Elder andevery Latter-day Saint ought to stopand consider the position he is in andthe covenants he has entered into.  Isthere anything on the face of the earththat will pay you to depart from theoracles of God and from the Gospel of Christ?  Is there anything that willpay you to lose the principles of sal-vation, to lose a part in the first resur-rection with the privilege of standingin the morning of the resurrectionclothed with glory, immortalityand eternal life at the head ofyour father's house?  No, there isnothing.  I feel sorry many times whenI see men who have the Priesthoodforget almost that they have any in-terest in the work of God.I feel to thank God that I have livedas long as I have, and to see as muchas I have in fulfillment of the wordsof the Prophet of God.  His days werefew.  The lives of great men have beenstrange.  The idea of Jesus Christ, theSon of the living God, only laboringthree years and a half in the ministryand then He was put to death!  HisApostles, too, were put to death, ex-cepting John the Revelator, and theywould have killed him if they couldhave done so.  He lived because Godwanted him to live.  We live in thelast dispensation and in the midst ofthe great work that all the Patriarchsand Prophets since God made theworld have spoken of.  Afflictions andtribulations await the world.  Thedestroying angels have got their sharpsickles in their hands, and they aregoing to reap the earth.  Everythingthat has been spoken by the prophetsunder the inspiration of the HolyGhost will come to pass in the genera-tion in which we live.  Do not forgetit.  I thank God we are as well as weare; that we have as many as we havewho are united together in the Priest-hood.  Let us try to live our religion,do our duty, and magnify our callingwhile we are here.  The eyes of allheaven are over us.  The eyes of theworld are over us.  The eyes of theangels are over us.  The Lord haslooked upon us and upon the house ofIsrael to be saviors of the nations.We are here to fulfill these principles.I pray God my Heavenly Fatherthat as Elders of Israel and as Lat-ter-day Saints we may prize theseprinciples, and that we may do ourduty what time we spend here in theflesh.  These Apostles and all thequorums of the Priesthood have agreat work upon them.  Every fatherand mother has a great responsibilityresting upon them, to redeem theirdead.  Do not neglect it.  You willhave sorrow if you do.  Any man willwho neglects the redemption of hisdead that he has power to officiate forhere.  When you get to the other sideof the veil, if you have entered intothese Temples and redeemed you pro-genitors by the ordinances of theHouse of God, you will hold the keysof their redemption from eternity toeternity.  Do not neglect this!  Godbless you.  Amen.The anthem,God of Israel hear our prayer,was sung by the choir.Benediction by Elder C. W. Penrose.Conference adjourned for six months.The stenographic work in takingthe account of the proceedings wasdone by Arthur Winter.JOHN NICHOLSON,Clerk of Conference. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' EUROPEAN PRINTING, PUBLISHING, AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42, Islington, Liverpool, June 10th 1893President Woodruff and Council Geo Q Cannon and Joseph F Smith Salt Lake CityDear Brethren I have received Your kind Letter informing me of the appointment of Apostle A. H. Lund to the Presidency of the European Mission Also giving me the privelege of remaining here longer in the mission or returning Home according to my better judgement. I would say in regard to that Section of Land I filed on, in Deseret, the time to prove up on it, expired last July, but my being in this Country Mr Hobbs the Land Agent kindly extended tohe time, for one Year, which will expire next month July, and I think it should be advertised one month in advance of proving up. takeing this in view, I thought if President Lund arrive, as we expect, I would leave here on the Alaska, Sailing Jun 17th. We have Ninety Six Scandinavian Emigrants, and about Thirty English, listed for that date, and five, or six, returning missionaries. We had four Elders as missionaries, arrive here per S S Nevada a few days ago all well, and were assigned their several fields of Labor their names are Elders Orson P Hoggan, John Burrows, John Wm Crookand George Thomas.

We Hope, and Pray, the Lord, will lengthen their days,that they may live to be a Blessing, and a Comfort, to His People, and to soon hear of their complete restoration to Health.I received a Letter from Elder George Reynolds, a few days ago, to purchase certain Arabic Books,which we set ourselves to accomplish.  We found all the Books called for, except the Calafagos, English and Arabic Dictionary, which we learned are out of Print, the next nearest to this, we were told is Salmones Dictionary, cost-ing, twenty eight shillings, each, of which we purchased two.  We also have purchased, six Vols, and index Vol, of Geikies Hours with the Bible, for ApostleF D Richards, we expect these Books, all to be delivered here, in the office tomorrow,and will have some of the returning Elders, who will leave for Home on the 20thtake them along with them, please inform Brother Richards of this.The following returning Missionaries, and Saints, will leave here on Saturday next May 20th, on the S S Alaska, under the charge of Joseph Christiansen,President of the Scandinavian Mission, T.

The Work of the Lord, progresses about as usual in these lands, some little interest being manifested in certain districts occasionally, there were Eleven Persons Baptized, in the Sheffield Conference last week.  Last Sunday, I attended the Irish Conference, held in Belfast, the progress of the Work is very slowon that Island, it is ^a^ hard matter to get anyone to listen to the Gospel Message, the Prostestant part of the Community, will sometimes receive the Tracks from the Brethren, but the Catholics are warned by the Priests, to have nothing to have nothing to do with them, and will often mob the Brethren out of their Streets, the Police advise the Brethren not to go among them, as they are not strong enough to protect them, there is a bitter feeling of Antagonism between the Catholics and Protestants around Belfast, rioting is very frequent, two of our Sisters who work in one of the Linen Factories, were speaking of fight, which occured a few weeks ago, in the factory they work in, between the girls, on the Home Rule question which lasted two weeks, no work being done in that time.  The Proprietors, nor Foremen, could do nothing with them, the Government had to arrest the leaders,and put them in prison.  Thirteen Missionaries for Great Britian arrived here last Sunday, on the Alaska, after a very pleasant Voyage, all being welland were each assigned their several fields of Labor.All the Brethren are feeling well, in the office, we had a very nice rainyesterday, which was very acceptable, it was the first to speak of since the 2ndof March, it is said such a drought has never been known in England beforePraying Our Heavenly Father to Bless You in Health, and Strength, and to Remember His Work, and Saints, in all the EarthI Remain Your Brother Alfred SolomonNewsy letter J.

Realizing alsohow wonderfully you have been preserved in the past.We feel sure it would be very gratifying to youif you could hear the many fervent and earnest prayersthat are offered up to the Throne of Grace, by our duskyfriends all over the Island, for God to bless, sustainand preserve you. For they, the Maories, have greatreverence and love for the Prophets and Apostles of Godliving upon the Earth to day.We have had translated intothe Maori language the communication from Prest.Woodruff to the Saints of God throughout the worldof August last.

 [sideways text]  Wm  PaxmanSept 2nd [18]87 [end of sideways text]Gisborne, Poverty BayNew ZealandSept 2nd 1887To the Counselors of our Deceased Prophet,and the Quoram of the Apostles.My Dearest Beloved BrethrenUpon my arrival at this place, after a fourmonths trip to the South and west part ofthis Island. I was pained indeed to receivewith my home mail, on the 27th  Ulto, thesad and Sorrowful intellegence of the Death ofpoor aged, avenerable and dearly beloved ProphetPresident John Taylor; realizing full wellthat ^at^ this critical period in our historythat his valuable Services could it bespared. But the Lord who controlsthe destinies of men and nations willnot Permit any thing to occur to ret-ard the progress of His work, and real-ize also that He can and will raise up ano-ther as great, good and noble as our belovedProphet who has been So recently called tolabor in another Sphere, to carry on Hiswork on the earth;Yet with all these assurances and theknowledge that we have of the merciesand loving kindness of our HeavenlyFather we cannot help but mourn fothe noble and illustrious dead, we,indeed, would be more than mortal ifwe felt otherwise;But thanks be toGod we have the hope and the assurance,that if we conduct our lives as becom-eth L. D. Saints that we will againmeet and clasp hands with that nobleSon of God, and that too where there willbe no longer the Power of darkness torule over and bind us in our endeavors 
 Prophet, Seer and Revelator.We had not contemplated writingto you by this mail, but for the returning home ofElder David Haight by the same steamer that takesthis to you.Elder Haight came here in comp-any with Elder Andrew Corry in January last. Sincethat time he has been endeavoring to acquire theMaori language. But owing to his memory beingso treacherous up to the present time he has not beenable to construct a single sentence in Maori. And hehas not been able to remember a passage of Scripture.Two weeks ago I received letters from him and thePresident of his DistrictJohn Ephraim Magleby  setting forth in plainness hiscondition. The natives are tired of him because he canneither speak in their language nor in English. Theyfeel that he should be assisted by the Lord as he isHis servant &c. He therefore and his President (Elder J.E. Maggleby) think it best for him and the Missionthat he return home. So in accordance with the re-quest I have released him to return home withElder William Gardner on Nov 7th. There is noplace in the Mission that I could place him to ad-vantage either to himself or the Mission. He feelsbad at having to return home in this condition andstates that he has fasted, prayed and wept over his con-dition. But finding no change for the better concludedhe had better take this course and return home where 
 to do good, but where all will be peaceharmony and love, where we can enjoythat Precious boon Liberty! and whereSatan will be bound, and those whoare taking Such a conspicuous Partin bringing the trials of to day uponthe People of God, will be reaping theirreward, they indeed will be objects ofPity when they get their just desertsfor bringing So much trouble uponthe chosen people of God,There is no doubtin my mind but that all Israelwould not have been called to mournSo Soon, had it not been for thePersecutions brought to bear against theleaders of Israel which forced them intoexile.He indeed was a double martyrand died a victim to this last vindict-ive and relentless raid which we are atPresent Subject to;  We are going tohold Suitable Services thr^ough^out this Missionon next Sunday the 4th inst, in affectionaterememberance of our deceased Prophet,The Elders and Saints all feel to mournwith the rest of the People of God, andoffer up earnest and united Prayers toHim that you my dear Brethren maybe abundantly qualified and Sustainedto carry on the work and Shoulder theresponsibility that now rests upon you.By the Same mail that broughtme the news of the death of PresidentTaylor, also brought the Painful newsof the death of my Son George Francis whowas at work on the Manti Temple.He was a good Son and died firm inthe faith, he was taken Sick verrySuddenly, and only lived four days after, 
 he felt he could do some good for himself and thecause of God. Elder Haight had some means to helppay his passage home. I have loaned him  15.0.0to make up the amount he was deficient with in-structions to call at the Historian's office and arrangefor the sending the amount to me Not knowing howyou would wish his fare paid under the circumstancesElder William Gardner has performed a verysuccessful mission of three and one half years and re-turns home in honor with my blessings and thoseof the Elders and Saints. He has presided over theWaikato District from its organization, which District, atthe late Conference held at Rakaumangamanga, onthe banks of the beautiful large Waikato River, wasdivided into three owing to its immense size. Thefollowing is the division. H. J. Manning Presidentand Alma Hayes Traveling Elder in the Waikato,H. J. Burgess President and Boyd Stewart TravelingElder in the Hauraki, Elias Johnson President andGeorge Romney Jr Traveling Elder in the Bay of Island.I am thankful to be able to state that there is quitean encouraging prospect in all three of these Districtsto reap a rich harvest of souls. During the past eightmonths there has been added to the Church in thisDistrict by Baptism and Blessing 108 souls. Quite anumber have been baptized quite recently and two newBranches organized. I feel that with the blessings ofGod a number of new Branches will be added 
 and leaves a wife and one sweet babe,This is quite a blow to me, but theLords will be done in this as inallother matters,Since having mailed mylast to Presidents John Taylor and Geo. Q. Cannoncontaining the news of our fellow laborerB. W. Young's Death, I have received aletter from them bearing date of June24th  and the inspired words thereincontained was most welcomely recei-ved and read, it is indeed verry grati-fying to know that the Heavens arenearer to us as a People than they haveever been before and that the Lord continuesto give unto His inspired Servants,Knowledge and wisdome from on high,It was also gratifying to hearthat the time seemed to be anopportune one for Utah to againknock at the door of Statehood, and thatProspects were so favorable and bright forher appear to be listened to and granted,the Lord grant that it may be so andthat we may have a little choice inthe matter of who Shall administerthe law unto us. The laws how--ever unjust we may think themif administered by men, the choice ofthe People and administered with equalityand justice will be quite a God givenboon to Suffering Zion.On my return from my travelsin the Southern Part of the Island Ifound Elders Ezra T. Richards and SandraSanders, as also Sister Katie in theenjoyment of good health, and enjoyingtheir labors upon the translation of theBook of Mormon,  I am thankful toState that they have translated up to 
 this summer.  Elder H. J. Sears has been released fromthe Waikato District and appointed to labor in theMahia District under Prest. M. S. Marriott. We feelthat the harvest is great and the laborours are fewElder George S. Taylor took steamer at Wellington onthe 1st of October for home going by way of England.Spring weather is now dawning upon us and itwill enable the Elders to get among the people withmuch greater ease, as the roads, in some parts arealmost impassable during our wet weather.An intelligent young manby the name of John Barton, a half caste, wasbaptized about three months ago. He has a goodEnglish education and has been employed by theGovernment as interpreter and translator. He man-ifests great interest in the work of God, and stateshis willingness to assist in the translation of theBook of Mormon free of charge. This I consideras quite providential, as we have been quite un-decided who to get to assist the Elders in goingover the work for the last time previous to writingthe manuscript for the printer, which work will com-mence about the 1st of December.The health of the Eldersand Sisters laboring here continues good and they allmanifest great earnestness in their labors. As a gen-eral rule are acquiring the Maori language quitereadily 
 the three hundredth Page of the preciousbook, and are laboring verry faithfullyfor the completion of the work.The Maori's are verry anxiousto have the work published, so thatthey can read its Sacred Pages, andare donating freely and librating of theirmeans to Support the brethern whilethus engaged, and look forward withgreat anxiety when they can read ofthe dealings of God with their fore-fathers.The health of the Elders is goodwith the exception of Elder H. J. Sears, thelast I heard from him he was notenjoying the best of health.Since my last letter to youthere has been no marked changes,there is a few being added to the Churchall the time. And the Elders con-tinus to Labor with an earnestnessand zeal that is quite commendible.We ever Pray for your Success andhappiness and a rich flow of theSpirit of God to attend you.With much love and best wishes to all, in which EldersE. T. Richards, S. Sanders, E. Johnson andF. H. Wright and Sister Katie joins.I remain your Brother inthe great course of truthWm Paxman 
 Since last writing you I have attended Conference inthe Tauranga District where I found Prest. A. W. Harperand Elder A. Bullock with the Saints rejoicing inthe work of God. We there had a time long to berememberedThere was an incident that occurredon our way that I think worthy of note. I in com-pany with Elder Johnson were coming through what isknown as the "ninety mile bush" when in turning oneof the rocky cliffs we came upon a little waterfalltrickling down the side of the mountain. The horseon which my companion was riding shied to oneside and he, seeing its proximity to the rocky chasm,dismounted and the horse fell over a cliff some fiftyfeet high mid a great heap of boulders. And kepton bounding down the side of the mountain somethree hundred feet. We at once went down and foundhim fastened in a thicket of underbrush. We at oncecut him loose and after several feeble attempts hegained his feet. The blood was pouring from his noseand was bruised and scared all over. In fourand one half hours we again gained the road andproceeded twelve miles farther that night. We attributeit to the hand of God and His Divine wactchcareover His Servants in the discharge of their dutiesIt will be about two months before Ireturn to Gisborne as I desire to accompany EldersH. J. Manning and H. J. Burgess to Taupo Lake and 
 surrounding country as there is a good prospect for a great work being done there. Elders Wm. Gardner,Elias Johnson and George Romney Jr who I amnow with join me in sending kind love to youand in praying God to bless you in your highand holy callingI remain your Brother in the greatcause of Truth.Wm Paxman[sideways text] W.

 Box 10.Gisborne, Poverty Bay, N. Z. Sept 24th 1887.To PresidentsGeo. Q. Cannon, Joseph F. Smith, Wilford Woodruff.My Dear Brethren:We have received this day two very interesting letters, one bearing date of August 2nd from Presidents Geo. Q Cannon and Jos. F. Smith, the other from President Woodruff, bearing date of August 16th;  and I now hasten to acknowledge the receipt of the same, for, the Lord being willing, we desire to leave on Monday morning for a visit to the North part of the Island and while thus traveling in Maoridom there is but little convenience or time for corresponding.We were delighted with the contents of your letters, and can say Amen to all the words spoken concerning the greatness and no-bility of character of our deceased leader and Prophet; but as you say his biography is interwoven with the history of this dispensation, and it is unnecessary for me to enlarge on his many noble qualities of heart and mind, all of which are so widely known, and inasmuch also as I wrote last mail my feelings to you regarding his death.We were much surprised and amused at the audacity, and brazen cheek of Uncle Sam in demanding $4,000,00000 of the Church.And for what? Is the Nation in a state of bankruptcy and do they wish to fill up their coffers with the hard earnings of the people of God whom they have driven and robbed before and some of whom they have killed? It seemes as though this step on the part of the Nation is too glaring an act for the people of the United States even to look upon without a feeling of insecurity for themselves and their denominations; for if they can thus rob us, they can in like man-ner rob them, should they happen to fall under the displeasure of an Edmond or a Tucker. But we do not fear the result, for we know that the Lord is on our side, and we have every thing to encourage us. This step against the work of God will, as has been the lot of all others, result in the complete overthrow of our enemies and the fur-therence of the cause they are seeking to destroy.We were thankful to hear that the People's Party came out and did their duty at the polls to the defeating of our Liberal candidates We think it high time that the Saints were arroused from the lethargy 
 that they have fallen into and be awakened to their duties in political as well as ecclesiastical matters, for they should have learned by the sad experiences of the past who are their friends, and that there is no movement adopted or sanctioned by the leaders of Israel but that which is for their good.We were rejoiced to hear of the safe arrival of Elder Correy.The draft that you mentioned of $600.00 came tafe [safe] to hand this mail to defray the passage expenses of Elder Correy and others, but am sor-ry to say that it was drawn on the bBank of New Zealand SydneyN. S. W., which will cause some delay and expense. All other drafts that have been sent have been on the Union Bank of Australia, at Gis-borne.Since writing you, I have received word from Elder Blyth in Australia that he has received from Brother Correy's the  30 that he borrowed for Elder Correy's return fare; I therefore shall use the ammount necessary to pay the  21 borrowed at Auckland for his "saloon" passage and hold remainder subject to your orders. I wrote you in a previous letter that Elder Blyth would not return until next Spring, as he desires to accompany some saints who will emi-grate at that time.I desire again to mention the progress being made in the trans-lation of the Book of Mormon by Elders Richards and Sanders, feel-ing greatly encouraged, as they have now got 374 pages completed; and if all is well and by the blessings of God, they anticipate finishing the work by the first of December next ready for going over it a second time and rewriting the manuscript for printing desiring to have it ready for the printer's hands by our next Gen-eral Conference in April. We are already enquiries of several firms concearning their terms for printing, binding, etc., that we may be able to lay the same before you in time to receive your counsel and instruction concerning the same.Since writing my last letter to you there has been no marked change in the Mission. The reports received from the Elders presiding over the various districts are to the effect that, generally, the Saints are feeling and doing well; but there are however, in all the districts therose who give way to their former loose lives, being overcome by adultery, which, I am sorry to say, is the leading sin in their midst.The health of the Elders is good so far as I know. Elder Geo. S. Taylor will leave for home next week, by way of England.(over) 
 Camebridge Waikato. N. Z.November 25th 1887President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake CityDear beloved BrotherToday on my arrival at this place,I received your most welcome andinteresting letter of the 13th of October,which had been forwarded from Gisborn to me. I am not able to discribe thejoy it afforded me in reading the contentsof the same, to hear direct from the leadersof Gods' Kingdom upon the Earth, inrelation to the interest and progress of thesame, and of the welfare of Gods insp-ired serveants in these trying and per-ilous times, what a time of rejoiceingit must have been to you, as also to theSaints, to have you with them at the lateConfrence, if only for one meeting, after such,a long time of seclusion, we were indeedsorry to learn that you had been so unwell 
 and Elder William Gardner in November. The weather still con-tinues quite unsettled, but anticipate fine weather soon. EEver praying for the blessings of God to rest upon you, and the members of the Apostles suited to your high and holy callings and your peculiar circumstances of to-day, and longing for the time when you can again mingle with the People.

 Gisborne Poverty BayP. O. Box #10 New Zealand January10th 1888President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City UtahDear Beloved Brother: It is by the kindness and blessings of Our Heavenly Father that we are permitted to ad--dress you in the enjoyment of health and strength, and I trust the spirit of this important mission, at this the commencement of another year, and I feel that we as saints can hail with joy each new year, knowing as we do know, that each one will bring about great changes for the good and welfare of the Israel of our God, and each one brings us nearer our redeemprtion, which God will surely give unto us in His own due time, and may this present one bring about liberty for the saints of God, if that would be for our best good.Your kind welcome and interesting letter of Nov 4th came duly to hand, and was read with great interest, as the great distance we are from head quarters, the leaders of God's people, makes a letter doubly welcome. We were indeed pained to learn of you having such a bad cold and cough, a [page torn] desire that long ere 
 this you have been restored to perfect health and strength to enable you to perform your many duties and labors, that are required of you in your high and holy calling.Elder H. J. Sears was released to return home by the December Steamer, but being disappointed in getting his passage money he did not leave Auckland for home until the 2nd inst. The check for $12500 for his return fare came safe and was forwarded to him. $15000 is the amount that has been sent for the previous Elders, until this time, which amount, if the church is able to continue sendingis we think little enough as in most cases it takes from $1000 to $2000 for them to reach Auckland, where owing to the time the Steamers run, they have to stay one week paying for their board, and in most every instance their clothes are to shabby for them to return home with.We are thankful to state that Elders J. J. Jackson for this Island, and Robert Lindsey and S. D. Chipman for Australia arrived at their fields of Labor in saf^e^ty, having had a good and pleasant voyage.The appointing of a receiver for the Church pro-perty, is indeed a new act in the great thieving drama of this powerful nation. Surely the wisdom of the wise has perished. It is very gratifying to us to know that the feel [page torn]mes outside of the 
 Territory is more micld towards us, as also to learn that there is not that vindictiveness on the part of the officials in our Territory, although I see that many of our bre--thern are being sent to prison.Was sorry to hear of the unusual dry season coming, so much severe sickness in the midst of the saints, but I trust winter with her storms has before this brought health to the homes of the saints.We rejoiced to learn of the good health of the Apostles, and do earnestly pray that it may contin-ue, that they may be the power in the hands of the Lord required at this important time in the history of the Church.Your kind mention of the translation of the Book of Mormon was thankfully received and we greatly desire to be able to fully put your kind suggestions into practice. At our last writing we thought that we had secured a good native assistant to help in the revision of the work, but for some cause he failed to come makeing a very slimsy excuse, we also obtained a promise from the second one, with the same results, this did not discourage us in the least for we knew that this was the Lords work and that He would raise up some suitable person for us, which we are thankful to say he has done in the person of Henare Ptae, one that has a thorough knowledge of the Maori language. 
 Hastings, Hastings District, Hawke's Bay, New ZealandHastings, Hawks Bay,New Zealand.April 12th 1888.President Wilford Woodruffand Quorum of Apostles,Dear Beloved Brethern:It is through a kind Providince, and a lovingFather, that we are once more permitted to addressyou by letter; and in doing so feel to offer up asilent, but fervent prayer that it may reach itsdestination, and find you all, in the full enjoymentof health, and under the Divine care and protectionof our ever kind and loving Father in Heaven; forwhen I reflect upon the present condition of your-selves and the Church, I see and feel that you needan increase of the power, wisdom and blessings ofGod; and to this end very earnest prayers are offeredup daeily, yea hourly, by the Elders and saints inthis far off land, the nethermost part of the earth.Fearing as we do, from the reports that reach us,from the various parts of Zion, that the saints havenot harkened unto the voice of God through His in-spired prophets, in honoring God, and setting theirhouses in order, and purging out sin and iniquityfrom their midst, which if done would have givenus unity and strength, so much so, that our enemieswould not have the power over us that they have today.

Richards and Sondra Sanders for with his assistance have just finished the revision of the first and second Books of Nephi, and we are most thankful to state, that the (Henari Potae) pronounces the trans-lation as being very good indeed, far better then he thought it could have been done and if this is the case of the first part of their work, it will be still better as they get further along, as they feel, that by the blessings of God, they improved much in the course of their labors, this mention is made to show that they were blessed and inspired of the Lord for the work they had been appointed and set apart to perform. We feel that when the revision is completed that there will be a very good and correct translation, one that will be quite plain, and will convey to the minds of the Maori people the meaning in the same plainness and simplicity and with the same accuracy, the glorious truths contained in that devine record, that our edition does to us. The Lord willing, we hope to have the revision com-pleted and the manuscript ready (or nearly so) for the printers by our annual conference which will commence on the 6th of April at Te Hauke, near Napier, at which there will be present the leading priesthood and saints of our dusky friends, (the Maori's), we then desire to lay before them the cost of printing and binding and adopt some 
 but thanks be to Our Heavenly Father, He has promisedto give us a glorious victory; to raise up one Mightyand Strong, to deliver us, in the appointed time.We pray God to bless you, and the faithfulwith patience, wisdom, and every needed blessing,until that happy times arrives.I am truly thankful to state that my healthis good, and I am rejoicing much in my labors,but, feel a little weary in body through the greatamount of labor that has been upon me during ourconference, which commenced on Friday the 6th, andclosed on Monday the 9th inst.    During the four days,twenty three meetings were held by the Saints, priesthoodand Elders from Zion; there being twenty five inattendance, and two Sisters, as also a large gatheringof the saints from the various parts of the Island;and above all the Lord Our God was with us bythe power of His spirit; to the great rejoicing of allthe saints, and Elders present.  In our councilmeetings we truly had a time never to be forgotten,for so great was the power and inspiration of Godpoured out upon us, that we shed tears of joy, andour hearts swelled within us for the goodness andloving kindness of our Heavenly Father thus bestowedupon us.  The saints of this district built a finemeeting house for the Conference, with seats, capableof holding three hundred people, the first house among 
 method of raising the means necessary to defray the expenses of the same, which we trust we will have no great difficulty in obtaining.In a former letter, it was stated, that we were obtaining prices for printing and binding, from the leading establishments in New Zealand, we have now received the same, and will here quote the best terms received, from the "Star Office", in Auckland, quite a large and reliable firm, having compositers that understand Maori, which is a great advantage, the prices quoted are for a book of 650 pages, size of leaf 5 x 7 inches, with good paper and type, a sample of each they have furnished us, they say.Our price for 2000 copies not more then 656 pages, bound in leather as per sample herewith inclosed would be  420.0.0d, for 1000 additional copies  150.0.0d If found in cloth (sample inclosed)   2000 copies  385.0.0d    1000 additional copies  125.0.0d     thus you see, that by having the 3000 copies, they will cost, in leather 3s-10d each or 95 cents, in cloth 3s-5d or 85 cents, these figures are 40 percent lower than any others we have received, and from the most reliableestablishment, and we think them very reasonable.Not knowing where you would desire the publishing to be done, here or in Zion, we take pleasure in forward-ing to you the afore figures, and will now wait your 
 the saints of this Island that has been furnished withseats; it was filled to its upmost capacity duringthe meeting of Conference, and their dusky faces beamedwith joy as they listened to the inspired words of the Servants of God, and those that had the privilege ofspeaking. During our meetings many expressed them-selves as being filled with joy and rejoicings for thethings they had heard, and the power they had felt,and desired to be firm and steadfast unto the end forthey knew it was the true Gospel, Ect.During the whole of our conference there was nothingoccured to mar our pleasure, or the peace of the company;all was love and good will.  Ample accommodationwere made for feeding and caring for the whole com-pany of not less then four hundred souls.  Quite anumber of these where outsiders, who had come tolisten to the truth.  It is no small affair to provideand care for a gathering of this kind, as all that comehave to be fed during the time of their stay, by thosewho live at the place of gathering.  It is done by freewill gifts, some making large presents of food; anon-member of the Church, brought a large van, drawnby four large horses some fifteen miles, containinga ton of flour, eight 40 lbs bags of sugar, a sack of rice,a box of tea, four sacks of shell fish, and a quantityof sweet and Irish potatoes.  I mention this to showthe liberality of the natives, in this respects, and the 
 instructions. We would be most thankful to receive any information from Brother Geo Q. Cannon, or others, in re-lation to the number best to print? the best method to ad-opt to obtain the required means? &c. We mention brother Cannon, because he has had an experiance with a sim-ular people and work, the printing and finding will take about one year.At our Conference in April, the following named Elders will be honorably released to return home to the bosom of the church and friends, having performed good, long faithful missions, Viz.Ezra F. Richards who has been here 3 1/2 years, the last year he has labored on the translation of the Book of Mormon, Francis H. Wright, Alfred W. Harper, Elias Johnson and John L. Blyth, who will have been here at the time of our conference three years, they have all presided over Conferences, and have done a good work, and will return home with honors, my blessings and the blessings of the Elders and saints.Please send the amoung for their return fares, ex-cept Elder Blyths, as his fare has already been sent, at your earliest convenience, on the Union Bank of Australia at Napier, as that will be the nearest to our conference, and the place from which the Elders will leave.We will also be pleased to have five or six Elders sent to this Island at your convenience, Young men 
 manner in which the large gathering was fed.For the accommodation of the Elders, a largetent was erected and a temporary table, sufficientlylarge to seat thirty persons, with plates, dishes &c.,to make it very pleasant, and the food furnishedus was extra good. The Elders greatly rejoiced athaving the opportunity of thus meeting together, itbeing thirteen months since our last general con-ference of the mission.We also had the pleasure of Elder John L. Blyth'scompany, who has been laboring in Australia forthe past three years, comparatively alone, in the midstof much opposition, and has by the blessings of Godsucceded in opening up the work in that partof the vineyard, organizing two branches &c.He is now on his return home to Zion, and willaccompany Elders, Ezra F. Richards, F. H. Wright,Elias Johnson, A. W. Harper and Alma Hayes, allof which, except the last names, have performedgood and faithful missions, laboring untiringlyfor the advancement of the cause of God, among thisstrange people; and they now return with an honor--able release, my blessings, and blessings of the Eldersand saints, and above these, the blessings of the Lord.Elder Hayes returns through sickness; his constitu-tion seems to be broken down.  He tells me thathe had two conjestive chills before he came here, 
 from 20 to 30 years of age are much preferable, as they can acquire the language much more readly, as also stand the climate & c the best, would like one or two of them suitable for teaching school.There are some few of our dusky friends that are becoming quite anxious about gathering home to Zion, About a year ago we wrote at some length about the emigration of this peculiar people, giving our opinion from what we had seen, about a suit-able place being selected for them, their mode of living &c &c. If you have any instructions upon this, and other matters we would be thankful to receive them by our confereance.We have recently returned from a three mounths trip to the north part of the Island, and are very thank-ful to be able to state that the great majority of the Saints, are endeavoring to live in accordance with the principles of the Gospel, and they manifest quite a love for the truth, as also for the servants of God, and awe are able to see a marked improvement in their con- dition, yet, there are those that become weary in the service of the Lord, and return back to the beggarly things of the world, adultry being the prevailing crime among them, but, generally when they are caught in the same, they will come forth and confess and seek to be restored in fellowship, they are very peculiar for this, so unlike the europeans. 
 and since his arrival in this land, he has had twosevere attacks of sickness, suffering much with hislungs.  For the last two months we have had himstaying with a kind family of europeans to be nursedup, but, in it all, he improves but little; he cannotride horse back, nor walk but a short distance, soit became neccessary to release him to return home.Elder Robert Lindsay, who was sent to Australialast nNovember has also got a constitution that hasbeen shaken badly by sickness and exposure in hisyouth.  Since his arrival in his field of labor hehas gradually failed in health, suffering muchfrom his lungs, until he got so weak that he couldnot walk around; yet, he has a great desire to fill anhonorable mission.  So he wrote to me, desiring tohave the privilige of going to his native land, Scotland,to visit his relatives, and there fill a mission.  I havereleased him to go and report himself to President GeorgeTeasdale at Liverpool, and have appointed A. L. Stewartto go and labor with S. D. Chipman, who has beenappointed to succeed Elder Blyth.Through the faithful and earnest labors of Elder'sEzra F. Richards and Sondra Sanders Jr., assisted bysome native helep, the revision of the translationof the Book of Mormon was completed in time topresent at our Conference; making it a little lessthen one year from the time of commencing the 
 During our trip, four new branches and two new conferences were organized, there were also quite a number added to the church by baptism, and since my return, Elders Elias Johnson and George Romney Jr,writes that they have added 42 others to the Church and organized another branch thus we are able to report the work of the Lord spreading among the branch of the house of Israel, to our great rejoicing.The health of the Elders is good, and with but few exceptions are making excelent progress in obtaining a knowledge of the Maori language, and those that have the language are laboring with a great perseverence among those not of our faith during the summer mo-nths, and we trust their labors will be crowned with abundant success.Since last writing, we have received some copies of the Epistle of the Apostles, which have been greatly enjoyed by us, and we can say a hearty amen to every sentiment and feel that such Epistles should be a great blessing to all Saints. We wait with great anxiety the arrival of each mail, feeling that im-portant changes can take place in a month, in these peculiar and interesting times, we are also quite in-terested in Utah being admitted into Statehood, ifthat is the will of our Heavenly Father, truly these are most peculiar times, yet, at the same time we are led to rejoice at seeing so visable the hand of God 
 translation.  To get it finished by this time, theyhad to work early and late.  Some portions of thetranslation was read at the conference, and pro-nounced by the best Maori linguist as being verygood and plain, 400 pages of the book is copied orrewritten ready for the press.  The work now re-maining, is to finish writing the manuscript and readit over before a suitable Maori.  Elder S. Sanders Jr.,have been appointed to this labor, assisted by sSisterKatie.  He has also been appointed to presideover this, the Hawks Bay district.  In presentingit to the conference, and calling upon the saints forthe means necessary for the printing and bindingof the same, it was not received with that spiritof liberality that we could have desired.This people have a great dread of being asked formeans, as they have been so badly duped andswindled by the former churches; stating, "thatthe ministers pointed to heaven with one handwhile they would steal their lands from under theirfeet with the other, yet, I have faith that the meanswill come from some quarters when needed.Elder John L. Blyth, seeing the feelings and con-dition of the people, was inspired to give  50 fiftypounds to assist in this noble work.  This means hisbrother gave him in Australia, to pay his fare home.I will enclose with this a Financial Statement 
 of means collected and expended, up to date of ourconference since which  18.8.0 have been collected,besides the  50 from Elder Blyth.  The great majorityof the people are very poor, and handle but little means.How the means will be collected I do not know,but, have faith that it will be forth coming in someway.  The feelings at conference, was to have 2000copies printed and bound.We much regretted that we detid not receive anyletter from you in answer to our inquiries, feel-ing as I do, that there had been a letter sent thatshould have reached us, but owing to some unknowncause it did not arrive.  I cannot tell how greatwas my disappointment, and those of the Elders.We shall take no action about the printing un-til we hear from you.   The remittance, for thereturn fares of the Elders, came safe, as also theamount sent in January for Elder Haight's returnEct.  Both drafts being in excess of the amountssent for.  That of Jany.  9.0.0 and the last  8.0.0making a total excess of  17.0.0 which amount Iwill use for the return fare of Elder Alma Hayes,with the additional sum of  13.0.0 which you willplease send to me at your convenience on the UnionBank of Australia at Napier. N. Z.This amount of  13.0.0 will balance our accountsup to date.  No doubt, but the fault is with me, 
 made bare in the defence of His covenant people, and in the overthrow of the powers of the earth, sur^e^ly Uncle Sam should turn his attention from Utah and her people, to the fearful internal workings of his own people, who are preparing to lay waste every City, town and hamlit and bring destruction and death to his people, the saints can well afford to wait the Lords time in all things.We are deeply interested in your welfare, and that of the Apostles, knowing the powers that are brought to bear against you, and of the great responsibilityies resting upon you, earnest prayers continually ascend unto Our Father and God, for His power, wisdom and guidance to be with you, and all the leaders of Israel.Elders Ezra F. Richards, Sondra Sanders Jr, F. H. Wright and Angus T. Wright as also sister Paxman and Sister Marriott, who is writing the manuscript ready for the printers, write with me in profound love to you and the quorum of the Apostles.Again stating that we will be most happy to hear from you, and carry out any council you may be led to give.I remain your Brother and colaborer in the great cause of TruthWm Paxman

Woodruff andQuorum of Apostles.Dear Beloved Brethren;Your kind and much appriciatedletter of ^the^ 3rd of April came duly tohand, and was read with deepinterest, and I now fear that Iwas not considerate enough ofyour many labors, expectingan answer to mine in so shorta time, if so, it was from thegreat desire I had to hear fromyou before our conference, andoften in our anxiety we do notcarefully weigh the surroundingsas we should before we Jump atconclusions. Therefore I beg to beexcused, and hope to exercise morepatience in the future.

 P. S. Jany 16thSince writing the above we have just re-ceived your very interesting and instructive letter of the 12th of Dec 1887. We were thankful to learn of your improved health, as also the good health of the Apostles. It is also most gratifying to know that the Lord has so wonderfully preserved the leaders of Israel from imprisonment, while such strenuous effort are being made to capture them, surely we are led to praise God all the day long.It truly is a "day of shaking" and one that is increasing the faith of the saints in the living God, and preparing us for the day of seperation, draw-ing the deviding line. What a consolation to know that Our Heavnly Father, Joseph, Hyrum, Brigham and John with all the holy Prophets and Apostles that have lived upon the earth, is on our side, and will advocate our cause, and bring about our deliverance in the appointed time of the Lord.We watch with great interest the movements of the Receiver and of our enemies, through the medium of the Deseret News, and feel that Zion has much to be thankful for.You will please find inclosed the statement asked for. I find that to get the returns in time for the returning Elders, it will be necessary to answer this by the return of mail, which leaves 
 We were delighted to hear of thegood health prevailing in yourmidst, and sincerily desire andpray, that the same may continue.Your kind discription of BroGeo Q Cannons labors upon thetranslation of the Book of Mormoninto the Hawaiian languagewas verry interesting indeed.And we will here state that wehad access to two good Nativeschoars, to ask for informationand explanations during the timeof translation, as also during therevision, and since receiving yourmuch appreciated letter, we havesecured (3) three excelent Natives toassist in the reading overcarefully of the manuscript. Allthree are good in the Maori, andtwo excellant in the english 
 languge; And coming asthey do from different parts of theIsland, we feel that it will comeforth the best that it can; forwe will indeavor to carry outyour instructions to our ut-most. These Brethren areJ.A. Jury a half east, PiripiTe Maari, and Hakopa Ratama.The two first are men of  moreof means and influence, andthey have given me to understandthat they would come to myassistance with their means,so that the printing might bedone as soon as possible. Theyare also anxious that (3,000)three thousand coppies should beprinted instead of 2,000, asvoted upon at our conference, asI have already wrote you.

 Since which time he hashad several hard spells ofsickness, mostly upon hislungs, but now he has thereheumatism as well. He informsme that he has sufferd withhis lungs for seven years beforehe came here. He has man-ifested great anxiety to stayand fill his mission, fastingand praying, and receivingthe ordinance of the layingon of hands, but he has notreceived any permanent releief,but has yet got quite sick, so Ihave deemed it best to releasehim to return home by thissteamer that will carry thisto you. I wish to say inhis justifycation that he hasbeen exceedingly diligent in

 Elders and Sisters from Zionas far as I now know is goodwith the exception of colds, whichis quite previelent at this seasonof the year; so many changesof the climate in one day, andso much wet. The Eldersare laboring with great diligence, But during the winter theycannot do as much, as in someparts, the roads are almost im-passable; In a letter receivedyesterday from Elder GeorgeRomney Jr, he stated that thehorses were scarcely able to getthrough the mud with their bl-ankets etc, they having to walk,much of the roads are only bridle paths, upon clay ground, throughtimber and brush. There isgeneral good health prevailing 
 in the midst of the saints, asalso an increased desire to live theprincyples of truth. Yet we havecontinualy some cases of sin tocause us to grieve, for this peopleare so prone to go astray, muchlike the children of Israel. Inow know how to sympathisewith that great Prophet, "Moses,"in his tryials. I donot blamehim for getting righteouslymad and breaking the tablets, ##Exodus 32:19##although I am thankfull tostate that I have not had toget verry mad, but it do requiregreat wisdom and patience;which I have not only as theLord give it me. Since Ilast wrote you, in companywith Elders John W. Kauleina-moku, and N. S. Bishop, I have 
 made a visit through theWairarapa district, holdingconference there, and then wetravelld around the west coastvisiting many places of thosenot in the church, holdingmeetings with them. Andwe are now in the Mananwatudistrict where we will holdConference next Saturday andsunday. We have Just beenintroducing Elder Kauleina-moku into this new district,feeling that by the blessings ofthe Lord he will open up a goodwork around the west coast;as there are many Maoriesliving upon the same. Hehas been apointed to preside overthis district of country. TheElders now on their way here 
 will land on or about the 20thWe are greatly in need of them,and sincerly hope they will beable to indure this climate, anddo a good work. It wasmost gratifying to learn that theroof would be placed on the Tem-ple in Salt Lake City this presentseason. I was also much de-lighted to learn of the homeindustries of Z. C. M. I. asthese things are verry pleasingto me. news of your late con-ference has reached us and readwith great interest, especialyso the epistle, drinking in everysentance of the same. In re-lation to Statehood, we wouldrejoyce if we could obtain that^great^ boom, but Father controols thosethings, and it will be all right 
 either way. By the paperswe see the raid against thesaints of God still go on withrenewed diligence, it shurelyshould cause the saints to turnunto their God with full purposeof heart. You will pleaseexcuse brevity as there is solittle accommodations forwriting while travellingamong our dusky friends.I will write more full atsome future time.Elders J. W. Kaulei-namoku. N. S. Bishop, andDavid Muir, who I am nowwith, join with me insending profound love, andpraying for the your welfareand prosperity in the Kingdomof God. I remain your

Woodruff andQuorum of Apostles,Much beloved Bretheren,We feel that we are greetly blessed;to have this another opportunety of addressing a letter to you, and especi-aly so, to be in receipt of another of your esteemed favors, bearing the date of July 19th, which came safe to hand; as also the receipt in favor of Charles Hardy for ( 10) ten pounds, donation donation to the Manti Temp-le. Also a check for ( 15) fifteen pounds, the balance of the return fair of El-der Meacham; In reading your much appricated letter, we could not help but feel in part the great anxiety and burden that rests upon you, in these most trying times; and the feelings of our hearts go out unto our Kind 
 loving Father in Heaven, for His power and blessings to be ever with you; It was very gratifying to us, to learn th-at there was a fair prospect of a [uecuring] the Holy temples, meeting houses and other Sacred places, from the hands ^of the^ wicked.God to grant that it may be so overruled. We will be much pleased to learn of the success of Elder Jos. H. Deen upon the Samoin Islands, for we feel with you, that there are many of the inhabitance of these Islands that will receive the Gospel, was sorry to learn of the severe dry summer you had had in Utah; By this last mail a draft came for the return fair of Elder S, Sanders, H. J Man-ning and M. S. Marriott & wife Elder S. Sanders having comepleated his labor upon the M ss of the book of Mormon, returned home by the Sept Steamer I borrowed  30 for his return fare and find by the draft that only  25 each has been sent. The other two 
 Elders and Sister Marriott, will return home in Nov next, and my wife Katie will also accompany them, as she is near-ing the time of her confinement, and there are no conveniances for women to pass through that ordeal in Maoridum She has preformed a good faithful laboras a missionary, with out offering the least complaint, we feel that she can return home quietly and be quite safe, with her Parents. I will have to borrow the means for her return fare, which you will please send to me on the Un-ion Bank of Australia, of Auckland at your earliest conveniance. For some some cause I have not yet received only a part of my mail that came by the last Steamer, so do not know whether there was a letter from you or not, but think prehaps there is, as the draft came and I feel much disapointed that it has not come to hand. I am thankful I am than to be able to state that my 
 health is good, and that I am feeling splendid splendid in my labors. Sometimes I get quite tired and sore, but what of that, it is in a good cause. It is with much pleasure that we inform you, of the delivery of the Mss of the Book of Mormon, in Maori into the printers hands in Auckland, on the 4th of Sept, to have two thousand cop-ies printed, and bound in leather, that being as many as we could execrcise faith in having printed at this time; for at a conference held just before we sent the M-SS to Auckland, there was a strong feeling manifested by the Native breathren, not to have it printed now feeling that they could not raise the means required for the payment of the same, but, by the power of blessings of God, and laying before them, that it was Gods Holy book, that had been held in reserve to come forth in the fulness of times, to give them an understanding of their foreFathers, and the pure Gospel of Christ.

Yet in so doing we feel to offer upa silent, though fervent prayer to our loving Father inHeaven, that this may reach you in safety, and findyou in the full enjoyment of health and every blessingof the Lord suited to your high and holy callings, andthe great labors devolving upon you at this peculiarperiod in the history of the Church.How we were made to rejoice and praise the Lordour God for the good news that came to us by the lastmail, viz., the freedom of Pres Woodruff and Cannon, af-ter so long a confinement, to again mingle with andinstruct the Saints of Israel in the great things of God;feeling as we do that it has not come any too soon forthe good and welfare of Zion; for when the shepherdsare absent, the flock is apt to become more or less affected.We feel that a reformation will now take place in themidst of the Saints, and all Israel will be made to 
 And sho^w^ing unto them that they would not be any better prepaired in one or two years from now, then they are at this time, and that there was great danger in delays, etc, they consented to have the work go on at once, and subscribed means enough to make the first pa-yment of  150 0 0, the next payment of the same amount is to be made when the printing is half done, and the remainder of  120 0 0 on the complecian of the work, they, the prin-ters are under a contract to do their work according to agreement and sp-eciments, etc, and I am under contract to make the payments as they becom due, and I have faith that the Lord will open up the way if we do our part faithfuly, the work is to be finished by our general confrence next April; We feel that the Bk of Mormon will be the means of bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, and 
 rejoice, both at home and abroad.While you were, with the many Saints rejoice-ing in conference in Salt Lake City, we also wererejoicing in our annual ^conference^, which has just closed atthis place, and at which were in attendancethirty one of the Elders from Zion, as also a large at-tendance of our dusky friends from all the districts,except that of Tauranga. Great were the rejoicingsof all present, as the spirit of God was so abundantly^bestowed^ upon both speakers and hearers, and many werethe words of inspiration that were spoken duringthe five days that we were together, two of whichwere occupied by the Elders in council, in which wewere one and all melted to tears of joy as greatwas the spirit of God that was in our midst causingeach one to arise to his feet and praise the living God;for we ^were^ enabled by the power of his Holy Spirit to testify[t]hat He is our Father and that we are His delegatedsons, the embassadors of our Lord Jesus Christ. Everyselfish feeling that might have been in our heartswas swallowed up in the love of God, and we wereled to rejoice much that our lot has been cast uponthis island to labor among this benighted and sinfulpeople, a portion of the House of Islrael. They havesuch faith in a Supreme being, as also in the Bible,that many of them are led to receive the truths of 
 breaking down some of the strong bariors that we now have to contend with, in the Shape of Maori prophets, who are leading many into sin, and disbelief in the bible, there fore our great anxiety to have it printed at once. Our Statistical report for the six months ending July 31st show an increas of eighty baptisms and twenty children blessd, over that of the same period of last year, for wh-ich we are led to praise God, and we have still bright prospects for the future, as we generally do much better during the Summer then the winter months. The health of the Elders is now good as far as I have learnt. Elders George Romney Jr and David Muir have both been quite unwell with bad colds, but are feeling well again, for which I feel very thankful. Since my last letter to you I have visited six districts, attendid conferences in the same, and it is most gratifying to me to be able to state 
 the Gospel soon as they hear them, for they see that they areprecisely the same as taught by Christ and His apostles.And many, very many others would receive thesame if it were not for the power exercised by thechiefs ofver the various tribes. This power howeverwill sooner or later be broken down as that every hon-est soul may rejoice in the truth. We see a great changein the respect in ^during^ the past three years, for whereverthe Gospel is received, it does away to a great extentwith their feelings of cheifship, or desires to keepothers in subjection. This was quite marked dur-ing our conference, as we had quite a number ofleading cheifs in attendance, yet they were humbleas children and one with the Saints in all things.And we were also made to rejoice in beholding the great improvment the Saints are making in know-ledge and faith in the Gospel, as also their personalapperanance and deportment, and willingness tohearken unto counsel.One of the leading features of the conferenceand one that gave great joy unto the Saints, was hav-ing five hundred copies of the Book of Mormon inMaori, to distribute amongst them. Never were chil-dren more anxious to receive their Christmas pres-ents, than were this people to receive that holy book.And although nearly all present had paid from five 
 that I find a good spirit prevailing am-ong the Saints, and fully as much improved, as we could naturally expect, after so long a training in sin and every visious habit. I feel that they are doing wonderfully well, as we are able to to see the advancements made by them through traveling and mingling with those not in the Church, as I have to do in traveling from one district to another. I am pleased to State, that wh-ere-ever we go we have the priveledge of holding meetings and beering testim-ones to the truth of the Gospel, and warning the people of the great day of God, for it is seldom that I do not hold from eight to ten meetings a weak and often more then that. We are organiazing Sunday schools in many of the branches, and we find they have a verry benefical offect, for great interest is taken in them, by yo-ung and old, and when we receive the- 
 Kiri Kiri, N. Z.July 11th 1889President Wilford Woodruff, And Counselors.Much beloved Brethren, We are just in receipt of your long and most interesting epis-tle of the 23rd of May, And now hasten to pen a few lines in reply. Seeing that it arrived too late for us to return by the present mail Steamer, that you may know that it was received, as also of our moove-ments. But it will necessarly have to be brief for the lack of time, as we are now trav-ling through the district, holding conferences.We had learned by the pre-vious mail, of the Organ-azation of the First Presidency 
 shillings (the price of a book) to five pounds and upwards,and were entitled to receive copies without any fur-ther payments, yet so great was their joy, thatabout eighty paid for their books five shillings eachsaying that they had joy in so doing, as it was theirdesire to assist in raising the balance yet due on thefinal payment that there might be a fund on handfor the publishing of other works, as they desire torecieve all that God has revealed for the guidanceand blessing of His children. When I was set apart for this mission, among other great promisesand blessings that were pronounced upon me, wasthat means nescessary to carry on this work shouldbe raised in a mysterious manner, and surely thishas been the case from the commencement until thistime, for most of the means have come in quite a mys-terious manner, and as the payments have becomedue just enough to pay them has been forthcoming,and for the last payment the Saints have exceededour most sanguine hopes or expectations. With thisa statement will his furnished showing the receiptand disbursements and balance on hand which I feelwill be most gratifying, for beside the balance of 80.12.5 we have collected  18.3.6 for the sale of booksmaking a total of  98.15.11 so that all that is lackingis about fifty pounds. 
 printed matter matter in Maori that the Deseret Sunday School Union have so kindly consented and agread to furnish us, we look for a still greater interest to be taken and much more good to be accomplished; Our day schools are doing well, the Saints testify that the children are learning much faster then they do in the Government sch-ools.It now become my painful duty, to refer to that which is not so pleasant, and I am sure it will cause you feelings of sorrow, as it had done my-self and Elder Wright.I will inclose a letter wrote by [redacted text][redacted text] to President Woodruff, which will in part, explain it self, this was wrote with the intention of sending it direct, and wait 
 during the April Conference, And felt greatly to rejoice in the same. And will say, that the brethren thus sustained met with our hearty appr-oval and support, knowing as we do know, that they are the right men, in the right place.Your kind and inspiring letter afforded us much ple-asure in reading the same, to learn of your good healthas also of your travels and labors among the saints. As we realiaze that they will result in great good. It was most gratifying to learn that Nephi received a vissit from you, and were premitted once more to listen to your inspiring words of council, and trust the saints will receive them, 
 You will also be most gratified to note the in-crease of souls during the past year. From statisti-cal report inclosed you will see that 573 have beenbaptized and 230 children blessed, making a total of 743which is an increase of 237 over and above the year pre-vious. There have also been two districts or conferences or-ganized and fifteen branches, also ^22^ Sunday Schools, whichwith the large sum of money raised for the printing ofthe Book of Mormon, and that important work havingbeen nearly completed, we are filled with thanksgivingand praises unto the Lord our God; knowing as we doknow, that it has all been accomplished by His divineguidance and wisdom, and as poor weak mortals wedo not desire to take the least praise unto ourselves; ful-ly realizing that we have done no more than our duty.But by His aid and blessings we have sought to mgag-nify our most high and holy callings as embassa-dor of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, and fully real-ize that we have been wonderfully blessed and sustain-ed, having enjoyed the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.It is also most gratifying to us to be able to statethat the prospects for the future are very encouragingindeed, and by the aid that we feel that the Book of Mormonwill begin aiding in the spreading of the Word of God,we feel that there will be a rich harvest of souls. Al-ready there have ^been^ over one hundred added to the fold 
 For an answer, but, after writ-ing the same, he laid the sad affair before Angus. T. Wright, the President of his dis-trict, and, handed him the inclosed letter to read; he at once forbade him acting in any of the ordenances of the Gospel, and partaking of the Sacrement.Upon inquiry, I learned that he had first committed him-self with a married woman about six years ago, who had received her endowments. After that, he repented for three years, but, on reading, that an adulturer could enter into the Celestial Kingdom of God, he became reckless, and let his passions run wild with him, up to within three

 months of him being call-ed upon this mission.Feeling that I had no rightto handle his case here, andthat we could not keep thenatives from having sus-picions, seeing that hecould not act in his calling,I have released him toreturn home by the same Steamer that [has]this to you. And havecounciled him to see oneof the Apostles, and lay before him his sad andpainful affair.I trust in this I have doneright, as, I would muchdislike the natives to learn the nature of this case, has theynow have every confidancein the servants of God, 
 but if no further word are sent to us, we will appoint and set apart the one you men-tioned in your letter.And leave for our dear moun-tain home on the 12th of August, the Lord willing, and will be in S. L.

 since the date of the report.The Elders are all quite well and enjoy a mostexcellent spirit and are returning to their variousdistricts feeling that this has been by far the best con-ference ever held in this mission. In their appoint-ments and ^our^ council meetings there was not a mur-mur or a dissenting voice, but all expressed them-selves as feeling assured that the Lord had directedin all things. Five of the six Elders that left inMarch for this field of labor arrived in safety, werein attendance at our conference, and have nowbeen assigned to their fields of labor. I like their ap-pearance much, and think they are well adaptedfor this mission. One of their number, Elder Geo.T. Smith, returned from San Francisco on account ofpoor health. While speaking of the Elders still saythat we feel blessed in having such a good faith-ful and obedient lot of boys, for such I call andclaim them to be.Much might be said of our conference, thelarge gathering, quantity of food consumed, kind-ness of those not in the church, etc. but as a full re-port will be furnished the Deseret News I will nottake your valuable time by relating those itemshere: will simply say that the weather and all per-taining to the same was delightful.

Alexander Bullock who has been here two years, a good faith-ful man over fifty years of age. He has not beenable to acquire the language, but has done all thegood that laid in his power. And H. J.

I willborrow the means for them, unless you have kindlyresponded to our last letter regarding the paymentfor the Book of Mormon. If so that can be used.We have also directed Elder Wm Bromley to returnhome with Elder A. L.

 Elders N. S. Bishop and J. W. Platt will also return with me, as they have been here three years. For their return fares as also for my own, I will use  90 of the  100 you so kindly loaned to us, for thefor the final payment of the printing of the Book of Mormon in Maori.Elder George Romney Jr has also been here near three years, and it will soon be time for his release, so please send a draft on the Union Bank of Australia, at Auck-land, for  30 in favor of Angus.

The understanding was that his brother,whom he went to see, would pay his return farebut not having heard from him I do not knowhow it will be.There continues to be quite an enquiry amongour dusky friends about their emigrating to Zion,feeling that they desire to get to the land of theirforefathers when the Prophet and apostles and theholy temples are &c. We tell them to be patient,that this matter is before you, and in the due time of the Lord the word will come for them togather. This seems to satisfy them for a time, andthen like children they will spring the same questionagain.The hireling priest of the day, both Europeanand Native, are becoming quite alarmed aboutus, the Elders, being in their midst; and at aconference just held at the Bay of Islands, atwhich there were three archbishops present, theygot up a petition with many signatures, andsent to parliament asking for a law compell-ing us to return, ^or leave the island,^ and hindering any others fromcoming: setting forth that we are destroying thepeace of the people; that before we came theywere united in religious matters, but nowwe are causing them to leave the church of their

Yet, I am led to praise the Lord that I have been inspired of Him to do as 
 I have, and that I am able to see so much fruit of my feeble efforts, I have sought to be dilligent in traveling and in raising my voice in the defence of truth.And I now rejoice that I can return with the sanction and blessings of my file leaders, and I feel with the blessings of the Lord.It will be quite necessary to have (6) six more Elders sent to their field as soon as possible, and if two of the number, that has some tact as school teachers, could be sent, to take the place of those now teaching school, it would be splended, as they are needed to travel, as soon as they acquire the language,

Those that have been baptized into the churchdo not turn out well as a general rule. Thereis far more pleasure in laboring among theMaories with all their weaknesses and pecul-iarities.During the conference it was thought bestto hold two conferences each year one in theNorth and one in the South of the island becauseof the great distance to be traveled.

 manifestations of His power inthe healing of the sick, manyof which have been healedinstantaneously, the casting outof evil spirits, the breakingdown of strong barriers, thepreparing the minds of thepeople for the Gospel, the rais-ing up of friends to ad-minister unto us etc. All ofwhich fill our hearts with joyand rejoices and make us feel,more than ever before, like doingall in our power to bless ourfellow men, and establish uponthe earth those correct principlesthat have been again revealedfrom the Eternal world forthe salvation of the children ofmen. Realizing at the same 
 rejoice both at home and abroad.While you were, with the many Saints rejoic-ing in conference in Salt Lake City, we also were rejoicing in our annual ^conference^ which has just closed at this place, and at which were in attendance thirty one of the Elders from Zion, as also a large at-tendance of our dusky friends from all the districts, except that of Tauranga. Great were the rejoicings of all present, as the spirit of God was so abundantly ^bestowed^ upon both speakers and hearers, and many were the words of inspiration that were spoken during the five days that we were together, two of which were occupied by the Elders in council, in which we were one, and all melted to tears of joy, so great was the spirit of God that was in our midst causing each one to arise to his feet and praise the living God: for we ^were^ enabled by the power of his Holy Spirit to testify [t]hat He is our Father and that we are His delegated sons, the embassadors of our Lord Jesus Christ. Every slelfish feeling that might have been in our hearts was swallowed up in the love of God, and we were led to rejoice much that our lot has been cast upon this island to labor among this benighted and sinful people, a portion of the House of Israel. They have such faith in a Supreme being, as also in the bBible, that many of them are led to receive the truths of 
 time how very weak we are, andthe necessity of leaning uponthe Lord for strength, wisdomand qualification necessary for us.Your esteemed favors of Aug-ust 20th and Sept 17th came dulyto hand and were read with the usual deep pleasure and interestWe were caused to rejoice tolearn of the good health pre-vailing in your midst andthe desires of our hearts arethat you may continue onthe enjoyment of the sameblessings.It was indeed a greatsurprise to us to learn of OurBeloved Brother George Q. Cannongiving himself up to the Gov-ernment officials and still more 
 the Gospel soon as they hear them, for they see that they are precisely the same as taught by Christ and His apostles. And many, very many others would receive the same if it were not for the power exercised by the chiefs ofver the various tribes. This power however will sooner or later be broken down so that every hon-est soul may rejoice in the truth. We see a great change in this respect in ^during^ the past three years, for wherever the Gospel is received, it does away to a great extent with their feelings of chiefship, or desires to keep others in subjection. This was quite marked dur-ing our conference, as we had quite a number of leading chiefs in attendance, yet they were humble as children, and one with the Saints in all things. And we were also made to rejoice in beholding the great improvement the Saints are making in know-ledge and faith in the Gospel, as also their personal appearance and deportment, and willingness to hearken unto counsel.One of the leading features of the conference and one that gave great joy unto the Saints, was hav-ing five hundred copies of the Book of Mormon in Maori, to distribute amongst them. Never were chil-dren more anxious to receive their Christmas pres-ents, then were this people to receive that holy book. And although nearly all present had paid from five

 shillings (the price of a book) to five pounds and upwards, and were entitled to receive copies without any fur-ther payments, yet so great what is their joy, that about eighty paid for their books five shillings each saying that they had joy in so doing, as it was their desire to assist in raising the balance yet due on the final payment that there might be a fund on hand for the publishing of other works, as they desire to receive all that God has revealed for the guidance and blessing of His children. When I was set apart for this mission, among other great promises and blessings that were pronounced upon me, was that means necessary to carry on this work should be raised in a mysterious manner, and surely this has been the case from the commencement until this time, for most of the means have come in quite a mys-terious manner, and as the payments have become due just enough to pay them, has been forthcoming, and for the last payment, the Saints have exceeded our most sanguine hopes or expectations. With this a statement will be furnished showing the receiptand disbursements in balance on hand which I feel will be most gratifying, for beside the balance of  80-12-5, we have collected  18-3-6 for the sale of books making a total of  98-15-11 so that all that is lacking is about fifty pounds. 
 You will also be most gratified to note the in-crease of souls during the past year. From statisti-cal report inclosed you will see that 513 have been baptized and 230 children blessed, making a total of 743 which is an increase of 237 over and above the year pre-vious. There have also been two districts or conferences or-ganized and fifteen branches, also ^22^ Sunday Schools; which with the large sum of money raised for the printing of the Book of Mormon, and that important work having been nearly completed, we are filled with thanks giving and praises unto the Lord our God; knowing as we do know, that it has all been accomplished by His divine guidance and wisdom, and as poor weak mortals we do not desire to take the least praise unto ourselves; ful-ly realizing that we have done no more than our duty. But by His aid and blessings, we have sought to mgag-nify our most high and holy callings as embassa-dors of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, and fully real-ize that we have been wonderfully blessed and sustain-ed, having enjoyed the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.It is also most gratifying to us to be able to state that the prospects for the future are very encouraging indeed, and by the aid that we feel the Book of Mormon will be in aiding in the spreading of the Word of God, we feel that there will be a rich harvest of souls. Al-ready there have ^been^ over one hundred added to the fold 
 we would gladly travel manymiles to have the blessedprivilege of seeing and hearingthe Apostles of Christ.The Elders mentioned by youarrived at Auckland on the 10thinst in the enjoyment of healthhaving had a pleasant voyagesave the first day out fromSan Francisco, which was quiterough. Father Bromley looks quiteaged and feeble for such a longjourney. Yet he was feeling aswell as could be expected. Theywere appointed to labor as fol-lows: John H. Timpson, Waikato;Latimus O. Taft, Poverty Bay;Hugh S Geddes, Mahia;Joseph P. Beck, Hawkes Bay;We like their appearance much 
 and feel that they will makegood missionaries. Elder GeoE. Woolley felt some what castdown, on parting, with hisbrethren to continue his journeyto Australia. Judging from the shorttime I spent with him, I thinkhim a fine young man andspeak for him a useful lifethrough humility.By some means the Eldersdid not bring the tracts youstated would be sent to us.We sincerely hope they will comeby the Elders now on theirway here. It was very gratify-ing to receive instructions concern-ing the emigration of the "Maories"For we have written three timeson the same subject without 
 since the date of the report.The Elders are all quite well and enjoy a most excellent spirit and are returning to their various districts feeling that this has been by far the best con-ference ever held in this mission. In their appoint-ments and ^our^ council meetings, there was not a mur-mur, or a dissenting voice, but all expressed them-selves as feeling assured that the Lord had directed in all things. Five of the six Elders that left in March for this field of labor arrived in safety, were in attendance at our conference, and have now been assigned to their fields of labor. I like their ap-pearance much, and think they are well adapted for this mission. One of their number, Elder Geo.T. Smith, returned from San Francisco on account of poor health. While speaking of the Elders Iwill say that we feel blessed in having such a good faith-ful and obedient lot of boys, for such I call and claim them to be.Much might be said of our conference, the large gathering, quantity of food consumed, kind-ness of those not in the church, etc. but, as a full re-port will be furnished the Deseret News I will not take your valuable time by relating those items here: will simply say that the weather and all per-taining to the same was delightful. There was 
 nothing occurred to mar the peace and happiness of those present; but felt that we were in the enjoyment of the same Spirit that was with you in your con-ference.You will please send a remittance of nine-ty pounds ( 90)on the Union Bank of Australia at Auckland for the return fares of Elders A. L. Stewart now laboring in Australia, who has not enjoyed the best of health during the two years he has been here, and we do not think it best wise to keep him here over another of the wet winters of Australia as his lungs and kidneys seem affected. Alexander Bullock, who has been here two years, a good faith-ful man, over fifty years of age. He has not been able to acquire the language, but has done all the good that laid in his power. And H. J. Burgess who has filled a faithful mission of 2 3/4 years. The two first named will most likely return in May, with a small company of Saints from Auckland. I will borrow the means for them, unless you have kindly responded to our last letter regarding the payment for the Book of Mormon. If so that can be used.  We have also directed Elder Wm Bromley to return home with Elder A. L. Stewart from Aust[ralia]. feeling that it would not be best for him to remain here over winter in his advanced age, he being over seventy 
 receiving any word until now. Wedid not know what answer togive to those so anxious to gather.But now, we feel that they willbe quite reconciled for a time,to wait until that suitable placeis selected for them. We will pre-sent it to them in the bestlight possible. We are sorry tohave to report another case ofhostility. This time it was withthe native Saints and not the Elders.Yet it occured at the sameplace that Elders Johnson andMagleby were tied up and keptprisoners for two days. Thechief and some of the leadingmen at this village are verybitter enemies to the Church.And recently some of his people 
 years old. The understanding was that his brother, whom he went to see, would pay his return fare; but, not having heard from him I do not know how it will be.There continues to be quite an enquiry among our dusky friends about their emigrating to Zion, feeling that they desire to get to the land of their forefathers where the Prophet and Apostles and the holy temples are, &c. We tell them to be patient, that this matter is before you, and in the due time of the Lord, the word will come for them to gather. This seems to satisfy them for a time, and then like children they will spring the same question again.The hireling priest of the day, both European and Native, are becoming quite alarmed about us, the Elders, being in their midst: and at a conference just held at the Bay of Islands, at which there were three archbishops present, they got up a petition with many signatures, and sent to parliament asking for a law compell-ing us to return, ^or leave the islands,^ and hindering any others from coming: setting forth that we are destroying the peace of the people; that before we came they were united in religious matters, but now we are causing them to leave the church of their

So when theyreturned to their homes some ofthe people, led on by the chiefand a hirelying priest, commenced to affect them to endeavour to get them to leave the churchAmong other things they tiedbrother and his wife up fortwo days and nights. Also badlywhipped, knocked down and kickedanother brother and but for beingafraid of the laws of the landsno doubt would have killedthem. The guilty parties weresummoned before Judge Boothbut did not receive their just dues, as he, the Judge, is a 
 fathers, that taught them to live in peace, quit eating each other &c. &c. Surely they feel that priestcraft is in danger. They are trying to stir pup the people against us, but, thank God, all their desires fail, and will continue to do so.The tracts you so friendly sent, arrived safely and have been distributed to the various districts, and we feel thankful that we can dis-tribute the printed word among the Europeans, but our experience among them forces, this con-clusion upon our minds; viz that there are but very few really honest and heart amongst them. Those that have been baptized into the church do not turn out well as a general rule. There is far more pleasure in laboring among the Maories with all their weaknesses and pecul-iarities.During the conference it was thought best to hold two conferences each year, one in the North and one in the South of the island because of the great distance to be traveled. Keeping ma^n^y away from being present, and notwith-standing the great expense of feeding such a gathering, they are all anxious to have it in their own districts.We will take pleasure in sending a copy 
 member of the Church of Englandand a friend to the minister.But on word being sent to Well-ington, the Government seat, con-cerning their proceedings we wereinstructed to take the next caseto the higher court, with apromise that we should receivejustice as they approved of ourlabours among the natives. Forwe are teaching them to keepthe laws of the land etc. We,therefore, do not look for anotheroccurrence of that kind, at leastat the same place.It is with hearts filled withthanksgivings and praises unto ourHeavenly Father, that we reportto you the condition of thisimportant mission. For we realize 
 of the Book of Mormon by the first returning Elders.Having now sufficient Elders we have direct-ed two from this conference, Elders N. S. Bishop andJos S. Groesbeck, to labor on the South Island, to endeav-or to open up the work amoung the Maories of that is-land. A native brother who has lived there has alsobeen appointed to accompany them.All the Elders at the conference unite in send-ing profound love and blessings, and ever prayingfor the richest blessings of Heaven to be yours to enjoy,that you may ever be fully adequate for everycircumstance which may arise, we remainYour Brother in the Gospel of Christ.Wm Paxman 
 that it is through the blessingsof God, and the ernest efforts of myco-labourers, that we are enabledto make such a favorable andgood report. In this the Bay ofIslands District, in which I amnow laboring and will be, theLord willing, for some time yet,there has been one hundred andtwenty five added to the Churchduring the past six weeks, andthe prospects are most encourag-ing for many more to come forth and enter into the Churchof Christ through the door ofbaptism, in the near future.Very favorable reports reach mefrom all the Districts and moreor less are being added to theChurch. In Australia the Elders 
 meet with a great amount ofopposition to encounter. And thereseem to be very few that carean iota about religion. They aremore lovers of pleasures than loversof God, their lives being theriches of the world. Still theElders labors with great diligenceand are doing all that liesin their power to warn thepeople. Sister Armstrong andfamily of five children, emigratedby the last mail steamer fromthat place. This makes it stillworse for the Elders, as that wastheir best and almost onlyhome. We have had five thous-and tracts printed entitled, "Goodtidings or the New and EverlastingGospel" by Jos. F. Smith for 
 that part and the Europeans uponthese Islands. So with the tractsyou are sending us we will bebetter prepared to warn the peopleand find the few honest in heartThe health of the Elders is good,as far as I now know. Andthere is general goods healthprevailing among the Saints.As was expected Elders H. J. Manning and M. S. Marriott wife and childand Sister Katie left for home bythe last mail steamer, as also a young sister, Charlotte Rowntree,and the six mentioned from Sydney. Elder Manning was ap-pointed to take charge of thecompany. They return with Hon-orable Releases having performedfaithful missions 
 Te Hauke, Hawks BayNew Zealand,July 3, 1888President Wilford Woodruffand Quorum of Apostles;Dear and beloved Brethren:Once more through the loving kindness of our Heaven-ly Father we are permitted to address you by letter, inanswer to your most welcome and highly appreciated fa-vor of the 24th of May, which reached us on the 30th ofJune, since which time it has been read and re-read with increased interest and joy, for we need not statethat our hearts were made to swell within us with rejoic-ings, and praises unto the Lord our God to know thatanother Temple had been dedicated unto the Most highGod, and made holy by His presence and acceptance, and by the rich out pouring of His Holy Spirit tofill every part thereof even to the rejoicing of all thatwere permitted to enter its sacred portals, many of whom, I feel assured, heard and saw the marked manifestationsof Gods approval and acceptance of so beautiful anoffering from His covenant children. Your discriptionof its elegance and beauty of finish, making it so grandand pleasing to the eye, was very gratifying indeed.We could not helpp feeling in our hearts, Oh, that wemight have been present to have partaken of thoseblessed privilages, yet, feeling at the same time, that 
 As we may not be able to writeto you for some time, and inorder to give you time, willhere state, that we would liketo have four or five Elders forthis Mission arrive in Aucklandin March next. The steamerwill leave San Francisco aboutthe 8th of March.Elders J. E. Magleby and J. W. Kau-leinamoku, have now been hereabout three years and four monthsTherefore it will be right forthem to return home in earlySpring. They have filled most ex-cellent missions. So please sendthe means for their return fareson the Union Bank of Australiaat Auckland.We were much gratified to 
 we are just where Father wants us to be; therefore we arereconciled to labor with our might to bless this branchof the house of Israel. And we unite with you in theprayer that the Mighty One will ever preserve it fromthe hands of the wicked and the defilement of the unclean, that it may continue a house holy unto the Lord, in which the Saints may receive their blessings, & labor forthe redemption of their dead.Surely this will be an aditional strength to the Saints, in which we will have greater power with the heavens;God grant that it may be so.How rejoiced we were to learn of your brief stayin Juab Stake, and that we had a son that was worthyof your confidence and had the privilage of an inter-view with you; we had expressed a wish that you mighthave the privilage of dedicating the Temple beforeit was open to the public.The account given of the actions of the Receiver isnot so pleasing; they produce feelings of another kindfor we see in his actions the strong determination ofSatan to destroy the church of Christ, and afflict inevery possible way the saints of the Most High, andfeel if he can stop the glorious labor that is now beingdone in the Holy Temples, he will have gained a great victory.  Earnest prayers are being offered up in this thenethermost part of the earth, for the Lord to preserve thoseholy buildings from falling into the hands of our enemiesyet, at the same time we fully realize that all is in 
 the hands of the Lord, and that he will control all thingsfor the best, for, as you sayo beautifully say, come what will, it will not destroy the fact of revelation or theGospel being restored, and if we are faithful to them nopower can seperate us from the love of our Lord andMaster Jesus Christ.By the same mail that brought your letter we learnwith deep regret of the death of our beloved brother ApostleErastes Snow. Another noble spirit has gone to join withour illustrious prophets, apostles, patriarchs, and saintsthat have gone before, to intercede with the heavenly hostsin the behalf of the saints left behind.The seven Elders mentioned by you, arrived at Aucklandin safety on the 23 of June, feeling well in spirits, and havebeen assigned to their fields of labor as follows: Jas. S. Nye, Hawks Bay; R. Gibbons, Poverty Bay; Walter S. Reid, Bay of Islands; Jos. S. Dame, Waikoto; Jos. N. Haywood, Mahia; John S. Bingham, Waiapi;and Thos. C. Young, Hauraka districts, the last three toteach school, and in a short time Elder Reid willalso teach school in the Bay of Islands.In relation to our day-schools, we will here state that weare careful not to organize them, only in such parts wherethere are no Government schools within reach of the child-dren, and where there are a number of children growing up inignorance, for we see it will be a labor to keep them up;however, it affords the Elders this teaching, an opportunityof acquiring the language, and fitting them for the 
 learn of the success of thework of the Lord upon theSamoan Islands and trust thatthe interest may continue.Also very thankful to know thatthe new judges are acting withmore justice and consideration to-wards the Saints. And do sin-cerely trust that the samespirit may continue to be mani-fested. We learn from the papersthat the Supreme Court of theTerritory has decided against usin the property suit. That is asgood as we could naturally expectfrom that body. But we sincerelyhope that that ^the^ Supreme Court of the U States may have eyes to see andears to hear, that justice may bedone. We are well in health 
 and feeling splendid in our laborsand desire to do all that liesin our power to further the pur-poses of God on this part ofGod's vineyard. The printing of theBook of Mormon is progressing nicely.We desire to have it completed byour April Conference. Though themeans is coming in rather slowlyat present.Ever praying for the choicestblessings of God our Eternal Fatherto be yours. That you may beadaquate to every emergencyWith profound and sincere love inWhich Elders Geo Romney Jr. andE. Mangleby, who I am now with,join. I am now as everYour Brother in the Gospel of Christ.Wm Paxman 
 Elders for this mission, if it could be arranged forthem to leave San Francisco by the steamer that sailsfrom there on the 17 of October. I could meet them on their arrival at Auckland, as, the Lord willing, I will be there at that time on my way to the Bay ofIslands, the extreme north end of the Island: iftwo or three of that number had an aptitude to teachschool we would be thankful.We are now extending our labors more among the Eu-ropeans, than we have done before, and by the blessingsof the Lord there has been quite a few baptized, but welabor unde[r] a disadvantage in not having a suply of tractsfor them, and, having the publishing of Book of Mormon onhand, we dare not ask for means out side of that. TheTithing that comes in is but very small, hardly suffic-ient to meet the small current expenses. If some ofour brethren that have made fortunes in a day, by sellingtheir inheritences, could be induced to send out a few thous-and tracts, treating on the first principles of the Gospeletc., we could make excellant use of them, and they wouldthereby be preaching the Gospel by the printed word; thetracts could be sent by the coming Elders without anyexpense.Since our last letter to you, gratifying words havereached us from the Mahia, Hauraka and Bay of Island districts of the aditions to the Church by baptism, therehave also been aditions in this the Hawks Bay district ofboth Europeans & natives, and the prospects for the fu- 
 c/o James Hay,Cobden StreetNewton, Auckland,New Zealand.May 8th 1889President Wilford Woodruff.Dear and much beloved Brother.We are just in receipt of your most esteemed favorof the 1st of April, which was read and reread withdeep interes,.  And we feel greatly blest to receiveso much of your attention and kind consideration, andwas indeed blest in our feelings to learn of the goodhealth of yourself and those of the Apostles. As also tolearn of the prosperety and welfare of Zion in allof her department. It was most gratifying tolearn of the grand success of the Church Schools noworganized, as also of the bright prospects of othersbeing started in the near future.We feel assured that you had a glorious time duringyour conference, and we sincerely hope thatamong the "important items of buisness transadid"that the First Presidency was organized, as wefeel that the Church is much stronger with allher quorums fully organized, and how blestwe as saints are, for your life having beenpreserved upon the earth to direct the affairsof God upon His foot stool, having been sofamiliar with the Church of Christ from 
 the beginning, Surely the Lord has had apurpose in thus preserving you with all yourmental and physicial faculties to such a ripeage.  And may God's choice blessings ever bewith you and those associated with you, is themany earnest prayers that are offered up byour dusky friends, as also the Elders.We with you sincerely desire that our en-emies will not prevail with Prest Harrisonin getting our most bitter enemies appoin-ted to fill the various offices of the Territory.We are indeed verry grateful for your kin-dness in loaning the $500, asked for, thatwe might be able to meet our obligationsincured in the printing of the 2,000 copiesof the Book of Mormon in Maori: and feelexceedingly thankful for the same.And we are truly happy to be able to statethat we are in a possition so that we willnot need to use more then $200 of theamount sent, as we stated in our lettersent to you by the last mail. So if youhave not sent the  90 - asked for, on therecept of this, please do not send only 30 and credit us with the $300, and theLord willing it will be but a short timebefore we will be able to refund theremaining $200, as the Natives are 
 future look fully as favorable as at any time in thepast; for, although the ministers of the various churchesare doing all that lay in their power against the work ofGod among our dusky friends, calling their chiefs togetherto poisen their minds etc., they do not succeed as they wouldlike, for they generally find some of our Elders or Saints torebut their statements and stand up in our favor, giving the natives a chance to see the differance between p Priesthoodand Priestcraft, and in many cases doing more good thanharm, for they overstep all bounds of reason, and tellsuch barefaced falshoods that even the natives can de-tect them.On my return from the South, I found Elder S. Sandersand Sister Katie in the enjoyment of health, and about fin-ishing the writing of the MSS, ready for the reading beforeour Maori brethren, as soon as they can get there.Elder Marriott wrote me a few days ago asking ifthere would be any objections of one of our Native Sistersemigrating to Zion, the only objection I see in the wayis, that others will desire to follow in the same way, forit will not do to extend to one any liberties that cannot begiven to all as they are so peculiar in this respect, so muchlike children we have to be exceedingly careful in everymovement we make with them, and with their limitedexperience in the Gospel, and their natural desire to im-itate after the evils. Fears are entertained by us thatsome of them might partake of the bad element ofour once peaceful cities and report back the amount 
 anxious to get the books to read, and in afew days we will have another 500 copiesready for sale.  We have indeed beenblest in this labor.Now dear President, regarding  your enquiries."Have you any suitable Elder or Elders now withyou whom you can recommend to succeed youwhen you are released to return home, or do youthink it will be necessary or desirable that someElder specially called to preside in Australasia besent from here?"  We will here state, thatwe have two Elders that in my judgmentwould be suitable to fill this possition, namelyAngus. T. Wright of Ogden, who has been here1 1/2 years.  And J. S. Bingham of Clifton, Ida-ho, who is a counciler to the Bishop of thatWard, he has been here one year the 23rd ofnext month, they are both good men, and wou-ld do all that laid in their power to furtherthe work of God in this land.  I fear how-ever that the first named would not beable to endure so much horse back ridingas is required of the president of this mission,as he is enclined to be stout and riding tomuch on horse back seem to hurt him.At our anual conference, last month,they were both appointed to preside oververry important districts, those that had 
 of wrong doing there is in the midst of the saints, such as drinking, smoking, swearing, Sabbath-breaking etc., which would spread from one end ofthe Island to the other, thereby doing much harm.It might be well to here state that our dusky friendsare exceedingly fond of all sports and ammusements, such as horse races, billiards, foot ball, foot-races, etc., andit would not require but a small exertion on their partto follow after all such things. Our feelings are thatwhen they emigrate, there should be a suitable locationfor them to gather to, that they might be together, as alltheir work now is done on the United order principle;they will not work, live, eat or sleep alone, and they arenot ever fond of work, but if properly directed they cando a great deal of work. Having thus given our feelings inbrief, we will be pleased to receive and carry out anysuggestions or instructions you may deem best to giveon this matter.There is general good health prevailing in the midst ofthe saints, there has been no time since our arrival herethat the saints have been so free from sickness. The health of the E[l]ders and Sisters is also good, for whichwe feel exceedingly thankful to our Heavenly Father.We were rejoiced to learn of your good health andhave a great desire that it may so continue, for wesee to a limited extent the great labors that are uponyou in these very trying times as also the intenseanxiety. Earnest, yet humble prayers are con 
 been somewhat neglected for the wantof suitable Elders to preside over them.  And if eith-er of them were called, we would not knowjust how to fill up the vacency and do justiceto the district, yet, if you are led to appointone of them we could get along some how,but, if a good wise fatherly Elder couldbe sent from home, it might be good, asit would give him a longer time topreside, and leave these districts mentionedin a better condition.This mission is quite large and is stillgrowing.  It now take about a year togo over the same, attending conferences,etc.   We have a great desire, and feelsure that the ^right^ one will be appointed, forthis is a verry peculiar people to handle,and by the blessings of the Lord we now havetheir love and confidance.Elder A. L. Stewart, will return home witha small company of European saints, bythe steamer that bring this to you, he isa good faithful worker and have prefor-med a good mission of two years; thelast one being in Australia.With him I will send copies of theBook of Mormon in Mauri for yourselfand Prests George Q Cannon and Jos. F. Smith.

 two of our clerks have left us; Bro. Grimshaw cannot standMormonism any longer or the hard times, and he has left for England on his own hook, and Bro Bullock has been calledby President Young to go on a Mission to England, so there are none now, but Leo, Robert and myself, but we shall do the best we can. We have got through with the history of Joseph up to his death, unless you give us something more in answer to the letter we sent you by the last mail, to fill up some blanks &c. We shall next commence upon the History of Brigham Young &c.There is nothing very strange with us, all is peace and quietness with us while the strom is raging in the lower world, the only thing we have heard of late to create any excitement at all, and that but little was that Troskalawski one of the U. S. Surveying party had been damning the people and boys, and calling them, in the streets anythinghe could think of. One evening while calling the two Mechams"God damned Mormon sons of Bitches" they pitched him downinto the ditch and gave him a thrashing, and it has been saidthat Gen. Burr was going to leave in consquence of it but ithas not made much stir.Your family are well, as is the case with the families of all the brethren who are there. We are going a head with the Agricultural and Manufacturing interest; the Hands aretaking the matter up, in this city, and becoming Auxiliarybranches of the Society, and are going into the Manufacturing business as far as possible, we have it to do, as the money is nearly all gone out of the Territory. There is a general council and feeling through this Territory to retrench ourexpenses at the Stores and make all that we have to use, as faras we can.

We have eager-ly scanned the newspapers on the arrival of our mails to learn if possible the decision on pend-ing cases. We really have no fear 
 servants and highly favored mouth pieces.I am pleased to report that five Elders reachedhere in safety, enjoying good health, and having had a very pleasant voyage.One of them, Bro. A. L. Young was selected to con-tinue on to Australia, to labor under the direction of Elder Geo E. Woolly who now has charge of that field of labor.

Is he considered the same as a regularly called elder? that is, sub-ject to my directions, awaiting a release from me, and entitled to the usual amount for his fare?I was informed that the mission was his own choice, and got the impres-sion that he would return at his pleasure, and con-sequently, with his own means. When I met Pres.Chipman he made en-quiries respecting him which leaves me in doubt.He also stated that the old gentleman was failing quite fast, and should be released as he would be 
 have been reported to the News we will not enter into them again, but will state that we find the saints generally feeling well, and desirous of living up to the principles of Salvation. Our re-ports will show how the cause is moving. While they are not coming in so fast as formally, yet those who receive the Truth now, have considered longer, under-stand its requirements better, and should be stronger to with-stand the weaknesses of the flesh to which they in particular seem subject.Ever praying Heavens choic-est blessings upon you and all Gods true servants, with much love I remainObediently YoursAngus T.

 better off among friends at home.There will probably be no Elders returning though before October, and I don't think it advisable for the old gentleman to undertake the journey alone. There is a prospect of having another small company of emigrating Saints by that time.In your latest communi-cation, you speak as though there may be some elders following. I will be very glad indeed to get them, or at least two more which will make up the number I asked for, and fill existing vacancies.I find it ne^ce^ssary to keep

Please notify five instead of four,to reach here at the time stated.We have started again on our tour of inspection or visits among the various districts of the mission, and thus far have found the Saints feeling well in the Gospel, and no more than the usual amount of troubles to settle. 
 As the winter rains have begun, and earlier too than usual, traveling is made disagreeable and in some parts impossible on account of the heavy floods which are quite common to the country.We continue to enjoy good health, as do all of the Elders, and nothing more serious than an occasional attack of the Gripps, or slight cold has troubled any of us for some time. Were we not satisfied that the prayers of our dear ones and the Saints generally are heard by our Heavenly Fatherand that we are preserved by Him, it would seem 
 almost miraculous the way in which we are enable to stand the inconveniences of the Mission and the changeableness of this climate.Praying for the success of Zion and the health and prosperity of her inspired leaders, I am your obedient servant,Angus T.
