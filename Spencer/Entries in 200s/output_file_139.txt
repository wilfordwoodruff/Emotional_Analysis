He had laboured travled Joyed Sorrowed  felt and experienced with them during that time He had seen men rise and fall and one thing he wished to speak  off he had seen many of the Sisters in at various times  feel disposed to marry out of the Church and think their is  no harm in it they can marry a Gentile and no harm  in it. But what is the truth in the case it is the same now as anci ently for instance in the days of Noah the daughters of Noah married out of the Church in some instances and were not saved  with him in the ark but they and their seed were cut off from the Earth forever. So with Lot some of his daughters married Gentiles out of the Church while in Sodom and Gomorrow and would not go out with their Father Lot but were destroy- ed they and their posterity from off the Earth so it is with the  Sisters in the Church in this day those who marry out of the Church marry those who are doomed to destruction and their posterity while those who are in the Church and are faithful will live and their children to the last Generation. Brother  Pratt exhorted the Saints to unite in building up the kingdom of God He felt that their was a good spirit generally prevail- ing in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints He was  going on a long mission He wanted the prayers of the saints in his behalf and those who were going with him that they might save the souls of men and open the gospel to those of other tongues and languages I think the time has come when it should be done but I feel that I can do nothing of myself in this matter except the Lord helps me. I feel thankful that I can leave my family  and children here in the midst of the Saints I do not wish  to go to the states to preach the gospel to the nation that has driven us out if they want the Gospel let them come and ask for it as we have travled with blistered feet to carriey it to them and then, then they would curse us for it many other good  remarks were made by Elder Pratt.
