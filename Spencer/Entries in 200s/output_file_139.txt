 Elder W. W Woodruff  Thanked God that he had lived to seea Presbyterian Meeting House filled with the Latter Day Saintsand the Pulpit occupied with the Apostles of the Lamb.  The Mothersof Israel are to bear a royal people.  Instructed the little boys toseek truth and rigtheousnes. They are to bear off this Kingdom 
 Elder W. Woodruff Remarked that weare in a great school, the principals ofwhich are numerous & importantWe should prize our liberty, our priviledges,the gospel of life and salvation, the holypriesthood, the living oracles, thewritten word, and the promise ofeternal life. We should labor to buildup the Kingdom of God,  to overcomethe world, the flesh and the DevilThe more of the spirit of God a personhas the more they are like Him.We are under obligations before theLord to live so as to possess enoughof the Holy spirit to keep his com-mandments and the counsels givento us by His servants 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff Has always re-joiced in the Gospel. Spoke of his earlyconversion to the truth of the Latter day work.Was Baptized immediately after hearing it.Encouraged the saints with a lengthy and vigorous appeal, to live honestly and truthfullywith each other and their God, that they may enjoy life Eternal. 
 Elder W. W Woodruff.  We as as people occupy a po-sition now that we are acknowledged by all mento be a living fact.  We are in Zion, and are learningits praticle workings.  The Prophets of old saw itin its purity and glory, but the mnutia of build-ing it up is to be revealed day by day, as circumstances develop themselves.  We have the promise thatthis Zion will never be thrown down.  We are the onlypeople upon the earth who are preparing for the com-ing of the Son of Man.  There is not a place we havededicated to God, but what is held sacred unto God.And we shall have to rebuild the waste places.  God hasa willing people and although we have labored thirtyeight years, Zion is not built up to attract the gazeand admiration of the nations.  The word of wisdom isnow a commandment with ^for^  us to keep.  Spoke of the greatnumber of evil spirits that are in existence: probablyseventy to each person on the earth.  Without revelationwe could not do any thing as Latter Day Saints.  The futureis glorious, if we are obedient, to the counsels of Godsservants upon the earth. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff. We have covenanted to serveGod, Keep his commandments, and proclaim his gospel to the children of men. Much is crowded intothis generation dispensation, more is required of usthan any other. The Elders of to day have traveled a thousandmiles to where the Elders of Jesus traveled one. Many of the Apostals who laid the foundation of this church, have passed away. Bro H. C Kimball s testimony is now in forcewith us. He was a great Prophet a man of integrity:is now resting in peace. We know but little aboutthe laws in the spirit world, whether the spirits arearound about us or not. We do not prize our bless-ings our Prophets until they are gone. Refered to thesuccess of the Missionaries in the southern States. Thosewho keep the Celestial Law will recive a celestial sal-vation. We do not live up to the Revelations we havenow received. Bro Heber is now visiting with JosephHyrum and the other faithful one who have gone before.Those who apostatize will go down to hell,and be angels to the Devil, and will regret in throughout all Eternity. Let us live our religion. 
 Elder W Woodruff related some of this ex-prience when the spirit of God alone sustained and di-rected him. There never was a time when the saintsneeded more of the spirit of the lord than at thepresent. The work of the saints is to pepare aplace where Jesus can come and preside. Afterlaboring for thirty years will we sell our birth rightfor a few goods? The Lord has kept His covenantwith us and has come out of His hiding place.The nations are vexed by his fury. Many of the Elders and High Priests of thirty years standing willsustain the wicked in our midst. The spiritsays let them alone from this hour. 
 Elder W Woodruff. The two spirits had a war-fare with the Prophet Joseph. The Devil tempted him to obtain the plates for riches. The lives of all the prophets and Apostles should give us joy. Delighted to see the thousands of children during the recent mission to Sanpete. There is a great work before them Desires that the saints will live their religion, and be prepared for the coming of the Son of Man. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff. This is the greatestday and generation that has ever been. Preach-ing the gGospel, rebuilding of Jerusalem andthe coming of the Son of God. It required a vast amount of faith in God, for the Elders to go forthwithout purse or script, and establish the Gospel.But the Latter Day Saints are a peculiar people.We do live in a fast age, Gods and Men and Devils. Every thing in Heaven, on Earth and in Hellare in a hurry. Brigham Young is the Lordsmouth piece to this people. He is labouring to build up Zion, agreeable to the decrees of theAlmighty. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff, unless we have the spiritof God our Religion is a farce, in all ages of the world the devilhas harted the saints. It is a shame indeed that men in as greatpossitions as Vice President and Legislators of this land shouldseek to destroy the saints. We are all in the hands of God andare perscecuted for our relegion, this is a wicked and lyinggeneration, the most of all other that have been on the faceof the earth. 50 years ago a murder was almost unknownMay we perform the work before us in a manner, acceptableto God and all the Holy men that have gone before. 
 Elder W. Woodruff. There are but two churches upon the earth, the church of God, and the church of the Devil.  we have everything on our side to make us rejoice, God the Hosts of heaven and the good and great Saints who have passed before.  The dead are visiting the living to stir them up to perform the necessary duties for the dead. This nation are getting ripe for the wrath of God for he prom-ised the wrath of God  the brother of Jared that none shouldmaintain it unless they served him, they have had a little rebellion  warni[n]g in the recent rebellion and are to day divi-ded and the most corrupt of all people that ever lived upon the earth. Cooperation should have been adopted 20 years ago, to keep the devil from us. 
 Page 1 from page 34 [of "An explanation of the Masonic Plate; showing the emblems of each degree from the entered apprentice to the Royal Arch or Five Orders of Masonry" by John Harris published in Bristol, England in 1839.]Shall here add a little further on MasonryKing Solomon's officers appointed before he commandedthe work of the Temple. [##1 Kings 4:7-19##]King Solomon appointed Deputy Grand Masterthe Illustrious Tito prince Harodin, Senior Grandwarden; And the Noble prince Adoniram, Juniorgrand warden [##1 Kings 4:1-6##]; the number of them employed, aranged, and classed in every Department of this work was asfollows, The first, Harodin princes, Rulers or Provoststhree Hundred; Secondly, Mon Atzchism or overseers,as the fifteen and comforters of the people in workingthese were expert workmen & named by King Solomonmasters meaning mMasters over the workman tothe number of 3,300; thirdly Ghiblim, named StoneSquarers, polishers and Sculptors, Hewers, Setters,Layers & Builders, [##1 King 5##] those these were expert Fellowcrafts80,000 the number of ^Free^ Masons employed in the work ofthe temple, exclusive of the Two Grand Masters Wardens;113,600, the men of burdens 70,000 not numbered asMasons; in the quarries were 750 lod[g]es, each containingone master, two wardens, & eleven times seven brethren,which amount to 6,000 men; in the forest of Lebanon were420 lodges, with the same number in each which 
 make 33,600; the levy out of Israel had always20,000, at rest, and these sums make together 113,600,The exact number employed at the work of thetemple, exclusive of the Ishsabbal, who were litterallyslaves to the workmen. It was 480 years afterthe delivery of the children of Israel from their Egptianbondage [##Exodus 15##], that Solomon laid the foundations stoneat the north east angle of the Temple on Mount Moriah [##2 Chronicles 3:1##]one of the three hills of Jerusalem; they were employedthree years in preparing the materials for thebuilding for the Earth was raised 400 cubits, beingsix hundred feet, in order to form it on a levelwith the surface of the rock on which the building wasraised. Every [thing] being prepared, King Solomon, on the Fourth year of his Reign and on the Second Day of theMonth, laid the Foundation Stone, according tothe plan given by David his father upon the arkof alliance; every energy was used to render it a perfectspecimen of art; every stone, every piece of timber wascarved marked & numbered in the Quarry & ^in the^ forest& nothing remained for the workmen at Jerusalembut to join the materials with precission, on a refferenceto the marks & numbers given by the workmen 
 and this was effected without the use of ax, hammers,or mettal tool, so that nothing was heard at Zions saveharmony & peace; theres appears to have been a curiousidea of pollution in the use of any iron tools leveledabout the Tabernacle, or holy structure (by the Masons)as it seemed this command was given to Mosesby the Almighty on Mount Sinai [##Exodus 20##], respectingthe construction of the Tabernacle, that no toolsof Iron to be used, giving in the stronged terms asconveying pollutions, but gold, silvers & wood; brasswork at a distance, for the sound was not to be heard atthe Tabernacle. The Temple of Solomon was ownlya small building, & very inferior in point of sizeto some of our Churches, its dimensions beingownly 150 feet long and 135 feet broad, but its splendor& superiority lay in the richness of its materials, itwas built of white marble so excellently put togetherthat even the joints could not be distinguished, & lookedas one entire stone, the timber was of ceder & olive woodcovered with plates of gold & even studded with preciousjewels; the expense of the building & ornaments of thisTemple, it is said by Villopandus, amounted to  904,322,500, sterling 
 The value of the gold vessels alone was  545,296,206, sterlingand the silver was  439,344,000; added to this the wages,provission, and other necessaries for 100,000 workmenand 70,000 slaves for upwards of seven years! Besides300 grand officers on masters and 3,300 overseers in whomin addition to their wages, King Solomon presented as afree gift  6,763,977, Henoditus informs us the yearlytreasures imported from Ophir was  3,240,000 sterlingall of our money; his annual tribute from dependantnations, was  4,796,200 sterling. Solomon hadships & sailed them to Ophir and Tarshish for gold, Silver& precious stones, which was the most valuable partof his revenue; he visited those places in person & withhis usual wisdom superintended not ownly thecollages of naval architecture established there but also the tithing out of his own ships for the improvementof this important branch of traffic, which [mattered this]to beautify the Temple with such splendour, to theservice of God A talent of Gold is  5,476 sterling5/27375

This rod alsorefered to the mighty work about to be accomplished inEgypt; for as the rod of Mosess government was fearfulas the attack of a serpent to the Egyptians, so it was ascepter of righteousness to the children of Israel. It wascalled the rod of God, & used by Aaron in Egypt & Mosesin the wilderness. It was a sign of the Divine Author-ity, & a visible demonstration of Gods power;used to confound the pretended skill of the Magicianstheis show the Omnipitence of the Deity, & to humble thepride of Pharaoh when he beheld the mighty wonders wroughtby so apparently contemptible [on agent] as a Shephard's Staff,

Beforethe consecration of the Temple it was visited by HiramKing of Tyre who was a complete master of the science ##1 King 7:13## 
 of operative masonry, & after fully viewing all its parts, he pronouncedit to be the highest effort of human genius, in which herenounced his claim to pre-eminence on this noble scienceof Grand Master of all masons. [##1 Kings 7:13-37##] The fame of his grand edificesoon prompted the inquisitive of all Nations to travel &spend some time at Jerusalem, & survey its exccellencies,as far as was allowed to the gentiles, & they soon found thatthe joint skills of all the world came infinitely short ofthe Israelites in the wisdom, strength & beauty of their architecture. when the wise King Solomon was Grand Mastersof all Masons at Jerusalem, when the learned King Hiramwas Grand Master at Tyre & the inspired had beenmaster of the work; when true masonry was under thecare & direction of heaven & when the noble & wisethought it an known to be associates of the ingeniouscraftsman in them well fenced lodges; according to theTemple of became the just wonder of alltravelers on Earth. The pillars differ even in scripturein regard to the size; they were nobly adorned with [chapiters]&c, &c, and surmounted by two spherical Balls whichrepresented the two globes of the Earth & Heavens & pointedout Masonry universal. [##1 Kings 7:40-41##] They were thus placedby the expert by the direction of King Solomon in refferenceto the remarkable pillar of a cloud & of fire whichproved a light & guide to the Israelites in their miraculous 
 escape from Egyptian Bondage, & covered with darknessto the Egyptians, proved their destruction in the red sea.King Solomon fearing the obduracy of his subjects mightof some future time cause them to forget the circumstances attending that remarkable deliverance; placed the pillars thussurmounted to this elevation situation, as a publicmonument to remind the Jews when they entered or leftthe Temple of the mercy of God to their nations; [##1 Kings 7:40-51##] in that greatevent, these two pillars were of such vital importance to thesupporter of the Temple, that its destructions by Nebuchadnezzer,the Lord, standing upon the alter, commanded the destroy-ing Angel to strike the chapiters, or teach of the pillarthat ruin might ensue, not even of the pillar & porchor the Temple itself on even all Jerusalem, but also ofthe whole Jewish nations or polity; hence as the creationof these pillars is seconded in scripture, as an eminentproof of the magnitude & splendtion splendour of allsolomons empire, as well as the wisdom strength & learnthof the three united Grand, Masters, so was their destructiontypical of the ruin of the Jewish state which recieved atemporary annihilation of seventy years, when this Temple was destroyed, as predicted by Jeremiah & other prophets,for their sins in neglecting to keep holy the sabbatical yearsaccording to the commandments of the Lord.

 Sacramento Mar 13th 1853Bro WoodruffAfter a long silence I wish to write you a few lines as I am sure you are always anxious to know what is going on in the world to describe matters in california I shall not attempt to do in full but shall ask why is it I am a witness always among the ungodly not however by way of complaining for that is not my feeling but on the contrary I Rejoice that I am permited to sail amidstall kinds of Strange scenes and why it throws back the curtain that hangs over Babilon and enables me to know the ways of Men and the dealings of God among the people and I feel like a Watchman on the Picket Post and if I should give way to my feelings Ishould almost shout good and gloriously but there is one thing left to keep me humble and that is hard work but prehaps I shall soon work out the debt and have a chance to rest but if not I must try to bear my fate in patience and not complain truly the scenes I am called to witness are 
 unaccountable Yet nesessary I am now endeavouring to locate my family as none of her numerous friends here have as yet done but as far as the scum of this wise and Gene Gor Generation is concerned they are willing Provided however, my family will deny any frendship for me & it will be as the Devil saw to ^the^ Saviour the Kingdoms of the world and the glory of them all are Yours but I am well persuaded that all the Riches of this world that I am blest with will come from a more reliable source and by untiring dilligence continualy to me the things arround me are quite inter-esting but would not be did I not some times get a peep through the Mist of Dark-ness so as to comprehend the whys andwherfores this is not my home only as it must be yet I feel well I think I have written to you once since I arrived if not I will say the Elders all arrived safe and Received their outfits through the liberately of bro Horner and others but as for me I do not Recon myself popular among the Calefornia saints and Bro Sparks told me they wanted some smart man sent on like Jedediah Grant and there would be buisness for him all the time 
 But as the night is fast coming on I must close this harried Sheet wishing to Be Rememberd to Bro Benson & Geo A Smith to whom I intend to write as soon as I can with this mail I send you Several papers one is the HeraldYours in the bonds of the new Covenant forever Alexander BadlamP. S My house has been robbed and I expect the circumstance will Result in the Hanging of 4 men as the Robberyis supposed to have led to the Murder of one of the gang AB

 Sacramento July 27 1853Dear Bro WoodruffFeeling as I do that my labour is not lost while I take all pains to write you all the news of the day because of the confidence I have in your punc-tuality and kind attention in the full and generous ^fulfilment^ of all your promices and if in this respect my duties are as faithfuly performed it is all I expect to do. I am happy to tell you I feel that my mission in california has quite as nearly commenced it is well for us that the God of Heaven governes all things to bring about his own pur-poses and uses his own instruments to bring about his own work among men on the earth And I rejoice in it and pray that he may use me as seemeth good in his sight And I shall therfore direct all my energies to the upbuilding of the Kingdom of the Most High I have as yet kept free from the entanglements of Babilon I am confident our grand enemy the Devil who has always en-deavoured to check the movments of the servants of god has not been idle while I have been strugling to lay the foundation of a good work,it is not the gold of California I seek as the danties (so called) but a home with my brethren on earth and a full Salvation with the sanctified of allNations and ages Past Present & to Come 
 and I ask no more In reply to your kind and interesting letter I am glad you are appointed on the temple for I know your diligence and this reminds me of the dream you related about the hurry of labour the making of garments & by the Saints who were preparing for the coming of the Son of Man Yet I must say itseems strange to me that so much toil & care falls to the lot of a few and can only conclude the kingdom will be thiers of course it will belong to those who build it. (all Right) Many will find when it too late our Honoured and Heaven endued Apostles & Prop-hets worn out will be known on earth to only as imortal for thier names must live forever May the blessings of Heav-en ever be with them and it is my prayer that all the Saints May be blessed with a glorious harvest that the templemay go on the prospect to me looks good how vast the difference in the numbers of murders in the City of Salt Lake and Sacramento and at San Francisco when the dignity of man is insulted he resorts to arms and he thinks so much of his honour he is willing to sell his rum soaked body to keep that he has not got for if he had true honour he would preserve his own body and spare the life of another Yet duel fighters are the things (not Men) whom the PEOPLE CHOOSE to govern the affairs of State thus Endorsing all thies wicked acts 
 Yet after all we have reason to be glad for a california it is an exelent plaster and the only one I know off strong enough to draw off the scum from the big Salt Lake Basin a portion of golddust is more powerful than Spanish Flies and for the information of those who are nearly GORNE of california fever I would recomend a BATH in some of the pure streams of Utah a little good advice from the Governour and a good situation on the public works before they pull up STAKES to go to a land of which they know but little of but some may say if Bro Badlam can go to california to get Rich why not me I will say wait till you see him Rich and you will get a portion of it as to his family he did not go to california with the expectation of taking them back to the valley but heHE will come when the same calls that sent him awayI know not that I have a bitter enemy in california but expect to enjoy the reputation I live for Mormonism as it is ^is^ Honourable and evry man who honours his calling as a Saint will be respected when he is known it is ignorance in a great degree that troubles many I stop my pen to speak with one of our Ships Company of 1849who tells me I have the good feelings of that company because of the intrest I had for thier welfare if so I am glad and hope to do good to all men wherever i go that none may have occations to complain I find it best to let all things Roll as in thier time and placesEver holding sacred the principles of the gospel and the name of God as Ever I Remain your friend & Brother Alexr Badlam 
 after addings a few items I shall close for the present as it ^is^ Possible that Sister Cobb dont know where Isaac her Nephew is I will say he started ahead of the Elders in January to Sydey in A^us^stralia I wanted him to Remain with Me But he would not I have not heard fromhim he wished me to Remember him to bro Benson which I do through you.A Man whose name is Peter Spencer whose wife is a sister to Ellen Condor wife of Edward Condor all from England is here and wishes to be remembered to the family & also to the Mother whose name is PearcePlease say to Father John Smith I Remember him and shall write also to Bro Geo A Smith And Bro Benson whom I do not forgetPlease Remember me to all [engaring] frindsFarwell Alexr BadlamLook out for papers[sideways text] A.
