 Elder W. W Woodruff  Thanked God that he had lived to see a Presbyterian Meeting House filled with the Latter Day Saints and the Pulpit occupied with the Apostles of the Lamb.  The Mothers of Israel are to bear a royal people.  Instructed the little boys to seek truth and rigtheousnes. They are to bear off this Kingdom 
 Elder W. Woodruff Remarked that we are in a great school, the principals of which are numerous & important We should prize our liberty, our priviledges, the gospel of life and salvation, the holy priesthood, the living oracles, the written word, and the promise of eternal life. We should labor to build up the Kingdom of God,  to overcome the world, the flesh and the Devil The more of the spirit of God a person has the more they are like Him.  We are under obligations before the Lord to live so as to possess enough of the Holy spirit to keep his com- mandments and the counsels given to us by His servants 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff Has always re- joiced in the Gospel. Spoke of his early conversion to the truth of the Latter day work. Was Baptized immediately after hearing it. Encouraged the saints with a lengthy and vig orous appeal, to live honestly and truthfully with each other and their God, that they may  enjoy life Eternal. 
 Elder W. W Woodruff.  We as as people occupy a po- sition now that we are acknowledged by all men to be a living fact.  We are in Zion, and are learning its praticle workings.  The Prophets of old saw it in its purity and glory, but the mnutia of build- ing it up is to be revealed day by day, as circum stances develop themselves.  We have the promise that this Zion will never be thrown down.  We are the only people upon the earth who are preparing for the com- ing of the Son of Man.  There is not a place we have dedicated to God, but what is held sacred unto God. And we shall have to rebuild the waste places.  God has a willing people and although we have labored thirty eight years, Zion is not built up to attract the gaze and admiration of the nations.  The word of wisdom is now a commandment with ^for^  us to keep.  Spoke of the great number of evil spirits that are in existence: probably seventy to each person on the earth.  Without revelation we could not do any thing as Latter Day Saints.  The future is glorious, if we are obedient, to the counsels of Gods servants upon the earth. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff. We have covenanted to serve God, Keep his commandments, and proclaim his gos pel to the children of men. Much is crowded into this generation dispensation, more is required of us than any other. The Elders of to day have traveled a thousand miles to where the Elders of Jesus traveled one. Many of the  Apostals who laid the foundation of this church, have pass ed away. Bro H. C Kimball s testimony is now in force with us. He was a great Prophet a man of integrity: is now resting in peace. We know but little about the laws in the spirit world, whether the spirits are around about us or not. We do not prize our bless- ings our Prophets until they are gone. Refered to the success of the Missionaries in the southern States. Those who keep the Celestial Law will recive a celestial sal- vation. We do not live up to the Revelations we have now received. Bro Heber is now visiting with Joseph Hyrum and the other faithful one who have gone before. Those who apostatize will go down to hell, and be angels to the Devil, and will regret in throughout all  Eternity. Let us live our religion. 
 Elder W Woodruff related some of this ex- prience when the spirit of God alone sustained and di- rected him. There never was a time when the saints needed more of the spirit of the lord than at the present. The work of the saints is to pepare a place where Jesus can come and preside. After laboring for thirty years will we sell our birth right for a few goods? The Lord has kept His covenant with us and has come out of His hiding place. The nations are vexed by his fury. Many of the  Elders and High Priests of thirty years standing will sustain the wicked in our midst. The spirit says let them alone from this hour. 
 Elder W Woodruff. The two spirits had a war- fare with the Prophet Joseph. The Devil tempted  him to obtain the plates for riches. The lives  of all the prophets and Apostles should give  us joy. Delighted to see the thousands of  children during the recent mission to  Sanpete. There is a great work before them  Desires that the saints will live their  religion, and be prepared for the coming  of the Son of Man. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff. This is the greatest day and generation that has ever been. Preach- ing the gGospel, rebuilding of Jerusalem and the coming of the Son of God. It required a vast  amount of faith in God, for the Elders to go forth without purse or script, and establish the Gospel. But the Latter Day Saints are a peculiar people. We do live in a fast age, Gods and Men and  Devils. Every thing in Heaven, on Earth and in Hell are in a hurry. Brigham Young is the Lords mouth piece to this people. He is labouring to  build up Zion, agreeable to the decrees of the Almighty. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff, unless we have the spirit of God our Religion is a farce, in all ages of the world the devil has harted the saints. It is a shame indeed that men in as great possitions as Vice President and Legislators of this land should seek to destroy the saints. We are all in the hands of God and are perscecuted for our relegion, this is a wicked and lying generation, the most of all other that have been on the face of the earth. 50 years ago a murder was almost unknown May we perform the work before us in a manner, acceptable to God and all the Holy men that have gone before. 
 Elder W. Woodruff. There are but two churches upon the  earth, the church of God, and the church of the Devil.  we  have everything on our side to make us rejoice, God the  Hosts of heaven and the good and great Saints who have  passed before.  The dead are visiting the living to stir  them up to perform the necessary duties for the dead. This  nation are getting ripe for the wrath of God for he prom- ised the wrath of God  the brother of Jared that none should maintain it unless they served him, they have had a little  rebellion  warni[n]g in the recent rebellion and are to day divi- ded and the most corrupt of all people that ever  lived upon the earth. Cooperation should have been  adopted 20 years ago, to keep the devil from us. 
 Page 1 from page 34 [of "An explanation of the Masonic Plate; showing the emblems of each degree from the entered apprentice to the Royal Arch or Five Orders of Masonry" by John Harris published in Bristol, England in 1839.] Shall here add a little further on Masonry  King Solomon's officers appointed before he commanded the work of the Temple. [##1 Kings 4:7-19##]  King Solomon appointed Deputy Grand Master the Illustrious Tito prince Harodin, Senior Grand warden; And the Noble prince Adoniram, Junior grand warden [##1 Kings 4:1-6##]; the number of them employed, aranged,  and classed in every Department of this work was as follows, The first, Harodin princes, Rulers or Provosts three Hundred; Secondly, Mon Atzchism or overseers, as the fifteen and comforters of the people in working these were expert workmen & named by King Solomon masters meaning mMasters over the workman to the number of 3,300; thirdly Ghiblim, named Stone Squarers, polishers and Sculptors, Hewers, Setters, Layers & Builders, [##1 King 5##] those these were expert Fellowcrafts 80,000 the number of ^Free^ Masons employed in the work of the temple, exclusive of the Two Grand Masters Wardens; 113,600, the men of burdens 70,000 not numbered as Masons; in the quarries were 750 lod[g]es, each containing one master, two wardens, & eleven times seven brethren, which amount to 6,000 men; in the forest of Lebanon were 420 lodges, with the same number in each which 
 make 33,600; the levy out of Israel had always 20,000, at rest, and these sums make together 113,600, The exact number employed at the work of the temple, exclusive of the Ishsabbal, who were litterally slaves to the workmen. It was 480 years after the delivery of the children of Israel from their Egptian bondage [##Exodus 15##], that Solomon laid the foundations stone at the north east angle of the Temple on Mount Moriah [##2 Chronicles 3:1##] one of the three hills of Jerusalem; they were employed three years in preparing the materials for the building for the Earth was raised 400 cubits, being six hundred feet, in order to form it on a level with the surface of the rock on which the building was raised. Every [thing] being prepared, King Solomon, on the  Fourth year of his Reign and on the Second Day of the Month, laid the Foundation Stone, according to the plan given by David his father upon the ark of alliance; every energy was used to render it a perfect specimen of art; every stone, every piece of timber was carved marked & numbered in the Quarry & ^in the^ forest & nothing remained for the workmen at Jerusalem but to join the materials with precission, on a refference to the marks & numbers given by the workmen 
 and this was effected without the use of ax, hammers, or mettal tool, so that nothing was heard at Zions save harmony & peace; theres appears to have been a curious idea of pollution in the use of any iron tools leveled about the Tabernacle, or holy structure (by the Masons) as it seemed this command was given to Moses by the Almighty on Mount Sinai [##Exodus 20##], respecting the construction of the Tabernacle, that no tools of Iron to be used, giving in the stronged terms as conveying pollutions, but gold, silvers & wood; brass work at a distance, for the sound was not to be heard at the Tabernacle. The Temple of Solomon was ownly a small building, & very inferior in point of size to some of our Churches, its dimensions being ownly 150 feet long and 135 feet broad, but its splendor & superiority lay in the richness of its materials, it was built of white marble so excellently put together that even the joints could not be distinguished, & looked as one entire stone, the timber was of ceder & olive wood covered with plates of gold & even studded with precious jewels; the expense of the building & ornaments of this Temple, it is said by Villopandus, amounted to  904,322,500, sterling 
 The value of the gold vessels alone was  545,296,206, sterling and the silver was  439,344,000; added to this the wages, provission, and other necessaries for 100,000 workmen and 70,000 slaves for upwards of seven years! Besides 300 grand officers on masters and 3,300 overseers in whom in addition to their wages, King Solomon presented as a free gift  6,763,977, Henoditus informs us the yearly treasures imported from Ophir was  3,240,000 sterling all of our money; his annual tribute from dependant nations, was  4,796,200 sterling. Solomon had ships & sailed them to Ophir and Tarshish for gold, Silver & precious stones, which was the most valuable part of his revenue; he visited those places in person & with his usual wisdom superintended not ownly the collages of naval architecture established there but also  the tithing out of his own ships for the improvement of this important branch of traffic, which [mattered this] to beautify the Temple with such splendour, to the service of God A talent of Gold is  5,476 sterling 5/27375

Noah sent out a raven that never returned afterwards, then he sent out the dove that he might ascertain whether the waters had subsided this Bird very soon returned to the Ark, unable from the prevalence of the waters to find a place of rest, at the end of seven days he sent forth a dove a second time, which returned to the Ark with an olive leaf in her mouth, as a token of peace & reconciliation with God, ##Genesis 8## & the olive branch has been adopted

 built by the three Grand Masters before the flood; where was discovered many things, represented on this Masonic plate, with the three Grand Master's names, which can be found in scripture; ##Exodus 32## (by those who know it) it was discovered in the year of the world 2939, and 480, years after the children of Israel came out of Egypt, &c A further illusion to the rod  the transformation of Moses's rod into a serpent had reference to events of the [opeabrt] importance to man, as our first parents were beguiled by the devil, in the form of a serpent so that miraculous rod, which had its origins in the Garden of Eden & is supposed by the Jewish Rabbis, to have been one of the ten things created. on the evening of the first Sabbath & was changed into a serpent as a sign, to confirm the promise of Delivering a select [portion] of their restraints from Egyptian Bondage. This rod also refered to the mighty work about to be accomplished in Egypt; for as the rod of Mosess government was fearful as the attack of a serpent to the Egyptians, so it was a scepter of righteousness to the children of Israel. It was called the rod of God, & used by Aaron in Egypt & Moses in the wilderness. It was a sign of the Divine Author- ity, & a visible demonstration of Gods power; used to confound the pretended skill of the Magicians theis show the Omnipitence of the Deity, & to humble the pride of Pharaoh when he beheld the mighty wonders wrought by so apparently contemptible [on agent] as a Shephard's Staff, 
 but above all, this rod metamorphized, was a type of Christ's death, to which indeed all Masonry, ultimately points; as by a serpent, Death came into the world so by the death of the Son of God, the serpent or Satan, was fully vanquished & trodden under foot.  5. Moses lifting up the serpent. Thus Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilder- ness, that as many as looked on it, might be healed of the wounds, inflicted by firery serpents, for their disobedient murmurings, ##Numbers 21:5-9## & the death of Christ h upon the cross thus typiphied, was to deliver us from sin & Death, & to give a full satisfaction & attonement for the sins of all mankind; Moses took posselnig of  possession of this rod in the land of Midian, & after Jetho had explained all the [posturetay] [posterity] relatives to its movemention from the time of Adam,  & it was directed by the Almighty to be used as the apparent agent of all his miracles. it was changed into a serpent three different times, first at Horeb ##Exodus 4:2-5## again in the land of Goshan before the congregation of the Elders, & lastly in the Court of Pharaoh. ##Exodus 7:8-13## To give Moses a further assurance of his power & protection, God commanded him to put his hand into his bosom, which by  that simple act, contracted a supernatural leprosy; he repeated the second time, but soon became sound & healthy as the other; ##Exodus 4:6-9## next a small quantity 
 of water was changed into Blood at the word of God; ##Exodus 7:17-25## the the asstonishment of Moses was somewhat alleged, & his faith confirmed, by the assumer that he should perform the same, & operates miracels in the land of Egypt to induce pharaoh to set his captive Brether at liberty; as a concluding confirmation of his mission, Moses required to move in whose [many] he was to demand the do liberation of the Israelites, and the Almighty [consderached] to reveal to him that awful name which made the pillars of the East tremble, this tremendious word is or or a construction of  a tremendious context ensued between Moses as the agent of the true God, & the Magicans as the agents of the Egyptian Gods, Moses arrived with that powerful rod what Adam was permitted to take from the tree of knowledge, & which was the acknowledged testimony of his [Diven cominussion] [Diveine Commission], wrote in the presence of  pharaoh & his court at [Taris]; an extraordinary [minute] as a proof that his appeal to the gGod of Israel was not to be slited slited ^slighted^ with impurity; this rod was [eust] by Aaron upon the ground & it immediately became a serpent, twingi twining itself in folds to the combination of the whole cCourt, Amenophis called for Jannes & Jambres ##2 Timothy 3:## his magicians, role under took to perform the same miracle but the serpent of Moses displayed his superiority, by devouring the serpents of the Magicians &c. 
 said it at least: tells him that he had out of his [property] laid up for purpose, one hundred thousand talents of silver gold & a thousand thousand talents of silver vessels brass & iron without wait, & he tills him that over & above what he had mentioned before he had provided three thousand talents of fine gold, & seven thousand talents of silver to overlay the walls of the house, besides all this his princes & agent men made a free gift of five thousand talents of gold, & ten thousand talents of silver towards the building. Now all these sums added to gether make up 108.00 talents of gold at  5075-15-7 is  548,244,150 1,017,000 talents of silver at  353=11=10 is   359,602,725 Total expens of the Building   *   907=846,875  In this glorious undertaking nothing was [smithed] [which] art & [genious] aided by wealth & industry could supply; the twisted & highly earned work of the Parian marble columns the plantings of embossed gold; blazing strung with diamonds & other precious stones; the gorgeous & magnifficent sculptures, all contributed in rich union to display the wisdom of Solomon in his appropriation of this grand Masonic pile, to the [sread] purpose of Gods worship; the strength of King Hiram, for his abundant supplies of materials & men & the [lennth] of the ingenious , who with a capacity more than Mortal man exercised his shinning abilities to their utmost stretch in Devising & executing such a perfect model of art. Before the consecration of the Temple it was visited by Hiram King of Tyre who was a complete master of the science ##1 King 7:13## 
 of operative masonry, & after fully viewing all its parts, he pronounced it to be the highest effort of human genius, in which he renounced his claim to pre-eminence on this noble science of Grand Master of all masons. [##1 Kings 7:13-37##] The fame of his grand edifice soon prompted the inquisitive of all Nations to travel & spend some time at Jerusalem, & survey its exccellencies, as far as was allowed to the gentiles, & they soon found that the joint skills of all the world came infinitely short of the Israelites in the wisdom, strength & beauty of their  architecture. when the wise King Solomon was Grand Masters of all Masons at Jerusalem, when the learned King Hiram was Grand Master at Tyre & the inspired had been master of the work; when true masonry was under the care & direction of heaven & when the noble & wise thought it an known to be associates of the ingenious craftsman in them well fenced lodges; according to the Temple of became the just wonder of all travelers on Earth. The pillars differ even in scripture in regard to the size; they were nobly adorned with [chapiters] &c, &c, and surmounted by two spherical Balls which represented the two globes of the Earth & Heavens & pointed out Masonry universal. [##1 Kings 7:40-41##] They were thus placed by the expert by the direction of King Solomon in refference to the remarkable pillar of a cloud & of fire which proved a light & guide to the Israelites in their miraculous 
 escape from Egyptian Bondage, & covered with darkness to the Egyptians, proved their destruction in the red sea. King Solomon fearing the obduracy of his subjects might of some future time cause them to forget the circumstances  attending that remarkable deliverance; placed the pillars thus surmounted to this elevation situation, as a public monument to remind the Jews when they entered or left the Temple of the mercy of God to their nations; [##1 Kings 7:40-51##] in that great event, these two pillars were of such vital importance to the supporter of the Temple, that its destructions by Nebuchadnezzer, the Lord, standing upon the alter, commanded the destroy- ing Angel to strike the chapiters, or teach of the pillar that ruin might ensue, not even of the pillar & porch or the Temple itself on even all Jerusalem, but also of the whole Jewish nations or polity; hence as the creation of these pillars is seconded in scripture, as an eminent proof of the magnitude & splendtion splendour of all solomons empire, as well as the wisdom strength & learnth of the three united Grand, Masters, so was their destruction typical of the ruin of the Jewish state which recieved a temporary annihilation of seventy years, when this  Temple was destroyed, as predicted by Jeremiah & other prophets, for their sins in neglecting to keep holy the sabbatical years according to the commandments of the Lord. [##2 Kings 25:8-17##] The priest in the Temple perform every holy office of their religioun with their feet uncovered. It is not any where commanded that the priests should officiate Barefoot but among the garments assigned for the priests shoes not being named 
 Sacramento Mar 13th 1853  Bro Woodruff  After a long silence I  wish to write you a few lines as  I am sure you are always anxious  to know what is going on in the world  to describe matters in california I shall  not attempt to do in full but shall  ask why is it I am a witness always  among the ungodly not however by way  of complaining for that is not my  feeling but on the contrary I Rejoice  that I am permited to sail amidst all kinds of Strange scenes and why  it throws back the curtain that hangs  over Babilon and enables me to know  the ways of Men and the dealings of God  among the people and I feel like a  Watchman on the Picket Post and if  I should give way to my feelings I should almost shout good and gloriously  but there is one thing left to keep me humble  and that is hard work but prehaps I  shall soon work out the debt and have  a chance to rest but if not I must try  to bear my fate in patience and not complain  truly the scenes I am called to witness are 
 unaccountable Yet nesessary I am  now endeavouring to locate my family as  none of her numerous friends here have as yet  done but as far as the scum of this wise  and Gene Gor Generation is concerned they  are willing Provided however, my family will  deny any frendship for me & it will be as the  Devil saw to ^the^ Saviour the Kingdoms of  the world and the glory of them all are  Yours but I am well persuaded that all  the Riches of this world that I am blest  with will come from a more reliable source  and by untiring dilligence continualy to  me the things arround me are quite inter- esting but would not be did I not some  times get a peep through the Mist of Dark- ness so as to comprehend the whys and wherfores this is not my home only as it  must be yet I feel well I think I have  written to you once since I arrived if not  I will say the Elders all arrived safe and  Received their outfits through the liberately  of bro Horner and others but as for me  I do not Recon myself popular among the  Calefornia saints and Bro Sparks told  me they wanted some smart man  sent on like Jedediah Grant and  there would be buisness for him all the  time 
 But as the night is fast  coming on I must close this harried  Sheet wishing to Be Rememberd  to Bro Benson & Geo A Smith  to whom I intend to write as soon  as I can with this mail I send you  Several papers one is the Herald  Yours in the bonds of the new  Covenant forever Alexander Badlam  P.

 Sacramento July 27 1853  Dear Bro Woodruff Feeling as I do that my labour is not  lost while I take all pains to write  you all the news of the day because  of the confidence I have in your punc- tuality and kind attention in the full  and generous ^fulfilment^ of all your promices and  if in this respect my duties are as  faithfuly performed it is all I expect  to do. I am happy to tell you I feel  that my mission in california has  quite as nearly commenced it is well  for us that the God of Heaven governes  all things to bring about his own pur- poses and uses his own instruments  to bring about his own work among  men on the earth And I rejoice in  it and pray that he may use me  as seemeth good in his sight  And I shall therfore direct all my  energies to the upbuilding of the  Kingdom of the Most High I have  as yet kept free from the entanglements  of Babilon I am confident our grand  enemy the Devil who has always en- deavoured to check the movments  of the servants of god has not been  idle while I have been strugling to  lay the foundation of a good work, it is not the gold of California  I seek as the danties (so called) but  a home with my brethren on earth and a  full Salvation with the sanctified of all Nations and ages Past Present & to Come 
 and I ask no more In reply to your kind  and interesting letter I am glad you  are appointed on the temple for I know  your diligence and this reminds me of the  dream you related about the hurry of  labour the making of garments & by the  Saints who were preparing for the coming of  the Son of Man Yet I must say it seems strange to me that so much  toil & care falls to the lot of a few and can  only conclude the kingdom will be thiers  of course it will belong to those who build  it. (all Right) Many will find when it too late  our Honoured and Heaven endued Apostles & Prop- hets worn out will be known on earth to  only as imortal for thier names must  live forever May the blessings of Heav- en ever be with them and it is my prayer  that all the Saints May be blessed with  a glorious harvest that the temple may go on the prospect to me looks good  how vast the difference in the numbers of  murders in the City of Salt Lake  and Sacramento and at San Franci sco when the dignity of man is insulted  he resorts to arms and he thinks so much  of his honour he is willing to sell his  rum soaked body to keep that he has  not got for if he had true honour he  would preserve his own body and spare  the life of another Yet duel fighters are  the things (not Men) whom the PEOPLE CHOOSE  to govern the affairs of State thus Endorsing all  thies wicked acts 
 Yet after all we have reason to be glad for a  california it is an exelent plaster and the  only one I know off strong enough to  draw off the scum from the big  Salt Lake Basin a portion of gold dust is more powerful than Spanish  Flies and for the information of those  who are nearly GORNE of california fever I would  recomend a BATH in some of the pure streams  of Utah a little good advice from the Governour  and a good situation on the public works before  they pull up STAKES to go to a land of which they  know but little of but some may say if Bro Badlam  can go to california to get Rich why not me  I will say wait till you see him Rich and you will  get a portion of it as to his family he did not  go to california with the expectation of taking them  back to the valley but heHE will come when the  same calls that sent him away  I know not that I have a bitter enemy in  california but expect to enjoy the reputation  I live for Mormonism as it is ^is^ Honourable  and evry man who honours his calling as a Saint  will be respected when he is known it is ignorance  in a great degree that troubles many I stop my  pen to speak with one of our Ships Company of 1849 who tells me I have the good feelings of that  company because of the intrest I had for thier  welfare if so I am glad and hope to do good  to all men wherever i go that none may have  occations to complain I find it best to let  all things Roll as in thier time and places Ever holding sacred the principles  of the gospel and the name of God as Ever I Remain your friend & Brother Alexr Badlam 
 after addings a few items I shall close for the present  as it ^is^ Possible that Sister Cobb dont know where  Isaac her Nephew is I will say he started ahead of the  Elders in January to Sydey in A^us^stralia I wanted him to  Remain with Me But he would not I have not heard from him he wished me to Remember him to bro Benson which I  do through you.  A Man whose name is Peter Spencer whose wife  is a sister to Ellen Condor wife of Edward Condor  all from England is here and wishes to be remembered  to the family & also to the Mother whose name is Pearce  Please say to Father John Smith I Remember him  and shall write also to Bro Geo A Smith  And Bro Benson whom I do not forget  Please Remember me to all  [engaring] frinds  Farwell Alexr Badlam  Look out for papers  [sideways text] A.
