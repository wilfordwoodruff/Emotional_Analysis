 Historian's Office, Great Salt Lake City, Jun 30th, 1856.Bro. Bernhisel,Dear sir,We are writing to Elders Geoe A. Smith and John Taylor uponthe subject of the Church History.  We now ask a favor at your hand, viz.that you will meet in joint council with brothers Taylor and Smith, andassist them in making out a precise account of what took place in jailand in going to Carthage &c. We feel that it is due Joseph Smith and theChurch and Kingdom of God, and to all future generations that we embodyevery act and word in the History of the last days of the Prophet, and wehave no way to obtain them only by application to Elder John Taylor,and yourself, in connection with one or two other individuals who were withJoseph and Hyrum during their last days. We feel great difficulty in makingout the history of Joseph during the last three or four days of his life; manystatements are entirely opposed to each other; for instance, Sister Taylorsays that Sister Hyrum Smith and herself got a man who was living atWm Marks's to draw up a petition to the Governor to restore those men inprison to their wives and children; this was signed by Sister Hyrum Smith,Sister Taylor &c &c, but when presented to Emma she utterly refused tosign it. On the other hand Wm Clayton says he was sent for by Emmawhen he was listening to Govr Ford's speech, and wrote out the petitionhimself at her request, and that she was the first to sign it.  Thepetition was presented to the Governor as soon as he had done speaking;he read it, looked down to the floor in silence, and did not look at anyone of the petitioners, but finally said, "I will do what I can," and walkedoff.  Do you know anything of this matter?This period of Joseph's History is the most difficult to make out as Dr. Richardswrote but little, and that in detached sentences, expecting to make it out 
 Our company were Americans, English, Irish,Welsh, Scotch, & Scandinavians.As we passed thro. Iowa many of ourcompany left us to live with the Gentiles.Our handcarts were of a very poor kindsome of the axels almost wore thro' beforewe arrived at Florence.We arrived on the Banks of MissouriRiver August 11th & crossed the riversame day on the steamboat^ferry^boat Nebraska.Several of our company considering thejourney too tedious left our company atFlorence. When we started for the plainsour company was reduced to about 425souls, another wagon was given to our com-pany to haul provisions as we were short ofteam, also about 4 yoke of cattle.We left the little Pappea on the 18th of Augustin good spirits, for G. S. Lake. We travelledalong very well till the 3rd of September, whenmore than one half of our cattle stampededWe were then under the necessity of yokingup some wild Arkansas cows & travellingthe best we could. We made pretty goodheadway till we arrived at the upper crossingof the Platte. Many of our men nowbegan to get weak, some had died, thismade the duties of the camp to fall ona few & began to weaken the rugged & thestrong. 
 G. S. L. City Feb. 28 1857Elders Lyman & RichDear Brethren,The weather for the past few days has been mildand warm, snow disappearing rapidly.The prospects for the agriculturist this season are good. Mountains heavilycovered with snow, the soil deeply moistened with the snow which has lainall winter but has now dissolved; and the Big cottonwood canal in manypalaces [places] nearly finished, which will bring the along the farming lands andinto the city.The Board of the Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Societyhave again commenced their meetings and in this weeks paper have published alist of premiums; the awards are much higher this year which it is presumedwill have a good effect on the Manufacturing interests of our Territory. TheBishops are getting their wards together which are generally organized intobranch societies, and in some instances calling upon the people to contributetheir rings, Jewels, watches &c. to send to the States to buy sheep.Feb. 22 A list of Missionaries for Europe and the Islands was calledoff, to which it is anticipated more will be added, there was also reada list of names called to accompany Prests. Young & Kimball on their northerntrip to Salmon river to start after the April conference.Br. Lyman, the history of the church is now revised and correctedup to Augt. 8 1844 when Prest. Young and the Twelve become the Presidencyof the church, at this period the history will commence, and give a briefaccount of the parentage, early life, missions and history of each of the Twelve.We would be pleased to have your history at your earliest convenience, say from8 to 10 pages foolscap.

 Historian's Office G. S. L. CityFebruary 4th 1857.Elders Lyman & Rich,Dear Brethren,I have understoodthat you were both expecting to come to this city this spring.I write to say that we would like to have you bring withyou Indigo seed sufficient to sow one or two acres, if youcould attend to it; also some madder seed, as we wishto introduce it into the Territory.  I would also like if youcould obtain some Cotton seed for us, we would like toobtain sufficient to sow five acres; and if the Chinesepotatoes, as advertised in Wm R. Prince & Co's catalogue, ofFlushing, New York, has got into your country, try tobring a few of them, if it is not more than one or two.I wish you would try to bring us a few of Hovey's SeedlingStrawberries, as they are counted about the best for producingI received a few Black Prince Strawberries sent me byâ€”Bro Wm E. Dodge, but they are reported by Mr Prince, asbeing unproductive.  Any good cuttings of apples or anykind of fruit that you can bring with you will be acceptable,and any expence that you are at in procuring any kind of seeds or cuttings we will make good. I received a smallbottle of cuttings, the fore part of winter from Brother Rich whichI shall take great pains to preserve.  Please bear these thingsin mind.  I think if a Dozen or two of Hovey's SeedlingStrawberries were put into a little box or can, with a little 
 chalk, alum, and I think he believesthere is salt peter on the islands.As to what bro. Brown mentionsas having been received from SpringvilleI know nothing only what is thereinstated. If you can manufacture Gunpowderand send Prest. Young a specimen itwould be valued highly.Your account of the cotton districtis very encouraging; many have beensanguine that cotton could be raised onthe virgin and that there were somefertile spots on the clara and thevirgin which would raise southernproductions.Should the Iron roll out halfas fast as your letters talks of and thecotton country produces according toyour anticipations this inland Territoryis insured of ^enviable^ commercial independence.Your description of the effects of theReformation pleases me; and I canendorse its truth in my experiencein this portion of the Territory.We have considerable sugar canegrowing here and anticipate it willmeture in this climate.Many are cultivating the castoroil bean and the Hon. J. M. Bernhiselhas sent us some Binney the seedof which produces the bush or stalkfrom which is manufactured thepure sweet oil.There is going to be anexcellent crop of fruit here this season.If you could manufacture aspecimen of Gunpowder for this seasonsexhibition, it would much pleaseBishop Hunter and the Directors ofthe Deseret Agricultural & ManufacturingSociety.yours trulyW.

 Some of the causes that our people got weak wasthey had not enough to eat. From Iowa Cityto Florence, we had 10 ozs of Flour per day& little or no groceries. When we left MissouriRiver we had not quite enough provisionsfor sixty days at 1 lb pr head each pr day.We issued 1 lb of flour to each adult & 8 ozs.to each child per day. About 8 miles westof Laramie we issued flour as follows 14 ozs.to each man; 12 ozs to each woman; 8 ozs toeach child; & 4 ozs to each infant per day.At Independence ^Rock^ we reduced the rationsagain Men 10 1/2 ozs flour; women 9 ozs;children 6 ozs; & infants 3 ozs per day.We issued the last of our flour out atthe 5th crossing of the Sweetwater.

I wish toinform you & Brother Pratt & friends that we have Lost our worthy friend& Brother president J M Grant who died Dec 1st & was foundon the forth 4th under Military honors followed by the greatest processionever found at a funeral in this vally.  He was sick 10 days, later with the chillsfever, turned to the Billious then the Lung fever. Nothing seem to relieve him fromthe time He was first taken. He had a great vision two days before His deathmay things were shown him in the spirit world. He has preached in the Reformationin this City & Territory as though he knew He had but few days tolive. He has lifted up his voice like the trump of an Angel & cryed long & Loudto the people to Repent & live their Religion. I preume he was welcomedthe other side of the Vail. See the 40 No for the News for particulars.The last Hand cart train cane in last Sunday 1st Dec. the weather wasvary cold thermometer standing 10 degres below zero some days on the road. some freezetheir hands & feet their has been some 300 or 400 teams sent out first &last this season to help in the Emigration & some more than 100 tons of floursent out of this city to the Relief of the Emigration the a part of them went nearlyto platt to push up the Hand cart companies.

 Historian's officeG. S. L. city June 13 1857Mr. Eliezer EdwardsDear bro.Yours of May 21st. hasbeen received, and I have had much pleasureand gratification in its perusal.I passed it over to Prest. Youngfrom whose clerk T. D. Brown, I receivedthe accompanying slip for you.Last evening I had your letter readto the Board of Directors of the D. A.and M. Society; all who have heardyour letter read rejoice in the spirit ofit, and are glad there are some in Utahwhose efforts and genius are bent onmaking Gunpowder. It is no doubt wellknown to you that Gunpowder is oneof the most desirable articles that couldbe manufactured in this community, andone which demands our strictest attention,and deepest researches.As to the reports of the discovery ofSalt peter in abundance on Salt Lake islands,it has arisen probably from Captn. Dan Jones' discoveries. He has discovered, slate 
 himself, but died before doing it. Now any assistance you can renderto Geor A. Smith in sending us an account of those things that we may makea correct history will be thankfully received and highly prized. The soonerthis can be attended to the better, as we shall have to wait this information beforewe can continue the History.As to the news of the day we have not much of interest. The drouth hasbeen great and but little water. Nearly all the laboring men of this city andcounty as far as Big Cottonwood turned out during this month to finish thecanal, or a channel through it so as to bring ^the water from^ Big Cottonwood to this cityto save our crops and gardens. President Young has been upon the canala good deal for 3 weeks past. The embankments have broken out severaltimes; but said water has now been brought as far as Big Kanyon Creekand is watering the 10 and 5 acre lots; this is saving many hundreds ofacres of grain which were drying up for the want of moisture: I don'tthink the water in question will be brought to this city this season. Our cropswould never have been better if water had been abundant; many acresare irrecoverably lost for want of it; but on the whole we shall have agood harvest. Some are already cutting barley and even wheat. Thescarcity of bread has been very great, but it will now soon be harvest.We have found an almost inexhaustible Lead mine; Nathaniel V. Jones willtake charge of it, and is preparing men and teams to go there in order todig the ore, run it into pigs, and bring it to this city. ^[might]^ The ore will yield90 per cent of pure lead, which will enable him to offer it in this city, ifin large contracts, at $10 per cart. He has travelled the vein for 70 miles, andBror Jones says it is the greatest vein of mineral discovered in the world, andthat he could sink a shaft 1000 feet without being troubled with water. It is35 miles from Los Vegas and about 500 from this city. 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,Salt Lake City, Utah, July 11, 1888.Elder Frankloin D. Richards,Dear Brother:Enclosed please find correspondencefrom Brother James Dwyer, addressed to myself, and also a copy of a letter addressedby him to Lippincott & Co., and the reply to the same which they sent, concerningan article for Chambers Encyclopedia, upon Mormons and Mormonism.It is very pleasing to notice the inter-est that Brother Dwyer has taken in this matter, as it is of the utmost importancethat a work with so extensive a circulation as Chambers' Encyclopedia should havea truthful article upion us and our religion, if it be possible to get the same in-serted therein. The utmost care should be taken in preparing such an article, andthis comes appropriately within your province and duties. Brother Jaques, no doubt,will be glad to assist you, or any of the brethren whom you may call upon, to getit up in the best literary style, so as to compare favorably with articles uponother subjects. We should be careful not to make it objectionable on account ofany deficiency in literary merit.I shall advise Brother Dwyer that I havereferred this subject to you.With kind regards, Your Brother,Wilford Woodruff.

From this time on wagonscontinued to come to our assistance with clo-thing, ^&^ provisions. From the time we left FortBridger we had about 50 wagons assistingus on to the valley. We buried 68 souls ofthe "Fourth handcart co" between Iowa City &G. S. L. City. The names of all the Bretheren Iam not acquainted with that came to ourassistance but suffice to say the mostof them were on hand & kind to the sick& feeble altho some few were very attentiveto the fair sex.When our company arrived in G.

 dirt, and perhaps without it they would come safe and beof great value to this people.As to News with us, I can only say we have had themost snow we have ever had in the mountains and vallies.8 feet of snow has fallen in this city this winter: it has beennearly 3 ft deep in our streets for a month. On the Islandit has been about 3 ft: all the stock has been brought from there, and a good many from the North, and driven south,and to Rush Valley, where they are doing well. We havenot lost so much stock, as last year, although the snowhas been deeper, but more pains have been taken to save it.We have had the California Mail regular, but no EasternMail for 3 Months.  The Mail for the East started in theearly part of January, but when they got to the top ofthe little mountain they met such a vast body of snow,and one carrier froze to death (not a Mormon) they returned.It has been a general time of health this winter,but very few deaths.The Legislature adjourned to this city, and we heldit here; It was the best Legislative Assembly we haveever held in Utah, we had at least more of the powerof God and the gift of the Holy Ghost with us thanin any former assembly, and I believe we have notcommitted treason unless it was in a resolution thatwas passed, and that was, that both Houses shouldunitedly repent of their sins and be baptized for the remissionof them, and adjourned for half a day, when the wholeassembly went to the font and were baptised and confirmedby the laying on of hands; and I believe every man did

 G. S. L. City Feby. 2 1857Hon. Geo. A. SmithDear Sir,We have not yet received any mail from theEast for the last [blank] months. Mr. Gerrish arrived on the 19th,inst. from the States, reports that an Eastern mail was at the lastcrossing of the Platte on the way here, but when it would be herehe did not know, he was some 15 days from Bridger, there is moresnow in the mountains than we have ever known since we settledthese vallies. Judge Phelps reports 8 feet of snow fallen in this city upto the 24th Jan. and it has lain in our streets between 2 & 3 feet deepfor weeks, the snow is reported 3 feet on the Island, and all the Horsescattle and sheep have been brought to this city, also from the West of Jordan,and taken South, some fed in yards, some taken to Rush valley, wherethey have wintered well, the great amount of snow in the mountains &vallies will thoroughly soak the earth this Spring, there was but little fallwheat put in, in consequence of the earth being a heap of dry dust, and allthe strength of teams employed in the mountains after the Emigration, butwhat was put in has sprouted and grown two or three inches under thesnow. Our Mail for the Eastern States for Jan. was sent out, and theparty got to the top of the first mountain, one of them (not a Mormon)was froze to death, and they returned. We get the California mail monthly,although the last mail, they had to go through a great deal of snow.Fillmore was nearly snowed under, quite a number of the roofs of houseshave fallen in with the weight of snow. Mr. Gerrish brought a letter from Washington directed to Judge Drummond, which it is supposed containscommissions to Mr. Dotson as Marshal, and perhaps to some man as postmaster, but Drummond is in California and the letter will have to go 
 Historian's Office,Great Salt Lake City, June 30th, 1856.Prst. Geog. A. Smith,Dear Sir,I am writing to Prst. John Taylor and J. M. Bernhisel requesting them to sit down in council with you to make out an account of the death of Joseph & Hyrum Smith and the circumstances relating thereto. From the labor you have already had upon that part of the History you are acquainted with the difficulties connected with it. Weare still laboring upon that part of the History, and we almost daily getnew statements from men who were directly or indirectly connected withthe scenes of the last four days of the lives of the Prophet and Patriarch,and many of these accounts are in direct opposition to each other. Wehave the statement of John S. Fullmer, Dan Jones, S. Markham, W. W. Phelps, R. Cahoon, A. C. Hodge, H. Stout, O. P. Rockwell, Wm Clayton, D. B. Huntingtonand others in connexion with Dr. Richards' Journal lying before us, andfind they conflict a good deal. We have forwarded to Elder Taylor the copyof Dr. Richards' Journal in detached sentences, of the account of theinterview which Joseph had with Governor Ford in Carthage Jail, which Iwan him in connexion with yourself to fill up.  I hope Pres Smith youwill lose no time in attending to this matter, as the History must in a measureremain open until we can get your answer, we with you to question brothersTaylor and Bernhisel upon every past point that you deem necessary for the history, and forward to us immediately. It will still be a great deal oflabor to prepare this part of the History for the press, and I deem itvery essential to get every word and action of them or on as far as wecan embody them in the history during the last days of their lives. Iam now spending most of my time in the office. My health is notvery good since my sickness. I still feel the effects of it in my system.

I feel itmy Duty to write a few lines to you till via Calafornia as Iam aware you wish to hear fron us. I will begin by sayingthat we have lost our worthy friend & Brother presidentJ. M.

 Historians Office Great Salt Lake City May 28th 1856Hon G. A. SmithDear SirAs yet I have filled your placeas Historian ownly at a vary poor rate. The day before I partedwith you at the mouth of the canyon I assisted in skining anox which died suddenly & by so doing I became inoculatedwith poison & mortification & it has proved to be the Hardestattack against my life of any thing that I ever put through. I wasnot confined to my bed untill one week from the time Ileft you, in 24 hours after it commenced to work upon my systemas well as my Arm. I could not stand, or speak plain. presidentYoung came Down & laid hands upon me and said I should notDie but live. Elder Thomas Bullock & others administered to me allpromised me life, & I have lived & saved my Arm but I havehad a 3 weeks struggle for it, my Arm mortifyed & the Deadflesh I had cut out, & cut out with Nitrat of Silver, & I am againenjoying quite good health & my arm nearly Healed up but Inconsequence of this I have not done much in the HistoriansOffice up to this date, but I am now calculating to Devotemy time there. I have spent 4 days in the House of the Lord. Sister SmithThe Eastern Mail finally made its appearance in this city onthe 10th inst & brought about half of the mail that has leftIndependence since last Oct. It brought Letters to you fromF. B. Woolley Mason City Virginia, Preston Thomas Texas WmMartindale Texas J Vancott Copenhagen, James Furguson LiverpoolW. W. Allen Texas These Letters are all on file in the office, Sister Smithgave them to me. Elder O Hyde sent a letter to you which [Bonlake] gaveme to Read & I thought she had better send it to you & she did so 
 Your family are all well.The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society have regularweekly meetings, and are exerting their powers to being out the talent,skill, and ingenuity of our Territory to be exhibited at their fair in the fall. We anticipate a splendid display of Home Manufactures;Prest. Hunter is sanguine in the anticipation of a cattle show equal tothose held in the East. The Ladies are manifesting a commendablespirit and believe that in their department this exhibition will notbe behind. I understand the Leather Manufacturers are calculatingon supplying the States with the valley tan, if we may judge fromtheir late representations.You will receive a Programme for the 4th July from the PostOffice; there are to be great doings.The barley harvest has commenced, and the wheat in some placeswill be cut in a day or two, but not before it is wanted.The weather is very dry, and crops in places suffering for lack ofmoisture. Bror. Jonh C. Wright was in the city a day or two sinceand reported that the grasshooppers had eaten up all the wheat forthree miles round Fort Brigham in Box Elder County.We are taking the large tobacco worms from our potatoe vines inthis city by bushels, and feeding them to the pigs and chickens; Inever saw anything like it for quantity.A portion of Jordan Bridge gave way on the 7th inst, and lettingin 13 head of cattle.Brothers Bullock, Grimshaw, Hawkins, Campbell, and Songdesire to be kindly remembered to you; they are all well.for Wilford WoodruffThomas Bullock Clerk 
 We will forward you a hand bill headed "tremendous excitment" concerningthe mail due here towards the last of May. When it did arrive (on the4th June) there were only 26 bags out of 29 for this place which they startedwith from Independence; and to crown all the missing bags containedall the letters except 44; for the clerk at Independence told Leonard I. Smith, who was on his way here from his mission to the Cape of Good Hope,that he had made up from five to ten thousand letters for this Territorywithin a day or two of the departure of the mail in question. This is assingularly mysterious as it is provoking, and demands a prompt andsearching investigation by the Department. Can you set the machinery a-going?Mrs. Bernhisel wished me to say to you that if you sent any draft toMr. Poulter it is with the lost mail, and you would have to send another.Mrs. B. was at my house to day, and all was well with her; she does notget flour enough from the Mill to supply her family with bread. Isupply her with what flour she lacks; this is very strange, as the neigborsinform me that brother Houtz is almost continually selling flour, whichmakes me think there is something wrong in his management of youraffairs in that Mill; according to the last bill I sent you from himthere was some $70 worth of flour your due, admitting that all the billshe brought against you were correct.The Presidency are all well; Presidents Young and Kimball have beenabsent a few days to the Island; they went over on the new boat whichwas filled up for sailing.It is a general time of health. The California Mail arrived on the24th inst; no letters of any amount.  There was an opposition ticket gotup at the Election in San Bernardino by apostate Mormons; they gotabout 30 votes to about 120 of our people. I heard five letters read 
 receive the Holy Ghost.  This act might be construed intotreason, inasmuch as God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost,Repentance & Baptism for the remission of sins is very[un]popular in a National, State, or Territorial capacity, inthe present generation.We have had a great reformation here this winter.  Prest.Young has given a great deal of instruction, which has beenof great service to the Twelve, and all the people.  TheTabernacle has been crow[d]ed to excess this winter, and hundredscould not get in.  Prest Young has not been able toattend at the Tabernacle since the burial of J. M. Grant,until Sunday 1st inst, when he spoke about one hourand a half, to the great joy of the people.  Bro Kimballhas preached for several Sabbaths past with great plainness.F. D. Richards and myself were the only ones of the Twelvehere in the city fall, and we organized the Missionariesand went through the city in every ward preaching the reformationWe attended a meeting almost every night for 3 months.  EldersO. Hyde and L. Snow have been with us during the sittingof the Legislature. O. Hyde has gone South.  We  havehad a glorious winter, the spirit and power of God andthe Apostleship has rested upon us in power, and the vision ofour minds has been opened to see the state and positionof this people, and we have felt like rising up andmagnifying our callings.  The School Houses have been crowded toexcess, and there has been a great deal of good teaching given to the peoplethis winter.  The people are confessing and forsaking their sins, and beingbaptized for the remission of them.  Your families are well so far as I knowYours trulyW. Woodruff

 to him or be opened by Mr. Gerrish or somebody else which they have nota legal right to do, so the thing is in a fix. Mr. Bell gave up theoffice of post master, and so it has remained in Judge Smith's handswhere it ought to be. Our Legislature closed on the 16th, Jan. we havehad the best Session ever held in this Territory, done up all the businessright, and were of one heart and one mind, and do not think thatwe have committed treason in only one thing, and that was in passingan act that the whole Legislature should repent of their sins, and bebaptized for the remission of them, and adjourned for half a day and repairedto the font and were all baptized and confirmed and I believe every onereceived the Holy Ghost, this might be construed into treason as the Lordthe Holy Ghost, baptism and repentance are all very unpopular throughoutthe world in a Legislative capacity, yet I do not think that itcould legally be made out to be treason either by the constitution orlaws of the United States, organic act, or laws of this country, yetCongress may disannul the act, all except the receiving of the Holy Ghostthat the members have received and it cannot be taken from them ifthey do their duty.As touching the Historian office, I will say that we have notdone much during the sitting of the Legislature, but we are at it again,on the 30th. the Presidency sat and heard the history read up to theorganization of the church in Nauvoo, 8th day of August 1844; alsoPresident Young's life up to the same date. we have wrote a short sketchof the life of each of his brothers, also bro. Kimball and are pickingup the life of the Twelve to follow in that stage of the historybringing them all up to the same date 8th Augt. 1844.The Reformation is still continuing in this city and Territorywith great interest. President Young has given much valuable teaching tothe Twelve and others during this winter, the Spirit and power of God

 Hon. J. M. Bernhisel G. S. L. city Feby. 2 1857.Dear Sir,We have not received an Eastern mail for somethree months, we sent out the Jan. mail for the East, they got to the topof the first mountain and found much snow, and one of the company froze todeath (not a mormon) and the company returned, we have received the Californiamail regularly up to this time, but the last mail had to come throughmuch snow. we are not looking for another Southern mail daily, we havenever seen as much snow in these mountains and vallies in any season sincewe have been here, over eight feet has fallen in theis city, and the mountainsare full, the snow has been for weeks between 2 & 3 feet deep in this city,about 3 feet on the Island, all the stock has been brought from there andtaken south and fed at home and some sent to Rush valley where the stockhave done well, there has been but little stock lost this season. businessis very dull this season not much money in circulation, most all goodsthat are sold among the merchants have to be sold for stock or grain.I have not taken either, and have sold but few goods, your familyare all well and doing well as far as I know, It is a general time ofhealth, we adjourned the Legislature to this city as you have heard, wehave had the best season we have ever had in this Territory.Our reformation has continued with great interest throughout thiscity and Territory, the Twelve have been at the head of the Missionariesand I have attended some meeting about every night for the last 3 months,F. D. Richards & myself have been the only ones of the Twelve here, exceptO. Hyde & L. Snow who have been with us during the Legislature. O. Hydehas gone South, & L. Snow to Box Elder. I forwarded to you last Falla letter to assist me getting some grafts from Wm. R. Prince & Coy.Flushing New York. I never heard from you whether you received it or 
 last Sunday night in council from Lyman Wight to Father Porter, tryingto establish that the true church is with him upon the common stockprinciple.P. P. Pratt has just returned from a Mission south as far as WashingtonCounty; all well south.The eastern mail ^arrived^ on the 28th inst; it brought but few letters, andthe Letter mail bags which were missing of last mail are not heard from, and probably never will be. I received a letter from you, and inreply would say I have paid Miss Burbage all demands up to this date.She is now married to John V. Long the Reporter, but still keeps schools.I will keep you advised of all matters pertaining to the Mill as faras I get them. Bror. Houtz has made some drafts on you, but he is stillowing you as you will see from the Bill I sent you by the 1st June mail.Mrs. Pratt put into my hands a letter from Dr. Asa Fitch directed to O. Pratt by your introduction. He wishes some one to send him somegrasshoppers and other insects from this Territory; they are very scarce thisseason, but I think by diligent search we ^can^ find enough to supply his demand.I remain Dear SirWith great respectYour friendWilford Woodruffby Thomas Bullock.

Broth Maughn of E T City hasfound a Led Lead on the Ridge between our city & Toella vally they brought many sample to the president, supposed to contain 60 percent of pure lead. we have a splendid sample of 3 1/2 lb it is said to ^it contains^90 per cent pure led ^Lead^ this was brought, 50 miles south of Los Vagusbrought ^sent^ By John Steel, their is a mountain of it. N. V. Jones has startedto examine it & to commence smithing it. Elder McCarthy who was shipwreckedon one of the Society Island has baptized the Interpeter to the King whoHe speaks 12 Languages, also the Interpeter to the Government companyHe speaks 5 Languages. He ordained them both Elders & started theGospel in the midst of the people, so it was not in vain withoutsome good that He was shipwrecked. I wish our Deligates toWashington could pull some wire that would work a chargein the Mail operations for Utah for after waiting fromOctober to the 10th of May for a Mail, 24 bags of mailmatters near one half Due is still back to fill up andHoles, or for some other purpose. Broth Bullock says that the U.S.has been Delivered of half a mail & being 5 month old looks for theother half to be born out of Due time but when we cannot tellMr McGraw has had an increase of 17000 Dollars to Reimburse himfor his hard labour & has his contract increased to 35000 toindorse him to be Delivered twice a year as we suppose The clerkof General Store has Reported that that the carrier informed him thathis orders were from McGraw that when He started with the SaltLake mail & came to any streams that was high not to attempt tocross it but to Return to Salt Lake untill the waters was down 
 has rested upon him and his spirit has been more church than ever,and his heart made more glad than ever before, in seeing the Saintsarise to a sense of their duties. The people throughout the Territoryare arising en masse to their duty, in confessing and repenting of theirsins, the Tabernacle is filled to overflowing through these winter monthsand hundreds have to leave each Sunday that cannot get in, ElderKimball has preached the last few Sundays in the greatest plainnesswithout any regard to false traditions of the people, the power ofGod has rested upon him. The Twelve have gone forth throughthis city under the direction of Prest. Young and stood at thehead of the missionary operation, and attended all the Quorummeetings of the Seventies, High Priests, Bishops & Ward meetings,and the power of God has rested upon us, as never before, & the peoplebegin to realize in a measure that there are apostles in their midst.I have attended a meeting of some kind almost every evening for thepast three months, and I have never felt as much of the Spiritof God as during this Winter. I labored with J. M. Grant untilhe died, I then labored in company with F. D. Richards, after hecame home & finally O. Hyde & L. Snow both arrived in this city andthey labored with us a short time. Elder Snow has gone up to BoxElder, and O. Hyde has gone South to hold meetings, and get somethingto help himself with. All our ward school houses are filled to overflowingduring the worst weather and even could you now attend a meeting inProvo, you would be astonished to see hundreds of people striving to geta seat in their places of worship, and should a notice be given out thatGeo. A. Smith would preach in that place, instead of seeing the coldnessthat was formerly manifest almost the entire people would flock out tohear.

 Great Salt Lake City U. T. March 323rd 1856Elder TaylorDear SirI have received a mission tothe States this spring the object of which is to get a fontof type east in the letter of the Deseret Alphabet & then to getsome school books printed in the same. President Young wishesme to get this work accomplished so that some of the Bookscan be brought to this city next fall. I hardly think itcan be accomplished in time to get Books through this seasonbut I do not know. I will start out with the missionariesthat go east this spring but I do not think that we can get any beforethe first of May the mountains are so full of snow we cannottravel. I wish you would do me the favor to make Enquirywhare you think we can get this job done to the best advantageie to get the type made, the printing will of course be an after considerationI have thought we could get the type cast in Cincinnati orNew York as well as any place. when it comes to printing we oughtto have one or two of the Bretheren engaged in it who are printers thatwould be interested in it as it will be in a New Letter & will requireconsiderable time & attention in the type setting & proof Reading &cAfter getting what information you can upon these matters fromthe type fonderies in New York Cincinnati &c you will do me afavor by forwarding a letter to me Directed at Cin St Louis Mo 
 Historian's Office Great Salt Lake City, May 29th 1856Hon. John Taylor,I presume you will not have any objection to receiving amonthly letter from me now I have entered upon my duties as Historianand therefore commence by saying I am just recovered from a four weeks'sickness caused by the poisonous virus inoculating my arm when skinningan ox which had died very suddenly; it came very near carrying me intoanother state of existence, but by kind attention, frequent administrations, andthe continued prayers of the saints my life is spared to continue my labors onthis earth.On the 10th of this month our eyes were astonished to see a U. S. mailcome into the valley from the east loaded with about one half of theletters and papers that had left Independence since last October; theremainder, Mr. McGaw (the contractor) or his agent had very consideratelycached by the way, or perhaps left at Fort Laramie for worn out, tiredout soldiers to read through the long winter nights, when tired of talking abouttheir victory over a few semi savages, and half starved ignorant remnantsof Indian tribes, and they would also naturally be anxious to read thecorrespondence of a people who believe in Polygamy.Although I write you under this date it is impossible to prophesy when youwill receive it, as I learn from a reliable source that Mr. McGaw told hisagent that when he came with the mail from Salt Lake if he came toany stream that was deep not to attempt to cross it, but return to Salt Lakeagain, and stay until the waters are down, for it would be all right, asthe government had reimbursed Mr. McGaw $17,000 this trip, and$35,000 for last contract. I do not vouch for this, but give it you asI received it, and it is casually believed here. When the MormonBoys, Decker, Young, Hanks, Little &c. carried the mail to Laramie

I wrote you upon the subject of nygoing East to get a font of type made in the Deserett Alphabet& some Books printed in that letter.

 up all the Quorums of the Church, especially the Seventies anddropping the members who have stood for years as a dead letterupon the books, but have not reported themselves to their Presidents,the Spirit and power of God has been like fire shut up in ourbones this winter, and the vision of our minds has been openin a measure to the importance of magnifying our calling in thePriesthood, and building up the kingdom of our God. We are thinkingof taking a tour North as far as Salmon river Settlement &c.,in the Spring instead of going South as we have done in formerseasons. We are now having a great thaw, and the streets are filledwith Snow broth, and some places are getting bare and the stock willsoon live, but few of the stock have died this winter in comparisonwith what we lost last Season. It is a general time of health thiswinter but comparison with what very few deaths. Your family are allwell and the families of all the brethren with you in the States.There is one thing I wish you to do for me and for the benefitof the people in this Territory. we have received the Pamphlets con-taining the account of the Diascorea batatas or new chinese Potatoe as[1 1/6] now growing in the garden of Wm. R. Prince & Coy. [company] Flushing N. Yrif one fourth is true that is told of that vegetable it will be ofgreat benefit to us in this Territory, I wish you to see that $5worth of the Tubers either through J. M. Bernhisel, J. Taylor, oryourself or through any body else that you can do the businessthrough & I will pay your family in the money or anybody thatyou will direct, the tubers can be packed in a tin case and directedto W.

 many persons are nearly ruined. The Church had last October over2600 head in Weber and Cache Counties; now they can count nearly500; Gilbert & Gerrish had 700 head when they started from the Missouririver, now they have 95. Messer. Kerr lost their entire herd, valuedat $60,000, and all the citizens in proportion. Hundreds of personshave lived on dead cattle when the could be got at for snow, and nowit has disappeared they are living on weeds, roots, and greens.Although we have had the grasshopper plague, and the excessive drouthof last summer, and the unparalelled severe winter, now they havedisappeared, every face is beaming with gladness, because the handof the Lord has been seen in his mercifully sending the rains once aweek this Spring, which causes the wheat to rise from the ground as a harbinger of "the good time coming boys;" many are anxiously expectingto cut wheat by the 20th June, and then we'll have a jubilee.The Potatos, Corn, Squash, Peas, and other vegetables look well, andwe expect to reap a bountiful harvest to feed those who are here, andthose who are wheeling the barrows over the plains; so be of good cheer,all is well in Zion.I am happy to learn that your agents have obtained subscribersfor 780 out of the 800 copies of the Mormon sent here; it is a truly valuablepaper, and merits an extensive circulation. It is highly approved here,and if the people could be assured of the mail bringing what is sent atUtah, you would have a more extended patronage. We wish you topreserve a good file for the Historian's Office, and bring it with you, or sendby some trusty elder when he emigrates to the valley of peace, havingpreviously got it well bound.Yours truly,W. Woodruff 
 The past year has been a severe time with the peoplein this Territory the crops being nearly all cut all last sumer bythe grasshoppers and the winter has been so cold that I wouldjudge that 3/4 of all the stock in the whole Territory are Dead, & nearlyall the Sheep, almost every thing in the Northern part of the Territory is dead,but vary few of the people in the Territory have bread to eat, & their does notappear to be animals Enogh left in the Territory to plough theground. snow is still lying on the ground North of Davis County 18 inchsdeep. we had a few heards of cattle & sheep in ceder valley & on south alive& the Indians came & stole them & drove them onto the Desert &killed some 8 or 9 men a few of the cattle were retaken but itis said they have drove away some 200 & 300 Head of cattle & Horseswe have been informed that their was but few Indians ingagedin it, most of ^the Indians^ them are friendly but they as well as the whiteshave to dig Roots this spring in order to live.

 Brother Orson I not {shorthand} trouble you to prove a few lines from my ^own^ pen And if you can get along with it as well as Broth John Taylor did with one bro G. A. Smith you will do well for He presented the Letter to 3 men an English French & Jerman soldiers in orderto try to find out what Language it was written in & ther was not a man in New York that couldtel what it was they could not guess out but 3 words in the Letter & they wrote back & asked him if they had guessed right the final Decison was that it was cause trusts enough of thenew to the subject.what I shall now say to you I do upon the principles of doing unto you as I would wish to be done by. And that in concerning your family affairs that part of your family that live in the 19 ward have been Entering complaints against your first wife & in a measure against you for not providing better for them. the Bishop of the ward took up the subject & I then furnished them with some promisthey who applyed to the tithing office & drew from there ^some [of] the^ Men promiswhile they were drawing at the same time from Mrs pratt they finally Entered complaint to the president giving him a Bill of what they had received (as they say)& also saying that sister pratt Had received $600 from Liverpool & would not providfor them &c the consequence was that Elder Hyde in conexion with F D Richards & myself was called upon to call the family together & investigate the matter Elder Hyde & myself Attended F. D. Richards did not but I told them both my feelings upon the subject. I was somewhat accqainted with sister pratts cause in the matter. Brother Hyde has Had one side of the question I the other I told him He would find two sidesto it, when we met we did. I think all the family from the 19 ward manfested a bad spirit & badly misrepresented things. It was then clearly shown that there was not but a small portion of the provisons & things in the Bill which they received & it was also shown that it was not true that sister pratt had received $600 from Liverpoolbut it questioned the $400 ofCredit of Hooper store & that mostly went to pay Debtsformerly contracted, and I Belive Brother Hyde was satisfied that they had a bad spirit & misrepresented sister pratt. we both gave them good council I told them they should act for your interest & maintain your honour while you was gone. I told them if they did not unite with sister pratt & try to get along wiell they would not prosper but would bring trouble upon themselves. I felt & do believe that sister pratt is doing all she can to make them comfortable and I do not think that there was any occasionto make the complaints they have. I think they had a Bad spirit & did not act for your interest as they should have Done in your Absence I went to Brother Hill in the tithing office & told him How things were & He Refused to let them have any more flour because they were Drawing their weekly rations for foursince they found we were investigating the matter closely (inasmuch as they had laidit upon us) they have ben still & I have heard Nothing from them for a month Iunderstand that Marion & perhaps another one is going South perhaps to Filmore

It is a general timeof health we are now beginning to have very hot and dryweather though we have had more rains than we have knownany spring before wheat, grass, corn and potatoes are growing veryfast it is thought that some will begin to cut wheat by the20th of June.

 we got the bags, but they have not got their pay for it. Oh consistency!has thou entirely fled from the United States? if so, when wilt thou return?The difficulties of crossing the rivers are really awful, for a very respectablelady over 70 years of age has started with oxen to go the Missouri river,and I think Mr. McGaw is sadly to blame in not engaging her to carrythe mail, and then pay her for the odd trip. Brother Taylor, can youinform me how it is that your letters via South Pass, and your Duplicatesby way of California, all come in the same letter bag? Your lettersare not the only ones that so strangely come together.Your letter to Bishop Hunter was read in the council last Sunday;all were glad to hear from you, and suppose 'ere this you have learnedyour destinyâ€”that you have to stay at Washington a little longer; weall pray that you and your colleagues may be prospered in your exertionson behalf of the fair vales of Deseret, and that you may win laurels foryourself and co-workers with you.I am happy to inform you that all your family are well; Sister Taylorvisited me the other day in good health and spirits.The Presidency and Twelve are wellâ€”also their families, with the exceptionof Sister Mary Ann Young who is now prostrated through her continuedexertions in administering to the necessities of so many who were destitutethis past season; she is a little easier to day.We learn by Madam Rumor that General Harney has been orderedby the Government to march his troops to the scene of the Indian Warsin Oregon, and that he expects to replenish his supplies when passingthrough the Northern part of this Territory; if this is true he is boundto be disappointed, for the severe winter has killed four out of everyfive head of cattle in the Northern Counties; the desolation is deplorable,

 G. S. L City 3 July 1856Ed of Western StandardI continue my monthly correspondencefor your paper.The Weather has been dry and warm since I lastwrote to you. we have had 2 slight showers during the pastmonth. Barley harvesting commenced last monday the 23rd andsome wheat in the big field was cut on Saturday last. Muchof the crops however have suffered materially for the lack of water;by good management and much physical labor the waters of the Big Cotton wood have been brought Northward as far as Kanyoncreak by way of the canal, and have been used on the10 and 5 acre lots, which will help some fields of grainthat would have been almost an entire failure; br J. Wrightreports the wheat crops for 3 miles around Fort Brigham completelyeat up by Grasshoppers. The tobacco worm in greatnumbers are eating up the Potatoe vines, but we manageto kill them, for they soon grow so large they are easilyseen. Many fields of wheat look well and the city Gardenspromise much, but city kanyon creek is very low.The arrangements of the committee for the nationalcelebration of the 4th of July, have been made on a large scale.We will have a grand military Review and the Legion aremaking preparations accordingly. A copy of the programme hasbeen forwarded to you by the post office.Prests. Young and Kimball have just returned fromspending 3 days on the island examining their stock.

Weconsider this a great blessing to our thriving Territory.It is a general time of health, but great scarcity ofbread, but we look forward for the coming harvest to re-lieve the wants of the people.The Presidency and Twelve with their families areall well.yours truly,W. Woodruff[P]S. Bro: Cannon I have a fine orchard of 50 seedlingapple trees growing, about one half of them begin to bearfruit for the first time this season.

 Great Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, May 29th 1856Hon. Sir,The only mail from the east by way of the South Pass since last October arrivedhere on the 10th. inst, and brought us your favor of the 14th Feby last, which in take the earliestopportunity of answering. We shall take great pleasure in laying your esteemed communicationbefore the Society at our next meeting, and in making such arrangements as will ensure asfar as possible the fulfilling of your requests. We have a great variety of cactuses, someof which bear beautifully scented flowers of scarlet, purple, yellow, and white; the conesvary in size from an apple to over 60 inches in circumference, and  bear a fruit which muchresembles the flavor of the mellow gooseberry. We have also in the southern portion of our ter-ritory several varieties of the Agave or Soap Plant.The almost inaccessible mountains are covered with many varieties of Pines, Balsams,Firs &c; among others we have the Pinyon Pine, which exudes a gum universally used by thenatives, and now by many whites, for its healing properties. The Pinyon Pine is a dwarf tree,its foliage measured through horizontally generally exceeding in diameter the height of thetree; in its early growth it takes the shape of a haycock, and eventually that of an expandedumbrella; it seldom exceeds 20 feet in height, and the berry or nut being nutritious is gatheredby the natives for sustenance, the last resembling that of the filbert. We have also the Redand white Cedar in immense quantities. Our Mountain Maple differs from all the varietieswith which we are acquainted; it is a very hard grained wood, and seldom exceeds a footin diameter. But the greatest curiosity of its kind is the Deseret Mountain Mahogany; itis the heaviest, hardest, and finest of any wood we have seen, being very close grained, andcapable of a very fine polish; the colors are intermixed throughout from a dark brown tonearly white; it is a scarce tree, being found in but few localities. The Box Elder is abeautifully grained wood, much resembling the Bird's eye Maple, and is used for secretaries,Tables &c; this tree is found more or less throughout the Territory, but in the greatest quantityabout 70 miles north of this city, giving the name to Box Elder County. Although we arewriting on "Royal Oak day", we cannot boast much of our oaks in this territory; there arebut few, and then mostly of a scrabby stunted growth.

 of choice apple cuttings, or any good fruit, so I can graftnext Spring and send me the names of the varieties andtheir numbers, and if some thrifty cuttings would retain theirbuds live to be set this season so I could bud from themI would be glad, but I do not know whether buds wouldlive or not after a voyage by mail; but we know thegrafts would in the Spring, but for grafting they will wantto be cut in December or January I suppose or sometimein the winter. I feel anxious to get some fruit from theStates and those that are now growing in this city willnot do to bud from this Season.W.W

 We find in our caÃ±ons, or ravines, in great abundance, a shrub, the fruit of which from itsusefulness to us when we had no cultivated fruit, we call the Service berry; this fruit isabout the size of the black currant, but not quite so juicy, though of much richer flavor,and very nutricious; it forms a considerable portion of the food of the natives duringthe autumnal and winter months. The white settlers form pleasure parties, and go into thecaÃ±ons to spend a few days during the season in gathering service berries, which theydry and lay up for winter use. If properly dried the fruit preserves its qualities throughoutthe year. We have also two varieties of a very prickly shrub, bearing a small acid berry,some red and some yellow; this we call the Buffalo berry, and it makes a good wine.The shrub grows to the height of about 8 feet.You may not be aware that the 22nd of July 1847 was the first day that the van of thepioneers of civilization entered these valleys, about 130 in number, and among whom were yourcorrespondents; that on the 23rd the first plow was put into the ground to tear up the virgin soil;and therefore you will have to make allowances for our imperfect knowledge of all the varietiesof flowers, fruits, and shrubs. On account of the scarcity of food in 1848, the people madeuse of a root called the Sego, or "Calochortus Lateus"; this is a bulbous root from the size ofa pea to that of the walnut, and grows in immense quantities; the flower much resemblesa delicate tulip. There is another description of the Sego which is a deadly poison.There is also an abundance of the Phaca Mollissima in this territoryâ€”a veryneat flower; and many pretty flowers and grasses peculiar to this mountainous country, thescientific names of which we are unable to give at this time. We shall feel gratified insending you the various specimens, and feel under many obligations for your kind offerto name many of them, and to form a floral list for Deseret; and we are awarefrom the delightful opportunities you have in the Royal Gardens, that you can conferon us many lasting favors, which will be appreciated not only by us a people butby our posterity. We deem that it may not be uninteresting to you to know that wehave very choice varieties of wheat, viz, Taos, Club, and Scoca headed, which are

It was indeed Novel forward to hear theGovrner prepare such  Articles to be Read seeing that theywere mostly aimed at his private ^& pertler^ Character but this ownly shows the consciousness he possesses of the Rectitude of the pathswhich He persues & the confidence he has in the people whom He leads, & there is not a child 10 years old in this citybut what knows that what was prnted & Read against us, wasa Buch of lies that dogs Ready told us more news aoutourselves as a people & our Governer in perticular than we ever expet to see fulfilled in our day & Generaton.

 2nd page to Ozem WoodruffAnd considering that you are alone in this work that there is no Saintswith you it is wonderful to me that you can keep the faith at all when ther is so much Darkness to oppose you. I feel to pray the Lord to Bless & Strengthen you, yes uncle Ozem maintain your faith untill Death & God will give you a crown of life if the cau[s]e you are enga[ge]d in is not of God ther is none on Earth that is of God I know it is of God & it is a source of Great consolation to me to know that I have ^any^ of myKi[n]dred who will met me in the Celestial Kingdom of God, our work will soon be closed here we shall meet the other side of the vail soon then we shall get our reward for maint[ain]ing the faith & we shall be satisfiedwith it. I feel like living my religion & Dying for it if necessary. Life is of no value to me at the sacrifice of salvation & the favor of God in the Eternal world. I know the cause that we are Engaged in if God and all the world is opposed to us & would ann[i]hilate us if they hadpower, the same Hatred malace & lies is manifest agst us that was manifest agst the old proph[et]s & Jew & the Apostles. I hve a great Desire to be faithful in my generation as th[e]y were in theirsthe Heathen rage & the people imagine vain things, but in the own  Due time of the Lord, He will leave them in Demise & Laugh at their calamity. the signs of the times are big with Events. there is waiting memisery & Death await the world. And No mistake about it, the signs of the times show it very plain. As to the Legistators of Utah being all [cripels/criminals] & near sighted & h[av]ing so many wives there is none of it trueno more than a thousand other things that is told about us. It is true thatmen here do have more wives than one, & so did Abraham & the oldprophets the fathers of the faithful, in whose bosom the Christian world expect to to rest & when they get there if they ever do they will find Abraham with all his wives & children is the family organization of the celestial world therwere was a reason why Abraham & the Ancient Saints & Apostles had more than one wife that they might raise up a Holy seed unto God who shouldbear the priesthood & build up the priesthood Kingdom & know God it isso now the Lord has revealed this prinsiple & commanded his servants in some instan[ces] to take more than one wife for there are many Noble spirits in the presence of God who hve got to take tabernacles on Earth before the coming of Christ it is the will of God that these spirits should take tabernacles through the Holy priesthood instead of taking tabernacles through the wickedwhere th[e]y would be taught & led to fight against God by their parents so that

 against the mormons & create News for the papers without anyRegard to what the consequences might be whether it cost the livesof one man or a thousand. As to Drummond his History in Utahin some measure has already been told He leaveshis wife & children at home & starts for Utah as a UnitedStates Judge to Judge the people & set them an Example forMorals. But He having been informed by some former officialsthat Utah was a hard place for Men of Leasure He picks himup a Miss in due time before He leaves St. Louis & He brings that Miss with him & keeps her with him in all hisas an assitent in all of his Official Labours in Utah & thatto under the Honorable title of Mrs Drummand. But whenMrs Richards living near this City who is a sister of the Real Mrs. Drummond called to pay her sister a visitShe beheld a woman which she had never before seen andhad to turn away in Disgust from one who may cometo regulate the mind of Utah. And after clearing uptrying to put the Capitol of the Territory under Marshall Law& having men carried a hundred miles in Juries  & brought beforehis honour for utering the treasonable opinions that Neitherthe Constitution & nor laws of the United States Requireda United States Judge to have a Miss sit with himupon the Judgement Seat in order to make his acts legal,which cause he persued as many can testify & after going to Calaforinia & publishing his charge to the Jury of lawfully which He ner Delivered to them. He then Returningto the United States & writes his Resignation & tellsthe awful tails Murder & crimes of which GovernerYoung & the mormons were guilty, which has set all the world in a foam but while Doing this He shouldhave waited a little Longer before He went so near hisReal wife as to cause her to go to pay him a visit &while seaking an interview with him He hastens to herher Home & steals some of the children & carried them offbefore she Returned so the Michigan paper paper publishedin his Neighborhood rep & off course they would not say anythingabout him but what was true

 this is the man that writes to swallow up Utah& build a gallows to Hang the Governr & all his truefriends upon But by way of conditions concerning him I wouldask ^how^ what will the Hon Judge disperse of his two Mrs DrummondsReal living wives immorals as He is inspired with such HolyHonor against the mormons for Having more than one wifeOr is that ^become^ admissible in the Christian world in this lastage of civilization & Refinement with all men inasmuch as theyare not mormons. We would like to be informed upon this poi[n]tas we have been so long from the civilized world that we may be ignorant upon some of the po[i]nts of improvementThis is one singular characteristic with all men who eithr go outof Utah or go through it who are Enemies to this people & thatis they just barly escape with ther lives yes they do Reallyescape with their lives & so many of them of ^them^ to, this is singularwhn we consider that the mormons are such a Desperate Blodthirsty people as our Enemies would fain make world belevebut would there characters report this & feel this way if they didnot really Believe that if Justice had ben done thenthey never would have left utah with ther lives I thinknot. But really has they not any body ben killed inUtah. If there has not ^been^, I think the people are sadly toblame for since the opening of the Gold milnes of Calafornia thewhole country from Calafornia to Oregon has been so rifled withMurderers & Robers & thievs that the good Christian people ofCalafornia have found it necssary to shout & find therescores & Hundreds without Judge or Jury acording to Law & noone has called them in question for it as told the Govenorresopnsible for it, & it would be strange if ther was not anyone in Utah that should get killed without Judge or Jurybut then I will acknowledge ther is a great Diffence forthe people in Utah are mostly mormon & they have amormon Governor & the Christins would of come [throh]that a Mormon Governor be held Responsible for thedeath of any man & evry crime committed in his territorywhile any man would at once be comitted fo & that Justly toownly ben for the Insane Hospital who should make any such

 Demand or Require any such Responsibility of any Governor in any state or territory. but this is an item of Difference between Mormon & Antemormans. there is more crime committed in oneday in many Cities of the United States with the same ^amount^ [illegible]of population than ther is in Utah in ^a^ years, but that is performed by Chistains & also by Mormons that makes the Differnce. If we are overtaken in a fault & do any thing wrong in Utah we confess our sins & learn to forsake them & thank our ^governor or any other fr[ien]d^ frends for telling us our faults, Realizes that the Rebukes of a frend are better & far more profitabe than the kisses of an Enemy, but in the chrstian world the people labor Diligently to hide ther faults, & if the Governor of Calafornia, New York, or Connecticut was to tell the people ther faults & show them ther sins they would considerhimself ^themselves^ very fortunate ^to^ escape withot being puled down or having therthroat cut. The Question is often asked what is going to be donewith Utah & what will the people of Utah do.  Now this Dependsentirely upon circustances The inhabitants of Utah know well as a people that they have broaken No law either Human or Divine the Laws & Constitution of the United States garentee unto us all that we have Either Realized or asked for & if the Goernment of the United States persues a lawful & Legal cause towards us ther will never be any Difficulty betwen Utah & the General Government. & it is certainly Hardto believe that the Goverment will has arrived at that state of Decline or Deacay that she would be willing to Risk the Result & future consequences of steping out side of the Constitution and opening a war of Pesecuton & extermation against any state or territory because of ther Religious faith orpractice as long as that faith or practice does not come in contak with the constitutn or Laws of the United States for in that case they might begin to withhold the sympathiesfrom Utah & prepare to weep for thousads & the childen for shouldthey attempt to undermine the constition that Great & Glorious LegacyGiven by God throgh our Fathers unto the American people for the sakeof Gratifying the envy of the Rable for a little Mormon Blod

 ^If the object ^of our Enemies is in there preset objectives [apt to]^ is to destroy Mormonds from off the earth.^I can inform all men that they have undertaken atask which is not in the power of man to Accomplish ^mormonism is the work of God & when men fight against it they fight god Here this covenant prevail^for should they ^our Enemies^ ever Destroy the little handful of 800,000 riverliving rivers in Utah that would not begin to stop the mormonismfor the Elders of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints are scattered throghtout nearly the whole Earth & wherever theEffort has been made to Destroy us it has added thousads to the Church & all men will find this to be the case unto the End. And all men will find, Even Emperors, Kings, Rulers,Princes, presidets, Governors, Judges, Doctors, Lawyers, prints & Editors & all Nations of men that ^The Rulers & people of the whole Earth will find^ before they have fully destroyed Mormonism from off the Earth or killed half of the mormons in Utah Territory, that they will have as much as they can called to do to attend to ther own heads& meet the coming storms which is nigh Even ^at^ their own Doors and all men will find this to be trueAnd I wish to bear my testimony unto all men unto all men unto whom these lines may come that the ^for the^ God of Heaven has a controversy with this Generation & is about to bring judgment upon the world because of that wickednessof man. The Lord Raised up Joseph Smith to bring forth his work He was a true prophet of God & both the Righteous & wicked will find it so when they come to Judgment. He brought forth the Book of Mormon which is a true Record.  The Lord Raised him up to bring forth the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel unto thisGeneration to save the honest & meek of the Earth & the leavethe wicked without excuse in the day of Gods Judgment, & prepare the way for the Coming of the Son of man. He was a good & Elect man & laid the foundation of a great work which Neither men nor Devilscan overthrow.

Woodruff,Dear Brother,Will you permit me to trespassupon a little of your time byasking a few questions uponan important matter, to meat least?They are in relation to theblessing of little children.1st. Is it actually necessaryfor the Saints to take theirChildren to the fast meetingsto have them named and blessed?2nd. Is it not the fathers right 
 and privilege to bless his ownoffspring. and in case he doesnot take them to fast meetingto have them blessed againwill they be cut short of anyblessings in the great eternitybefore us?None of my children havebeen blessed in fast meeting,their grandfather (the lateBp. E. D. Woolley,) blessed allthat were born prior to hisdeath, and those born sinceI have blessed. I keep afamily record, and give thebranch clerk a copy of the Same.I also babtize my children onthe day that they are eight yearsold. Am I right on these matters. Please answer if youhave time, and obligeYour brother in the gospel,Joshua R. Clark.
