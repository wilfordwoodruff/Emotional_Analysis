I received  my notice for a Mission to the South-  ern States, and am quite willing to  go.

If this favor  could be granted it would be very   satisfactory. If not granted  please answer by Telegraph that I   may be ready. Also, should  the above favor be granted kindly  state the time you wish me to be in   Salt Lake City. Please answer to   Pine Valley and Oblige. Resp.    Your Bro. in the Gospel    Wm. M. Lloyd

Most of our company  left Boston on the 26th of May in the cars for  Iowa city, price of passage $11.00. We arrivd  at Iowa City June 2nd.

 Historian's Office,   Great Salt Lake City, Jun 30th, 1856.    Bro. Bernhisel,  Dear sir,    We are writing to Elders Geoe A. Smith and John Taylor upon  the subject of the Church History.  We now ask a favor at your hand, viz.  that you will meet in joint council with brothers Taylor and Smith, and  assist them in making out a precise account of what took place in jail  and in going to Carthage &c. We feel that it is due Joseph Smith and the  Church and Kingdom of God, and to all future generations that we embody  every act and word in the History of the last days of the Prophet, and we  have no way to obtain them only by application to Elder John Taylor,  and yourself, in connection with one or two other individuals who were with  Joseph and Hyrum during their last days. We feel great difficulty in making  out the history of Joseph during the last three or four days of his life; many  statements are entirely opposed to each other; for instance, Sister Taylor  says that Sister Hyrum Smith and herself got a man who was living at  Wm Marks's to draw up a petition to the Governor to restore those men in  prison to their wives and children; this was signed by Sister Hyrum Smith,  Sister Taylor &c &c, but when presented to Emma she utterly refused to  sign it. On the other hand Wm Clayton says he was sent for by Emma  when he was listening to Govr Ford's speech, and wrote out the petition  himself at her request, and that she was the first to sign it.  The  petition was presented to the Governor as soon as he had done speaking;  he read it, looked down to the floor in silence, and did not look at any  one of the petitioners, but finally said, "I will do what I can," and walked  off.  Do you know anything of this matter?    This period of Joseph's History is the most difficult to make out as Dr. Richards  wrote but little, and that in detached sentences, expecting to make it out 
 Our company were Americans, English, Irish,  Welsh, Scotch, & Scandinavians.    As we passed thro. Iowa many of our  company left us to live with the Gentiles.  Our handcarts were of a very poor kind  some of the axels almost wore thro' before  we arrived at Florence.    We arrived on the Banks of Missouri  River August 11th & crossed the river  same day on the steamboat^ferry^boat Nebraska.  Several of our company considering the  journey too tedious left our company at  Florence. When we started for the plains  our company was reduced to about 425  souls, another wagon was given to our com-  pany to haul provisions as we were short of  team, also about 4 yoke of cattle.    We left the little Pappea on the 18th of August  in good spirits, for G. S. Lake. We travelled  along very well till the 3rd of September, when  more than one half of our cattle stampeded  We were then under the necessity of yoking  up some wild Arkansas cows & travelling  the best we could. We made pretty good  headway till we arrived at the upper crossing  of the Platte. Many of our men now  began to get weak, some had died, this  made the duties of the camp to fall on  a few & began to weaken the rugged & the  strong. 
 G. S. L. City Feb. 28 1857    Elders Lyman & Rich  Dear Brethren,    The weather for the past few days has been mild  and warm, snow disappearing rapidly.    The prospects for the agriculturist this season are good. Mountains heavily  covered with snow, the soil deeply moistened with the snow which has lain  all winter but has now dissolved; and the Big cottonwood canal in many  palaces [places] nearly finished, which will bring the along the farming lands and  into the city.    The Board of the Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society  have again commenced their meetings and in this weeks paper have published a  list of premiums; the awards are much higher this year which it is presumed  will have a good effect on the Manufacturing interests of our Territory. The  Bishops are getting their wards together which are generally organized into  branch societies, and in some instances calling upon the people to contribute  their rings, Jewels, watches &c. to send to the States to buy sheep.    Feb. 22 A list of Missionaries for Europe and the Islands was called  off, to which it is anticipated more will be added, there was also read  a list of names called to accompany Prests. Young & Kimball on their northern  trip to Salmon river to start after the April conference.    Br. Lyman, the history of the church is now revised and corrected  up to Augt. 8 1844 when Prest. Young and the Twelve become the Presidency  of the church, at this period the history will commence, and give a brief  account of the parentage, early life, missions and history of each of the Twelve.  We would be pleased to have your history at your earliest convenience, say from  8 to 10 pages foolscap. Br. Rich's history will come in at the date of 
 Presidents B Young & H. C. Kimball has just spent 3  days on the Island among their stock they have 300 Horses  & other stok on the Island, they took their Stock a  sail boat over & back. Elder N. V. Jones has  just Returned from Exploring his lead mine in the  south finds an inexhaustable amount of it will supply  this Territory with it. Evry thing sent in the Letter Mail Bags  that arived the first of June, was lost No letters, but  Mail. the calafornia Mail came in a few days since  brought but vary little News. I find from the Eastern  papers that the war in Kansas seems to continue I see  the Mo Republican published our Deseret Constitution  & can find no fault with it. I have been vary  sick since you left home got poisoned by skinning an  Ox which came near costing me my life. I[t] cost me a  month sickness & I an not Enjoying as good health as I  did before. I learn by your letter that ther is 25000  Head of cattle on the Road & that cattle are for ^$^70 to 90  pr yoke you say that you cannot buy at that price  to buy the woollen factory if not you will the sooner  get through your week & be Ready to start Home    I hope you will get my little Bill of Articles esspecially  the Opeum for Father, as you know how He is when you  get out of medicine.

 Historian's Office G. S. L. City  February 4th 1857.    Elders Lyman & Rich,  Dear Brethren,    I have understood  that you were both expecting to come to this city this spring.  I write to say that we would like to have you bring with  you Indigo seed sufficient to sow one or two acres, if you  could attend to it; also some madder seed, as we wish  to introduce it into the Territory.  I would also like if you  could obtain some Cotton seed for us, we would like to  obtain sufficient to sow five acres; and if the Chinese  potatoes, as advertised in Wm R. Prince & Co's catalogue, of  Flushing, New York, has got into your country, try to  bring a few of them, if it is not more than one or two.  I wish you would try to bring us a few of Hovey's Seedling  Strawberries, as they are counted about the best for producing  I received a few Black Prince Strawberries sent me by—  Bro Wm E. Dodge, but they are reported by Mr Prince, as  being unproductive.  Any good cuttings of apples or any  kind of fruit that you can bring with you will be acceptable,  and any expence that you are at in procuring any kind of   seeds or cuttings we will make good. I received a small  bottle of cuttings, the fore part of winter from Brother Rich which  I shall take great pains to preserve.  Please bear these things  in mind.  I think if a Dozen or two of Hovey's Seedling  Strawberries were put into a little box or can, with a little 
 chalk, alum, and I think he believes  there is salt peter on the islands.    As to what bro. Brown mentions  as having been received from Springville  I know nothing only what is therein  stated. If you can manufacture Gunpowder  and send Prest. Young a specimen it  would be valued highly.    Your account of the cotton district  is very encouraging; many have been  sanguine that cotton could be raised on  the virgin and that there were some  fertile spots on the clara and the  virgin which would raise southern  productions.    Should the Iron roll out half  as fast as your letters talks of and the  cotton country produces according to  your anticipations this inland Territory  is insured of ^enviable^ commercial independence.    Your description of the effects of the  Reformation pleases me; and I can  endorse its truth in my experience  in this portion of the Territory.    We have considerable sugar cane  growing here and anticipate it will  meture in this climate.    Many are cultivating the castor  oil bean and the Hon. J. M. Bernhisel  has sent us some Binney the seed  of which produces the bush or stalk  from which is manufactured the  pure sweet oil.    There is going to be an  excellent crop of fruit here this   season.    If you could manufacture a  specimen of Gunpowder for this seasons  exhibition, it would much please  Bishop Hunter and the Directors of  the Deseret Agricultural & Manufacturing  Society.    yours truly  W. Woodruff  per R. L. C.

 Some of the causes that our people got weak was  they had not enough to eat. From Iowa City  to Florence, we had 10 ozs of Flour per day  & little or no groceries. When we left Missouri  River we had not quite enough provisions  for sixty days at 1 lb pr head each pr day.  We issued 1 lb of flour to each adult & 8 ozs.  to each child per day. About 8 miles west  of Laramie we issued flour as follows 14 ozs.  to each man; 12 ozs to each woman; 8 ozs to  each child; & 4 ozs to each infant per day.    At Independence ^Rock^ we reduced the rations  again Men 10 1/2 ozs flour; women 9 ozs;  children 6 ozs; & infants 3 ozs per day.    We issued the last of our flour out at  the 5th crossing of the Sweetwater. Bro. Willie,  purchased some hardbread at Fort Laramie  this we had on hand on the 19th of October  we met Bros. C. H. Wheelock, J. A. Young & two  other bretheren informing us that G. D. Grant,  & the "Relief Train" was near at hand.  This inspired our company with fresh spirits  that day we travelled about 16 miles with  weary teams & hungry people at our next  camping place we buried nine persons.    The Relief Train came to our assistance  on the 21st of Oct. with provisions & clothing  & bedding & shoes. W. H. Kimball & others  with six wagons returned with us. G. D.

I wish to  inform you & Brother Pratt & friends that we have Lost our worthy friend  & Brother president J M Grant who died Dec 1st & was found  on the forth 4th under Military honors followed by the greatest procession  ever found at a funeral in this vally.  He was sick 10 days, later with the chills  fever, turned to the Billious then the Lung fever. Nothing seem to relieve him from  the time He was first taken. He had a great vision two days before His death  may things were shown him in the spirit world. He has preached in the Reformation  in this City & Territory as though he knew He had but few days to  live. He has lifted up his voice like the trump of an Angel & cryed long & Loud  to the people to Repent & live their Religion. I preume he was welcomed  the other side of the Vail.

 Historian's office  G. S. L. city June 13 1857    Mr. Eliezer Edwards  Dear bro.    Yours of May 21st. has  been received, and I have had much pleasure  and gratification in its perusal.    I passed it over to Prest. Young  from whose clerk T. D. Brown, I received  the accompanying slip for you.    Last evening I had your letter read  to the Board of Directors of the D. A.  and M. Society; all who have heard  your letter read rejoice in the spirit of  it, and are glad there are some in Utah  whose efforts and genius are bent on  making Gunpowder. It is no doubt well  known to you that Gunpowder is one  of the most desirable articles that could  be manufactured in this community, and  one which demands our strictest attention,  and deepest researches.    As to the reports of the discovery of  Salt peter in abundance on Salt Lake islands,  it has arisen probably from Captn. Dan   Jones' discoveries. He has discovered, slate 
 himself, but died before doing it. Now any assistance you can render  to Geor A. Smith in sending us an account of those things that we may make  a correct history will be thankfully received and highly prized. The sooner  this can be attended to the better, as we shall have to wait this information before  we can continue the History.    As to the news of the day we have not much of interest. The drouth has  been great and but little water. Nearly all the laboring men of this city and  county as far as Big Cottonwood turned out during this month to finish the  canal, or a channel through it so as to bring ^the water from^ Big Cottonwood to this city  to save our crops and gardens. President Young has been upon the canal  a good deal for 3 weeks past. The embankments have broken out several  times; but said water has now been brought as far as Big Kanyon Creek  and is watering the 10 and 5 acre lots; this is saving many hundreds of  acres of grain which were drying up for the want of moisture: I don't  think the water in question will be brought to this city this season. Our crops  would never have been better if water had been abundant; many acres  are irrecoverably lost for want of it; but on the whole we shall have a  good harvest. Some are already cutting barley and even wheat. The  scarcity of bread has been very great, but it will now soon be harvest.    We have found an almost inexhaustible Lead mine; Nathaniel V. Jones will  take charge of it, and is preparing men and teams to go there in order to  dig the ore, run it into pigs, and bring it to this city. ^[might]^ The ore will yield  90 per cent of pure lead, which will enable him to offer it in this city, if  in large contracts, at $10 per cart. He has travelled the vein for 70 miles, and  Bror Jones says it is the greatest vein of mineral discovered in the world, and  that he could sink a shaft 1000 feet without being troubled with water. It is  35 miles from Los Vegas and about 500 from this city. 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,  Salt Lake City, Utah, July 11, 1888.    Elder Frankloin D. Richards,    Dear Brother:    Enclosed please find correspondence  from Brother James Dwyer, addressed to myself, and also a copy of a letter addressed  by him to Lippincott & Co., and the reply to the same which they sent, concerning  an article for Chambers Encyclopedia, upon Mormons and Mormonism.    It is very pleasing to notice the inter-  est that Brother Dwyer has taken in this matter, as it is of the utmost importance  that a work with so extensive a circulation as Chambers' Encyclopedia should have  a truthful article upion us and our religion, if it be possible to get the same in-  serted therein. The utmost care should be taken in preparing such an article, and  this comes appropriately within your province and duties. Brother Jaques, no doubt,  will be glad to assist you, or any of the brethren whom you may call upon, to get  it up in the best literary style, so as to compare favorably with articles upon  other subjects. We should be careful not to make it objectionable on account of  any deficiency in literary merit.    I shall advise Brother Dwyer that I have  referred this subject to you.    With kind regards, Your Brother,  Wilford Woodruff. 
 [in red ink]  Feb 17, 1857  Wm Woodard  to  W. Woodruff  [end of red ink]    Independence Rock in search of the rest of the.  Handcart companies, crossing the rocky ridge  we had a tremenduous snow storm the  next morning we buried 13 souls.    Some six wagons came to our assistance at  this place on the Sweetwater; we travelled  on & crossed Green river; the day we left Green  River about 10 wagons from Fort Supply came  to our assistance. From this time on wagons  continued to come to our assistance with clo-  thing, ^&^ provisions. From the time we left Fort  Bridger we had about 50 wagons assisting  us on to the valley. We buried 68 souls of  the "Fourth handcart co" between Iowa City &  G. S. L. City. The names of all the Bretheren I  am not acquainted with that came to our  assistance but suffice to say the most  of them were on hand & kind to the sick  & feeble altho some few were very attentive  to the fair sex.    When our company arrived in G. S. L.  City the Bishops took care of them im-  mediately. Altogether the people of the  4th Hand cart co. have Great reasons to  thank God & the Saints in Utah.    This, or any portion of it is at your service  William Woodward.

 dirt, and perhaps without it they would come safe and be  of great value to this people.    As to News with us, I can only say we have had the  most snow we have ever had in the mountains and vallies.  8 feet of snow has fallen in this city this winter: it has been  nearly 3 ft deep in our streets for a month. On the Island  it has been about 3 ft: all the stock has been brought from   there, and a good many from the North, and driven south,  and to Rush Valley, where they are doing well. We have  not lost so much stock, as last year, although the snow  has been deeper, but more pains have been taken to save it.    We have had the California Mail regular, but no Eastern  Mail for 3 Months.  The Mail for the East started in the  early part of January, but when they got to the top of  the little mountain they met such a vast body of snow,  and one carrier froze to death (not a Mormon) they returned.    It has been a general time of health this winter,  but very few deaths.    The Legislature adjourned to this city, and we held  it here; It was the best Legislative Assembly we have  ever held in Utah, we had at least more of the power  of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost with us than  in any former assembly, and I believe we have not  committed treason unless it was in a resolution that  was passed, and that was, that both Houses should  unitedly repent of their sins and be baptized for the remission  of them, and adjourned for half a day, when the whole  assembly went to the font and were baptised and confirmed  by the laying on of hands; and I believe every man did 
 Historians Office  G S L City Jan 7, 1857    Dear Bro Geo. A Smith,    On the 8th Dec the Legislative  Assembly met in the State House Fillmore, organised  & met in Joint Session, when a Resolution was passed  changing the seat of Government of U. T. ^I adjorned to meet in the Social Hall G S L City on the 18th^ & early next  morning the Members started for G S L City.    On the 29th Dec. El. Orson Hyde arrived from Carson in good  health & spirits: he has been elected Representative  from this County in place of J. M Grant deceased    Messrs C Little & E. K Hanks started from here with  the Eastern Mail on the 10th Dec, & it is needless to say  that these men will carry it through if there is the shadow  of a possibility. Mr Kerr & co. have started with another  this morning    The last of our immigration (Hudgetts & Hunts Cos) arrived  between the 11th & 15th Dec. having dug through snow 15 ft in places    On the 18th The Legislative Assembly convened in the State  Social Hall when the Govs message was read.    Prest Young gave a supper & entertainment to the returned  Missionaries ^& a few others^ at his new residence (the Lion House) on Christmas  Evening    A wrought iron anchor has been made at the Public works  weighing 330 lbs. The iron from which it was made weighed in the  [tire] 525 lbs.    On Sunday Evg Jan 4 18567 Danl H Wells was ordained & set  apart as 2nd Councilor to Prest B Young.    This is the severest winter ever experienced in the Valleys  & there is more snow on the ground than was ever known before  on the night of the 34th snow fell in this city to the depth of 
 G. S. L. City Feby. 2 1857    Hon. Geo. A. Smith    Dear Sir,    We have not yet received any mail from the  East for the last [blank] months. Mr. Gerrish arrived on the 19th,  inst. from the States, reports that an Eastern mail was at the last  crossing of the Platte on the way here, but when it would be here  he did not know, he was some 15 days from Bridger, there is more  snow in the mountains than we have ever known since we settled  these vallies. Judge Phelps reports 8 feet of snow fallen in this city up  to the 24th Jan. and it has lain in our streets between 2 & 3 feet deep  for weeks, the snow is reported 3 feet on the Island, and all the Horses  cattle and sheep have been brought to this city, also from the West of Jordan,  and taken South, some fed in yards, some taken to Rush valley, where  they have wintered well, the great amount of snow in the mountains &  vallies will thoroughly soak the earth this Spring, there was but little fall  wheat put in, in consequence of the earth being a heap of dry dust, and all  the strength of teams employed in the mountains after the Emigration, but  what was put in has sprouted and grown two or three inches under the  snow. Our Mail for the Eastern States for Jan. was sent out, and the  party got to the top of the first mountain, one of them (not a Mormon)  was froze to death, and they returned. We get the California mail monthly,  although the last mail, they had to go through a great deal of snow.  Fillmore was nearly snowed under, quite a number of the roofs of houses  have fallen in with the weight of snow. Mr. Gerrish brought a letter from   Washington directed to Judge Drummond, which it is supposed contains  commissions to Mr. Dotson as Marshal, and perhaps to some man as post  master, but Drummond is in California and the letter will have to go 
 Historian's Office,  Great Salt Lake City, June 30th, 1856.    Prst. Geog. A. Smith,    Dear Sir,    I am writing to Prst. John Taylor and J. M. Bernhisel   requesting them to sit down in council with you to make out an account   of the death of Joseph & Hyrum Smith and the circumstances relating   thereto. From the labor you have already had upon that part of the   History you are acquainted with the difficulties connected with it. We  are still laboring upon that part of the History, and we almost daily get  new statements from men who were directly or indirectly connected with  the scenes of the last four days of the lives of the Prophet and Patriarch,  and many of these accounts are in direct opposition to each other. We  have the statement of John S. Fullmer, Dan Jones, S. Markham, W. W. Phelps,   R. Cahoon, A. C. Hodge, H. Stout, O. P. Rockwell, Wm Clayton, D. B. Huntington  and others in connexion with Dr. Richards' Journal lying before us, and  find they conflict a good deal. We have forwarded to Elder Taylor the copy  of Dr. Richards' Journal in detached sentences, of the account of the  interview which Joseph had with Governor Ford in Carthage Jail, which I  wan him in connexion with yourself to fill up.  I hope Pres Smith you  will lose no time in attending to this matter, as the History must in a measure  remain open until we can get your answer, we with you to question brothers  Taylor and Bernhisel upon every past point that you deem necessary for the his  tory, and forward to us immediately. It will still be a great deal of  labor to prepare this part of the History for the press, and I deem it  very essential to get every word and action of them or on as far as we  can embody them in the history during the last days of their lives. I  am now spending most of my time in the office. My health is not  very good since my sickness. I still feel the effects of it in my system.

 Great Salt Lake City Dec 7th 1856    Hon G A Smith    Dear Sir    The Calafornia Mail came in last  night will go out in th Morning the Eastern Mail has not  came been heard from for two months past. I feel it  my Duty to write a few lines to you till via Calafornia as I  am aware you wish to hear fron us. I will begin by saying  that we have lost our worthy friend & Brother president  J. M. Grant He died Jan Dec 1st 18506 after an Illness of 10 days with  chills & fever then Billious fever termating in th Lung fever. Nothing seemed  to help him for the tine He was taken He had ga great vision two  days before his Death went into the spirit world saw many great & interesting  things we buried him on the 4th under Military Escortt followed by  the greatest processon ever assemled at a funerel in this vally for  particulers see the No 40 of the News. Our last Hand Cart company  are all in sone 80 deaths, many with frozen hands & feet. Thernometer 10 degres  below zero a part of the time on the Journey then some 300 team was sent out to  ther assitance & more thn 100 tons of flour & thir is now 400 at Bridger  that came with ox teams & ther is Now some 60 {shorthand} Hors team gone after the  with some 30 or 40 tons of flour it has cost mere to get in the Emigration  in consequence of th late Starting then is would to have bought them all Hors  team & waggins at St Louis. Their is a great exhertin made  here on the refermation J M Brothe Grant worked & preached himself to  deat as it were. He worked as thogh He knew He had but a few days to live  we feel that we are living in Momentius times both the spirit of God & the devil  is at work in a wonderful maner here. (The Seat of Government will be formed  this winter to Great Salt Lake City untill U. S. makes Approperations  to furnish the State House) all are it is a General time of Health Pre  Joseph Young president of the 70s hs ben vary sick but is getting sone better  winter has set in very cold, & early.

 Historians Office Great Salt Lake City May 28th 1856    Hon G. A. Smith    Dear Sir    As yet I have filled your place  as Historian ownly at a vary poor rate. The day before I parted  with you at the mouth of the canyon I assisted in skining an  ox which died suddenly & by so doing I became inoculated  with poison & mortification & it has proved to be the Hardest  attack against my life of any thing that I ever put through. I was  not confined to my bed untill one week from the time I  left you, in 24 hours after it commenced to work upon my system  as well as my Arm. I could not stand, or speak plain. president  Young came Down & laid hands upon me and said I should not  Die but live. Elder Thomas Bullock & others administered to me all  promised me life, & I have lived & saved my Arm but I have  had a 3 weeks struggle for it, my Arm mortifyed & the Dead  flesh I had cut out, & cut out with Nitrat of Silver, & I am again  enjoying quite good health & my arm nearly Healed up but In  consequence of this I have not done much in the Historians  Office up to this date, but I am now calculating to Devote  my time there. I have spent 4 days in the House of the Lord. Sister Smith  The Eastern Mail finally made its appearance in this city on  the 10th inst & brought about half of the mail that has left  Independence since last Oct. It brought Letters to you from  F. B. Woolley Mason City Virginia, Preston Thomas Texas Wm  Martindale Texas J Vancott Copenhagen, James Furguson Liverpool  W. W. Allen Texas These Letters are all on file in the office, Sister Smith  gave them to me. Elder O Hyde sent a letter to you which [Bonlake] gave  me to Read & I thought she had better send it to you & she did so 
 Your family are all well.    The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society have regular  weekly meetings, and are exerting their powers to being out the talent,  skill, and ingenuity of our Territory to be exhibited at their fair in   the fall. We anticipate a splendid display of Home Manufactures;  Prest. Hunter is sanguine in the anticipation of a cattle show equal to  those held in the East. The Ladies are manifesting a commendable  spirit and believe that in their department this exhibition will not  be behind. I understand the Leather Manufacturers are calculating  on supplying the States with the valley tan, if we may judge from  their late representations.    You will receive a Programme for the 4th July from the Post  Office; there are to be great doings.    The barley harvest has commenced, and the wheat in some places  will be cut in a day or two, but not before it is wanted.    The weather is very dry, and crops in places suffering for lack of  moisture. Bror. Jonh C. Wright was in the city a day or two since  and reported that the grasshooppers had eaten up all the wheat for  three miles round Fort Brigham in Box Elder County.    We are taking the large tobacco worms from our potatoe vines in  this city by bushels, and feeding them to the pigs and chickens; I  never saw anything like it for quantity.    A portion of Jordan Bridge gave way on the 7th inst, and letting  in 13 head of cattle.    Brothers Bullock, Grimshaw, Hawkins, Campbell, and Song  desire to be kindly remembered to you; they are all well.    for Wilford Woodruff  Thomas Bullock Clerk 
 We will forward you a hand bill headed "tremendous excitment" concerning  the mail due here towards the last of May. When it did arrive (on the  4th June) there were only 26 bags out of 29 for this place which they started  with from Independence; and to crown all the missing bags contained  all the letters except 44; for the clerk at Independence told Leonard   I. Smith, who was on his way here from his mission to the Cape of Good Hope,  that he had made up from five to ten thousand letters for this Territory  within a day or two of the departure of the mail in question. This is as  singularly mysterious as it is provoking, and demands a prompt and  searching investigation by the Department. Can you set the machinery a-going?    Mrs. Bernhisel wished me to say to you that if you sent any draft to  Mr. Poulter it is with the lost mail, and you would have to send another.    Mrs. B. was at my house to day, and all was well with her; she does not  get flour enough from the Mill to supply her family with bread. I  supply her with what flour she lacks; this is very strange, as the neigbors  inform me that brother Houtz is almost continually selling flour, which  makes me think there is something wrong in his management of your  affairs in that Mill; according to the last bill I sent you from him  there was some $70 worth of flour your due, admitting that all the bills  he brought against you were correct.    The Presidency are all well; Presidents Young and Kimball have been  absent a few days to the Island; they went over on the new boat which  was filled up for sailing.    It is a general time of health. The California Mail arrived on the  24th inst; no letters of any amount.  There was an opposition ticket got  up at the Election in San Bernardino by apostate Mormons; they got  about 30 votes to about 120 of our people. I heard five letters read 
 receive the Holy Ghost.  This act might be construed into  treason, inasmuch as God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost,  Repentance & Baptism for the remission of sins is very  [un]popular in a National, State, or Territorial capacity, in  the present generation.    We have had a great reformation here this winter.  Prest.  Young has given a great deal of instruction, which has been  of great service to the Twelve, and all the people.  The  Tabernacle has been crow[d]ed to excess this winter, and hundreds  could not get in.  Prest Young has not been able to  attend at the Tabernacle since the burial of J. M. Grant,  until Sunday 1st inst, when he spoke about one hour  and a half, to the great joy of the people.  Bro Kimball  has preached for several Sabbaths past with great plainness.  F. D. Richards and myself were the only ones of the Twelve  here in the city fall, and we organized the Missionaries  and went through the city in every ward preaching the reformation  We attended a meeting almost every night for 3 months.  Elders  O. Hyde and L. Snow have been with us during the sitting  of the Legislature. O. Hyde has gone South.  We  have  had a glorious winter, the spirit and power of God and  the Apostleship has rested upon us in power, and the vision of  our minds has been opened to see the state and position  of this people, and we have felt like rising up and  magnifying our callings.  The School Houses have been crowded to  excess, and there has been a great deal of good teaching given to the people  this winter.  The people are confessing and forsaking their sins, and being  baptized for the remission of them.  Your families are well so far as I know    Yours truly  W. Woodruff

 G. S. L. City ^Provo^ June 25 1858    Brother Cannon    I forward to you my history, I  wish my chap. of accidents to be put in one paper, which will  form the concluding chap. of my history; bro. Geo. A. & I have thought  it would be best not to divide that chap.; I wish my History to be  put in as few papers as you can conveniently. Please strike me off  six extra copies of the papers, and send them to me weekly at  Provo. Although there are many alterations I presume the copy  is intelligible. I did not think it best to have it re-copied,  but will trust to your a little ^care & attention^  in punctuation &c. Your papers  containing our history have been very correctly printed. My love to  your colleagues.    W. Woodruff 
 to him or be opened by Mr. Gerrish or somebody else which they have not  a legal right to do, so the thing is in a fix. Mr. Bell gave up the  office of post master, and so it has remained in Judge Smith's hands  where it ought to be. Our Legislature closed on the 16th, Jan. we have  had the best Session ever held in this Territory, done up all the business  right, and were of one heart and one mind, and do not think that  we have committed treason in only one thing, and that was in passing  an act that the whole Legislature should repent of their sins, and be  baptized for the remission of them, and adjourned for half a day and repaired  to the font and were all baptized and confirmed and I believe every one  received the Holy Ghost, this might be construed into treason as the Lord  the Holy Ghost, baptism and repentance are all very unpopular throughout  the world in a Legislative capacity, yet I do not think that it  could legally be made out to be treason either by the constitution or  laws of the United States, organic act, or laws of this country, yet  Congress may disannul the act, all except the receiving of the Holy Ghost  that the members have received and it cannot be taken from them if  they do their duty.    As touching the Historian office, I will say that we have not  done much during the sitting of the Legislature, but we are at it again,  on the 30th. the Presidency sat and heard the history read up to the  organization of the church in Nauvoo, 8th day of August 1844; also  President Young's life up to the same date. we have wrote a short sketch  of the life of each of his brothers, also bro. Kimball and are picking  up the life of the Twelve to follow in that stage of the history  bringing them all up to the same date 8th Augt. 1844.    The Reformation is still continuing in this city and Territory  with great interest. President Young has given much valuable teaching to  the Twelve and others during this winter, the Spirit and power of God

 your Letters contained a good Deal of matters upon various  subjects. Sister Smith has been to Utah for a week she  has just Returned & well the Calafornia Mail arived on the  24th brought some letters & papers some letters from C. C.

So have we more  Rain since you left than I have ever seen here in one  Spring. Crops of all kinds look well it is now begining to be  warm & Dry. We are told that the Indians war is vary  fierce in N.W Oregon that the Indians have possession of all the   country West of the Cascades, & that both white & Red man  have hard fighting Col Steptoe iswith his command is the  midst of it, and they have been [looked] to By [gracier] It is also said that Gen Harney is ordered to  Origon with his command, if they go through this Territory they will  find Hard pushing for supplies amid a people who are living upon  nettles, thistles, pigweeds with occasionally a little bread or meat  I think we will have considerable fruit this season  some 20 twenty of my Appletrees are bearing for the first time this  year I shall have a midling crop of peaches, plums full,  Quinces Bloomed, grapes are setting for fruit strbawberries are  ripe in my garden. President Young sent down 6 waggons to  Cedar City for wheat, tells of sending 14 waggons to Salmon River  for dryed salmon, but few fish caught in the Jordon yet.

 [This page the reverse of previous page] 
 Hon. J. M. Bernhisel G. S. L. city Feby. 2 1857.    Dear Sir,    We have not received an Eastern mail for some  three months, we sent out the Jan. mail for the East, they got to the top  of the first mountain and found much snow, and one of the company froze to  death (not a mormon) and the company returned, we have received the California  mail regularly up to this time, but the last mail had to come through  much snow. we are not looking for another Southern mail daily, we have  never seen as much snow in these mountains and vallies in any season since  we have been here, over eight feet has fallen in theis city, and the mountains  are full, the snow has been for weeks between 2 & 3 feet deep in this city,  about 3 feet on the Island, all the stock has been brought from there and  taken south and fed at home and some sent to Rush valley where the stock  have done well, there has been but little stock lost this season. business  is very dull this season not much money in circulation, most all goods  that are sold among the merchants have to be sold for stock or grain.  I have not taken either, and have sold but few goods, your family  are all well and doing well as far as I know, It is a general time of  health, we adjourned the Legislature to this city as you have heard, we  have had the best season we have ever had in this Territory.    Our reformation has continued with great interest throughout this  city and Territory, the Twelve have been at the head of the Missionaries  and I have attended some meeting about every night for the last 3 months,  F. D. Richards & myself have been the only ones of the Twelve here, except  O. Hyde & L. Snow who have been with us during the Legislature. O. Hyde  has gone South, & L. Snow to Box Elder. I forwarded to you last Fall  a letter to assist me getting some grafts from Wm. R. Prince & Coy.  Flushing New York. I never heard from you whether you received it or 
 last Sunday night in council from Lyman Wight to Father Porter, trying  to establish that the true church is with him upon the common stock  principle.    P. P. Pratt has just returned from a Mission south as far as Washington  County; all well south.    The eastern mail ^arrived^ on the 28th inst; it brought but few letters, and  the Letter mail bags which were missing of last mail are not heard from,   and probably never will be. I received a letter from you, and in  reply would say I have paid Miss Burbage all demands up to this date.  She is now married to John V. Long the Reporter, but still keeps schools.    I will keep you advised of all matters pertaining to the Mill as far  as I get them. Bror. Houtz has made some drafts on you, but he is still  owing you as you will see from the Bill I sent you by the 1st June mail.    Mrs. Pratt put into my hands a letter from Dr. Asa Fitch directed to   O. Pratt by your introduction. He wishes some one to send him some  grasshoppers and other insects from this Territory; they are very scarce this  season, but I think by diligent search we ^can^ find enough to supply his demand.    I remain Dear Sir  With great respect  Your friend  Wilford Woodruff  by Thomas Bullock. Clerk. 
 is like a fair ^their lay so many people & waggons on the shore^ catching & drying fish so that few has  as yet gone up the provo. Broth Maughn of E T City has  found a Led Lead on the Ridge between our city & Toella vally   they brought many sample to the president, supposed to contain 60 per  cent of pure lead. we have a splendid sample of 3 1/2 lb it is said to ^it contains^  90 per cent pure led ^Lead^ this was brought, 50 miles south of Los Vagus  brought ^sent^ By John Steel, their is a mountain of it. N. V. Jones has started  to examine it & to commence smithing it. Elder McCarthy who was shipwrecked  on one of the Society Island has baptized the Interpeter to the King who  He speaks 12 Languages, also the Interpeter to the Government company  He speaks 5 Languages. He ordained them both Elders & started the  Gospel in the midst of the people, so it was not in vain without  some good that He was shipwrecked. I wish our Deligates to  Washington could pull some wire that would work a charge  in the Mail operations for Utah for after waiting from  October to the 10th of May for a Mail, 24 bags of mail  matters near one half Due is still back to fill up and  Holes, or for some other purpose. Broth Bullock says that the U.S.  has been Delivered of half a mail & being 5 month old looks for the  other half to be born out of Due time but when we cannot tell  Mr McGraw has had an increase of 17000 Dollars to Reimburse him  for his hard labour & has his contract increased to 35000 to  indorse him to be Delivered twice a year as we suppose The clerk  of General Store has Reported that that the carrier informed him that  his orders were from McGraw that when He started with the Salt  Lake mail & came to any streams that was high not to attempt to  cross it but to Return to Salt Lake untill the waters was down 
 has rested upon him and his spirit has been more church than ever,  and his heart made more glad than ever before, in seeing the Saints  arise to a sense of their duties. The people throughout the Territory  are arising en masse to their duty, in confessing and repenting of their  sins, the Tabernacle is filled to overflowing through these winter months  and hundreds have to leave each Sunday that cannot get in, Elder  Kimball has preached the last few Sundays in the greatest plainness  without any regard to false traditions of the people, the power of  God has rested upon him. The Twelve have gone forth through  this city under the direction of Prest. Young and stood at the  head of the missionary operation, and attended all the Quorum  meetings of the Seventies, High Priests, Bishops & Ward meetings,  and the power of God has rested upon us, as never before, & the people  begin to realize in a measure that there are apostles in their midst.  I have attended a meeting of some kind almost every evening for the  past three months, and I have never felt as much of the Spirit  of God as during this Winter. I labored with J. M. Grant until  he died, I then labored in company with F. D. Richards, after he  came home & finally O. Hyde & L. Snow both arrived in this city and  they labored with us a short time. Elder Snow has gone up to Box  Elder, and O. Hyde has gone South to hold meetings, and get something  to help himself with. All our ward school houses are filled to overflowing  during the worst weather and even could you now attend a meeting in  Provo, you would be astonished to see hundreds of people striving to get  a seat in their places of worship, and should a notice be given out that  Geo. A. Smith would preach in that place, instead of seeing the coldness  that was formerly manifest almost the entire people would flock out to  hear. We are weighing up all the people in the Territory, with a  catechism containing a part of the law of God, and we are weighing

 Historian's office  G. S. L.

We hope, trust and pray with a good deal of faith  that you in connexion with our two honorable delegates sent by  the convention will make a three fold cord that cannot be broken  in Washington, but that it will be found strong enough when hitched  on to Utah Territory to draw it into the State of Deseret. We shall  look forward with feelings of the deepest interest to learn the result  which will emanate from the labors of that most important and  interesting Tribune which ever met in the councils of our Nation  to plead for the rights of a State or Territory since the foundation  of our great Republic. We know God will be with you in your  united efforts. He will guide you in your destiny, as delegates  and representatives of Deseret, as he did our Fathers of the first  Congress. God had his work to perform then—he accomplished it.  He has decreed a greater work now, that work he will perfect.  He will carefully guard it and his servants too, and I feel to say  to one and all of our worthy delegates let your hearts be comforted  all will be just right, do your best and trust it in the hands  of God, you all have the daily prayers of the righteous, if  there are any on the earth.

 Great Salt Lake City U. T. March 323rd 1856    Elder Taylor    Dear Sir    I have received a mission to  the States this spring the object of which is to get a font  of type east in the letter of the Deseret Alphabet & then to get  some school books printed in the same. President Young wishes  me to get this work accomplished so that some of the Books  can be brought to this city next fall. I hardly think it  can be accomplished in time to get Books through this season  but I do not know. I will start out with the missionaries  that go east this spring but I do not think that we can get any before  the first of May the mountains are so full of snow we cannot  travel. I wish you would do me the favor to make Enquiry  whare you think we can get this job done to the best advantage  ie to get the type made, the printing will of course be an after consideration    I have thought we could get the type cast in Cincinnati or  New York as well as any place. when it comes to printing we ought  to have one or two of the Bretheren engaged in it who are printers that  would be interested in it as it will be in a New Letter & will require  considerable time & attention in the type setting & proof Reading &c    After getting what information you can upon these matters from  the type fonderies in New York Cincinnati &c you will do me a  favor by forwarding a letter to me Directed at Cin St Louis Mo 
 Historian's Office   Great Salt Lake City, May 29th 1856    Hon. John Taylor,    I presume you will not have any objection to receiving a  monthly letter from me now I have entered upon my duties as Historian  and therefore commence by saying I am just recovered from a four weeks'  sickness caused by the poisonous virus inoculating my arm when skinning  an ox which had died very suddenly; it came very near carrying me into  another state of existence, but by kind attention, frequent administrations, and  the continued prayers of the saints my life is spared to continue my labors on  this earth.    On the 10th of this month our eyes were astonished to see a U. S. mail  come into the valley from the east loaded with about one half of the  letters and papers that had left Independence since last October; the  remainder, Mr. McGaw (the contractor) or his agent had very considerately  cached by the way, or perhaps left at Fort Laramie for worn out, tired  out soldiers to read through the long winter nights, when tired of talking about  their victory over a few semi savages, and half starved ignorant remnants  of Indian tribes, and they would also naturally be anxious to read the  correspondence of a people who believe in Polygamy.    Although I write you under this date it is impossible to prophesy when you  will receive it, as I learn from a reliable source that Mr. McGaw told his  agent that when he came with the mail from Salt Lake if he came to  any stream that was deep not to attempt to cross it, but return to Salt Lake  again, and stay until the waters are down, for it would be all right, as  the government had reimbursed Mr. McGaw $17,000 this trip, and  $35,000 for last contract. I do not vouch for this, but give it you as  I received it, and it is casually believed here. When the Mormon  Boys, Decker, Young, Hanks, Little &c. carried the mail to Laramie

 as He would get his pay just the same as though the mail went.  Last Friday they adressed things to 20 persons from Dry creek &   20 from American Fork, & yesterday to 20 from Plesant Grove &   201 from Provo Next friday 40 will come from Springville.    So you will see the fruits of your presidency are Reciving an increas   of Blessings. Brother Bullock is vary weak & feeble at present, either   from a change to hot weather or a push of Blood to the Head Brothers Grushing  Hawkins & Campbell are well & busy, & all wish to be Reunited   to you. We all are living in great faith that you will   not forget us but Remember the Historians office & write   us each Mail & give us all the News with usyou & you will   much oblige us all    Yours Truly   W. Woodruff    I was bothe told that on Monday that the president intended to  push the Historian's office was to get us into it as soon as possible   We received by the last Mail a vary polite interesting Letter from the   chief Director of her Majestys Royal Garden kew. Directed to the Secretary   of the Horticulteral Society of Deseret. He had a Deseret News sent him [casting]   our organization of that society last season He writes to open a correspondence    with us, & obtain any specims, seeds, ^or^ plants of any trees, shrub, grain, flour or   vegitable the production of our mountain Home, & He vary kindly preffers to   forward to us any thing we will order from their Royal Gardens. I count this   a valuable opening for Utah for I Believe the Royal Gardens kew   contains as great & good a collection of fruits, grapes, flour, & leeks as   can be found in the world & I think it worth our attention    [sideways text]  29 May 1856  W.

 not. I wish you to help me in another thing if you can by  any means to send me $5.00 worth of the tubers of the Chinese  Potatoe, from Mr. Prince as we wish to get it in this Territory,  and try it for if one quarter is true that Mr. Prince publishes  about it, it will be of great benefit to this Territory. I would  also like to obtain some Indigo and Madder seed to try here,  we are also desirous of obtaining some of Hoveys seedling strawberries,  if we can by any means or the Lawton blackberry, but the chinese  Potatoe we are very anxious to obtain, and if you or any friend will  forward to Mr. Prince $5.00 and order that amount of the tubers of  that plant directed to W. Woodruff G. S. L. City U. T. I will pay the  money to your order.    We are now having a great thaw and our Streets are  filling with snow broth, the Earth will be well soaked. There is  a vast amount of snow in the mountains.    Please drop me a line via California if we can't get anything  by the Eastern mail. I would like to hear from you.    yours truly  W. Woodruff

 Great Salt Lake City April 9th 1856    Elder J. Taylor    Dear Sir    I wrote two Letters  to you by the last Mail one via Calafornia & the other via  of the Eastern Mail. I wrote you upon the subject of ny  going East to get a font of type made in the Deserett Alphabet  & some Books printed in that letter. Since I wrote we have  passed through some changes during our interesting General  Conference, & among other things my mission is changed I  was appointed by the conferene to assist in the Historians office  So I remain at Home, & the intentions now is to have  Brother Erastus Snow to get the type made & forward it  to this place & paper & binding materials & forward it  to this place so we will do our printing here. Brother  Snow will manage this matter on his arrval to St Louis  You will learn by this Mail that yourself with  Elder G A. Smith are appointed by the conventioin  as the Delegates to washington to present the Constit-  ution of the State of Deseret & to ask for a State  Goverment We hope you may be sucessful. We have  just closed our General Conference we have had an interesting  time some 250 or 300 Mormon's were appointed to various  parts of the Vineyard. the Spirit of the Lord was with the 
 And any information you can give me upon this subject that   will facilitate the work will be Kindly Received, we have got out  two primmers one a pictorial primmer & a first Reader & wish   to get manuscrip Ready for 2-3 & 4th Readers if we can but as is  generally the cast case their is so many matters on hand that we  may not have time to accomplish all that we wish in this thing  I think you have been ^some^ acquainted with the Deseret Alphabet  there has been some changes from the origional, the following is   our present Letter which we expect to get cast    {{Deseret}} 
 up all the Quorums of the Church, especially the Seventies and  dropping the members who have stood for years as a dead letter  upon the books, but have not reported themselves to their Presidents,  the Spirit and power of God has been like fire shut up in our  bones this winter, and the vision of our minds has been open  in a measure to the importance of magnifying our calling in the  Priesthood, and building up the kingdom of our God. We are thinking  of taking a tour North as far as Salmon river Settlement &c.,  in the Spring instead of going South as we have done in former  seasons. We are now having a great thaw, and the streets are filled  with Snow broth, and some places are getting bare and the stock will  soon live, but few of the stock have died this winter in comparison  with what we lost last Season. It is a general time of health this  winter but comparison with what very few deaths. Your family are all  well and the families of all the brethren with you in the States.  There is one thing I wish you to do for me and for the benefit  of the people in this Territory. we have received the Pamphlets con-  taining the account of the Diascorea batatas or new chinese Potatoe as  [1 1/6] now growing in the garden of Wm. R. Prince & Coy. [company] Flushing N. Yr  if one fourth is true that is told of that vegetable it will be of  great benefit to us in this Territory, I wish you to see that $5  worth of the Tubers either through J. M. Bernhisel, J. Taylor, or  yourself or through any body else that you can do the business  through & I will pay your family in the money or anybody that  you will direct, the tubers can be packed in a tin case and directed  to W. Woodruff G. S. L. City, U. T. as we are anxious to try them.  we also want to get a few roots of the Hovey Seedling Strawberries, &  Lawton's blackberry from Prince's Gardens, if we can any way.

 many persons are nearly ruined. The Church had last October over  2600 head in Weber and Cache Counties; now they can count nearly  500; Gilbert & Gerrish had 700 head when they started from the Missouri  river, now they have 95. Messer. Kerr lost their entire herd, valued  at $60,000, and all the citizens in proportion. Hundreds of persons  have lived on dead cattle when the could be got at for snow, and now  it has disappeared they are living on weeds, roots, and greens.    Although we have had the grasshopper plague, and the excessive drouth  of last summer, and the unparalelled severe winter, now they have  disappeared, every face is beaming with gladness, because the hand  of the Lord has been seen in his mercifully sending the rains once a  week this Spring, which causes the wheat to rise from the ground as a   harbinger of "the good time coming boys;" many are anxiously expecting  to cut wheat by the 20th June, and then we'll have a jubilee.    The Potatos, Corn, Squash, Peas, and other vegetables look well, and  we expect to reap a bountiful harvest to feed those who are here, and  those who are wheeling the barrows over the plains; so be of good cheer,  all is well in Zion.    I am happy to learn that your agents have obtained subscribers  for 780 out of the 800 copies of the Mormon sent here; it is a truly valuable  paper, and merits an extensive circulation. It is highly approved here,  and if the people could be assured of the mail bringing what is sent at  Utah, you would have a more extended patronage. We wish you to  preserve a good file for the Historian's Office, and bring it with you, or send  by some trusty elder when he emigrates to the valley of peace, having  previously got it well bound.    Yours truly,  W. Woodruff 
 The past year has been a severe time with the people  in this Territory the crops being nearly all cut all last sumer by  the grasshoppers and the winter has been so cold that I would  judge that 3/4 of all the stock in the whole Territory are Dead, & nearly  all the Sheep, almost every thing in the Northern part of the Territory is dead,  but vary few of the people in the Territory have bread to eat, & their does not  appear to be animals Enogh left in the Territory to plough the  ground. snow is still lying on the ground North of Davis County 18 inchs  deep. we had a few heards of cattle & sheep in ceder valley & on south alive  & the Indians came & stole them & drove them onto the Desert &  killed some 8 or 9 men a few of the cattle were retaken but it  is said they have drove away some 200 & 300 Head of cattle & Horses  we have been informed that their was but few Indians ingaged  in it, most of ^the Indians^ them are friendly but they as well as the whites  have to dig Roots this spring in order to live. We have not Received any  Eastern Mail since last fall yet the Mormon has visited us via Calafornia  and it is truly a welcome visiter. You will learn of the Different  missions by the News of Deseret if you get it I will forway  forward a copy of this via Calafornie & on the eastern Route Hopeing you  may get one of them your family are all well as far as I know  Sister Taylor called upon us a few days since & was well    Truly Yours    W. Woodruff

 Brother Orson I not {shorthand} trouble you to prove a few lines from my ^own^ pen   And if you can get along with it as well as Broth John Taylor did with one bro G. A. Smith   you will do well for He presented the Letter to 3 men an English French & Jerman soldiers in order  to try to find out what Language it was written in & ther was not a man in New York that could  tel what it was they could not guess out but 3 words in the Letter & they wrote back & asked   him if they had guessed right the final Decison was that it was cause trusts enough of the  new to the subject.    what I shall now say to you I do upon the principles of doing unto you   as I would wish to be done by. And that in concerning your family affairs that part of your   family that live in the 19 ward have been Entering complaints against your first wife   & in a measure against you for not providing better for them. the Bishop of   the ward took up the subject & I then furnished them with some promis  they who applyed to the tithing office & drew from there ^some [of] the^ Men promis  while they were drawing at the same time from Mrs pratt they finally Entered   complaint to the president giving him a Bill of what they had received (as they say)  & also saying that sister pratt Had received $600 from Liverpool & would not provid  for them &c the consequence was that Elder Hyde in conexion with F D Richards &   myself was called upon to call the family together & investigate the matter Elder Hyde   & myself Attended F. D. Richards did not but I told them both my feelings upon the   subject. I was somewhat accqainted with sister pratts cause in the matter. Brother   Hyde has Had one side of the question I the other I told him He would find two sides  to it, when we met we did. I think all the family from the 19 ward manfested a bad   spirit & badly misrepresented things. It was then clearly shown that there was not   but a small portion of the provisons & things in the Bill which they received & it was   also shown that it was not true that sister pratt had received $600 from Liverpool  but it questioned the $400 ofCredit of Hooper store & that mostly went to pay Debts  formerly contracted, and I Belive Brother Hyde was satisfied that they had a bad spirit   & misrepresented sister pratt. we both gave them good council I told them they should   act for your interest & maintain your honour while you was gone. I told them   if they did not unite with sister pratt & try to get along wiell they would not prosper   but would bring trouble upon themselves. I felt & do believe that sister pratt is doing   all she can to make them comfortable and I do not think that there was any occasion  to make the complaints they have. I think they had a Bad spirit & did not act for   your interest as they should have Done in your Absence I went to Brother Hill in   the tithing office & told him How things were & He Refused to let them have   any more flour because they were Drawing their weekly rations for four  since they found we were investigating the matter closely (inasmuch as they had laid  it upon us) they have ben still & I have heard Nothing from them for a month I  understand that Marion & perhaps another one is going South perhaps to Filmore 
 Mrs. Mary ann Young who has been very sick but is recovering.  S. W. Richards' first wife is quite low. It is a general time  of health we are now beginning to have very hot and dry  weather though we have had more rains than we have known  any spring before wheat, grass, corn and potatoes are growing very  fast it is thought that some will begin to cut wheat by the  20th of June. Our gardens are looking fine some 20 of my  appletrees are bearing for the first time, my quinces are in bloom  peaches a middling crop, plums very full, strawberries bearing well  and some of them ripe a week ago, all kinds of vegetables  look well.    Your family are well.  We would be pleased to hear from you at any  time.    yours truly—  W. Woodruff 
 we got the bags, but they have not got their pay for it. Oh consistency!  has thou entirely fled from the United States? if so, when wilt thou return?  The difficulties of crossing the rivers are really awful, for a very respectable  lady over 70 years of age has started with oxen to go the Missouri river,  and I think Mr. McGaw is sadly to blame in not engaging her to carry  the mail, and then pay her for the odd trip. Brother Taylor, can you  inform me how it is that your letters via South Pass, and your Duplicates  by way of California, all come in the same letter bag? Your letters  are not the only ones that so strangely come together.    Your letter to Bishop Hunter was read in the council last Sunday;  all were glad to hear from you, and suppose 'ere this you have learned  your destiny—that you have to stay at Washington a little longer; we  all pray that you and your colleagues may be prospered in your exertions  on behalf of the fair vales of Deseret, and that you may win laurels for  yourself and co-workers with you.    I am happy to inform you that all your family are well; Sister Taylor  visited me the other day in good health and spirits.    The Presidency and Twelve are well—also their families, with the exception  of Sister Mary Ann Young who is now prostrated through her continued  exertions in administering to the necessities of so many who were destitute  this past season; she is a little easier to day.    We learn by Madam Rumor that General Harney has been ordered  by the Government to march his troops to the scene of the Indian Wars  in Oregon, and that he expects to replenish his supplies when passing  through the Northern part of this Territory; if this is true he is bound  to be disappointed, for the severe winter has killed four out of every  five head of cattle in the Northern Counties; the desolation is deplorable, 
 respects to Hon. J. M. Bernhisel & J Taylor and any friends connected  with you.    yours truly  W. Woodruff    P. S. On Sunday 1st inst. Prests. Young, Kimball & Wells all appeared in  the Tabernacle, before a house filled to overflowing, it was the first time  that President Young has appeared in the Tabernacle since the burial of  J. M. Grant on the 4th December, & it created a deep sensation among the  people. He spoke one hour and a half and he gave much valuable instruction  and teaching & was followed by H. C. Kimball & D. H. Wells, all of which  will appear in the News.    Sister Bathsheba Smith called upon my family yesterday. she was smart  and well.  W. W    Feb. 4 2 p.m. The Cala. mail has just arrived.

 G. S. L City 3 July 1856    Ed of Western Standard    I continue my monthly correspondence  for your paper.    The Weather has been dry and warm since I last  wrote to you. we have had 2 slight showers during the past  month. Barley harvesting commenced last monday the 23rd and  some wheat in the big field was cut on Saturday last. Much  of the crops however have suffered materially for the lack of water;  by good management and much physical labor the waters of the   Big Cotton wood have been brought Northward as far as Kanyon  creak by way of the canal, and have been used on the  10 and 5 acre lots, which will help some fields of grain  that would have been almost an entire failure; br J. Wright  reports the wheat crops for 3 miles around Fort Brigham completely  eat up by Grasshoppers. The tobacco worm in great  numbers are eating up the Potatoe vines, but we manage  to kill them, for they soon grow so large they are easily  seen. Many fields of wheat look well and the city Gardens  promise much, but city kanyon creek is very low.    The arrangements of the committee for the national  celebration of the 4th of July, have been made on a large scale.  We will have a grand military Review and the Legion are  making preparations accordingly. A copy of the programme has  been forwarded to you by the post office.    Prests. Young and Kimball have just returned from  spending 3 days on the island examining their stock. 
 Great Salt Lake City July 3rd 1857  Editor of Standard    Dear Sir    The Calafornia Mail arrived on  1st inst July  & as usual brought in the Standard which  we found stored with good things. The eastern Mail from   the US and on the 23rd ints in charge of Br Ephriam K Han  Hanks 23 Days from Independence the shortest trip on Record  bringing a large Mail. we Received the mormon up to May 9th  & we find the Edition of that valuable papier as well in the Edition  of the Standard on magngifying ther calling as a Champion  of Rights. Brothe Ferywoodmore Little Sister came with the mail with   Brother Hanks they were Accompanied by Siste Sayers & Sister Vose  of Boston ^Sister Vose^ she was is 77 years of Age & Rode some 12000 mils in  23 days & stood her Journey well. We can still say all   is peace, Harmony, qui^e^tude, & plenty throughout Utah & we as  a people have Never seen such prospect for a mamouth  harvest as this seasn Our wheat fields were ner as good   yesterday we had Rains it soaked the ground thoroughly  all kinds of vegetation looks well. Garden Orchards & fields  are beautiful to look upon. On the ^3rd^ June a few Brothers  Arrived from San Burnadeno ^Elder^ Amasa lymna and with the  Calafornia Mail & Elder Rich and on the 8th both in  good Health & spirits we have Enjoyed a good Deal of   ther society since they arrived in our midsts & we are all glad  to see them.

 T. D. Brown has been appointed to superintend the  making of a canal for bringing the waters of Weber river  to the Hot Springs 4 miles north of this city, the operations  to commence immediately    We hear of a very large emigration for the mines  and it is reported that 25,000 head of stock are on the way  by the Northern route.    I am happy to be able to inform you that the  choice fruit which you sent to your friends in this Territory  have been grafted and most of them have lived and are growing  finely; also some choice Fruit mostly apples were obtained  from the East which are alive and doing well. We  consider this a great blessing to our thriving Territory.  It is a general time of health, but great scarcity of  bread, but we look forward for the coming harvest to re-  lieve the wants of the people.    The Presidency and Twelve with their families are  all well.    yours truly,  W. Woodruff    [P]S. Bro: Cannon I have a fine orchard of 50 seedling  apple trees growing, about one half of them begin to bear  fruit for the first time this season. I want to graft or bud  my orchard with better fruit, and I have not yet been en  enabled to obtain any States fruit; you will do me a great  favor if you will put me up a package soldered in a tin case 
 Great Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, May 29th 1856    Hon. Sir,    The only mail from the east by way of the South Pass since last October arrived  here on the 10th. inst, and brought us your favor of the 14th Feby last, which in take the earliest  opportunity of answering. We shall take great pleasure in laying your esteemed communication  before the Society at our next meeting, and in making such arrangements as will ensure as  far as possible the fulfilling of your requests. We have a great variety of cactuses, some  of which bear beautifully scented flowers of scarlet, purple, yellow, and white; the cones  vary in size from an apple to over 60 inches in circumference, and  bear a fruit which much  resembles the flavor of the mellow gooseberry. We have also in the southern portion of our ter-  ritory several varieties of the Agave or Soap Plant.    The almost inaccessible mountains are covered with many varieties of Pines, Balsams,  Firs &c; among others we have the Pinyon Pine, which exudes a gum universally used by the  natives, and now by many whites, for its healing properties. The Pinyon Pine is a dwarf tree,  its foliage measured through horizontally generally exceeding in diameter the height of the  tree; in its early growth it takes the shape of a haycock, and eventually that of an expanded  umbrella; it seldom exceeds 20 feet in height, and the berry or nut being nutritious is gathered  by the natives for sustenance, the last resembling that of the filbert. We have also the Red  and white Cedar in immense quantities. Our Mountain Maple differs from all the varieties  with which we are acquainted; it is a very hard grained wood, and seldom exceeds a foot  in diameter. But the greatest curiosity of its kind is the Deseret Mountain Mahogany; it  is the heaviest, hardest, and finest of any wood we have seen, being very close grained, and  capable of a very fine polish; the colors are intermixed throughout from a dark brown to  nearly white; it is a scarce tree, being found in but few localities. The Box Elder is a  beautifully grained wood, much resembling the Bird's eye Maple, and is used for secretaries,  Tables &c; this tree is found more or less throughout the Territory, but in the greatest quantity  about 70 miles north of this city, giving the name to Box Elder County. Although we are  writing on "Royal Oak day", we cannot boast much of our oaks in this territory; there are  but few, and then mostly of a scrabby stunted growth.

 of choice apple cuttings, or any good fruit, so I can graft  next Spring and send me the names of the varieties and  their numbers, and if some thrifty cuttings would retain their  buds live to be set this season so I could bud from them  I would be glad, but I do not know whether buds would  live or not after a voyage by mail; but we know the  grafts would in the Spring, but for grafting they will want  to be cut in December or January I suppose or sometime  in the winter. I feel anxious to get some fruit from the  States and those that are now growing in this city will  not do to bud from this Season.  W.W

 We find in our cañons, or ravines, in great abundance, a shrub, the fruit of which from its  usefulness to us when we had no cultivated fruit, we call the Service berry; this fruit is  about the size of the black currant, but not quite so juicy, though of much richer flavor,  and very nutricious; it forms a considerable portion of the food of the natives during  the autumnal and winter months. The white settlers form pleasure parties, and go into the  cañons to spend a few days during the season in gathering service berries, which they  dry and lay up for winter use. If properly dried the fruit preserves its qualities throughout  the year. We have also two varieties of a very prickly shrub, bearing a small acid berry,  some red and some yellow; this we call the Buffalo berry, and it makes a good wine.  The shrub grows to the height of about 8 feet.    You may not be aware that the 22nd of July 1847 was the first day that the van of the  pioneers of civilization entered these valleys, about 130 in number, and among whom were your  correspondents; that on the 23rd the first plow was put into the ground to tear up the virgin soil;  and therefore you will have to make allowances for our imperfect knowledge of all the varieties  of flowers, fruits, and shrubs. On account of the scarcity of food in 1848, the people made  use of a root called the Sego, or "Calochortus Lateus"; this is a bulbous root from the size of  a pea to that of the walnut, and grows in immense quantities; the flower much resembles  a delicate tulip. There is another description of the Sego which is a deadly poison.    There is also an abundance of the Phaca Mollissima in this territory—a very  neat flower; and many pretty flowers and grasses peculiar to this mountainous country, the  scientific names of which we are unable to give at this time. We shall feel gratified in  sending you the various specimens, and feel under many obligations for your kind offer  to name many of them, and to form a floral list for Deseret; and we are aware  from the delightful opportunities you have in the Royal Gardens, that you can confer  on us many lasting favors, which will be appreciated not only by us a people but  by our posterity. We deem that it may not be uninteresting to you to know that we  have very choice varieties of wheat, viz, Taos, Club, and Scoca headed, which are 
 storm considers it the worst trouble he has & wonders why the man  in the House is not troubled about it, wy bless your Soul I  never saw a year since the organization of the Church when the people  were as Happy & peacible peaceible, as well united, & contented as   little ^trouble^ of any kind or  had as much confidence in the Leaders  of the Church as this present season And it was really ^amusing^ finely  to the Untanians when the Eastern Mail came in to see the  perfet flood of falshood lies, trash, folly fro^a^th & nonsense   & the trouble that it gave the whole United States to take care  of this little Handful of Mormons that were shut up here  in their clusters of the rocks who were peaceably attending  to ther own busenes, & how & could not see how we   could trouble any one And inasmuch as the people in general  in this City could not have an opportunity of Reading very externally  what the word &c say about us President Young appointed   One ^day^ sabbath on purpose for the people to come togeth & learn  what is written about us some 9 or 10 thousnd amitted & 2 afar  bet Readers were Eruping from 8 till 12 oclk in Reading some  of the most rapid peaces [[illegible Governor Young & the mormons  in Utah. It was indeed Novel forward to hear the  Govrner prepare such  Articles to be Read seeing that they  were mostly aimed at his private ^& pertler^ Character but this ownly   shows the consciousness he possesses of the Rectitude of the paths  which He persues & the confidence he has in the people whom   He leads, & there is not a child 10 years old in this city  but what knows that what was prnted & Read against us, was  a Buch of lies that dogs Ready told us more news aout  ourselves as a people & our Governer in perticular than we   ever expet to see fulfilled in our day & Generaton. The noble  citizens of Utah are quit amused at the Idea of our   Governor Runng away to save his life from the Saints  in Utah, when all the people here well know that  9 out of 10 of all the inhabitants of Utah both male  & fefmale would lay Down ther lives to save his or of serving  to Defend him any day or hour against the Rage & malace of   wicked & ungodly men. The people of Utah know Brigham  Young to well to forsake him he has more true friends ^today^ that   would die for him if necessary than any other man living upon 
 2nd page to Ozem Woodruff    And considering that you are alone in this work that there is no Saints  with you it is wonderful to me that you can keep the faith at all   when ther is so much Darkness to oppose you. I feel to pray the Lord   to Bless & Strengthen you, yes uncle Ozem maintain your faith   untill Death & God will give you a crown of life if the cau[s]e you are   enga[ge]d in is not of God ther is none on Earth that is of God I know it is of   God & it is a source of Great consolation to me to know that I have ^any^ of my  Ki[n]dred who will met me in the Celestial Kingdom of God, our work will   soon be closed here we shall meet the other side of the vail soon then   we shall get our reward for maint[ain]ing the faith & we shall be satisfied  with it. I feel like living my religion & Dying for it if necessary.   Life is of no value to me at the sacrifice of salvation & the favor of God   in the Eternal world. I know the cause that we are Engaged in if God   and all the world is opposed to us & would ann[i]hilate us if they had  power, the same Hatred malace & lies is manifest agst us that was   manifest agst the old proph[et]s & Jew & the Apostles. I hve a   great Desire to be faithful in my generation as th[e]y were in theirs  the Heathen rage & the people imagine vain things, but in the own    Due time of the Lord, He will leave them in Demise & Laugh at their   calamity. the signs of the times are big with Events. there is waiting me  misery & Death await the world. And No mistake about it, the signs   of the times show it very plain. As to the Legistators of Utah being all   [cripels/criminals] & near sighted & h[av]ing so many wives there is none of it true  no more than a thousand other things that is told about us. It is true that  men here do have more wives than one, & so did Abraham & the old  prophets the fathers of the faithful, in whose bosom the Christian world expect   to to rest & when they get there if they ever do they will find Abraham with   all his wives & children is the family organization of the celestial world ther  were was a reason why Abraham & the Ancient Saints & Apostles had more   than one wife that they might raise up a Holy seed unto God who should  bear the priesthood & build up the priesthood Kingdom & know God it is  so now the Lord has revealed this prinsiple & commanded his servants in   some instan[ces] to take more than one wife for there are many Noble spirits   in the presence of God who hve got to take tabernacles on Earth before the   coming of Christ it is the will of God that these spirits should take tabernacles   through the Holy priesthood instead of taking tabernacles through the wicked  where th[e]y would be taught & led to fight against God by their parents so that

When all things are taken into consideration, this city being only about 8  years old, and standing in a previously unknown, or rather untried climate,  and being upwards of 4,000 feet above the level of the sea, surrounded by  snow capped mountains, which tower 6,600 feet above the valley, and by arid,  sandy deserts, we consider we have made great advancement in the cul-  tivation of fruits, having raised nearly all from seeds.    Your generosity in kindly forwarding seeds or plants will be one of the  greatest blessings you can confer upon us as a people, tens of thousands of whom  were born on the British Isles, and retain a lively recollection of their native  land. The seeds of strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries & currants, cuttings of  grapes and roses, or any thing your judgment may dictate, would be highly  prized here; and we beg leave to assure you that whatever you may be pleased  to send to our address will be distributed in such a manner as that produce  the greatest good to the greatest number. Should you be so kind as to take the  trouble to have seeds and cuttings properly put up for us, we take the liberty of referring  you to Prof r. Orson Pratt, of 36 Islington, Liverpool; or to Col. James A. Little at  the same address; they will not only carefully see to the receipt and delivery  of such boxes and parcels as you may commit to their care, but will cheerfully  respond to any queries and suggestions you may wish to make them.    We have thus written our first letter to you, briefly touching a few subjects  in order that you may know our situation and wishes, and we shall promptly  reciprocate your favors from time to time, and forward such seeds and specimens  as you may wish as opportunity may present. We shall be grateful to you  for such suggestions and instructions as you may in your leisure moments  be pleased to give upon the subject of Horticulture and Botany.    We remain, Sir William,  With sentiments of high respect.  Your obedient servents  Wilford Woodlruff  President of the Deseret Horticultural Socy  Thomas Bullock,  Secretary    To  Sir William J.

As to Drummond his History in Utah  in some measure has already been told He leaves  his wife & children at home & starts for Utah as a United  States Judge to Judge the people & set them an Example for  Morals. But He having been informed by some former officials  that Utah was a hard place for Men of Leasure He picks him  up a Miss in due time before He leaves St. Louis & He   brings that Miss with him & keeps her with him in all his  as an assitent in all of his Official Labours in Utah & that  to under the Honorable title of Mrs Drummand. But when  Mrs Richards living near this City who is a sister of the   Real Mrs. Drummond called to pay her sister a visit  She beheld a woman which she had never before seen and  had to turn away in Disgust from one who may come  to regulate the mind of Utah. And after clearing up  trying to put the Capitol of the Territory under Marshall Law  & having men carried a hundred miles in Juries  & brought before  his honour for utering the treasonable opinions that Neither  the Constitution & nor laws of the United States Required  a United States Judge to have a Miss sit with him  upon the Judgement Seat in order to make his acts legal,  which cause he persued as many can testify & after going to   Calaforinia & publishing his charge to the Jury of law  fully which He ner Delivered to them. He then Returning  to the United States & writes his Resignation & tells  the awful tails Murder & crimes of which Governer  Young & the mormons were guilty, which has set all   the world in a foam but while Doing this He should  have waited a little Longer before He went so near his  Real wife as to cause her to go to pay him a visit &  while seaking an interview with him He hastens to her  her Home & steals some of the children & carried them off  before she Returned so the Michigan paper paper published  in his Neighborhood rep & off course they would not say anything  about him but what was true

 this is the man that writes to swallow up Utah  & build a gallows to Hang the Governr & all his true  friends upon But by way of conditions concerning him I would  ask ^how^ what will the Hon Judge disperse of his two Mrs Drummonds  Real living wives immorals as He is inspired with such Holy  Honor against the mormons for Having more than one wife  Or is that ^become^ admissible in the Christian world in this last  age of civilization & Refinement with all men inasmuch as they  are not mormons. We would like to be informed upon this poi[n]t  as we have been so long from the civilized world that we may be   ignorant upon some of the po[i]nts of improvement    This is one singular characteristic with all men who eithr go out  of Utah or go through it who are Enemies to this people & that  is they just barly escape with ther lives yes they do Really  escape with their lives & so many of them of ^them^ to, this is singular  whn we consider that the mormons are such a Desperate Blod  thirsty people as our Enemies would fain make world beleve  but would there characters report this & feel this way if they did  not really Believe that if Justice had ben done then  they never would have left utah with ther lives I think  not. But really has they not any body ben killed in  Utah. If there has not ^been^, I think the people are sadly to  blame for since the opening of the Gold milnes of Calafornia the  whole country from Calafornia to Oregon has been so rifled with  Murderers & Robers & thievs that the good Christian people of  Calafornia have found it necssary to shout & find there  scores & Hundreds without Judge or Jury acording to Law & no  one has called them in question for it as told the Govenor  resopnsible for it, & it would be strange if ther was not any  one in Utah that should get killed without Judge or Jury  but then I will acknowledge ther is a great Diffence for  the people in Utah are mostly mormon & they have a  mormon Governor & the Christins would of come [throh]  that a Mormon Governor be held Responsible for the  death of any man & evry crime committed in his territory  while any man would at once be comitted fo & that Justly to  ownly ben for the Insane Hospital who should make any such

 Demand or Require any such Responsibility of any Governor in any   state or territory. but this is an item of Difference between   Mormon & Antemormans. there is more crime committed in one  day in many Cities of the United States with the same ^amount^ [illegible]  of population than ther is in Utah in ^a^ years, but that   is performed by Chistains & also by Mormons that makes the   Differnce. If we are overtaken in a fault & do any thing wrong   in Utah we confess our sins & learn to forsake them   & thank our ^governor or any other fr[ien]d^ frends for telling us our faults, Realizes that   the Rebukes of a frend are better & far more profitabe than the   kisses of an Enemy, but in the chrstian world the people   labor Diligently to hide ther faults, & if the Governor   of Calafornia, New York, or Connecticut was to tell the   people ther faults & show them ther sins they would consider  himself ^themselves^ very fortunate ^to^ escape withot being puled down or having ther  throat cut. The Question is often asked what is going to be done  with Utah & what will the people of Utah do.  Now this Depends  entirely upon circustances The inhabitants of Utah know well   as a people that they have broaken No law either Human   or Divine the Laws & Constitution of the United States   garentee unto us all that we have Either Realized or asked for   & if the Goernment of the United States persues a lawful &   Legal cause towards us ther will never be any Difficulty   betwen Utah & the General Government. & it is certainly Hard  to believe that the Goverment will has arrived at that state of   Decline or Deacay that she would be willing to Risk the   Result & future consequences of steping out side of the   Constitution and opening a war of Pesecuton & extermation   against any state or territory because of ther Religious faith or  practice as long as that faith or practice does not come   in contak with the constitutn or Laws of the United States   for in that case they might begin to withhold the sympathies  from Utah & prepare to weep for thousads & the childen for should  they attempt to undermine the constition that Great & Glorious Legacy  Given by God throgh our Fathers unto the American people for the sake  of Gratifying the envy of the Rable for a little Mormon Blod

 ^If the object ^of our Enemies is in there preset objectives [apt to]^ is to destroy Mormonds from off the earth.^    I can inform all men that they have undertaken a  task which is not in the power of man to Accomplish   ^mormonism is the work of God & when men fight against it they fight god Here this covenant prevail^  for should they ^our Enemies^ ever Destroy the little handful of 800,000 riverliving rivers   in Utah that would not begin to stop the mormonism  for the Elders of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints   are scattered throghtout nearly the whole Earth & wherever the  Effort has been made to Destroy us it has added thousads   to the Church & all men will find this to be the case unto   the End. And all men will find, Even Emperors, Kings, Rulers,  Princes, presidets, Governors, Judges, Doctors, Lawyers, prints   & Editors & all Nations of men that ^The Rulers & people of the whole Earth will find^ before they have fully   destroyed Mormonism from off the Earth or killed half   of the mormons in Utah Territory, that they will have as   much as they can called to do to attend to ther own heads  & meet the coming storms which is nigh Even ^at^ their   own Doors and all men will find this to be true  And I wish to bear my testimony unto all men   unto all men unto whom these lines may come that the   ^for the^ God of Heaven has a controversy with this Generation & is   about to bring judgment upon the world because of that wickedness  of man. The Lord Raised up Joseph Smith to bring forth   his work He was a true prophet of God & both the Righteous &   wicked will find it so when they come to Judgment. He brought forth   the Book of Mormon which is a true Record.  The Lord Raised   him up to bring forth the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel unto this  Generation to save the honest & meek of the Earth & the leave  the wicked without excuse in the day of Gods Judgment, & prepare the   way for the Coming of the Son of man. He was a good & Elect man   & laid the foundation of a great work which Neither men nor Devils  can overthrow. He greatly Desired the Happiness & Salvation of all   good men He sealed his testimony with his Blood & will Receve  a Marters Crown. Brigham Young is his successor in office   He is the leader of the people the spirit & power of God & all the Rights  is upon him.

Woodruff,    Dear Brother,  Will you permit me to trespass  upon a little of your time by  asking a few questions upon  an important matter, to me  at least?    They are in relation to the  blessing of little children.    1st. Is it actually necessary  for the Saints to take their  Children to the fast meetings  to have them named and blessed?    2nd. Is it not the fathers right 
 and privilege to bless his own  offspring. and in case he does  not take them to fast meeting  to have them blessed again  will they be cut short of any  blessings in the great eternity  before us?    None of my children have  been blessed in fast meeting,  their grandfather (the late  Bp. E. D. Woolley,) blessed all  that were born prior to his  death, and those born since  I have blessed. I keep a  family record, and give the  branch clerk a copy of the Same.  I also babtize my children on  the day that they are eight years  old. Am I right on these   matters. Please answer if you  have time, and oblige    Your brother in the gospel,  Joshua R. Clark.
