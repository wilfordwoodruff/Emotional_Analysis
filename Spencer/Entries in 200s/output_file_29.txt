Dear Brother:  Your letter of the 25th inst. is at hand. In reply to the same I will say that I am willing to respond to the call; but my circumstances are rather unfavorable for such an event just now. When I was released from the San Juan Mission, some years ago, I was about "broke up." Having a large young family I thought wise to borrow money, buy a home and get my family sheltered at once. Besides keeping my family, and meeting my obligations as a Church member, I have been unable to do much in paying what was borrowed, except the interest, Hence I am still owing several hundred dollars. There is a prospect of my being able to pay some of this during this season, and my affairs would be in a better shape for me to leave home next year. Nevertheless, if required so to do I will get ready to go soon as I can. Should my services be required, now or one year hence, please let me know, and I will endeavor to arrange my affairs accordingly.

Feeling inclined to inform you of some of my circumstances, I take the liberty of writing you a few lines, sincerely ^desiring^ that you will read the same with consideration. I am a printer, (type- setter) and a native of Holland, have certificates of good workmanship therefrom and was em- ployed there as foreman for the last sixteen years. I have been in this country three years, made great progress in the English language during that time, but have much trouble in obtaining work. I have worked in Logan twice, but could not earn more than my board and lodging; I was in Salt Lake City for three months, worked six weeks on the Juvenille Instructor and a few days on the Deseret News; I then worked here on the Daily Post for eight months nearly night and day, of which the manager at ENDENTRY practized and used among the Sick and well of our people, would be of very great benefit. I have sent you this lecture for your ap- proval and recommendation, with which I would like to go to work now and lecture among the Saints. Please kindly dear Brother, return the same now to me in a safe way, and I having sent it in a registered package and no doubt it has reached you.  Please allow me to refer you to my explanatory letter, which accompanied my lecture to you, as well as the lecture itself.  Yours very Truly Brother in the gospel F. A. Neuburger.
