 then; but as that account may not be at hand I will briefly report on the inquiries made of me:We have a home two and one half miles from the centre of Ogden, in what is called Lynne, consisting of three acres of land, with a house of convenient size for our family and necessary outside conveniencies.This home with the improvements we have put upon it cost us, two years ago, about 1500.00. What it could be disposed of for, with the increase of values in property generally, since then, I could only make a guess at.When we moved to Ogden about sevenyears ago we had only what we brought with us in the thewagon that moved us here, but we concluded to borrow money and buy a home, rather than pay rent,and pay back the amount as fast as we could. We are still owing over$100.00 on that loan.Five years ago next March, we took stock of 5 shares in the Ogden Building and Savings Association, paying thereto 5.00 per month, which should mature between now and next fall.giving us a credit of $500.00Two years ago we were pursuaded by the officers of the Standard Pubs Co. to borrow $500.00 and take stock to that amount in the company, and this we have been paying interest on ^since then^ without any dividends to offset the expense, our circumstances being such that we were not able to lessen the principal of the debt.My salary in 1888 was $65.00 per month, in 1889 it was $70.00.We have no income only my monthly salary, which is as last year.Our family numbers five children, the oldest just turned ten years.

 Parowan, Iron Co. 5 Sep. 89Dear President Woodruff, I was at the house of Brother Thomas (I think his given nameis Elijah) at Leeds, and saw a slab of marbleless than a foot square, it was smooth andwhite except a slight cloud at one corner; and in answer to my questions learned the followingNot more than 5 miles from there in a cove 1/4 mile from water he had discovered a deposit of marble as he judged millions of tons,of various shades as well as white; easy to work.He supposed it was not wanted as there were other deposits of marble in the Territory. He didnot think to work it, and had not reported to any that could or that were interested in working the same; he had no objections to mereporting to such; I did not ask if he had takenany steps to sequre it.Br. T. is an old man and at times very feeble in health: is a man of extensive experience, hasthe irons of a press of his own inventionwhich possess great power and easily worked;the timbers are burned, and perhaps the inventionmay be lost unless he is encouraged to replacethe timbers.I tried to get him to revive the oil business;I think the last time I saw him he said he hadplanted what oil seed he had so as to have more for another season.If you wish to have the marble worked he would be pleased to assist in the same no doubt.Respectfully, Uriah Butt.

We have many goodpurposes in our hearts but short of meansto carry them into practice.I have long saw the need of a cement for roofs instead of shingles (which take the best of our timber) I have found the material or the knowledgehow to combine articles to form a substance nearlike indiarubber; I have tested it except by theaction of frost; I think it is of too flexible anature for frost to effect it much.Should be willing to place the knowledge inthe reach of our people for general use orthat it may be easily obtained by the poorestof our people, of course If I exported allthe material from here and no railway itwould be more expense than to save verymuch of the material in most of the settlements,^it is thought of no value by the people generally;^ some of the material would have to be madein the localaties where the fat pine exist; I knowhow to make the tar and pitch and couldsupply a very large ammount, and wouldteach others where it is expedient and they havenot the knowledge.

 January 7, 1890.THE TRINCHERA ESTATE.(Northern portion of the Sangre de Cristo Grant.)The Sangre de Cristo Grant occupies most of the eastern and southern portion of the San Luis Valley in Southern Colorado, and extends a short distance into New Mexico. Its title is perfect and a United States patent has been issued therefor, as Grant No.4, containing 998,780. 46 acres.It is bounded on the northest and east by the crest of the Sangre de Cristo range of mountains, and its western boundary consists chiefly of the Rio Grande. The Grant between the mountains and river averages 30 miles wide, and extends north and south some 50 or 60 miles.Blanea Peak, in the Sangre de Cristo range, the highest mountain in Colorado -- and probably in the United States -- (14,483 feet high) is the most prominent landmark on the northern boundary ogf the property. The Sangre de de Cristo Grant was cut into two almost equal parts by the owners several years ago, and the lower half of the Grant, consisting of 500,000 acres, was sold.  The division line extends from a point north of the Culebra Peak on the east due west to the Rio Grande, passing four miles north of the Town of San Luis on the Rio Culebra.  In disposing of the southern portion of the original Grand the owners retained

 much the more valuable half of the property.  Since the di-vision the lower portion has been known as the Costilla Es-tate and the upper portion as the Trinchera Estate.The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad enters the Trin-chera Estate at the summit of Veta Pass and traverses it in a generally south-westerly direction for about thirty miles, almost bisecting it. Fort Garland, the military post of the San Luis Valley, is situated near the center of the Es-tate and now belongs to the owners of the Grant.The accompanying map, which is an exact copy of the official map accompanying the patent, shows better than any description can do, the relative extent of mountains and val-ley land; also the boundary line between the two proper-ties.For practical purposes the property may be divided into irrigable and farming land, grazing land and the moun-tainous portion.The irrigable farming land is mostly situated along the Trinchera and streams tributary thereto, and the finest portions will be found above and below Fort Garland, extend-ing in each direction several miles, watered by Ute Creek and other tributaries of the Trinchera.  There is also some good irrigable land which can be covered by ditches taken out of the Rio Grande, both above and below the mouth of the Trinchera.The soil is mostly a rich sandy loam, and wherever water is obtainable, yields abundance of fine nutritious hay,

 oats, wheat, potatoes and other garden vegetables.  The cli-mate is not adapted to the growth of Indian corn.  The whole country forms an excellent cattle range. The streams which rise from the lofty mountains above refered to are so nume-rous that the entire property is amply supplied with water at convenient distances for stock purposes as well as for ir-rigation where the lay of the land is suitable for that pur-pose. Usually, during the summer months the cattle frequent the open country lying between the foothills and the Rio Grande. In winter they retire from the open country and are to be found grazing in the sheltered nooks of the hills and throughout the broken ground which covers the eastern and southeastern portions of the Estate. The foot hills and mountains slopes in several localities are covered with good timber for building purposes, which timber lands, unless very inaccessible, are valuable throughout Colorado, at all events wherever they occur within twenty miles of a railroad. There is much good tie timber in many parts of the Estate.Much of the land between the mountains and the open plain is covered with cedar, from which vast quantities of cedar posts can be obtained.  Such posts are very valuable, and yearly becoming more so.The mountains which form the northeastern and east-ern boundary of the property are mineral bearing in their character, and form part of the extended range which reaches beyond Aspen and Leadville on the north, and nearly to Santa Fe on the south, in which many prominent mines exist.

 pecting in the mountanous portion of the Grant has beencarried on to a very limited extent. Gold mines, however,are worked on Placer Creek and Grey Back Gulch, and an ironmine called "Placer Iron Mine", of great prospective value,has been worked, for which a royality of 25 cents per ton waspaid to the Grant owners by the Colorado Coal and Iron Com-pany. 11,862 tons of iron ore have been mined. The fol-lowing is an average analysis of this ore, which at once shows it to be one of excellent quality.Iron 54.34   Silica 11.28    Phosporus .085    Sulphur .207    Lime 5.46   Alumina 2.66    Magnisia 1.15    Manganese .41     A spur from the D. & R.

 they not been private property:  and until the owners of the Grant took active control of the property a good deal of un-authorized gold washing was carried on by little parties of miners who, whilst they made no appreciable impression on the placer ground as a whole, probably took many hundred thousand dollars in gold from the Estate. The present Com-pany has not thought fit to undertake any mining operations, inasmuch as none of the parties interested are mining men. No shafts have been sunk on the placer grounds by the Compa-ny. No efforts have been made by the Company to define their extent. Prospectors have been induced to find mine-ral by the offer of a certain length of vein as a reqward for its discovery; and on this basis the following mining deeds have been issued by the Company; To six claims, 1,000 feet long by 300 feet wide, situated in the west half of section 18, township 28, south of range 70, wetst and known as The Star of the West, Last Chance, Sunnyside, Homestake, Magno-lia and Hidden Treasure.Application has been made for some mining leases in the Sierra Blanca as a reward for the discovery of someveins in that section, the Company having recently changed its policy with respect to prospecting, now giving leases instead of as heretofore offering a small section of the discovered vein in fee simple. Some important discoveries have undoubtedly been made this summer of gold and silver bearing veins on the property, but the reports which have come to the office cannot be verified until the snow has left the ranges.

 The Trinchera Estate contains somewhat less than 450,000 acres. The exact acreage cannot be stated, because small sales are constantly being made to settlers.The nearest town of importance is Alamosa, situated on the Rio Grande, about 12 miles north of the point where the northwestern boundary of the property touches the river. This town seems destined to become one of considerable size.  It is already a railway center, from which one branch of the D. & R. G. R'd extends up the Rio Grande to Del Norte and Wagon Wheel qgap, another southward which divides shortly af-ter leaving Alamosa, one branch running through the San Juan country to Durango and Silverton, and the other continuing directly south to Espanola, in New Mexico, and thence direct to Santa Fe by a connecting line.No difficulty is likely to arise with respect to squatters on the property. There are four, or at most five farmers whose rights have been recognized by the owners of the Grant to the extent of 160 acres each, because they set-tled on the property at a very early date, and have rendered various services to the owners. These parties have receiv-ed deeds for their land upon paying the government price therefor. A few miners have acquired clearly defined rights under contract with the owners of the Grant, who offered in-ducements to parties to prospect for mineral within the lim-its of the Estate.Much attention has lately been directed to the San Luis Valley, and large irrigating canals are in course of contruction by the Colorado Loan and Trust Company and other

 Ditch Companies, for the purpose of irrigating large blocks of land situated to the south and west of Alamosa, which the last named Company has recently purchased from the State. Such active development on a large scale cannot fail to in-crease the value of the Trinchera Estate, which is contigu-ous to those lands.Following the example of the large ditch companies operating on the western side of the San Luis Valley the Trinchera Estate Company commenced surveys in 1887, covering the greater portion of the Estate, and early in 1888 it con-structed two main irrigating canals, one called Garland Ditch and the other The Trinchera Ditch.  The Garland Ditch istake from the Sangre de Cristo stream about a mile east and above Fort Garland. It extends some seven miles in a gene-ral northwestern direction, taking in on its way the waters of Ute Creek, and covering a magnificent body of farming land. This canal, as required, can be extended for several miles further. Its exact location is marked on the map. The Trinchera Ditch is taken out of the stream of the same name -- a fine stream -- just where it leaves the foot hills and enters the plain, and runs in a southwesterly direction to cover another body of fine land. It has been constructed for a distiance of five or sxx miles, that can be extended as required. Reservoir sites have been selected for the stor-age of water whenever it may be found necessary to do so.About 16,000 acres of land have been sold to set-tlers up to January 1st; for which the Company holds defer-red payment notes amounting to about $34,000.

 In order to raise funds for surveys, canals and o-ther improvements, a loan of $20,000 was effected, on mort-gage of a small portion of the property not immediately re-quired for colonization purposes. This money, togetherwith first payments on land sales, has all been judiciously used for the advancement of the property; so that the Es-tate is infinitely more valuable now than it was three years ago.Amongst the improvements the location of the new Town of Fort Garland must not be overlooked.  This new Town is situated on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad immediate-ly north of the old military post, and will probably become the County seat next autumn. Town lots are being sold here on the deferred payment plan.In connection with the sale of agricultural lands to settlers, water rights are also sold; and from these wa-ter rights a large revenue will doubtless be obtained. At present these water rights are sold at $3 an acre.  The ruling price, however, throughout the San Luis Valley is $5; but inasmuch as the canals of the Company did not cost as much as is usually the case, it was deemed best to commence at a low figure and gradually increase the price.The northwestern boundary of the property has been substantially fenced with cedar posts and barbed wire for a-bout thirty miles.Herewith are the forms of water right and land con-tracts in use.

 Ogden July 28 1890Prest Woodruff & CouncilDear BrethrenReplying to your favor of the 8th. After consultingwith ^the^ Bishops of the 4th & 5th wards Ogden in respectto available missionaries for Holland. We findthat the most of the brethren from that countryare recent arrivals have hardly had time to locate themselves and are very poor. There area few brethren who have been here longer, butthey have recently filled missions to that countryWe submit the following names of brethrenwith their circumstances &c.1 William Kolderwyne is in circumstances that hecould go on a mission to his native land. But herequires that the Bishop should take care of hiswife (he has no children) He wants it understood thatshe must be well looked after if he should be calledon mission.2 Benjamin Jensen is a native of Holland.has a wife is in debt for his home &c If he goeson a mission his wife will have to be supportedWe think he would make a good missionary.3 Albert Bell is also a native of Holland is at pre-sent unmarried but expects to marry shortly. Hehas a mother 72 years old lately from Holland whois depending on him for support. He was a missionary in Holland for several years before coming to 
 paper, and only 1 of the presentadvertisements is left therein, suchact would be punishable underthe law.He demands therefore a sum large enoughto enable him, wife and 4 children toleave here and go to Paris. He thinks by going thus away with a good sum, he saves us the ugly lawsuit, and a scandal, which theAmerican press eagerly looks for.Dear President, I bring this to your notice,and if you have to give to the Committeesome council, as we meet next Mondayat 730 in the Presidents Office, wewould feel greatly obliged to you.I remain your humble servantEdward Schoenfeld.at Z.C.M.I.

 I am obliged to write a long letter to you.The main cause is, that without mynaturalisation papers as a citizen of theU.S.of A. I am liable to be enlistedin the military service, for not less than3 years. and as I understand been severaltimes enquired for through my father back there. I am now 25 years old and becauseI came to this country before I was 18 yearsold, could get my papers by applying forthem at once even 2 years ago.Wy I have not or could not concientiouslyask for my papers I will briefly explain.I married my first wife in 1885 and inthe fall of 1887 married again in the LoganTemple and by this obeying a certain lawof God am deprived of citizenship.My second wife has a son 20 month old.and is in exile moving from one placeto another for the last 2 years.  I have ^been^ sofar preserved from the hands of Deputy Mar-shals.My first wife had 2 children, which both died at 15 and 6 month of age, since thefall of 1886 she has poor health, herailment is consumption on the lungs.suffers a good deal from coughing andis very feeble in body, able to be aroundbut unable to do her housework.She is a noble woman. virtous and trueand willing to make the sacrifice, that Ishould go on my mission, depending uponthe blessings of the Lord.  I am a watch-maker by trade and as my business inmy absence would stop, I have alreadylast April rented my new building tothe Payson Eseange savings bank for $200a year for 2 years, which I thought wouldsupport my family while on a mission.I was obliged to rent already in April, be-cause the bank wanted it then or not at all.and I made preparations to be ready this fall to fill my appointed mission.
