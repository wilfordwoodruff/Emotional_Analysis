 then; but as that account may not   be at hand I will briefly report on the   inquiries made of me:    We have a home two and one half   miles from the centre of Ogden, in   what is called Lynne, consisting of   three acres of land, with a house of   convenient size for our family and   necessary outside conveniencies.    This home with the improvements   we have put upon it cost us, two years   ago, about 1500.00. What it could be   disposed of for, with the increase of   values in property generally, since then,   I could only make a guess at.    When we moved to Ogden about seven  years ago we had only what we brought   with us in the thewagon that moved us   here, but we concluded to borrow money   and buy a home, rather than pay rent,  and pay back the amount as fast as   we could. We are still owing over    $100.00 on that loan.    Five years ago next March, we   took stock of 5 shares in the Ogden   Building and Savings Association, paying   thereto 5.00 per month, which should   mature between now and next fall.  giving us a credit of $500.00    Two years ago we were pursuaded   by the officers of the Standard Pubs Co.   to borrow $500.00 and take stock to   that amount in the company, and this   we have been paying interest on ^since then^ without   any dividends to offset the expense,   our circumstances being such that we   were not able to lessen the principal   of the debt.    My salary in 1888 was $65.00 per   month, in 1889 it was $70.00.    We have no income only my monthly   salary, which is as last year.    Our family numbers five children,   the oldest just turned ten years.

 a year ago last summer, my  wife's mother lost her home through  mortgage, leaving her with a young  daughter without a home and they  came to make their home with us,  and will probably continue to live   with us as she has no income for  support.    In regard to our feelings in the  matter, I have always felt that as  long as I am a member of the Kingdom  of God I am subject to the will  and wishes of the the Lord through  His servants as they deem it most proper.    My wife would much prefer to live  in her present home, where she can send  her children to school, with my society  also, but expresses herself as willing  to go or to do, as those in authority may  be led to dictate. Hoping these state-  ments will answer your request.    I remain Your brother in Truth  Samuel P. Richards.

 Parowan, Iron Co. 5 Sep. 89    Dear President Woodruff, I was at the   house of Brother Thomas (I think his given name  is Elijah) at Leeds, and saw a slab of marble  less than a foot square, it was smooth and  white except a slight cloud at one corner; and   in answer to my questions learned the following    Not more than 5 miles from there in a   cove 1/4 mile from water he had discovered a   deposit of marble as he judged millions of tons,  of various shades as well as white; easy to work.  He supposed it was not wanted as there were other   deposits of marble in the Territory. He did  not think to work it, and had not reported   to any that could or that were interested in   working the same; he had no objections to me  reporting to such; I did not ask if he had taken  any steps to sequre it.    Br. T. is an old man and at times very feeble   in health: is a man of extensive experience, has  the irons of a press of his own invention  which possess great power and easily worked;  the timbers are burned, and perhaps the invention  may be lost unless he is encouraged to replace  the timbers.    I tried to get him to revive the oil business;  I think the last time I saw him he said he had  planted what oil seed he had so as to have more   for another season.    If you wish to have the marble worked he   would be pleased to assist in the same no doubt.    Respectfully,   Uriah Butt.

 Parowan having only a very inferior quality  of lime when their is any on hand.    I saw a mountain with lots of light  coloured loose rock on the surface, so I  took several pieces home and burnt them  to see if it would make good lime; when  burnt to my surprise I saw specks of gold  the size of a pin-head more or less at short distances  all over the rock; I went and brought more  from diferent parts a number of steps apart  which on being burnt sparkled, some of them  however with other metal as I had taken a  variety of rock, some of them very dark colour  and very heavy; while the first mentioned when  burned pulverize very easily.  I pulverized  one rock, washed off some of the dirt that would  swim when stired and put a little quicksilver  with the other, afterward passed the quicksilver  through cloth which left quite a dusting of gold  on the cloth.    No one know of the existance of such metal here  (but my ^self &^ wife, and she know not the location,) and  we do not intend they shall from us; we want  to know we are right and then go ahead.

 and other relatives, so as to make it uninteresting  for outsiders; as they would not get employment  unless they could not be done without, and I think  there are our people who know how to work ores.    I am opposed to bringing the outsiders to our   settlements; but many of our men are most  all or a great portion of their time on the road  and in the camps with provissions at about  the price it is worth at home; and thus we  are extreemly poor.  We have many good  purposes in our hearts but short of means  to carry them into practice.    I have long saw the need of a cement for   roofs instead of shingles (which take the best of our   timber) I have found the material or the knowledge  how to combine articles to form a substance near  like indiarubber; I have tested it except by the  action of frost; I think it is of too flexible a  nature for frost to effect it much.    Should be willing to place the knowledge in  the reach of our people for general use or  that it may be easily obtained by the poorest  of our people, of course If I exported all  the material from here and no railway it  would be more expense than to save very  much of the material in most of the settlements,  ^it is thought of no value by the people generally;^   some of the material would have to be made  in the localaties where the fat pine exist; I know  how to make the tar and pitch and could  supply a very large ammount, and would  teach others where it is expedient and they have  not the knowledge.

 January 7, 1890.    THE TRINCHERA ESTATE.  (Northern portion of the Sangre de Cristo Grant.)    The Sangre de Cristo Grant occupies most of the   eastern and southern portion of the San Luis Valley in   Southern Colorado, and extends a short distance into New   Mexico. Its title is perfect and a United States patent   has been issued therefor, as Grant No.4, containing 998,780.   46 acres.    It is bounded on the northest and east by the   crest of the Sangre de Cristo range of mountains, and its   western boundary consists chiefly of the Rio Grande. The   Grant between the mountains and river averages 30 miles   wide, and extends north and south some 50 or 60 miles.    Blanea Peak, in the Sangre de Cristo range, the   highest mountain in Colorado -- and probably in the United   States -- (14,483 feet high) is the most prominent landmark   on the northern boundary ogf the property. The Sangre de   de Cristo Grant was cut into two almost equal parts by the   owners several years ago, and the lower half of the Grant,   consisting of 500,000 acres, was sold.  The division line   extends from a point north of the Culebra Peak on the east   due west to the Rio Grande, passing four miles north of the   Town of San Luis on the Rio Culebra.  In disposing of the   southern portion of the original Grand the owners retained

I should like to prove up on my farm and secure  it so I would not loose it before I go on a mission  and I can not do that untill next March 1891  My Father bought a store from Z.C.M.I. last February  he run it two months but the deputy Marshals followed  him up so closely he had to leave it so he sent for  me to come to Salt Lake City to make some arrangements  about the business. So I went to Salt Lake on the 4th of   April was their during Conference. Saw Father their bought  the store from him and gave my note for it drawing  interest but I can shape this business by next spring  so I can go, as Wm B Low will buy one half interest in  the business next spring and run it so I can go.    Wm B Low has run the same store for Z.C.M.I one year  and is acquainted with the business and the people he is now  working for Z.C.M.I at Eagle Rock.

 much the more valuable half of the property.  Since the di-  vision the lower portion has been known as the Costilla Es-  tate and the upper portion as the Trinchera Estate.    The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad enters the Trin-  chera Estate at the summit of Veta Pass and traverses it in   a generally south-westerly direction for about thirty miles,   almost bisecting it. Fort Garland, the military post of   the San Luis Valley, is situated near the center of the Es-  tate and now belongs to the owners of the Grant.    The accompanying map, which is an exact copy of the   official map accompanying the patent, shows better than any   description can do, the relative extent of mountains and val-  ley land; also the boundary line between the two proper-  ties.    For practical purposes the property may be divided   into irrigable and farming land, grazing land and the moun-  tainous portion.    The irrigable farming land is mostly situated along   the Trinchera and streams tributary thereto, and the finest   portions will be found above and below Fort Garland, extend-  ing in each direction several miles, watered by Ute Creek   and other tributaries of the Trinchera.  There is also some   good irrigable land which can be covered by ditches taken   out of the Rio Grande, both above and below the mouth of the   Trinchera.    The soil is mostly a rich sandy loam, and wherever   water is obtainable, yields abundance of fine nutritious hay,

 oats, wheat, potatoes and other garden vegetables.  The cli-  mate is not adapted to the growth of Indian corn.  The whole   country forms an excellent cattle range. The streams which   rise from the lofty mountains above refered to are so nume-  rous that the entire property is amply supplied with water   at convenient distances for stock purposes as well as for ir-  rigation where the lay of the land is suitable for that pur-  pose. Usually, during the summer months the cattle frequent   the open country lying between the foothills and the Rio   Grande. In winter they retire from the open country and   are to be found grazing in the sheltered nooks of the hills   and throughout the broken ground which covers the eastern and   southeastern portions of the Estate. The foot hills and   mountains slopes in several localities are covered with good   timber for building purposes, which timber lands, unless   very inaccessible, are valuable throughout Colorado, at all   events wherever they occur within twenty miles of a railroad.   There is much good tie timber in many parts of the Estate.    Much of the land between the mountains and the open   plain is covered with cedar, from which vast quantities of   cedar posts can be obtained.  Such posts are very valuable,   and yearly becoming more so.    The mountains which form the northeastern and east-  ern boundary of the property are mineral bearing in their   character, and form part of the extended range which reaches   beyond Aspen and Leadville on the north, and nearly to Santa   Fe on the south, in which many prominent mines exist.

 pecting in the mountanous portion of the Grant has been  carried on to a very limited extent.

 they not been private property:  and until the owners of the   Grant took active control of the property a good deal of un-  authorized gold washing was carried on by little parties of   miners who, whilst they made no appreciable impression on   the placer ground as a whole, probably took many hundred   thousand dollars in gold from the Estate. The present Com-  pany has not thought fit to undertake any mining operations,   inasmuch as none of the parties interested are mining men.   No shafts have been sunk on the placer grounds by the Compa-  ny. No efforts have been made by the Company to define   their extent. Prospectors have been induced to find mine-  ral by the offer of a certain length of vein as a reqward for   its discovery; and on this basis the following mining deeds   have been issued by the Company; To six claims, 1,000 feet   long by 300 feet wide, situated in the west half of section   18, township 28, south of range 70, wetst and known as The   Star of the West, Last Chance, Sunnyside, Homestake, Magno-  lia and Hidden Treasure.    Application has been made for some mining leases in   the Sierra Blanca as a reward for the discovery of some  veins in that section, the Company having recently changed   its policy with respect to prospecting, now giving leases   instead of as heretofore offering a small section of the   discovered vein in fee simple. Some important discoveries   have undoubtedly been made this summer of gold and silver   bearing veins on the property, but the reports which have   come to the office cannot be verified until the snow has   left the ranges.

 Salt Lake City,  30 Jan. 1890 188    Elder R. J. Dugdale,   Provo,    Dear Brother:    Your name has been suggested and accepted as a Missionary to   Great Britain    The work of the Lord is progressing in the nations, and faithful, energetic   Elders are needed in the ministry to promulgate the everlasting Gospel, openings   for doing good appearing in numerous directions. Yourself, with others, having   been selected for this mission, should there be no reasonable obstacles to hinder   you from going, we would be pleased to have you make your arrangements to   start from this City at as early a date as Wednesday, 9 April, 1890.    Please let us know, at your earliest convenience, what your feelings are   with regard to this call. If you accept it you will receive no further notification,   but will be expected to present yourself at the Historian's Office to be set apart on   the day previous to that appointed for your departure.    Your Brother in the Gospel,   Wilford Woodruff    P.S. Please have your Bishop endorse your answer. 
 The Trinchera Estate contains somewhat less than   450,000 acres. The exact acreage cannot be stated, because   small sales are constantly being made to settlers.    The nearest town of importance is Alamosa, situated   on the Rio Grande, about 12 miles north of the point where   the northwestern boundary of the property touches the river.   This town seems destined to become one of considerable size.    It is already a railway center, from which one branch of the   D. & R. G. R'd extends up the Rio Grande to Del Norte and   Wagon Wheel qgap, another southward which divides shortly af-  ter leaving Alamosa, one branch running through the San Juan   country to Durango and Silverton, and the other continuing   directly south to Espanola, in New Mexico, and thence direct   to Santa Fe by a connecting line.    No difficulty is likely to arise with respect to   squatters on the property. There are four, or at most five   farmers whose rights have been recognized by the owners of   the Grant to the extent of 160 acres each, because they set-  tled on the property at a very early date, and have rendered   various services to the owners. These parties have receiv-  ed deeds for their land upon paying the government price   therefor. A few miners have acquired clearly defined rights   under contract with the owners of the Grant, who offered in-  ducements to parties to prospect for mineral within the lim-  its of the Estate.    Much attention has lately been directed to the San   Luis Valley, and large irrigating canals are in course of   contruction by the Colorado Loan and Trust Company and other

 Ed. Shoenfeld.  Edward    Salt Lake City,  July 31st 1890    President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother,    Being one of the Committee of Supervision  over the affairs of the German paper, the  "Intelligenz blatt," I deem it my duty to  make hereby to You a report about some  of the recent occurrances.    Last Tuesday morning Mr. Jos. W. Dittrich,  the Editor, wrote to me, in my capacity as  Committee member; and told me, to take notice  and bring to the notice of the other members,  that in consequence of some reports  concerning him, as having indirectly  caused the arrest of one of our Missionaries  in Bohemia (Austria.), he feels so  embittered about the way he has been  treated, that he "protests as an under  the law legitimized Editor against the  further issuance of the above named  newspaper under its own or his name.

 Pleasant Grove Utah July 25th AD 1890    To the first Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter day Saints    Greeting    Holy and much respected Brethren  Think it not strange that a word should come to you  from one so obscure and lowly as the author of this short message  I am come from ^the Desert^ where I have bin for four years past under  the tuition of the Lord if I am not exceedingly mistaken, and  not being able to find rest, or relief from the burden upon  me in any other way, I am constrained to present it  before you, leaving the consequences to you and our God.    You may write it upon the tablets of your memory, and  in your Book, you may engrave it with the pen of iron and  lay it in the rock forever, that the Lord God spake, and  said unto me, that "All things whatsoever that is   done in my name from this time forth, that is not  for the gathering of the whole House of Israel, is not  from me saith the Lord of Hostes    Now Holy Brethren condesend to to hear council from  one obscure, humble and lowly, The Spirit dictates me to  say, the end of Joseph's dispensation is near at hand and  a new one soon to usher in, wherein the Saints must stand  in Holy places and wait the coming of the Lord, which  he, the Prophet Joseph foresaw and was permitted to know  the time ^(of the comeing dispensation)^ viz fifty six years after the going forth of the  Apostles to prune the vinyard for the last time    Now the Spirit presses me to council 
 Ditch Companies, for the purpose of irrigating large blocks   of land situated to the south and west of Alamosa, which the   last named Company has recently purchased from the State.   Such active development on a large scale cannot fail to in-  crease the value of the Trinchera Estate, which is contigu-  ous to those lands.    Following the example of the large ditch companies   operating on the western side of the San Luis Valley the   Trinchera Estate Company commenced surveys in 1887, covering   the greater portion of the Estate, and early in 1888 it con-  structed two main irrigating canals, one called Garland Ditch   and the other The Trinchera Ditch.  The Garland Ditch is  take from the Sangre de Cristo stream about a mile east and   above Fort Garland. It extends some seven miles in a gene-  ral northwestern direction, taking in on its way the waters   of Ute Creek, and covering a magnificent body of farming   land. This canal, as required, can be extended for several   miles further. Its exact location is marked on the map.   The Trinchera Ditch is taken out of the stream of the same   name -- a fine stream -- just where it leaves the foot hills   and enters the plain, and runs in a southwesterly direction   to cover another body of fine land. It has been constructed   for a distiance of five or sxx miles, that can be extended as   required. Reservoir sites have been selected for the stor-  age of water whenever it may be found necessary to do so.    About 16,000 acres of land have been sold to set-  tlers up to January 1st; for which the Company holds defer-  red payment notes amounting to about $34,000.

 He further says, that he will take lawful  steps to secure unto him his literary rights,  acknowledged in every Country, if  the Committee should refuse to tpurchase  his ownership or right from him.  I paid him a visit and there I  learned that he intends to leave   Utah and thinks we shall pay  him enough for this right or  ownership, to get away. I tried to  encourage him from the standpoint  of the Gospel, but aggreed to nothing  concerning the other matter. We  aggreed however, that the present   number (now in the press,) should  appear under its title, only Mr.  Dittrichs name should be left out.  I have notified Bro.

 In order to raise funds for surveys, canals and o-  ther improvements, a loan of $20,000 was effected, on mort-  gage of a small portion of the property not immediately re-  quired for colonization purposes. This money, together  with first payments on land sales, has all been judiciously   used for the advancement of the property; so that the Es-  tate is infinitely more valuable now than it was three years   ago.    Amongst the improvements the location of the new   Town of Fort Garland must not be overlooked.  This new Town   is situated on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad immediate-  ly north of the old military post, and will probably become   the County seat next autumn. Town lots are being sold here   on the deferred payment plan.    In connection with the sale of agricultural lands   to settlers, water rights are also sold; and from these wa-  ter rights a large revenue will doubtless be obtained. At   present these water rights are sold at $3 an acre.  The   ruling price, however, throughout the San Luis Valley is $5;   but inasmuch as the canals of the Company did not cost as   much as is usually the case, it was deemed best to commence   at a low figure and gradually increase the price.    The northwestern boundary of the property has been   substantially fenced with cedar posts and barbed wire for a-  bout thirty miles.    Herewith are the forms of water right and land con-  tracts in use.

 alltogether, unless we satisfy him  for his claim of ownership as founder  of the paper. He bases this claim  on the following points:    1. He is the founder and qualified  under the law.    2. It was not his intention to issue a   paper in the interest of Mormonism  purely; that he has been asked  in a correspondence from Washington,  whether he had read the article  "robbery of Church property" before he  published it.    3. If the paper ceases to exist, the Committee  still remains responsible to pay him  said recompence for the time of its  existence, because the Committee used  his paper as an advertising medium,  and contracted ^for^ advertisements to the  amount of 700 Dollars, without hiasking  him for his consent.    4.

 Ogden July 28 1890    Prest Woodruff & Council    Dear Brethren    Replying to your favor of the 8th. After consulting  with ^the^ Bishops of the 4th & 5th wards Ogden in respect  to available missionaries for Holland. We find  that the most of the brethren from that country  are recent arrivals have hardly had time to   locate themselves and are very poor. There are  a few brethren who have been here longer, but  they have recently filled missions to that country    We submit the following names of brethren  with their circumstances &c.    1 William Kolderwyne is in circumstances that he  could go on a mission to his native land. But he  requires that the Bishop should take care of his  wife (he has no children) He wants it understood that  she must be well looked after if he should be called  on mission.    2 Benjamin Jensen is a native of Holland.  has a wife is in debt for his home &c If he goes  on a mission his wife will have to be supported  We think he would make a good missionary.    3 Albert Bell is also a native of Holland is at pre-  sent unmarried but expects to marry shortly. He  has a mother 72 years old lately from Holland who  is depending on him for support. He was a mission  ary in Holland for several years before coming to 
 paper, and only 1 of the present  advertisements is left therein, such  act would be punishable under  the law.    He demands therefore a sum large enough  to enable him, wife and 4 children to  leave here and go to Paris. He   thinks by going thus away with a   good sum, he saves us the ugly   lawsuit, and a scandal, which the  American press eagerly looks for.    Dear President, I bring this to your notice,  and if you have to give to the Committee  some council, as we meet next Monday  at 730 in the Presidents Office, we  would feel greatly obliged to you.

Salt Lake City    Dear brother: There are a few  things, that I would like to place before  you regarding my call on a mission to  Switzerland and Germany, which I re-  cieved from you 30 Jan. 1890.

I have been in Salt Lake City from the  22 till the 24 of this month to speak to you  about the following, but as you were not in town

 I am obliged to write a long letter to you.    The main cause is, that without my  naturalisation papers as a citizen of the  U.S.of A. I am liable to be enlisted  in the military service, for not less than  3 years. and as I understand been several  times enquired for through my father back   there. I am now 25 years old and because  I came to this country before I was 18 years  old, could get my papers by applying for  them at once even 2 years ago.    Wy I have not or could not concientiously  ask for my papers I will briefly explain.  I married my first wife in 1885 and in  the fall of 1887 married again in the Logan  Temple and by this obeying a certain law  of God am deprived of citizenship.    My second wife has a son 20 month old.  and is in exile moving from one place  to another for the last 2 years.  I have ^been^ so  far preserved from the hands of Deputy Mar-  shals.    My first wife had 2 children, which both   died at 15 and 6 month of age, since the  fall of 1886 she has poor health, her  ailment is consumption on the lungs.  suffers a good deal from coughing and  is very feeble in body, able to be around  but unable to do her housework.    She is a noble woman. virtous and true  and willing to make the sacrifice, that I  should go on my mission, depending upon  the blessings of the Lord.  I am a watch-  maker by trade and as my business in  my absence would stop, I have already  last April rented my new building to  the Payson Eseange savings bank for $200  a year for 2 years, which I thought would  support my family while on a mission.  I was obliged to rent already in April, be-  cause the bank wanted it then or not at all.  and I made preparations to be ready this   fall to fill my appointed mission.

 Three Mile Creek  Box Elder  Box Elder Co  Aug 25th  1890    Pres Wilford Woodruff.    Dear Bro  by request of Sister Elizabeth Thomas  a resident of this ward I pen you  a few lines. Her son Jacob  Thomas a young man of 29 years  of age unmarried whose name  has been forwarded to head  quarters for some time as a  missionary was notified to be  in Salt Lake City on Septr  3rd to start on a mission to  great Britain. When he recd  his notification he was unwell  the contents of your letter did not  operate favourably upon him.  Hearing of his condition T. W.   Brewerton, M. W. Dalton, 
 Three Mile Creek Aug. 12, 1890    Pres. W. Woodruff    Dear Bro. The letter received  from you should and ought  to have been answered sooner.  But the information it contained  saying my name had been  suggested as a missionary to Great  Britain, caused me such a feeling  of sorrow and dread, on account  of a feeling to shun society, or of  being shy, nor never having been  away from home. You can judge  my feelings better then I can  explain them. But be it ever so  great a task, and although thinking   I can do no good. But to be obedient  I will try and be there, as stated  in the letter, if not otherwise notified.    Jacob Thomas ^Bp.^ C. A.  Terry 
 As a Mormon I can not get my papers in  this Territory, I was told by some Elders, that   I might apply for my papers in New York  or some other state while on the way to  Germany, but it ^this^ is uncertain.    I would prefer a mission to Germany  because none of my relatives are in the  church, besides I would like to gather my  geneoligy.  Whatever you will counsel  me to do under my conditions, I will  fulfill to the best of my ability.    The question is, how can I obtain my papers.    Please let me hear from you soon so  I can regulate my business accordingly.    Your brother in the Gospel  Adolf Haag

Woodruff  Dear Bro,    In reply to yours  letter calling me on  a mission I will say  that I am ready to  Go and will be in  Salt Lake City on  Sept 2nd to be set  apart Your Bro in  the Gosple    Pehr Cronquist    Prest W Woodruff    Dear Brother    I can Recomend Brother Cronquist  as being a good faithfull Latter  Day Saint    Thomas x Smith Bp  of the Seventh Ward of Logan City 
 Robert Henderson & Geo Davis  4 of the Presidents of the 59th Quorum  of Seventies of which he is a member  visited him, he was in a very singular  frame of mind and very weak in  body as he did not partake of scarce-  ly any food, his condition to-day  is not any better. I am informed  he answered the notification quite  a while after receiving it telling in  part his condition, but stating he  would be ready to start at the appoint-  ed time if not further notified.  He still says the same, but his  mother thinks in his present con-  dition it would be impossible for him  to go. Now I wish to say this in  behalf of sister Thomas & her son.  Sister Thomas is a genuine Latter  day Saint well informed in the  principles of the gospel and dare  not take the responsibility of offering  an unjust excuse, but is very much  exercised over her son's condition.    She has been a widow for many years,  if Jacob goes she has 2 grown up sons  left at home. The young man  is well informed, a strict observer  of Gods laws, always at his post  of duty, up to the time of his notifi-  cation. I suggested to sister  Thomas that she come down and  see the first Presidency and for her  son to come with her, she would like  to come but she says he will not  come with her until the time  appointed. Now dea[r] Bro I  have told the facts in the case  as near as I understand them  not assuming to take any  responsibility upon myself, but  to gratify the request of an anxious  mother.  If it is not out of place  to ask it, will you please answer
