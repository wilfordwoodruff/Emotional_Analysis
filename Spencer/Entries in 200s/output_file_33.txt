ENDENTRY        ENDENTRY        twenty-eighth in reference to me becoming a missionary to Germany, is at hand.  I feel it an honor to be counted worthy to preach the Everlasting Gospel, and will be ready to leave on the date fixed, April the eighteenth. I have for some time been studying the German Language, and will continue to do so, that I may fit myself for the mission that has been assigned me.   A. E. Hyde Jr.   Bishop   J. F. S. ENDENTRY
