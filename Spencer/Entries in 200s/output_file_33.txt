He is however peaceable disposed, but is lacking in the  "counterpoise" of gravity to insure steadfastness of character so necssary to success in life.  Religiously: In belief and sympathy he's is  an advocate of the faith and doctrines, of the church I have never known him to utter a syllable against  any principle taught by authority. He is more loud in his praises of our people, than he is forceable in his examples. He is kind and attentive to his parents when at home. And eulogizes their characters in  their absence. But he does what pleases himself. He attends Tabernacle services occasionally, but rarely  attends any other meetings. It pains me to have to  draw such a portrait of our son.

The note and mortgage are not due until the 28th of next April, the firm business is in the hands of an assignee and it is yet uncertain what the whether he will obtain sufficient from the sale, to liquidate their liabilities. While matters are in this condition it is within the power of any of the creditors of the late firm to make ^me^ defendant in a civil suit. If settlement cannot be made by the late firm, it may be necessary for me to commence action to close the mortgage.
