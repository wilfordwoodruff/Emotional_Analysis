 JAN 1st 1859      January 1, 1859 ~ Saturday      This is a vary plesant New Years morning. One year   ago this morning I reflected in my own mind upon the  scenes which lay before us as a people and asked the Question   whare another new Year would find me and my Brethren for   we were threatened with war and extermination by the General   Government and an armey of several thousand men lay upon our   borders ready at the opening of spring to try to begin to put their   threats into Execution but the Lord has warded off the blow & we   still occupy our houses, gardens, orchards, fields, cities & Tabernacle  and this is the Lords doing, & it is marvelous in our Eyes. and   we now have the army in our midst under the form of peace  we have the United states courts in our midst who are striving   to stir up strife in the midst of this people May the Lord protect   his saints through 1859 and in all time to come from the   evil design of our Enemies And may he so lead the President  & Congress of the United States that they shall not be able to   accomplish any evil design against the Church, Kingdom  & Zion of our God which dwells in these vallies of the mountains  but may the Lord so guide & controll the helm of state   so as to give us a state Government or esstablish the Kingdom   of God on the Earth May he inspire the heart of his servant   Brigham continually with power, light, & truth so that He may   continue to lead the Church & kingdom of God in peace &   safety as he has done heretofore untill the saints of the Most High  shall possess the kingdom in power & Glory and be prepared   for the comeing of the Son of Man      I spent a part of the day in the office & the evening at home  Several of the Brethren called in & spent the evening with me  Lorenzo Snow, S.

I told the Bishops when I first came     
 Jan 31  to this country to build their school houses on a plan which   I gave them there has been many wings built but not  a centre building in the Territory I would classify all   the children I would put the Little children all together & I   would take a girl or some one capable of teaching them & I  would have a good Black board and I would teach the Alphabet  upon that one book would be enough in the Room I do not   believe in putting Books into the hands of Little children to   pour over & make them sit on a hard Bench untill they ake  all over. If I was a Teacher I would make them rise up &   march around the house and I would try to interest their  minds so they would delight to learn but many persons   who have learning sufficient to teach a school yet they are   not fit to teach children as soon as a child does sumthing   that does not pleas the teacher He begins to pound the child  with a ruler over the Head & back or slaps him in the side of   the Head with his hand this is not the way to treat children  You put a work into the hands of a Jerman Frenchman  Dane or Sweed or any other Nation printed in the Deserett  Alphabet & in a little time they will all read and spell alike   much sooner than they could learn a new language several   of the brethren spoke D.

Richards John Sharp Bishop Hunter, Dunbar & W Woodruff   with their Ladies & Col Little with their Ladies composed the   company. we broke up at about 12 oclok      The committee of the board of Regents met at President Youngs  & continued to write theChrist sermon on the mount on the black Board      February 3, 1859 ~ Thursday      3rd I called at the office in the morning & spent the day scraping  I spent the evening at home the young folks had a  party at our house till midnight. The Regency Committee   met at Presidency Youngs & spent the evening on the Deserett Alphabet      February 4, 1859 ~ Friday      4th I gave Bonds in the penal sum of $5000 for   the faithful performance of my duty as Inspector of   the Penetentiary. Jeter Clinton & James MCknight   were my bondsmen. I filed in the office of the Auditor   of public accounts viz Wm Clayton at Capt Hoopers  Office. Luke Johnson is in this morning From   [FIGURE] Rush Valley with Ormus Bates I was informed   that Gov Cummings would not sign a Bill repealing  the Rush valley herd ground he would not sign away   the rights of men I spent most of the day in the office scraping      February 5, 1859 ~ Saturday      5th In company with Luke Johnson & son I rode to Samuel   Benyons took dinner then rode to John Benyons we walked   out 4 miles to Brother Benyons Herd of sheep & help him  drive them in I had lost 10 sheep 9 Ewes & 1 weather &   they were in his flock & I wished to get them we spent the night wit him     
 February 6, 1859 ~ Sunday      Feb 6th  {Sunday} As soon as It was light enough to see we commenced   to examine Brother Benyons herd of sheep to try to   find my own I found the number which I had lost   with my ear mark but Brother Johnson had put a Brand   of a J on the forehead & it did not show ownly on five   & Brother Benyon did not wish me to take ownly the  five that showed the J But the other five belonged to me   as much as those which I took we put the 5 we got   into Samuel Benyons Heard being 4 yearling Ewes   & 1 Black Bweather with left ear croped & a hole through  the right ear. we then rode Back to the city 24 mi      My Quorum met in the After noon [blank] Prayed in  [blank] was mouth. I called in to the presidents office  & President Young made some remarks. Elder O Hyde  told a dream which he had last fall. He saw the prophet  Joseph who told him we should conquer in the first  campaign. President Young we shall conquer all the  time if we do right for I can tell you the time has   [FIGURE] come when the Lord will sit to Judge the Nations   and he will controll things in such a manner  that the people of the world will not understand that the  Lord has any thing to do with it, no more than the Jews   did in the days of the Savior. He said their are some   officers in this city from the Armey, some companies  that wish to kill some men thinking that will start  up a general war and we must be on the watch.  Mr Wm Martin told S. M. Blair that Benjamin Clapp  & about 40 others in sanpete was going to Calafornia  Martin had Bought Boxes heard out to fit them out  Italy was making a Demonstration against Austria   and France was sustaining Itialy in it. The Papers say   that the Government does not sustain Sinclair in   his chair to the Jury in Utah. President Young said   He dreamed that President Buchanan sent him a fine   time peace saying you may now regulate your own time  I expect He will soon send us the time peace or pass the   act giving Utah as well as other Territories the right  to Elect their own officers which I consider to be the   time peace. The Govornor may soon call the Legislature  to gether and Elecht their own officers and Regulate   their own affairs. I met with O. Hyde O. Pratt &   C C Rich of the Twelve in the prayer room O. Hyde prayed. O   Pratt was mouth we conversed upon the things of the Kingdom   of God spoke of prayer & fasting. O. Pratt said that He  had often wished that He could get faith enough to enjoy   the Blessings the ancient Apostles Enjoyed He said Joseph  taught that unles the Apostles and Elders of this Church  did fast & pray untill they could get the Heavens opened   unto them so they could see the face of the Lord their testimony   would not be worth much to this generation. Brother Hyde   moved that we asked the privilege of President Young to Fast   and pray as a Quorum in the Endowment House for one  week to which we all agreed     
 February 7, 1859 ~ Monday      Feb 7  I spent the day scraping I met with the board of Directors in the  evening we Elected J. C. Little Treasurer & agreed to talk with   Wm G. Mills for corresponding secretary & T Bullock for secretary  James A Little made a good report of his Travels & lectures      February 8, 1859 ~ Tuesday      8th Luke Johnson started home this morning I spent the day  scraping. I spent the evening with President Young & the  committee of the Regency they have commenced a Dictionary  are at work on A[o]. I called upon Leo Hawkins He was vary poorly      February 9, 1859 ~ Wednesday      9th A plesant morning I spent the day in the office scraping I  spent the night at home reading with my family      February 10, 1859 ~ Thursday      10th we had a hard snow storm last night their is some 5 inches   of snow this morning I spent the day scraping which fin[ishe]d  up the winters mails. I spent the evening at Presidents   Youngs exerciseing on the black board till 10 oclok      February 11, 1859 ~ Friday      11th I spent the day in the office. S. M. Blair called in & said to   me that Govornor Cummings told him that He was going to   the states & thought Col Johnson was going also Govornor   Cummings has been informed that Congress intended to  Repeal our organic Act organizing Utah Territory, what   [FIGURE] they intend doing with it I am not informed.      Elder G. A. Smith arived home at 7 oclok He called upon   President Young a short time. The committee of the Regency  spent the evening with President Young writing Hebrew in   the deseret Alphabet on the black board for, exercise. I spent   the evening at home teaching my Family the Deseret Alphabet      February 12, 1859 ~ Saturday      12. I spent the day in the office examining letters for History I   spent the evening with the board of directors of the D A & M  society we appointed Thomas Bullock our secretary as R Campbell  had resigned in consequence of a multiplicity of busines.      [FIGURE] I wrote a Letter to Joseph Harris & sent 1 subscriber      February 13, 1859 ~ Sunday      13th Sunday I attended meeting at the Tabernacle Gilbert Clements  Preached upon the first principles of the gospel was followed by  Elder O Hyde with a strong exertation He objected to any  person selling whiskey & then coming into this desk to preach   which Brother Clements had done yet he did not call him   by name. I met my Quorum my son Wilford Prayed   & I was mouth in the circle. The first Patriarch of the  church Joseph Smith sen blessed me & my wife Phebe he   said I should have sons who should bear the Holy Priesthood  & be great men in the Earth & be honorable men in Zion  while he [Wilford] was praying I thought of my Blessing. I spent  an hour with President Young in the afternoon. He spoke upon   the subject of the Book published by Mother Smith called Joseph   Smith the Prophet He said he wished us to take up that work   & revise it & correct it that it belonged to the Historians to   attend to it that there was many fals statements made in   it and he wished them to be left out and all other statements   which we did not know to be true, and give the reason why they   are left out. G. A. Smith & Elias Smith should be present     
 Feb 13  That Book makes out william smith according to Mother   Smith's statement to be full of the Holy Ghost & the power   of God while at the same time I herd him say in the   presence of Heber C. Kimball while Joseph Smith was a   prisioner in the hands of his enemies and I said that God   would deliver him, william smith said Dam him Joseph   Smith ought to have been hung up by the neck years ago   [FIGURE] and Dam him he will get it now any how.      President Brigham Young said wm smith is the most   wicked man I ever saw in my life He has been filled   with all manner of wickedness. When I was in Nauvoo   I commenced to build me a carriage william got up a rumor   that I was Finishing a carriage for my own use which   Joseph had commenced for his mother then Mother Smith   soon reported that I was building her a carriage and   the first time she got me in company she asked me   for that carriage I did not care much about the carriage   but I was sorry to have her take that course. w woodruff  remarked that Mother Smith was under the influence of wm   smith and the spirit of Aposticy which was in Nauvoo. President   Young said yes I do not think the Lord would impute Evil to her   and I shall meet with her in Eternity and I am sure I shall   not bring an Accusation against her. Elder O Pratt published   that work & bought it of A. W. Babbitt at a high Price when  we had a copy of it in our office, it is marvellous that He   should have published it without my council. Many other   remarks were made by President Young (see private Journal)  I met with the Twelve in the prayer circle I opened by prayer   G. A Smith was mouth we conversed upon a variety of   subjects we agreed to meet as a Quorum a week from   tomorrow for prayer and fasting. Letters were written to   John Taylor and Lorenzo Snow to meet with us       [FIGURE] during the evening Bishop Heywood & Richard Balantine came   before the Twelve and made a report of their doings at salt   creek they had got into a difficulty with the Bishop & people   sumthing in the following manner they claimed to be acting as   Missionaries sent by Brother Kimball or Brother Hyde in preaching   in that place Brother Balantyne did not think He was received   as a missionary should be and He told the people the history of   that place showed that they had been in the habit of rejecting  the servants of God this gave offence to the Bishop & people in   connexion with other things, and he would not make satisf-  action and teachers was sent to laboured with them Brother   Balantine called upon the Bishop Bigler & he considered that   he was grossly insulted and he told Br Balantyne to leave   his house or he would break his Jaw. Brother Bigler had   written a letter upon the subject said that Balantyne had   taught that Haywood was the President of the place & that Balantyne   had privately thaught the people that Brigham Young would be  massacreed bey the armey &c. The Twelve decided after Hearing   the case that they would dismiss Elders Heywood & Balantyne   from any further missionaryies duties at Present & G. A. Smith   wrote to Bishop Bigler saying that the Twelve thought that He   would have a more salutary influence with kind words     
 Feb 13  and looks instead of a blow with the fist or a kick &c      February 14, 1859 ~ Monday      14th [FIGURES] we found about one foot of snow on the ground this   morning the Eastern mail came in this morning I spent  an hour in the Presidents office looking over the mail but   we did not find much News I received one paper & a letter   from Elder Lorenzo Snow, and a letter to his sister E. R. Snow   which I delivered to her and had some conversation with her   concerning her Brother Lorenzo. I wrote to Brother Snow   an answer to his Letter I spent the evening in the office G. A. S   was present & herd the Book Entitled Joseph Smith the prophet red   and found many errors in it      I had a conversation with D Huntington upon the subj[ec]t   [FIGURE] of a conversation with Arrowpene & Ben Simons as   follows. Arrowpene had Been to camp Floyd for several   days He came to Dimick Huntington & spent the night also   Ben Simons they lay and whispered to gether all night and   Brother Huntington said he was full of Hell Arrowpene was   sullen and he said in the morning the mormons was the cause   of the death of Pintets. Huntington asked him who told him so he   was silent a while then said Nobody. H. Yes sombody told   you so was it the Black bearded man. He said yes then Ben   Simons said that Dr Hurt had said that the Mormons had   teased the Govornor to send the soldiers to chastize them   the Indians & this was the cause why they shot Pintets   Ben Simons said some body had got to die for Shooting   at him last winter in the mountains he did not say   who it would be their is no dout but what Dr Hurt has   tried all the time to stir up the Indians to war against   the morning Arrowpene said that He could not tell what He  should do untill the snow should go off.      February 15, 1859 ~ Tuesday      15 I spent the day on History and the evening at home in   the evening. Elder H C. Kimball & D. H. Wells called during   the evening. G. A. Smith made out an account of the   Early History of the Smith Family for Brother Kimball   History      February 16, 1859 ~ Wednesday      [FIGURE] 16th I spent the day in the office on History I wrote   a letter to John Bennion about sheep I met at the   8th school house at a water meeting we Elected Br   Nobles as the first water master over the canida ditch   Brother Sanders over another ditch Wm Smoot over another  dit[c]h & Brother Turnbow water master over the Wilen   dit[c]h      February 17, 1859 ~ Thursday      17th I spent the day on the History in the evening Brother  Fox arived from Rush valley some of the soldiers have  been killing some cattle of the brethren & insulting the   people      February 18, 1859 ~ Friday      18th It commenced snowing about 8 oclok from the North   with strong wind the air was filled with snow   I spent the day on History. President Young called upon us  a few minutes and left with G. A. Smith I spent the evening  at Home & red a Book entitled Revolution in Russia     
 February 19, 1859 ~ Saturday      Feb 19   The earth is coverd with snow this morning I spent the day on History   I met with the board of Directors of the D. A. & M.   society we regulated the premium list and appointed the   committies over the various classes      February 20, 1859 ~ Sunday      20th Sunday I attended meeting at the Tabernacle Jacob   Gates spoke first & gave a good exertation & was followed by   Elder O Pratt who spoke much to the Edefication of the people  At the close of the Meeting I met with my prayer circle A   Hoagland prayed & J. C. Little was mouth      I called upon President Young a short time E. T. Benson   [FIGURE] C. C. Rich Erastus Snow came in. President Young said   their was a Hand Bill stuck up in the city for a Ball with   Thomas Williams Name to it, I have had a ticket or invi-  tation to go to the Ball and it is rumoured that Col Johns-  on would attend, but if Col Johnson waits for me to make   a Ball and bear the expenses of it & invite him to in in   order to see him He will wait a good while And if Col   Johnson is the man I take him to be I do not think He will   come over to Join these Rowdies in their Ball. There is   many of this Church who does not know the diference   between inviteing our Enemies, the Gentiles, ^or^ the wicked to   Join in our feast or dances, or gioing to their parties & being  under their dominion. If we invite a wicked man to   our dance we preside over him. If we go to his party He   presides over us and has an influence over us. If Col   Johnson will stay whare he is and maintain his own Group  I have no objection I mean to stay whare I am and main-  tain my own Ground by the help of the Lord      I met with the Twelve in the circle C. C. Rich prayed & E. T. Benson  was mouth we made some arangments about prepareing for  a Prayer & Fasting meeting of the Twelve Apostles      February 21, 1859 ~ Monday      21st Feb 1859 The Twelve Apostles met at the Prayer closit   in the Historians office for Prayer & Fasting. There was   Present O. Hyde O. Pratt W. Woodruff G. A. Smith E. T. Benson   C. C. Rich Lorenzo Snow Erastus Snow & F. D. Richards      O Hyde opened by Prayer & spoke upon our position   and the day in which we live said the gospel had been   beging among the Gentiles for 30 years & he believed the   time was soon over he believed the time [was] at hand when the   Gentiles would beg for the Gospel      G. A. Smith Prayed in the spirit of the Lord and asked   for all things necessary for the Church & kingdom of God   the salvation of the Presidency, Twelve, our family & all Israel   & the destruction of our Enemies       We then sung come all ye that love the Lord      O pratt Prayed that the Holy Ghost might be poured out   upon us, that our hearts might be filled with good desires   that we might be taught to pray & what to ask of the Lord   we then sung O our Father thou that dwellest     
 Feb 21st  W Woodruff prayed and called upon the Lord to pour   out his spirit upon us & give us the gifts of the Holy Ghost   to Bless and preserve all Israel who would keep the comma-  ndments of God & to curse & destroy our Enemies who would  not repent but seek our destruction       We sung this Earth was once a Garden Place       Erastus Snow spoke said he felt rather stupid but he had  a great desire to enjoy the Holy spirit. He talked as stupid  as he felt, and I thought rather Quenched the spirit, but he   prayed and asked for many things which were good      O Pratt spoke and said that as Brother Hyde first remarked   that in attempting to pray this morning his tongue was all   doubled up and seemed hard work to speak O Pratt said that   it made him think of Brother Whitmer before he saw the  Angels he had to struggle hard with the powers of darkness  and in one instance the Devel appeared in the form of a   personage and he had to contend with that person & overcome  him, then an angel of God appeared to them Joseph said that   Moses was visited by the Devil and He said to Moses son of   Man worship thou me He told the Devil that He was a son of  God and he would not worship him soon the Lord appeared to him      C. C. Rich recommended that no one speak unless he had  the spirit of God but to pray then we would have a good meeting   several ingaged in the conversation.      O. Pratt said there is one thing I think would be of advan-  tage to us in prair the Lord has said that whare two or   three agree as touching any thing it shall be given you He   said we should cast in our minds what the spirit would  wish us to ask for, then we should agree and all ask for the  same thing and exercise all the faith we could upon that   one thing, now if we asked for a hundred things & all diferent  it does not seem as likely to be answered as though we asked   for a few things the Nephites when Jesus appeared to them   asked for the Holy Ghost and it was given them      O Hyde said the He must confess that he was more   stupid & dull than He wished to be he thought it was in   consequence of going without food & tobaco, which he   had been in the habit of useing. He said if we get the spirit   of the Lord & pray in the spirit we shall be agreed       W. Woodruff spoke & said that we were living in an impo-  rtant eria & that God required much at our hand as the Quorum   of the Twelve Apostle, the Heavens were full of Judgment for   the wicked & Blessings for the Righteous, and the Lord has said   that He would be inquired off theby the House of Israel to [do thoes]  Blessings for them we should be united in asking for what we   want & we should go before God & ask him to stay our Enemies   & hold them that they shall have no power over us we may     
 Feb 21st  not be confined to one thing we want the Holy spirit & we will   ask for that and we will ask the Lord to Hold the congress of the   United States & all our Enemis in that way that the will of God  may be done He said this year would be more filled with Judgments upon the   wicked than any year we have seen & 1860 will be far more so   E. T. Benson said that He fasted 3 days and was blessed in int  and thought we should not be discoraged but fast & Pray and   ask the Lord for what you want. Now if we use coffee, tobaco   whiskey, & stuff ourselves ^with^ meat we will be like the Gentiles & can-  ot expect much of the spirit unless we prepare our bodies for it   I believe that Good will grow out of this meeting       G. A. Smith said that I understand the Idea of Brother Pratt is   that we be united in what we ask for but not to limit us I   know that we want the Holy spirit. And one of the Greatest  Gifts that we want is wisdom to help us to use the Holy spirit   when we pray we want a gr[e]at deal of wisdom to know when   to speak & when to be silent, as to the congress of the United States   their is not ten men but what want to cut the throats of the   Presidency & Twelve Apostles and I want to Pray God to curse   them & give them No power over us & I want to pray for the   removal of the armey. Joseph Smith wrote his ^dedication pray^ prayer & went   and read it to the assembly & some were tryed with it      We all dressed in our robes. Lorenzo Snow prayed &  F D. Richards was mouth and prayed long and asked   for many things ^for^ the Church & Kingdom of God       The Brethren then spent a short time in mixed conversation   concerning the the death of Joseph & other things. we then   adjourned till tomorrow 10 oclok, ^1/2 past 3^ I spent the evening at home   I met in the evening with my family and taught them the   things of the kingdom. Elder Lorenzo Snow spent the   evening with me. The mail came in the evening      February 22, 1859 ~ Tuesday      22nd I called at the President's office in the morning to see the  Mail but few papers came in & not much      The Twelve Met in the prayer closset at 12 oclok their being   present O Hyde O. Pratt W. Woodruff John Taylor G. A. Smith   E. T. Benson Lorenzo Snow, C. C. Rich Erastus Snow F. D. Richards      Elder Taylor opened by Prayer and asked the Lord for all   things nessary for the saints       O Hyde wrote a note to H. C. Kimball giving him an invitactoon   to meet with us       we conversed upon variosus subjets till 1 oclok   we then sung A poor wayfareing man of grief       E. T. Benson Prayed & called upon the Lord for his   Blessings upon all the Authorities of the Church and upon   all Zion and for the Holy spirit to be poured oput upon us   and for the Lord to hedge up the way of our Enemies that   they shall have no power over us     
 22nd   we then sunag come let us Anew our Journey persue      O. Hyde Prayed in the spirit of the Lord and asked for evry blessi-  ng upon the Church & Kingdom of God which the free spirit of   the Lord dictated unto him      Erastus Snow spoke concerning the feelings of many of   the people against seeing the Twelve prosper in Temperal things  He thought if the Lord did not sanction this, He permited it to  be & he thought perhaps it was not the will of God that we should   [be] engaged in Temperal business when I was ordained Brother  Brigham told me to lay down my hoe & all farming tools & labouring  in the ministry and I do not prosper in any temperal business  F. D Richards said he Brother Snow had spoken his feelings  exactly he did not feel like engaging in any temperal Business       C. C. Rich spoke upon the same subject & said that He did not  no as all the Twelve all experienced the same thing but I think  the people are exercised by a spirit othat they do not comprehend  or know what it ment but their is an opposition to Joseph &  the Presidency & Twelve against their prosperity. I think we  should use wisdom in the preservation of our bodies & lives we  have received a gospel and principles which will save us, but  we must apply it to our bodies as well as to our souls in the season  thereof in [order] to be saved.      Brother C. C. Rich called upon  the Lord in prayer and asked the Blessing of God upon us       Lorenzo Snow spoke, was thankful to meet with us & when  He herd of it thought he would undergo a great deal in order  to meet with us, if we did not have those great & marvellous  things that was manifest on the day of Pentecost yet it was  good to meet & pray and while our Enemies are seeking our  overthrow we should call upon God for our protection we are   differently situated from the Ancient Apostles they had  not the kingdom of God to build up as we have. Now the power  seems to be assimulated among the people & not confined to one  or two men or Twelve yet I consider Brigham Young is  performing a greater work in saving providing and orga-  nizing his family, in the way he has than he would to divide  the waters, or heal the soals, cast out Devils, or do other miracles  and the wisdom of God is with him with regard to our atten-  ding to temperal matters I think we shall have to attend  to temporal matters & understand them in order to build up  the kingdom of God, I have no dout but that if Bishop  Hunter would take care of our Families & we do nothing els  No doubt we should be great & powerful men in spirit  & make the hearts of men tremble & be filled with the power  of God but would this benefit the people more than for us  to know how to teach the people in temperal things       O Hyde said I have thought of the subject as Erastus spoke of   but I have thought it was best for us to take a medium course  we must have cares and if we could do as Bishop Hunter  spoke of we might become dry & dull I believe we shall     
 have a variety sometimes fat & sometimes lean & sometimes noth  ing we shall have trials but I think we ought to do our duty    magnify our calling and trust in God and all will be right  I believe the day is not far off when the Twelve will have  all that is necessary. He related a dream about Bull[i]on &  gold &c. J Taylor said I will prophesy that it shall be  fulfilled Lorenzo Snow said I will prophesy that the Moon is  made under which it shall be fulfilled. O Hyde said I will  Prophesiy that the time will soon come when we shall have all  that we want       E. T. Benson asked how much wood O Hyde got at Sessions  settlement He said he had paid $5 for one load of maple wood  of the Bishop that is all that I had in that settlement.      we had a mixed conversation upon the subject before us we finally  concluded to fulfill our mission ^first^ and be industrious and provided  for our families as well as we can & then trust in God      February 23, 1859 ~ Wednesday      23rd The Twelve met in the Prayer closset at the   Historians Office at 1/2 [past] 120 there being present O. Hyde  O. Pratt, W. Woodruff J. Taylor, G. A. Smith E. T. Benson  C. C. Rich, Lorenzo Snow Erastus Snow F. D. Richards      O Hyde made a statement of his doings in New Yourk  at the Time that Roberts was overturning the church through  fals doctrin. The course was sustained by Joseph Smith  His instruction to the Twelve was read. B. Young said  that when any one of the Twelve was abroad it was their   duty to preside & regulate all things      O Hyde Prayed in the spirit of the Lord and then spoke  said he wished the brethren would pray and aske for those  things which we want & contend for it untill we obtain  I feel as though we shall not always be kooped up here  I do not believe we shall always be together but the  Lord will call ous out we have a work to do in the Earth  the Lord has said "with you I will rend their Kingdom,  saidth the Lord" will this be done while we are here, we  must pray for the spirit of God to be with us      At a quarter to 12 oclck H. C. Kimball & D. H. Wells called  * H. C. Kimball said this madtoe me think of the time when  I returned from England JosephJames [illegible]Foster ^was president^ & the presidency of  the Seventies ^they^ had met with a seers stones to see what they  could see when I went in they treated me vary cool &  Z Pulsipher said dont be excited Brother Kimball is  Nothing but a man, they treated me vary cooly & I went  home and wept* The 12 all rose up & shook hands with them &  recieved them Joyfully      O Hyde explained to Brothers Kimball & Wells what we  had done, and would like to hear from them      Brother Kimball said I consider evry ruling man in  the Church that has the Holy Ghost is a prophet seer & Rev-  elator & he should have the spirit of that office     
 Feb 23   G. A. Smith Read ^from the Doctrin & Covenants the duty^ the Authority of the Twelve Apostles Br   Kimball said it was plain. The Nations were spoken of whare  the layws were so hard that the saints could not enjoy the  gospel openly. F. D. Richards spoke of esstablishing several  Branches in Dresden in a secret manner through the mercy  of God       Brother Kimball conversed upon a variety of things refered  to the stakes which the Twelve once set to see an Angel but  we did not seen an angel but prayed ourselves into darkness  He spoke of the time that Joseph tried the Twelve but the  Twelve was united & tied Joseph down & Joseph said now  dont you now never let any body tie you down as you have  me. Brother Kimball said we appointed ^Joseph nominated^ G. A Smith to  take the place of Thomas B. Marsh and Lyman Shermon  was appointed to take the place of Orson Hyde But Brother  Sherman ^was vary^ was taken sick & died in 3 days ^shortly [illegible] after^ Brother G. A. Smith  said when he heard of Brother Shermons death He thought  his time would soon come. Brother Kimball said ["]it was not  the will of God for a man to take Brother Hydes place. The  Twelve can ordain men to the Apostleship and give them  all the power you have and you have all that we have got  But you cannot make a prophet ownly the natural way  and a man cannot be a patriarch & not a Prophet for a   man may have the spirit of a prophet before he can bless  and prophets [prophecy]" The gifts & callings of God are without  repentance there are thousands of prophets among the Gentiles  and spiritualist that have not Repented or obeyed the  gospel there are natural gifts to men if they would  receive the gospel their gifts would be made more manifest  G. A. Smith Red some in the Doctrins & Covenants, H. C. Kimball  said I always believed that Lyman Wight would be saved. I  never had any but good feelings towards him      Joseph Young came in at 1 oclok      President Brigham Young came in at a quarter past one oclok  W Woodruff red the minutes. President Young said  Brother Box said the Armey was wanting to get up a viga-  lance committee & wanted to get my head. But they will  not do it. well Brethren I called in to see you a minute  I supposed you called meet to gether to know more, well I  wish we all understood our calleding & ministry before   God. At the time Brother Kimball speaks of the Twelve We   praid untill it was so dark we could hardly see to get down  stairs I then ^last time I met with the Twelve in Kirtland^ [I] praid to God with all my heart that I might  never again meet with that Quorum and I never did  I dont want you to run in to the same thing with the spirit they possessed  Brethren I will say one thing to you that you should understand  that evry minute of our lives we should watch vary carefully  evry thought act and word in such a manner as not to  grieve the spirit of God. I do not know how your feelings  are here but when you close you should ask what advantage  it has been to you and if you have gained any ^thing by^ profit by it  if you meet for past time to pray for your friends & Enemies that  is right, but if you meet to fast & pray & call upon the     
 Lord for special Blessings you will have to be vary careful not  to indulge in light or vain conversation because it will grieve  the spirit of the Lord. I met with the various quorums of  the Church & many of the councils of the Church are like   the door upon its hinges we are as we were, But we should  improve by every opportunity we have. He then left us  Brother Kimball said as Brother Young has opened the way I  will say the less you to meet to gether to talk over matters the less  better it will be for you, to meet & complain of one another  and of the Presiden[c]y, or the people it is not profitable for you  & if I had been in Brother Woodruff's Place I would not have  red what he has I would not have written them.      Brother Kimball said bear with me untill I get through and  be kind to me and I will be kind to you and if you will always  take my council you will find it will lead you into the kingdom  of God & that you will not find in Books      The Brethren spoke in social conversation upon a variety of  subjects. Brother Hyde said I will remark concerning the object  of our meeting it was not to get cloven tungs to set upon us of  fire but it was to convers & pray together & ask the Lord to  preserve us & to overthrow our enemies, we have stuck our stake  but was glad to have the Presidency come in with us      H. C. Kimball said I will predict in the Name of Jesus Christ  if you will be one with the Head, the Presidency and sustain them  and you will never see the Body of Christ moved or disturbed  I do not mean members but the Body, untill the coming of  Christ and if you will be one with the Presidency not any  of you or the Presidency shall fall by the Armey or By the  Gentiles But you shall all be crowned in the presence of God  you are connected with all the prophets and Apostles from  the Begining and they are united with us and will sustain  us if we do our duty, And we shall never be broaken up  if we will be united all Hell cannot move us you unite with  the presidency and have an Eye to the head all the time, & sust-  ain the Head & no power will prevail over us. I have the best  of feelings towards this Quorums if these two Quorums ownly  Just stands together the kingdom will stand and prosper  go to and prune yourselves & begin at the root Brother  Brigham told it that we should not do any thing but what  we know is right      Brother Wells said I rejoice to meet with you I was glad  to hear that you was going to meet I feel like a little child  among you you have more experience than I have I offten  fell not qualifyed to fill my calling but by the grace of God  I fell to try to do my duty but one thing I no it is the work  of God and if any of us get in the way it will rooll on without  us for the Lord will carry it on. I have a great desire to have  the spirit of God so that evry act thought & word may be except-  able before the Lord we should triy to healp Brother Brigham  I have tryed to help him & have been called upon by him to do  many things that I though[t] many others was Better Qualifyed     
 Feb 23  to attend to But I have done it freely & for that things I believe  it has [been] excepted I am thankful to see the Twelve & Presidency  so well united and the friendship & confidence the Twelve   have in me this is our safe guard the devil has not the power  over us that many think when we are united we should try  to keep the devil out of our houses & out of ourselves sometime  we may have a member in our houses who will let the devil  dwell in their tabernacles we cannot always help this but if  we are firm before the Lord we will gain ground untill we  will bind the devil and cast him out of our houses & finally  out of the church I feel to Bless you my Brethren this Quorum  of the Twelve Apostles with evry feelings of my heart in  the Name of Jesus Christ and by all the Authority that God has  given me let us be up & doing & feed the flock of God the  saints are weak many of them, and are tempted & tryed & they  wanted feeding & if you see any thing in me that is wrong I  wish you would come to me and tell me esspecially I should be  much oblieged to you to tell me any fault before you tell anybody   els. I consider it is a great blessings to belong to the Chiurch of  Christ I never did ask for any office in the Church of Christ  I want to be passive in the hands of God. I never did have those  great manifestations that some have I have thought that I  would like to have some of those manifestations if it was the will of  God but not if it is agoing to do me any harm I would not wish  to see an Angel or hear the voice of God if it would make me  apostitize or do me an injury but let us act for to day &  we will have all the Blessings that is necessary for us      O Hyde said I believe & I may almost say I know that   there is not a feeling among the Twelve against the Presidency  and do not offerd up a prayer without asking God to Bless the presid-  ency & call them by name.      The question was asked had we  not better met hear evry thursday to fast. Brother Kimball  said I thing if you will meet with the people you will have  more of the spirit of God than to meet here      Preside[n]t Kimball dismissed us and Blessed us in the name of Jesus  Christ and said we should be blessed and the spirit of good should  be with us and be with our wives, and it should rest upon  the Earth around about us and these are the begining of Good  Better days      February 24, 1859 ~ Thursday      24th A cold wind I spent the fore part of the day in the office we read   G.

Smoot I [prayed]  I called upon President Young. He had been poorly through  the day but said he felt better now he was going to take  a warm bath in the evening sent for Dr Sprague. He said  he believed that Cradlebaugh would fizzle out in his court  and not be as long winded as Sinclair was while speak-  ing. A messenger arrived From Provo with Letters to the  Presidency & others. Cradlebaugh called the Jury to him  or he met with them & gave them another charge  told them that when 12 of their Jury agreed to find  a Bill & if their foreman did not agree with them  to appoint one of their number Foreman & write up  the Bill a Bill found signed by the Foreman recommend-  ed them to appoint a clerk & to keep a secret Book  for their benefit & destroy it when they got throug  they were sworn to secrecy & must not tell there  Procedings while out of court. He explained the reason  why he had called a company of soldiers to his aid  to guard the Prisioners &c. Brother Carrington read  a Letter to Brother Calkings, from the President and  some other Letters. In speaking at the funeral today  of Brother Hardy's child I said little children when  they died went home to God who gave them and I  had no fears about them not half as much as I   had about those who lived. I had great anxiety abo-  ut the children of theis people that they might walk  in the light of the Lord & be prepared to sustain this  kingdom in their Generation I said those who were  faithful in keeping the commandments of God would  have their children again but those who were wickd  & would not keep the commandments of God would be  separated from their children for their children  would inherit a Celestial Glory while their wicked  parents would be thrust down to hell therefor it becomes  evry Parent to keep the commandments of tGod that  they may have their children in the family organiza-  tion in the celestial world.      We are having a terrific cold snow snorm the wind blows  a gale & exceding cold it was a vary cold distressing night  for cattle.

Unless  the Lord wards off the blow it looks as though we was  to have war & Bloodshed our Enemies are determined on  our over throw as far as possible But I have faith to believe  that the Lord will protect us as he has done.

I visited 2 Brethren at G. A. S. House {Bishops Evans and Walker and advised   them to leave as they expected his house to [be] searched and also visited Bishop Blackburn and snow and advised them   not to write any letter}      March 27, 1859 ~ Sunday      27th Sunday Orson Pratt Preached in the Tabernacle to a  small congregation. I met with my Quorum J. G. Willey Prayed  melted A Hoagland was Mouth we had a snow Storm but it soon  melted off [FIGURE] I spent the fore part of the day in assisting Wilford  to make out his Journal of his life. I have taught him to keep a  Journal of his life to commence while young & keep it up through  life as I consider evry good man should do who holds the Holy  Priesthood & record his official acts that his children and future  Generations may know what he has done & the dealings of the Lord  with him. I met with the Quorum of the Twelve F. D. Richards  Prayed. O. Pratt was mouth. we called upon the President  & spent the evening. History of Napoleon was read a short   time.

Col Johnson has leave of absence and the command  is to be left in the hands of Col Smith who is said to  be bitter against this people. Origon has been admitted as  a state. The Homestead Bill was a tie in the Senate & the  Vice President gave his vote to lay it on the Table for the  PresidentPresent we are having another PrStorm of snow      March 29, 1859 ~ Tuesday      29th we have another snow storm I have never seen such a  winter in this country so long, could, [cold] and so many storms  the winter has commenced early and held on vary late it is  now the 29th of March & still snowing       Governor ALFRED CUMMING Has issued a proclama-  tion to the inhabitants of Utah protesting against the proc-  eding of the United States Courts in calling out the  Army to protect his court or to intimidate the witnesses  Jurors & citizens, of this territory I spent the day in the  office on history I finished reading the Letters of 1846.

A young sprouse followed his example & swore  he would shoot a mormon he mounted his mule & shot 3 Balls  into the croud & run the croud shot 6 Balls at him while  running, shot one ball into his mules neck Hart also run away     
 March 30, 1859 ~ Wednesday      March 30th  Brother Meeks got in from Provo last night reported that   the Judges & Armey were vary mad at the Extra. The proc-  lamation had Just arived but not circulated when he   left. They had privately examined Durfee and he had  tried to implicate President Young and this is what our  Enemies have been triying to hier some one to do a long  time. But their is not a man in the world who can   sware in truth that President Young advised anyone   to murder any body he has always advised evry man   when he has advised at all not to shed Blood except in   self defence. It is a vary cold day I wrote some today  to Lorenzo Snow. It is rumoured to day that Col Johnson   has 100 deserters in Irons in his camp and he had one   man whiped 120 lashes on the bare back who swore he  would kill the man who sentenced him to be whiped as   soon as he got a chance, we learned that the snow was   vary deep south and their had been No communication with   any settlement south of Fillmore for several weeks      I had two dreams last night. I dreamed of having a terrible  [FIGURE] battle with a rattle snake he tried to bite me all over   but did not seem to hurt me after I awoke I again fell   [FIGURE] asleep & and dreamed that I had an orchard of several  acres of Appletrees and I thought the ground was covered   with vary large red ripe Apples I thought there was  hundreds of Bushels so ripe that they must be used up  in order to save them I was making preperations to  make them into cider when I awoke. An express came in  last night bringing the reports of the court they are mad at   the governors Proclamation      March 31, 1859 ~ Thursday      31st   I herd the report of the doings of the court Judge Cradlebaugh threat  ened to arest Gov Cummings they came near a collission some   boys threw stones at the centinels they reported that to the com-  mander [who] gave orders oif any more was flung to fire in the direction  and if the fire was returned to kill all the prisioners immediately  it seems a difficult matter to keep from having a collision   between the citizens and troops.      [FIGURE] I attended the funeral of Sister Woolley. A large congre-  gation assembled, there was also President H. C. Kimball  & D H Wells presient also O Pratt W Woodruff J. Taylor  G. A. Smith E. T. Benson & Erastus Snow, also Bishop Hunter  Hunter & many Bishops & Elders they sung "O My Father thou   that dwellest." O Pratt Prayed. Another Hymn was sung  Elder O. Pratt then addressed the People. And said what  I may say I do not know, but I hope I may be led to say   what will be for the best. Since I came here my eyes have  been saluted with one thing, and that is that death has power  over all things that we see. we are called upon to part with  our best friends and have them taken away from us what   we now see in death, and what has happened from the Beginning  in like manner will all the millions who now dwell upon the   whole Earth will be called to pass through the same change. If we   had no knowledge of God we should feel vary diferent from what   we now do. If we thought our bodies would lie in the dust and  never be raised again we should have great cause to mourn     
 March 31st  but we have learned that the being which inhabits this Tabernacle   will live forever and not die. we have to lay our tabernacles  in the dust but they will again be resurrected with an immor-  tal body for Jesus Christ through his death and sufferings  restored unto all the children of men the privilege of the resurrec-  tion of their bodies, and if we keep a celestial law we shall  have a celestial Resurrection but all the righteous & the wicked  will have their bodies again. we cannot imagin the greatness  of the glory of the saint of God after the resurrection. Notwithstanding  all that our bodies suffer in this life in pain sorrow & distress   the want of food &c still we cling to them and do not wish to  give them up. we do not realize the great difference there is in  being in this world or probation & the next all the knowledge we  formerly had was taken from us when our spirits took these   bodies some think we never did exist till we came here because  we cannot remember any thing neither can we remember any   thing of the first year or two of our existence yet our spirits  remained in our bodies as much as they do now but as soon as   our spirits leave these imperfect tabernacles or rather bodies  cloged with mortality & evil our spirits will be in lively reco-  llection of evry thing that took place with us before we came   here and all things appertaining to us since we came in this  world. It is right for us to take proper care of our bodies and   do right & when we have done that we should leave all in the   hands of God and not be over anxious for our lives for if we are  faithful I expect we shall be raised in the morning of the first   Resurrection. And if we expected to be crowned Kings and   Priests & sit upon thrones we want experience in this world and   the next in order to be prepared for thes things. If we were   to be judged by the knowledge we once had before we came  here it would not be right, for we have to be judged according  to the light we have and if we break the Law of God after having   received great light and knowled[ge], our condemnation would  be accordingly. when the righteos come forth with their resur-  rected bodies, they will have great Joy in the remembrance   of their faithful deeds while the wicked will have great  sorrow in the rememberence of their wicked deeds, & the persecu-  tion of the saints, their sorrow will be increased a thou-  sand fold while the Joy of the saints will be a thousand fold  It has been thought by some that when the spirit leaves the  body that will never be called upon to labour either befor or   after the resurrection, but I believe that all the children of  God will be called to perfore duties through all Eternity as  great as they are capable of performing, that they may  continue to receive the blessings of their Father in heaven      Those who lived and died before the coming of Christ who were   faithful received their resurrected Bodies after Christ arose   and if you are faithful you will also have your resurrected   bodies at the second coming of Christ and when we   come to meet with them we can then tell our labours &   toils over together each in their generation, and if they   had persecution so have we, and if they were driven from  their homes & had perils for Christ sake so have [we] and we  can be mutual in our communication together     
 March 31  And the Zion on the Earth will ere long metet with the Zion  of Enoch and there we will greet each other and we shall  have such Joy as we have never seen on the Earth  President Heber C Kimball then spoke a short time He said  in regard to what had been said by O. Pratt is all good.  In regard to the abobe [abode] of departed spirits I have no doubt  but this wourld will stand forever. Jesus says in this world  ye have tribulation but in me ye have pease, But I am going  to say a few words about Sister Mary W Woolley, we call  her dead she is dead in one sense, but not ^in^ another. I have  known her before she was in the church, she is a good woman  she has always stood by her husband and has been true to  him and if she has been true in this life she will be in  the next and have her reward which will be the case in  the next probation with all. I believe in many Probation  When Sister Woolley gets in the next probation she will  sit down with Sarah and the ancient Holy woman as well  as the Prophets and Apostles who have lived in this proba  tion when they go into the spirit world they sit down with  Abram and the Patraiarchs and Prophets. She has had  many troubles in this life but she has got through them  all and I am confident she will sit down with all the  Holy men & women in the Eternal world. and will   remain with them Eternally. what she has past through  she has done for salvation and she has stood it well and  now has gone to rest, and I can say of a truth that I know  that she is now well off and all is well off with her. She has  sustained Brother Woolley in carrying out the doctrin of the   Patriarkal order of marriage and this because God had  Had commanded it we have often herd President Young say  that He did not enter into it because he likied it but because  God had commanded it. If we had not done it we should have  been damed. He commanded Law Marks & others to enter into it  but they did not obey the word of the Lord and they have gone  and denied the faith while we remain and God will sustain  us here in the mountains, true yes it is as true as the sun,  and those who are faithful will be saved sister woolley  has been true and so has Brother Woolley and their sons  and daughters have been true men and women and  I say God Bless you Brother Woolley and your family  and I Bless you all that are faithful But a curse will   come upon the Nation that has sought our destruction  and as God lives what the nation seeks to bring upon us  will be brought upon them so we must be patient, the   Lord has them in his power and they cannot move ownly  as the Lord permits and God will regard all that we have  done in the Temple of God and we will have to fully carry  it out and if we have not done wrong or broaken our cov  enants we shall receive all that has been promised unto  us and all will be right And may God grant that all may  come upon our Enemies that the Lord may wish to bring  upon them.

Soon capt A. B. Miller of the firm  of Wardle, Russell, Miller, &c called in to see President Young   & had quite a long interview with him. He said there   were two & a half Millions of Dollars worth of goods   at First cost on the road for this market there is more  than 1000 waggons loaded with merchandize with 2 1/2   tons to the waggon. I think there is more than one   million dollars worth of good more than can be sold in  this market for the next year. The western Merchants have  been anxious to sell goods to come to this Market for they   paid up so well last year but they will not be as anxious   to sell to the transient Merchants next year for it will be   a long time before they will get their pay & I expect we shall   have to buy out the Merchants in this City before they get through   There is a vast amount of Cattle, Horses, Mules, waggons,   goods & people on the way to this Territory. Cattle will   be cheap this fall, though many young cattle will be  driven through to Calafornia. Mr Miller said the people   estimated that the mormon Emigration alone will be 25000.   President Young said he did not think there would be   1000 Mormons, an Indians said all the white men   East were going to Utah. they pulled up some grass & asked   the Indian if he could tell whare it come from ior if He   would miss it from the field of grass before him. He said   No they told him it was so with the white men they were  not missed whare they came from. Mr Miller thought   Mr Livingston Bell & Co. will loose some $20,000 $30000 or   their contract on Flour. President Young thought not, that they  would by their flour for goods at a high price & would probably   samve themselves. Mr Miller said that much flour would     
 July 1st  be wanted ^He wanted^ flour to feed about 1500 men mostly at Bridger, many  men who are on the way to Calafornia will come through here  to get their flour. Mr Miller says that all Freight can  now bye carried from St Louis to St Joseph either via Rail  Road or Steemer for 15 cents per hundred He said that a rail  road would be in operation to Kansas City in two years      President Young said Mr Miller perhaps you can inform  the people whether the Armey in this Territory belongs to  Majors Russell Miller & Company, or the United States for  many people are at a loss to know who it belongs to. Mr   Miller Did not answer Direct. President Young asked if   they were going to let us live a little longer here. He  said yes the army will be reduced to 1000 men by fall  we must keep them moving to keep money stiring. President  Young said there is going to be a great sale of Mules they   will be sold cheap & go out bought back deear. Miller Nodded  assent. Presidet Young said I under stand that you brought  word that Stephen A Duglass stands Fair to be the candidate  for the next President. Miller said He was sure to be the  next President the South has to unite on him to get votes  in the north so as not to get Defeted. If he is President  I shall do business in this line for 5 years then I will   quit but Wardle will remain in Washington to regulate  affairs there & attend to business. He said they had got  the contract of carriying the Utah & Calafornoia Mail & has  the whole controll of it & all the government transportation for  the army. After some other Remarks Mr Miller took  his leave.      After he left President Young Remarked  that I cannot tell what to believe by what Mr Miller  says, He talks so much he does not expect to be believed  in all he says, He has a motive in view in calling here he  wants to lay a plan to make our boys his servants in  carrying the mail if Wardle Majors & Co tell the Army to  move to any place they will move for that company has   all the power in their hands except the buying of the flour  Mr Miller Further said that Just before I left we received  2nd A telegraphic Dispach not to organize 1500 larg freidt [freight]  waggons for Utah & New Mexico we sent word that they  were to late for we were already organized Mr Russell   went immediately to washington to see what was up      July 2, 1859 ~ Saturday      2nd S.

He did not recommend the present  system the people would not be satisfied with Capt Hooper & Capt  Hooper would not be satisfied with the people in the plan & it  would prove a curse to both parties, & we would see sorrow   in it He said the best thing we could do for the people would   be to raise sheep mix black & white wool make sheeps  gray & cloth the people. If this community had done  as much as I had to introduce sheep the whole Territory   would make their own clothing I would make my  own clothing & wear sheeps gray it is good Enough for  me & my family & I should wear it but my Friends  give me fine clothes & I wear them out of respect to  them I told my family that when they had used   up what they had on hand I should not buy them any   more they must color with the products of this land I  should not buy any coloring stuffs from the states "I shall  not stop my labor untill we can make nails and Iron  I have sent for nail machines & intend to make our own  nails we have spent $20000 dollars to make Iron & if  those ingaged in the business had not had the devil in  them we should have made good Iron before now But  I mean to keep to work at it untill I accomplish it  I will here reveal a secret which I have not told Bell  & Livingston came to me last summer & asked my  advise they told a sald tale of losses & said they could not  sell sugar & coffee short of 65 cts cotton cloth 35 cts and   all things in proportion I told them to ask it for I     
 July 6  did not believe their were 20 fools in this territory but I  found there were thousands He sold all his stock out at  those high prics before winter I beat myself in giving   that council I wish they had charged $1 per lb for groceries  if the people are amind to be fools enough to give it. I have  not bought goods of these merchants they have paid me  $7000 in gold annually for rents & I have sent most of  it to the states for goods. I hope I shall have an opportunity  of telling Mr Bell that He will not get my influence as he  has done with this people at the close of his remarks   He & Brothers Kimball & Wells Left I made a few remarks   sustaining President Young in his remarks & moved to  adjourn, sin[e] die it was carried & the meeting adjourned      July 7, 1859 ~ Thursday      7th G. A. Smith & A Lyman took the stage for the South  Country at 8 oclok this morning I spent the morning  in wattering I went to the office at 11 oclock I met with  Elder Danea C. R. Dana He had made a statement while  in England to Orson Pratt that when my life was preserved   on the night of the 5 day of July 1848 by moving my   carriage from an impression which I had to move  it, also to move my mules from an oak tree standing  beside the road, Both of which I done (see my Journal  of July 5 1848) He says that He had the impression &  urged me during the afternoon several times to do it  he also sayes that my mules were turned out & not at  the tree both of these statements are incorrect acor-  ding to my best knowledge & belief & recollection & the  account of my Journal, & testimony of my Journal  written next morning & testimony of my wife &  Dominicas Carter, both of which were present, I told  Brother Dana that I considered his statement not  true I havd no recollection of his saying any thing  about it untill I named it to him, and I knew I  moved my mules from the tree & tied them in a  Hickory grove whare I found them in the morning  He had been to the trouble of making a New Journal  whare he had detailed the account at great length  apparently to esstablish his version of the story But   I am of the impression that he has told the story so   often that He received a Revelation by which my life  was preserved that He either believes it to be true  or wishes to try to maintain what what He has stated  so often. He did not move the waggon in which he slep  himself and the tree fell in about 1 foot of it, I felt  thankful to the Lord for preserving my life & I wish  to give Brother Dana all the credit which belong to him  in the affair But I have No recollection of his saying  a word about it to me untill I named it to him  Neither has any one who was with me any recollection  of it this I told him & we parted both of firm in   our own belief I spent the afternoon in the office

President Young called at the   Office a short time Hoosesea Stout received a Letter from  David McKenzie wrote a letter to requesting Him to  come & plead his cause & bring such evidence as he thought   proper He was accused of Forgery. H Stout asked   President Youngs council. He said He did not wish to   talk about it but said The Lawyiers were not required     
 July 11  by any law to go to that camp & he should not do it & if   He was his Lawyier he should advise him to let the Judges   do as they pleased at the examination & if I was in his   place I would Neither Deny nor Confess any thing but would   remain silent. if he is guity he ought to be Cuffed for   I have employed him for 2 years & paid him & helped   his family & for such a man to ingaged in such a business   I feel like spanking him they seek evry opportunity to   Hatch up an accusation against me. If MCKinzie will   tell the truth it will be all right as far as I am concerned   But if my enemies can get him to lie against me or any  body els so they can make a war on me then their will   be a fight on hand and this will be as soon as the Lord will  Brother Hosea wrote to MCKinzie that the holding of a court   at Camp Floyd in a military camp was illegal & contrary   to the instructions of Judge Black & President Bucannan   I shall not come to plead any cause in that camp      A man called upon President Young & informed him that  he had found a good bed of stone colal on the Webber from   4 to 10 miles above the mouth of echo canyon He found three   veins of the coal about 3 feet each & the man is an old col[yier ]  He ingaged to deliver to President Young 100 tons of coal at   $20 per ton      July 12, 1859 ~ Tuesday      12 President Young called into [Co&] Commission Room  E.

H Stout said that  Wilson remarked that He expected that Judge Cradlebaugh   & Sinclair would Join Issue against Buchannan & Judge  Black. But whatever they done Stout said they would   Be mean themselves.

Also Joseph & Brigham Young Jr was  introduced But they soon left. Mr Greely asked President   Young what is the difference between your religion & Church  from the Christian world. B. Y. The difference between us is  that we believe that No Church is the Church of God who   has not the Holy Priesthood. We have the Priesthood & the  sects of the day have not got it. The Lord has delivered the   Priesthood unto us & without the priesthood no man has auth-  ority to administer in the ordinances of the gospel. G do you   believe in faith & what is it" B Y We do. Paul said it was   the substance of things hopede for & the evidence of things ^not seen^hoped for.   G. What do you Believe about slavery. B. Y. We believe what   the Bible sayes about it, there was a curse put upon Cain   & his seed & that curse will remain untill it wais taken   off they were to be servants. G is this a slave territory   or are there slaves here. Y There is slaves here or have been   from time to time. G Then this would become a slave state  would it not if it was admitted. Y. No the climate & situ-  ation would not admit of it. slavery is a thing I do not   want any thing to do with it. I consider it more of a  course [curse] to a man to have slaves than a Blessing. G So I   think. do you tithe the people if so what for. Y. Yes  one tenth to Build Temples, & to Feed the poor, and I   want you to understand one thing & I want you to write  it just as I tell you & that is I do not have so much   as one cabbage or ear of corn of the tithing ownly what  I pay for. G Do you have a salary. Y. No sir not one   cent. G Then how do you get your living. Y I would   think myself a poor financeer if I could not work   for Nothing & keep myself. There is No man from the  Highest to the lowest in the Church that Has a salary. The   Presidency Twelve, Seventies & all the Elders who labour for   the interest of the Church do it without a salary the Elders   travel the world over as it were & go without purse or   scrip or money & all preach without a salary. While building   a Temple in Kirtland we had a committee of three who   spent there whole time they were allowed $1 per day each   man. We had a committee of three in building the   Nauvoo Temple they had $2 per day each. We I do not no  know of any other who have a salary. Joseph Smith   on[c]e gave H. C. Kimball credit of $2 on Book for some   labour. Brother Kimball had it taken off said he would   not have a credit for it. We have appointed a committe  of one Mr D H Wells here to superintend the building  of a Temple here. He has No salary. I prefer a committe     
 July 13   of one instead of any more to transact any kind of busines  if I want to do it with dispatch then he does not have  others to council but can act upon his own judgment  we hire men ^& clerks^ to work in the Church who spend all ther  time as day labourers we pay them wages. G. Do not  the Bishops have salary's Y. No Sir. [G.] Are all the Mormons  under obligation to gather together and upon what principl  are they required to gather. Y Yes we consider  ourselves under obligation to gather together By the comma-  ndments of God the Bible teaches the subject of the Gathering  in the last days. G we have understood that the Bible  teaches the Jews to gather to old Jerrusalem Y. Yes &  it also teaches the Saints to gather to Zion. G Do you   think there can be any collission between the Mormons  & the United States. Y Not if they let us alone & do not  persecute us more than we are able to bear, but they can  croud us to a point which would make a collission  [G.] What was the cause of so much oposition to Joseph Smith  they accused him of stealing Horses & cattle & doing much  Evil. Now the Methodist used to be much opposed &  were vary unpopular But I do not recollect of hearing  them accused of such crimes as the Mormons are  I am vary unpopular in my religion I am a whole  souled Universalist yet we are not accused of such  crimes & I do not recollect that the Saints were in the  days of Christ. B. Y I think sin if you will look   carefully at the History of Christ & the Apostles you   will find that all manner of Evil was spoken against   them falsly. As to Joseph Smith he was a good man  & he was persecuted even unto death becasuse he did  do good. He passed through over 30 law suits got up  by his enemies & it was shown in evry instace that  He was innocent & it was got up through persecution  G What are the Danites and what information can you  give me concerning them. Y I cannot give you any   information conserning them you will have to enquiring  of our Enemies & they can tell you all about it, we know   nothing about any Danites we have no such society or  company among us. G You are accused of many crimes  Y And so were the saints in the days of Christ & the Apostles  evry exertion has been made from the begining to Bring some  accusation against us while trying Joseph in Missouri before  Judge A King. He asked Joseph if he believed in the setling  of the kingdom in the last days that the prophet Daniel spoke  of Joseph said he believed what the Bible said about it the  Judge said clerk put that down that is treason Col Dona-  phan who was Josephs Lawyier said you had better  make the bible treason & don with it. In the days of Christ  the Jews said if we let him alone he will come & take away  our state & Nation that is what our enemies are afraid  of now that we shall esstablish the Kingdom of God  G do you believe in infant sprinkling. Y. No we baptize  Believers By ememersion. G do you believe in any New     
 July 13  new doctrin Y no none ownly what the Bible & Book of mormon  teaches, have you not read the Book of Mormon G But vary   little of it. How extensive are miracle in the Church & are   they confined to the leaders of the Church. Y They are as  extensive as it is the will of God to give they arne not confined  to the Head But all Elders lay hands upon the sick when   called upon and the sick are often healed. G yes but some  die I suppose. Y Yes the saints & sinners have died in  every age. Death has passed upon all mankind & they cannot  escape it. G Your doctrin of Polygamy is not that   against the Bible. Paul said A Bishop should have one wife  Y. that is correct Doctrin you should not take a single  man for a Bishop he should at least have one wife But  Paul did not say that he should not have but one there  is nothing in Pauls words against his having a dozen  [G.] How many wives has any one man had in the Church  B. Y. I suppose I have as many as any one man I have  some 15 I have some aged women sealed to me upon the  principle of sealing which I no more think of making  a wife of than I would my Grand Mother. G Has it   been long that Poligamy has been practiced in the Church  Y it has ben practiced for some 16 years have you not read  the revelation given upon that subject G I have not I think  it has not been published till late. Did Joseph Smith have  more than one wife. Y The revelation was publishis  in Aug 1852. Joseph Smith had more than one wife  G How do the women receive the Doctrin Y Quite as  well as the men. I do not think there is a woman in the  Church that opposed it inmore than I did in my feelings  How many wives have you Mr Greely. G ownly one  H. C. K. How many Misses do you keep. G Not any.  B Y I do not think their is a member of the Church in this   room that has had any connexion with a woman except his  wife if Mr Greely can say as much, then I think you are   virtuous. (He did not answer it) G. I would like to visit   your schools while here do you have free schools do the  Church pay for the schooling of all the children Y No all  pay their own schooling at present. G I hear that the   Church is rich. Y The Church have some buildings here  G While Journeying here it was reported that the animals  of the emigrating trains belonged to the Church. Y The[y] are  not Church animals they belong to members of the Church  probably. G. Were not the leaders of the Church poor you  say you have no salary. you seem to be wealthy I do not see  how you get your property B. Y. I gathered some property  in kirtland. I earned it with my hands except half   of a pig which weighed 90 lbs which Joseph Gave me we  had to leave kirtland through persecution I came to  Nauvoo with nothing I there got a property through  my labor & the Blessings of God. We were driven from   our property there & I had to Borrow to get here & now   my Property I suppose is worth some three hundred thou-  sand dollars and you may ask any man in heaven  Earth or Hell, if I have wronged him out of a dollar     
 July 13  and if you can find such a man I will make it right  I have wronged No man I have paid for what I have  had as I have said I do not have as much as an ear of  corn out of the tithing office ownly what I pay for I Borrowed  money to help the poor when I came here and I want  you to write my statement as I give it for it is true as   the Son. I financeer my affairs according to the wisdom   God has given me & I trust to him & he alone gives  me my increase. there isare fears here that there will  not any potatoes grow I shall look for potatoes when it  is time to dig them I do so with all my business the  Lord kan make me rich or poor Just as he pleases  I care not a groat for all the gold & silver in the world  and Jesus Christ did not. G. The leaders of the Church  must have some advantage the city lots here sold for some  price did it not go to the leaders of the Church. Y No all   the setlers paid for their city lots was $1.50 $1 to the   surveyor Mr Sherwood & 50 cts to Thomas Bullock the  recorder. G How do you get farmes here. Y The  land belongs to the United States and all the claim setlers  have is possession and improvements when men take   up unsurveyed lands they pay the surveyors fees & when  they buy improvements they pay for them according  to there value. & what they produce all men like to   speculate more or less & men are apt to get what they  can. G I calculate that I am about the ownly man  who speculates who has not bought some land in the wes-  tern country, or a city lot, many who have speculated  in land have become poor.      You have had two or three  split off's. How do you consider them. Y. The same as  all apostates. G Do the Bishops make Bishops or how is it  done. Y The people meet in conference and if they want  a man to preside over them as a Bishop they vote for him  and he is ordained a Bishop to preside over them.  G Can the people reduce a Bishop to the layity Y. The  people can remove a Bishop from presiding over them by   a vote & chuse the one they wish. G who is the President  of the Church. Y you know that I am the President  of the Church. I have my two councellors Mr Kimball  & Wells here are my councellors. Then we have Twelve  Apostles & Seventies & various Quorums in our organizat-  ion G My neighbors religion does not trouble me any  how & I see no particular harm in your religion and  I am glad to learn so much from you about the rule  management, & organization of your Church I now   [k]now much more about your Church than I ever have  before. How many clergy men of other sects have Joined  your Church. Y not a great many & they are not often  worth much when they do Join. For the clergy men  Doctors & Lawyiers make about as poor Saints as any class   of men we have for they do not like to work much & the   mormons work for a living and I believe I am about  the ownly man who does not work. G I think there     
 July 13  is not many Editors come among you by the looks of the  papers published here. Y No and if they should we should   be careful not to Employ them to publish for us      G I think it would be a good plan to sow the Canida thistle  all over the sage plains & deserts it would renevate the   soil & make food for cattle. Y if that is your opinion  pray dont tell the people of it for you could not introduce  a worse plague if the people was ^to^ introduce Canida Thistles  it would come Nearer to driving out the mormons from the   country than any elsthing els. they would ruin any country  G O I think they would be a great Benefit & if they got  into your grass & farming land you can eisily kill them by  mowing & salting them. Y I think not. G I think the  Army was sent here esspecially for your Benefit & the  Benefit of Wardle & Russel, you are getting rich through   the army. Y The people are making money from that source  they introduce money, cattle, waggons Horses & Mules.   The people buy the waggons for the Irons for $15 or $20   of the largest class, containing some 6 or 800 lbs which  is quite a help to the country where Irons is scearce G.  The whole country is lined with Iron. there is many   miles of chains & if I lived in the country I would pick  it up & cash it. Y The Government would claim it  G I would give them so many days Notice then to take   it out of the way & if they did not do it I would take  it myself. There is more good timber in one of those  large freight waggons than grows in this whole Territory  I dont believe in your having a Famine or that there  is going to be any Famine Y what do you refer to. G I   see it published in the Deseret News. Y. yes you refer to  Orson Hydes Famine sermon. G We had 2 frost in the  states & it was reported that evry thing was killed on   the 11th June in the North But I do not think that the  frosted district was vary extensive. [Y.] We are improving   evry year in agricultural, pursuits & when we get all the Dr  & Lawyiers to work we shall raise all you want. I dont  think we shall have any Famine. I have travelled through  many parts of Europe they are capable of raising much  food, I think Lombardy with its irrigation is the richest   part of Europe. [G.] Mr Young I shall have to state in my   report that I consider your system of poligamy is reducing  the female Here to the oriental state I see no chance for the  female here for her to develop herself, I see no Female signs  out in this city I see no chance for a woman ownly to be  a first or fifteenth wife. Y A woman here has all the   chance or liberty here to develop her talent or capabilities   of doing good & filling her sphere that she has in any country  But I do not want any woman to council & dictate me  in the direction of my affairs if I did I should think I   ought to have been made a woman G I dont care whether  a person is man or woman I think they should have the priv-  lege of Developing their Talent, it is well enough for a  woman to bear children But I think they ought to rule  when they are capable of it. Queen Elizabeth was the greatest     
 July 13  Ruler England Had And Catherine was one of the greatest   Sovreigns of Russia But Poligamy I think has a tendency to bury   up the talent of women H. C. K. is it worse to be a mans second  wife than to be a horewhore G I dont know that it is.      Here Mr Greely closed his interigations. Took his  hat Bowed to the company & retired      After Mr Greely left conversation turned upon the oppositi-  on of our enemies President Young said the Lord has said he   would fight our Battles & give us the victory & he has done it   thus Far. Should the Lord say now draw the sword & fight  many would cut their way through an Enemy & turn   around & fight over the spoil. this would gratify two many  evil hearts and that would not do President Kimball said  God holds Gov Cummings to do his will for us if He was to  leg go of him he would be our bitter Enemy      July 14, 1859 ~ Thursday      14th I spent the forepart of the day in the office the afternoon in   getting Hay      July 15, 1859 ~ Friday      15th I spent the day in the office in the after noon I called   upon President Young & red to him my report of his inter  view with Mr Greely. He was pleased with it, it met his  approbation. I also red it to D. H. Wells in the Historians  office [FIGURE] I wrote a Letter to G. A. Smith      July 16, 1859 ~ Saturday      16th I spent the day hoeing sugar cane & corn I attended  a meeting of the Typhographical Society at the Counceil House  Mr Horace Greely was present the meeting was got up for his  specil Benefit there was quite a room full of Brethren  & sisters, and a Band of music. after a few tunes by the   Band & a short Prayer By Gilbert Clements we herd   a speech from Mr Horace Greely & I must say that  I was entirely disappointed in the man I was asstonished   at his speech, &language, & appearance. he appeared far more  like a clown of the lowest grade than he did like a   man of letters, ability, & extensive influence & a   conducter of one of the most popular Journals in the Nation  I was at a losts to know whether he was playing the possum  or had lost his senses. He appeared to me like a man   who had accidentelly stumbled into notiriety popularity  & wealth,. for neither his head, Phisiognomy, looks,   acts, or speech indicated indicated in the least a man   of knowledge, refinement talent, influence or ability   sufficient to edit a Tribune his speech was reported by  G. D. Watt I did not take minutes it is true there was   some sense in what He said but the language he used  & his manner of speaking nearly destroyed all interest  in the sentiments advanced. He commencd in a whine-  ing drawing out of his words in a vary flat manner in   a babiyish stile as though he had neither a knowledge of   language or Grammar while at the same time we must  be fully aware that he is vary proficient in both for   He has Edited & conducted the Tribune the most popular  & widest circulated paper in America for more than     
 16  thirty years. He commenced by saying Mr President Gent-  lemen & Ladies I am happy to meet with you here to night  esspecially to see so many females I havent seen a woman  before since I have come into this ere place not that belong to  this people & I dident expect to see one while I was here  well I do declair I am glad to see so many women here   to night I thought I was ownly going to meet a few poor   printers. I dident expect to see any women at all But I   expect you are connected in the printing business in some   way or other. The printers talked of gitting me up a dinner  well I decair I thought it was to hot to Eat dinners  much I could get along without any dinner & with   but a poor Breakfast if I could ownly in the morning   take up a News paper & read what all the world had   done the day before & gess what they would do today  I could get along with the loss of all the luxeries that   you are deprived of if I could have a telegraph wire   that would tell me all that was going on in all the world  He confined his speech to the printing business telegraph  wire & the improvements of the day told how long he had   been in the printing business the improvements that had been  made in that art since He commenced He know had a stea[m]  press that could print 20000 sheets per hour & should not  be satisfied untill he could put on one ton of paper in one   continues rooll onto his cilender & print 40000 sheets per hour   & fold, cut, & direct them by steam which improvement   he was sure would soon come in use He was followed by  Elder O Hyde who spoke upon a variety of subjects & belie-  ved in a telegraph wire which would reach from heaven  to Earth so we could get revelation of God from heaven &  other world. Elder John Taylor followed & spoke of many   things & of the conduct of the Judges in this Territory  Gilbert Clements spoke also John Banks. James MCknight   red to Mr Greely a poem from Mr. Lions welcomeing  Mr Greely He flourished a candle with such velosity  around Mr Greely's head that I think he left a sprink-  ling of spearm upon his close Brother Dunbar sun a   song Brother Mabyan sung a song about the man that could   never get warm and at 11 oclok they adjourned to the  Globe to take Ice Cream &c but I returned home & did   not attend.

I met   with the Twelve in the evening John Taylor prayed &   Erastus Snow was mouth we conversed upon a variety   of subjects Brother Benson gave an account of Mr Greely  going into a store to buy a neck tie which was quite amusing

M. Blair Chairman   & A Carrington Secretary. The meeting resolved to  Drop the name of Horrace S. Eldridge & insert in its stead   the Name of William H.

Richards   & Joseph A Young start early in the morning for  all the southern settlements & distribute the circulars  as far as the lowest settlements also that John Taylor   & oOrson Hyde go South North as far as Box Elder & Cach  valley for the same purpose President Young wrote a letter  I left the office at about 1 oclok at Night it was supposed   that the Gentiles would try to vote at Camp Floyd & get  the armey to vote.

 Oct 26  can tell it was not any fear of death but a visita-  tion of the most ^damnable^ vampyres to torment both body   and spirit that could be congured up eithe^r^ real   or imaginary.

"It has been said that  Buchanan was in his dotage & feeble in mind which was  the cause of his course towards Utah & many other acts of  his Administration but this is not the case, he is just as  much of a man now as he ever was in his life and it was  the first time He ever was in a situation to fully carry  out the evil designs of his heart, and his acts are carrying  out his principles. E R Young said that the Judges in this  Territory would not have taken the course they did if they  had not Believed the President would have sustained them   in it.

President Young said in speaking  of the Temple we I herd a man say to day we would go back   to Jackson County in 7 years I said Amen but if we go back   in that time we shall have to hasten to get our temple Built  I chink we must commence it next spring, uncover the  foundadtion But I shall have to take up one tier of rock  all over the foundation, For Brother Raleigh appears as though  he wished to destroy that Temple He would not take Brother   Angels levil which He had got up with great care and  he would not trust to his own Judgment but got Brother Fox  to help him get the levil. But Raleigh made one himself  and he made the foundation not levil & in order to levil up  the last tier he put under small stones which would all crush-  edbeneath the building and one quarter of an inch setling of  that Building would crack it from top to Bottom I have  had much trouble with masons upon this subject, and it   is strange to see this spirit manifest among our leading masons  I should be glad to see the day when all men who profess to  be saints will impart what knowledge they possess to  each other I do not know as Brother Raliagh realizes what He  is doing but it appears to me that He is trying to destroy the  Architecture of that Building.

We are istanding in   the midst of a Generation which is full of interesting   Events, we are approaching Revolutions & changes which   will shake Kingdoms, Thrones & Republics, from the Earth  to circumference and lay them in the dust and open the  way for the Esstablishment of the kingdom of God and  of more freedom and liberty than now Exists upon Earth  The signs of the times show that 1860 may be the  commencement of the desolution of the American Union  and of Bloody European wars But the Lord will guide   the destiny of ^the^ world in such a manner that his will   will ofbe done and the Prophets Fulfilled      I spent the fore part of the day in the office in reading   & conversation with G.

H. Wells read the peace in  the Mormon on the Murder of Strang & expulsion of that people      President Young said I have got a Letter from Elder   Hyde. He officiated as Clerk in Drummonds Court &   wrote things there day after Day against God our religion & the   people for a few dimes. He ought to be cut off from the  Quorum of the Twelve & the Church He is no more fit to stand   at the Head of the Quorum of the Twelve than a dog His soul is  entirely occupied with a few dimes & it is much more in his  eyes than God Heaven & Eternal Life.

Now Brother   Taylor you go & get your hands & go to that dam & build that & do  it well do not trust to any man to boss that Job who is not well   aquainted with the business. Now I want to give you some council   & instruction abut this Job get you a Gang of Hands & say to   them now I will give you so much interest for doing so much  on this canal.

 Consequence of some who were in Authority not obeying Council   but rather blocked up the way. An the Afternoon President J. M. Grant  & H. C. Kimball & L. W. Hardy all spoke in the power of God & in  the demonstration of the Holy Ghost, they reproved, rebuked, exhorted  in the power of God accompanied with prophesying      I Attended the prayer Circle. President B Young was present He was  unwell & did not attend meeting through the day. The subject came   up concerning the Emigration starting so late that it had   ICost this Territory more than it would to have bought oxen  & brought them through for we have had to send some   250 teams out to meet the Emigration & send some  20 Tons of flour & many thousands of Dollars worth   of shoes & clothing. President Young asked why they were  so late Brother Richards said that Elder Taylor wanted to   controll the Emigration & means & would not take hold &  assist in the work without it President Young said Brother Young   Taylor was a good man in many things but he was not  fit to handle means I no more than a child I am going to  inform Taall churches people & agents next season who do   not take my council that they shall be suspended from the  Church. Elder Taylor said that they could not be forwarded  short of £12 $58 which would not do at all President  Young said you had your positive instructions what to do  but John Taylor stood in your way & you did not do as you  were told & then people were sent so late that it has cost   us many thousands of Dollars to get them in now what  did you think of isuch things. Elder Franklin Richards  said the ownly excuse I have to offer is that Orson Spencer   was dead & John Taylor took charge of all things in the states   & informed me that he had instructions from President   Young to attend to it which it appears was not correct  Elder Taylor wanted to handle the money himself which   was wrong      I went to the 12 ward & preached & had the spirit of God   upon me. I was followed by Bishop Hardy & several others who  spoke in the spirit of the Lord      October 27, 1856 ~ Monday      27th I spent most of the day preparing my waggon & team to go  into the mountain to assist the poor saints who are in the snow & on  the road with hand Carts I also put up a new boiler to day   to make Beet Molasses I met with President Grant & all the Mission-  aries at Brother F.

Now we want to know what all men  are doing through this Territory the people are dirty & filthy &  they want to reform in this thing. many do not treat their   children right but use them roughly now if a man has the spirit  of God he will use his Children well & treat them kindly  I can tell you that Children are very sensitive & the treatment   they meet with has a great Effect upon them we want to  see to that the people are imployed the reason why we prosper in   this City more than any other we labour.

 from us we felt his loss deeply for two months it seems as though he had been   hurried to close up his work He has been preaching for several months calling  upon the people to repent his voice has been like the Trump of the Angel of   God & he has laboured night & day untill He was laid prostrate with sickness   He has shot the arrows of the Almighty with great power among the people.   He Called at the Historians office on the 19th Nov the last time He was out. He   was then sick. He was confined to his house 10 days before he died He had   a great vision while He was sick which he told to the brethren he preached   nearly all the time that He was sick & he related all that he saw in the spirit   world      Soon after I entered his house his wife Rosetta was seized with   great trembling & nervous excitement & it seemed as though her frame would shake   to peices we lade hands upon her & rebuked the Devil which seemed to sieze her   tabernacle & she became more calm.

Sister Zina Young walked with me to President Grants & spent  the day with the sisters in makeing the robes. I felt sick & went home & went   to bed & was sick through the day. Leo Hawkins started for Filmore today      December 3, 1856 ~ Wednesday      3rd I spent most of the day writing the Obituary of J. M. Grant      December 4, 1856 ~ Thursday      3rd4th [FIGURES] At 9 oclok preperations were made for the Funeral of J. M. Grant  The doors of the House was flung open for the people to visit the corps many   thousands went through the House to visit the body at half past 9 the Military   began to form in open lines from the residence to the Tabernacle 3 bands of   Music were in attendance. The Lieutenant General & staff, General Grant staff &   Lancers were in attendance & a company of York masons formed in the posse   procession the corps was removed to the tabernacle & the House filled up   & many that could not get in. But it took so long to get through   with the ceremonies of the Morning that it was 10 minuts to 12 oclok when   President Brigham Young arose to speak as it was so late He did not   speak but a short time & said He did not answered his mind but his   remarks were vary interesting & instructive at the close of the meeting   the procession was formed & the corps conveyed to the grave followed   by the largest procession ever formed on such an occasion in this   valley. at the Grave President Young made some remarks He said   we have no cause to mourn for Brother Grant and you have made   a far greater display here than was necessary for more so than   Brother Grant would have wished & a far greater display than   I wish you to make over my body when I die Brother Grant   is well off & He has lived more in advancement & far riper for   Eternity in 40 years than many would in a Hundred when I die   I ownly want you to let my body rest in the grave I want to be buried decently   but I do not wish any great Display at my funeral let your flags lie still   & all your military display. I hope the body of Brother Grant may lie here   undisturbed thill till the resurrection I see the warm feelings of the   people for Brother Grant. it is cold let the people go home & let the bearers stay   & see the grave filled up properly. The procession then returned to the House   during the evening I called upon Brother Grants family I then attended   meeting in the 14th ward. I was some unwell. I spoke a short time     
 December 5, 1856 ~ Friday      5th I spent most of the day at home I was unwell      December 6, 1856 ~ Saturday      6th I spent the fore part of the day in the office I attended meeting of   the Bishop & council & priesthood of the 14th ward at 2 oclock F. D. Richards  was present. I sat & herd the report of the Bretheren & when I   [FIGURE] was requested to speak by Bishop Hoagland I arose & said   that as Bishop Hoagland & the missionaries had appointed   Men as teachers to the gentile stores to preach the gospel to them   But the spirit said to me it was not wisdom to send men to preach   the gospel to them I considered they were wicked & corrupt &   it was like casting pearls before swine when I closed F. D. Richards   Backed me & up & bore testimony that I said was true. Then Bishop   Hoagland arose & opposed me vary strongly & said He presided over the   14 ward & had sent the Teachers to preach to the Gentiles & he wished   them to go & do it I at once saw the gentiles were devil had ensnared   him when He sat down the Teacher arose & said what shall I   do Brother Woodruff says do not go to those Gentiles Bishop Hoagland   says go. I arose & said to the teachers obey your Bishop for He  says he will take the responsibility upon himself in sending teachers   to them many of the Priesthood were fired up upon the subject   but the meeting closed & we went home At about 5 oclok the   Calafornia mail came in & Brother Richards & myself went up   to Presidents Youngs we related to him what had taken place with  us & Bishop Hoagland President Young was asstonished at the position   which Brother Hoagland had taken He said the devil was leading   him into dificulty which he could not extricate himself without   Help. He immediately sent for Bishop Hoagland who came up & the   subject was all talked over & President Young showed him his   Error & he saw it President Young told him that the Twelve  held the keys of the Kingdom of God in all the world where   the presidency are not, & that No Bishop presided over any   one of the Twelve in any place the Bishop Made his confession   and went home we santt a while & read Letters & papers      several were received from Elder Hyde      December 7, 1856 ~ Sunday      7th Sunday I attended meeting in the Tabernacle Edward Martin  & Daniel Tyler Preached in the forenoon & C. G. Webb & Wm   Clough Preached in the afternoon I Attended the prayer   Circle. Heard the Letters read from Elders Hyde & others   Elder Orson Hyde calls for 100 more men thinks there will be   a prospect of a fight with the Calafornians. President Young   said He wished all the men were at home & that Elder Hyde   was at home in his store & that He would not take any   Mission while he lived for He had lost the spirit of his   office & was of no account. It made the President feel   sorrowful to see the Twelve & others not feel the spirit of their   office. At the close of the meeting I went home & with my   family went to the 14 ward meeting in the Music Hall I was   much pressed in spirit. After listening to the speeches of Brothers   Hunt, Candland, & Pack I was requested to speak I arose upon my   Feet though heavily pressed in spirit yet the spirit of God was in  my tabernacle like fire shut up in my bones and I spoke to the people   [FIGURE] about 3/4 of an hour and I scearsly knew whether I was in the body   or out of [it] neither can I remember but little what I said, the following   is are some of the remarks which I made while the House was as still as   the House of Death while the spirit of God filled the House.     
 Brethren & sisters I arise to say a few words to you But I am pressed in spirit   & I can say as I have heard Brother Joseph say while smiteing upon his   breast I would to God I could unbosom my feelings in the house of my friends,   but I do not expect to do it but in a small degree for my mind is open in   vision of things which I cannot utter or speak unto you for it is not   lawful or expedient if I had the ability to do so. I am pained in spirit as I   see the Bishop & council & teachers & missionaries labouring, toiling, rebuking &   pounding the people trying to removeing the darkness & fog which hangs   over this City & the 14th ward. But let me say to the Bishop & teachers & missio  naries before me to night to go to work & search deeply your own hearts & get   the spirit of the living God upon you remove the fog & darkness from your   own minds & then you can see clearly to remove the darkness from the minds   of the people. The priesthood need the spirit of God in order to know how to deal   with the people & save them for when you knock the people in the Head in order  to wake them, when they get awake you should not still pound them untill you   kill them. but get a Fatherly feeling & try to save them. Some of the teachers   when they go through the ward to teach the people they get the big head &   do not know ^how^ to treat the people. it is not nessary to stand here & jump   & shout & stomp off 50 cts worth of sole leather in order to get the people   to wake up or reform but it is a straight forward business matter to reform   whare any one has stolen or done wrong in any thing let them return what   they have taken & make restitution. It is a momentious time in Israel &  it is necessary for this refermation in order to have the people prepared for the   great things of God which are comeing upon the Earth & upon this people   the line will be drawn & scenes will take place which will try mens   souls & I warn all men & women before me this night that they do not   make light of the things of the Kingdom of God or of this refermation   for destruction is nigh the doors of such as do it & I warn our young   Brethren & Sisters that they humble themselves before God & give heed to the   words of Eternal Life listen to the council of the Bishop & Missionaries &   teachers among you for if you despise the council of God & his servants   judgment will come upon you & destress & anguish will be upon you. The   Lord is calling loudly upon this people to repent & do the works of righteousness   & Live your religin remember the Testimony of Brother Grant the testator   is dead but the testiment is in force his hard labours to awaken this   people have cost him his life He has laid down his body in the grave   I made many other remarks while the fire & power of the Holy Ghost   was burning within me. At the close of the meeting I called the Bishop   & priesthood to gether & gave them instruction concerning the wrong cours   Bishop Hoagland had taken with me I taught them the order of the   Priesthood Bishop Hoagland was humble & made all necessary satisfaction      December 8, 1856 ~ Monday      8th I spent most of the day in the office at night I attended the   meeting of the Missionaries & Bishops. Presidents Young & Kimball were   present also W. Woodruff & F D Richards of the Twelve       W Woodruff arose & called the Names of the Bishops & Missionaries most   of which answered to their names. F. D. Richards opened By Prayer & singing  W. Woodruff arose & said I feel as though I want to say a few word  it has seemed good unto the Lord to call a portion of us through   the mouth of his servants to go forth unto the inhabitants of this   City to preach the gospel of salvation & repentance unto the people, we   have met each week to give a report of our procedings but  have not here to fore been associated with the Bishops in our meeting   I stand connected with you as a missionary & realize that those   who have assembled here this evening should stand as the candle &   light of the Lord. I have never felt more responsibility resting     
 upon me than at present God has an object in sending us to preach   the gospel of Repentance to the people & so had the servants of the Lord who   sent us forth. I feel that it is necessary to purify ourselves & get   the spirit of God before we can properly go forth to preach to the people   if we will get the darkness & fog from ourselves we can take it   From the people & the Elements will be Clear. I feel to purify myself I   have felt the spirit of God resting upon me of Late & I feel that there   is great things awaiting us. The Presidency of this church has   had the Head Heart & soul ake for a long time it has   caused their hearts to ake to see the Apostles & Elders of this church   who bear the priesthood forget their calling & turn from the work   of God unto Folly & have their hearts set upon the things of the world  we may use the sledge hammer to much but we should be right   ourselves when we reprove others. The Bishops & Missionaries in   some instances have manifested a feelings for the mastery to know   who should be the greatest but they would not have this feeling if   they had the spirit of God. The Business of the Missionaries is   to call upon the people to repent & live their religion & the Bishops  should unite with them in the spirit of God to carry out this Great   work. How Long shall we see the Presidency of this Church weighed   down to the Earth with a Burthen which the Elders & people should   bear. Aris up ye Bishops & missionaries & put on the whole armor   of God & the people will live their religion when you live it yours   yourselves then the burthen will begin to lighten upon the presidency   some time when we sharply rebuke the people we are not right ourselves  thies things are true. It is time we arose in the spirit & power   of our calling & help bear the burthen that is resting upon the shoulders   of Presidents Young & Kimball. No man could live with the   Load resting upon him that is now upon the head of those men   unless he was nerved up & sustained Daily by the hand & power   of God. I feel brethren that there is sumthing important awaiting   us. The more I humble myself before God & get the Holy Ghost the   more my heart is drawn out towards the presidency of this   Church I have never seen the day in my life when I have   felt to prize the society & council of those men as I do at the   present time, this people have not prized them & their teaching   as they ought & if they do not more appreciate their labour   & keep their council better than they have done they will   be taken from us. Brethren lay aside all your selfish feelings   & you will see that God will be with us let us wake up ourselves   & then the people not for this winter ownly but let the refermation   last during our lives. Presidents Young & Kimball are present   & I would like to hear them teach & council us this evening but   I presume they feel as though they had taught us so long & so much   which we have not improved upon that they feel discouraged in  teaching us, & think we ought to know how to walk aright But   I do not wish to occupy your time the spirit says I should close   May God Bless you Amen       President Young sung "O Happy souls who pray" then said   Brother Woodruff has given us a good testimony a Living testimony   in the spirit & power of the Holy Ghost. Now any of the rest of   you who have the Holy Ghost arise & speak to us those things which   will Edify. B. L. Clapp & E. D. Woolley then spoke a Few moments   then President Young arose & spoke to the people the following   is a synopsis of his remarks as I reported them all Brother Kimball     
 President Young arose & said. I dont expet to speak much to night   I have learned to governed myself in talking as well as in other things   it may be asked if this is a new work it is not a new work but our   refermation is the work we begun in when we embraced the gospel. I   have pointed out the Errors of the people all the time & shown the people ther   faults & told them what to do but here is the difficulty as soon as the Elders   come home from their missions in a few days they lay down their Armour   while they should keep oit on all the time & keep it bright but their minds   are engrossed with the things of the world & lie down & go to sleep their ownly   ambition is to know how they can get this House built or a farm, Horses   cattle &c, their whole soul is in the work of the world not the building of   the Kingdom of God but any man that gets property upon this principle   it will carode him he has not wisdom to use it. I have told the people   a hundred times they do not know how to get rich. The way for the   people to get rich is to do the will of God & they must be governed by the   Revelations & spirit of God. Brother Woodruff has told us here to night   how it is when I look upon the conduct of the people before the refer  mations commenced as I was teaching them the way of salvation daily   & they would not give heed to it pained my heart & I felt as if I   should die but when Brother Jedediah M Grant steped forward   & took the Burthen off from me I was relieved But it has cost   him his life Had he not have taken that burthen upon him he would   have lived a few Years longer in our midst. I have felt that unless   this people would awake & live their religion I must go down to   the grave But the burthen of this people was taken from me & rested   upon him & it has not yet returned to me although he is dead should   it return to me as it has been I shall soon follow him to the grave   for I could not live long with that wait upon me. When you first   recieved the gospel did ^was^ not your heart filled with love & you put on  the gospels armour & would it not have continued with you all the time  if you had lived your religion all the time but you have had bad   feelings in your Breast & against your Neighbour but if the spirit of   God had continued with you it would have overcome those evil   feelings and what if we were all to put our armour off & partook   of the spirit of anger & Hatred God would spue us out of his mouth   & we would go down to hell together & He would raise up another   people to do his will. After all the stuper that has rested upon this   people they have been gaping for more revelation I do not mean one   man but I mean the whole people while they have already a great deal   more than they are worthy off & if this people do not wake up &   live their religion The Lord will take away the sources of revelation   which they now have from the people, it is not a few men that have   got to live their religion but it is this whole community. If we as   a people will return unto the Lord I know he will receive us with   open arms. I am glad that this winter has commenced without   Fidling & danceing. But would their be any harm in going into the   Hall & haveing a dance if we felt right & kept the spirit of God with   us, No there would not. But as soon as we should open this door   how many would keep the armour on & live their religion & keep   the spirit of God not many, some would but many would say come   let us go & take a drink & begin to get the liquor in them & then they would   say come Brother Brigham I am ready for any thing stand out   of the way here Hurrah for Hell sware a little Dam a little steal a   little gamble a little, & raise the Devil. But we will stop Fidling &   danceing untill the Brethren get power to overcome these things & keep   them under their feet. I do not intend to start danceing again untill the     
 people will learn to do right, & live their religion. I have to war with the   weakness of man I am incompassed with it, I know what it is to fight it all the  time. If you are going to continue a refermation make up your mind   to live your religion. If the people will do this it will be as Brother Woodruff   says the darkness will pass away & I can live long among this people &   so can brother Kimball & other men But if this people will go on lieing   stealing swearing & whoreing I do not want to live but I want to leave   the people & go to God & let the wicked go to Hell I hope that God will  send the wicked that will not repent ^go^ down to hell quickly & be burned up   that they may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. When I first came into   this church I was an Enthusiast & thought I would never keep an account   never put pen to paper nor never say this or that was mine but it is the   Lords we never can be of one heart & one mind untill we can say that all   we have is the Lords & that we are ^ownly^ his servants & stewards to controll it accord[ing]  to his will. When the Lord gives me property He gives me wisdom to use it.      We have individual rights & shall have to all Eternity. what are those rights   If I have any property Horses Cattle waggons or any thing Els my neighbor   has no right to stell it from me. and if the people have the spirit of the   Lord they would know that it was not right to take any thing which belonged   to another without liberty but let it remain whare it is. we are accounting   for our time to the Lord now if you have a months leasure time & you gamble  that away & do not bring to pass any good you might just as well throw   away $20 and you are accountable for this waste of time. I am often   asstonished at the folly of this people many women are asking their   husbands for some new thing they want a dozen new Dresses & many   unnecessary things but does a person want of Doz new Dresses if this   people would ask for those things which are necessary & do right you would   soon see the people get rich. but what are you doing? are you rich No. the   Lord can send the grasshoppers Crickets & Locust they are his Armies & can   Eat us up and kill our Cattle He can give us much or little as He pleases   If our eyes are single to the glory of God & we do our duty the Lord   could make us as rich as Cesar what would do with it aggrandize   yourselves, no you should not, but send out millions of men to gather   the poor & send men with mules loaded with gold to buy the Nations   but now we are poor & we can comparitively do but little. Now I am here with   Brother Kimball If you wish to ask any question we can answer right but   for me to teach the Bishops there duty it is folly for I have taught them   over & over for years. Now if I was going to a ward meeting to preach   and the bishop was to oppose me unless it was my duty to reprove him I   should sit & laugh at him but not contend with him. But when their is any   difficulty between a missionary & Bishop or any two men they should not   contend about it before the people but talk it over among themselves   & settle all diference of opinion in the spirit of God & not labour for   the mastery      President H. C. Kimball followed & said I am one with President   Young & so was J. M. Grant He to[o]k hold of the work to wake up the people   with all his might & it killed him. If President Young was to ask me   to go forth in the safme way I would do it but it would cut short my   life as it did his. I have never felt as though Jedediah was dead   the saviour said those that abide in me will never die his spirit is   with us & he can do more for us now than he could before. The spirit of God  is poured out upon some men mightily. The refermation is doing good   & the people are doing better & those who get the spirit of God will stand   & those who do not will fall. The people are forsaking their sins

I hope there will be nothing said about it in the Legislator  at all. They want us to pay taxes & next they will want us to send   a thousand men to the war. What will they do about the taxes the people   have not the money they would have to take wheat & Lumber & such   things as the people have if they get any thing but they will not collect   the taxes Here neither will they get 1000 men to go into the Armey they   would spend one million of Dollars by sending an armey here to collect  thirty thousand dollars taxes they have sought our Destruction all the day   long why do they not pay othere own debts they destroyed there army     
 1861  and amuniction at Camp Floyd so that we should not get any of  it when the government is owing Utah there Quota of arms I will  se them in Hell before I will raise an army for them. Abe Lincoln  has sent these men her to prepare the way for an Army An order  has ben sent to Calafornia to raise an army to come to Utah this   is the reason why Bell came back. I pray daily that the Lord will take   away the reigns of Government of the wicked rulers & put it into the Hands  of wife [wise] good [men]. I will see the day when those wicked rulers wiped out the  Governor quoted my sayings about the Constitution I do and always  have supported the Constitution but I am not in league with such  cursed scoundrels as Abe Lincoln and his Minions they have   sought our destruction from the Begining & Abe Lincoln has ordered  an army to this Territory from Calafornia & that order passed  over on these wires. A, senator from Calafornia said in Washington  a short time since that the Mormons was in there way & must be  removed. The feelings of Abe Lincoln is that Buchannan tried  to destroyed the mormons & could not, now I will try my hand at   it.

Orson Hyde Preached upon the subject of   the Revelations of St John spoke of the Book sealed with seven seals, the  opening of the seals, the Blowing of the trumps, and pouring out of the plagues  upon the wicked. He was followed By President Young who said the  Book that John sayw in the Hands of the angel was the Book containing   the record of the Events of the children of men upon this Earth  the scribes keep a record in Heaven of the acts of men as they trans-  pire upon the Earth & they will be Judged out of the Books. The Beasts  there spoken of By John were actual Beasts that were raised from  the dead A true Prophet speaks of things which are true they do not  prophesy falsly. "we shall see the Judgments of God poured out  upon the wicked untill it will make us weep He said many interesting     
 1861  things and the spirit & power of God was upon him. ErastusLorenzo Snow  spoke in the afternoon also Elder Hyde. The Twelve met at the  Historians office for Prayer President Young met with us  F. D. Richards Prayed Lorenzo Snow was mouth at the close President  [FIGURE] Young said he had received over Eleven thousand dollars in gold  for the telegraph polls which he had set up, or delivered on the lines  He said I did not tuch that gold with my fingers or flesh untill it was   all paid in. I then put it in a vessel of water & clensed it and   said what words I wished over it I then delivered evry dime of   it over for tithing I have not used one farthing of it for my own   use. this is what I have done knowone knows any thing about it Except  my clerks and I dont want you to say any thing about it.      It has been said that we have sold tithing wheat to the armey we   have done no such thing. Ferrymore Little made a contract to let them   have some wheat. We loaned him some wheat, to Fill that contract which  he has paid. Again Mr Bell made us a proposal that if we would  deliver our southern wheat at Camp Floyed He would deliver as  much at the Tithing office so Brother Sharp left his loads of wheat  there & Bell left the same amount at the tithing office for us you can   tell the people this & let them understand how it is. We then went  below into the Historians office when G. A. Smith presented to the  President an Act to provide for calling a convention. President  Young said that is right and let the convention ask the General   Government to admid us as a state and if they dont do it tell   them that we will organize a state government and controll  if we do not do sumthing to head this military operation  they will afflict us the whole country will soon be a mil-  itary despotism. we must soon take care of ourselves we must  soon organize a government for ourselves and take care of   ourselves.

He tought us the importance of our doing right & living   the Law of Life that we might be strong & healthy & have healthy  children and that Mothers should be prudent for the Benefit   of there osprings. George Symns spoke in the afternoon  President Young & Wells called in the evening & several of  the Twelve & spent a short time we then spent the Evening   at President Youngs office      December 23 1861 ~ Monday      23rd I spent the afternoon in the Legislature in the Evening the  committees on Revenue met at the Historians Office also President   Young & Wells we had a corcus [caucus] to take into consideration the  subject of the welfare of the inhabitats of Utah. We read  the long Law upon the direct tax and discussed that subject  President Young said in speaking of Govornor Dawson you   take a man like him who has been an Editor for 15 years and   you will find him to be a Jackass. He told the story of Brockass  On the steamer going down the river. The Homestead Bill  was spoken of. President Young said the Lord will soon pass  a Homestead Bill. you need not look for the Nation to do much  for us. H Stout was of the opinion that the Legislature had not   the power to make laws disposing of Lands & improvements  E. T. Benson, & Orson Hyde made short speeches. President Young  followed & said you want to go to & call a convention we want  to get up a state government. I believe as I live that that  we should organize a State Government and let it go into  Effect by the 15th March & I have faith to believe that God will  sustain us. This is a secret corcus & I dont want it known  what is done here. I can say this about forming a State Gover-  nment I Believe that Abel Lincoln does intend to bring destruction     
 Dec 23rd 1861  Upon this people if he can and has the power. I want to say  one word with regard to assuming this diret tax I think we had  better let the Government appoint there own officers & collect  there own tax, for I am satisfied that a Legal & Lawful assesor   & collecter cannot be found in this Territory according to this law  for there is not a Free holder in this Territory      December 24, 1861 ~ Tuesday      24 I spent a part of the day in the Legislature the Afternoon I met  [FIGURE] in the New Hall in the 14 ward at 10 oclok for the purpose of dedica-  ting the House. Mrs Woodruff with several others of the sisters  have been at work night and day almost for several days in making  the curtains & trimings for the windows and doors in order to get  it ready for the Dedication. Brother Edington took the supervis-  ion of the whole triming of the House. President Young arived  at about 11 oclok He called upon me to offer the Dedication   Prayer      The following Dedication Prayer was offered by W Woodruff      O God our Eternal Father we present ourselves before thee this  Morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to Dedicate this House  unto Thee, and we ask for thy Holy Spirit to bring all things to  our rememberance which may be nessacessary in the dedication  of this House. We dedicate the Foundation of this building together   with the ground upon which it stands that it may be Holy from   the commencement to the name of Most High. We dedicate the  Foundation with the rock Mortar and timbers and all things  appertaining thereto that it may be Holy unto the Lord. We dedicate  the walls of this House with the adobies, the mortar and every  tihing appertaining thereto that it may be Holy unto Thee. We  dedicate the door with the Joists boards and nails thereof that  the same may be Holy unto Thee. We also dedicate the windows  with the sash, glass putty and every thing pertaining thereto   also the curtains with the trimings ^thereof^ and the shades that  they may be Holy unto thee Lord. we dedicate the doors with  the Hinges screws locks, latches, and every thing pertaining  thereto that they may be Holy unto Thee the Lord our God. We  dedicate the Roof with the rafters, boards, shingles, lath, nails     
 Dec 24 1861  Plastering, cornice, ornamental work and all things   appertaining thereto that Evry thing may be Holy and consec-  rated unto Thee. We dedicate the stand the pulpit the seats the  floor the Boards the paint and evry thing belonging thereto  also the Benches and seats in this room that they may be Holy  unto the Lord. And we pray that this dedication, may   be acceptable, that this house and the ground whare on it stands  may be Holy unto Thee, and we ask that thy Blessings may rest   upon the Bishops and Priests and Elders who may occupy this   stand that they may be inspired to speak unto the Edifycation  of this people and that they may magnify the Holy Priesthood  given unto them. And we pray that this House may be clean  and every thing clean and pure which dwells therein  O God the Eternal Father we dedicate this House unto thee  and thy Kingdom for the purpose of Preaching, teaching,   instruction, singing & prayer, and for the teaching of Our   Children, and for Lawful and innocent recreation. we pray  that thy protecting care may be over this House, that it may be   protected from fire and winds, and Every Evil Element  And O God we pray that the spirit and power of darkness  may have no dominion here, That thy saints may inherit   this place in peace, that no Enemy may have power in   this House. And should the day Ever come that the Enemies  of thy Saints should have dominion in this Land grant that  this Building may be destroyed from the foundation and not  one stone left upon another that the wicked and unholy may   never inherit this House, nor this City nor any of the Houses  of thy Saints which have been dedicated unto thee Grant to accept  of this dedication we beseech of Thee that thy spirit may   rule and reign in this House, and may thy saints not worship  this House nor any thing appertaining to this Earth, But may  they worship the Lord of Hosts and help do thy will and  Esstablish thy kingdom upon the Earth. And if anything there  be pertaining to this Building or the ground upon which it stands that  we have not named before thee Grant that it may be Holy, that all things  pertaining thereto with the dedication thereof may be acceptable unto Thee   which we ask in the name of Jesus Christ our Redeemer Amen     
 Dec 24 1861  At the close of the Dedication Prayer President Young addressed   the saints the following are some of the remarks which he made  [FIGURE] He said as I have the privilege of speaking I hope I many be   actuated by the spirit of intelligence. As Brother Woodruff  has asked the Lord in his prayer so I feel to say amen to the whole   of it even to the destruction of the Buildings if our Enemies  ever had power to possess it. But I do mot think ewe shall   ever be driven from this inheritance I am satisfied we never  shall be if we live our religion & do our duty. Here we are  gathered together from all the Nations of the Earth, like the net   cast into the sea it gathers both good & bad and each one works   out what is in him. While Brother Woodruff was offering the   dedication Prayer I was wondering if they dedicated there   School Houses anciently. They dedicated Solomons Temple but   I dont know as they did there School Houses But we should  dedicate ourselves and all we have unto the Lord. We still have some   among us who still wish to mingle with the wicked they still  want to introdue Mr Devil to me & to this people and such wood   hender the progress of the kingdom of God. I am pleased to meet  with you here to day. I see the taste which you have displayed in  the finishing of this house which I like and admire. Pardon  me for quoting a remark of a man from the north in seeding  the 13 ward Assembly rooms proped up to keep them from  falling down. He said the glory of the Bishop of the 13 ward   had departed. But I hope the glory of the Bishop of the   14 ward will not depart as did the 13 ward I hope this   House will not fall down. I am pleased to see that you have  brought together the Elements which surround you and Erected   a Beautiful Hall which is a pleasure to meet in. Even the   most wicked take pleasure in beholding that which is beautiful   & lovely. I delight to meet here my soul is full of Blessings   for this people. we are living in a world of sin yet we are  approaching to the light and travelling together as Latter   Day Saints we should dedicate our all to God. The gospel of   Jesus Christ is to make good men better and to put them   in a position to receive Happiness Joy and glory to the fullness     
 Dec 24th 1861  of the capacity of man. Many Elders pray that they may   may have confidence in God. But I pray that I may live so  that God may have confidence in me I think it folly to pray  that I may have confidence in God for He is right all the   time and if we will live so that he may have confidence   in us we will do well. It is our duty to make all the   improvement we can while we live. All that we see here   on the Earth is a similitude of what is in heaven. we  have the Elements all around us to beautify & adorn zion   but we should not set our hearts upon Go[l]d or silver or   any thing upon Earth But sanctify the Lord in our Hearts   then we shall partake of Eternal life. I say to the 14 ward   if you occupy this House in the fear of God it will prove a   Blessing to you. In the time of the persecution in Missouri   we had to walk up & sign a Deed of trust to pay the  Expenses of the mob in driving out the saints they said   Jo Smith could not make the saints consecrate but we can   make them consecrate. The saints here complained of  paying a little tax and a little tithing money I dont know   but the Lord will let us pay a little money tax to the Devil the   Government requires a direct tax of some $27,000 dollars   When you have parties in this House dont admit drunken   men into it. another principle I wish to speak of if the   Bishop wishes to invite a Gentile in dont let the people complain  about it for when a Gentile comes in here and the priesthood   rules the Gentiles can do no hurt, But Let an Elder or  any latter Day Saints go & attend a party among the Gentiles   whare they reign and it is vary different that would be   rong. we should never bow down to the wicked we should never   descend but asscend & try to Elevate others to our standard       Men come here from the States & profess to be asstonished at   our History and improvements, and they come here Expecting  to accomplish that which they will not do. Most of the officers   which the Government have sent here are a Hiss and a By word   and a stink in the nostralls of all good men and there  never was a wickeder man than the President of the United States     
 Dec 24 1861  and so are his associates vary wicked men. I hop we will   strive to magnify our lives which God has given us, for we  shall either go on to life Everlasting, or descend to Everlasting   destruction. if we were all pure in heart as we should   be we would have pureower to hold our children & not bury   them as we now do. Now go to & dedicate your hearts &   your houses and all you have unto God. I feel to bless you   in the name of the Lord. we are in a world of sin, darkness   & temptation, and any man who will not be faithful to this  life how can He Expect to obtain Eternal Life. We have got  the kingdom of God Esstablish on the Earth and what   we cannot Buind to the kingdom of God we will let go.       President Young was followed by D. H. Wells & O Hyde they  both made many good remarks.      I spent the Afternoon in the Legislature and in the evening   I attended a party at the 14 ward School House the first   Held in the Hall      December 25, 1861 ~ Wednesday      25 [FIGURE] I spent the most of the Afternoon in the Legislature I attended   a Legislative Ball in the Social Hall about 20 Gentiles were   present we had supper & Paid $5 per couple      December 26, 1861 ~ Thursday      26 I spent the after noon in the Legislature we adjourned untill  the 3rd of Jan 1862      December 27, 1861 ~ Friday      27 I spent this day in the Endowment House we gave Endowments  to some 60 persons All the Presidency were present Brother   Wells sealed about 30 couple and I sealed 9 couple      December 28, 1861 ~ Saturday      28 I spent most of the day writing in the Journal in the office      December 29, 1861 ~ Sunday      29 Sunday I met with my Quorum in the Morning attended   Meeting at the Tabernacle all day Bishop Collester & G. D. Watt   Prayedeched & Isaac Laney & President Young in the afternoon  I attended meeting in the 14 ward assembly room we had a   full House I preached to the People followed by John Taylor   & F D. Richards & Bishop Hoagland      December 30, 1861 ~ Monday      30 I spent the day in the office writing in my Journal   I attended a Jordon Dam Meeting at the 17 ward school House      December 31, 1861 ~ Tuesday      31st I spent the day in the office looking over my Journal     
 Dec 31, 1861  This is the last day of 1861 which has past and gone   and borne its report to heaven of the deeds of all Nations   and men. This year has brought to pass much of the   fulfillment of the predictions of the Ancient and Modern  Prophets of God. See this Journal DecJan 31st 1861 I there   declaired as a Prophetic Historian that this year would   be the most distressing year America Ever sayw since they  were an independant Nation time has proven it so      Five States viz Missisippi, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana & Florida  seceded from from the Union in January the first month  of the year Texas seceded in Febuary. then followed North  Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Virginia, and A part of  Missouri have all seceded during 1861. This has brought  on a terrible war upon the Nation both North & South have  rushed to armes Untill the North alone has over six hundred  thousand men under arms and the South near the same  number of men. this war has cost the Northern States some  Five Hundred Millions of Dollars during the past year and many  thousands of lives and this is ownly the Begining of trouble  the close of 1862 will leave America with a debt upon  her shoulders of One Billion dollars a debt as large as the  debt of England. The state of Missouri whare the saints  have received there persecutions is now the great Battlefield  of the west. it is now man against man & neighbor against Neighbor  they who have spoiled the saints are now being spoiled  Independance, & Jackson County Missouri, is nearly destroyed  is is the case with many parts of the State. The Lord has  taken peace from the Earth and all Nations are still prepar-  ing for war. The Lord has pointed out the fate of this Nation  in the Book of Mormon and Doctrins & Covenants  He has said that when they became ripened in iniquity  they should be cut off, that day has come there cup  of iniquity is full, the whole Nation Rulers and people  are filled with corruption befor God And the presi-  dent & Senate of the United States are sending men  to Utah to rule over this people as a Govornor & Judges     
 1861  who are so corrupt that they are a Hiss & bye word and   a stink in the Norstrills of all people in the streets. John   W. Dawson was sent By President Lincoln to Utah as   there Governor He arived in Great Salt Lake City on the  7 of Dec. Delivered his miessage on the 10th to the Utah   Legislature and immediately commenced a scene of   debauchery and insulted women untill the widow of  Thomas Williams drove him out of her house with a fire  shovel because ^of^ his vulgar abuse to her, and He has left   this city for the East this day in the mail stage a disgraced   debauched Libertine, he left because He could not hold   Up his head in the streets and look the people in the face  because ohif his crimes. These are the kingd of Rulers the  Gentiles send to rule over Israel and Israel Begins to  Feel that it is time to rise up and appoint her own   Governors, Judges & Rulers & trust in God for the EResult   The American Nation as a United States Government is doomed   To destruction and No power can save it. They have forfeited  all right and title to Redemption or salvation at the Hand of  the Lord or his Saints it is decreed that the measure which they  have meeted out unto the saints shall be meetied unto them and   they are hastening unto there work of desolation, war, Bloodshed,   & destruction and wo, wo, is ther doom. The spirit of Prophecy  would cry O, Lord, Hasten thy work, let the wicked slay the wicked  untill the whole land is clensed from the corruption, sin,   abominations, and wickedness which now reigns upon the face  of the whole Earth. May thy Judgments continue to be poured  out upon this land of North America untill the Blood of Prophets   & Saints is avenged before the Lord and thy words fulfilled   upon the Land of Joseph. Take away the sceptre rule and  Government from the wicked & corrupt and give it into the   Hands of the Just even thy saints, that they may rule in  righteousness before thee. Give thy oppressed people O Lord  the privilege of appointing there own Governor, Judges, and  Rulers, from this time forth that thy Kingdom may be Esstab-  lished upon the Earth, and the poor rejoice in the Holy One of Israel

 WILFORD WOODRUFFS  JOURNAL  FOR  1862     
 January 1, 1862 ~ Wednesday      Jan 1st 1862  Jan 1st 1862 This is the commencement of another  New year in this momentous fast age 1860 & 61 have been   two vary important years in the History of the united States  but 1862 will be more so. The war will be more severe  the people will be more inspired to shed Blood, greater  Battles will be fought & more lives lost, and there will  be many destructions in the Land, the Lord will visit the  people with other Judgments besides war, great calamities  await the wicked this year. there will be wars in foreign  lands and a great ^want^ of Bread in the Earth ther will be  pestilence, tempests, floods Earth quaks and whirl winds  and Hail stormes which will destroy many of the lives   of men and the crops of the Earth, and the Lord will   continue to weaken this Nation untill they are broaken  to peasces and cast down to rise no more forever  The Lord has commenced a controvery with the   Gentiles upon this continent and He will never  scease untill they are broaken up & destroyed. The  Historian thiswill have much material for History during this  year. The foundation of the Temple has been Uncovered  and it is the intention to commence building it this  season. The Saints are also about to call a convention  to organize a State Government and there will be a   great gathering of the Saints and there will many things  transpire in fulfillment of the Ancient & Modern   Prophets. The Nations of the Earth grow more and   more wicked. Virtue righteousness & truth is hardly  known among men Except what is found among the  Latter Day Saints and they are persecuted by the Nation  because it Exists among them. This is a vary wicked  generation & the Earth groans under its abomination  and because of these things the Lord will pour out his  Judgments upon the inhabitants of the Earth untill the  Earth is clensed from the Abomination that Exhists &   the refuge of lies is swept away and the Earth prepared  for the coming of the LORD, who will Esstablish righteousness & truth     
 Jan 1st 1862  I spent most of the day in the office writing D. B. Huntington  called into the office and gave us the following report He said  that when the Govornor got up to Eaphraim Hanks when  Wood Reynolds had changed the Horses to go on as the  Govornor John W. Dawson came to get in Wood Reynolds  knocked Him down He ran into the House Reynolds follo-  wed him in & there beat him almost to death and drove  off & left him in his gore He done this because of his  insult to Mrs Williams also insulting the women at Ephrain  Hanks.

But they did not know that  they were inspired to do it there was a veil over them that   they did not know what the purposes of the Lord were or that  he was protecting them it is not so with us we know that  God is leading us and is inspiring his people to Esstablish  his Kingdom & Government upon the Earth & we know it  This convention was dismissed by prayer By H.

If I had called for volunteers on Sunday I could have   got 200 Names but this I did not wish to do I have been requested   many times to permit a settlement in that valley, But I have Never  wished to do it untill now But now I want a settlement there and I   wish to pick my company. The Gentiles will take possession of   that valley if we do not & I do not wish them to have it. Anterro   the Cheif of the Pampa Utes wish me to make a settlement there  and I want to say a word to you Brother Braadley I do not wish to   Excuse you I want you to go so that you can neither make whiskey   or get it. For any man that makes whiskey or Beer is guilty of putting  the cup to his Neighbors Lips and any man that will make whiskey  to sell here would sell the kingdom of God for a pickcayune. I have   shown by my acts what I think of whiskey making. I have the best   still in the Territory and as soon as the Gentiles brought whiskey to  this Territory I laid up my Still & I have not used it and I wish that   all the whiskey that the gentiles brought had been so filled with poison   as to have killed all who drank it. I despise the whiskey maker   more than I do the Thieves I have no fellowship for Either if I had  the power I would blow out the Brains of Evry thief in the Territory   yet I would rather a man would steal my ox Evry six months     
 Aug 27 19861  Than to ask one of my Family to drink whiskey with him one in   six month the thief is the best man of the two for the whiskey   maker will be of no use when he gets in Hell ownly to tocarry   swill to the Hogs.

Brother   Laney testified that when he was shot this dream was fulfilled. When   the Balls pearced his body through & through it did not hurt him more  than the scrach of a pin all though He bled at the mouth like an ox with   his trohroat cut yet he ckept running untill he was out of the reach of   the mob. A man came to him & said Brother Laney do not decieve   yourself about living. No man was Ever shot as you are who ever lived   But He said I shall live & not die & he did live by the power of God &   is now Harty & well & he said I had another Dream two years ago  which will be fulfilled as Follows.

He said in speaking of the coming of Christ "If Christ had  come & taken possession of the kingdom & set up his rule & government upon   the Earth [FIGURE] in the days of Noah, Moses, or at his first coming or even now   He would have Entirely defeated his own plan He would have cut off the agency   of man the Lord will not come to rule upon the Earth untill all the spirits  appointed to tabernacle in the flesh in this world have come & taken tabernacles   & been born, this Church & Kingdom has got to grow & progress in its present   organization untill the Zion of God is built upon the Earth & the New Jerrusalem   build & the bride prepared for her husband & when all things are prepared   Christ will come & take the kingdom & reign over the Earth but we are  not yet prepared for that Event if Christ was to come now to reign you   would not like his dictation as well as you do mine for I am more like   you than He is and he would be more strict in his deal[ings] & dictation   ywith you than I am. The Lord intends to try us & prove us whether we will   build up the kingdom & gather the saints in our poverty &c." At the close of the  meeting the President said in the vestry, speaking of our government He said   [FIGURE] Our Nation will not Have a general war all at one & then be setteled in a year  or two but the spirit of war, madness & disunion will increase for a number   of years they will commence to fight little by little & keep increase untill   they will have a general mash up & destruction throughought the  Land.

Smiths House Before leaving the  circle room President Young said I want to say a few words to Brother   Orson Hyde At the opening of this general Conference I was there  one minute before the time, & Brother Hyde had opened the Conference   had prayers & singing & I must say I was mortified I am the president  of the whole Church & it is my place to preside at a general   Conference. did you ever know me [to] step foreward in the days of Joseph  & take his place & open a General Conference without he directed me   to do it, or did you ever know me interfere with the rights of any   man No you have not. I should have waited an hour after the   time before I should have opened the Conference but Brother Hyde  opened it before the time & he has served me the same several   times and I dont want to see it any more. Elder Orson Hiyde  said it never Entered my heart that I was doing wrong several  who were president [present] said it was 10 oclok & asked me to open the Conference   & I ownly done it to open the way for you. Brother George asked me this  Noon to open the Conference & I told him No for I had heard that   you was not pleased about it G A Smith said I did ask him & it   did not Enter into my heart but what all was right. Brother Hyde   said He would remember it for the future, I do not think any  one of the Twelve thought of it. President Young said Now I will     
 April 7, 1861  ask all of you, how would you feel if you had a work to do which  God & the heavens held you responsible for & just as you was about to  step forth to do it another man should rise up & take it out of your hands  Before the people as though you was not qualifyed to Do it or& was neg-  lecting your duty you would not like it you would feel schagrined   and so did I. Now we can see by this how easy it is for a man   to walk into a mud hole when they think they are walking on solid ground  then let us all profit by this example & be careful that we do not   interfere with the rights of others. We then went over to President  Youngs and spent the evening we heard the Poney from the East read it  was up to the 1st of April      April 8, 1861 ~ Monday      8.

President Brigham Young in his instructions  to the missionaries said now I want you to remember what I say to  you, now take care that you do not get to sleep & let the devil take the  advantage of you. You may do that in an hour that you cannot rega-  in through all Eternity. Now you have great priviliges & nothing  [FIGURE] but the attainment of the Throne of a God is worth the attainment of   a Saints of God. your privliges are great what is the privilege of  the wicked they want the privilege to get drunk to Hore it & kill each  other is this a privilege no more than it would be to stick your   hand into a Burning stove. We have the privilege of living to all  Eternity and Enjoying Eternal life forever, while the wicked want   to kill his Neighbor. Now I want to say to you all quit your covetous-  ness, and whether you have little or much give it to bring the poor  to Zion and let the women alone, or it will prove a curse to you  Here is George Grant has no wife now let him not think of  a wife untill He gets back, this corting women while you are  abroad upon a mission is a miserable business, I would not give  shucks for an Elder who cannot go on a mission & keep clean & come  back clean. now remember that.

The South are better prepaired & much   faster than the North are. Lincoln has taken a course to rather   keep the North back. But the curse of God will be upon the   Nation and they will have Enough of it. The Rulers possess no   Power in the Land, they have persecuted the Saints of God   and the Rulers would do nothing for us but all they could against   us and they will now get their pay for it. In speaking of   Governor Cummings President Young Said He had done us good   He had stood between us & the army But the Lord had made   him do it. But He was united with the armey untill Col Kane   visited him when he first came here He was not going to the   army but I told him to go & to follow the same spirit that brought  him out here He done so he went to the armey, & brought in Gov.   Cummings. The Govornor & Col Johnson was at swords points from  that time. The question was asked what we would do if the   President sent Secretary Harris hiere as Govornor would we     
 April 278 1861  not also cecede. President Youndg said No, we will keep   our records clean we shall want to compare records by &   by & we want to show on our part that we are right all the  time. If the boys were all right they ought to piss such a man  as Harris out of the country or whittle him out yet if we subm  submit to such mean things put upon us by the government we shall  get our reward and they will get therirs it is better for us to   submit to those things which are unplesant than for us to do wrong   & for all the oppressions they put upon us God will bring them into  Judgment. In speaking of the war it is said that the South   threaten to burn the Northern Cities the North can play at that   Game also the ownly difficulty that I can see is there are   so many traiters in the North      April 29, 1861 ~ Monday      29 It is warmer to day it has been vary cold for more than   a week. I spent the fore noon making gates, and the afternoon   in the office Journalizing I wrote a letter to My daughter Phebe  yesterday. All the Preseidency met at the Historians office   W. Woodruff & F. D. Richards of the Twelve was also present   Warren Stone Snow was Blessed By President Young who gave him   a vary good Blessing. Brother Kimball also Blessed Br George   Pecock & gave him a good Blessing. In speaking of Geneol-  ogy & History President Young said I care so litle about it in my  feelings & spirit that as far as I am concerned that I should  not make more than one page of History. Still I like to see such  things got up Joseph would tell more in one hour about Geneology  than the world can in a year. He was particular about such  things much more so than I am but I expect He will be with   us. I expect if I live to be 80 years old I am in hops to have   some of the wisdom that Moses Had. He spoke of a remark   that He made in the 13 ward about Harris being sent here as Governor   He also said to Brother Kimball I took the liberty to curse those who  will still sustain our Enemies      April 30, 1861 ~ Tuesday      30th It is growing warmer President Young had an Appletree set in the streets   in the midst of a groop of Box Elder He set out a Spitzenburgh Apple      May 1, 1861 ~ Wednesday      May 1st A pleasant morning I spent the day in the office.

 May 1, 1861  Both North & South were gathering large armies and preparing for war   the Banks & rich men throughout the whole contry were consecrating   there millions of Dollars to sustain the war. The Nation has persecuted  the Saints of God & made them consecrate there all & flee from place to   to place to save their lives and now it is there turn, the Lord has said  [FIGURE] He would vex the Nation and he will suredly do it. Civil war has  begun in Earnest & it will go on untill the will of God is done all they have   sought to bring upon us will come to pass upon them.

Stewart & his Brother & hundreds of others I could  name Bishop Warren is another. They are a stink in my norstrials  they will trade with our Enemies and sustain them and they  would let in all Hell upon us for a few dimes they would  like to open a gold mine, Esstablish whiskey & Hore shops or  do any thing for Money & be hail fellows well met with these  Damned curses, They would cut my throat if they had   the power. But I will live to see them Damned & in Hell  and these Stewarts & Hanks & your Bishop are among us  as Saints, and we take them by the hand and call them   Brother, But I have no more fellowship for them than I have  for the Devils in hell, and I curse them in the name of   Jesus Christ and the curse of God shall rest upon them   from this hour, and they will see the day they will be glad to  lick up the dust of the feet of the meanest Saint in the celesti-  al Kingdom of God, such men are not worth Hall room   and the curse of Almighty God shall rest upon them.

 Dec 31st 1860  This is the last day of 1860 which Ends this important & momentious  year, which has been looked forward to by thousands for many years  as a period which would date the commencement of great & mighty  changes in the Earth, changes which would greatly Effect the interest  & welfare of all Nations under Heaven. Now what are the facts in the  case as far as they have come to the knowledge of the Historiamn. T[h]ay are  these. The whole European world have appeared inspired to spend  millions & labor with all their might to build Navies & Equipt armies  & prepare For a mighty struggle & deadly conflict with Each others  All Italy has risen up in the magesty of her streng[th]s under her great  leader Garabaldi and flung off ^the^ galling Napolitan yoke and formed   an Elective Monarchy Receiving Victor Emanuel as their king  England & France has made both war & peace with the Chineese  Empire while they have both been preparing there armies & Navies for  a Bloody struggle at home. But the United States of America   is the spot whare 1860 markes the commencement of a new Erea in  the History of that Government & people, it is [in] the midst of this Government  whare the God of Heaven has set up his kingdom in the Latter Days  He sent An angel to this people thirty years ago raised up a prophet   called & ordained him to preach the gospel of Christ & Esstablish his   Church & kingdom in the midst of the people. Joseph the prophet of God   was Faithful to his calling, esstablished the Church of Christ, was filled  with revelation & prophesy declaired the word of God unto the people  told them what would come to pass in there midst the wars and   Judgments of God that awaited them because of there wickedness  and as Jesus told the Jews the Fate & calamities that awaited the  Jewish Nation so Joseph Smith the Prophet of God told the people of  the United States Government what awaited them & there final  Destiny as a Nation because of there wickedness & abominations & because  they would shed the Blood of Prophets & Saints. He said in 1832, 28 years  ago that South Carolinia would rise up in rebelion and that war  would commence at that place & that the Southern States would arise  up in rebelion against the Northern States & the Northern States against  the Southern States & that war would be poured out upon all  Nations which would End in the death & miser of many of many   souls & because of these things or as the prophet has said the people of the     
 1860  United States have put to death the prophet Joseph the Patriarchs   Apostle & many Saints and driven the Church of Christ from   place to place for about thirty years and, Finally have driven  them into the wilderness even into the these vallies of the Mountain  and the Lord told us "to plead at the feet of the Judges Governors  & Presidents of the United States & if they Heed us not and do not   redress us of our wrongs (then the Lord says) I will arise out of   my hiding place & in my fury I will vex the Nation and I   will cut off those wicked & unjust stewards and appoint them   there portiuns with Hipocritts & unbelievers. 1860 has laid the   foundation for the fulfillment of these things during this year the  Abolitionest of Republicans of the Northern States Elected their  President and Vice President and this has been taken as a pretext  and the Southern States are rising up in rebelion agast the Northern  States are holding conventions & preparing to cecede from the Union  as Joseph Smith said they would. South Carolinia ceceded  from the Union on the 270 Dec 1860 and others are preparing to  follow their example this has caused a great convultion throughout  the United States all Banking & monied institutions are suspending  specia payment, and the wheels of Government are beginging to be cloged  alarm & confusion is spreading throughout the whole land. The  Lord is withdrawing his spirit from the Nation and they are begining  to be filled with madness towards Each other and the Southern   States are arming & preparing for a Deadly conflict against the  Northern States and whome the Lord wants to destroy he first makes  mad and the people are being inspired with madness to such a degree  that they are ready to devour each other, the foundation has been  laid during the year 1860 To break up & annihilate the American  Government and the scenes which will follow in quick succession   will be terrible & horrible in their detail. This Nation is guilty of  sheding the Blood of the Lords anointed, of his Prophets & Saints  and the Lord Almighty has decreed their destruction the  Lord has commenced a controversy with the American Government  and Nation in 1860 and he will never cease untill they are  destroyed from under heaven, and the Kingdom of God esstablished   upon their ruins. Let the Gentiles upon this land prepare to meet their God

 WILFORD WOODRUFF'S  JOURNAL  FOR  1861     
 January 1, 1861 ~ Tuesday      JAN 1st 1861  This is the commencement of another new Year and of a vary  important year. Joseph Smith the Prophet said whoever lived to  see 1860 would live to see the foundation laid for some most awful  bloody wars and whoever lived to see those two figgures come together  1866 would live to see a day when the Earth would be deluged in blood  in many places & wthere would be such awful distress & calamity that  it would be a vexation to hear the report of it. We may prepare   ourselves for an awful time in the United States. The hand writing has  been seen upon the wall And our Nations is doomed to diestruction  the United States will be visited this year with much affliction  more than they have ever seen since they have been a Free Govern[men]t   and it will increase yearly untill they are destroyed. they are like  the Ox going to the slaughter they know not the day of their visitation  The Judgments of God await them because of their wickedness and  while we are looking for the judgments of God to rest upon the  United States & Great Babylon at large let us turn our Eyes towards  Zion in these vallies of the Mountains and ask what state are the   people in are they righteous & keeping the commandments of God  and preparing themselves for the great things of God which await  them or are they lying, stealing, swareing, & mingling with the   drunken yes many of those who are calling themselves   Saints are doing these things and they have great need to repent  before the Lord. or they will Be damned & the Judgments of   God will rest upon them      South Carolinia seceded from the Union Dec 20, 1860      Missisippi Convention voted to secede from the Union Jan 9, 1861 Yeas 84 Nays 15      Georgia seceded Jan 10th 1861, yeas 208 Nays 89      Florida seceded Jan 10th [1861,] signed 11th Yeas 62 Nays 7.

 Jan 1st 1861   The Dedication of the New Hall in the 13th ward       The assembly began to gather at 10 oclok at 11 oclok the House   was full. President Brigham Young & Heber C Kimball arived the   Meeting was opened by singing & President Young said we will now   have the Dedication Prayer offered By Wilford Woodruff the following   is the prayer offered up in the dedication of the House      O god the FaEternal Father we present ourselves before thee in the name   of Jesus Christ for the purpose of dedicating this house unto the Lord our   God we pray thee to grant unto us thy Holy Spirit that we may dedicate this   House unto thee in a manner which may be acceptable unto thee Lord   We dedicate the ground unto the Lord our God upon which the Foundation   of this building stands that it may be Holy. We dedecate the foundation   of this Hall, unto the Lord, the stone, the sand, clay, Lime & mortar and every   thing appertaining thereto that it may be Holy. We dedicate the walls of this   building the Adobies & mortar & evry thing appertaining thereto unto   the Lord that it may be Holy. We dedicate the windows the curtains, &   every thing conenected there with unto the Lord that they may be Holy. We dedic-  ate the cealing the cornish, with its ornamenting and all belonging thereto   that it may be Holy. We dedicate the roof with the shingles, nails, sheeting,   rafters, & everything connected therewith unto the Lord that it may be Holy   We dedicate the doors with the Hinges latches & locks and all belonging thereto   unto the Lord that they may be Holy. We dedicate the floor with all belong   the seats & all belonging there to that it may be Holy. We dedicate   unto the Lord our God this pulpit & stand with the quishions & stand  seats & triming that it may be the most Holy place for the priests of the   Lord to administer in Holy things. We dedicate the chandeliers with   the Lamps that they may be Holy unto the Lord. We dedicate this Build-  ing as a whole from the foundation stone to the top thereoff with   every thing appertaining thereto that it may be Holy unto the Lord  and we ask thee O God the Eternal Father wein askthe thee inname of Jesus   Christ that thou will except of the Dedecation of this House at the   Hands of thy people that it may be Holy, and will thou cloth   all of thy servants who shall administer in this House with the spirit   & power of God & the gift of the Holy Goshost that they may     
 1861  Be Holy and may no unclean thing be permitted to dwell  in this House. Whether the Priest of the Lord administer in   Holy things in this House or whether thy sons & daughters go  forth in the dance in this House, may the spirit of the Lord   rest upon thy people that they commit no evil within the   walls of this House. We ask thee O God the Eternal Father   that thou wilt except of the dedication of this House at the   Hands of thy People in the Name of Jesus Christ Amen      At the close of the dedication Prayer President Brigham   Young arose and addressed the assembly He said as concerning   thatis House "&cI know but vary little about it I do not know for what  purpose it was built if it was built for meetings alone I am satisfied   with it, but if it was built for school purposes it is not suitable I   have not been consulted concerning the building of this Hall, I did not   know that thery were building it untill the walls were Erected   I wonce gave a pattern for building schools houses in this city   for each ward but there has never been a school House built after   that pattern in this Territy. My pattern was sumthing like the   following Build two wings 20 By 30 feet for common schools   then build a centre Building say 30 by 60 feet make a Basement for   seting furnices or stoves for heating the whole building but not for  school rooms. On the first floor above the basement at the south   End build a room for a Library then let there be a door   from each wing into the Library. OnLet the north End of the  same room be appropriated for teaching the Higher Branches   and Let all scholars be classaified according to their ages   and qualifycations. Then let the 2nd story be formed into one room  for a lecture room similar to this whare one class or all classes   may assemble to hear lectures upon any subject what ever.  I wish to give a word of council to the people I shall not give  any to the Bishop but I wish to say to the people dont you send   your children to go to school in this basement story it is not Healthy   asconcerning the Education of children I will say that not withstand-  ing the drivings of this people I do not believe that you can   go into any city in the world & pick up 100 children promiscusly     
 1861  and put them by the side of our children that are as well educated   as the same number of our children gathered up promiscusly in the  Territory of Utah. There are some people & countries who force   & whip their children into an Education but we should never   croud & force the minds of our children beyoung what they are able  to bear if we do we ruin them for life. I would rather my children  would spend their Early life sliding down Hill, skating, riding Horses   till they were 20 years old & not go to school one day than to clog   & force the mind while young with intricate studies it strains & cripples  the mind for life & ruins the man, you never see a child that is confin-  ed while young to close rooms & hard study & followed up to manhood  that ever becomes a master spirit or qualifyed to transact difficult   business in after life. I do not think there is a man upon the face of   the whole Earth that has as great a complicated variety of subjects   & things to attend to to weigh upon the mind as I have, at the same  time, I do not think there is a man upon Earth who can accomplish   as much business in an hour, day, month, or year, with as much Ease   and as little trouble as I do. But should I do as most people do it would   soon ruin me. But I thoroughly train my mind so that I permit   nothing to trouble me upon the Earth. I strive to do my duty in all things   upon the Earth then leave the Event with the Lord when any subject or   thing comes before me I train my mind in such away that I can bring   the whole force & strength of my mind to bear upon it and I keep it  there untill I have done with the subject I comprehend every truth  there is connected with the subject necessiary for the accomplish-  ment of whatever business is before me, & as soon as the business is  done I train my mind to instantly forget it & cast it away & should   never think of it again unless some circumstance should transpire   necessary to call it up. I am now at the dedication of this Hall   my mind is here when I get through & go away I may never   think of this meeting again unless some person should call it to   my mind. when I have been crouded with business through the day   & I go to my bed to rest though I may not be any more sleepy than   I am now, the moment I lie down I throw evry thing out of my mind  untill it is like a peace of white blank paper I neither care for nothing   nor know nothing & in one minute I am asleep my wife has spoken     
 Jan 1st 1861  to me many times in one minute after I have lain down & awaik  me up. mMany other interesting remarks were made By President   Young which I have not written but it was reported by J. V. Long  Brother Kimball Followed President Young and gave a vary good   Exertation to the people which waf [was] reported By J. V. Long. He was   Followed By Bishop Woolley who spoke of the Building of the House   the intention of it, & thanked the Lord for it & gave a good exerta-  tion which was reported He was Followed by Elder Lorenzo Snow  who gave a good exertation & spoke of what we learn by experience &c   I followed Brother Lorenzo Snow & said we were in a great school &   the best ever esstablished upon Earth & that we had the best teacher   ever given to man in the flesh save Jesus ownly and when they taught  us principle we should learn them & apply them to our lives the same as  we expect our children to learn there lessons when they go to school  I was Followed by President Brigham Young who refered to what  I and others had said, he said we should never scease to learn   He spoke of Drunkenness & said if a man must drink to buy his liquor  & shut himself up and get drunk alone & not curse anybody or commit   sin when you are drunk always bless those around you & not curse them   but it is better not to get drunk at all      Brother Jeter Clinton spoke & gave a good Exertation    Meeting was dismissed by Bishop Edward Hunter. There was a   large party in the Hall through the night danceing      January 2, 1861 ~ Wednesday      Jan 2nd I spent the day mostly at home.

He says we ought not to preach what we do not practice I do not   do it I have got two years provision laid up also clothing Brother Woodruff   here lays up provision & clothing, there are but few that do it. Now how   many will preach to the people & tell them to be like God while they do not  attempt to imitate the Lord but if a wife do not please them they will   pitch their wife or child out of doors and soon loose all the Lord has given  him now If we done as the Lord does if our families did not do right & obey   us we would bear with them, & feed them, & cloth them, and treat them   kindly that they may be saved. Look & se how long the Lord bears with the   [FIGURE] wicked He rains upon the Just & unjust & if we want to be like the Lord   we should bear with the weaknesses of our wives & children. he said He  had some wives who had never been subject to his council & will yet   yet He took good care of them & treated them kindly {He had one woman that had   committed adultery yet he fed her and took care of her but did not sleep with her as a wife} He said many [things] which were   Edifying.

A pleasant morning I attended the funeral of Charles Little, the son of   [FIGURE] Jesse C Little. President Young preached a short discourse on the occasion  No reporter the following is a synopsis of what he said    I reflected upon the subject of coming to this funeral I thought If I   come Brother Little would wish me to speak and I thought I should want  much of the spirit of the Lord to assist me to overcome my weakness to which   I am subject on occasions like this. At times I can overcome it. The question   has often been asked how is it with little children will they grow or not   after death Joseph once said they would, & then He said they would not  He never had any revelation upon the subject. And I have no doctrin     
 31 Jan 1861  to give upon the subject. I Believe in the great variety in the vast creations  of God. I do not Believe that the Lord ever made two worlds alike or things  alike in any world, I do not believe that the Human family have been  alike in stature in the various ages of this world. The Lord has power   to give a soul or spirit as miuch intelligence in a tabernacle 2 or 3 feet high  as in a gient 8 or 10 feet high as we find Evidences that in some ages of   this world men have lived to that hight. My doctrin or belief is that  we shall find all children & People at the resurrection as they lie down  with the same stature, that is the way I want to receive my children  if I bury a child that is two years old, I dont want him or her to come  to me in a tabernacle 80 or 100 years old or at any other age ownly the  age it left me and that is the way I believe it will be. We shall see  there spirits before we see there bodies. Whare shall we go to find them  in the spirit world but whare is that right here on the Earth whare they  lived & whare we live. I have desired to see the spirit of a Friend & to convers  with it as I would with you, but I have never yet had this privilege  I want to know how they live in the spirit world what for a place they  have as I would come & look at Brother Littles House. But I believe all  spirits live here after Death and no whare Els, at least those who have taberna-  cled in the flesh on the Earth, whether they be good or bad, Satan has no power  over those who have overcome him in the flesh after they are dead but he has  power over those who all their lives have been subject to him in the flesh.  I will now ask how does any one present know what I say my words  have a shape to them as much as this chair and the shape of my words  go to the drum of your Ear so that you get an understanding of what I   say Now in speaking in the Tabernacle if I turn to the north the shape   of my words strike the drum of the Ear & they understand it perfectly  the words strike the wall break the shape to peaces & the sound strikes the  Ear of those in the South as much as in the North but they do not  understand what is said. Now if I had force of Lungs & power to throw  the shape of my words to China they would understand what I say   as well as you do in the further part of this room they would hear it as  well. You know when you have a vision you can see as well all over   your Body as out of your Eye. When Joseph had a revelation he had the Eyes  of the Lord He saw as the Lord sees how did I know what was going on  in Washington. I have known what was going on there all the time     
 31st Jan 1861  And I know what is going on in other peoples Houses, I know it  by the spirit of God it is revealed to me. Do spirits administer to  us they do but we do not know it. Charles here will administer to   his mother but she will not know it. these things are so ordered  and governed that we may be tried and if Sister Little was to  die & go whare her children are in the spirit world she would do  just so, she would not administered to her friends openly for  she would see that it was for a wise purpose that there was a veil  between the living & the dead that the living might be tryed and  have a greater glory, the living cannot see the departed spirits  but the departed spirits can see the living and administer to  them while they know it not. We are all in the spirit world &  in Eternity but we know it not & do not comprehend it. My   wife awoke in the morning that Charles died & said to me I think  Charles Little is dead for I have seen him to night with Joseph in  a dream and if Brother & Sister Little could see what I have they  would not wish him back. He was vary happy with Joseph and  Joseph said he wanted him he had a particular place for him, and He  looked glorious. Many questions have arises in relation to the death  of children. Some have thought that it was ordained that children should  die. But this is not true doctrin it is not ordained of God that children  should die, but it is the will of God that all children should live and   grow up to manhood & fill up the measure of there days if they could  do it and overcome the evils they have to meet with in life but  they meet with so much of the Law of Death & so many Evils that  many die in childhood & at all ages. you may ask why should not  they have a chance to prove themselves as well as we. As I said before  there is a great variety the Human family die at all ages & children   that die thwill have a fulness of glory they will be as happy as they  are capable of being, will they have another probation or chance   of being tried as we are are I have many reflections upon this  subject but it is a doctrin I shall say nothing about. we should  be satisfyed with the principle that our children will be restod  restored to us again in their glorifyed bodies with the same   statu[r]e that they were taken from us, and they will admin-  ister to us though we know it not it is hid from us for a wise purpose     
 31st Jan 1861  To give you a figure I will say to a man for instance if you will   go to Big Cotton wood Blindfolded I will give you a reward of Ten  thousand dollars but you cannot have it if you go with your Eyes  open to see the road, the man starts Blind folded fearing & trembling  lest he shall run a foul of wild cattle, into ditches, & difficulties, yet  he gropes his way & gets through claims his reward & gets it so in  the dealings of the Lord with us He does not let us see every thing in  the future before us but makes us promises & makes us walk by faith  that we may obtain them and the greater our trials & conquests   the greater will be our crown & glory. So all those who have been  tried & got through do not wish to administer to us in that way   that they will make it any lighter for us than it has been for  them that all may be tried alike as far as is consistent with  the Economy of God      Joseph Young followed then W Woodruff & E. D. Woolley I returned   to the office & made this report      February 1, 1861 ~ Friday      Feb 1. I spent the day in the office I wrote a letter to G. A.

A High Council was appointed at the close of the afternoon   service by the unanimous vote of the people. At Early candle light we   met in the vestry of the Tabernacle to ordain the High Council many   of the Priesthood were present Brother Taylor myself & Brother Farr ordained   the 12 men a High Council in that Stake of Zion. We ordained 6 of them   High Priests who were seventies I was informed that a list of names     
 10 Feb 1861  was presented to President Young to pick out the High Council & He named  six of them & Brother Farr nominated the other six after they were ordained  the spirit & power of God rested upon me & I spoke to them about half   an hour upon the subjet of the Priesthood & the magnifying of that Priesthood  and meeting all responsibilities required at hour hands all deeply felt the  power of God that was present I exhorted them to temperance & every good  word & work which would exhalt them before God. Elder Taylor followed  & made some good remarks. We went to Brother Wests & spent the night      February 11, 1861 ~ Monday      [FIGURE] 11th Bishop Wests took us into his sleigh and drove us to South Webber   whare we had an appointment to regulate that Branch of the Church the   Bishop was in apostacy & was leading away others, they had got away others  a New Prophet to slide out of the Church upon. We had a large assembly of   saints from other Places. Bishop Cook came in & opened the way by singing   & Prayer I then called upon Bishop Richard Cook to speak and   requested him to tell us his feelings if he believed in Joseph Morris as   a Prophet to tell us so, & to tell us what his feelings were in relation to the  Presidency of the Church. He arose & spoke some time without touching the   subject. I again requested him to come to the point He then "said "yes I do   Believe in Richa Joseph Morris as a Prophet whom God has raised up  to lead this Church & Kingdom agreeable to the Revelation in the   Doctrins & Covenants which says I will raise up unto you a Prophet  like unto Moses &c [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:16##] I do not Believe that Brigham Young is a prophet   or has ever had any revelation or inspiration more than any sectari-  an Priest, & I believe this Church will ownly be known in name in   10 years unless God does raise up a Prophet." When he closed several   of his party got up & Bore the same testimony we then sent for there   fals Prophet & called upon him to speak, he spoke about half an hour He   said Brigham Young was not a prophet & Joseph Smith did not hold the   Keys of the Priesthood & was ordained of man while He Joseph Morris was   ordained of the Father, & held six times more keys of the Priesthood than   Joseph did He said he was the seventh Angel, & much other nonsens he   Presented before the Assembly, when He got through Elder Taylor spoke   to the Assembly & showed tbrother Cook the Position He was in. He bore  testimony that Brigham Young was a prophet of God & he said that He him-  self was more of a Prophet than Morris was. Brigham Young in saying     
 11 Feb 1861  that He did not profess to be a prophet seer & Revelator as Joseph   Smith was, was speaking of men being born Natural Prophets & Seers   many have the gift of seeing through seer stones without the Priesthood   at all He had not this gift naturally yet He was an Apostle & the   President of the Church & Kingdom of God on the Earth and all the  Keys of the Holy Priesthood & of Revelation was sealed upon him & the   spirit & power of Revelation was upon him daily when He closed   I spoke to the people & bore testimony to the truth of what Elder Taylor   had said. Morris had been cut off from the Church twice for   Adultery in the Territory And He had spent about one year with  a woman whose husband was crazy. I told morris that He was not   a Prophet of God Neither was He the seventh Angels that when the  7th Angel came to Earth He would not spend the first year of his   mission with a woman whose Husband was crazy & commit Adultery   with Her. I showed the folly of Richard Cook & others following such a   man. When I closed my remarks Morris Denyed of Being with   that woman. Bishop West arose & bore testimony that what I   had said was true. We then took all the Names of the persons   who professed to believed in Joseph Morris as the prophet of God  raised up to lead the Church. there was 16 Names Given as follows  Richard Cook William Kendall Nels Morrison Mrs Hannah Cook   John Cook Robert Farley Nathan Brooks Mrs Margaret Cook   John Firth John Parsons John Trolsom Mrs Hellen Cook  Mrs Sarah Cook Mrs Mary Cook Mrs Joanna Kendall  John Taylor then moved that those sixteen named persons be   cut off from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I   seconded the motion & they were cut off from the Church without  a disscenting voice. We then Nominated Philo Allen to Preside over   the remainder of that Branch of the Church which was carried   unanimously we also voted to unite that Branch to Ogden under the   charge of the President & Bishop of that Place. We took dinner with   Philo Allen we then rode to Ogden & spent the night with James Brown 18 mils      February 12, 1861 ~ Tuesday      12 We rode North Ogden held a meeting with the people at 11 oclok   spoke upon Tithing & other subjects I spoke first was followed by Elder   Taylor we took dinner with Bishop Dunn then rode to Willow   Creek & held a meeting with the people & spent the night with Bishop Alfred Cordon     
 13 1860  I am not a Bishop, but in a Bishops meeting and I feel like saying a  few words as President Young has given liberty. It matters not to me   whether the lash hits me or you in the reproofs given by President  Young, I feel to thank God that we are blessed with a leader who has   indipendence of mind sufficient to do the will of God let it reprove or   rebuke who it may. He asks no odds of any kingdom, Nations, people  person or thing who stands in the way of his doing his duty. It is a  Blessing to us that we have a leader who have Eyes to see for us when we are  in danger ourselves and if we had not some one to warn us and reprove  us when we do wrong we would not be safe. President Young is sustained   by the power of God and when he calls upon us to do any thing we ought  to do it, and if we withhold we do it to our hurt. the Elders in England  have beged of the people, untill they have bound them in chanes and  kept them there in poverty if the Elders had pursued a wise course  there are thousands who are now in England who would this day  have been in Zion, then let us go to & fit out the missionaries and  stop there begging from the poor.

 September 23, 1860 ~ Sunday      Sept 23 1860  Sunday I attended a Funeral of Sister Nancy Kent the oldest sister  of Brigham Young she died Sept 22nd 1860 Aged 74 years old 3rd Aug 1860  John was 69, May 22nd May 1860 Phineas 61, 16 Feb 1860,  Joseph 7th April 1860, 64 years old Brigham was 59, June 1, 1860,   Lorenzo 54, 19, Oct 1860.    Meeting opened By singing "Ear long the veil" vPrayer By Joseph Young  John Young then spoke and said v [I] fell [feel] to acknowledge the Hand of God   in this thing. I dont fell this to be a matter of mo^u^rning though we feel  to mis the society of our Friends when taken away, but we must follow our sister  soon, and I pray that I may be as well prepared as she is. Nancy was the  oldest of the Family and the last of the sisters that was taken away she is in  her 75 year 57 years since she was married and she has always been  a good woman and always kind to all. I dont know as I ever knew her   get out of the way she hag [had] good gifts and she received the gospel the first  time she recieved itherd it she has been faithful to the last and now gone to   the spirit world I have not the power to make manifest that which is in  me we must do the best we can in this life & in the next we shall  receive a fulness but before I go home I want to have my work done   so that I can breath out my spirit in peace into the Hands of God. I  want to use my time so that I have nothing to repent off. I want to  live to do my work for If we leave our work to be done by somebody   els to do it will be a long time before it is done Like an Elder going on a  mission leaves work to be done By some one Els it is undone.    Phineas Young said I have been Edified in what has been said yet   there has been Nothing said that I want to say, when my Friends  die I want to speak of them If I was to say which of my sisters is  the best I coold not tell, the last is gone, and the Brothers have got to follow   but I dont know who will go first. But if I was to make a choice &   chuse the one that has done the least good in the world or the one that was  still likely to do the least good on the Earth it would be myself. I would  like to go to the spirit world & be with my sisters I dont expect to do much  good in this life yet I feel that I have done about the best I could.   I dont want to live my life over again to try to Better it for I  dont expect I should. I dont want to live any longer than it is  the will of God I should     
 Sept 23 1860  Joseph Young spoke gave a good exertation but I have lost the  minutes for the present      Brigham Young spoke and said I dont want to say much at this  time though I reflect much & could say a good deal. I expet that   it will appear a Novel thing for a man to preach the funeral   sermon of his wife or sister or any of his own Family but I had  rather preach the funeral sermon of my own Family or call upon  my Brothers to do it than to call upon any body Els. there is a  fear or trembling in the departure of the spirit from the body because  it is attended with pain I have no fear of Being dead or being  in the spirit world but there is a fear in dying because of pain  Hence their is a terror in death, but no fear in having my spirit  free but to get there is hard work. If the children of men   was in possession of the truth concerning Eternal things they would   not cling to life as they do. you know my feelings about mans   singing & doing wrong. I have been kept from Evil, sin, & suffering even  in all the mobing I have escaped whiping imprisionment and suffering  and I feel that I have greater resason to rejoice I dont know  that is because I am more righteous than other men But I have   greater reason to rejoice than other men in this thing. Sister Nancy  was a good woman I never knew her get angry in my life  or do wrong she would have done much good in her day if she had   a chance she has benen chained as it were but she has saved her-  self & her husband and I think others, I dont wish her back   again. nor do I want to live my life over again neither do I  want any of my sisters to return I do not wish to keep the people longer  Lorenzo Young said there is a difference in men some were prepared  for the gospel others not. I dont care how rough my life may be  if I do the best I can. I was with Nancy a good deal and her   last words were Hosannah glory to God she wanted to say more but her  speech failed. I do not wish to say much let us do good and shun  Evil that we may not bring sorrow upon ourselves. I have often though[t]  what would be the situation of many that have had great light and  fallen away so that they could have no redemption there situation  must be awful. it has been great Joy to Nancy to be with Brother  Brigham & her friends, may God Bless us all is my prayer Amen     
 23 1860  I accompanied the corps to the grave after the corps was buried President  Young returned thanks to the friends for there attendance & said I hope  we may all live so that we can meet her in the morning of the first   resurrection. I attended meeting at the stand at 2 oclok & Wm C.  Stanes spoke & was followed By J. D. T. McCalaster Wm Martindale   J. L. Smith A Calkings followed By B Young & H C. Kimball, both of  which spoke much to the Edifycation of the people      At the close of the meeting The Presidency & Twelve met the missionaries at  the Historian office. several were Blessed among the Number was O Pratt  Erastus Snow G Q Cannon, & Wm H Hooper, after which we repaired to   the prayer room, whare we had a vary interesting meeting. The  subject of Orson Pratt came up again concerning his fals doctrin  President Kimball wished him to make satisfaction to President Young  But President Young said he did not wish him to make any acknowled-  ments to him Brother Pratt was strangely constituted he had acquired  a good deal of knowledge upon many things but in other things he was  one of the most ignorant men he ever saw in his life He was full of integ-  rity & would lie down & have his head cut off for me or his religin   if necessary but he will never see his Error untill he goes into the  spirit world then he will say Brother Brigham how foolish I was  Now Brother Pratt thinks that he and all the gGods will be learning  for many millions of years but by & by will know all things & all  will know it alike & that will be the End of their Exhaltations & knowledge  he cannot see the folly of forming this opinion here in the flesh  & in his ignorance. But a thousand years hence he will see the folly  of it I will hold on to Brother Pratt & all these my Brethren of  the Twelve (notwithstanding all their sins, folley, & weaknesses) untill I  met with them in my Fathers kingdom, to part no more because  they love God and are full of integrity. Brother Pratt said I do not   believe as Brother Brigham & Brother Kimball do in some points of doctrin  & they do not wish me to acknowled to a thing that I do not believe  Brother Brigham said No you cannot see the truth in this matter untill  you get into the spirit world. Brother Brigham spake vary comforting   words to the 12 He said his love for them was far above women & I wish  you could all say it. Brother Wells Prayed & John Taylor was mouth  W Woodruff was appointed a missionarycommittee to fit out the missionaries

Woodruff J. Taylor G. A. Smith Lorenzo Snow Erastus Snow   & G Q Cannon of the Twelve present I never saw President Young feel   Better. He gave a short address He said the gentile chain was broaken   & they would never put their yoke again upon the neck of the saints   or church & Kingdom of God to all Eternity if we would do our   duty He blessed the Saints, and gave instruction to the sisters upon   the subject of wearing Hoops. He said when we followed that custom   we followed the custom of Hores & prostitute women and all   who ware large hoops expose themselves and show there folly He   advised the Sisters to lay them aside He gave good advice to all & had  much of the spirit of the Lord He said we might build as many   Halls as we pleased & we should not find any place whare we should  feel as well & have as much peace as we did in that Hall & he   warned the brethren not to attend balls or parties in the world with   the gentiles for then you are upon the gentile ground & the devils   ground & he will have power over you But if I invite Gentiles   to attend a party here they are under my controll & the spirit   of the Lord governs & the Gentiles have to be subject to it but go   to a Ball of there getting up & you become subject to them in spite   of all you can do then let it Entirely alone.

Robert moved my sugar mill down to the   farm to day & Wilford drew sand & Adobies. President Young said   on sunday night Sept 23 to Orson Pratt & Erastus Snow now if

I[n] conversing about merch[an]t-  dize with Capt Hooper President Young said I think & then I dont think   but before I enter into business I want to have the right bump touched   in my head by an Angel or the spirit of God before I act. H. S.   Eldridge did not go East for the Church but upon his own responsib-  ility. Yet He done some business for us but I should not have sent   him I dont want the interest upon the money the brethren put into   Banks all I want is the principle Brother Cannon could make enough   in England upon Exchanges to support himself & family.
