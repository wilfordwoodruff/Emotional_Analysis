 JAN 1st 1859January 1, 1859 ~ SaturdayThis is a vary plesant New Years morning. One year ago this morning I reflected in my own mind upon thescenes which lay before us as a people and asked the Question whare another new Year would find me and my Brethren for we were threatened with war and extermination by the General Government and an armey of several thousand men lay upon our borders ready at the opening of spring to try to begin to put their threats into Execution but the Lord has warded off the blow & we still occupy our houses, gardens, orchards, fields, cities & Tabernacleand this is the Lords doing, & it is marvelous in our Eyes. and we now have the army in our midst under the form of peacewe have the United states courts in our midst who are striving to stir up strife in the midst of this people May the Lord protect his saints through 1859 and in all time to come from the evil design of our Enemies And may he so lead the President& Congress of the United States that they shall not be able to accomplish any evil design against the Church, Kingdom& Zion of our God which dwells in these vallies of the mountainsbut may the Lord so guide & controll the helm of state so as to give us a state Government or esstablish the Kingdom of God on the Earth May he inspire the heart of his servant Brigham continually with power, light, & truth so that He may continue to lead the Church & kingdom of God in peace & safety as he has done heretofore untill the saints of the Most Highshall possess the kingdom in power & Glory and be prepared for the comeing of the Son of ManI spent a part of the day in the office & the evening at homeSeveral of the Brethren called in & spent the evening with meLorenzo Snow, S.

H. Wells Advocated Websters spelling Book But Towns was prefered by most of the board. I informed the board that I could get from Sanbon & Carter of Portland all those works which they were manufacturing at a cheap rate that that was the class of Books now in use throughoutthe New England States, this was done through the common consent of a convention of teachers who sat at PortlandPresident Young spoke upon the subject of the New AlphabetHe said I think we are the Head & not the tail and nowif I had my way I will tel you what I would do I would put Books into the hands of children in this Territory printed in the Deseret Alphabet I dont want many Books to learn children. I told the Bishops when I first came 
 Jan 31to this country to build their school houses on a plan which I gave them there has been many wings built but nota centre building in the Territory I would classify all the children I would put the Little children all together & I would take a girl or some one capable of teaching them & Iwould have a good Black board and I would teach the Alphabetupon that one book would be enough in the Room I do not believe in putting Books into the hands of Little children to pour over & make them sit on a hard Bench untill they akeall over. If I was a Teacher I would make them rise up & march around the house and I would try to interest theirminds so they would delight to learn but many persons who have learning sufficient to teach a school yet they are not fit to teach children as soon as a child does sumthing that does not pleas the teacher He begins to pound the childwith a ruler over the Head & back or slaps him in the side of the Head with his hand this is not the way to treat childrenYou put a work into the hands of a Jerman FrenchmanDane or Sweed or any other Nation printed in the DeserettAlphabet & in a little time they will all read and spell alike much sooner than they could learn a new language several of the brethren spoke D.

The committee of the Regencyspent the evening with President Young writing Hebrew in the deseret Alphabet on the black board for, exercise. I spent the evening at home teaching my Family the Deseret AlphabetFebruary 12, 1859 ~ Saturday12. I spent the day in the office examining letters for History I spent the evening with the board of directors of the D A & Msociety we appointed Thomas Bullock our secretary as R Campbellhad resigned in consequence of a multiplicity of busines.[FIGURE] I wrote a Letter to Joseph Harris & sent 1 subscriberFebruary 13, 1859 ~ Sunday13th Sunday I attended meeting at the Tabernacle Gilbert ClementsPreached upon the first principles of the gospel was followed byElder O Hyde with a strong exertation He objected to anyperson selling whiskey & then coming into this desk to preach which Brother Clements had done yet he did not call him by name. I met my Quorum my son Wilford Prayed & I was mouth in the circle. The first Patriarch of thechurch Joseph Smith sen blessed me & my wife Phebe he said I should have sons who should bear the Holy Priesthood& be great men in the Earth & be honorable men in Zionwhile he [Wilford] was praying I thought of my Blessing. I spentan hour with President Young in the afternoon. He spoke upon the subject of the Book published by Mother Smith called Joseph Smith the Prophet He said he wished us to take up that work & revise it & correct it that it belonged to the Historians to attend to it that there was many fals statements made in it and he wished them to be left out and all other statements which we did not know to be true, and give the reason why they are left out. G. A. Smith & Elias Smith should be present 
 Feb 13That Book makes out william smith according to Mother Smith's statement to be full of the Holy Ghost & the power of God while at the same time I herd him say in the presence of Heber C. Kimball while Joseph Smith was a prisioner in the hands of his enemies and I said that God would deliver him, william smith said Dam him Joseph Smith ought to have been hung up by the neck years ago [FIGURE] and Dam him he will get it now any how.President Brigham Young said wm smith is the most wicked man I ever saw in my life He has been filled with all manner of wickedness. When I was in Nauvoo I commenced to build me a carriage william got up a rumor that I was Finishing a carriage for my own use which Joseph had commenced for his mother then Mother Smith soon reported that I was building her a carriage and the first time she got me in company she asked me for that carriage I did not care much about the carriage but I was sorry to have her take that course. w woodruffremarked that Mother Smith was under the influence of wm smith and the spirit of Aposticy which was in Nauvoo. President Young said yes I do not think the Lord would impute Evil to her and I shall meet with her in Eternity and I am sure I shall not bring an Accusation against her. Elder O Pratt published that work & bought it of A. W. Babbitt at a high Price whenwe had a copy of it in our office, it is marvellous that He should have published it without my council. Many other remarks were made by President Young (see private Journal)I met with the Twelve in the prayer circle I opened by prayer G. A Smith was mouth we conversed upon a variety of subjects we agreed to meet as a Quorum a week from tomorrow for prayer and fasting.

Brother Bigler had written a letter upon the subject said that Balantyne had taught that Haywood was the President of the place & that Balantyne had privately thaught the people that Brigham Young would bemassacreed bey the armey &c. The Twelve decided after Hearing the case that they would dismiss Elders Heywood & Balantyne from any further missionaryies duties at Present & G. A. Smith wrote to Bishop Bigler saying that the Twelve thought that He would have a more salutary influence with kind words

 February 19, 1859 ~ SaturdayFeb 19 The earth is coverd with snow this morning I spent the day on History I met with the board of Directors of the D. A. & M. society we regulated the premium list and appointed the committies over the various classesFebruary 20, 1859 ~ Sunday20th Sunday I attended meeting at the Tabernacle Jacob Gates spoke first & gave a good exertation & was followed by Elder O Pratt who spoke much to the Edefication of the peopleAt the close of the Meeting I met with my prayer circle A Hoagland prayed & J. C. Little was mouthI called upon President Young a short time E. T. Benson [FIGURE] C. C. Rich Erastus Snow came in. President Young said their was a Hand Bill stuck up in the city for a Ball with Thomas Williams Name to it, I have had a ticket or invi-tation to go to the Ball and it is rumoured that Col Johns-on would attend, but if Col Johnson waits for me to make a Ball and bear the expenses of it & invite him to in in order to see him He will wait a good while And if Col Johnson is the man I take him to be I do not think He will come over to Join these Rowdies in their Ball. There is many of this Church who does not know the diference between inviteing our Enemies, the Gentiles, ^or^ the wicked to Join in our feast or dances, or gioing to their parties & beingunder their dominion. If we invite a wicked man to our dance we preside over him. If we go to his party He presides over us and has an influence over us. If Col Johnson will stay whare he is and maintain his own GroupI have no objection I mean to stay whare I am and main-tain my own Ground by the help of the LordI met with the Twelve in the circle C. C. Rich prayed & E. T. Bensonwas mouth we made some arangments about prepareing fora Prayer & Fasting meeting of the Twelve ApostlesFebruary 21, 1859 ~ Monday21st Feb 1859 The Twelve Apostles met at the Prayer closit in the Historians office for Prayer & Fasting. There was Present O. Hyde O. Pratt W. Woodruff G. A. Smith E. T. Benson C. C. Rich Lorenzo Snow Erastus Snow & F. D. RichardsO Hyde opened by Prayer & spoke upon our position and the day in which we live said the gospel had been beging among the Gentiles for 30 years & he believed the time was soon over he believed the time [was] at hand when the Gentiles would beg for the GospelG. A. Smith Prayed in the spirit of the Lord and asked for all things necessary for the Church & kingdom of God the salvation of the Presidency, Twelve, our family & all Israel & the destruction of our Enemies We then sung come all ye that love the LordO pratt Prayed that the Holy Ghost might be poured out upon us, that our hearts might be filled with good desires that we might be taught to pray & what to ask of the Lord we then sung O our Father thou that dwellest 
 Feb 21stW Woodruff prayed and called upon the Lord to pour out his spirit upon us & give us the gifts of the Holy Ghost to Bless and preserve all Israel who would keep the comma-ndments of God & to curse & destroy our Enemies who wouldnot repent but seek our destruction We sung this Earth was once a Garden Place Erastus Snow spoke said he felt rather stupid but he hada great desire to enjoy the Holy spirit. He talked as stupidas he felt, and I thought rather Quenched the spirit, but he prayed and asked for many things which were goodO Pratt spoke and said that as Brother Hyde first remarked that in attempting to pray this morning his tongue was all doubled up and seemed hard work to speak O Pratt said that it made him think of Brother Whitmer before he saw theAngels he had to struggle hard with the powers of darknessand in one instance the Devel appeared in the form of a personage and he had to contend with that person & overcomehim, then an angel of God appeared to them Joseph said that Moses was visited by the Devil and He said to Moses son of Man worship thou me He told the Devil that He was a son ofGod and he would not worship him soon the Lord appeared to himC. C. Rich recommended that no one speak unless he hadthe spirit of God but to pray then we would have a good meeting several ingaged in the conversation.O. Pratt said there is one thing I think would be of advan-tage to us in prair the Lord has said that whare two or three agree as touching any thing it shall be given you He said we should cast in our minds what the spirit wouldwish us to ask for, then we should agree and all ask for thesame thing and exercise all the faith we could upon that one thing, now if we asked for a hundred things & all diferentit does not seem as likely to be answered as though we asked for a few things the Nephites when Jesus appeared to them asked for the Holy Ghost and it was given themO Hyde said the He must confess that he was more stupid & dull than He wished to be he thought it was in consequence of going without food & tobaco, which he had been in the habit of useing. He said if we get the spirit of the Lord & pray in the spirit we shall be agreed W. Woodruff spoke & said that we were living in an impo-rtant eria & that God required much at our hand as the Quorum of the Twelve Apostle, the Heavens were full of Judgment for the wicked & Blessings for the Righteous, and the Lord has said that He would be inquired off theby the House of Israel to [do thoes]Blessings for them we should be united in asking for what we want & we should go before God & ask him to stay our Enemies & hold them that they shall have no power over us we may 
 Feb 21stnot be confined to one thing we want the Holy spirit & we will ask for that and we will ask the Lord to Hold the congress of the United States & all our Enemis in that way that the will of Godmay be done He said this year would be more filled with Judgments upon the wicked than any year we have seen & 1860 will be far more so E. T. Benson said that He fasted 3 days and was blessed in intand thought we should not be discoraged but fast & Pray and ask the Lord for what you want. Now if we use coffee, tobaco whiskey, & stuff ourselves ^with^ meat we will be like the Gentiles & can-ot expect much of the spirit unless we prepare our bodies for it I believe that Good will grow out of this meeting G. A. Smith said that I understand the Idea of Brother Pratt is that we be united in what we ask for but not to limit us I know that we want the Holy spirit. And one of the GreatestGifts that we want is wisdom to help us to use the Holy spirit when we pray we want a gr[e]at deal of wisdom to know when to speak & when to be silent, as to the congress of the United States their is not ten men but what want to cut the throats of the Presidency & Twelve Apostles and I want to Pray God to curse them & give them No power over us & I want to pray for the removal of the armey. Joseph Smith wrote his ^dedication pray^ prayer & went and read it to the assembly & some were tryed with itWe all dressed in our robes. Lorenzo Snow prayed &F D. Richards was mouth and prayed long and asked for many things ^for^ the Church & Kingdom of God The Brethren then spent a short time in mixed conversation concerning the the death of Joseph & other things. we then adjourned till tomorrow 10 oclok, ^1/2 past 3^ I spent the evening at home I met in the evening with my family and taught them the things of the kingdom. Elder Lorenzo Snow spent the evening with me. The mail came in the eveningFebruary 22, 1859 ~ Tuesday22nd I called at the President's office in the morning to see theMail but few papers came in & not muchThe Twelve Met in the prayer closset at 12 oclok their being present O Hyde O. Pratt W. Woodruff John Taylor G. A. Smith E. T. Benson Lorenzo Snow, C. C. Rich Erastus Snow F. D. RichardsElder Taylor opened by Prayer and asked the Lord for all things nessary for the saints O Hyde wrote a note to H. C. Kimball giving him an invitactoon to meet with us we conversed upon variosus subjets till 1 oclok we then sung A poor wayfareing man of grief E. T. Benson Prayed & called upon the Lord for his Blessings upon all the Authorities of the Church and upon all Zion and for the Holy spirit to be poured oput upon us and for the Lord to hedge up the way of our Enemies that they shall have no power over us 
 22nd we then sunag come let us Anew our Journey persueO. Hyde Prayed in the spirit of the Lord and asked for evry blessi-ng upon the Church & Kingdom of God which the free spirit of the Lord dictated unto himErastus Snow spoke concerning the feelings of many of the people against seeing the Twelve prosper in Temperal thingsHe thought if the Lord did not sanction this, He permited it tobe & he thought perhaps it was not the will of God that we should [be] engaged in Temperal business when I was ordained BrotherBrigham told me to lay down my hoe & all farming tools & labouringin the ministry and I do not prosper in any temperal businessF. D Richards said he Brother Snow had spoken his feelingsexactly he did not feel like engaging in any temperal Business C. C. Rich spoke upon the same subject & said that He did notno as all the Twelve all experienced the same thing but I thinkthe people are exercised by a spirit othat they do not comprehendor know what it ment but their is an opposition to Joseph &the Presidency & Twelve against their prosperity. I think weshould use wisdom in the preservation of our bodies & lives wehave received a gospel and principles which will save us, butwe must apply it to our bodies as well as to our souls in the seasonthereof in [order] to be saved.Brother C. C. Rich called uponthe Lord in prayer and asked the Blessing of God upon us Lorenzo Snow spoke, was thankful to meet with us & whenHe herd of it thought he would undergo a great deal in orderto meet with us, if we did not have those great & marvellousthings that was manifest on the day of Pentecost yet it wasgood to meet & pray and while our Enemies are seeking ouroverthrow we should call upon God for our protection we are differently situated from the Ancient Apostles they hadnot the kingdom of God to build up as we have. Now the powerseems to be assimulated among the people & not confined to oneor two men or Twelve yet I consider Brigham Young isperforming a greater work in saving providing and orga-nizing his family, in the way he has than he would to dividethe waters, or heal the soals, cast out Devils, or do other miraclesand the wisdom of God is with him with regard to our atten-ding to temperal matters I think we shall have to attendto temporal matters & understand them in order to build upthe kingdom of God, I have no dout but that if BishopHunter would take care of our Families & we do nothing elsNo doubt we should be great & powerful men in spirit& make the hearts of men tremble & be filled with the powerof God but would this benefit the people more than for usto know how to teach the people in temperal things O Hyde said I have thought of the subject as Erastus spoke of but I have thought it was best for us to take a medium coursewe must have cares and if we could do as Bishop Hunterspoke of we might become dry & dull I believe we shall 
 have a variety sometimes fat & sometimes lean & sometimes nothing we shall have trials but I think we ought to do our duty  magnify our calling and trust in God and all will be rightI believe the day is not far off when the Twelve will haveall that is necessary. He related a dream about Bull[i]on &gold &c. J Taylor said I will prophesy that it shall befulfilled Lorenzo Snow said I will prophesy that the Moon ismade under which it shall be fulfilled. O Hyde said I willProphesiy that the time will soon come when we shall have allthat we want E. T. Benson asked how much wood O Hyde got at Sessionssettlement He said he had paid $5 for one load of maple woodof the Bishop that is all that I had in that settlement.we had a mixed conversation upon the subject before us we finallyconcluded to fulfill our mission ^first^ and be industrious and providedfor our families as well as we can & then trust in GodFebruary 23, 1859 ~ Wednesday23rd The Twelve met in the Prayer closset at the Historians Office at 1/2 [past] 120 there being present O.

The course was sustained by Joseph SmithHis instruction to the Twelve was read. B. Young saidthat when any one of the Twelve was abroad it was their duty to preside & regulate all thingsO Hyde Prayed in the spirit of the Lord and then spokesaid he wished the brethren would pray and aske for thosethings which we want & contend for it untill we obtainI feel as though we shall not always be kooped up hereI do not believe we shall always be together but theLord will call ous out we have a work to do in the Earththe Lord has said "with you I will rend their Kingdom,saidth the Lord" will this be done while we are here, wemust pray for the spirit of God to be with usAt a quarter to 12 oclck H. C. Kimball & D. H. Wells called* H. C. Kimball said this madtoe me think of the time whenI returned from England JosephJames [illegible]Foster ^was president^ & the presidency ofthe Seventies ^they^ had met with a seers stones to see what theycould see when I went in they treated me vary cool &Z Pulsipher said dont be excited Brother Kimball isNothing but a man, they treated me vary cooly & I wenthome and wept* The 12 all rose up & shook hands with them &recieved them JoyfullyO Hyde explained to Brothers Kimball & Wells what wehad done, and would like to hear from themBrother Kimball said I consider evry ruling man inthe Church that has the Holy Ghost is a prophet seer & Rev-elator & he should have the spirit of that office 
 Feb 23 G. A. Smith Read ^from the Doctrin & Covenants the duty^ the Authority of the Twelve Apostles Br Kimball said it was plain. The Nations were spoken of wharethe layws were so hard that the saints could not enjoy thegospel openly. F. D. Richards spoke of esstablishing severalBranches in Dresden in a secret manner through the mercyof God Brother Kimball conversed upon a variety of things referedto the stakes which the Twelve once set to see an Angel butwe did not seen an angel but prayed ourselves into darknessHe spoke of the time that Joseph tried the Twelve but theTwelve was united & tied Joseph down & Joseph said nowdont you now never let any body tie you down as you haveme. Brother Kimball said we appointed ^Joseph nominated^ G. A Smith totake the place of Thomas B. Marsh and Lyman Shermonwas appointed to take the place of Orson Hyde But BrotherSherman ^was vary^ was taken sick & died in 3 days ^shortly [illegible] after^ Brother G. A. Smithsaid when he heard of Brother Shermons death He thoughthis time would soon come. Brother Kimball said ["]it was notthe will of God for a man to take Brother Hydes place. TheTwelve can ordain men to the Apostleship and give themall the power you have and you have all that we have gotBut you cannot make a prophet ownly the natural wayand a man cannot be a patriarch & not a Prophet for a man may have the spirit of a prophet before he can blessand prophets [prophecy]" The gifts & callings of God are withoutrepentance there are thousands of prophets among the Gentilesand spiritualist that have not Repented or obeyed thegospel there are natural gifts to men if they wouldreceive the gospel their gifts would be made more manifestG. A. Smith Red some in the Doctrins & Covenants, H. C. Kimballsaid I always believed that Lyman Wight would be saved. Inever had any but good feelings towards himJoseph Young came in at 1 oclokPresident Brigham Young came in at a quarter past one oclokW Woodruff red the minutes. President Young saidBrother Box said the Armey was wanting to get up a viga-lance committee & wanted to get my head. But they willnot do it. well Brethren I called in to see you a minuteI supposed you called meet to gether to know more, well Iwish we all understood our calleding & ministry before God. At the time Brother Kimball speaks of the Twelve We praid untill it was so dark we could hardly see to get downstairs I then ^last time I met with the Twelve in Kirtland^ [I] praid to God with all my heart that I mightnever again meet with that Quorum and I never didI dont want you to run in to the same thing with the spirit they possessedBrethren I will say one thing to you that you should understandthat evry minute of our lives we should watch vary carefullyevry thought act and word in such a manner as not togrieve the spirit of God. I do not know how your feelingsare here but when you close you should ask what advantageit has been to you and if you have gained any ^thing by^ profit by itif you meet for past time to pray for your friends & Enemies thatis right, but if you meet to fast & pray & call upon the 
 Lord for special Blessings you will have to be vary careful notto indulge in light or vain conversation because it will grievethe spirit of the Lord. I met with the various quorums ofthe Church & many of the councils of the Church are like the door upon its hinges we are as we were, But we shouldimprove by every opportunity we have. He then left usBrother Kimball said as Brother Young has opened the way Iwill say the less you to meet to gether to talk over matters the lessbetter it will be for you, to meet & complain of one anotherand of the Presiden[c]y, or the people it is not profitable for you& if I had been in Brother Woodruff's Place I would not havered what he has I would not have written them.Brother Kimball said bear with me untill I get through andbe kind to me and I will be kind to you and if you will alwaystake my council you will find it will lead you into the kingdomof God & that you will not find in BooksThe Brethren spoke in social conversation upon a variety ofsubjects. Brother Hyde said I will remark concerning the objectof our meeting it was not to get cloven tungs to set upon us offire but it was to convers & pray together & ask the Lord topreserve us & to overthrow our enemies, we have stuck our stakebut was glad to have the Presidency come in with usH. C. Kimball said I will predict in the Name of Jesus Christif you will be one with the Head, the Presidency and sustain themand you will never see the Body of Christ moved or disturbedI do not mean members but the Body, untill the coming ofChrist and if you will be one with the Presidency not anyof you or the Presidency shall fall by the Armey or By theGentiles But you shall all be crowned in the presence of Godyou are connected with all the prophets and Apostles fromthe Begining and they are united with us and will sustainus if we do our duty, And we shall never be broaken upif we will be united all Hell cannot move us you unite withthe presidency and have an Eye to the head all the time, & sust-ain the Head & no power will prevail over us. I have the bestof feelings towards this Quorums if these two Quorums ownlyJust stands together the kingdom will stand and prospergo to and prune yourselves & begin at the root BrotherBrigham told it that we should not do any thing but whatwe know is rightBrother Wells said I rejoice to meet with you I was gladto hear that you was going to meet I feel like a little childamong you you have more experience than I have I offtenfell not qualifyed to fill my calling but by the grace of GodI fell to try to do my duty but one thing I no it is the workof God and if any of us get in the way it will rooll on withoutus for the Lord will carry it on. I have a great desire to havethe spirit of God so that evry act thought & word may be except-able before the Lord we should triy to healp Brother BrighamI have tryed to help him & have been called upon by him to domany things that I though[t] many others was Better Qualifyed 
 Feb 23to attend to But I have done it freely & for that things I believeit has [been] excepted I am thankful to see the Twelve & Presidencyso well united and the friendship & confidence the Twelve have in me this is our safe guard the devil has not the powerover us that many think when we are united we should tryto keep the devil out of our houses & out of ourselves sometimewe may have a member in our houses who will let the devildwell in their tabernacles we cannot always help this but ifwe are firm before the Lord we will gain ground untill wewill bind the devil and cast him out of our houses & finallyout of the church I feel to Bless you my Brethren this Quorumof the Twelve Apostles with evry feelings of my heart inthe Name of Jesus Christ and by all the Authority that God hasgiven me let us be up & doing & feed the flock of God thesaints are weak many of them, and are tempted & tryed & theywanted feeding & if you see any thing in me that is wrong Iwish you would come to me and tell me esspecially I should bemuch oblieged to you to tell me any fault before you tell anybody els. I consider it is a great blessings to belong to the Chiurch ofChrist I never did ask for any office in the Church of ChristI want to be passive in the hands of God. I never did have thosegreat manifestations that some have I have thought that Iwould like to have some of those manifestations if it was the will ofGod but not if it is agoing to do me any harm I would not wishto see an Angel or hear the voice of God if it would make meapostitize or do me an injury but let us act for to day &we will have all the Blessings that is necessary for usO Hyde said I believe & I may almost say I know that there is not a feeling among the Twelve against the Presidencyand do not offerd up a prayer without asking God to Bless the presid-ency & call them by name.The question was asked had wenot better met hear evry thursday to fast. Brother Kimballsaid I thing if you will meet with the people you will havemore of the spirit of God than to meet herePreside[n]t Kimball dismissed us and Blessed us in the name of JesusChrist and said we should be blessed and the spirit of good shouldbe with us and be with our wives, and it should rest uponthe Earth around about us and these are the begining of GoodBetter daysFebruary 24, 1859 ~ Thursday24th A cold wind I spent the fore part of the day in the office we read G.

 March 30, 1859 ~ WednesdayMarch 30thBrother Meeks got in from Provo last night reported that the Judges & Armey were vary mad at the Extra. The proc-lamation had Just arived but not circulated when he left. They had privately examined Durfee and he hadtried to implicate President Young and this is what ourEnemies have been triying to hier some one to do a longtime. But their is not a man in the world who can sware in truth that President Young advised anyone to murder any body he has always advised evry man when he has advised at all not to shed Blood except in self defence. It is a vary cold day I wrote some todayto Lorenzo Snow. It is rumoured to day that Col Johnson has 100 deserters in Irons in his camp and he had one man whiped 120 lashes on the bare back who swore hewould kill the man who sentenced him to be whiped as soon as he got a chance, we learned that the snow was vary deep south and their had been No communication with any settlement south of Fillmore for several weeksI had two dreams last night. I dreamed of having a terrible[FIGURE] battle with a rattle snake he tried to bite me all over but did not seem to hurt me after I awoke I again fell [FIGURE] asleep & and dreamed that I had an orchard of severalacres of Appletrees and I thought the ground was covered with vary large red ripe Apples I thought there washundreds of Bushels so ripe that they must be used upin order to save them I was making preperations tomake them into cider when I awoke. An express came inlast night bringing the reports of the court they are mad at the governors ProclamationMarch 31, 1859 ~ Thursday31st I herd the report of the doings of the court Judge Cradlebaugh threatened to arest Gov Cummings they came near a collission some boys threw stones at the centinels they reported that to the com-mander [who] gave orders oif any more was flung to fire in the directionand if the fire was returned to kill all the prisioners immediatelyit seems a difficult matter to keep from having a collision between the citizens and troops.[FIGURE] I attended the funeral of Sister Woolley. A large congre-gation assembled, there was also President H. C. Kimball& D H Wells presient also O Pratt W Woodruff J. TaylorG. A. Smith E. T. Benson & Erastus Snow, also Bishop HunterHunter & many Bishops & Elders they sung "O My Father thou that dwellest." O Pratt Prayed. Another Hymn was sungElder O. Pratt then addressed the People. And said whatI may say I do not know, but I hope I may be led to say what will be for the best. Since I came here my eyes havebeen saluted with one thing, and that is that death has powerover all things that we see. we are called upon to part withour best friends and have them taken away from us what we now see in death, and what has happened from the Beginningin like manner will all the millions who now dwell upon the whole Earth will be called to pass through the same change. If we had no knowledge of God we should feel vary diferent from what we now do. If we thought our bodies would lie in the dust andnever be raised again we should have great cause to mourn 
 March 31stbut we have learned that the being which inhabits this Tabernacle will live forever and not die. we have to lay our tabernaclesin the dust but they will again be resurrected with an immor-tal body for Jesus Christ through his death and sufferingsrestored unto all the children of men the privilege of the resurrec-tion of their bodies, and if we keep a celestial law we shallhave a celestial Resurrection but all the righteous & the wickedwill have their bodies again. we cannot imagin the greatnessof the glory of the saint of God after the resurrection. Notwithstandingall that our bodies suffer in this life in pain sorrow & distress the want of food &c still we cling to them and do not wish togive them up. we do not realize the great difference there is inbeing in this world or probation & the next all the knowledge weformerly had was taken from us when our spirits took these bodies some think we never did exist till we came here becausewe cannot remember any thing neither can we remember any thing of the first year or two of our existence yet our spiritsremained in our bodies as much as they do now but as soon as our spirits leave these imperfect tabernacles or rather bodiescloged with mortality & evil our spirits will be in lively reco-llection of evry thing that took place with us before we came here and all things appertaining to us since we came in thisworld. It is right for us to take proper care of our bodies and do right & when we have done that we should leave all in the hands of God and not be over anxious for our lives for if we arefaithful I expect we shall be raised in the morning of the first Resurrection. And if we expected to be crowned Kings and Priests & sit upon thrones we want experience in this world and the next in order to be prepared for thes things. If we were to be judged by the knowledge we once had before we camehere it would not be right, for we have to be judged accordingto the light we have and if we break the Law of God after having received great light and knowled[ge], our condemnation wouldbe accordingly. when the righteos come forth with their resur-rected bodies, they will have great Joy in the remembrance of their faithful deeds while the wicked will have greatsorrow in the rememberence of their wicked deeds, & the persecu-tion of the saints, their sorrow will be increased a thou-sand fold while the Joy of the saints will be a thousand foldIt has been thought by some that when the spirit leaves thebody that will never be called upon to labour either befor or after the resurrection, but I believe that all the children ofGod will be called to perfore duties through all Eternity asgreat as they are capable of performing, that they maycontinue to receive the blessings of their Father in heavenThose who lived and died before the coming of Christ who were faithful received their resurrected Bodies after Christ arose and if you are faithful you will also have your resurrected bodies at the second coming of Christ and when we come to meet with them we can then tell our labours & toils over together each in their generation, and if they had persecution so have we, and if they were driven fromtheir homes & had perils for Christ sake so have [we] and wecan be mutual in our communication together 
 March 31And the Zion on the Earth will ere long metet with the Zionof Enoch and there we will greet each other and we shallhave such Joy as we have never seen on the EarthPresident Heber C Kimball then spoke a short time He saidin regard to what had been said by O. Pratt is all good.In regard to the abobe [abode] of departed spirits I have no doubtbut this wourld will stand forever. Jesus says in this worldye have tribulation but in me ye have pease, But I am goingto say a few words about Sister Mary W Woolley, we callher dead she is dead in one sense, but not ^in^ another. I haveknown her before she was in the church, she is a good womanshe has always stood by her husband and has been true tohim and if she has been true in this life she will be inthe next and have her reward which will be the case inthe next probation with all. I believe in many ProbationWhen Sister Woolley gets in the next probation she willsit down with Sarah and the ancient Holy woman as wellas the Prophets and Apostles who have lived in this probation when they go into the spirit world they sit down withAbram and the Patraiarchs and Prophets. She has hadmany troubles in this life but she has got through themall and I am confident she will sit down with all theHoly men & women in the Eternal world. and will remain with them Eternally. what she has past throughshe has done for salvation and she has stood it well andnow has gone to rest, and I can say of a truth that I knowthat she is now well off and all is well off with her. She hassustained Brother Woolley in carrying out the doctrin of the Patriarkal order of marriage and this because God hadHad commanded it we have often herd President Young saythat He did not enter into it because he likied it but becauseGod had commanded it. If we had not done it we should havebeen damed. He commanded Law Marks & others to enter into itbut they did not obey the word of the Lord and they have goneand denied the faith while we remain and God will sustainus here in the mountains, true yes it is as true as the sun,and those who are faithful will be saved sister woolleyhas been true and so has Brother Woolley and their sonsand daughters have been true men and women andI say God Bless you Brother Woolley and your familyand I Bless you all that are faithful But a curse will come upon the Nation that has sought our destructionand as God lives what the nation seeks to bring upon uswill be brought upon them so we must be patient, the Lord has them in his power and they cannot move ownlyas the Lord permits and God will regard all that we havedone in the Temple of God and we will have to fully carryit out and if we have not done wrong or broaken our covenants we shall receive all that has been promised untous and all will be right And may God grant that all maycome upon our Enemies that the Lord may wish to bringupon them.

Soon capt A. B. Miller of the firmof Wardle, Russell, Miller, &c called in to see President Young & had quite a long interview with him. He said there were two & a half Millions of Dollars worth of goods at First cost on the road for this market there is morethan 1000 waggons loaded with merchandize with 2 1/2 tons to the waggon. I think there is more than one million dollars worth of good more than can be sold inthis market for the next year. The western Merchants havebeen anxious to sell goods to come to this Market for they paid up so well last year but they will not be as anxious to sell to the transient Merchants next year for it will be a long time before they will get their pay & I expect we shall have to buy out the Merchants in this City before they get through There is a vast amount of Cattle, Horses, Mules, waggons, goods & people on the way to this Territory. Cattle will be cheap this fall, though many young cattle will bedriven through to Calafornia. Mr Miller said the people estimated that the mormon Emigration alone will be 25000. President Young said he did not think there would be 1000 Mormons, an Indians said all the white men East were going to Utah. they pulled up some grass & asked the Indian if he could tell whare it come from ior if He would miss it from the field of grass before him. He said No they told him it was so with the white men they werenot missed whare they came from. Mr Miller thought Mr Livingston Bell & Co. will loose some $20,000 $30000 or their contract on Flour. President Young thought not, that theywould by their flour for goods at a high price & would probably samve themselves. Mr Miller said that much flour would 
 July 1stbe wanted ^He wanted^ flour to feed about 1500 men mostly at Bridger, manymen who are on the way to Calafornia will come through hereto get their flour. Mr Miller says that all Freight cannow bye carried from St Louis to St Joseph either via RailRoad or Steemer for 15 cents per hundred He said that a railroad would be in operation to Kansas City in two yearsPresident Young said Mr Miller perhaps you can informthe people whether the Armey in this Territory belongs toMajors Russell Miller & Company, or the United States formany people are at a loss to know who it belongs to. Mr Miller Did not answer Direct. President Young asked if they were going to let us live a little longer here. Hesaid yes the army will be reduced to 1000 men by fallwe must keep them moving to keep money stiring. PresidentYoung said there is going to be a great sale of Mules they will be sold cheap & go out bought back deear. Miller Noddedassent. Presidet Young said I under stand that you broughtword that Stephen A Duglass stands Fair to be the candidatefor the next President. Miller said He was sure to be thenext President the South has to unite on him to get votesin the north so as not to get Defeted. If he is PresidentI shall do business in this line for 5 years then I will quit but Wardle will remain in Washington to regulateaffairs there & attend to business. He said they had gotthe contract of carriying the Utah & Calafornoia Mail & hasthe whole controll of it & all the government transportation forthe army. After some other Remarks Mr Miller tookhis leave.After he left President Young Remarkedthat I cannot tell what to believe by what Mr Millersays, He talks so much he does not expect to be believedin all he says, He has a motive in view in calling here hewants to lay a plan to make our boys his servants incarrying the mail if Wardle Majors & Co tell the Army tomove to any place they will move for that company has all the power in their hands except the buying of the flourMr Miller Further said that Just before I left we received2nd A telegraphic Dispach not to organize 1500 larg freidt [freight]waggons for Utah & New Mexico we sent word that theywere to late for we were already organized Mr Russell went immediately to washington to see what was upJuly 2, 1859 ~ Saturday2nd S.

A. Smith & A Lyman took the stage for the SouthCountry at 8 oclok this morning I spent the morningin wattering I went to the office at 11 oclock I met withElder Danea C. R. Dana He had made a statement whilein England to Orson Pratt that when my life was preserved on the night of the 5 day of July 1848 by moving my carriage from an impression which I had to moveit, also to move my mules from an oak tree standingbeside the road, Both of which I done (see my Journalof July 5 1848) He says that He had the impression &urged me during the afternoon several times to do ithe also sayes that my mules were turned out & not atthe tree both of these statements are incorrect acor-ding to my best knowledge & belief & recollection & theaccount of my Journal, & testimony of my Journalwritten next morning & testimony of my wife &Dominicas Carter, both of which were present, I toldBrother Dana that I considered his statement nottrue I havd no recollection of his saying any thingabout it untill I named it to him, and I knew Imoved my mules from the tree & tied them in aHickory grove whare I found them in the morningHe had been to the trouble of making a New Journalwhare he had detailed the account at great lengthapparently to esstablish his version of the story But I am of the impression that he has told the story so often that He received a Revelation by which my lifewas preserved that He either believes it to be trueor wishes to try to maintain what what He has statedso often. He did not move the waggon in which he slephimself and the tree fell in about 1 foot of it, I feltthankful to the Lord for preserving my life & I wishto give Brother Dana all the credit which belong to himin the affair But I have No recollection of his sayinga word about it to me untill I named it to himNeither has any one who was with me any recollectionof it this I told him & we parted both of firm in our own belief I spent the afternoon in the office

H Stout asked President Youngs council. He said He did not wish to talk about it but said The Lawyiers were not required 
 July 11by any law to go to that camp & he should not do it & if He was his Lawyier he should advise him to let the Judges do as they pleased at the examination & if I was in his place I would Neither Deny nor Confess any thing but would remain silent. if he is guity he ought to be Cuffed for I have employed him for 2 years & paid him & helped his family & for such a man to ingaged in such a business I feel like spanking him they seek evry opportunity to Hatch up an accusation against me. If MCKinzie will tell the truth it will be all right as far as I am concerned But if my enemies can get him to lie against me or anybody els so they can make a war on me then their will be a fight on hand and this will be as soon as the Lord willBrother Hosea wrote to MCKinzie that the holding of a court at Camp Floyd in a military camp was illegal & contrary to the instructions of Judge Black & President Bucannan I shall not come to plead any cause in that campA man called upon President Young & informed him thathe had found a good bed of stone colal on the Webber from 4 to 10 miles above the mouth of echo canyon He found three veins of the coal about 3 feet each & the man is an old col[yier ]He ingaged to deliver to President Young 100 tons of coal at $20 per tonJuly 12, 1859 ~ Tuesday12 President Young called into [Co&] Commission RoomE.

President Young dreamed a few nights since that He saw those Judges drunk & they behaved as ^bad as^ they could evry thing they done was dirty and filthyThe Probate court has been in session about four weeks and Adjourned to day senedi. I spent the day in the officeJuly 13, 1859 ~ WednesdayJuly 13th I went over Jordon & staked out my grass ground & went to the office at 1 oclock I found President Young& D H Wells in the office President Young invited meto meet at his House at 2 oclok as He was going to havean interview with Horace Greely I met agreeable to invitation I Found Mr Greely A singular looking man He was midling well dressed white but bald Headed his head vary dirty looked as though He had not washed his Head since He came off the plains He had quite a feminine soft green appearance He asked many Question 
 July 13thQuestions Asked By Horace Greely & Answered By Brigham YoungAt 2 oclock P.M. The following Persons met at President Youngs upper Room Lion House in the Mansion B Young H. C. Kimball D H. Wells J. M. Bernhisel W Woodruff S M Blair H StoutA Carrington, J. Ferguson Elias Smith, & Horace Greely Editor of the Tribune when the following conversation took place after the company was introduced to Mr Greely by the Hon J. M. Bernhisel. Also Joseph & Brigham Young Jr wasintroduced But they soon left. Mr Greely asked President Young what is the difference between your religion & Churchfrom the Christian world. B. Y. The difference between us isthat we believe that No Church is the Church of God who has not the Holy Priesthood. We have the Priesthood & thesects of the day have not got it. The Lord has delivered the Priesthood unto us & without the priesthood no man has auth-ority to administer in the ordinances of the gospel. G do you believe in faith & what is it" B Y We do. Paul said it was the substance of things hopede for & the evidence of things ^not seen^hoped for. G. What do you Believe about slavery. B. Y. We believe what the Bible sayes about it, there was a curse put upon Cain & his seed & that curse will remain untill it wais taken off they were to be servants. G is this a slave territory or are there slaves here. Y There is slaves here or have been from time to time. G Then this would become a slave statewould it not if it was admitted. Y. No the climate & situ-ation would not admit of it. slavery is a thing I do not want any thing to do with it. I consider it more of acourse [curse] to a man to have slaves than a Blessing. G So I think. do you tithe the people if so what for. Y. Yesone tenth to Build Temples, & to Feed the poor, and I want you to understand one thing & I want you to writeit just as I tell you & that is I do not have so much as one cabbage or ear of corn of the tithing ownly whatI pay for. G Do you have a salary. Y. No sir not one cent. G Then how do you get your living. Y I would think myself a poor financeer if I could not work for Nothing & keep myself. There is No man from theHighest to the lowest in the Church that Has a salary. The Presidency Twelve, Seventies & all the Elders who labour for the interest of the Church do it without a salary the Elders travel the world over as it were & go without purse or scrip or money & all preach without a salary. While building a Temple in Kirtland we had a committee of three who spent there whole time they were allowed $1 per day each man. We had a committee of three in building the Nauvoo Temple they had $2 per day each. We I do not noknow of any other who have a salary. Joseph Smith on[c]e gave H. C. Kimball credit of $2 on Book for some labour. Brother Kimball had it taken off said he would not have a credit for it. We have appointed a committeof one Mr D H Wells here to superintend the buildingof a Temple here. He has No salary. I prefer a committe 
 July 13 of one instead of any more to transact any kind of businesif I want to do it with dispatch then he does not haveothers to council but can act upon his own judgmentwe hire men ^& clerks^ to work in the Church who spend all thertime as day labourers we pay them wages. G. Do notthe Bishops have salary's Y. No Sir. [G.] Are all the Mormonsunder obligation to gather together and upon what principlare they required to gather. Y Yes we considerourselves under obligation to gather together By the comma-ndments of God the Bible teaches the subject of the Gatheringin the last days. G we have understood that the Bibleteaches the Jews to gather to old Jerrusalem Y. Yes &it also teaches the Saints to gather to Zion. G Do you think there can be any collission between the Mormons& the United States. Y Not if they let us alone & do notpersecute us more than we are able to bear, but they cancroud us to a point which would make a collission[G.] What was the cause of so much oposition to Joseph Smiththey accused him of stealing Horses & cattle & doing muchEvil. Now the Methodist used to be much opposed &were vary unpopular But I do not recollect of hearingthem accused of such crimes as the Mormons areI am vary unpopular in my religion I am a wholesouled Universalist yet we are not accused of suchcrimes & I do not recollect that the Saints were in thedays of Christ. B. Y I think sin if you will look carefully at the History of Christ & the Apostles you will find that all manner of Evil was spoken against them falsly. As to Joseph Smith he was a good man& he was persecuted even unto death becasuse he diddo good. He passed through over 30 law suits got upby his enemies & it was shown in evry instace thatHe was innocent & it was got up through persecutionG What are the Danites and what information can yougive me concerning them. Y I cannot give you any information conserning them you will have to enquiringof our Enemies & they can tell you all about it, we know nothing about any Danites we have no such society orcompany among us. G You are accused of many crimesY And so were the saints in the days of Christ & the Apostlesevry exertion has been made from the begining to Bring someaccusation against us while trying Joseph in Missouri beforeJudge A King. He asked Joseph if he believed in the setlingof the kingdom in the last days that the prophet Daniel spokeof Joseph said he believed what the Bible said about it theJudge said clerk put that down that is treason Col Dona-phan who was Josephs Lawyier said you had bettermake the bible treason & don with it. In the days of Christthe Jews said if we let him alone he will come & take awayour state & Nation that is what our enemies are afraidof now that we shall esstablish the Kingdom of GodG do you believe in infant sprinkling. Y. No we baptizeBelievers By ememersion. G do you believe in any New 
 July 13new doctrin Y no none ownly what the Bible & Book of mormonteaches, have you not read the Book of Mormon G But vary little of it. How extensive are miracle in the Church & are they confined to the leaders of the Church. Y They are asextensive as it is the will of God to give they arne not confinedto the Head But all Elders lay hands upon the sick when called upon and the sick are often healed. G yes but somedie I suppose. Y Yes the saints & sinners have died inevery age. Death has passed upon all mankind & they cannotescape it. G Your doctrin of Polygamy is not that against the Bible. Paul said A Bishop should have one wifeY. that is correct Doctrin you should not take a singleman for a Bishop he should at least have one wife ButPaul did not say that he should not have but one thereis nothing in Pauls words against his having a dozen[G.] How many wives has any one man had in the ChurchB. Y. I suppose I have as many as any one man I havesome 15 I have some aged women sealed to me upon theprinciple of sealing which I no more think of makinga wife of than I would my Grand Mother. G Has it been long that Poligamy has been practiced in the ChurchY it has ben practiced for some 16 years have you not readthe revelation given upon that subject G I have not I thinkit has not been published till late. Did Joseph Smith havemore than one wife. Y The revelation was publishisin Aug 1852. Joseph Smith had more than one wifeG How do the women receive the Doctrin Y Quite aswell as the men. I do not think there is a woman in theChurch that opposed it inmore than I did in my feelingsHow many wives have you Mr Greely. G ownly oneH. C. K. How many Misses do you keep. G Not any.B Y I do not think their is a member of the Church in this room that has had any connexion with a woman except hiswife if Mr Greely can say as much, then I think you are virtuous. (He did not answer it) G. I would like to visit your schools while here do you have free schools do theChurch pay for the schooling of all the children Y No allpay their own schooling at present. G I hear that the Church is rich. Y The Church have some buildings hereG While Journeying here it was reported that the animalsof the emigrating trains belonged to the Church. Y The[y] arenot Church animals they belong to members of the Churchprobably. G. Were not the leaders of the Church poor yousay you have no salary. you seem to be wealthy I do not seehow you get your property B. Y. I gathered some propertyin kirtland. I earned it with my hands except half of a pig which weighed 90 lbs which Joseph Gave me wehad to leave kirtland through persecution I came toNauvoo with nothing I there got a property throughmy labor & the Blessings of God. We were driven from our property there & I had to Borrow to get here & now my Property I suppose is worth some three hundred thou-sand dollars and you may ask any man in heavenEarth or Hell, if I have wronged him out of a dollar 
 July 13and if you can find such a man I will make it rightI have wronged No man I have paid for what I havehad as I have said I do not have as much as an ear ofcorn out of the tithing office ownly what I pay for I Borrowedmoney to help the poor when I came here and I wantyou to write my statement as I give it for it is true as the Son. I financeer my affairs according to the wisdom God has given me & I trust to him & he alone givesme my increase. there isare fears here that there willnot any potatoes grow I shall look for potatoes when itis time to dig them I do so with all my business theLord kan make me rich or poor Just as he pleasesI care not a groat for all the gold & silver in the worldand Jesus Christ did not. G. The leaders of the Churchmust have some advantage the city lots here sold for someprice did it not go to the leaders of the Church. Y No all the setlers paid for their city lots was $1.50 $1 to the surveyor Mr Sherwood & 50 cts to Thomas Bullock therecorder. G How do you get farmes here. Y Theland belongs to the United States and all the claim setlershave is possession and improvements when men take up unsurveyed lands they pay the surveyors fees & whenthey buy improvements they pay for them accordingto there value. & what they produce all men like to speculate more or less & men are apt to get what theycan. G I calculate that I am about the ownly manwho speculates who has not bought some land in the wes-tern country, or a city lot, many who have speculatedin land have become poor.You have had two or threesplit off's. How do you consider them. Y. The same asall apostates. G Do the Bishops make Bishops or how is itdone. Y The people meet in conference and if they wanta man to preside over them as a Bishop they vote for himand he is ordained a Bishop to preside over them.G Can the people reduce a Bishop to the layity Y. Thepeople can remove a Bishop from presiding over them by a vote & chuse the one they wish. G who is the Presidentof the Church. Y you know that I am the Presidentof the Church. I have my two councellors Mr Kimball& Wells here are my councellors. Then we have TwelveApostles & Seventies & various Quorums in our organizat-ion G My neighbors religion does not trouble me anyhow & I see no particular harm in your religion andI am glad to learn so much from you about the rulemanagement, & organization of your Church I now [k]now much more about your Church than I ever havebefore. How many clergy men of other sects have Joinedyour Church. Y not a great many & they are not oftenworth much when they do Join. For the clergy menDoctors & Lawyiers make about as poor Saints as any class of men we have for they do not like to work much & the mormons work for a living and I believe I am aboutthe ownly man who does not work. G I think there 
 July 13is not many Editors come among you by the looks of thepapers published here. Y No and if they should we should be careful not to Employ them to publish for usG I think it would be a good plan to sow the Canida thistleall over the sage plains & deserts it would renevate the soil & make food for cattle. Y if that is your opinionpray dont tell the people of it for you could not introducea worse plague if the people was ^to^ introduce Canida Thistlesit would come Nearer to driving out the mormons from the country than any elsthing els. they would ruin any countryG O I think they would be a great Benefit & if they gotinto your grass & farming land you can eisily kill them bymowing & salting them. Y I think not. G I think theArmy was sent here esspecially for your Benefit & theBenefit of Wardle & Russel, you are getting rich through the army. Y The people are making money from that sourcethey introduce money, cattle, waggons Horses & Mules. The people buy the waggons for the Irons for $15 or $20 of the largest class, containing some 6 or 800 lbs whichis quite a help to the country where Irons is scearce G.The whole country is lined with Iron. there is many miles of chains & if I lived in the country I would pickit up & cash it. Y The Government would claim itG I would give them so many days Notice then to take it out of the way & if they did not do it I would takeit myself. There is more good timber in one of thoselarge freight waggons than grows in this whole TerritoryI dont believe in your having a Famine or that thereis going to be any Famine Y what do you refer to. G I see it published in the Deseret News. Y. yes you refer toOrson Hydes Famine sermon. G We had 2 frost in thestates & it was reported that evry thing was killed on the 11th June in the North But I do not think that thefrosted district was vary extensive. [Y.] We are improving evry year in agricultural, pursuits & when we get all the Dr& Lawyiers to work we shall raise all you want. I dontthink we shall have any Famine. I have travelled throughmany parts of Europe they are capable of raising muchfood, I think Lombardy with its irrigation is the richest part of Europe. [G.] Mr Young I shall have to state in my report that I consider your system of poligamy is reducingthe female Here to the oriental state I see no chance for thefemale here for her to develop herself, I see no Female signsout in this city I see no chance for a woman ownly to bea first or fifteenth wife. Y A woman here has all the chance or liberty here to develop her talent or capabilities of doing good & filling her sphere that she has in any countryBut I do not want any woman to council & dictate mein the direction of my affairs if I did I should think I ought to have been made a woman G I dont care whethera person is man or woman I think they should have the priv-lege of Developing their Talent, it is well enough for awoman to bear children But I think they ought to rulewhen they are capable of it. Queen Elizabeth was the greatest 
 July 13Ruler England Had And Catherine was one of the greatest Sovreigns of Russia But Poligamy I think has a tendency to bury up the talent of women H. C. K. is it worse to be a mans secondwife than to be a horewhore G I dont know that it is.Here Mr Greely closed his interigations. Took hishat Bowed to the company & retiredAfter Mr Greely left conversation turned upon the oppositi-on of our enemies President Young said the Lord has said he would fight our Battles & give us the victory & he has done it thus Far. Should the Lord say now draw the sword & fightmany would cut their way through an Enemy & turn around & fight over the spoil. this would gratify two manyevil hearts and that would not do President Kimball saidGod holds Gov Cummings to do his will for us if He was toleg go of him he would be our bitter EnemyJuly 14, 1859 ~ Thursday14th I spent the forepart of the day in the office the afternoon in getting HayJuly 15, 1859 ~ Friday15th I spent the day in the office in the after noon I called upon President Young & red to him my report of his interview with Mr Greely. He was pleased with it, it met hisapprobation. I also red it to D. H. Wells in the Historiansoffice [FIGURE] I wrote a Letter to G. A. SmithJuly 16, 1859 ~ Saturday16th I spent the day hoeing sugar cane & corn I attendeda meeting of the Typhographical Society at the Counceil HouseMr Horace Greely was present the meeting was got up for hisspecil Benefit there was quite a room full of Brethren& sisters, and a Band of music. after a few tunes by the Band & a short Prayer By Gilbert Clements we herd a speech from Mr Horace Greely & I must say thatI was entirely disappointed in the man I was asstonished at his speech, &language, & appearance. he appeared far morelike a clown of the lowest grade than he did like a man of letters, ability, & extensive influence & a conducter of one of the most popular Journals in the NationI was at a losts to know whether he was playing the possumor had lost his senses. He appeared to me like a man who had accidentelly stumbled into notiriety popularity& wealth,. for neither his head, Phisiognomy, looks, acts, or speech indicated indicated in the least a man of knowledge, refinement talent, influence or ability sufficient to edit a Tribune his speech was reported byG. D. Watt I did not take minutes it is true there was some sense in what He said but the language he used& his manner of speaking nearly destroyed all interestin the sentiments advanced. He commencd in a whine-ing drawing out of his words in a vary flat manner in a babiyish stile as though he had neither a knowledge of language or Grammar while at the same time we mustbe fully aware that he is vary proficient in both for He has Edited & conducted the Tribune the most popular& widest circulated paper in America for more than 
 16thirty years. He commenced by saying Mr President Gent-lemen & Ladies I am happy to meet with you here to nightesspecially to see so many females I havent seen a womanbefore since I have come into this ere place not that belong tothis people & I dident expect to see one while I was herewell I do declair I am glad to see so many women here to night I thought I was ownly going to meet a few poor printers. I dident expect to see any women at all But I expect you are connected in the printing business in some way or other. The printers talked of gitting me up a dinnerwell I decair I thought it was to hot to Eat dinnersmuch I could get along without any dinner & with but a poor Breakfast if I could ownly in the morning take up a News paper & read what all the world had done the day before & gess what they would do todayI could get along with the loss of all the luxeries that you are deprived of if I could have a telegraph wire that would tell me all that was going on in all the worldHe confined his speech to the printing business telegraphwire & the improvements of the day told how long he had been in the printing business the improvements that had beenmade in that art since He commenced He know had a stea[m]press that could print 20000 sheets per hour & should notbe satisfied untill he could put on one ton of paper in one continues rooll onto his cilender & print 40000 sheets per hour & fold, cut, & direct them by steam which improvement he was sure would soon come in use He was followed byElder O Hyde who spoke upon a variety of subjects & belie-ved in a telegraph wire which would reach from heavento Earth so we could get revelation of God from heaven &other world. Elder John Taylor followed & spoke of many things & of the conduct of the Judges in this TerritoryGilbert Clements spoke also John Banks. James MCknight red to Mr Greely a poem from Mr. Lions welcomeingMr Greely He flourished a candle with such velosityaround Mr Greely's head that I think he left a sprink-ling of spearm upon his close Brother Dunbar sun a song Brother Mabyan sung a song about the man that could never get warm and at 11 oclok they adjourned to theGlobe to take Ice Cream &c but I returned home & did not attend.July 17, 1859 ~ Sunday17th Sunday I met with my Quorum in the morningA.

 warfare all night He is easier this morning. We got word this morning from [FIGURE] the Hand Cart company that they will camp to night at killions at the foot of the Little Mountain many of them are frozen their fingers & toes are droping off & flesh droping off their bones it has been vary bad management in starting out Companies so late upon the plains. Brothe Decker came in last night He brought in the express He says that the ox trains cannot even get to Bridger they sent in for 40 tons of flour the cattle are dying & also the people there has never been so much suffering among any people as their is this season it is truly deploriable.

I called upon President Young at his office He had been down to lay hands upon president J. M. Grant who lay vary low his lungs appeared to fill & no power to raise any thing from his Lungs it appeared as though he could not live but a short time unless there was a change soon for the better. He said he felt as though He wanted an apple some grapes or wine or sumthing upon his subject stomach President young sent him down some & they rosted an apple & he eat it about 12 oclok & seemed to relish it well He also drank some butter milk which he relished well. but it seemed to be sumthing like a death Apetite [FIGURE] The missionaries met at the Historians office soon President Young came in & opened the meeting with prayer F. D. Richards made a short report or address & was followed by W. Woodruff who expresedsed his feelings in great plainness concerning this people taking of[f] from the president a part of the burthen which is resting upon him for he was wearing out.

Richards & myself started down to see how President Grant was I met Dr S. L. Sprague who informed me that He was dead had Just breathed his last we immediately went into the House & found his wives & Children weeping bitterly[FIGURE] President Jedediah Morgan Grant Died Dec 1st 1856; 20 minuts past 10 oclok PM Aged 40 years 9 months & 7 days.J. C. Little L. W. Hardy D. H. Wells George Davisson Grant & Dotctors S L Sprague Israel Ivins & Dunyon was standing around his body as I gazed upon his claye Tabernacle without his spirit I felt to exclaim A mighty man in Zion is laid low A valiant man in Israel has fallen I felt that a great champeon in the kingdom of God was taken 
 from us we felt his loss deeply for two months it seems as though he had been hurried to close up his work He has been preaching for several months callingupon the people to repent his voice has been like the Trump of the Angel of God & he has laboured night & day untill He was laid prostrate with sickness He has shot the arrows of the Almighty with great power among the people. He Called at the Historians office on the 19th Nov the last time He was out. He was then sick. He was confined to his house 10 days before he died He had a great vision while He was sick which he told to the brethren he preached nearly all the time that He was sick & he related all that he saw in the spirit worldSoon after I entered his house his wife Rosetta was seized with great trembling & nervous excitement & it seemed as though her frame would shake to peices we lade hands upon her & rebuked the Devil which seemed to sieze her tabernacle & she became more calm.I assisted Dr Dunyon inlaying out the body of Brother Grant I spent the night with himDecember 2, 1856 ~ Tuesday2nd I left Brother Grants family a short time in the morning called upon capt Hooper found him quite sick I administered unto him then I went to my house got a piece of fine linen & Mrs Woodruff accompanied me to Brother Grants I gave them the linen to make a garment & Robes to lay out the body in. I went to President Youngs to get Zina Young to go down & help make the Robes she gave me a seat President Young came in & spoke of Brother Grants Death said we had done all we could to save his life but the powers the other side of the veil were stronger than we were & he was wanted there. Sister Zina Young walked with me to President Grants & spentthe day with the sisters in makeing the robes. I felt sick & went home & went to bed & was sick through the day. Leo Hawkins started for Filmore todayDecember 3, 1856 ~ Wednesday3rd I spent most of the day writing the Obituary of J. M. GrantDecember 4, 1856 ~ Thursday3rd4th [FIGURES] At 9 oclok preperations were made for the Funeral of J. M. GrantThe doors of the House was flung open for the people to visit the corps many thousands went through the House to visit the body at half past 9 the Military began to form in open lines from the residence to the Tabernacle 3 bands of Music were in attendance. The Lieutenant General & staff, General Grant staff & Lancers were in attendance & a company of York masons formed in the posse procession the corps was removed to the tabernacle & the House filled up & many that could not get in. But it took so long to get through with the ceremonies of the Morning that it was 10 minuts to 12 oclok when President Brigham Young arose to speak as it was so late He did not speak but a short time & said He did not answered his mind but his remarks were vary interesting & instructive at the close of the meeting the procession was formed & the corps conveyed to the grave followed by the largest procession ever formed on such an occasion in this valley. at the Grave President Young made some remarks He said we have no cause to mourn for Brother Grant and you have made a far greater display here than was necessary for more so than Brother Grant would have wished & a far greater display than I wish you to make over my body when I die Brother Grant is well off & He has lived more in advancement & far riper for Eternity in 40 years than many would in a Hundred when I die I ownly want you to let my body rest in the grave I want to be buried decently but I do not wish any great Display at my funeral let your flags lie still & all your military display. I hope the body of Brother Grant may lie here undisturbed thill till the resurrection I see the warm feelings of the people for Brother Grant. it is cold let the people go home & let the bearers stay & see the grave filled up properly. The procession then returned to the House during the evening I called upon Brother Grants family I then attended meeting in the 14th ward. I was some unwell. I spoke a short time 
 December 5, 1856 ~ Friday5th I spent most of the day at home I was unwellDecember 6, 1856 ~ Saturday6th I spent the fore part of the day in the office I attended meeting of the Bishop & council & priesthood of the 14th ward at 2 oclock F. D. Richardswas present. I sat & herd the report of the Bretheren & when I [FIGURE] was requested to speak by Bishop Hoagland I arose & said that as Bishop Hoagland & the missionaries had appointed Men as teachers to the gentile stores to preach the gospel to them But the spirit said to me it was not wisdom to send men to preach the gospel to them I considered they were wicked & corrupt & it was like casting pearls before swine when I closed F. D. Richards Backed me & up & bore testimony that I said was true. Then Bishop Hoagland arose & opposed me vary strongly & said He presided over the 14 ward & had sent the Teachers to preach to the Gentiles & he wished them to go & do it I at once saw the gentiles were devil had ensnared him when He sat down the Teacher arose & said what shall I do Brother Woodruff says do not go to those Gentiles Bishop Hoagland says go. I arose & said to the teachers obey your Bishop for Hesays he will take the responsibility upon himself in sending teachers to them many of the Priesthood were fired up upon the subject but the meeting closed & we went home At about 5 oclok the Calafornia mail came in & Brother Richards & myself went up to Presidents Youngs we related to him what had taken place withus & Bishop Hoagland President Young was asstonished at the position which Brother Hoagland had taken He said the devil was leading him into dificulty which he could not extricate himself without Help. He immediately sent for Bishop Hoagland who came up & the subject was all talked over & President Young showed him his Error & he saw it President Young told him that the Twelveheld the keys of the Kingdom of God in all the world where the presidency are not, & that No Bishop presided over any one of the Twelve in any place the Bishop Made his confession and went home we santt a while & read Letters & papersseveral were received from Elder HydeDecember 7, 1856 ~ Sunday7th Sunday I attended meeting in the Tabernacle Edward Martin& Daniel Tyler Preached in the forenoon & C. G. Webb & Wm Clough Preached in the afternoon I Attended the prayer Circle. Heard the Letters read from Elders Hyde & others Elder Orson Hyde calls for 100 more men thinks there will be a prospect of a fight with the Calafornians. President Young said He wished all the men were at home & that Elder Hyde was at home in his store & that He would not take any Mission while he lived for He had lost the spirit of his office & was of no account. It made the President feel sorrowful to see the Twelve & others not feel the spirit of their office. At the close of the meeting I went home & with my family went to the 14 ward meeting in the Music Hall I was much pressed in spirit. After listening to the speeches of Brothers Hunt, Candland, & Pack I was requested to speak I arose upon my Feet though heavily pressed in spirit yet the spirit of God was inmy tabernacle like fire shut up in my bones and I spoke to the people [FIGURE] about 3/4 of an hour and I scearsly knew whether I was in the body or out of [it] neither can I remember but little what I said, the following is are some of the remarks which I made while the House was as still as the House of Death while the spirit of God filled the House. 
 Brethren & sisters I arise to say a few words to you But I am pressed in spirit & I can say as I have heard Brother Joseph say while smiteing upon his breast I would to God I could unbosom my feelings in the house of my friends, but I do not expect to do it but in a small degree for my mind is open in vision of things which I cannot utter or speak unto you for it is not lawful or expedient if I had the ability to do so. I am pained in spirit as I see the Bishop & council & teachers & missionaries labouring, toiling, rebuking & pounding the people trying to removeing the darkness & fog which hangs over this City & the 14th ward. But let me say to the Bishop & teachers & missionaries before me to night to go to work & search deeply your own hearts & get the spirit of the living God upon you remove the fog & darkness from your own minds & then you can see clearly to remove the darkness from the minds of the people. The priesthood need the spirit of God in order to know how to deal with the people & save them for when you knock the people in the Head in orderto wake them, when they get awake you should not still pound them untill you kill them. but get a Fatherly feeling & try to save them. Some of the teachers when they go through the ward to teach the people they get the big head & do not know ^how^ to treat the people. it is not nessary to stand here & jump & shout & stomp off 50 cts worth of sole leather in order to get the people to wake up or reform but it is a straight forward business matter to reform whare any one has stolen or done wrong in any thing let them return what they have taken & make restitution. It is a momentious time in Israel &it is necessary for this refermation in order to have the people prepared for the great things of God which are comeing upon the Earth & upon this people the line will be drawn & scenes will take place which will try mens souls & I warn all men & women before me this night that they do not make light of the things of the Kingdom of God or of this refermation for destruction is nigh the doors of such as do it & I warn our young Brethren & Sisters that they humble themselves before God & give heed to the words of Eternal Life listen to the council of the Bishop & Missionaries & teachers among you for if you despise the council of God & his servants judgment will come upon you & destress & anguish will be upon you. The Lord is calling loudly upon this people to repent & do the works of righteousness & Live your religin remember the Testimony of Brother Grant the testator is dead but the testiment is in force his hard labours to awaken this people have cost him his life He has laid down his body in the grave I made many other remarks while the fire & power of the Holy Ghost was burning within me. At the close of the meeting I called the Bishop & priesthood to gether & gave them instruction concerning the wrong cours Bishop Hoagland had taken with me I taught them the order of the Priesthood Bishop Hoagland was humble & made all necessary satisfactionDecember 8, 1856 ~ Monday8th I spent most of the day in the office at night I attended the meeting of the Missionaries & Bishops. Presidents Young & Kimball were present also W. Woodruff & F D Richards of the Twelve W Woodruff arose & called the Names of the Bishops & Missionaries most of which answered to their names. F. D. Richards opened By Prayer & singingW. Woodruff arose & said I feel as though I want to say a few wordit has seemed good unto the Lord to call a portion of us through the mouth of his servants to go forth unto the inhabitants of this City to preach the gospel of salvation & repentance unto the people, we have met each week to give a report of our procedings buthave not here to fore been associated with the Bishops in our meeting I stand connected with you as a missionary & realize that those who have assembled here this evening should stand as the candle & light of the Lord. I have never felt more responsibility resting 
 upon me than at present God has an object in sending us to preach the gospel of Repentance to the people & so had the servants of the Lord who sent us forth. I feel that it is necessary to purify ourselves & get the spirit of God before we can properly go forth to preach to the people if we will get the darkness & fog from ourselves we can take it From the people & the Elements will be Clear. I feel to purify myself I have felt the spirit of God resting upon me of Late & I feel that there is great things awaiting us. The Presidency of this church has had the Head Heart & soul ake for a long time it has caused their hearts to ake to see the Apostles & Elders of this church who bear the priesthood forget their calling & turn from the work of God unto Folly & have their hearts set upon the things of the worldwe may use the sledge hammer to much but we should be right ourselves when we reprove others. The Bishops & Missionaries in some instances have manifested a feelings for the mastery to know who should be the greatest but they would not have this feeling if they had the spirit of God. The Business of the Missionaries is to call upon the people to repent & live their religion & the Bishopsshould unite with them in the spirit of God to carry out this Great work. How Long shall we see the Presidency of this Church weighed down to the Earth with a Burthen which the Elders & people should bear. Aris up ye Bishops & missionaries & put on the whole armor of God & the people will live their religion when you live it yours yourselves then the burthen will begin to lighten upon the presidency some time when we sharply rebuke the people we are not right ourselvesthies things are true. It is time we arose in the spirit & power of our calling & help bear the burthen that is resting upon the shoulders of Presidents Young & Kimball. No man could live with the Load resting upon him that is now upon the head of those men unless he was nerved up & sustained Daily by the hand & power of God. I feel brethren that there is sumthing important awaiting us. The more I humble myself before God & get the Holy Ghost the more my heart is drawn out towards the presidency of this Church I have never seen the day in my life when I have felt to prize the society & council of those men as I do at the present time, this people have not prized them & their teaching as they ought & if they do not more appreciate their labour & keep their council better than they have done they will be taken from us. Brethren lay aside all your selfish feelings & you will see that God will be with us let us wake up ourselves & then the people not for this winter ownly but let the refermation last during our lives. Presidents Young & Kimball are present & I would like to hear them teach & council us this evening but I presume they feel as though they had taught us so long & so much which we have not improved upon that they feel discouraged inteaching us, & think we ought to know how to walk aright But I do not wish to occupy your time the spirit says I should close May God Bless you Amen President Young sung "O Happy souls who pray" then said Brother Woodruff has given us a good testimony a Living testimony in the spirit & power of the Holy Ghost. Now any of the rest of you who have the Holy Ghost arise & speak to us those things which will Edify. B. L. Clapp & E. D. Woolley then spoke a Few moments then President Young arose & spoke to the people the following is a synopsis of his remarks as I reported them all Brother Kimball 
 President Young arose & said. I dont expet to speak much to night I have learned to governed myself in talking as well as in other things it may be asked if this is a new work it is not a new work but our refermation is the work we begun in when we embraced the gospel. I have pointed out the Errors of the people all the time & shown the people ther faults & told them what to do but here is the difficulty as soon as the Elders come home from their missions in a few days they lay down their Armour while they should keep oit on all the time & keep it bright but their minds are engrossed with the things of the world & lie down & go to sleep their ownly ambition is to know how they can get this House built or a farm, Horses cattle &c, their whole soul is in the work of the world not the building of the Kingdom of God but any man that gets property upon this principle it will carode him he has not wisdom to use it. I have told the people a hundred times they do not know how to get rich. The way for the people to get rich is to do the will of God & they must be governed by the Revelations & spirit of God. Brother Woodruff has told us here to night how it is when I look upon the conduct of the people before the refermations commenced as I was teaching them the way of salvation daily & they would not give heed to it pained my heart & I felt as if I should die but when Brother Jedediah M Grant steped forward & took the Burthen off from me I was relieved But it has cost him his life Had he not have taken that burthen upon him he would have lived a few Years longer in our midst. I have felt that unless this people would awake & live their religion I must go down to the grave But the burthen of this people was taken from me & rested upon him & it has not yet returned to me although he is dead should it return to me as it has been I shall soon follow him to the grave for I could not live long with that wait upon me. When you first recieved the gospel did ^was^ not your heart filled with love & you put onthe gospels armour & would it not have continued with you all the timeif you had lived your religion all the time but you have had bad feelings in your Breast & against your Neighbour but if the spirit of God had continued with you it would have overcome those evil feelings and what if we were all to put our armour off & partook of the spirit of anger & Hatred God would spue us out of his mouth & we would go down to hell together & He would raise up another people to do his will. After all the stuper that has rested upon this people they have been gaping for more revelation I do not mean one man but I mean the whole people while they have already a great deal more than they are worthy off & if this people do not wake up & live their religion The Lord will take away the sources of revelation which they now have from the people, it is not a few men that have got to live their religion but it is this whole community. If we as a people will return unto the Lord I know he will receive us with open arms. I am glad that this winter has commenced without Fidling & danceing. But would their be any harm in going into the Hall & haveing a dance if we felt right & kept the spirit of God with us, No there would not. But as soon as we should open this door how many would keep the armour on & live their religion & keep the spirit of God not many, some would but many would say come let us go & take a drink & begin to get the liquor in them & then they would say come Brother Brigham I am ready for any thing stand out of the way here Hurrah for Hell sware a little Dam a little steal a little gamble a little, & raise the Devil. But we will stop Fidling & danceing untill the Brethren get power to overcome these things & keep them under their feet. I do not intend to start danceing again untill the 
 people will learn to do right, & live their religion. I have to war with the weakness of man I am incompassed with it, I know what it is to fight it all thetime. If you are going to continue a refermation make up your mind to live your religion. If the people will do this it will be as Brother Woodruff says the darkness will pass away & I can live long among this people & so can brother Kimball & other men But if this people will go on lieing stealing swearing & whoreing I do not want to live but I want to leave the people & go to God & let the wicked go to Hell I hope that God willsend the wicked that will not repent ^go^ down to hell quickly & be burned up that they may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. When I first came into this church I was an Enthusiast & thought I would never keep an account never put pen to paper nor never say this or that was mine but it is the Lords we never can be of one heart & one mind untill we can say that all we have is the Lords & that we are ^ownly^ his servants & stewards to controll it accord[ing]to his will. When the Lord gives me property He gives me wisdom to use it.We have individual rights & shall have to all Eternity. what are those rights If I have any property Horses Cattle waggons or any thing Els my neighbor has no right to stell it from me. and if the people have the spirit of the Lord they would know that it was not right to take any thing which belonged to another without liberty but let it remain whare it is. we are accounting for our time to the Lord now if you have a months leasure time & you gamblethat away & do not bring to pass any good you might just as well throw away $20 and you are accountable for this waste of time. I am often asstonished at the folly of this people many women are asking their husbands for some new thing they want a dozen new Dresses & many unnecessary things but does a person want of Doz new Dresses if this people would ask for those things which are necessary & do right you would soon see the people get rich. but what are you doing? are you rich No. the Lord can send the grasshoppers Crickets & Locust they are his Armies & can Eat us up and kill our Cattle He can give us much or little as He pleases If our eyes are single to the glory of God & we do our duty the Lord could make us as rich as Cesar what would do with it aggrandize yourselves, no you should not, but send out millions of men to gather the poor & send men with mules loaded with gold to buy the Nations but now we are poor & we can comparitively do but little. Now I am here with Brother Kimball If you wish to ask any question we can answer right but for me to teach the Bishops there duty it is folly for I have taught them over & over for years. Now if I was going to a ward meeting to preach and the bishop was to oppose me unless it was my duty to reprove him I should sit & laugh at him but not contend with him. But when their is any difficulty between a missionary & Bishop or any two men they should not contend about it before the people but talk it over among themselves & settle all diference of opinion in the spirit of God & not labour for the masteryPresident H. C. Kimball followed & said I am one with President Young & so was J. M. Grant He to[o]k hold of the work to wake up the people with all his might & it killed him. If President Young was to ask me to go forth in the safme way I would do it but it would cut short my life as it did his. I have never felt as though Jedediah was dead the saviour said those that abide in me will never die his spirit is with us & he can do more for us now than he could before. The spirit of Godis poured out upon some men mightily. The refermation is doing good & the people are doing better & those who get the spirit of God will stand & those who do not will fall. The people are forsaking their sins

He said if I was the president or speaker of the Legislator I would not refer the message to any committee or say [FIGURE] one word about it. I hope there will be nothing said about it in the Legislatorat all. They want us to pay taxes & next they will want us to send a thousand men to the war. What will they do about the taxes the people have not the money they would have to take wheat & Lumber & such things as the people have if they get any thing but they will not collect the taxes Here neither will they get 1000 men to go into the Armey they would spend one million of Dollars by sending an armey here to collectthirty thousand dollars taxes they have sought our Destruction all the day long why do they not pay othere own debts they destroyed there army 
 1861and amuniction at Camp Floyd so that we should not get any ofit when the government is owing Utah there Quota of arms I willse them in Hell before I will raise an army for them. Abe Lincolnhas sent these men her to prepare the way for an Army An orderhas ben sent to Calafornia to raise an army to come to Utah this is the reason why Bell came back. I pray daily that the Lord will take away the reigns of Government of the wicked rulers & put it into the Handsof wife [wise] good [men]. I will see the day when those wicked rulers wiped out theGovernor quoted my sayings about the Constitution I do and alwayshave supported the Constitution but I am not in league with suchcursed scoundrels as Abe Lincoln and his Minions they have sought our destruction from the Begining & Abe Lincoln has orderedan army to this Territory from Calafornia & that order passedover on these wires. A, senator from Calafornia said in Washingtona short time since that the Mormons was in there way & must beremoved. The feelings of Abe Lincoln is that Buchannan triedto destroyed the mormons & could not, now I will try my hand at it.

Orson Hyde Preached upon the subject of the Revelations of St John spoke of the Book sealed with seven seals, theopening of the seals, the Blowing of the trumps, and pouring out of the plaguesupon the wicked. He was followed By President Young who said theBook that John sayw in the Hands of the angel was the Book containing the record of the Events of the children of men upon this Earththe scribes keep a record in Heaven of the acts of men as they trans-pire upon the Earth & they will be Judged out of the Books. The Beaststhere spoken of By John were actual Beasts that were raised fromthe dead A true Prophet speaks of things which are true they do notprophesy falsly. "we shall see the Judgments of God poured outupon the wicked untill it will make us weep He said many interesting 
 1861things and the spirit & power of God was upon him. ErastusLorenzo Snowspoke in the afternoon also Elder Hyde. The Twelve met at theHistorians office for Prayer President Young met with usF. D. Richards Prayed Lorenzo Snow was mouth at the close President[FIGURE] Young said he had received over Eleven thousand dollars in goldfor the telegraph polls which he had set up, or delivered on the linesHe said I did not tuch that gold with my fingers or flesh untill it was all paid in. I then put it in a vessel of water & clensed it and said what words I wished over it I then delivered evry dime of it over for tithing I have not used one farthing of it for my own use. this is what I have done knowone knows any thing about it Exceptmy clerks and I dont want you to say any thing about it.It has been said that we have sold tithing wheat to the armey we have done no such thing. Ferrymore Little made a contract to let them have some wheat. We loaned him some wheat, to Fill that contract whichhe has paid. Again Mr Bell made us a proposal that if we woulddeliver our southern wheat at Camp Floyed He would deliver asmuch at the Tithing office so Brother Sharp left his loads of wheatthere & Bell left the same amount at the tithing office for us you can tell the people this & let them understand how it is. We then wentbelow into the Historians office when G. A. Smith presented to thePresident an Act to provide for calling a convention. PresidentYoung said that is right and let the convention ask the General Government to admid us as a state and if they dont do it tell them that we will organize a state government and controllif we do not do sumthing to head this military operationthey will afflict us the whole country will soon be a mil-itary despotism. we must soon take care of ourselves we mustsoon organize a government for ourselves and take care of ourselves.

He tought us the importance of our doing right & living the Law of Life that we might be strong & healthy & have healthychildren and that Mothers should be prudent for the Benefit of there osprings. George Symns spoke in the afternoonPresident Young & Wells called in the evening & several ofthe Twelve & spent a short time we then spent the Evening at President Youngs officeDecember 23 1861 ~ Monday23rd I spent the afternoon in the Legislature in the Evening thecommittees on Revenue met at the Historians Office also President Young & Wells we had a corcus [caucus] to take into consideration thesubject of the welfare of the inhabitats of Utah. We readthe long Law upon the direct tax and discussed that subjectPresident Young said in speaking of Govornor Dawson you take a man like him who has been an Editor for 15 years and you will find him to be a Jackass. He told the story of BrockassOn the steamer going down the river. The Homestead Billwas spoken of. President Young said the Lord will soon passa Homestead Bill. you need not look for the Nation to do muchfor us. H Stout was of the opinion that the Legislature had not the power to make laws disposing of Lands & improvementsE. T. Benson, & Orson Hyde made short speeches. President Youngfollowed & said you want to go to & call a convention we wantto get up a state government. I believe as I live that thatwe should organize a State Government and let it go intoEffect by the 15th March & I have faith to believe that God willsustain us. This is a secret corcus & I dont want it knownwhat is done here. I can say this about forming a State Gover-nment I Believe that Abel Lincoln does intend to bring destruction 
 Dec 23rd 1861Upon this people if he can and has the power. I want to sayone word with regard to assuming this diret tax I think we hadbetter let the Government appoint there own officers & collectthere own tax, for I am satisfied that a Legal & Lawful assesor & collecter cannot be found in this Territory according to this lawfor there is not a Free holder in this TerritoryDecember 24, 1861 ~ Tuesday24 I spent a part of the day in the Legislature the Afternoon I met[FIGURE] in the New Hall in the 14 ward at 10 oclok for the purpose of dedica-ting the House. Mrs Woodruff with several others of the sistershave been at work night and day almost for several days in makingthe curtains & trimings for the windows and doors in order to getit ready for the Dedication. Brother Edington took the supervis-ion of the whole triming of the House. President Young arivedat about 11 oclok He called upon me to offer the Dedication PrayerThe following Dedication Prayer was offered by W WoodruffO God our Eternal Father we present ourselves before thee thisMorning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to Dedicate this Houseunto Thee, and we ask for thy Holy Spirit to bring all things toour rememberance which may be nessacessary in the dedicationof this House. We dedicate the Foundation of this building together with the ground upon which it stands that it may be Holy from the commencement to the name of Most High. We dedicate theFoundation with the rock Mortar and timbers and all thingsappertaining thereto that it may be Holy unto the Lord. We dedicatethe walls of this House with the adobies, the mortar and everytihing appertaining thereto that it may be Holy unto Thee. Wededicate the door with the Joists boards and nails thereof thatthe same may be Holy unto Thee. We also dedicate the windowswith the sash, glass putty and every thing pertaining thereto also the curtains with the trimings ^thereof^ and the shades thatthey may be Holy unto thee Lord. we dedicate the doors withthe Hinges screws locks, latches, and every thing pertainingthereto that they may be Holy unto Thee the Lord our God. Wededicate the Roof with the rafters, boards, shingles, lath, nails 
 Dec 24 1861Plastering, cornice, ornamental work and all things appertaining thereto that Evry thing may be Holy and consec-rated unto Thee. We dedicate the stand the pulpit the seats thefloor the Boards the paint and evry thing belonging theretoalso the Benches and seats in this room that they may be Holyunto the Lord. And we pray that this dedication, may be acceptable, that this house and the ground whare on it standsmay be Holy unto Thee, and we ask that thy Blessings may rest upon the Bishops and Priests and Elders who may occupy this stand that they may be inspired to speak unto the Edifycationof this people and that they may magnify the Holy Priesthoodgiven unto them. And we pray that this House may be cleanand every thing clean and pure which dwells thereinO God the Eternal Father we dedicate this House unto theeand thy Kingdom for the purpose of Preaching, teaching, instruction, singing & prayer, and for the teaching of Our Children, and for Lawful and innocent recreation. we praythat thy protecting care may be over this House, that it may be protected from fire and winds, and Every Evil ElementAnd O God we pray that the spirit and power of darknessmay have no dominion here, That thy saints may inherit this place in peace, that no Enemy may have power in this House. And should the day Ever come that the Enemiesof thy Saints should have dominion in this Land grant thatthis Building may be destroyed from the foundation and notone stone left upon another that the wicked and unholy may never inherit this House, nor this City nor any of the Housesof thy Saints which have been dedicated unto thee Grant to acceptof this dedication we beseech of Thee that thy spirit may rule and reign in this House, and may thy saints not worshipthis House nor any thing appertaining to this Earth, But maythey worship the Lord of Hosts and help do thy will andEsstablish thy kingdom upon the Earth. And if anything therebe pertaining to this Building or the ground upon which it stands thatwe have not named before thee Grant that it may be Holy, that all thingspertaining thereto with the dedication thereof may be acceptable unto Thee which we ask in the name of Jesus Christ our Redeemer Amen 
 Dec 24 1861At the close of the Dedication Prayer President Young addressed the saints the following are some of the remarks which he made[FIGURE] He said as I have the privilege of speaking I hope I many be actuated by the spirit of intelligence. As Brother Woodruffhas asked the Lord in his prayer so I feel to say amen to the whole of it even to the destruction of the Buildings if our Enemiesever had power to possess it. But I do mot think ewe shall ever be driven from this inheritance I am satisfied we nevershall be if we live our religion & do our duty. Here we aregathered together from all the Nations of the Earth, like the net cast into the sea it gathers both good & bad and each one works out what is in him. While Brother Woodruff was offering the dedication Prayer I was wondering if they dedicated there School Houses anciently. They dedicated Solomons Temple but I dont know as they did there School Houses But we shoulddedicate ourselves and all we have unto the Lord. We still have some among us who still wish to mingle with the wicked they stillwant to introdue Mr Devil to me & to this people and such wood hender the progress of the kingdom of God. I am pleased to meetwith you here to day. I see the taste which you have displayed inthe finishing of this house which I like and admire. Pardonme for quoting a remark of a man from the north in seedingthe 13 ward Assembly rooms proped up to keep them fromfalling down. He said the glory of the Bishop of the 13 ward had departed. But I hope the glory of the Bishop of the 14 ward will not depart as did the 13 ward I hope this House will not fall down. I am pleased to see that you havebrought together the Elements which surround you and Erected a Beautiful Hall which is a pleasure to meet in. Even the most wicked take pleasure in beholding that which is beautiful & lovely. I delight to meet here my soul is full of Blessings for this people. we are living in a world of sin yet we areapproaching to the light and travelling together as Latter Day Saints we should dedicate our all to God. The gospel of Jesus Christ is to make good men better and to put them in a position to receive Happiness Joy and glory to the fullness 
 Dec 24th 1861of the capacity of man. Many Elders pray that they may may have confidence in God. But I pray that I may live sothat God may have confidence in me I think it folly to praythat I may have confidence in God for He is right all the time and if we will live so that he may have confidence in us we will do well. It is our duty to make all the improvement we can while we live. All that we see here on the Earth is a similitude of what is in heaven. wehave the Elements all around us to beautify & adorn zion but we should not set our hearts upon Go[l]d or silver or any thing upon Earth But sanctify the Lord in our Hearts then we shall partake of Eternal life. I say to the 14 ward if you occupy this House in the fear of God it will prove a Blessing to you. In the time of the persecution in Missouri we had to walk up & sign a Deed of trust to pay theExpenses of the mob in driving out the saints they said Jo Smith could not make the saints consecrate but we can make them consecrate. The saints here complained ofpaying a little tax and a little tithing money I dont know but the Lord will let us pay a little money tax to the Devil the Government requires a direct tax of some $27,000 dollars When you have parties in this House dont admit drunken men into it. another principle I wish to speak of if the Bishop wishes to invite a Gentile in dont let the people complainabout it for when a Gentile comes in here and the priesthood rules the Gentiles can do no hurt, But Let an Elder orany latter Day Saints go & attend a party among the Gentiles whare they reign and it is vary different that would be rong. we should never bow down to the wicked we should never descend but asscend & try to Elevate others to our standard Men come here from the States & profess to be asstonished at our History and improvements, and they come here Expectingto accomplish that which they will not do. Most of the officers which the Government have sent here are a Hiss and a By word and a stink in the nostralls of all good men and therenever was a wickeder man than the President of the United States 
 Dec 24 1861and so are his associates vary wicked men. I hop we will strive to magnify our lives which God has given us, for weshall either go on to life Everlasting, or descend to Everlasting destruction. if we were all pure in heart as we should be we would have pureower to hold our children & not bury them as we now do. Now go to & dedicate your hearts & your houses and all you have unto God. I feel to bless you in the name of the Lord. we are in a world of sin, darkness & temptation, and any man who will not be faithful to thislife how can He Expect to obtain Eternal Life. We have gotthe kingdom of God Esstablish on the Earth and what we cannot Buind to the kingdom of God we will let go. President Young was followed by D. H. Wells & O Hyde theyboth made many good remarks.I spent the Afternoon in the Legislature and in the evening I attended a party at the 14 ward School House the first Held in the HallDecember 25, 1861 ~ Wednesday25 [FIGURE] I spent the most of the Afternoon in the Legislature I attended a Legislative Ball in the Social Hall about 20 Gentiles were present we had supper & Paid $5 per coupleDecember 26, 1861 ~ Thursday26 I spent the after noon in the Legislature we adjourned untillthe 3rd of Jan 1862December 27, 1861 ~ Friday27 I spent this day in the Endowment House we gave Endowmentsto some 60 persons All the Presidency were present Brother Wells sealed about 30 couple and I sealed 9 coupleDecember 28, 1861 ~ Saturday28 I spent most of the day writing in the Journal in the officeDecember 29, 1861 ~ Sunday29 Sunday I met with my Quorum in the Morning attended Meeting at the Tabernacle all day Bishop Collester & G.

Richards & Bishop HoaglandDecember 30, 1861 ~ Monday30 I spent the day in the office writing in my Journal I attended a Jordon Dam Meeting at the 17 ward school HouseDecember 31, 1861 ~ Tuesday31st I spent the day in the office looking over my Journal 
 Dec 31, 1861This is the last day of 1861 which has past and gone and borne its report to heaven of the deeds of all Nations and men. This year has brought to pass much of the fulfillment of the predictions of the Ancient and ModernProphets of God. See this Journal DecJan 31st 1861 I there declaired as a Prophetic Historian that this year would be the most distressing year America Ever sayw since theywere an independant Nation time has proven it soFive States viz Missisippi, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana & Floridaseceded from from the Union in January the first monthof the year Texas seceded in Febuary. then followed NorthCarolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Virginia, and A part ofMissouri have all seceded during 1861. This has broughton a terrible war upon the Nation both North & South haverushed to armes Untill the North alone has over six hundredthousand men under arms and the South near the samenumber of men. this war has cost the Northern States someFive Hundred Millions of Dollars during the past year and manythousands of lives and this is ownly the Begining of troublethe close of 1862 will leave America with a debt uponher shoulders of One Billion dollars a debt as large as thedebt of England. The state of Missouri whare the saintshave received there persecutions is now the great Battlefieldof the west. it is now man against man & neighbor against Neighborthey who have spoiled the saints are now being spoiledIndependance, & Jackson County Missouri, is nearly destroyedis is the case with many parts of the State. The Lord hastaken peace from the Earth and all Nations are still prepar-ing for war. The Lord has pointed out the fate of this Nationin the Book of Mormon and Doctrins & CovenantsHe has said that when they became ripened in iniquitythey should be cut off, that day has come there cupof iniquity is full, the whole Nation Rulers and peopleare filled with corruption befor God And the presi-dent & Senate of the United States are sending mento Utah to rule over this people as a Govornor & Judges 
 1861who are so corrupt that they are a Hiss & bye word and a stink in the Norstrills of all people in the streets. John W. Dawson was sent By President Lincoln to Utah as there Governor He arived in Great Salt Lake City on the7 of Dec. Delivered his miessage on the 10th to the Utah Legislature and immediately commenced a scene of debauchery and insulted women untill the widow ofThomas Williams drove him out of her house with a fireshovel because ^of^ his vulgar abuse to her, and He has left this city for the East this day in the mail stage a disgraced debauched Libertine, he left because He could not hold Up his head in the streets and look the people in the facebecause ohif his crimes. These are the kingd of Rulers theGentiles send to rule over Israel and Israel Begins toFeel that it is time to rise up and appoint her own Governors, Judges & Rulers & trust in God for the EResult The American Nation as a United States Government is doomed To destruction and No power can save it. They have forfeitedall right and title to Redemption or salvation at the Hand ofthe Lord or his Saints it is decreed that the measure which theyhave meeted out unto the saints shall be meetied unto them and they are hastening unto there work of desolation, war, Bloodshed, & destruction and wo, wo, is ther doom. The spirit of Prophecywould cry O, Lord, Hasten thy work, let the wicked slay the wickeduntill the whole land is clensed from the corruption, sin, abominations, and wickedness which now reigns upon the faceof the whole Earth. May thy Judgments continue to be pouredout upon this land of North America untill the Blood of Prophets & Saints is avenged before the Lord and thy words fulfilled upon the Land of Joseph. Take away the sceptre rule andGovernment from the wicked & corrupt and give it into the Hands of the Just even thy saints, that they may rule inrighteousness before thee. Give thy oppressed people O Lordthe privilege of appointing there own Governor, Judges, andRulers, from this time forth that thy Kingdom may be Esstab-lished upon the Earth, and the poor rejoice in the Holy One of Israel

 Aug 27 19861Than to ask one of my Family to drink whiskey with him one in six month the thief is the best man of the two for the whiskey maker will be of no use when he gets in Hell ownly to tocarry swill to the Hogs. I would not kill a man who would make & sell whiskey & destroy the souls of men for dimes for I would considermyself disgraced for I would want to kill a more descent man if I killed any body, and any body who will make & sell whiskeyto this people for money ought to be damned and He will be && I will tell you Brother Badley that you will welter in Hell for what you have done and so will all others who have made & sold whiskey for the dimes Publicans & Harlotts will Enter into the kingdom of God before you, and I mean all I say.

I should have waited an hour after the time before I should have opened the Conference but Brother Hydeopened it before the time & he has served me the same several times and I dont want to see it any more. Elder Orson Hiydesaid it never Entered my heart that I was doing wrong severalwho were president [present] said it was 10 oclok & asked me to open the Conference & I ownly done it to open the way for you.

Brother Hyde said He would remember it for the future, I do not think anyone of the Twelve thought of it. President Young said Now I will 
 April 7, 1861ask all of you, how would you feel if you had a work to do whichGod & the heavens held you responsible for & just as you was about tostep forth to do it another man should rise up & take it out of your handsBefore the people as though you was not qualifyed to Do it or& was neg-lecting your duty you would not like it you would feel schagrined and so did I.

The South are better prepaired & much faster than the North are. Lincoln has taken a course to rather keep the North back. But the curse of God will be upon the Nation and they will have Enough of it. The Rulers possess no Power in the Land, they have persecuted the Saints of God and the Rulers would do nothing for us but all they could against us and they will now get their pay for it. In speaking of Governor Cummings President Young Said He had done us good He had stood between us & the army But the Lord had made him do it. But He was united with the armey untill Col Kane visited him when he first came here He was not going to the army but I told him to go & to follow the same spirit that broughthim out here He done so he went to the armey, & brought in Gov. Cummings. The Govornor & Col Johnson was at swords points fromthat time. The question was asked what we would do if the President sent Secretary Harris hiere as Govornor would we 
 April 278 1861not also cecede. President Youndg said No, we will keep our records clean we shall want to compare records by & by & we want to show on our part that we are right all thetime. If the boys were all right they ought to piss such a manas Harris out of the country or whittle him out yet if we submsubmit to such mean things put upon us by the government we shallget our reward and they will get therirs it is better for us to submit to those things which are unplesant than for us to do wrong & for all the oppressions they put upon us God will bring them intoJudgment. In speaking of the war it is said that the South threaten to burn the Northern Cities the North can play at that Game also the ownly difficulty that I can see is there are so many traiters in the NorthApril 29, 1861 ~ Monday29 It is warmer to day it has been vary cold for more than a week.

 Dec 31st 1860This is the last day of 1860 which Ends this important & momentiousyear, which has been looked forward to by thousands for many yearsas a period which would date the commencement of great & mightychanges in the Earth, changes which would greatly Effect the interest& welfare of all Nations under Heaven. Now what are the facts in thecase as far as they have come to the knowledge of the Historiamn. T[h]ay arethese. The whole European world have appeared inspired to spendmillions & labor with all their might to build Navies & Equipt armies& prepare For a mighty struggle & deadly conflict with Each othersAll Italy has risen up in the magesty of her streng[th]s under her greatleader Garabaldi and flung off ^the^ galling Napolitan yoke and formed an Elective Monarchy Receiving Victor Emanuel as their kingEngland & France has made both war & peace with the ChineeseEmpire while they have both been preparing there armies & Navies fora Bloody struggle at home. But the United States of America is the spot whare 1860 markes the commencement of a new Erea inthe History of that Government & people, it is [in] the midst of this Governmentwhare the God of Heaven has set up his kingdom in the Latter DaysHe sent An angel to this people thirty years ago raised up a prophet called & ordained him to preach the gospel of Christ & Esstablish his Church & kingdom in the midst of the people. Joseph the prophet of God was Faithful to his calling, esstablished the Church of Christ, was filledwith revelation & prophesy declaired the word of God unto the peopletold them what would come to pass in there midst the wars and Judgments of God that awaited them because of there wickednessand as Jesus told the Jews the Fate & calamities that awaited theJewish Nation so Joseph Smith the Prophet of God told the people ofthe United States Government what awaited them & there finalDestiny as a Nation because of there wickedness & abominations & becausethey would shed the Blood of Prophets & Saints. He said in 1832, 28 yearsago that South Carolinia would rise up in rebelion and that warwould commence at that place & that the Southern States would ariseup in rebelion against the Northern States & the Northern States againstthe Southern States & that war would be poured out upon allNations which would End in the death & miser of many of many souls & because of these things or as the prophet has said the people of the 
 1860United States have put to death the prophet Joseph the Patriarchs Apostle & many Saints and driven the Church of Christ from place to place for about thirty years and, Finally have driventhem into the wilderness even into the these vallies of the Mountainand the Lord told us "to plead at the feet of the Judges Governors& Presidents of the United States & if they Heed us not and do not redress us of our wrongs (then the Lord says) I will arise out of my hiding place & in my fury I will vex the Nation and I will cut off those wicked & unjust stewards and appoint them there portiuns with Hipocritts & unbelievers. 1860 has laid the foundation for the fulfillment of these things during this year theAbolitionest of Republicans of the Northern States Elected theirPresident and Vice President and this has been taken as a pretextand the Southern States are rising up in rebelion agast the NorthernStates are holding conventions & preparing to cecede from the Unionas Joseph Smith said they would. South Carolinia cecededfrom the Union on the 270 Dec 1860 and others are preparing tofollow their example this has caused a great convultion throughoutthe United States all Banking & monied institutions are suspendingspecia payment, and the wheels of Government are beginging to be clogedalarm & confusion is spreading throughout the whole land. TheLord is withdrawing his spirit from the Nation and they are beginingto be filled with madness towards Each other and the Southern States are arming & preparing for a Deadly conflict against theNorthern States and whome the Lord wants to destroy he first makesmad and the people are being inspired with madness to such a degreethat they are ready to devour each other, the foundation has beenlaid during the year 1860 To break up & annihilate the AmericanGovernment and the scenes which will follow in quick succession will be terrible & horrible in their detail. This Nation is guilty ofsheding the Blood of the Lords anointed, of his Prophets & Saintsand the Lord Almighty has decreed their destruction theLord has commenced a controversy with the American Governmentand Nation in 1860 and he will never cease untill they aredestroyed from under heaven, and the Kingdom of God esstablished upon their ruins. Let the Gentiles upon this land prepare to meet their God

 WILFORD WOODRUFF'SJOURNALFOR1861 
 January 1, 1861 ~ TuesdayJAN 1st 1861This is the commencement of another new Year and of a varyimportant year. Joseph Smith the Prophet said whoever lived tosee 1860 would live to see the foundation laid for some most awfulbloody wars and whoever lived to see those two figgures come together1866 would live to see a day when the Earth would be deluged in bloodin many places & wthere would be such awful distress & calamity thatit would be a vexation to hear the report of it. We may prepare ourselves for an awful time in the United States. The hand writing hasbeen seen upon the wall And our Nations is doomed to diestructionthe United States will be visited this year with much afflictionmore than they have ever seen since they have been a Free Govern[men]t and it will increase yearly untill they are destroyed. they are likethe Ox going to the slaughter they know not the day of their visitationThe Judgments of God await them because of their wickedness andwhile we are looking for the judgments of God to rest upon theUnited States & Great Babylon at large let us turn our Eyes towardsZion in these vallies of the Mountains and ask what state are the people in are they righteous & keeping the commandments of Godand preparing themselves for the great things of God which awaitthem or are they lying, stealing, swareing, & mingling with the drunken yes many of those who are calling themselves Saints are doing these things and they have great need to repentbefore the Lord. or they will Be damned & the Judgments of God will rest upon themSouth Carolinia seceded from the Union Dec 20, 1860Missisippi Convention voted to secede from the Union Jan 9, 1861 Yeas 84 Nays 15Georgia seceded Jan 10th 1861, yeas 208 Nays 89Florida seceded Jan 10th [1861,] signed 11th Yeas 62 Nays 7.Alabama seceded Jan 101 [1861,] Yeas 61 Nays 39Louisaniana seceded Jan 26 [1861,] Yeas 113 Nays 17Texas seceded Feb 1, 1861 Yeas 156 Nays 7

President Brigham Young & Heber C Kimball arived the Meeting was opened by singing & President Young said we will now have the Dedication Prayer offered By Wilford Woodruff the following is the prayer offered up in the dedication of the HouseO god the FaEternal Father we present ourselves before thee in the name of Jesus Christ for the purpose of dedicating this house unto the Lord our God we pray thee to grant unto us thy Holy Spirit that we may dedicate this House unto thee in a manner which may be acceptable unto thee Lord We dedicate the ground unto the Lord our God upon which the Foundation of this building stands that it may be Holy. We dedecate the foundation of this Hall, unto the Lord, the stone, the sand, clay, Lime & mortar and every thing appertaining thereto that it may be Holy. We dedicate the walls of this building the Adobies & mortar & evry thing appertaining thereto unto the Lord that it may be Holy. We dedicate the windows the curtains, & every thing conenected there with unto the Lord that they may be Holy. We dedic-ate the cealing the cornish, with its ornamenting and all belonging thereto that it may be Holy. We dedicate the roof with the shingles, nails, sheeting, rafters, & everything connected therewith unto the Lord that it may be Holy We dedicate the doors with the Hinges latches & locks and all belonging thereto unto the Lord that they may be Holy. We dedicate the floor with all belong the seats & all belonging there to that it may be Holy. We dedicate unto the Lord our God this pulpit & stand with the quishions & standseats & triming that it may be the most Holy place for the priests of the Lord to administer in Holy things. We dedicate the chandeliers with the Lamps that they may be Holy unto the Lord. We dedicate this Build-ing as a whole from the foundation stone to the top thereoff with every thing appertaining thereto that it may be Holy unto the Lordand we ask thee O God the Eternal Father wein askthe thee inname of Jesus Christ that thou will except of the Dedecation of this House at the Hands of thy people that it may be Holy, and will thou cloth all of thy servants who shall administer in this House with the spirit & power of God & the gift of the Holy Goshost that they may 
 1861Be Holy and may no unclean thing be permitted to dwellin this House. Whether the Priest of the Lord administer in Holy things in this House or whether thy sons & daughters goforth in the dance in this House, may the spirit of the Lord rest upon thy people that they commit no evil within the walls of this House. We ask thee O God the Eternal Father that thou wilt except of the dedication of this House at the Hands of thy People in the Name of Jesus Christ AmenAt the close of the dedication Prayer President Brigham Young arose and addressed the assembly He said as concerning thatis House "&cI know but vary little about it I do not know for whatpurpose it was built if it was built for meetings alone I am satisfied with it, but if it was built for school purposes it is not suitable I have not been consulted concerning the building of this Hall, I did not know that thery were building it untill the walls were Erected I wonce gave a pattern for building schools houses in this city for each ward but there has never been a school House built after that pattern in this Territy. My pattern was sumthing like the following Build two wings 20 By 30 feet for common schools then build a centre Building say 30 by 60 feet make a Basement for seting furnices or stoves for heating the whole building but not forschool rooms. On the first floor above the basement at the south End build a room for a Library then let there be a door from each wing into the Library. OnLet the north End of thesame room be appropriated for teaching the Higher Branches and Let all scholars be classaified according to their ages and qualifycations. Then let the 2nd story be formed into one roomfor a lecture room similar to this whare one class or all classes may assemble to hear lectures upon any subject what ever.I wish to give a word of council to the people I shall not giveany to the Bishop but I wish to say to the people dont you send your children to go to school in this basement story it is not Healthy asconcerning the Education of children I will say that not withstand-ing the drivings of this people I do not believe that you can go into any city in the world & pick up 100 children promiscusly 
 1861and put them by the side of our children that are as well educated as the same number of our children gathered up promiscusly in theTerritory of Utah. There are some people & countries who force & whip their children into an Education but we should never croud & force the minds of our children beyoung what they are ableto bear if we do we ruin them for life. I would rather my childrenwould spend their Early life sliding down Hill, skating, riding Horses till they were 20 years old & not go to school one day than to clog & force the mind while young with intricate studies it strains & cripplesthe mind for life & ruins the man, you never see a child that is confin-ed while young to close rooms & hard study & followed up to manhoodthat ever becomes a master spirit or qualifyed to transact difficult business in after life. I do not think there is a man upon the face of the whole Earth that has as great a complicated variety of subjects & things to attend to to weigh upon the mind as I have, at the sametime, I do not think there is a man upon Earth who can accomplish as much business in an hour, day, month, or year, with as much Ease and as little trouble as I do. But should I do as most people do it would soon ruin me. But I thoroughly train my mind so that I permit nothing to trouble me upon the Earth. I strive to do my duty in all things upon the Earth then leave the Event with the Lord when any subject or thing comes before me I train my mind in such away that I can bring the whole force & strength of my mind to bear upon it and I keep itthere untill I have done with the subject I comprehend every truththere is connected with the subject necessiary for the accomplish-ment of whatever business is before me, & as soon as the business isdone I train my mind to instantly forget it & cast it away & should never think of it again unless some circumstance should transpire necessary to call it up. I am now at the dedication of this Hall my mind is here when I get through & go away I may never think of this meeting again unless some person should call it to my mind. when I have been crouded with business through the day & I go to my bed to rest though I may not be any more sleepy than I am now, the moment I lie down I throw evry thing out of my minduntill it is like a peace of white blank paper I neither care for nothing nor know nothing & in one minute I am asleep my wife has spoken 
 Jan 1st 1861to me many times in one minute after I have lain down & awaikme up. mMany other interesting remarks were made By President Young which I have not written but it was reported by J. V. LongBrother Kimball Followed President Young and gave a vary good Exertation to the people which waf [was] reported By J. V. Long.

He says we ought not to preach what we do not practice I do not do it I have got two years provision laid up also clothing Brother Woodruff here lays up provision & clothing, there are but few that do it. Now how many will preach to the people & tell them to be like God while they do notattempt to imitate the Lord but if a wife do not please them they will pitch their wife or child out of doors and soon loose all the Lord has givenhim now If we done as the Lord does if our families did not do right & obey us we would bear with them, & feed them, & cloth them, and treat them kindly that they may be saved. Look & se how long the Lord bears with the [FIGURE] wicked He rains upon the Just & unjust & if we want to be like the Lord we should bear with the weaknesses of our wives & children. he said Hehad some wives who had never been subject to his council & will yet yet He took good care of them & treated them kindly {He had one woman that had committed adultery yet he fed her and took care of her but did not sleep with her as a wife} He said many [things] which were Edifying.

A pleasant morning I attended the funeral of Charles Little, the son of [FIGURE] Jesse C Little. President Young preached a short discourse on the occasionNo reporter the following is a synopsis of what he saidI reflected upon the subject of coming to this funeral I thought If I come Brother Little would wish me to speak and I thought I should wantmuch of the spirit of the Lord to assist me to overcome my weakness to which I am subject on occasions like this. At times I can overcome it. The question has often been asked how is it with little children will they grow or not after death Joseph once said they would, & then He said they would notHe never had any revelation upon the subject. And I have no doctrin 
 31 Jan 1861to give upon the subject. I Believe in the great variety in the vast creationsof God. I do not Believe that the Lord ever made two worlds alike or thingsalike in any world, I do not believe that the Human family have beenalike in stature in the various ages of this world. The Lord has power to give a soul or spirit as miuch intelligence in a tabernacle 2 or 3 feet highas in a gient 8 or 10 feet high as we find Evidences that in some ages of this world men have lived to that hight. My doctrin or belief is thatwe shall find all children & People at the resurrection as they lie downwith the same stature, that is the way I want to receive my childrenif I bury a child that is two years old, I dont want him or her to cometo me in a tabernacle 80 or 100 years old or at any other age ownly theage it left me and that is the way I believe it will be. We shall seethere spirits before we see there bodies. Whare shall we go to find themin the spirit world but whare is that right here on the Earth whare theylived & whare we live. I have desired to see the spirit of a Friend & to converswith it as I would with you, but I have never yet had this privilegeI want to know how they live in the spirit world what for a place theyhave as I would come & look at Brother Littles House. But I believe allspirits live here after Death and no whare Els, at least those who have taberna-cled in the flesh on the Earth, whether they be good or bad, Satan has no powerover those who have overcome him in the flesh after they are dead but he haspower over those who all their lives have been subject to him in the flesh.I will now ask how does any one present know what I say my wordshave a shape to them as much as this chair and the shape of my wordsgo to the drum of your Ear so that you get an understanding of what I say Now in speaking in the Tabernacle if I turn to the north the shape of my words strike the drum of the Ear & they understand it perfectlythe words strike the wall break the shape to peaces & the sound strikes theEar of those in the South as much as in the North but they do notunderstand what is said. Now if I had force of Lungs & power to throwthe shape of my words to China they would understand what I say as well as you do in the further part of this room they would hear it aswell. You know when you have a vision you can see as well all over your Body as out of your Eye. When Joseph had a revelation he had the Eyesof the Lord He saw as the Lord sees how did I know what was going onin Washington. I have known what was going on there all the time 
 31st Jan 1861And I know what is going on in other peoples Houses, I know itby the spirit of God it is revealed to me. Do spirits administer tous they do but we do not know it. Charles here will administer to his mother but she will not know it. these things are so orderedand governed that we may be tried and if Sister Little was todie & go whare her children are in the spirit world she would dojust so, she would not administered to her friends openly forshe would see that it was for a wise purpose that there was a veilbetween the living & the dead that the living might be tryed andhave a greater glory, the living cannot see the departed spiritsbut the departed spirits can see the living and administer tothem while they know it not. We are all in the spirit world &in Eternity but we know it not & do not comprehend it. My wife awoke in the morning that Charles died & said to me I thinkCharles Little is dead for I have seen him to night with Joseph ina dream and if Brother & Sister Little could see what I have theywould not wish him back. He was vary happy with Joseph andJoseph said he wanted him he had a particular place for him, and Helooked glorious. Many questions have arises in relation to the deathof children. Some have thought that it was ordained that children shoulddie. But this is not true doctrin it is not ordained of God that childrenshould die, but it is the will of God that all children should live and grow up to manhood & fill up the measure of there days if they coulddo it and overcome the evils they have to meet with in life butthey meet with so much of the Law of Death & so many Evils thatmany die in childhood & at all ages. you may ask why should notthey have a chance to prove themselves as well as we. As I said beforethere is a great variety the Human family die at all ages & children that die thwill have a fulness of glory they will be as happy as theyare capable of being, will they have another probation or chance of being tried as we are are I have many reflections upon thissubject but it is a doctrin I shall say nothing about. we shouldbe satisfyed with the principle that our children will be restodrestored to us again in their glorifyed bodies with the same statu[r]e that they were taken from us, and they will admin-ister to us though we know it not it is hid from us for a wise purpose 
 31st Jan 1861To give you a figure I will say to a man for instance if you will go to Big Cotton wood Blindfolded I will give you a reward of Tenthousand dollars but you cannot have it if you go with your Eyesopen to see the road, the man starts Blind folded fearing & tremblinglest he shall run a foul of wild cattle, into ditches, & difficulties, yethe gropes his way & gets through claims his reward & gets it so inthe dealings of the Lord with us He does not let us see every thing inthe future before us but makes us promises & makes us walk by faiththat we may obtain them and the greater our trials & conquests the greater will be our crown & glory. So all those who have beentried & got through do not wish to administer to us in that way that they will make it any lighter for us than it has been forthem that all may be tried alike as far as is consistent withthe Economy of GodJoseph Young followed then W Woodruff & E. D. Woolley I returned to the office & made this reportFebruary 1, 1861 ~ FridayFeb 1. I spent the day in the office I wrote a letter to G. A.

At Early candle light we met in the vestry of the Tabernacle to ordain the High Council many of the Priesthood were present Brother Taylor myself & Brother Farr ordained the 12 men a High Council in that Stake of Zion. We ordained 6 of them High Priests who were seventies I was informed that a list of names 
 10 Feb 1861was presented to President Young to pick out the High Council & He namedsix of them & Brother Farr nominated the other six after they were ordainedthe spirit & power of God rested upon me & I spoke to them about half an hour upon the subjet of the Priesthood & the magnifying of that Priesthoodand meeting all responsibilities required at hour hands all deeply felt thepower of God that was present I exhorted them to temperance & every goodword & work which would exhalt them before God. Elder Taylor followed& made some good remarks. We went to Brother Wests & spent the nightFebruary 11, 1861 ~ Monday[FIGURE] 11th Bishop Wests took us into his sleigh and drove us to South Webber whare we had an appointment to regulate that Branch of the Church the Bishop was in apostacy & was leading away others, they had got away othersa New Prophet to slide out of the Church upon. We had a large assembly of saints from other Places. Bishop Cook came in & opened the way by singing & Prayer I then called upon Bishop Richard Cook to speak and requested him to tell us his feelings if he believed in Joseph Morris as a Prophet to tell us so, & to tell us what his feelings were in relation to thePresidency of the Church. He arose & spoke some time without touching the subject. I again requested him to come to the point He then "said "yes I do Believe in Richa Joseph Morris as a Prophet whom God has raised upto lead this Church & Kingdom agreeable to the Revelation in the Doctrins & Covenants which says I will raise up unto you a Prophetlike unto Moses &c [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:16##] I do not Believe that Brigham Young is a prophet or has ever had any revelation or inspiration more than any sectari-an Priest, & I believe this Church will ownly be known in name in 10 years unless God does raise up a Prophet." When he closed several of his party got up & Bore the same testimony we then sent for there fals Prophet & called upon him to speak, he spoke about half an hour He said Brigham Young was not a prophet & Joseph Smith did not hold the Keys of the Priesthood & was ordained of man while He Joseph Morris was ordained of the Father, & held six times more keys of the Priesthood than Joseph did He said he was the seventh Angel, & much other nonsens he Presented before the Assembly, when He got through Elder Taylor spoke to the Assembly & showed tbrother Cook the Position He was in. He boretestimony that Brigham Young was a prophet of God & he said that He him-self was more of a Prophet than Morris was. Brigham Young in saying 
 11 Feb 1861that He did not profess to be a prophet seer & Revelator as Joseph Smith was, was speaking of men being born Natural Prophets & Seers many have the gift of seeing through seer stones without the Priesthood at all He had not this gift naturally yet He was an Apostle & the President of the Church & Kingdom of God on the Earth and all theKeys of the Holy Priesthood & of Revelation was sealed upon him & the spirit & power of Revelation was upon him daily when He closed I spoke to the people & bore testimony to the truth of what Elder Taylor had said. Morris had been cut off from the Church twice for Adultery in the Territory And He had spent about one year witha woman whose husband was crazy. I told morris that He was not a Prophet of God Neither was He the seventh Angels that when the7th Angel came to Earth He would not spend the first year of his mission with a woman whose Husband was crazy & commit Adultery with Her. I showed the folly of Richard Cook & others following such a man. When I closed my remarks Morris Denyed of Being with that woman. Bishop West arose & bore testimony that what I had said was true. We then took all the Names of the persons who professed to believed in Joseph Morris as the prophet of Godraised up to lead the Church. there was 16 Names Given as followsRichard Cook William Kendall Nels Morrison Mrs Hannah Cook John Cook Robert Farley Nathan Brooks Mrs Margaret Cook John Firth John Parsons John Trolsom Mrs Hellen CookMrs Sarah Cook Mrs Mary Cook Mrs Joanna KendallJohn Taylor then moved that those sixteen named persons be cut off from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I seconded the motion & they were cut off from the Church withouta disscenting voice. We then Nominated Philo Allen to Preside over the remainder of that Branch of the Church which was carried unanimously we also voted to unite that Branch to Ogden under the charge of the President & Bishop of that Place.

 13 1860I am not a Bishop, but in a Bishops meeting and I feel like saying afew words as President Young has given liberty. It matters not to me whether the lash hits me or you in the reproofs given by PresidentYoung, I feel to thank God that we are blessed with a leader who has indipendence of mind sufficient to do the will of God let it reprove or rebuke who it may. He asks no odds of any kingdom, Nations, peopleperson or thing who stands in the way of his doing his duty. It is aBlessing to us that we have a leader who have Eyes to see for us when we arein danger ourselves and if we had not some one to warn us and reproveus when we do wrong we would not be safe. President Young is sustained by the power of God and when he calls upon us to do any thing we oughtto do it, and if we withhold we do it to our hurt. the Elders in Englandhave beged of the people, untill they have bound them in chanes andkept them there in poverty if the Elders had pursued a wise coursethere are thousands who are now in England who would this dayhave been in Zion, then let us go to & fit out the missionaries andstop there begging from the poor.

 September 23, 1860 ~ SundaySept 23 1860Sunday I attended a Funeral of Sister Nancy Kent the oldest sisterof Brigham Young she died Sept 22nd 1860 Aged 74 years old 3rd Aug 1860John was 69, May 22nd May 1860 Phineas 61, 16 Feb 1860,Joseph 7th April 1860, 64 years old Brigham was 59, June 1, 1860, Lorenzo 54, 19, Oct 1860.Meeting opened By singing "Ear long the veil" vPrayer By Joseph YoungJohn Young then spoke and said v [I] fell [feel] to acknowledge the Hand of God in this thing. I dont fell this to be a matter of mo^u^rning though we feelto mis the society of our Friends when taken away, but we must follow our sistersoon, and I pray that I may be as well prepared as she is. Nancy was theoldest of the Family and the last of the sisters that was taken away she is inher 75 year 57 years since she was married and she has always beena good woman and always kind to all. I dont know as I ever knew her get out of the way she hag [had] good gifts and she received the gospel the firsttime she recieved itherd it she has been faithful to the last and now gone to the spirit world I have not the power to make manifest that which is inme we must do the best we can in this life & in the next we shallreceive a fulness but before I go home I want to have my work done so that I can breath out my spirit in peace into the Hands of God. Iwant to use my time so that I have nothing to repent off. I want tolive to do my work for If we leave our work to be done by somebody els to do it will be a long time before it is done Like an Elder going on amission leaves work to be done By some one Els it is undone.Phineas Young said I have been Edified in what has been said yet there has been Nothing said that I want to say, when my Friendsdie I want to speak of them If I was to say which of my sisters isthe best I coold not tell, the last is gone, and the Brothers have got to follow but I dont know who will go first. But if I was to make a choice & chuse the one that has done the least good in the world or the one that wasstill likely to do the least good on the Earth it would be myself. I wouldlike to go to the spirit world & be with my sisters I dont expect to do muchgood in this life yet I feel that I have done about the best I could. I dont want to live my life over again to try to Better it for Idont expect I should. I dont want to live any longer than it isthe will of God I should 
 Sept 23 1860Joseph Young spoke gave a good exertation but I have lost theminutes for the presentBrigham Young spoke and said I dont want to say much at thistime though I reflect much & could say a good deal. I expet that it will appear a Novel thing for a man to preach the funeral sermon of his wife or sister or any of his own Family but I hadrather preach the funeral sermon of my own Family or call uponmy Brothers to do it than to call upon any body Els. there is afear or trembling in the departure of the spirit from the body becauseit is attended with pain I have no fear of Being dead or beingin the spirit world but there is a fear in dying because of painHence their is a terror in death, but no fear in having my spiritfree but to get there is hard work. If the children of men was in possession of the truth concerning Eternal things they would not cling to life as they do. you know my feelings about mans singing & doing wrong. I have been kept from Evil, sin, & suffering evenin all the mobing I have escaped whiping imprisionment and sufferingand I feel that I have greater resason to rejoice I dont knowthat is because I am more righteous than other men But I have greater reason to rejoice than other men in this thing. Sister Nancywas a good woman I never knew her get angry in my lifeor do wrong she would have done much good in her day if she had a chance she has benen chained as it were but she has saved her-self & her husband and I think others, I dont wish her back again. nor do I want to live my life over again neither do Iwant any of my sisters to return I do not wish to keep the people longerLorenzo Young said there is a difference in men some were preparedfor the gospel others not. I dont care how rough my life may beif I do the best I can. I was with Nancy a good deal and her last words were Hosannah glory to God she wanted to say more but herspeech failed. I do not wish to say much let us do good and shunEvil that we may not bring sorrow upon ourselves. I have often though[t]what would be the situation of many that have had great light andfallen away so that they could have no redemption there situationmust be awful. it has been great Joy to Nancy to be with BrotherBrigham & her friends, may God Bless us all is my prayer Amen

Thesubject of Orson Pratt came up again concerning his fals doctrinPresident Kimball wished him to make satisfaction to President YoungBut President Young said he did not wish him to make any acknowled-ments to him Brother Pratt was strangely constituted he had acquireda good deal of knowledge upon many things but in other things he wasone of the most ignorant men he ever saw in his life He was full of integ-rity & would lie down & have his head cut off for me or his religin if necessary but he will never see his Error untill he goes into thespirit world then he will say Brother Brigham how foolish I wasNow Brother Pratt thinks that he and all the gGods will be learningfor many millions of years but by & by will know all things & allwill know it alike & that will be the End of their Exhaltations & knowledgehe cannot see the folly of forming this opinion here in the flesh& in his ignorance. But a thousand years hence he will see the follyof it I will hold on to Brother Pratt & all these my Brethren ofthe Twelve (notwithstanding all their sins, folley, & weaknesses) untill Imet with them in my Fathers kingdom, to part no more becausethey love God and are full of integrity. Brother Pratt said I do not believe as Brother Brigham & Brother Kimball do in some points of doctrin& they do not wish me to acknowled to a thing that I do not believeBrother Brigham said No you cannot see the truth in this matter untillyou get into the spirit world. Brother Brigham spake vary comforting words to the 12 He said his love for them was far above women & I wishyou could all say it.

He gave a short address He said the gentile chain was broaken & they would never put their yoke again upon the neck of the saints or church & Kingdom of God to all Eternity if we would do our duty He blessed the Saints, and gave instruction to the sisters upon the subject of wearing Hoops. He said when we followed that custom we followed the custom of Hores & prostitute women and all who ware large hoops expose themselves and show there folly He advised the Sisters to lay them aside He gave good advice to all & hadmuch of the spirit of the Lord He said we might build as many Halls as we pleased & we should not find any place whare we shouldfeel as well & have as much peace as we did in that Hall & he warned the brethren not to attend balls or parties in the world with the gentiles for then you are upon the gentile ground & the devils ground & he will have power over you But if I invite Gentiles to attend a party here they are under my controll & the spirit of the Lord governs & the Gentiles have to be subject to it but go to a Ball of there getting up & you become subject to them in spite of all you can do then let it Entirely alone.
