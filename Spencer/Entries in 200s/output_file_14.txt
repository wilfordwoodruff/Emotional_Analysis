Dear Brother:  Replying to your favor of 3rd, inst., would respect- fully state that at the time the application for pass in favor of Brother Isaac M.

Thus far we have issued passes to the Quorom of the Twelve to some  Stake Presidents and their Counselors and a few others, and we find that the list far exceeds our expectations. It is probably needless to tell  you that the number of passes in Utah has been very great, and that the Railways are not earning what is necessary to satisfy the owners, hence our instructions to retrench wherever possible. I regret it will not be consistent at this time to issue pass to Bro. Waddell.  Yours very truly, James Sharp asst, General Superintendent. ENDENTRY Sept 6 1889 James M.
