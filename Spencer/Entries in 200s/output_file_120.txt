Feb 13 That Book makes out william smith according to Mother  Smith's statement to be full of the Holy Ghost and the power  of God while at the same time I herd him say in the  presence of Joseph Smith was a  prisioner in the hands of his enemies and I said that God  would deliver him, william smith said Dam him Joseph  Smith ought to have been hung up by the neck years ago  FIGURE and Dam him he will get it now any how.   President Brigham Young said wm smith is the most  wicked man I ever saw in my life He has been filled  with all manner of wickedness. When I was in Nauvoo  I commenced to build me a carriage william got up a rumor  that I was Finishing a carriage for my own use which  Joseph had commenced for his mother then Mother Smith  soon reported that I was building her a carriage and  the first time she got me in company she asked me  for that carriage I did not care much about the carriage  but I was sorry to have her take that course. w woodruff remarked that Mother Smith was under the influence of wm  smith and the spirit of Aposticy which was in Nauvoo. President  Young said yes I do not think the Lord would impute Evil to her  and I shall meet with her in Eternity and I am sure I shall  not bring an Accusation against her. Elder O Pratt published  that work and bought it of A. W. Babbitt at a high Price when we had a copy of it in our office, it is marvellous that He  should have published it without my council. Many other  remarks were made by President Young (see private Journal) I met with the Twelve in the prayer circle I opened by prayer  G.

Brother Bigler had  written a letter upon the subject said that Balantyne had  taught that Haywood was the President of the place and that Balantyne  had privately thaught the people that Brigham Young would be massacreed bey the armey andc. The Twelve decided after Hearing  the case that they would dismiss Elders Heywood and Balantyne  from any further missionaryies duties at Present and G. A.

President Young said  their was a Hand Bill stuck up in the city for a Ball with  Thomas Williams Name to it, I have had a ticket or invi- tation to go to the Ball and it is rumoured that Col Johns- on would attend, but if Col Johnson waits for me to make  a Ball and bear the expenses of it and invite him to in in  order to see him He will wait a good while And if Col  Johnson is the man I take him to be I do not think He will  come over to Join these Rowdies in their Ball. There is  many of this Church who does not know the diference  between inviteing our Enemies, the Gentiles, ^or^ the wicked to  Join in our feast or dances, or gioing to their parties and being under their dominion. If we invite a wicked man to  our dance we preside over him. If we go to his party He  presides over us and has an influence over us. If Col  Johnson will stay whare he is and maintain his own Group I have no objection I mean to stay whare I am and main- tain my own Ground by the help of the Lord   I met with the Twelve in the circle C.

There was  Present E. T. Benson  F. D. Richards   O Hyde opened by Prayer and spoke upon our position  and the day in which we live said the gospel had been  beging among the Gentiles for 30 years and he believed the  time was soon over he believed the time was at hand when the  Gentiles would beg for the Gospel   G. A. Smith Prayed in the spirit of the Lord and asked  for all things necessary for the Church and kingdom of God  the salvation of the Presidency, Twelve, our family and all Israel  and the destruction of our Enemies    We then sung come all ye that love the Lord   O pratt Prayed that the Holy Ghost might be poured out  upon us, that our hearts might be filled with good desires  that we might be taught to pray and what to ask of the Lord  we then sung O our Father thou that dwellest   ENDENTRY Feb 21st W Woodruff prayed and called upon the Lord to pour  out his spirit upon us and give us the gifts of the Holy Ghost  to Bless and preserve all Israel who would keep the comma- ndments of God and to curse and destroy our Enemies who would not repent but seek our destruction    We sung this Earth was once a Garden Place    Erastus Snow spoke said he felt rather stupid but he had a great desire to enjoy the Holy spirit. He talked as stupid as he felt, and I thought rather Quenched the spirit, but he  prayed and asked for many things which were good   Hyde first remarked  that in attempting to pray this morning his tongue was all  doubled up and seemed hard work to speak O Pratt said that  it made him think of Brother Whitmer before he saw the Angels he had to struggle hard with the powers of darkness and in one instance the Devel appeared in the form of a  personage and he had to contend with that person and overcome him, then an angel of God appeared to them Joseph said that  Moses was visited by the Devil and He said to Moses son of  Man worship thou me He told the Devil that He was a son of God and he would not worship him soon the Lord appeared to him   C. C. Rich recommended that no one speak unless he had the spirit of God but to pray then we would have a good meeting  several ingaged in the conversation.   O. Pratt said there is one thing I think would be of advan- tage to us in prair the Lord has said that whare two or  three agree as touching any thing it shall be given you He  said we should cast in our minds what the spirit would wish us to ask for, then we should agree and all ask for the same thing and exercise all the faith we could upon that  one thing, now if we asked for a hundred things and all diferent it does not seem as likely to be answered as though we asked  for a few things the Nephites when Jesus appeared to them  asked for the Holy Ghost and it was given them   O Hyde said the He must confess that he was more  stupid and dull than He wished to be he thought it was in  consequence of going without food and tobaco, which he  had been in the habit of useing. He said if we get the spirit  of the Lord and pray in the spirit we shall be agreed    W. Woodruff spoke and said that we were living in an impo- rtant eria and that God required much at our hand as the Quorum  of the Twelve Apostle, the Heavens were full of Judgment for  the wicked and Blessings for the Righteous, and the Lord has said  that He would be inquired off theby the House of Israel to do thoes Blessings for them we should be united in asking for what we  want and we should go before God and ask him to stay our Enemies  and hold them that they shall have no power over us we may   ENDENTRY Feb 21st not be confined to one thing we want the Holy spirit and we will  ask for that and we will ask the Lord to Hold the congress of the  United States and all our Enemis in that way that the will of God may be done He said this year would be more filled with Judgments upon the  wicked than any year we have seen and 1860 will be far more so  E. T. Benson said that He fasted 3 days and was blessed in int and thought we should not be discoraged but fast and Pray and  ask the Lord for what you want. Now if we use coffee, tobaco  whiskey, and stuff ourselves ^with^ meat we will be like the Gentiles and can- ot expect much of the spirit unless we prepare our bodies for it  I believe that Good will grow out of this meeting    Pratt is  that we be united in what we ask for but not to limit us I  know that we want the Holy spirit. And one of the Greatest Gifts that we want is wisdom to help us to use the Holy spirit  when we pray we want a great deal of wisdom to know when  to speak and when to be silent, as to the congress of the United States  their is not ten men but what want to cut the throats of the  Presidency and Twelve Apostles and I want to Pray God to curse  them and give them No power over us and I want to pray for the  removal of the armey. Joseph Smith wrote his ^dedication pray^ prayer and went  and read it to the assembly and some were tryed with it   We all dressed in our robes. Lorenzo Snow prayed and F D. Richards was mouth and prayed long and asked  for many things ^for^ the Church and Kingdom of God    The Brethren then spent a short time in mixed conversation  concerning the the death of Joseph and other things. we then  adjourned till tomorrow 10 oclok, ^1/2 past 3^ I spent the evening at home  I met in the evening with my family and taught them the  things of the kingdom.

A. Smith  F. D. Richards   Elder Taylor opened by Prayer and asked the Lord for all  things nessary for the saints    O Hyde wrote a note to H. C. Kimball giving him an invitactoon  to meet with us    we conversed upon variosus subjets till 1 oclok  we then sung A poor wayfareing man of grief    E. T. Benson Prayed and called upon the Lord for his  Blessings upon all the Authorities of the Church and upon  all Zion and for the Holy spirit to be poured oput upon us  and for the Lord to hedge up the way of our Enemies that  they shall have no power over us   ENDENTRY 22nd  we then sunag come let us Anew our Journey persue   O. Hyde Prayed in the spirit of the Lord and asked for evry blessi- ng upon the Church and Kingdom of God which the free spirit of  the Lord dictated unto him   Erastus Snow spoke concerning the feelings of many of  the people against seeing the Twelve prosper in Temperal things He thought if the Lord did not sanction this, He permited it to be and he thought perhaps it was not the will of God that we should  be engaged in Temperal business when I was ordained Brother Brigham told me to lay down my hoe and all farming tools and labouring in the ministry and I do not prosper in any temperal business F. D Richards said he Brother Snow had spoken his feelings exactly he did not feel like engaging in any temperal Business    C. C. Rich spoke upon the same subject and said that He did not no as all the Twelve all experienced the same thing but I think the people are exercised by a spirit othat they do not comprehend or know what it ment but their is an opposition to Joseph and the Presidency and Twelve against their prosperity. I think we should use wisdom in the preservation of our bodies and lives we have received a gospel and principles which will save us, but we must apply it to our bodies as well as to our souls in the season thereof in order to be saved.   Brother C. C. Rich called upon the Lord in prayer and asked the Blessing of God upon us    Lorenzo Snow spoke, was thankful to meet with us and when He herd of it thought he would undergo a great deal in order to meet with us, if we did not have those great and marvellous things that was manifest on the day of Pentecost yet it was good to meet and pray and while our Enemies are seeking our overthrow we should call upon God for our protection we are  differently situated from the Ancient Apostles they had not the kingdom of God to build up as we have. Now the power seems to be assimulated among the people and not confined to one or two men or Twelve yet I consider Brigham Young is performing a greater work in saving providing and orga- nizing his family, in the way he has than he would to divide the waters, or heal the soals, cast out Devils, or do other miracles and the wisdom of God is with him with regard to our atten- ding to temperal matters I think we shall have to attend to temporal matters and understand them in order to build up the kingdom of God, I have no dout but that if Bishop Hunter would take care of our Families and we do nothing els No doubt we should be great and powerful men in spirit and make the hearts of men tremble and be filled with the power of God but would this benefit the people more than for us to know how to teach the people in temperal things    O Hyde said I have thought of the subject as Erastus spoke of  but I have thought it was best for us to take a medium course we must have cares and if we could do as Bishop Hunter spoke of we might become dry and dull I believe we shall   ENDENTRY have a variety sometimes fat and sometimes lean and sometimes noth ing we shall have trials but I think we ought to do our duty   magnify our calling and trust in God and all will be right I believe the day is not far off when the Twelve will have all that is necessary. He related a dream about Bullion and gold andc. J Taylor said I will prophesy that it shall be fulfilled Lorenzo Snow said I will prophesy that the Moon is made under which it shall be fulfilled. O Hyde said I will Prophesiy that the time will soon come when we shall have all that we want    Sessions settlement He said he had paid $5 for one load of maple wood of the Bishop that is all that I had in that settlement.   we had a mixed conversation upon the subject before us we finally concluded to fulfill our mission ^first^ and be industrious and provided for our families as well as we can and then trust in God    ENDENTRY February 23, 1859 ~ Wednesday   23rd The Twelve met in the Prayer closset at the  O. Hyde E. T. Benson F. D. Richards   O Hyde made a statement of his doings in New Yourk at the Time that Roberts was overturning the church through fals doctrin. The course was sustained by Joseph Smith His instruction to the Twelve was read. B. Young said that when any one of the Twelve was abroad it was their  duty to preside and regulate all things   O Hyde Prayed in the spirit of the Lord and then spoke said he wished the brethren would pray and aske for those things which we want and contend for it untill we obtain I feel as though we shall not always be kooped up here I do not believe we shall always be together but the Lord will call ous out we have a work to do in the Earth the Lord has said "with you I will rend their Kingdom, saidth the Lord" will this be done while we are here, we must pray for the spirit of God to be with us   At a quarter to 12 oclck D. H. Wells called * H. C. Kimball said this madtoe me think of the time when I returned from James illegibleFoster ^was president^ and the presidency of the Seventies ^they^ had met with a seers stones to see what they could see when I went in they treated me vary cool and Z Pulsipher said dont be excited Brother Kimball is Nothing but a man, they treated me vary cooly and I went home and wept* The 12 all rose up and shook hands with them and recieved them Joyfully   O Hyde explained to Brothers Kimball and Wells what we had done, and would like to hear from them   Brother Kimball said I consider evry ruling man in the Church that has the Holy Ghost is a prophet seer and Rev- elator and he should have the spirit of that office   ENDENTRY Feb 23  G. A. Smith Read ^from the Doctrin and Covenants the duty^ the Authority of the Twelve Apostles Br  Kimball said it was plain. The Nations were spoken of whare the layws were so hard that the saints could not enjoy the gospel openly. F. D. Richards spoke of esstablishing several Branches in Dresden in a secret manner through the mercy of God    Brother Kimball conversed upon a variety of things refered to the stakes which the Twelve once set to see an Angel but we did not seen an angel but prayed ourselves into darkness He spoke of the time that Joseph tried the Twelve but the Twelve was united and tied Joseph down and Joseph said now dont you now never let any body tie you down as you have me. Brother Kimball said we appointed ^Joseph nominated^ G. A Smith to take the place of Lyman Shermon was appointed to take the place of Orson Hyde But Brother Sherman ^was vary^ was taken sick and died in 3 days ^shortly illegible after^ Brother G. A. Smith said when he heard of Brother Shermons death He thought his time would soon come. Brother Kimball said "it was not the will of God for a man to take Brother Hydes place. The Twelve can ordain men to the Apostleship and give them all the power you have and you have all that we have got But you cannot make a prophet ownly the natural way and a man cannot be a patriarch and not a Prophet for a  man may have the spirit of a prophet before he can bless and prophets prophecy" The gifts and callings of God are without repentance there are thousands of prophets among the Gentiles and spiritualist that have not Repented or obeyed the gospel there are natural gifts to men if they would receive the gospel their gifts would be made more manifest G. A. Smith Red some in the Doctrins and Covenants, H. C. Kimball said I always believed that Lyman Wight would be saved. I never had any but good feelings towards him   Joseph Young came in at 1 oclok   President Brigham Young came in at a quarter past one oclok W Woodruff red the minutes. President Young said Brother Box said the Armey was wanting to get up a viga- lance committee and wanted to get my head. But they will not do it. well Brethren I called in to see you a minute I supposed you called meet to gether to know more, well I wish we all understood our calleding and ministry before  God. At the time Brother Kimball speaks of the Twelve We  praid untill it was so dark we could hardly see to get down stairs I then ^last time I met with the Twelve in Kirtland^ I praid to God with all my heart that I might never again meet with that Quorum and I never did I dont want you to run in to the same thing with the spirit they possessed Brethren I will say one thing to you that you should understand that evry minute of our lives we should watch vary carefully evry thought act and word in such a manner as not to grieve the spirit of God. I do not know how your feelings are here but when you close you should ask what advantage it has been to you and if you have gained any ^thing by^ profit by it if you meet for past time to pray for your friends and Enemies that is right, but if you meet to fast and pray and call upon the   ENDENTRY Lord for special Blessings you will have to be vary careful not to indulge in light or vain conversation because it will grieve the spirit of the Lord. I met with the various quorums of the Church and many of the councils of the Church are like  the door upon its hinges we are as we were, But we should improve by every opportunity we have. He then left us Brother Young has opened the way I will say the less you to meet to gether to talk over matters the less better it will be for you, to meet and complain of one another and of the Presidency, or the people it is not profitable for you and if I had been in Brother Woodruff's Place I would not have red what he has I would not have written them.   Brother Kimball said bear with me untill I get through and be kind to me and I will be kind to you and if you will always take my council you will find it will lead you into the kingdom of God and that you will not find in Books   The Brethren spoke in social conversation upon a variety of subjects. Brother Hyde said I will remark concerning the object of our meeting it was not to get cloven tungs to set upon us of fire but it was to convers and pray together and ask the Lord to preserve us and to overthrow our enemies, we have stuck our stake but was glad to have the Presidency come in with us   H. C. Kimball said I will predict in the Name of Jesus Christ if you will be one with the Head, the Presidency and sustain them and you will never see the Body of Christ moved or disturbed I do not mean members but the Body, untill the coming of Christ and if you will be one with the Presidency not any of you or the Presidency shall fall by the Armey or By the Gentiles But you shall all be crowned in the presence of God you are connected with all the prophets and Apostles from the Begining and they are united with us and will sustain us if we do our duty, And we shall never be broaken up if we will be united all Hell cannot move us you unite with the presidency and have an Eye to the head all the time, and sust- ain the Head and no power will prevail over us. I have the best of feelings towards this Quorums if these two Quorums ownly Just stands together the kingdom will stand and prosper go to and prune yourselves and begin at the root Brother Brigham told it that we should not do any thing but what we know is right   Brother Wells said I rejoice to meet with you I was glad to hear that you was going to meet I feel like a little child among you you have more experience than I have I offten fell not qualifyed to fill my calling but by the grace of God I fell to try to do my duty but one thing I no it is the work of God and if any of us get in the way it will rooll on without us for the Lord will carry it on. I have a great desire to have the spirit of God so that evry act thought and word may be except- able before the Lord we should triy to healp Brother Brigham I have tryed to help him and have been called upon by him to do many things that I thought many others was Better Qualifyed   ENDENTRY Feb 23 to attend to But I have done it freely and for that things I believe it has been excepted I am thankful to see the Twelve and Presidency so well united and the friendship and confidence the Twelve  have in me this is our safe guard the devil has not the power over us that many think when we are united we should try to keep the devil out of our houses and out of ourselves sometime we may have a member in our houses who will let the devil dwell in their tabernacles we cannot always help this but if we are firm before the Lord we will gain ground untill we will bind the devil and cast him out of our houses and finally out of the church I feel to Bless you my Brethren this Quorum of the Twelve Apostles with evry feelings of my heart in the Name of Jesus Christ and by all the Authority that God has given me let us be up and doing and feed the flock of God the saints are weak many of them, and are tempted and tryed and they wanted feeding and if you see any thing in me that is wrong I wish you would come to me and tell me esspecially I should be much oblieged to you to tell me any fault before you tell anybody  els. I consider it is a great blessings to belong to the Chiurch of Christ I never did ask for any office in the Church of Christ I want to be passive in the hands of God. I never did have those great manifestations that some have I have thought that I would like to have some of those manifestations if it was the will of God but not if it is agoing to do me any harm I would not wish to see an Angel or hear the voice of God if it would make me apostitize or do me an injury but let us act for to day and we will have all the Blessings that is necessary for us   O Hyde said I believe and I may almost say I know that  there is not a feeling among the Twelve against the Presidency and do not offerd up a prayer without asking God to Bless the presid- ency and call them by name.   The question was asked had we not better met hear evry thursday to fast. Brother Kimball said I thing if you will meet with the people you will have more of the spirit of God than to meet here   President Kimball dismissed us and Blessed us in the name of Jesus Christ and said we should be blessed and the spirit of good should be with us and be with our wives, and it should rest upon the Earth around about us and these are the begining of Good Better days    ENDENTRY February 24, 1859 ~ Thursday   24th A cold wind I spent the fore part of the day in the office we read  washington and ordered it to be recorded in the Journal of the Twelve Apostles I spent the day in the offic on History    ENDENTRY February 25, 1859 ~ Friday   25 I spent half of the day in the office on History.

But their is not a man in the world who can  sware in truth that President Young advised anyone  to murder any body he has always advised evry man  when he has advised at all not to shed Blood except in  self defence. It is a vary cold day I wrote some today to Johnson  has 100 deserters in Irons in his camp and he had one  man whiped 120 lashes on the bare back who swore he would kill the man who sentenced him to be whiped as  soon as he got a chance, we learned that the snow was  vary deep south and their had been No communication with  any settlement south of Fillmore for several weeks   I had two dreams last night.

Taylor Hunter Hunter and many Bishops and Elders they sung "O My Father thou  that dwellest." O Pratt Prayed. Another Hymn was sung Elder O. Pratt then addressed the People. And said what I may say I do not know, but I hope I may be led to say  what will be for the best. Since I came here my eyes have been saluted with one thing, and that is that death has power over all things that we see. we are called upon to part with our best friends and have them taken away from us what  we now see in death, and what has happened from the Beginning in like manner will all the millions who now dwell upon the  whole Earth will be called to pass through the same change. If we  had no knowledge of God we should feel vary diferent from what  we now do. If we thought our bodies would lie in the dust and never be raised again we should have great cause to mourn   ENDENTRY March 31st but we have learned that the being which inhabits this Tabernacle  will live forever and not die. we have to lay our tabernacles in the dust but they will again be resurrected with an immor- tal body for Jesus Christ through his death and sufferings restored unto all the children of men the privilege of the resurrec- tion of their bodies, and if we keep a celestial law we shall have a celestial Resurrection but all the righteous and the wicked will have their bodies again. we cannot imagin the greatness of the glory of the saint of God after the resurrection. Notwithstanding all that our bodies suffer in this life in pain sorrow and distress  the want of food andc still we cling to them and do not wish to give them up. we do not realize the great difference there is in being in this world or probation and the next all the knowledge we formerly had was taken from us when our spirits took these  bodies some think we never did exist till we came here because we cannot remember any thing neither can we remember any  thing of the first year or two of our existence yet our spirits remained in our bodies as much as they do now but as soon as  our spirits leave these imperfect tabernacles or rather bodies cloged with mortality and evil our spirits will be in lively reco- llection of evry thing that took place with us before we came  here and all things appertaining to us since we came in this world. It is right for us to take proper care of our bodies and  do right and when we have done that we should leave all in the  hands of God and not be over anxious for our lives for if we are faithful I expect we shall be raised in the morning of the first  Resurrection. And if we expected to be crowned Kings and  Priests and sit upon thrones we want experience in this world and  the next in order to be prepared for thes things. If we were  to be judged by the knowledge we once had before we came here it would not be right, for we have to be judged according to the light we have and if we break the Law of God after having  received great light and knowledge, our condemnation would be accordingly. when the righteos come forth with their resur- rected bodies, they will have great Joy in the remembrance  of their faithful deeds while the wicked will have great sorrow in the rememberence of their wicked deeds, and the persecu- tion of the saints, their sorrow will be increased a thou- sand fold while the Joy of the saints will be a thousand fold It has been thought by some that when the spirit leaves the body that will never be called upon to labour either befor or  after the resurrection, but I believe that all the children of God will be called to perfore duties through all Eternity as great as they are capable of performing, that they may continue to receive the blessings of their Father in heaven   Those who lived and died before the coming of Christ who were  faithful received their resurrected Bodies after Christ arose  and if you are faithful you will also have your resurrected  bodies at the second coming of Christ and when we  come to meet with them we can then tell our labours and  toils over together each in their generation, and if they  had persecution so have we, and if they were driven from their homes and had perils for Christ sake so have we and we can be mutual in our communication together   ENDENTRY March 31 And the Zion on the Earth will ere long metet with the Zion of Enoch and there we will greet each other and we shall have such Joy as we have never seen on the Earth President Heber C Kimball then spoke a short time He said in regard to what had been said by O. Pratt is all good. In regard to the abobe abode of departed spirits I have no doubt but this wourld will stand forever. Jesus says in this world ye have tribulation but in me ye have pease, But I am going to say a few words about Sister Mary W Woolley, we call her dead she is dead in one sense, but not ^in^ another. I have known her before she was in the church, she is a good woman she has always stood by her husband and has been true to him and if she has been true in this life she will be in the next and have her reward which will be the case in the next probation with all. I believe in many Probation When Sister Woolley gets in the next probation she will sit down with Sarah and the ancient Holy woman as well as the Prophets and Apostles who have lived in this proba tion when they go into the spirit world they sit down with Abram and the Patraiarchs and Prophets. She has had many troubles in this life but she has got through them all and I am confident she will sit down with all the Holy men and women in the Eternal world. and will  remain with them Eternally. what she has past through she has done for salvation and she has stood it well and now has gone to rest, and I can say of a truth that I know that she is now well off and all is well off with her. She has sustained Brother Woolley in carrying out the doctrin of the  Patriarkal order of marriage and this because God had Had commanded it we have often herd President Young say that He did not enter into it because he likied it but because God had commanded it. If we had not done it we should have been damed. He commanded Marks and others to enter into it but they did not obey the word of the Lord and they have gone and denied the faith while we remain and God will sustain us here in the mountains, true yes it is as true as the sun, and those who are faithful will be saved sister woolley has been true and so has Brother Woolley and their sons and daughters have been true men and women and I say God Bless you Brother Woolley and your family and I Bless you all that are faithful But a curse will  come upon the Nation that has sought our destruction and as God lives what the nation seeks to bring upon us will be brought upon them so we must be patient, the  Lord has them in his power and they cannot move ownly as the Lord permits and God will regard all that we have done in the Temple of God and we will have to fully carry it out and if we have not done wrong or broaken our cov enants we shall receive all that has been promised unto us and all will be right And may God grant that all may come upon our Enemies that the Lord may wish to bring upon them.

Soon capt A. B. Miller of the firm of Wardle, Russell, Miller, andc called in to see President Young  and had quite a long interview with him. He said there  were two and a half Millions of Dollars worth of goods  at First cost on the road for this market there is more than 1000 waggons loaded with merchandize with 2 1/2  tons to the waggon. I think there is more than one  million dollars worth of good more than can be sold in this market for the next year. The western Merchants have been anxious to sell goods to come to this Market for they  paid up so well last year but they will not be as anxious  to sell to the transient Merchants next year for it will be  a long time before they will get their pay and I expect we shall  have to buy out the Merchants in this City before they get through  There is a vast amount of Cattle, Horses, Mules, waggons,  goods and people on the way to this Territory. Cattle will  be cheap this fall, though many young cattle will be driven through to Calafornia. Mr Miller said the people  estimated that the mormon Emigration alone will be 25000.  President Young said he did not think there would be  1000 Mormons, an Indians said all the white men  East were going to Utah. they pulled up some grass and asked  the Indian if he could tell whare it come from ior if He  would miss it from the field of grass before him. He said  No they told him it was so with the white men they were not missed whare they came from. Mr Miller thought  Mr Livingston Bell and Co. will loose some $20,000 $30000 or  their contract on Flour. President Young thought not, that they would by their flour for goods at a high price and would probably  samve themselves. Mr Miller said that much flour would   ENDENTRY July 1st be wanted ^He wanted^ flour to feed about 1500 men mostly at Bridger, many men who are on the way to Calafornia will come through here to get their flour. Mr Miller says that all Freight can now bye carried from St Joseph either via Rail Road or Steemer for 15 cents per hundred He said that a rail road would be in operation to Kansas City in two years   President Young said Mr Miller perhaps you can inform the people whether the Armey in this Territory belongs to Majors Russell Miller and Company, or the United States for many people are at a loss to know who it belongs to. Mr  Miller Did not answer Direct. President Young asked if  they were going to let us live a little longer here. He said yes the army will be reduced to 1000 men by fall we must keep them moving to keep money stiring. President Young said there is going to be a great sale of Mules they  will be sold cheap and go out bought back deear. Miller Nodded assent. Presidet Young said I under stand that you brought word that Stephen A Duglass stands Fair to be the candidate for the next President. Miller said He was sure to be the next President the South has to unite on him to get votes in the north so as not to get Defeted. If he is President I shall do business in this line for 5 years then I will  quit but Wardle will remain in Washington to regulate affairs there and attend to business. He said they had got the contract of carriying the Utah and Calafornoia Mail and has the whole controll of it and all the government transportation for the army. After some other Remarks Mr Miller took his leave.   After he left President Young Remarked that I cannot tell what to believe by what Mr Miller says, He talks so much he does not expect to be believed in all he says, He has a motive in view in calling here he wants to lay a plan to make our boys his servants in carrying the mail if Wardle Majors and Co tell the Army to move to any place they will move for that company has  all the power in their hands except the buying of the flour Mr Miller Further said that Just before I left we received 2nd A telegraphic Dispach not to organize 1500 larg freidt freight waggons for New Mexico we sent word that they were to late for we were already organized Mr Russell  went immediately to washington to see what was up    ENDENTRY July 2, 1859 ~ Saturday   2nd Eckles {{saying that}} Col Johnson {{had said if the prisoners were not removed  soon he would turn them loose}}    ENDENTRY July 3, 1859 ~ Sunday   3rd Sunday I met with my Quorum in the morning Arsa Hinkley Prayed and R.

Dana He had made a statement while in Orson Pratt that when my life was preserved  on the night of the 5 day of July 1848 by moving my  carriage from an impression which I had to move it, also to move my mules from an oak tree standing beside the road, Both of which I done (see my Journal of July 5 1848) He says that He had the impression and urged me during the afternoon several times to do it he also sayes that my mules were turned out and not at the tree both of these statements are incorrect acor- ding to my best knowledge and belief and recollection and the account of my Journal, and testimony of my Journal written next morning and testimony of my wife and Dominicas Carter, both of which were present, I told Brother Dana that I considered his statement not true I havd no recollection of his saying any thing about it untill I named it to him, and I knew I moved my mules from the tree and tied them in a Hickory grove whare I found them in the morning He had been to the trouble of making a New Journal whare he had detailed the account at great length apparently to esstablish his version of the story But  I am of the impression that he has told the story so  often that He received a Revelation by which my life was preserved that He either believes it to be true or wishes to try to maintain what what He has stated so often. He did not move the waggon in which he slep himself and the tree fell in about 1 foot of it, I felt thankful to the Lord for preserving my life and I wish to give Brother Dana all the credit which belong to him in the affair But I have No recollection of his saying a word about it to me untill I named it to him Neither has any one who was with me any recollection of it this I told him and we parted both of firm in  our own belief I spent the afternoon in the office   ENDENTRY July 8, 1859 ~ Friday   July 8th  {{It is a cool morning.

I learned to day that Col Johnson sent an escort  of Cavelry to guard the prisioners out of the camp so they would not be mobed. President Young called at the  Office a short time Hoosesea Stout received a Letter from David McKenzie wrote a letter to requesting Him to come and plead his cause and bring such evidence as he thought  proper He was accused of Forgery. H Stout asked  President Youngs council. He said He did not wish to  talk about it but said The Lawyiers were not required   ENDENTRY July 11 by any law to go to that camp and he should not do it and if  He was his Lawyier he should advise him to let the Judges  do as they pleased at the examination and if I was in his  place I would Neither Deny nor Confess any thing but would  remain silent. if he is guity he ought to be Cuffed for  I have employed him for 2 years and paid him and helped  his family and for such a man to ingaged in such a business  I feel like spanking him they seek evry opportunity to  Hatch up an accusation against me. If MCKinzie will  tell the truth it will be all right as far as I am concerned  But if my enemies can get him to lie against me or any body els so they can make a war on me then their will  be a fight on hand and this will be as soon as the Lord will Brother Hosea wrote to MCKinzie that the holding of a court  at Camp Floyd in a military camp was illegal and contrary  to the instructions of Judge Bucannan  I shall not come to plead any cause in that camp   A man called upon President Young and informed him that he had found a good bed of stone colal on the Webber from  4 to 10 miles above the mouth of echo canyon He found three  veins of the coal about 3 feet each and the man is an old colyier  He ingaged to deliver to President Young 100 tons of coal at  $20 per ton    ENDENTRY July 12, 1859 ~ Tuesday   12 President Young called into Coand Commission Room provo and held a meeting  saw Brother Carns and told him that he herd that He  was Brain cracked and low spirited He said that it was  true and any man that could be shut up in a dirty sell as long as I was with some 25 drunken Irish who were  cursing, swearing, fighting, spewing, and shitting and trampling  over me without being Brain cracked and down spirited then  He has a stronger spirit then I have I vomited many  times nearly all there was in me. H Stout said that Cradlebaugh  and Buchannan and Judge Black. But whatever they done Stout said they would  Be mean themselves. President Young dreamed a few  nights since that He saw those Judges drunk and they behaved  as ^bad as^ they could evry thing they done was dirty and filthy The Probate court has been in session about four weeks and  Adjourned to day senedi. I spent the day in the office    ENDENTRY July 13, 1859 ~ Wednesday   July 13th I went over Jordon and staked out my grass ground  and went to the Young and D H Wells in the office President Young invited me to meet at his House at 2 oclok as He was going to have an interview with Horace Greely I met agreeable to invitation  I Found Mr Greely A singular looking man He  was midling well dressed white but bald Headed his  head vary dirty looked as though He had not washed  his Head since He came off the plains He had quite  a feminine soft green appearance He asked many Question   ENDENTRY July 13th Questions Asked By Brigham Young   At 2 oclock P.M. The following Persons met at President Youngs  upper Room H. C. Kimball  H Stout Elias Smith, and Horace Greely Editor  of the Tribune when the following conversation took place  after the company was introduced to Mr Greely by the  Hon J. M. Bernhisel. Also Brigham Young Jr was introduced But they soon left. Mr Greely asked President  Young what is the difference between your religion and Church from the Christian world. B. Y. The difference between us is that we believe that No Church is the Church of God who  has not the Holy Priesthood. We have the Priesthood and the sects of the day have not got it. The Lord has delivered the  Priesthood unto us and without the priesthood no man has auth- ority to administer in the ordinances of the gospel. G do you  believe in faith and what is it" B Y We do. Paul said it was  the substance of things hopede for and the evidence of things ^not seen^hoped for.  G. What do you Believe about slavery. B. Y. We believe what  the Bible sayes about it, there was a curse put upon Cain  and his seed and that curse will remain untill it wais taken  off they were to be servants. G is this a slave territory  or are there slaves here. Y There is slaves here or have been  from time to time. G Then this would become a slave state would it not if it was admitted. Y. No the climate and situ- ation would not admit of it. slavery is a thing I do not  want any thing to do with it. I consider it more of a course curse to a man to have slaves than a Blessing. G So I  think. do you tithe the people if so what for. Y. Yes one tenth to Build Temples, and to Feed the poor, and I  want you to understand one thing and I want you to write it just as I tell you and that is I do not have so much  as one cabbage or ear of corn of the tithing ownly what I pay for. G Do you have a salary. Y. No sir not one  cent. G Then how do you get your living. Y I would  think myself a poor financeer if I could not work  for Nothing and keep myself. There is No man from the Highest to the lowest in the Church that Has a salary. The  Presidency Twelve, Seventies and all the Elders who labour for  the interest of the Church do it without a salary the Elders  travel the world over as it were and go without purse or  scrip or money and all preach without a salary. While building  a Kirtland we had a committee of three who  spent there whole time they were allowed $1 per day each  man. We had a committee of three in building the  Nauvoo Temple they had $2 per day each. We I do not no know of any other who have a salary. Joseph Smith  once gave H. C. Kimball credit of $2 on Book for some  labour. Brother Kimball had it taken off said he would  not have a credit for it. We have appointed a committe of one Mr D H Wells here to superintend the building of a Temple here. He has No salary. I prefer a committe   ENDENTRY July 13  of one instead of any more to transact any kind of busines if I want to do it with dispatch then he does not have others to council but can act upon his own judgment we hire men ^and clerks^ to work in the Church who spend all ther time as day labourers we pay them wages. G. Do not the Bishops have salary's Y. No Sir. G. Are all the Mormons under obligation to gather together and upon what principl are they required to gather. Y Yes we consider ourselves under obligation to gather together By the comma- ndments of God the Bible teaches the subject of the Gathering in the last days. G we have understood that the Bible teaches the Jews to gather to old Jerrusalem Y. Yes and it also teaches the Saints to gather to Zion. G Do you  think there can be any collission between the Mormons and the United States. Y Not if they let us alone and do not persecute us more than we are able to bear, but they can croud us to a point which would make a collission G. What was the cause of so much oposition to Joseph Smith they accused him of stealing Horses and cattle and doing much Evil. Now the Methodist used to be much opposed and were vary unpopular But I do not recollect of hearing them accused of such crimes as the Mormons are I am vary unpopular in my religion I am a whole souled Universalist yet we are not accused of such crimes and I do not recollect that the Saints were in the days of Christ. B. Y I think sin if you will look  carefully at the History of Christ and the Apostles you  will find that all manner of Evil was spoken against  them falsly. As to Joseph Smith he was a good man and he was persecuted even unto death becasuse he did do good. He passed through over 30 law suits got up by his enemies and it was shown in evry instace that He was innocent and it was got up through persecution G What are the Danites and what information can you give me concerning them. Y I cannot give you any  information conserning them you will have to enquiring of our Enemies and they can tell you all about it, we know  nothing about any Danites we have no such society or company among us. G You are accused of many crimes Y And so were the saints in the days of Christ and the Apostles evry exertion has been made from the begining to Bring some accusation against us while trying Joseph in Missouri before Judge A King. He asked Joseph if he believed in the setling of the kingdom in the last days that the prophet Daniel spoke of Joseph said he believed what the Bible said about it the Judge said clerk put that down that is treason Col Dona- phan who was Josephs Lawyier said you had better make the bible treason and don with it. In the days of Christ the Jews said if we let him alone he will come and take away our state and Nation that is what our enemies are afraid of now that we shall esstablish the Kingdom of God G do you believe in infant sprinkling. Y. No we baptize Believers By ememersion. G do you believe in any New   ENDENTRY July 13 new doctrin Y no none ownly what the Bible and Book of mormon teaches, have you not read the Book of Mormon G But vary  little of it. How extensive are miracle in the Church and are  they confined to the leaders of the Church. Y They are as extensive as it is the will of God to give they arne not confined to the Head But all Elders lay hands upon the sick when  called upon and the sick are often healed. G yes but some die I suppose. Y Yes the saints and sinners have died in every age. Death has passed upon all mankind and they cannot escape it. G Your doctrin of Polygamy is not that  against the Bible. Paul said A Bishop should have one wife Y. that is correct Doctrin you should not take a single man for a Bishop he should at least have one wife But Paul did not say that he should not have but one there is nothing in Pauls words against his having a dozen G. How many wives has any one man had in the Church B. Y. I suppose I have as many as any one man I have some 15 I have some aged women sealed to me upon the principle of sealing which I no more think of making a wife of than I would my Grand Mother. G Has it  been long that Poligamy has been practiced in the Church Y it has ben practiced for some 16 years have you not read the revelation given upon that subject G I have not I think it has not been published till late. Did Joseph Smith have more than one wife. Y The revelation was publishis in Aug 1852. Joseph Smith had more than one wife G How do the women receive the Doctrin Y Quite as well as the men. I do not think there is a woman in the Church that opposed it inmore than I did in my feelings How many wives have you Mr Greely. G ownly one H. C. K. How many Misses do you keep. G Not any. B Y I do not think their is a member of the Church in this  room that has had any connexion with a woman except his wife if Mr Greely can say as much, then I think you are  virtuous. (He did not answer it) G. I would like to visit  your schools while here do you have free schools do the Church pay for the schooling of all the children Y No all pay their own schooling at present. G I hear that the  Church is rich. Y The Church have some buildings here G While Journeying here it was reported that the animals of the emigrating trains belonged to the Church. Y They are not Church animals they belong to members of the Church probably. G. Were not the leaders of the Church poor you say you have no salary. you seem to be wealthy I do not see how you get your property B. Y. I gathered some property in kirtland. I earned it with my hands except half  of a pig which weighed 90 lbs which Joseph Gave me we had to leave kirtland through persecution I came to Nauvoo with nothing I there got a property through my labor and the Blessings of God. We were driven from  our property there and I had to Borrow to get here and now  my Property I suppose is worth some three hundred thou- sand dollars and you may ask any man in heaven Earth or Hell, if I have wronged him out of a dollar   ENDENTRY July 13 and if you can find such a man I will make it right I have wronged No man I have paid for what I have had as I have said I do not have as much as an ear of corn out of the tithing office ownly what I pay for I Borrowed money to help the poor when I came here and I want you to write my statement as I give it for it is true as  the Son. I financeer my affairs according to the wisdom  God has given me and I trust to him and he alone gives me my increase. there isare fears here that there will not any potatoes grow I shall look for potatoes when it is time to dig them I do so with all my business the Lord kan make me rich or poor Just as he pleases I care not a groat for all the gold and silver in the world and Jesus Christ did not. G. The leaders of the Church must have some advantage the city lots here sold for some price did it not go to the leaders of the Church. Y No all  the setlers paid for their city lots was $1.50 $1 to the  surveyor Mr Thomas Bullock the recorder. G How do you get farmes here. Y The land belongs to the United States and all the claim setlers have is possession and improvements when men take  up unsurveyed lands they pay the surveyors fees and when they buy improvements they pay for them according to there value. and what they produce all men like to  speculate more or less and men are apt to get what they can. G I calculate that I am about the ownly man who speculates who has not bought some land in the wes- tern country, or a city lot, many who have speculated in land have become poor.   You have had two or three split off's. How do you consider them. Y. The same as all apostates. G Do the Bishops make Bishops or how is it done. Y The people meet in conference and if they want a man to preside over them as a Bishop they vote for him and he is ordained a Bishop to preside over them. G Can the people reduce a Bishop to the layity Y. The people can remove a Bishop from presiding over them by  a vote and chuse the one they wish. G who is the President of the Church. Y you know that I am the President of the Church. I have my two councellors Mr Kimball and Wells here are my councellors. Then we have Twelve Apostles and Seventies and various Quorums in our organizat- ion G My neighbors religion does not trouble me any how and I see no particular harm in your religion and I am glad to learn so much from you about the rule management, and organization of your Church I now  know much more about your Church than I ever have before. How many clergy men of other sects have Joined your Church. Y not a great many and they are not often worth much when they do Join. For the clergy men Doctors and Lawyiers make about as poor Saints as any class  of men we have for they do not like to work much and the  mormons work for a living and I believe I am about the ownly man who does not work. G I think there   ENDENTRY July 13 is not many Editors come among you by the looks of the papers published here. Y No and if they should we should  be careful not to Employ them to publish for us   G I think it would be a good plan to sow the Canida thistle all over the sage plains and deserts it would renevate the  soil and make food for cattle. Y if that is your opinion pray dont tell the people of it for you could not introduce a worse plague if the people was ^to^ introduce Canida Thistles it would come Nearer to driving out the mormons from the  country than any elsthing els. they would ruin any country G O I think they would be a great Benefit and if they got into your grass and farming land you can eisily kill them by mowing and salting them. Y I think not. G I think the Army was sent here esspecially for your Benefit and the Benefit of Wardle and Russel, you are getting rich through  the army. Y The people are making money from that source they introduce money, cattle, waggons Horses and Mules.  The people buy the waggons for the Irons for $15 or $20  of the largest class, containing some 6 or 800 lbs which is quite a help to the country where Irons is scearce G. The whole country is lined with Iron. there is many  miles of chains and if I lived in the country I would pick it up and cash it. Y The Government would claim it G I would give them so many days Notice then to take  it out of the way and if they did not do it I would take it myself. There is more good timber in one of those large freight waggons than grows in this whole Territory I dont believe in your having a Famine or that there is going to be any Famine Y what do you refer to. G I  see it published in the Deseret News. Y. yes you refer to Orson Hydes Famine sermon. G We had 2 frost in the states and it was reported that evry thing was killed on  the 11th June in the North But I do not think that the frosted district was vary extensive. Y. We are improving  evry year in agricultural, pursuits and when we get all the Dr and Lawyiers to work we shall raise all you want. I dont think we shall have any Famine. I have travelled through many parts of Europe they are capable of raising much food, I think Lombardy with its irrigation is the richest  part of Europe. G. Mr Young I shall have to state in my  report that I consider your system of poligamy is reducing the female Here to the oriental state I see no chance for the female here for her to develop herself, I see no Female signs out in this city I see no chance for a woman ownly to be a first or fifteenth wife. Y A woman here has all the  chance or liberty here to develop her talent or capabilities  of doing good and filling her sphere that she has in any country But I do not want any woman to council and dictate me in the direction of my affairs if I did I should think I  ought to have been made a woman G I dont care whether a person is man or woman I think they should have the priv- lege of Developing their Talent, it is well enough for a woman to bear children But I think they ought to rule when they are capable of it. Queen Elizabeth was the greatest   ENDENTRY July 13 Ruler England Had And Catherine was one of the greatest  Sovreigns of Russia But Poligamy I think has a tendency to bury  up the talent of women H. C. K. is it worse to be a mans second wife than to be a horewhore G I dont know that it is.   Here Mr Greely closed his interigations. Took his hat Bowed to the company and retired   After Mr Greely left conversation turned upon the oppositi- on of our enemies President Young said the Lord has said he  would fight our Battles and give us the victory and he has done it  thus Far. Should the Lord say now draw the sword and fight many would cut their way through an Enemy and turn  around and fight over the spoil. this would gratify two many evil hearts and that would not do President Kimball said God holds Gov Cummings to do his will for us if He was to leg go of him he would be our bitter Enemy    ENDENTRY July 14, 1859 ~ Thursday   14th I spent the forepart of the day in the office the afternoon in  getting Hay    ENDENTRY July 15, 1859 ~ Friday   15th I spent the day in the office in the after noon I called  upon President Young and red to him my report of his inter view with Mr Greely. He was pleased with it, it met his approbation. I also red it to D. H. Wells in the Historians office FIGURE I wrote a Letter to G. A. Smith    ENDENTRY July 16, 1859 ~ Saturday   16th I spent the day hoeing sugar cane and corn I attended a meeting of the Typhographical Society at the Counceil House Mr Horace Greely was present the meeting was got up for his specil Benefit there was quite a room full of Brethren and sisters, and a Band of music. after a few tunes by the  Band and a short Prayer By Gilbert Clements we herd  a speech from Mr Horace Greely and I must say that I was entirely disappointed in the man I was asstonished  at his speech, andlanguage, and appearance. he appeared far more like a clown of the lowest grade than he did like a  man of letters, ability, and extensive influence and a  conducter of one of the most popular Journals in the Nation I was at a losts to know whether he was playing the possum or had lost his senses. He appeared to me like a man  who had accidentelly stumbled into notiriety popularity and wealth,. for neither his head, Phisiognomy, looks,  acts, or speech indicated indicated in the least a man  of knowledge, refinement talent, influence or ability  sufficient to edit a Tribune his speech was reported by G. D. Watt I did not take minutes it is true there was  some sense in what He said but the language he used and his manner of speaking nearly destroyed all interest in the sentiments advanced. He commencd in a whine- ing drawing out of his words in a vary flat manner in  a babiyish stile as though he had neither a knowledge of  language or Grammar while at the same time we must be fully aware that he is vary proficient in both for  He has Edited and conducted the Tribune the most popular and widest circulated paper in America for more than   ENDENTRY 16 thirty years. He commenced by saying Mr President Gent- lemen and Ladies I am happy to meet with you here to night esspecially to see so many females I havent seen a woman before since I have come into this ere place not that belong to this people and I dident expect to see one while I was here well I do declair I am glad to see so many women here  to night I thought I was ownly going to meet a few poor  printers. I dident expect to see any women at all But I  expect you are connected in the printing business in some  way or other. The printers talked of gitting me up a dinner well I decair I thought it was to hot to Eat dinners much I could get along without any dinner and with  but a poor Breakfast if I could ownly in the morning  take up a News paper and read what all the world had  done the day before and gess what they would do today I could get along with the loss of all the luxeries that  you are deprived of if I could have a telegraph wire  that would tell me all that was going on in all the world He confined his speech to the printing business telegraph wire and the improvements of the day told how long he had  been in the printing business the improvements that had been made in that art since He commenced He know had a steam press that could print 20000 sheets per hour and should not be satisfied untill he could put on one ton of paper in one  continues rooll onto his cilender and print 40000 sheets per hour  and fold, cut, and direct them by steam which improvement  he was sure would soon come in use He was followed by Elder O Hyde who spoke upon a variety of subjects and belie- ved in a telegraph wire which would reach from heaven to Earth so we could get revelation of God from heaven and other world. Elder John Taylor followed and spoke of many  things and of the conduct of the Judges in this Territory James MCknight  red to Mr Greely a poem from Mr. Lions welcomeing Mr Greely He flourished a candle with such velosity around Mr Greely's head that I think he left a sprink- ling of spearm upon his close Brother Dunbar sun a  song Brother Mabyan sung a song about the man that could  never get warm and at 11 oclok they adjourned to the Globe to take Ice Cream andc but I returned home and did  not attend.
