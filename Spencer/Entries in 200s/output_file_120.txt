 of the Saints. In thy land thousands of the Saints of God   have been driven from place to place county to county and   State to State and the blood of martyrs has been spilt   for the testimony of Jesus: and when thy rulers have been   petitioned for the redress of the wrongs of the Lord's people   and thy citizens they have turned a deaf ear in their crys  Therefore O America! thou art weighed in the balance   and found wanting. From this time forth perplexity  shall rest upon thee and confusion in thy government   wisdom righteousness and truth shall depart from thy   rulers and fully sit in thy Congress and thy shame shall   be known among the nations of the earth. It shall be  a vexation to understand the report of the sorrow and  woe that shall come upon thee by sword fire tempest   earthquakes and pestilence from the hands of God   until thy government is broken up and thou art destroyed   as a nation from under Heaven. From this hour   shall these things come upon thee and shall not cease   until the whole is accomplished and fulfilled upon   thy head"    Minutes  of   The First London Conference  ^held^ at the Academy 57 King's Square  Goswell Road  Feb 14th 1841.

 Thus constantly travelling for eighteen hours I arrived at  my journey's end and was joyfully welcomed by the Saints  in Burslem and on my arrival Sister Cordon put  into my hands a letter from Elders Kimball and Smith  which was interesting: also the seventh eighth and nineth  numbers of the Times and Seasons from America. These  were a feast to my soul these being the first numbers  of that paper that I had seen for several months    Sunday I walked from Biurslem to  Lane End preached to the Saints and had an interesting  time. I then walked to Hanley and preached and  communed with the Saints and then returned to  Burslem and preached to a large congregation and felt  the Spirit of the Lord with me.

President Wilford Woodruff  Clerk Dr Wm. Copeland    During this Conference meeting we also broke bread  with the Saints and confirmed four and at 1/2 past 1  o'clock in the evening ^we meet again^ and had the largest congregation   which had assembled at our preaching place. One came   forward for baptism    This was a day which we had   long desired to see for we had laboured exceedingly  hard to establish a Church in London and at   times it seemed as though we should have to give   it up but by holding on to the work of our Divine   Master and claiming the promises of God we   were now to leave an established London Conference  with a prosperous Church planted in the Metropolis   under the care of our beloved brother Lorenzo Snow 
 are fixed and unalterable. For instance, He set the sun the  moon and the stars in the heavens and gave them their laws   conditions and bounds which they cannot pass except by his   commands. They all move in perfect harmony in their sphere   and order and are as wonders lights and signs unto us    "The sea also has its bounds which it cannot   pass. God has set many signs in the earth as well as in   the heavens. For instance the oaks of the forest the fruit of   the tree, the herb of the field all bear a sign that seed hath   been planted there; for it is a decree of the Lord that every   tree fruit or herb bearing seed shall bring forth after its own   kind and cannot come forth after any other law."    Upon the same principle do I contend that   baptism is a sign ordained of God for every believer in   Christ to take upon himself in order to enter into the   Kingdom of God. "Except a man be born of water and of the   Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God' [##John 3:5##] said the   Saviour    "As it is a sign and commandment which   God hath set for man to enter into his Kingdom those   who seek to enter in by any other way will seek in vain  God will not receive them neither will the angels acknowledge  their works as accepted for they have not taken   upon themselves those ordinances and signs which   God ordained for man to receive in order to receive   celestial glory. God has decreed that all who will   not obey his voice shall not escape the damnation   of hell. And what is the damnation of hell? Why to go   and be numbered with that society who have not obeyed   His commands.    Baptism is a sign to God and to angels   and to Heaven that we do the will of the Father and there   is no other way ordained by God for man to come unto   Him and any other course is vain. It is the decree of   Heaven and ordained that man shall repent of all his sins  and be baptized for the remission of them.  Then he can   come to God in the name of Jesus Christ in faith   and obtain the promise of the Holy Ghost." 
 The day after the Conference I baptized one  and preached at Tunstell and on the next evening at Burslem  to a crowded audience and the power of God rested upon  me. Great solemnity pervaded the congregation. The   Spirit of God was moving the people and they felt that  the Lord was doing a work in their midst    October ^1st^ 2nd I walked to Hanly  and thence to Stoke where I found George A Smith  who had just returned from London. We then went to  Lane End where we found brother Kimball. After  partaking of food we went to the water and baptized  two and thence to the preaching room where we met an  overwhelming congregation. I testified to them of the  work of God and was followed by Elder Kimball. The  power of the Almighty was upon the people and they   felt that it was a day of warning and repentance. Six  were confirmed and three baptized    Next morning Elder Kimball and  myself arose from our bed with the power of God resting upon   us yea His Spirit was like fire shut up in our bones.  I said    O my God why is thy Spirit thus upon me? Why  isare thmy eyes like a fountain? What art thou about to do  O my God that causes this thing? I ask thee Father  to tell it unto me in the name of Jesus Christ thy Son  And the Spirit of revelation came upon me and I was answered    "Thus saith the Lord God unto thee my  servant Willford; This is my Spirit which resteth upon  thee to enlighten thy mind to show thee things to  come and not only upon thee but upon all my faithful  servants upon the face of the whole earth saith the Lord.  Mine indignation is about to be poured out without  mixture upon all the nations of the earth and they  shall not escape. The cry of the poor the widow  and the orphan ascendeth into mine ears saith the Lord  and I am about to avenge the cry of mine elect by  laying low the oppressor and executing the decree of  mine heart upon all the ungodly amongst men 
 Brother Kimball on the 15th received a letter   from his wife informing us that the Prophet Joseph  had written for the Twelve to come immediately home   for our personal safety and the next day we met   with the Church previous to our parting with the   London Saints    Greater excitement than ever prevailed   throughout London and especially in the House of   Parliament over the imprisonment of M. C. Cleod   and the North Eastern Boundary question and   Government secured determined on war and to every   appearence hostilities between England and America   seemed almost certain and it appeared as much   ^as^ we should do to sail from Liverpool before war   broke out    I received a letter from Elder Wm  Pitt containing 3 pounds and informing me that   there was an appointment for me to preach in   Bristol on the Sunday    Dr Copeland introduced us by   letter to the Overseer of the Library of Bartholimew   Hospital which we visited and was very politely   conducted by Dr Lyon through the various  departments of the Hospital and after visiting the   Museum Lecture Rooms and other places we last   of all visited the Dissecting Rooms where there ^were^ about   twenty human bodies which the doctors were dissecting    On the same day I corrected   the proof sheet of our Address to the citizens of London   and in the evening our sitting room was full of Saints  as we were soon to leave London and they brought us   some money and presents for our wives and children    Two days afterwards we baptized   a Jew and Jewess.    I was unwell that night and arose next   morning quite ill but walked to the printing office   and got three throusand copies of our Address to the   citizens of London for which I paid three guineas 
 "What is the sign of the healing of the sick?  The laying on of hands is the sign marked by James   and the custom of the ancient Saints as ordained by the   Lord; and we shall not obtain the blessing by pursuing   any other course than that which God hath marked   out. [##James 5:14-15##]    What if we should attempt to gobtain the Holy   Ghost through any other means except the sign or   whay which God has appointed? Should we obtain   it? Certainly not. All other means would fail. The   Lord says do so and so and I will give the blessing  There are certain key words and sign belonging to the   Priesthood which must be observed in order to obtain   the blessings    The sign of Peter was to repent and   be baptised for remission of sins with the promise   of the gift of the Holy Ghost; and in no other way is   the gift of the Holy Ghost obtained [##Acts 2:38##]    There is a difference between the   Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius  received the Holy Gost before he was baptized which   was the convincing power of God unto him of the   truth of the Gospel; but he could not receive the gift   of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. [##Acts 10:44-48##] Had   he not taken this sign, this ordinance upon himself   the Holy Spirit which convinced him of the truth of   God would have left him. Until he had obeyed the   ordinance of baptism and received the gift of the Holy   Ghost by the laying on of hands according to the order   of God he could not have healed the sick nor commanded   an evil spirit to come out of a person and be obeyed for   the spirit might say to him as to the sons of ^Seavey^   Peter I know and Paul I know and Jesus I know but who   are ye? [##Acts 19:15##]    It mattereth not whether we live long   or short after we come to a knowledge of the principles  of the Gospel and obey them. I know that all men will  be damn'd if they do not come in the way which God 
 Therefore I put my Spirit upon thee and say unto thee, Lift  up they voice and spare not and call upon all men to  repent that come within the sound of thy voice and  many souls shall be given unto thee and great shall  be they reward and eternal shall be they glory saith  the Lord"    The people were much stirred up throughout  the Potteries and felt as they never felt before. I walked to  Stoke and preached to the people and the power of God rested upon  us. Three were baptized and confirmed    On the 5th I took coach in company of Elders  Kimball and Needham for Manchester. I had a touch of the  ague on the way and had of the cholera the day before    When I aArrived in Manchester I had an  interview with brothers Young Richards Orson Pratt and many  other brethren.    Minutes  of  ^At^ The General Conference  held  At Manchester  Oct. 6th 1840    ^There were^ Present: of the Twelve Brigham Young Heber C  Kimball Willard Richards Orson Pratt George A  Smith and Willford Woodruff: also 5 High Priests 19  Elders 28 Priests 14 Teachers and 2 Deacons.    The meeting was called to order at 10 o'clock  by Brigham Young when it was moved by him and  seconded by Wilford Woodruff that Orson Pratt be President  of the Conference which was carried unanimously George  Walker chosen Clerk of the day.    After singing and prayer there was ^were^ represented 27  Conferences besides other Churches not yet organized into 
 I took the parting hand of Elder Kimball who   this day left London. But my distress and pains of   body increased throughout the day insomuch that my   friends thought that I had caught the small-pox through   administering to the daughter of brother Corner ^Morgan^    Sunday I grew worse but Dr Copeland  coming to visit me said it was not the small pox but   a severe attack of cold and fever. He prescribed for me   and I began to recover    Two days after I was better though still   weak in body and only able to trace a few lines in   my Journal with a feeble hand, and I was forced to fall   back upon Elder Snow to write for me to Elder Young    Last evening the noble spirited and   celebrated Temperance lecturer J. S. Buckingham finished   his course of lectures concerning his tour through the United   States which was delivered to a crowded audience Intreating   upon the country goverment laws customs fashions   religions sects and a variety of other matters he omitted   the Mormons or Latter-day Saints although he had   informed the public he should speak upon that   subject    This omission was in consequence of   his having the day previous to his lecture received   a letter from Dr Copeland including one of our Addresses  to the citizens of London which clearly showed him   that we were American citizens Elders of the Church   and in the city and should have a knowledge of   what he presented to the community concerning us    Early this morning Dr Copeland received   a letter from J. S. Buckingham who acknowledge his   ignorance concerning our cause and very much wished information   by obtaining our writings. So I made him a present   of the Book of Mormon the Millennial Star and other   works hoping they may ^might^ do good    I walked out as far as brother Corner's   and found myself very weak. Many friends came   to see me in the evening. 
 has appointed.    "As concerning the resurrection I will merely say   that all will come from the grave as they lie down whether old   or young there will not be added to their stature one cubit   neither taken from it all being raised by the power of God   having spirit in their bodies and not blood    "Children will be enthroned in the presence   of God and the Lamb with bodies of the same stature as they   were one earth having been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.  They will there enjoy a fulness of that light glory and intelligence   which is received in the celestial Kingdom of God.    "Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord for   they rest from their labours and their works do follow them"    Before closing the speaker called upon the   vast assembly to humble themselves before God and in  mighty faith prayer and fasting call upon his holy name   that the inhabitants of that city might escape the power   of the Destroyer that rideth upon the face of the earth and   that the Holy Ghost may rest upon them and the earth   ^be^ sanctified under their feet.    After the close of the meeting the Prophet   Joseph informed the congregation that he should attend to   the ordinance of baptism in the river near his house   at 2 o'clock and at the appointed hour the bank of the   Missisippi was lined with a multitude of people and   President Joseph Smith went forth into the river and   baptized with his own hands about 80 persons for the   remission of sins and what added joy to the occasion   was that the first person baptized was Mr. L. D Wason   a nephew of sister Emma Smith and he was the   first of her kindred who had embraced the Gospel    At the close of this interesting scene the   administrator lifted up his hands toward heaven and   implored the blessing of God to rest upon the people   and verily the Spirit of God did rest upon the multitude   to the joy and consolation of our hearts.    After baptism the congregation again   repaired to the grove near the Temple to attend to 
 Conferences. The representation stood as follows:    Conferences and Churches 41  E with members 3626; Elders 81 Priests 222  Teachers 74; Deacons 26.    This was an increase since the last Conference of the  British Mission of Members 1113; Elders 25 Priests 96  Teachers 15; Deacons 13.    After the transaction of much other business the  meeting was dismissed by prayer    President, Orson Pratt  Clerk, George Walker.    Next day October 7th I sat in council with the  Twelve and many other officers at the Millennial  Star Office and in the evening we all attended a  discussion held at the Carpenter's Hall between a Mr  T [blank space] and Elder Alfred Cordon on the one side  to prove the Book of Mormon not true and baptism  non-essential to salvation. Elder Cordon sustained the  affirmative. The discussion was before 1500 people  In lighting the chandeliers before the meeting 12 of the  glasses bursted. During the day I filled two  mamouth sheets with an account of my travels from  Montrose to the present time to send by the hand of  Elder Mulliner to E. Robinson and Don Carlos Smith  editors of the "Times and Seasons"    In Council with the Twelve next  day at the house of Willard Richards and on the following  Father Peter Melling Patriarch of the Church in England  bestowed a Patriarchal blessing upon my head and also upon  the heads of brother Willard Richards and his wife who two  days after became the mother of as fine a son as I ever  saw. He was named Heber John Richards    This was Sunday Oct 11th and we held  our usual meetings and in the evening Elder Brigham Young 
 I spent the 25 in paying my last visit   to the Saints in London and preparing for my   departure and in the evening I preached for the last   time in London before my return to Nauvoo    Next day I parted with ^from^ Elder Lorenzo  Snow and the London Saints and took train at the   Great Western Station for Bristol. I rode by rail   to Wolton Basset eighty miles and then took coach 36  miles to Bath. The road was very bad    Bath is the most striking place  to the eye of the Traveller that I ever saw. The city   extends to the summit of two high hills—Beechen   Clift and Bacon Hill and fills the valley between   The city is a very ancient antique looking place and   very picturesquely situated    I again took train at Bath to   Bristol and arriving called at No 12 Redcliff Crescent   Bedminster Parish where I found Elder Thomas   Kington and all his household and also Elder Pitt  all of whom I was glad to meet.    The city of Bristol is a noted  place and one of England's capital ^principal^ cities. Here I found   a small branch of the Church of Latter day Saints  raised up numbering thirteen souls.    On Sunday though still labouring   under a sever cold I preached for the first time in   the city of Bristol in the afternoon and evening. I   preached in the Theatre which was crowded to overflowing   with persons to hear me. There was good attention   paid and I felt that many souls would embrace the   work in Bristol    Next day was the first of   March and    My Birthday    This was the first day of Spring and I was 34   years of age. My severe cold continued to afflict me   much. I spent the day with brother Kington and   the next ^(2nd)^ was somewhat better when I again preached 
 the ordinance of confirmation; and notwithstanding that  Joseph had spoken in the open air and stood in the water  and baptized so many about 56 of those baptized  received confirmation under his hands and during the  intermission of the meetings there was probably as  many more baptized and confirmed for their dead relatives  at the font by the Twelve. H. C Kimball baptized about  40 and I assisted in confirming 20. It was truly an  interesting day    On the Sunday following a large  assembly met in the grove near the Temple when  Elder Amasa Lyman addressed the assembly and  was followed by the Prophet Joseph who proved from  the Bible the doctrine of baptism for the dead    At the close the congregation again  assembled upon the bank of the river and Joseph went  into the water and baptized all who came unto him  As I considered it my privilege to be re-baptized for  the remission of sins not having had the benefit of  the ordinance since administered to me by Elder Zerah  Pulsipher when I entered the Church I went forth into  the river and was baptized under the hands of Joseph  the Prophet. Likewise did John Taylor and many  others and Joseph called upon me to assist him and  I did so baptizing twelve. Then the Prophet lifted  up his hands to heaven and blessed the people and  the Spirit of God rested upon the congregation. And  after the multitude had gathered again to the grove  Elder Taylor and myself were confirmed ^by the laying on^ with the gift of  ^of hands^ the Holy Ghost and we then commenced to confer the  like blessing upon others confirming others.    On the next day Elder Lyman  Wight landed in Nauvoo with about one hundred and  seventy Saints mostly from England and three thousand  dollars worth of property for the benefit of the Temple  and Nauvoo House 
 preached to about 1500 persons. We commenced a letter historical and  religious to E Robinson and Don Carlos Smith    Next day Elders Young Kimball Richards George  A Smith and myself purchased a broad cloth cloak just alike. I  spent some portion of the day in reading the proof sheet of the Book   of Mormon: so also I did the day following    The work of God had progressed in the town of  Manchester the Elders had preached in the streets and the ministers  of the day especially the Methodists were full of malice and the  spirit of persecution was manifesting    I parted with Brothers Richards, Young  and Kimball and took coach to Burslem on the 14th and  on the morning arose refreshed by sleep and better in body  than I had been on the previous day.    But my mind was troubled for the Spirit  manifested much discomfort and persecution among the Saints  throughout Europe and America and that many will fall  away: also that the "Powers that be" in America will rise up  against the Church and that it will be again driven and  that while trouble lay in the future before the people of  God greater calamities awaited the world    This same spirit rested at that time upon  the Elders and Saints generally in the British Mission and  there was mourning because thereof and multitudes of  the Saints were receiving testimonies of the clouds which were  gathering over the Church and afterwards over the whole world  for judgment begins first at the House of God.    There is no doubt that the Lord was beginning  at this time to manifest what in a few years afterwards  completed the blackest written page of our history in the cruel  martardom of Joseph and his brother Hyrum the Prophet and  Patriarch of the Church and the merciless extermination  of the Saints from Nauvoo    Concerning the testimonies of calamities  to fall upon the world direful wars to be poured out upon  all nations the bloody civil war and rebellion in America  which should resemble the former history of that continent  as related in the Book of Mormon when two great divisons 
 and for the last time in the Theatre in Bristol. There   were many present and as before good attention was paid    The following day ^(3 mar)^ I took a walk with   Brother Kington through the city of Bristol; after which we   visited the suspension bridge then being errected across the river Avon at St Vincent's Rocks Clifton    This Suspension Bridge is 100 feet high   and 700 feet in length. There was a bar and two ropes   extending across from pillar to pillar and persons could   only pass over in a basket one or two at a time. This   basket goes on rollers or wheels and almost with the speed   of a steem engine. I saw several pass over in this way    At this place there were some of the greatest   curiosities in the petrified stones formed from the various   shells fish worms and other living creatures of the sea which   had been transformed into fossels of beautiful figures and   colours. I purchassed some small specimens and after  walking over and viewing the sea we returned having a   look of ^on^ the Great Western—the first steem ship which   crossed the Atlantic.    After we had returned home I went   to the water and baptized a lady by the name of   Howell and confirmed her at the room where we had   a good time. I laid my hands upon many and   blessed them. I blessed Elder Kington and all his   household.    Next day ^(4th)^ I parted from the Saints  in Bristol and took coach and rode to the "passage"  over the river Severn which I crossed in a passenger   boat and again took coach to the town of Cheapstow  Monmouthshire Wales. I arrived here at 11 o'clock &   spent three hours in this noted town. I visited the   old famous Cheapstow Castle in which it is said that   Oliver Cromwell was imprisoned for a season. This   castle is very antique and partly in ruins and there   are many of the same kind in Wales built for   defence against the English but it is evident from   their construction situation and location that they were 
 Minutes  of the  General Conference of the Church in Nauvoo  April 6, 1842    The day was rainy and the Conference did not  meet until 1 o'clock p.m. President Hyrum Smith occupied  the time mostly through the remainder of this day giving  instruction    The following morning was also rainy  and the Conference did not re-assemble until 1 o'clock in  the afternoon.    A variety of subjects was presented to the  congregation by the First Presidency and the Twelve, and  those who desired to be ordained to the office of Elder  were called upon to come forward and give in their names  Many obeyed the call.    The sun arose pleasantly on the next  day and Conference continued at 10 o'clock in the morning  Elder Lyman Wight Presidents Joseph Smith & Hyrum  and others spoke.    Then those who were to be ordained  Elders were requested to withdraw by themselves from  the congregation and they did so and six of the Twelve  namely Brigham Young Heber C Kimball Orson Pratt  Lyman Wight Willard Richards George A. Smith and  myself went forward and ordained two hundred and   seventy five to the office of Elders.    This was truly an interesting time. More  Elders were ordained on this day than were ever before in  the Church of Latter-day Saints ordained in one day.    While this was going on Elder Taylor was ^from^  ^the stand^ delivering a discourse to the multitude and there were  others baptizing and confirming at the same time at  the font and elsewhere. 
 of one original people like the North and South about anhialate  each other such had been the prophesies and testimonies  of the Elders and Saints from the beginning    Soon indeed were the forebodings of the  Spirit concerning the dark and tempesteous clouds looming  in the future fulfilled in the rapid development of  events monumentous to the church and the whole world  First came the troubles of the Saints at Nauvoo ending  with the dark and bloody page in our history of assassin  and extermination of the Saints from the civilized world  Quickly followed the rising of all Europe in revolution and  from that to the awful struggle between the North and  South such a rapid succession of great startling & dire  events enough to fill in the history of half a dozen   centuries.    I left the Staffordshire Potteries on  the 16th with Bro Cordon and preached in Birmingham  that night which was the first time I ever preached  in that great town. At this time there were four  Saints in Birmingham and several others ready for   baptism. I felt that there would be a great work  done in that town.    Next day I took the rail at  Birmingham at 10 o'clock a.m. and arrived in London  at 3 o'clock p.m. At the station I took the omnibus  to brother Corner's where I found Elder George A Smith  We were glad to meet with each other once more.    We hired lodgings—board and sitting  room at No 40 Ironmonger Row St Luke's. Everything  was dear and we found that with the greatest economy  we could not do with much less than a pound per week  for each.    What few Saints there were in London  at that time were very poor and not able to assist  us but we hoped the Lord would soon open the way  in that great Babylon of the nation that His work  might roll forth. It was however certainly the darkest  prospect before us of any place I had ever been in since

Much of the route was by the   windings of the River Y [blank]. The coachman ran his   horeses down the mountains which would have   endangered our lives had not the roads been good    When I arrived at Monmouth Elder   James Morgan was waiting my coming and had given   out an appointment for me to preach in the town at 7 o'clock  at the house of Robert Davis. There was a crowded   meeting and many could not get into the house. Four offered   themselves for baptism. The Spirit witnessed to me   that there would many embrace the Gospel in Monmouthshire  and I said, "The harvest is great and the labourers   few.    I arose in the morning ^5th^ refreshed   by sleep and having taken breakfast with Mr Maston  I walked ten miles throug^h^ mud and water in a driving   March rain storm to sister Mary Morgan at little  Garway where I found a pleasant family of the Saints.  We were drenched with rain but found a good fire &   spent the day comfortably and in the evening I had an   interesting itnerview with Elder Littlewood    The next day ^6th^ at Sister Morgan's   reading the History of Rome with much interest and   and in the evening I met the officers of the   Church there in council and had a good time    Sunday ^7th^ I preached in the morning   at the house of Bro Thomas Rook and in the evening   at the Kitchen upon the Book of Mormon and had the   place full    The   Garway Conference  ^held^ March 8th 1841 
 In the afternoon Elders Amasa Lyman and Wm.  Smith occupied the stand and waere followed by Joseph with  a few remarks and the Conference closed.    On the following day the Saints in  Nauvoo assembled at the house of President Marks to  pay their last respects to the remains of Ephraim his  son    A large procession formed two by two  and walked to the grove where a great concourse of the  citizens haassembled    The Prophet Joseph spoke upon the  occassion with much feeling. Among his remarks  he said:    "It is a very solemn and awful time.  I never felt more solemn. It calls to my mind the  death of my oldest brother who died in New York and   of my youngest brother Carlos who died in Nauvoo  It has been hard for me to live on earth and see  those young men upon whom we have leaned as  support and comfort taken from us in the glory  of their youth. I have sometimes felt that I should  have been more reconciled to have been called myself if  God had so willed it. Yet I know we ought to be still  and know that it is of Him and be reconciled    "All is right. It will be but a short  time before we shall all in like manner be called. It  may be the case with me as well as with you. Some  have supposed that brother Joseph could not die but this  is a mistake. It is true there have been times  when I have had the promise of my life to accomplish  such and such things; but having accomplished those  things I have not at present any lease of my life and  am as liable to die as other men"    The Prophet made many other remarks  of a similar kind and President Sidney Rigdon closed  The body was then conveyed to the grave in solumn  silence and each as they passed by droped a branch  of evergreen into the grave 
 I had entered the vineyard. But the Lord was with us and  we were not discouraged.    Sunday we met with the Saints at Bro  Corner's three times read in the Book of Mormon gave instruction and  broke bread unto them. We had a good time though there was  only about half a dozen present. I felt the Spirit bear testimony  that there would be a work done in London    I fell asleep having retired to rest in good  season and slept until 12 o'clock (midnight) when I awoke and   meditated upon the things of God until 3 o'clock in the morning  and while forming a determi[n]ation to warn the people in London  and overcome the power of darkness by the assistance of God  a person appeared unto me whom I consider was the Prince  of Darkness. He made war with me and attempted to  take my life. He caught me by the throat and nearly  choaked me to death. He wounded me in my forehead  and I also wounded him in a number of places in the head  As he was about to overcome me I prayed to the Father  in the name of Jesus Christ for help. I then had power  over him and he left me though much wounded. Afterward,  a ^three^ persons dressed in white came to me and prayed with  me and I was immediately healed of all my wounds and  delivered of all my troubles.    Next day George A Smith and  myself spent several interesting hours in visiting the   British Museum. In company with the rest of  my brethren of the Twelve who attended the General Conference  of July I had visited the Manchester Museum and   to-day I had a greater treat in spending a few hours  in one of the most worthy places in the world for a  traveller's note. The following is my synopsis of the history  and our inspection of the    British Museum    The British Museum originated with the  will of Sir Hans Sloane who besides a large library  of books and manuscripts had accumulated the 
 I met the Garway Conference at the ^Kitchen.^   Elder Levi Richards was chosen President and Elder James Morgan  Clerk.    There were present one of the quorum of the   Twelve one High Priest seven Elders eleven Priests two   Teachers and one Deacon    The meeting opened by prayer by Elder Woodruff   after which the churches were represented as follows:                 members Elders Prst: Teachs   Deacs      Garway 1304 3 1 2 1      Arcop   12 0 2 1 0      Ewis Harrald   8 0 1 0 0      Longtown   10 1 1 0 0      Total 134 4 5 3 1       After the representation it was motioned that   John Needham be ordained Elder William Morris Priest   and Thomas Rough Teacher    These were ordained under the hands   of Elders Woodruff and Richards.    The meeting adjourned till 3 o'clock and   one was baptized.    In the afternoon Elder Levi Richards   spoke and I followed him. After meeting the Saints   contributed one pound to help me and I sold them 3   Books of Mormon and fifty Addresses to the citizens   of London. I then walked 5 miles with brother   Richards to brother Holleys and spent the night. This   was the first time I had seen Brother Levi for   about two years    Next day in company of Elders Levi   Richards and Thomas Pitt I walked to the city of Hereford   where Elders Kay and others had been preaching. and  the people were much stirred up    On Sunday a preacher arose before   two or three thousand in the Market House and   informed the multitude that he had a fresh letter   direct from America showing the origin of the 
 On Sunday a large congregation met at the grove  William Law addressed the assembly for about an hour    Then Joseph the Seer arose in the power  of God and reproved and rebuked wickedness before the  people in the name of the Lord. "I wish to say a few  words to suit the condition of the general mass and I shall  speak with the authority of the Priesthood in the name of the  Lord God which shall prove a savior of life unto life or of  death unto death    "Notwithstanding this congregation profess   to be Saints yet I stand in the midst of all characters and all  classes of men    "If you wish to go where God is you must  be like Him or possess the principles which he possesses  for if we are not drawing towards God in principle we  are going from Him and drawing towards the Devil    "Search your hearts and see if you   are like God. I have searched mine and feel to repent   of my ^all^ sins    "We have thieves among us, adulterers  liars hypocrites. If God should speak from heaven  He would command you not to steal nor to commit  adultery nor to covet not deceive but to be faithful over  a few things    "As far as we degenerate from God we  descend to the Devil and lose our knowledge and without  knowledge we cannot be saved    "While our hearts are filled with evil  and we are studying evil there is no room in them for  good or for the studying of good    "Is not God good? Then be you good.  If He is faithful, then be you faithful. And to your  faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and seek for every  good thing. The Church must be cleansed and I proclaim  against all iniquity    "A man is saved no faster than  he gets knowledge; for if he does not get knowledge  he will be brought into captivity by some evil power 
 largest collections of natural History and works of art  of any of his time. These he directed should be  offered after his death to the British Parliament. He  died in 1753 and the offer was accepted and the act  of 26 George II which directed the purchase of the collection  of Sir Hans Sloane also directed the purchase of  the Harleian Library of Manuscripts and enacted  that the Cottonian Library which had been given  to the Government in the reign of William III should  with these form one general collection. In the  spring following the death of Sir Hans Montague   House was purchased as a repository for the whole  and it was determined that the new institution  should bear the name of    The British Museum.    Till the arrival of the Egyptian Antiquities from  Alexandra in 1801 Montague House was sufficient  for the reception of its acquisitions. Most of the  Egyptian monuments were too massive for a private  dwelling and this first suggested the necessity of  an additional building which was rendered still more  indispensible by the purchase of the Townley Marbles  in 1805. A gallery adequite for the reception of  both was completed in 1807 and in 1823 upon the  donation of George the IV of the Library of George III  Government ordered the errection of the present building  known as The British Museum of which the old  building Montague House forms the general front    From time to time the original  has been added unto until the British Museum when  we visited it covered five acres of ground    Though I felt interested in viewing  every appartment of this famous Museum which  contains the greatest collection in the world yet I felt  more deeply interested in that part called the Gallery  of antiquities especially the Egyptian department The  antiquities consisted mostly of the Greek Roman Jewish  Egyptian and some British 
 Book of Mormon. So he read the old Spalding story    When he got through Elder Levi Richards  arose and informed the people that instead of its being a   new story it had been published for two ^seven^ years throughout   the United States and also throughout ^in^ England. This caussed   a great uproar for while some were for driving the   man out of the place for lying others were crowding  around Elder Richards and Kay to hear them preach  The crowd however was so exited that they left the   ground with hundreds following them.    There never was a time when the   people were so much stirred up and eager to hear the   Latter-day Saints than ^as^ at the present and it was   expected that we should not get through the city without   having crowds around us. We did however and had   a view of Hereford Cathedral as we passed along and   reached Sister Buftons    There was at this time a small   Branch of the Church at Hereford numbering seven   members.    We parted wifrom Brother Pitt at Hereford   and continued to Lugwardine where I met with the   Church for the last time and preached from the   ##Isaiah 24|24 ch of Isaiah##.    On the morrow I walked to   Shucknell Hill and had an interesting meeting with the   Saints and preached upon the gathering to Zion and   Jerusalem. It was my last meeting with them   and I bid them farewell    Next day I walked to Standley   Hill and dined with Brother Oa^c^key whom I was   truly glad to see once more. We went together through   Standly Hill and called upon the Saints    It was Six months had passed   since I had parted from the churches in this region   but now I was again in the field where the Lord   by his blessing and the power of the Holy Ghost had   made my labours so abundantly fruitful. I had 
 in the other world. Evil spirits have more knowledge and  consequently more power than many men on earth. Hence  it needs revelation to assist us and give us knowledge  of the things of God    What is reason that the Priests  of the day do not get revelation? They ask only to   consume it upon their lusts. Their hearts are corrupt and  they cloke their iniquity by saying there is no more  revelations. Yet if any revelations are given of God  they are universally opposed by the Priests and  Christendom at large for it reveals their wickedness  and abominations."    Many other remarks were also  made by Joseph.    The Nauvoo Legion    The Nauvoo Legion met on Parade on the  7th of May. The whole Legion was mustered and  it consisted of 23 companies. The Legion that day  on parade numbering not much less than 2 thousand  men and officers mostly all ^in^ well dressed uniform truly  made a splendid appearance. General Joseph Smith  had provided a sumptious dinner for the whole staff  with their ladies    A steam boat landed at noon,   under the salute of the martial band, and landed  about forty Saints mostly from Herefordshire England    The second Sunday following  I attended meeting at the Grove and in the afternoon  preached. This was the first time I had spoken  to the Church at head quarters for two years    At the close of the meeting with brother  Charles C. Rich I went to the font and ^we^ baptized  ^I was also baptized for^ about one hundred persons mostly for the dead.    At this time I was baptized   for my great grandfather Josiah Woodruff and  my great grandmother his wife. This was 
 The Portland Vase is perhaps the choicest of the antiquities  being the only article of the kind known in the world. It was found  two miles and half from Rome in the middle of the sixteenth century  and for more than two hundred years it formed the principal  ornament of the Barberini Palace. The material of which the  vase is made is glass. The figures which are executed in relief are  of a beautiful opake white and the ground of a dark transparent  blue. This superb specimen of Greek art was deposited in the  British Museum in 1810 by the Duke of Portland    Among the Egyptian antiquities are a large  number of toombs coffins mummies hiyeroglyphics & papyri enough  if translated into the English language to make a hundred vols.  as large as the Bible. In this part I felt more interested  then in any thing I saw as they were from three to four  thousand years old and would no doubt if translated have  revealed many most valuable and glorious things historical  and sacred concerning the early ages of the world and of Abraham  Joseph Moses and Israel in Egypt and then what a world  of information they doubtless contained of their mysteries their  science and traditions of the origin of man the biographies  of Adam Noah and the first Patriarchs of our race and  of the institutions of religion recorded by the profound and   learned priesthood of Egypt.    Having formed an intimate   acquaintance with one of the Overseers of the gallery of  Antiquities he explained many things to us concerning  what we saw which were very interesting    We saw the toomb said to be  that of Alexander the Great and among many thousand  other things was Napoleon's snuff box which cost  three hundred guineas a piece of the Tower of Babel  many lamps from Babylon relics from the ruins  of Herculaneum & Pompei and a bronze statue of  Nero when he was young with antiquities and inscriptions  from Athens and an endless variety of articles from  all the ancient cities of Greece Rome Egypt and  Jerusalem. Many of the ancient relics do not differ  much in shape from corresponding things of modern days 
 on the 15th day of May and on the 21st of the previous  month I was also baptized for my mother and two brothers  This made five for whom I had been now baptized.    On the Sunday following which was the  29th of May I baptized in the font Elder George A Smith  for the restoration of his health. At the same time I was  baptized by him in behalf of my grandfather Eldad Woodruff  and grandmother Dinah Woodruff; and I also baptized my  wife Phebe for her Grandfather Joshua Fabyan and grandmother  Sarah Fabyan and her great-uncle John Fabyan. At the  same date that I was proxy for my mother and two  brothers my wife was ^also^ for her uncle John and Sally  Fabyan and her uncles George and Joseph Fabyan.    May the 30th I was baptized under the  hands of George A Smith for my Great grandfather and  Great grandmother Thompson and for my grandfather Lot  Thompson and his wife Anna my grandmother. At this   time I baptized my wife for her uncle John Fabyan and  aunt Sally Fabyan and her uncle George Fabyan and   uncle Joseph Fabyan. I also baptized Brother John   Benbow for six of his dead kindred and his wife for  six of her dead friends.    On the 14th of the following month—  June, I sat in council with the Twelve and we decided that  Elder Hiram Clark should go to Liverpool and take the  place of Elder Fielding who was to return with his family  to Nauvoo    Four days afterwards the citizens of   Nauvoo both male and female to the number of many  thousands assembled in Mass Meeting at the Grove  near the Temple.    Joseph the Seer arose and spoke in  great plainness concerning the corruption and wickedness of  Gen. John Cook Bennet. He also prophesied that if  the merchants of the city and the rich did not open their  hearts and contribute to the poor they would be cursed by  the hand of God and cut off from the land of the living 
 Two days after we took an interesting tour called  upon several persons had a view of the Palaces of St James  and stroled into Hyde Park visited the Lowther Bazaar the  only subterran^i^en exhibition in London. We returned home  and held a prayer meeting at brother Corner's    Next day we hired Mr. J. Barrett's Academy  King's Square Goswell Street for three months to preach  in and I went to the printer and got 500 hand bills printed  to publish our place of worship and on my return Elder  Smith presented me with three letters to read and No 10 of   the Times and Seasons. The letter from Father John  Smith to his son George A. informed me of the death of  my daughter.    In the evening of the same day  in company of Elder George A Smith I attended a   Missionary meeting of the Wesleyan Methodist connection  in their chapel City Road. It was considered one of the greatest  Missionary meetings ever held in the city of London and  the chair was filled by the Lord Mayor. He was  a noble looking man and the insigna of office which  hung about his neck consisted of six gold chains which  were large and heavy    The object of the meeting was for  the Wesleyan Methodist to send out foreign missionaries  and to make collections enough to clear themselves of  a debt of £50,000. The best talents of Europe were  gathered together on this occassion. Ministers of the  Church of England and of Scotland were present besides  numerous ministers of the Methodist connection  There was much policy manifested in this combination  of the ministers of the different churches and their  influence for the purpose of raising means.    I heard speeches from 10 to 12 ministers  One from the Scotch church as he arose and addressed  the chairman and meeting said    "My Lord and Wesleyan friends, let  my tongue cleave to my mouth and my right hand  forget its cunning when I will not take a Wesleyan by 
 It was moved by Elder Levi Richards and seconded  by Elder Horlick that Wilford Woodruff be the President   of the meeting and John Hill clerk. This was carried   unanimously and singing and prayer and The following   churches were then represented                 Mem. Eld. Prst.

In the afternoon Conference re-assembled   and the meeting opened with the usual form after   which it was moved and carried that Henry Webb be   ordained a Priest. He was ordained by Elders Levi   Richards and Willford Woodruff who afterwards gave   much instruction and counsel. This concluded the   Conference ^after^ by singing and prayer    President, Willford Woodruff  Clerk John Hill 
 The main portion of the day was taken up with  the business of the "Agricultral and Manufacturing Society"  which was established under the charter granted by the Legislature  with a view of helping the poor    Joseph also commanded the Twelve  to organize the Church more according to the law of God:  that is to require of those who come in to be settled according  to their council and also to appoint a committee to wait  upon those who arrive make them welcome and counsel  them what to do. Brigham Young Heber C Kimball  George A Smith and Hyrum Smith formed the   committee to settle the emigrants.    The Nauvoo Masonic Lodge    assembled at the Celebration of St. John on the 24th  ^of June^ at 9 o'clock in the morning at the store of Joseph  Smith where the visiting brethren were received. The   procession was formed and marched to the Stand in the  Grove near the Temple. There were present about  six thousand persons. Sidney Rigdon delivered an   appropriate address and we then returned to the Lodge  where we dispersed for refreshment and re-met at  2 o'clock in Lodge capacity    Sunday the 3rd of July about  six thousand persons assembled and was addressed  by Joseph the Seer from the ##Daniel 7|7th Ch. of Daniel## concerning  the Kingdom of God to be set up in the last days.    On the 4th of July the Nauvoo  Legion met and celebrated the day    I preached in the afternoon of Sunday  the 187th and at the close of the meeting I went to the  font and confirmed about one hundred most of whom  were baptized for the dead    The time had come when there   was again excitement throughout the land against  the Saints. This excitement had arisen partly because  the citizens of Nauvoo were disposed to exercise the 
 the hand and call him brother!"    A minister of the Church of England said    "My Lord and Wesleyan friends I wish you while looking  at the Church of England to cover her imperfections with the   cloak of charity" . . . "I would readily cover the imperfections  of the Wesleyan society but I know not where they are. I   would not hesitate to cover the imperfections of the Church  of Rome were it in my power but they are all scarlet"    A Wesleyan minister then arose and said    "We are highly favoured on this occassion by having  "for our chairman the Lord Mayor of London the chief  "Magestrate of the most renowned city in the world  "and his Lordship has like Caesar submitted himself to  "the worship and acknowledgement of Christ in this condescention  "But when rightly considered is not my Lord as highly honoured  in presiding over this vast body of respectable citizens this  evening who have met together on so important an occassion  as he would be to reign upon a throne for the angels in  heaven honour every effort that is made on earth for the  spread of the Gospel and the saving of the souls of men  My Lord and Christian friends How did the ancient  Apostles prevail? They were illiterate and had neither  money nor influence and their doctrines were unpopular  yet they established the Gospel maintained the doctrine of  Christ and caused the nations to tremble; but this was  all by the power of God and not of man. My Lord  our circumstances are different from theirs. We have  influence and wealth we have splendid chapels and respectable  bodies and our numbers are many yet if God is not with  us we cannot prevail." (I shouted Amen)    Thus speech after speech was made until  10 o'clock when a collection was made after which the  Lord Mayor arose and addressed about 3000 persons  in the city Road Chapel which was the first chapel ever  built by the immortal John Wesley. The Lord Mayor  said    "It is with pleasure that I have been permitted  to preside over this respectable body this evening on so 
 We had a very interesting time at the Conference   and a large assembly of the Saints. It was the last ^time^ that   I should attend in that part of my old and beloved field of labour   during my present mission to England and whither or not   I should ever meet here a conference assembly of Saints   again was one of the secrets of my future left to time to   reveal.    We had held our meeting without disturbance  from the mob who were present for they were kept quiet   by the Police in attendance, who were in disguise, but  after the closing of the conference meeting a scene followed   not easily described in which the Saints and myself were  the actors.    I had escaped the mobbing of the   wicked but now if I may so describe it I was fairly   mobbed by the brethren and sisters    No sooner had the meeting closed than   multitudes of the Saints crowded around me and hands   were presented me on every side to bid me farewell  Many called for me to bless them before I departed. others   cried out "Lay hands upon me and heal me before you   go." One came with, "Brother Woodruff I am turned out of   doors for my religion. What shall I do?" Another with   "I am ready to go to Zion but my wife wont go with   me. Shall I leave her to gather with the Saints?"  A wife in turn says "My husband beats me and turns   me out of doors because I have been baptized. I have   money enough to carry me and the children to Zion   will you let me go without him?" "Brother Woodruff  my mother is over 80 years of age and has willed me   60 pounds at her death but will not emigrate with me   Must I stay for her to die or leave her now to go   with the Saints?" One said, "I have sold my little   place and shall have 30 pounds to-morrow but must go   out into the street. I have not enough to carry my family   to America. Can you help me to a few pounds or tell   me what to do? And an Elder cried out "How much   longer must I preach in England before you will let me 
 rights which the Constitution of the United States guaranteed  to them in common with all other citizens—namely in  attending the elections and voting for whom they pleased  It was also partly in consequence of John C. Bennet who had  been cut off the Church for his wick^ed^ness and corrupt deeds  and had gone forth into the regions around stiring up strife  against the Church by lying against Joseph and others.    At this date the office of the Times and  Seasons needed a new stock of paper and other materials  for printing and binding which could not be purchased nearer  than St Louis and Joseph appointed me to go to that  city to purchase the new supply    So on the 23rd of July I went up to  the Steamboat landing to watch for a boat and tarried  near by for four days at brother Lyman Wights when  myself and Messrs Ashton and Moulton took passage on  board the Galena    We found the boat heavily loaded with led  and the water being low we soon saw that we should   have a slow journey.    The boat crossed to Montrose and  unloaded into lighters and the hands had a tremendious  fight while doing so.    Next day we sailed to Nashville and  over the rapids to Keokurk and ran upon the rocks  many times    Next morning we left Keokurk in rainy  weather and after we had passed Tully the boat ran upon  a sand bank and lay till next morning when we got  off and after passing Marion City the boat ran upon  another Sand bank which hindered her course for  six hours    I took a severe cold which settled into  the Bilious Fever and was exceedingly ill the remainder of the  journey.    We arrived in St Louis on the 2nd of  A^u^gust. I had suffered severely and my face was frightfully  spotted by Musketoes 
 important an occassion the memory of which will be indelibly  fixed upon my mind as one of the most pleasing events  of my life and I trust I shall ever be as ready to perform  every duty required of me by the citizens of London  as I have been to meet with our Wesleyan friends this  evening." The house rang with applause.    But in the midst of all this who  can imagine my feelings? None only those in like  circumstances to myself. Here was I with a mission  and a message from the Lord to the inhabitants of  London and stood in their midst ready to deliver  it as soon as He should open the way yet I  was as little known to them as was Jonah to  the citizens of Ninevah while in the whale's belly  Notwithstanding this great display of talant power  and policy to send missionaries to the heathen  they as much needed an humble messenger of  God to teach them the Gospel of Jesus Christ in  its primative character as Ninevah did a Prophet  to cry repentance unto its inhabitants. I retired home  alone reflecting upon these things.    Two days afterwards we circulated  and posted our hand bills which contained the following    copy of the First placard of the Church in London    "He that judgeth a matter before he heareth is not wise"    The Latter-Day Saints meet for public  worship at Mr J. Barretts Academy 57 King's  Square Goswell Road—(entrance door in President St)  every Sabbath at 3 and half past 6 o'clock p.m.: also  on Tuesday and Thursday Evenings each week at Eight  o'clock    Lectures    will be delivered by Elders Woodruff and Smith  (late from America)  who respectfully invite the citizens of London to attend.

 go to America" "Brother Woodruff wont you come and preach   in Cheltenham?" "My head is in great pain Wont you heal  me?" "I want you to consecrate these bottles of oil before   you go" "Will you write to me?" "I have been waiting   a long while to get a chance to speak to you". "Good   by" "Remember me to Mrs Woodruff!" "Good by! God   bless you!"    Thus was I for more than an hour   after the close of the meeting assailled with the affectionate   outbursts and adieus and a host of perplexities of these   Saints who crowded around me as children to their   father. for as such in Christ they were.    Many of the Saints parted from me   in tears and many followed me to Turkey Hall where I   spent the night and they filled the house until a late   hour beging counsel and instruction of me. One   of these was a Baptist Minister who had just been   baptized into the church.    On the morrow in company of   Elder Needham I walked to Keysend Street where   I preached to a crowded congregation of Saints and   on the following day I walked to Wind Point    On the way I went into the   Giants cave on Malvern Hill. It was dug out of   solid rock and its dimensions are six feet by four   at the mouth 12 feet in length and seven feet in   length. The stone that covered the mouth had   rolled down the Hill.    After viewing the Giants Cave I  ^where I^ visited the Saints at Wind's Point and thence   continued to Colwall, and ^where I^ met a large congregation   of the Saints and preached to them upon the   Gathering, which everywhere now formed the burden of   my soul to the churches I were bidding farewell.   Two of those present Elders James and Henry Jones were   like Paul had been great persecutors but were now   preaching what they had once persecuted    I received a letter from Elder Snow 
 We arrived at 12 o clock aA.mM. and stoped at  the American House.    I had only 24 hours to do my  business in and after dinner notwithstanding the   fever was raging upon me I commenced and bought  my stock of paper and walked till ten o'clock at  night and went to bed very weary sick and in severe  pain and did not sleep until 2 o'clock    I was awoke with the bleeding of  the nose. I lost a pint of blood and felt very weak  yet I commenced business before breakfast and got  my goods on board by 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  I took dinner and went to bed tired and sick indeed    The boat started at 6 o'clock in  the evening and we arrived at Keokurk having had  over two days and nights of suffering. I had bled  at the nose considerable and had the canker which  I killed with tobaco.    I left the boat and took stage  and arrived at Montrose at the time of a Masonic  procession and the institution of a Lodge in that  place    I had an interview there with Joseph  and then crossed to Nauvoo and arrived home thoroughly  pickled with the billious fever    Yet notwithstanding my state I  could not stop to rest for I found that the printing  office had stood still ten days for want of paper    The boat was five days getting  over the Rapids during which time I went down  the river six miles with a skiff and got from  the steam boat what paper we needed for present use  We were until midnight rowing over the Rapids and  in addition to my fever I caught a severe cold    As soon as the boat had landed  our freight at Nauvoo and I had seen it distributed  to its several departments I went home and took to  my bed and passed through the severest fit of sickness 
 The Gathering of Israel The Second Coming of the Saviour  and "The Restitution of All Things" spoken of by all the  Holy Prophets will be among the subjects illustrated    The Latter-Day Saints Millennial Star  published monthly: and other publications can be had at 52  Iron Monger Row St Luke's   (City press, Long Lane Dondney & Scryngour)    The following Sunday we preached for the first  time in Barretts Academy at 3 o'clock. There were present about  fifty persons unto whom I preached and Elder Smith preached  in the evening; but it was the hardest matter to awaken  an interest in the subjects that I had ever found.    Next day I received a package of seven letters  one from John Taylor from the Isle of Man to H C. Kimball  one from Father John Smith one from Elias Smith one from   Orson Pratt besides the several others and one from my wife    Extract of the Letter from my Wife  Phebe.    July 18th 1840    My Dear Willford,    What will be your feelings when I   say that yesterday I was called to witness the departure  of our little Sarah Emma from this world. Yes she  is gone! The relentless hand of Death has snatched her  from my embrace. But ha! she was too lovely too  kind too affectionate to live in this wicked world    When looking upon her I have often thought  how I should feel to part with her. I thought I could not  live without her especially in the absence of my companion  But she has gone! The Lord hath taken her home to  himself for some wise purpose. It is a trial to me  but the Lord hath stood by me in a wonderful manner  I can see and feel; and that he has taken her home and  will take better care of her than I possibly could for a  little while until I shall go and meet her. 
 who informed me that the work of God was rolling on in   London and that he had baptized seven the Sunday previous   I also received a letter from Elders Young and ^W.^ Richards.    Next day I had an interview with Elder   Levi Richards and then with him ^I^ walked over Malvern  Hill and called upon Elder Samuel Jones; Thence through   Great Malvern to Crowcat and held a meeting at brother   George Brooks' and had an interesting time with a large   number of Saints whom I had baptized about a year before    To Dunsclose the day after visiting   many of the Saints by the way laying hands upon the   sick and blessing and counselling others of the flock. They   all were happy to see me for I had baptized most of   them when I first opened that field of labour. ^Next day^    I preached at Dunsclose at the house   of Edward Jinkins to a crowded meeting but a wicked   rabble disturbed us much and I was constrained sharply   to reprove them in the power of God    A very rainy day was the 20th   but accompanied with a guide I journeyed to Rough Leaser  and thence to Ridgeway ^Cross^. Here I found Elder Thomas Clark  at his stone quary. I took several specimens of curious   petrified stone formed by the water. We then walked   to Frooms' Hill and visited the Saints by the way    Sunday followed and this was the   last Sabbath I should meet the Saints in Standly   and Froom's Hill.    At brother John Coles Frooms Hill,  I met the Saints in the ^Sunday^ morning and had a crowded   house and in the afternoon at Standly Hill where   I communed with the Church. and aAt the close of the   meeting I had a busy time shaking hands with the   Saints and parting from them many of whom wished   me to bless them and others to heal them    I spent the night with brother Levi   Richards at Elder Edward Ockey and on the morrow   we held conference. 
 I ever had in my life    I had a thorough course of bilious fever  and was brought exceedingly low and for a time struggled  between life and death. Some of the time I felt like  gathering up my feet and sleeping with my fathers    I was confined to my house and mostly  to my bed from the 10th of August to the 129th of September  making forty days.    The Twelve came and anointed me  and laid hands upon me and I felt the testimony  that I should recover but after I began to revive I had  a relapse twice    In one instance I was requested to attend  a council of the Twelve in the case of Orson Pratt. I  was very weak but yet I thought I would try to meet with  them and supposed that we should meet at Elder Taylor's  who was also very low with the bilious fever; but on our  arrival we found him so very feeble that he was not  able to have the council at his house. So we removed  to President Hyrum Smiths Office    Elder Brigham Young conveyed me  in his carriage to the place of meeting but I had not  been in the house more than ten minutes before my  strength began to fail me. I laid down upon a bench  but no sooner was I laid down than I became unconscious  and my breath stoped.    My brethren raised me up and took me  to the door and with the aid of air and water I was brought  to breath again but not without a hard struggle between  life and death.    The brethren laid hands upon me  and Hyrum Smith prayed for my recovery and I soon  began to breathe freer but my strength was entirely gone    They conveyed me home and it being  in a warm season I was much troubled for breathing  through the night. Several days elapsed before I  revived again    During my sickness there had been 
 Yes Willford we have one little angel in heaven and I think  it likely her spirit has visited you before this time    It is hard living without her and she  used to call her "poor pa, pa; and putty Papa many  times in a day. She left a kiss for her Papa with  me just before she died.    She eat her dinner just as well  as usual on Thursday was taken ill about 4 o'clock  with prestness for breath. The Elders laid hands upon  her and anointed her a number of times; but the  next day her spirit took its flight from this to another  world without a groan    To-day little Willford and I with quite   a number of friends accompanying us came over to  Commerce to pay our last respects to our little darling  in seeing he[r] decently burried. She had no relatives  to follow her to the grave or to shed a tear for  her but her Ma and little Willford    I have just been to take a pleasing  melancholy walk to Sarah's grave. She lies alone in  peace. I can say "The Lord gave and the Lord  hath taken away and blessed be the name of the  Lord. [##Job 1:21##] Phebe W. Woodruff.    On the 20th I finished a long  communication to the Editors of the Times and Seasons  signed H. C. Kimball W. Woodruff and George A.  Smith. It was commenced on the 12th. I copied it off  and it filled 4 sheets. We wrote several others to A  Cordon &c and next day heard from Parley P. Pratt  and received also a letter from Willard Richards with the  present of one pound. On the 30th I wrote a long  letter to my wife and we were often receiving and writing  communications to our brethren of the Twelve and  the Elders Saints relatives and friends both in England  and America. It may well be imagined that  the numerous letters which we received and wrote from  time were not only interesting but often important to  us and the Church and that they were as much a branch 
 Minutes  of  The Frooms Hill Conference  held at   Standly Hill Herefordshire  March 22 1841    At half past 10 o'clock Conference assembled   at the house of William Field.    There were present one of the Travelling   High Council 2 High Priests 20 Elders 30 Priests   9 Teachers and 2 Deacons    The meeting was called to order by   Elder Willford ^Woodruff^ who moved that Elder Levi Richards  should preside over the conference which the   meeting sustained and Willford Woodruff was chosen   clerk of the conference.    The assembly sung and Elder   Woodruff offered up prayer in behalf of the conference  and then the President called upon the officers for   the representation of the various branches which   was given as follows: ^see *^             -[represented by]- Mem[ber]s.

 some important events in the Church. The Lord had  manifested through the Prophet Joseph that it was his  will that the First Presidency the Twelve the High Council  the quorum of High Priests and the Elders quorum  should as a general thing go into the vineyard    The instructions were for the Elders  to confine themselves to the free States and mostly  to New England and the Canadas and not to go  into any of the Indian or Slave States    There had been a special Conference   called in consequence and about four hundred Elders  had gone into the Vineyard and many others were  going. Since the foundation of the Church there had  never been such a turn out into the ministry before  as now    Brother Taylor and myself were  the only ones of the Twelve left and we were sick  and could not go into the vineyard: moreover it  was thought wisdom for us to continue in the  printing buisness.    The Prophet had of late been much  persecuted by being hunted by Sherifs and officers  from Missouri and Illinois by the orders of Governors  Reynolds and Carlin under pretence of taking him  to Missouri to try him upon their false charge of  his being accessary to the shooting of Ex-Governor  Boggs. This was nothing but pretence and a trap  to take the Prophet upon a charge which caught the  spirit of persecution in our enemies and not because there  was any evidence in the case.    But though the Prophet Joseph had  been of late like John on the Isle of Patmos he had  presented the Church with some glorious principles and  had occassionally appeared in the midst of the Saints  but I was deprived of the privilege of being present as  I was confined with sickness    September the 19th I commenced  work for the first time for forty days and cut one 
 of our ministerial labours as preaching or baptizing, but I   cannot alwasys note the detail of our communications nor would  the bare mention give the value of the correspondence of the  Twelve one to the other and to the Elders labouring under their  direction and their communications to the representative men of  the Church in Nauvoo. Much more than can appear to  the reader who will be told in my synopsis of the year that  in 1840 I wrote 200 letters and received 112 and much more  than would appear if told the amount of correspondence of the  rest of the Twelve and Elders in the ministry labouring with  us much of our letter writing to each other in counselling   directing assisting and building each other up belong to the  history of the rise and progress of the British Mission.  Therefore in my Journal I always noted my correspondence  as a branch of my ministerial history    The dark season of the year November opened  upon us and the prospect of our mission in the city of  London was in keeping therewith. There is so much going   on in this great modern Babylon to draw the attention of  the people that it seemed almost to require the trumpets  blast from heaven to awaken the attention of the inhabitants  to our proclamation of the restoration of the fulness of  the Gospel    We were here like the Apostles of  old without purse or scrip to warn the city of London,  where we had to pay high for everything we required, and  to pay ourselves for a place to preach in. We were at  this time about out of money, but still we felt to trust  in God    November the 14 was Sunday ^Nov 1st^ and I  preached in the afternoon in the Academy to about  thirty and in the evening to about 50. We broke bread  unto the Saints and this evening there seemed to be some  interest manifested in inquiring into the work.    I received a letter from my mother-in-law  containing the news of the death of my uncle Joseph Hart  and wrote to my father in reply

 acre of corn and staked it up for my first day's work; and  the next two days I spent in drawing wood to my door.    I was forced to these exertions as it were  on the first moment of my recovery for I had been sick so long  that we had consumed our food and fuel    Elders Young and Kimball returned home  for a few days to get some printing and they were going out  again to hold conferences throughout the State. I had an  interview with them and learned that they had met in Council  with brother Joseph who thought it widom for Elder Taylor  and myself to continue at home and attend to the printing    There was at this time a prospect of  the town of Keokurk coming into the hands of the  Saints and Joseph's counsel was for me to go there  in that case and publish a political paper and Elder  Taylor to publish the Times and Seasons in Nauvoo  So I managed the affairs of my family to be ready to   do as the Lord should direct. However in the sequel I did  not go to Keokurk. In addition to my own sickness  Mrs Woodruff had a species of fellen on both her  thumbs which had caused her much pain for two or  three weeks and my little daughter had been quite ill  about the same length of time and dangerously ill   for several days    Unexpectedly the next Sunday Joseph  appeared in our midst and spoke to the Saints much  to their edification and comfort    Three Sundays later I preached  to the congregation and warned the Saints against taking ^not to take^  a course against the interest of the Church but to   take one which would help Joseph in his exile    Some time after this we had a fire  in the upper part of the printing office. A minutes  delay and we should not have saved the building    On the 30th of October for the first  time the Saints held meeting in the Temple of the  Lord in Nauvoo. A temporary floor was laid  within the unfinished walls and seats prepared for 
 On the third George A Smith and myself  again visited the Museum. I having formed an acquaintance  with the keeper of the Egyptian antiquities and it being  a private day he accompanied us through the various  appartments and spent several hours in explaining  the most important items of history of the collection  of Egyptian Jewish Greek and Roman antiquities    I had a specimen of Guy   Fawke's day in London on the 5th but the crowd  of boys with their historical effigy was not so interesting  to me as the letters which the postman brought. One  was from Samuel Jones containing good news and a  pound to assist me. The others were from my wife  and Elder Wm Clark who informed me that Phebe and  my little son Willford was at his father's house. He  said they shall not want anything which I can bestow  and may God hold it as an everlasting covenant  between thee and me. He further informed me that  the temporal affairs of the church at Headquarters was  never in a more prosperous state and that a number  of families had arrived from England and my wife  had an interview with Bro Benbow. There was no  mobing against the Saints but they were gathering rapidly  to the body of the Church in Nauvoo.    Next Sunday we preached and broke  bread with the Saints but only very few attended our  meetings and on the 9th received letters Elders  Kimball Richards O. Pratt, Curtis Kington and Johnson  Elders Kimball and Pratt both informed us of the  death of Father Joseph Smith who was the first  Patriarch of the Church of Latter-Day Saints and the  father of the Prophet Joseph.    Elder Kington spoke of the letter which  he or the Saints sent me containing £2 which was  lost. I went to the general Post Office about ^it^ and the  Post Master said he would trace it out. I mention these  letters with gifts of money sometimes for they explain  from whence came the means which first supported the 
 After the meeting was dismissed I was about   three hours shaking hands with the Saints healing the   sick and giving counsel to the multitude who surrounded   me many of whom were in tears as we parted. Nearly   fifty came to me to ask me to take them to Zion   when I had not means to take myself. I however gave   Sister Foxal five pounds to make up enough to help   her and her husband and children to the land of   America. She had raised 30 pounds by using   every exertion for six months to gather with the   Saints and the five pounds which I gave her was a   donation of Elder Edward Ockey who was imparting   of his substance to help the poor of the Church   to gather.    After biding the multitude of Saints   farewell I went to Elder Oackey's to spend the night   accompanied by Elders Richards Kington and Kay    We had been in the house but a   short time when ^3 of^ Edward Ockey's brothers came  in for the purpose of having a contest because   their brother and sister had embraced the gospel   and was about to gather with the Saints. They   manifested much wrath against me and after   conversing with them about 3 hours they left the   house and we were once more in peace    After conversing together until   the third watch of the night we retired to rest   closing one of the busiest days of my life.    I arose in the morning refreshed   by sleep and after conversing several hours with Elders   Richards Kington Kay Ockey and others of the Saints  I was under the necessity of parting with the Saints   in this region.    In biding them farewell I found   in our hearts and memory of our association many   ties which bound me to those I were leaving behind  and among the faithful ones were the Ockeys.  Brother Edward Ockey and his sister Ann were of 
 three thousand persons. The room was crowded and  the walls lined with people. Joseph had returned  to the city and was expected to preach but ill-health  and other causes prevented him.    On the same day Willard Richards  returned from the east with his family and the  next day came to my house and was taken with  the Cholera Morbeus and was low for several days    My son Willford was taken down  with the croup and for a time was dangerous    The Twelve returned home on  the 4th of November    Joseph wished Elder John   Taylor and myself to take the responsibility of  the Printing Office and liberate him from it  He offered to rent the property to us for simple interest  and we concluded to take it    The City Council spent several  days in session passing a law relative to Writ of  Habus Corpus and after it was passed Joseph  felt secure to stay at home as it protected him  as well as other citizens.    On the 7th of the following month  (December) Elder Orson Hyde returned to Nauvoo  having in his mission been in England Germany  Jerusalem and other parts of Asia    In England Elder Hyde was with  the Twelve when they in the capacity of a quorum  fully organized the British Mission; in Germany he  preached and published the Gospel in the German  language and circulated the tracts among the various  nations and in Jerusalem he visited Mount Olivet  He was the first Elder of the Latter-day Church  wthat ever visited Jerusalem.    The following Sunday Elder  Orson Hyde at President Joseph Smiths delivered  an interesting an account of his travels at Jerusalem  and home again. He spoke of the Mount Olivit 
 work in London. I wrote to Elders Kington and Browett  of my Herefordshire field and a very lengthy one to my wife's  father and mother giving an account of this country.    This was the Lord Mayor's day when  the chief Magestrate of the chief city of the world takes the oath  of office. It is a great day in London. I saw the  gorgeous procession pass.    ^In letter^ This day Elder Richards informed  me that it was the counsel of the Twelve for him ^G A Smith^ to go  immediately to the Potteries and spend some time with  the churches there as there was only about work enough  for one in London and so early next morning he   started for Birmingham and I was left again alone    The next few days I felt lonely  without my companion brother Smith for although London  is not a wilderness a Latter-day Saint Travelling Elder  at that date would be almost as solitary there.    At night on the 12th while I was  preaching Brother Wm Pitt from Dymock entered the  room I was surprised to see him for I was not  looking for any ^one^. He became a companion in the  ministry for me during the next five days    On the 16th I received a letter from  Elder Thomas Clark containing a gift of £1 and  one from Elder Browett informing me of the progress  of the work in Herefordshire and surrounding  country. I wrote to them and Elder Kington  and held several hours conversation with a  follower of Joanna Southcott and several days  after had a long interview with five of her  followers. In the meantime Elder Pitt had  left me and took a mission to Ipswich. and  I had preached several times and as usual receiving  and writing letters daily.    On the 19th I preached at the  Academy. Brother Hulme a captain of one of  the Pickford's Boats on the London canal was  present with two of his hands whom he had baptized. 
 a good and wealthy family. and They had many trials to   pass through to do the will of God and maintain their   faith and integrity  and to gather with the Saints for their   brothers were exceedingly set against them. But brother   Edward had maintained his integrity like a man of God   and was making every preparation to gather with the Saints   but his sister Ann had fears that her brothers would   hinder her gathering.    Having bid farewell to the Saints of   Standly Hill I walked to Frooms Hill and conversed with   the Elders untl 2 o'clock when I took the parting hands   of Elders Richards Kington Kay and others and with my   carpet-bag with about 20 lbs weight in it walked 15 miles   to Worcester in four hours    When I arrived there I was so very   lame and weary with my heavy load and fast walking that   I could scarcely walk at all. I then took the rail and   arrived in Birmingham at 10 o'clock at night but was   exceedingly lame and weary. I spent the night with   Elder James Riley 24 Park Street.    I had now fairly ended my Herefordshire  mission and bidden a last farewell to that field of labour   where the Lord had blessed me beyond all my expectations    I now left three conferences in the region   which I opened one year before on the 5th of the same month   that I left this vineyard planted all over with Churches  numbering fifteen hundred Saints. I have given   the minutes of those Conference not to load my book   with dry statestics which is never interesting to the   reader but to lay at once before the view if I may   so express it diagrams of the rise and progress of the   work number of Churches planted and conferences organized   in that region. If the readers will thus consider these  ^The^ minutes which I have recorded they will see in them   ^show^ at a glance a volume of history of the rise and progress  of the Churches in Herefordshire and the regions around.  For the same reason I have ^shall^ also given ^give^ the minutes   of the General Conferences that the reader may have 
 and ^he also spoke of^ the Sepulchre and many other things which reminded  him of the days of Christ    The year had rolled around and ended  with me in Nauvoo attending principally to the duties of  the Printing Office and I was tankful to the Lord for his  mercies which had brought me through the events and  scenes of 1842 and prolonged my life which Death had  threatened for future labour in His cause.

 On the following day I dined with him on board of  his boat with three Saints    The Princess Royal of England was  born on the 21st and all London rang with jubilant  bells.    The next day ^22nd^ was Sunday the  forepart of which was spent in reading and conversing  with Father Corner and his family and in the  ^In the^ afternoon and evening ^of Sunday 22^ we held public meeting  when four offered themselves for baptism but it  had been with hard labouring and much expence  that we had obtained this little success in the  establishment of the work in London    I commenced this day a long  epistle to my wife in which I sent her about  thirty extracts from letters for her to present  to the Editors of the Times and Seasons for them  to publish as they thought fit.    The Sunday following I  again preached twice and baptized and confirmed  three. These were    The First Baptized by me in London    Next day I took a very interesting walk with Dr  Wm. Copeland through every part of the college of  surgeons at Lincoln's Inn Fields and on my return   home I was soon joined by Elders Brigham Young  and Kimball who had come to spend a week   or two in London. This was the first time  ever President Brigham Young was in the metropolis  of England    We met for meeting at the  Academy Wednesday evening when brother Brigham  preached followed by brother Heber. We had a  good time    Next day we took a walk through  the city and visited and held conversation with  several one of whom was an Italian, a sculptor and

I was happy to learn   that the work of the Lord was rapidly prospering in   the Staffordshire Potteries    I received and read the 11 No of the   Millennial Star. It contained an interesting letter   from President Joseph Smith to the quorum of the   Twelve.    In Longton I baptized seven persons   one was Alexander Barton a Potter Artist and modler  and then parted with the Saints & walked to Stoke and   having dined with Elder Rowley I continued to New Castle  where there are many silk factories and I bought 15 yards 
 Jan 1843    Chap XX    On New Year's day at sunrise in company  with Mrs. Woodruff and brother Newbury and his  two sisters we started in a two horse sleigh and  crossed the Missisippi River on the ice and travelled  15 miles into Iowa Territory and joined Mr. Abraham  Newbury and Miss Eliza Duty in the bands of   matrimony. We then took dinner and returned  home making a distance for our ride of 30 miles  with the Thermometer 10 degrees below Zero.    A Jubilee  on  The Return of Joseph    We had just passed through a critical time in  the history of our people. Joseph had been presecuted  hunted and driven into the wilderness in consequence  of illegal proceedings false oaths edicts of governors and  pursuit from Sheriffs    But the^re^ being now a new Governor  Joseph had come forward and given himself up  to the authorities of the State and demanded trial  This was the very thing which he would have been  denied before had Governors Reynolds and Carlin  got possession of him and taken him to Missouri 
 modeler whose wife was the daughter of Brother Roberts ^Rogers^ and   she was an American    Visit to the Tower of London    In company of Brothers Brigham Young and Heber  C Kimball on the 3rd of December I visited the Tower  of London without seeing which the traveller would lose a   capital page from the history of his travels in England.    As usual I called at the time and entered in my  Journal a synopsis of its history &c    The Tower is situated on the east side  of the city about 800 yards from London Bridge and near  the bank of the Thames. At first it consisted of  no more than what at present is called the White Tower  It has been said though without sufficient authority that  Julius Caesar built it but there is the strongest of evidence  that William the Conquerer was its first designer and  builder. It has three batteries—The Devils Battery  the Stone Battery and the Wooden Battery all mounted  with cannon.    The Tower was a palace during five  hundred years but ceased to be so in the time of  Elizabeth and here some of the darkest tragedies of  of England's monarchs were enacted and immortalized  by Shakespear's pen. The principal buildings are  the Church the White Tower Govenor's House The Bloody  Tower the offices of ordinance of the Keepers of the  Records the Jewel Office the Horse Armoury Queen  Elizabeths armoury the grand Store House in which  is the small armoury the train of Artillery and  the Tent Room the new Store House houses for  the chief and inferior officers mess house for the  officers and barracks for the soldiers. In addition  to these there is a street called the Mint which  includes one third part of the Tower    The Grand Storehouse is north of the  White Tower. It extends in length 345 feet 
 of silk for my wife as cheep as could be bought in England    Thence to Hanley with several of the   brethren and sat in council with a number of the officers   Among other business was the case of a brother Mumford who   was practising the black art fortune telling &c but as he   persisted in his course the council withdrew fellowship from   him. One thing is worthy of notice that while the   Priesthood was upon him he could not set his magic glasses  as before but did after the office of Priest was taken from   him    I spent the night at Brother ^William^ Box who had been   sorely tempted and afflicted of the Devil for many days   We laid our hands upon him and cast the devil out and   he had peace.    On Sunday the 20th of March the    Staffordshire Conference    of the Church of Latter-day Saints met and there   were present of the Twelve George A. Smith and Willford  Woodruff with one High Priest 13 Elders 28 Priests 10 Teachers   and eight Deacons. The conference was held in the   Majestrates Assembly Room.    At the close of the Conference it was voted   that "This conference grants unto Elders Woodruff and   George A. Smith a letter of recomemendation manifesting   that the Church in this region accept of their labours   and consider that they have filled their mission with   honour and dignity"    We had a very interesting time  on this occassion. The conference was held in a place   which would hold 800 and it was crowded; but there  was perfect order and much good feeling manifested  during the day. There was a good prospect of a continued   increase in the Potteries    George A. Smith was the President   of the Conference and T. J. Fitcher and O Shaw clerks    Next day George A Smith and myself   met the officers in council at the Hanley ^Meeting^ Room and gave 
 Too well our history had told us how Joseph and his brethren  had been incarcerated in prison where they had laid in some  cases the year round inhumanly treated and their lives in  constant jeopardy and all in contempt of law and without  trial. This was the reason why Joseph wished not to  be delivered up to the tender mercy of Missouri.    But the election of a new Governor had  given the Prophet a chance of a trial and he returned and  demanded one and delivered himself to the authorities of  the State of Illionois    The demanded trial was granted  him before the Supreme Court of the United States and  he had been honourably acquitted according to the law  of the law of  ^land^ as he well knew he would be if granted  a legal trial and not committed to the lawless power  of those in authority who sought his liberty and his  life.    Joseph had now returned to Nauvoo  to have a Jubilee with the Church    The seventeenth of January was  appointed by General Proclamation for humiliation  fasting prayer and thanksgiving for the release  and delivery which we had received    Meetings were appointed throughout  the city. I met at President Joseph Smiths where  we had a very interesting time    Brother Joseph spoke for some  length on the Kingdom of God and the baptism of  John and other subjects of interest the substance of  which was aftwards delivered by the Prophet in the  Temple and which I shall presently give.    At our meeting on this General  Thankgiving day besides the address of the Prophet  many prayers and exhortations were made. I spoke twice  and felt much of the Spirit of the present    The next day Joseph and his  lady made a feast for his friends to keep the  day as a time of rejoicing for his deliverance

It was commenced  by James II and finished by William III and on the  first floor_"the Small Armoury, is the magnificent   room in which he and Queen Mary dined in great state having all  all the workmen to attend them in white gloves and aprons    The Horse Armoury    Here is arranged in chronological order twenty two  esquestrain figures of the most celebrated kings of  England accompanied by their favourite lords classed  with them mounted on their horses and in the armour  of their respected periods and many in the identical  suits of mail which they wore in life    The horses stand mounted by their riders  on a floor of brick and along the centre of the ceailing  is a gothic arch from which hasngs banners telling  the names dates and rank of the figures.

Pratt the committee appointed about a   year before to secure the copyright of the Book of   Mormon in the name of Joseph Smith presented the   following certificate:    Feb 8th 1841    Then enter for his copy the property of Joseph   Smith Junr the Book of Mormon an account written   by the hand of Mormon upon plates taken from   the plates of Nephi translated by Joseph Smith Junr  first European from the second American edition  Received five copies    George Greenhill    The above is a true copy of an entry   in the Register Book of the Company of Stationers   Rept at the Hall of the said company    Witness my hand this 17th   day of February 1841    George Greenhill  ^Wharehouse^ Keeper at the Company of Stationers    The quorum voted that they accepted   the labours of said committee    Resolved that as the quorum of the   Twelve have had nothing to do with the printing of the   Book of Mormon they will not now interfere with it   but that the said committee settle the financial or   business matters thereof with Joseph Smith Junr  to whom the profits rightly belong.    Resolved that Elder Amos Fielding be   appointed to superintend fitting-out the Saints from   Liverpool to America under the instruction of Elder   Parley P. Pratt    Resolved that brother George J.

 There were seventy five persons present including the  Twelve and the twenty who went with him to Springfield  to his trial at the United States Circuit Court    The following day was one of much  satisfaction in consequence of Orson Pratt's return to  the quorum of the Twelve    We met at Brigham Young's  and the First Presidency and the Twelve conversed  over the subject. Orson had humbled himself  for opposing Joseph and the brethren of his own  quorum and desired very much to return to his  former place    After our counselling together we  assembled at the River and Joseph went down into  the water and baptized Orson and his wife and  Widow Granger. The Prophet then confirmed  them and ordained Orson to the Apostleship and  his former standing amongst us. This caused  our hearts to rejoice    Elder Amasa Lyman who  had been appointed in his stead as a member of  the quorum of the Twelve was taken into the First  Presidency which left the place again vacant for  Orson Pratt.    I will here give a synopsis of    A Discourse by the Prophet  upon  The Kingdom of God and the  Baptism of John.    Delivered in the Temple to a large Congregation  January 22nd 1843    "Some say that the Kingdom of God was not set up  "on the earth until the Day of Penticost and that John  "did not preach the baptism of the remission of sins.

 Manchester April the 3rd 1841    This day the quorum of the Twelve met pursuant to adjournment.    The President called upon Elder Hyde to open by prayer  which was accordingly done.    The quorum then signed a letter of commendation to   the Churches in England for Elder Hyde.    The business of publishing the Star and Hymn Book   was taken into consideration. Brother John Taylor moved that   those who have had the care and superintendancy of publishing   the Star and Hymn Book should dispose of them according   to their own wishes and dispose of the procedes in the same   way: Seconded by Elder Orson Pratt and carried by a   unanimous vote.

 of God was set up on the earth from the days of Adam  When ever there has been a righteous man unto whom the  Lord has revealed his word and given power and authority  to administer in his name then has the Kingdom of  God been set up and where there is a Priest of the Most  High—a minister who has power and authority from  Him to administer in the ordinances of the Gospel  and officiate in the Priesthood there is the Kingdom  of God.    In consequence of rejecting the Gospel  of Jesus Christ and the Prophets whom God hath  sent His judgements hath rested upon people cities  and nations in various ages of the world. This was  the case with the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah which  were destroyed for rejecting the Prophets    Now I will give my testimony. I  care not for man. I speak boldly and faithfully  and with authority.    How is it with the Kingdom  of God? Where did the Kingdom of God begin?  What constitutes the Kingdom of God?    I answer where there is no Kingdom  of God there is no salvation. Where there is a Prophet   or a Priest or a righteous man unto whom the Lord gives  his oracles there is the kingdom and where the oracles  are not there the Kingdom of God is not    In these remarks I have no allusion  to the Kingdoms of the earth. We will keep the laws of  the land. We do not speak against them nor ever have  but we can scarcely make mention of the State of Missouri  and our persecutions but the cry goes forth that we  are guilty of treason &c    We speak of the Kingdom of God  on the earth and not the kingdoms of men    The plea of many is that we have  no right to receive revelations; but if we do not receive  revelation we do not have the oracles of God and they  who have not the oracles of God are not His people 
 his appearence shows a striking contrast with the rest  of the martial equestrian figures.    Leaving the examination of the Horse Armoury  we entered a small room, turning to the right. On each  side is a glass case with many curious articles beautiful  specimen of pistols carbines &c of the times of Elizabeth   James I Charles I and William III to which considerable  addition was made in 1838. In another case is a gorgeous  Mamuluke saddle Turkish bridle and horse bresast plate  with gilt furniture and theree swords and a helmet  and girdle ^which^ belonged to Tippo Saib    We next entered the long room where  we saw various figures wearing the armour of the various  periods in which they lived kings soldiers &c. One  was for a man seven feet high. At the extremity of  the room is a crusader upon his barbed horse said  to be 700 years old. Here we also saw great variety  of curious things. Passing into    Queen Elizabeth's Armoury    we found weapons of war of every variety and most of  them in use before fire arms were invented. This  room according to tradition was the prison of the  celebrated Sir Walter Raleigh. At the end of the room  is a sprightly figure of Queen Elizabeth upon a  cream coloured horse held by a page. Her dress  is in imitation of that worn by her in her procession  to St. Paul's to return thanks for the deliverance of  England from the threatened Spanish invasion. In  this room also there was a variety of instruments of  torture    We visited  The Crown Jewel Room    FirstHere was the golden wine fountain 3 feet high and of the  same circumference. 2nd The ancient Imperial crown which  was only laid aside at the crowning of George IV. It is  covered with large jewels. 3rd The golden orb six inches  in diameter edged with pearls and girded with precious 
 Minutes   of   The General Conference  of the   British Mission  at which   The Council of the Twelve met as a Quorum  for the   First ^and only^ Time in a Foreign Land    The Conference assembled in the Carpenter's Hall  Manchester on the 6th day of April 1841 and in   the 12th year of the rise of the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter-day Saints at which there was    Present Nine of the Quorum of the Twelve  namely    President Brigham Young Heber C Kimball  Orson Hyde Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt Willard Richards  Willford Woodruff John Taylor and George A. Smith.    President Young having called the house to   order and organized the Conference then opened by   prayer. Elder Thomas Ward was chosen clerk.    The President then made some introductory   remarks relative to the organization of the Church in the   House of the Lord in America concerning the different   Quorums in the^ir^ orders.    The representation of the Churches and   Conferences in the United Kingdom of Great Britain  was next called for and represented as follows in the   accompaning statistics, after which the meeting   adjourned at 12 o'clock till 2 o'clock p.m. 
 "But say you, what will become of the world  or the various professors of religion who do not beleive  in revelation and the oracles of God as continued to His  Church in all ages of the world when He has had  a people upon the earth?    "I tell you in the name of Jesus   Christ they will be damned and when you get into  the eternal world you will find it to be so. They  cannot escape the damnation of hell."    The Baptism of John    As touching the Gospel and Baptism of ^which^ John  preached I would say John came preaching the  Gospel for the remission of sins. He had his  authority from God and the ^His^ oracles of God were  with him and the Kingdom for a season seemed  to rest with John alone.    The Lord promised Zechariah  that he should have a son and Zechariah was  a descendant of Aaron. And the Lord had  promised that the Priesthood should continue with  Aaron and his seed throughout their generations    "'Let no man take this honour  upon himself except he be called of God as was  Aaron' and Aaron received his call by revelation"    An angel of God also appeared unto  Zachariah while in the Temple and said that   he should have a son whose name should be  John and be should be gifted with the Holy Ghost" [##Luke 1:13-15##]    Zachariah was a Priest of the Lord  and officiated in the Temple and John was a Priest  after the order of his father and held the Keys of  the Aaronic Priesthood and was called of God to  preach the Gospel of His ^and the^ Kingdom ^of God^. The  Jews as a nation having departed from the   Laws ^of God^ and the Gospel the Lord prepared the way  for transfering it to the Gentiles

It is of equal antiquty with the Eagle. 10th 11th  & 12th The golden sacrament dishes and chalice; golden  tankards and golden Salt seller of State. Then there is  a golden Baptismal Font of the royal family upwards of 4  feet in height ten golden Salt sellars used at the coronation  banquet and six golden sceptres of kings and queens  31 is a king's sceptre with the cross of precious stones  and 32 another sceptre with the stone of jewels  33 an ancient sceptre adorned with valuable jewels  34 the Queens sceptre with large diamonds and  35 Queen's ivory sceptre mounted in gold  The next is the staff of Edward the Confessor who reigned  in 1041 It is of pure gold and weighs 8 pounds 9 ounces  On the top is a cross wherein a fragment of the real  cross is said to be deposited. Then the queens enammelled  bracelets and kings golden spurs. After this is the  model of the White Tower set with Jewels and then  is the new imperial crown of Victoria. This splended  and unequaled crown is of the imperial form with upright  and almost pointed arches bearing a diamond orb of  the finest brilliants on the top of which is a cross of  the same precious materials adorned with three remarkably  large pearls. In the front of the crown is a large Jerusalem  cross entirely frosted with brilliants and in its centre  a unique sapphire two inches long and nearly as  broad of the purest and deepest azure.    We also ^saw^ the Train of Artillery the  naval department with relics of Trafalga the Small  Armoury containing 150000 stand of arms numerous  other curiosites and the beheading aAxe said to be the

 "But, it may be said, the Kingdom of God  could not be set up in the days of John for he said  the Kingdom was at hand. But I would ask could  it be any nearer than in the hands of John? The  people needed not wait for the day of Pentecost  to find the Kingdom of God for John had it with  him and he came forth from the wilderness crying  'Repent ye for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand' [##Matthew 3:2##]  as much as to cry out 'Here I have the Kingdom  of God and you can obtain it. I am coming  after you and if you do not receive it you will  be damned. And the scriptures represent  that all Jerusalem went out unto John and were  baptized of him. [##Matthew 3:5-6##]    "Here was a legal administrator.  Those who were baptized were subjects for the  King and the laws and oracles of God were there  Therefore the Kingdom of God was there"    No man could have better  authority to administer than John and even  our Saviour submitted to that authority himself  by being baptized of John. [##Matthew 3:13##] Therefore the  Kingdom of God was set up upon the earth even  in the days of John    There is a difference between  the Kingdom of God and the fruit and blessings  which flow from that Kingdom. Because there  were more miracles gifts visions healings tongues &c  in the days of Jesus Christ and his Apostles  & on the day of Pentecost than under John's   administration it does not prove by any means  that he had not the Kingdom of God. It does not  prove this any more than it would that a woman  had not a milk pan because she had not a pan of  milk; for while the pan might be compared to  the Kingdom the milk might be likened to the   blessings of the Kingdom.    John was a Priest after the order of 
 axe which beheaded Queen Anne Boleyn and also  the Earl of Essex    On leaving the Tower we walked to the  Tames and waited for Elder Young who visited the Tunnel  and purchased a moddle of it then returned to our home  and held a meeting in the evening    Leaving Elder Kimball at home  writing to his wife I accompanied President Young on  his visit to Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey  and on the next day I went out with him to find the  Book of Mormon which we heard was published and  for sale by some person unknown. The report was  untrue    Sunday was an interesting day   to us Elders Young Kimball and Priest Williams  attended meeting at St Pauls in the morning and  I met with the Saints at Father Corners and read  and conversed with them and in the afternoon met  at the Academy and had about 50 present Brother Kimball  preached to them    An Independent Minister invited  me home to take tea with him. I accepted his  invitation had an interesting time and preached the  Gospel to him and he received my testimony and offered  me his chapel which would hold 800. He said he  thought he should be baptized and would try and  get his society to do the same    We met again in the evening  and had more at our meeting than ever before. Brother  Brigham Young preached and was followed by brothers  Kimball Williams Corner Hulme and myself    We had a very interesting time  and one offered himself for baptism. There were some  of the Aikenites present one of whom purchased a  Hymn Book. They wished us to call upon them  and thought they would be baptized. We then met  at Father Corner's and communed with the Saints and  had a good time. 
 The Conference reassembled pursuant to adjournment   and opened by prayer.    The scattered members were represented   consisting of nearly 50 members not included in the foregoing    The President then made some remarks   on the office of Patriarch and concluded by moving that   Elder John Albertson be ordained to that office. This   was seconded by Elder Kimball and carried unanimously    Resolved that   G. D. Watt G. J. Adams Amos Fielding William  Kay John Sanders J. Riley Thomas Richardson  James Whitehead Thomas Dunville James Galley   ^&^ George Simpson be ordained High Priests.    Resolved that the following persons be   ordained Elders:    William Miller William Leach, John   Sandy William Moon William Hardman, Wm   Black John Goodfellow Joseph Brotherton, Richard   Benson Theophilus Brotherton John Mc Ilwrick  and William Green.    The Council of the Twelve then   proceeded to organize all the Churches into Conferences   throughout the Kingdom of Great Britain, and   appoint presiding Elders over them.    The Conference then adjourned till 7 o'clock  when it re-assembled and opened by singing and prayer    The Patriarch Peter Mellen was then   called upon to pronounces the Patriarchal blessing and ^upon^   the head of John Albertson previous to his being   ordained to the office of Patriarch. He then laid   his hands upon him and blessed him    The Twelve afterwards laid their   hands upon him and ordained him to the office   of Patriarch.    The High Priests and Elders were   then ordained and much counsel was given by the   President and others of the Twelve    A very richly ornamented cake a present 
 Aaron and had the keys of that Priesthood and came  forth preaching repentance and baptism for the remission  of sins but at the same time crying 'There cometh  one after me mightier than I the latchet of whose  shoes I am not worthy to unloose [##Luke 3:16##]    And Christ came according to the  word of John. He was greater than John because  he held the keys of the Melchisidic priesthood  and Kingdom of God and had before revealed  the Priesthood to Moses; and Jesus in his  teachings says upon this rock I will build my church  and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. [##Matthew 16:18##]  What Rock? Revelation!    Yet Christ was baptized by John  to fulfill all righteousness. "Again He says except  ye are born of water and the Spirit ye cannot  enter the Kingdom of Heaven"; [##John 3:5##] and though the  heavens and the earth pass away my word shall  not pass away"    If a man be born of the water  and the Spirit he can enter into the Kingdom of  God.    It is evident that the Kingdom of  God was upon the earth and John prepared subjects  for that Kingdom by preaching the Gospel to them  and baptizing them. He prepared the way  before the Saviour or came as a forerunner and  prepared for the preaching of Christ    Christ preached through Jerusalem  on the same ground where John had preached and  when the Apostles were raised up they ^also^ worked in  Jerusalem and Jesus commanded them to tarry there  until they were endowed with power from on high [##Luke 24:49##]    Had they not work to do in  Jerusalem? They did work and prepared people  for the Pentecost; but the Kingdom of God was  with them before the day of Pentecost as well as  afterwards. 
 I rejoiced at the prospect which was opening before  us for we had laboured a long time and the work had  gone slow but now a wide opening was being made to  roll on the work of the Lord in the Metroplis of England    But, though slow the work in London  in its early history, and with us in calling the people into  the Kingdom of God like as with the servants of the  King in the parable, whose invitation to the Marriage  Feast was met, every man with his excuse yet the Lord  had been with us, and the prophetic spirit was abundant  with testimonies of our mission. Doubtless this prophetic  view of the future made our missionary labours in  the great Babylon of modern times less wearisome  than it otherwise would have been. The Spirit all  along bore testimony to us that there would be a great  work done in London and Elder Kimball prophesied  that there would the greatest numbers and the largest  conference. This has since been abundantly fulfilled  for London has become the metropolis of the foreign  missions of the Church    On the seventh of the month we  all acompanied Dr Copeland to the college of Surgeons  and next visited the National Gallery and other  parts of the city and then returned and took tea after  which Elder Kimball baptized one at the Bath  in Taberancle Square. Brothers Young Williams  and myself walked into another part of the town  and had a view of "Life in London."    A Visit to the Stables of the Queen    It was a rainy day in London but we  had all concluded to visit St James' Park Buckingham  Palace and the Queens stables. Brothers Young  and Williams went on before us to see the   Queen's Horse Guards but it came on the rain and  they returned home thinking we should not come  so we did not see them during the whole of the

A large fragment   was left for some who were not present    While the cake was passing Parley P. Pratt  composed the following lines    When in far distant regions   As strangers we roam   Far away from our country   Our friends and our home   [FIGURE]  When sinking in sorrow   Fresh courage we'll take   As we think on our friends  And remember the cake    Elder Orson Hyde appealed powerfully to the meeting   and covenanted with the Saints present in a bond   of mutual prayer during his mission to Jerusalem   and the East which was sustained on the part of   the congregation by a hearty Amen.    Elder Joseph Fielding made some remarks  and spoke of the rich cake and considered it a type   of the good things of that land from whence it came   and from whence they had received the fulness of the   Gospel.    After a hymn was sung President Young   blessed the congregation and dismissed them    Brigham Young Chairman ^President^  Thomas Ward Clerk    A Capital Note of Church History    It is most worthy of note in the history of the   Latter-Day Church that this was not only the 
 It was also with John and he preached the   same Gospel and baptism that Jesus and the Apostles  preached after him.    The endowment of Pentecost was to  prepare the disciples for their mission into the world    "Whenever a man can find out the  will of God and find an administrator legally authorized  from Him there is the Kingdom of God; but where  these are not the Kingdom of God is not. All  the ordinances systems and administrations on the  earth are of no use to the children of men unless  they are ordained and authorized of God for nothing  will same ^save^ a man but a legal administrator  for none other will be acknowledged either by  God or angels    I know what I say. I understand  my mission and business. God Almighty is  my shield and what can man do if God is my  friend? I shall not be sacrificed until my  time comes. Then I shall be offered freely.    All flesh is as grass and the Governor  is no better than other men. When he dies he  is but a bag of dung.    I thank God for preserving  me from my enemies. I have no enmity. I  have no desire but to do all men good. I feel  to pray for all men. We do not ask people  to throw away any good which they have we  only ask them to come and get more. What  if all the world should embrace this Gospel?  They would then see eye to eye and the  blessings of God would be poured out upon the  people which is my whole soul's desire  Amen 
 day. Brother Kimball and myself and two of the  Saints started walked to St James Park and through the  whole length of it and visited the Palace and the Queen's  Stables.    The first stable we entered was that  of the State Horses. They were 12 in number and  the most beautiful cream coloured Hanovarians. They  were the most kind and intelligent of anything of the  brute creation I ever saw and were about seventeen  hands high and well proportioned. We also saw twelve  Arabians and we visited all the stables containing her  Majesty's horses which were one hundred and fifty  in number    We next viewed the appartments  containing the harness for 150 horses. There was  the full set of state harness, for eight cream coloured  Hanavarians, made by order of George IV and was  covered with gold plate and the harness of each horse  weighed 150 lbs. Every set was very expensive being  covered with gold plate    A birds eye view of the Queens  riding ground we took as we passed along and saw  one of the Lords and others of the Household riding  out. Entering the coach houses we saw her Majestys  private coaches a number of which were very grand  and costly and lastly came our inspection of the State   Coach.    Description  of  Her Majesty's State Coach    It was finished in the year 1762, is the most superb  carriage ever built was designed by Sir William Chambers  and built under his direction. The paintings were  executed by Cypriant.

 first but the only time that ^in a foreign^    The First Apostles of the Church   of Latter-day Saints    ever met or will meet as a quorum complete of   The High Council of the Church with nine of   its members present and in General Conference   legislate for the Church in the capacity of a full   quorum. in a foreign land. Moreover of the quorum   of the Twelve Apostles of that date the 9 who at this   General Conerence transacted business as a full council   were the only ones of that quorum who stood faithful   and of those 9 Willard Richards and Parley P. Pratt   have since departed to fill their calling in another   sphere. They therefore in this life can never   meet and act again as on that day    Future Generation deeply interested   in the capital items of the history of this Church   will doubtless deem it worthy of marked record and of   great historical importance to find authoritative data   that the First Apostles of the Church ordained under   the presidentcy of the Prophet Joseph never sat as a   full council nor legislated in their quorum capacity only   in America and England and in this only time in   Foreign Missions Brigham Young sat at their head   and then they organized the British Mission prior   to the return of seven of their number to America and   from that British Mission has branched out the foreign   missions of the Church throughout Europe.    On the day after the Conference I   called at the book store of Elder Parley P. Pratt 47   Oxford Street and found his house full of Elders many   of whom were about parting to go to their fields of   labour.    The clerk of our Conference was somewhat   in trouble as he had this morning lost all the   Minutes of the General Conference and he had 
 On the last day of January we commenced  to sterrotype the "Doctrines and Covenants" of the   Church    On the evening of March the 10th  I saw in the south west quarter of the heavens  a stream of light in the form of a broad sword  with the hilt downwards and the blade raised  pointing from west south west at an angle of  45 degrees from the horison and extending within  two or three degrees to the zenith of the degree where  the sign appeared. It was descovered at 7 o'clock  and gradually disappeared from half past seven  and at nine o'clock it was entirely gone.    This sign of a drawn sword  in the heavens appeared for several evenings  and on the 14th it moved up near the moon and  formed itself into a large ring around the moon  balls immediately appeared in the ring opposite  each other something in the form of sundogs  and another half ring issued from those balls  something in the shape of a horseshoe extending  outside of the first ring with one line running  through the centre of the moon    Prophetic Declaration of Joseph  upon  The Sign of the Sword in the Heavens    "As sure as there is a God who sits  in the heavens and as sure as He ever spoke by  me so sure will there be a speedy and bloody  war and the broad sword seen last ^night^ is the  sign thereof."    A week or two afterwards there were  also remarkable signs in the heavens. Orson Pratt  Professor of Mathmatics in the University of  Nauvoo sketched a diragram of halos and pharhelia  or circles and mock suns descovered in the heavens

On the panels of each side of the right door—  History recording the reports of fame; and Peace burning the  implements of War. On the    Back Panel    Neptune and Amphitrite issuing from their palace in  a triumphant car drawn by Sea Horses attended by the  Winds Rivers Tritons Naiads &c bringing the tribute  of the world to the British shore. On the upper part  of the back pannel is the Royal Arms beautifully ornamented  with the order of St George; the Rose Shamrock and  Thistle entwined.    The Left Door    Has Mars Minerva and Mercury supporting the  imperial crown of Great Britian and the panels of each  side of left door the Liberal Arts and Sciences protected    The front and forequarter  Panels    over the paintings are plate glass and the whole of   the carriage and body is richly ornamented with a laural,  border and carved work beautifully gilt.    The cCarriage and Body of the coach is composed  of four large Tritons who support the body by four braces  covered with blue Morocco ornamented with gilt buckles  The two figures placed in front of the carriage bears the  driver and are represented in the action of drawing by  cables extending round their shoulders, and the Cranes  and Sounding Shells to anounce the approach of the  Monarch of the Ocean; and the figures at the back carry  the Imperial [blank] topt with Tridents.

 to re-write them before they could go to press.    The Twelve spent some time in council in   the forepart of the day and in the afternooon they with all the   American brethren present went to Bro Millers and took tea  and had an interesting time together    Before we left the Twelve laid their   hands upon the head of Orson Hyde and blessed him in the   name of the Lord as he had been set apart to go to the Holy   Land, Jerusalem as a messenger and forerunner of the   return of Israel to build up the waste places of Jerusalem  Much of the Spirit rested upon us when we blessed him   Elder Kimball was mouthpiece and Elder Taylor Scribe    I walked into the city with Brother Brigham  Young and each of us bought a pair of pebble spectacles and   a small spyglass.    I wrote a letter to Elder Edward Ockey   and also to my wife and receved 4 pounds 10 shillings from   Elder John Hollick by the hand of Elder Levi Richards    Good Friday Elder Kimball baptized Brother   Brotherton who then came to Elder Parley P. Pratt and   was confirmed. We dined at his house after which we   all walked to the Zoollogical Gardins. There were fifteen   of the American brethren present. We returned and   took tea at Bro Mc Kendricks    Next day I accompanied Elder Taylor   to the railway station and he took his departure for   Liverpool.    On the Sunday I preached in the   Carpenters Hall in the morning and was followed   by Parley P. Pratt and in the afternoon the sacrament   was administered and amny testified of the work   In the evening Elder O. Pratt preached from ##Daniel##   upon the Kingdoms symbolised in that book and   Elders Kimball and Young followed him.    I spent the 14th counting out the   Millennial Star and had 76 volumes as my share   of the property and I had sold 40 Hymn Books   to P. Pratt a few days previous 
 on the morning of March the 23rd    There were also other signs and it was singular  that in the case of the sign of the sword that on the opposite  side of the horison there was seen a black streak about the size  and shape of the light one. The one was black as darkness  while the other had considerable the appearence of the   blaze of a comet.    On the 12th of April the Steam boat  Amaram arrived at Nauvoo with 230 Saints from England  led by Lorenzo Snow    The next day the Steam boat Maid of  Iowa arrived with 250 Saints who had been in St Louis  during the Winter. Many were my old acquaintances  and friends. Parley P. Pratt and Dr. Levi Richards  were among the number    The Saints newly arrived were made  welcome and the following day they assembled and  was addressed by the Prophet.    The Prophet Joseph  on the  Resurrection of the Saints    Joseph had been requested to preach a funeral  sermon by several who had lost friends and he had  just received information of the death of Elder Lorenzo  Barnes in England and who was the first missionary  of the Church from America wthoat died in a foreign  land. After reading the letter which brought   the melancholy news he addressed the assembly  of Saints in the Temple on the 16 of April in a  very feeling discourse. Among other Remarks  he said    "He should have been more reconciled  to the death of Elder Barnes could his body have been  laid in the grave in Nauvoo or among the Saints    He ^I^ had^ve^ very peculiar feelings

On the centre of the roof  stands three boys representing the genii of England  Scotland and Ireland supporting the imperial  crown of Great Britain and holding in their hands  the sceptre, sword of State and ensigns of knighthood  Their bodies are adorned with festoons of laurals  which fall from thence towards the four corners    The inside of the body is lined  with rich scarlet embossed velvet superbly laced and  embroidered with gold as follows: In the centre of   the roof is the star encircled by the collar of the  Order of the Garter and surmounted by the Imperial  crown of Great Britain; pendant, The George and Dragon;  in the corners, the Rose Shamrock and Thistle  entwined.

 Next day we bid adieu to Manchester   We left Elder Parley P. Pratt and family in good health   and spirits. We left him with a store of Books of Mormon   Hymn Book Voice of Warning Poems Tracts and Stars   for sale.    Elders Young O Pratt myself G. A. Smith   and Levi Richards took train to Liverpool and   brother G. A. Smith and myself took up our abode   at Bro Haringtons near Scotland Road    We arrived just in time to attend   a splendid tea meeting of the Saints at the Music   Hall Liverpool. This Hall the Church had rented   for the Latter day Saints meeting place and it would   hold about 2000. There was ^were^ now sat down to   table at this tea meeting about 200 Saints    This was the first time I had   visited Liverpool since I first landed. It gave me   peculiar feelings to set down to the festive board with   200 Saints and to think that when we first landed   there was not a soul in that great place who belonged   to the Church but ourselves    After tea we were introduced to   this intelligent body of Saints and the Twelve addressed   them in a few words.    After the meeting our quorum   met for a few minutes and concluded to sail on   the following Thursday    The next day was an exceedingly   busy day for the Saints were coming in from the   various parts of England to sail for New York on board   the ship Rochester with us among whom was   brother Ockey and family and brother Fidoe and family   from Herefordshire    With Elder John Taylor I visited the   agents of the ship on which we were going and we   detained the ship one day on our account    This company was disposed to do   all they could to favour us for it was to their interest 
 relative to receiving an honourable burial with his ^my^ fathers  He ^I^ wanted to be laying by the side of his ^my^ father when  the trumpet of God should ^shall^ sound and the voice of  God say "Ye Saints arise so that when the toomb  should  ^shall^ burst he ^I^ could ^can^ arise from the grave and  first salute his ^my^ father and say O my Father! and  his ^my^ father O my Son! as they took ^we take^ each other by  the hand.    He ^I^ wished next to salute his my brothers  and sisters and then the Saints    It was upon this principle that  the ancients were so particular to have an honourable  burial with their fathers as in the case of Joseph   Before his death he made his kindred promise to  carry to carry his bones to the land of Canaan and  they did so. They embalmed his body and took  it to the land of Canaan and buried it with his fathers [##Genesis 50:25-26##] [##Exodus 13:19##]    There is a glory in this which  many do not comprehend. It is true that in the  resurrection the Saints will be caught up to meet  the Lord and they will all be brought together though  their bodies were scattered upon the face of the whole  earth. Yet they could not as readily salute  each other as though ^they^ had laid down and rose up  together from the same bed.    To bring it to the understanding  it would be as though two who were very dear friends  indeed should lie down upon the same bed at night  locked in each others embrace talking of their love and  in the morning awaking together they could immediately  renew their conversation ^even^ while rising from their bed  But if they were alone and in seperate appartments they  could not as readily salute each other as though they   were together    He remarked that Should  he ^I^ live and have an opportunity of gathering his ^my^  friends together who had^ve^ died he ^I^ intended to do so  but should he ^I^ not live to do it him^my^self he ^I^ hoped that 
 by the horses harness and coaches and above are the families  of the coachmen grooms and those connected with the Mews    Mr James West her Majestys state coachman  invited us to dine with him and we did so. We saw  all of his State dresses which were richly trimmed and  ornamented with gold. One coat was exceedingly heavy  in consequene of the weight of gold trimmings. When we  left him he made us a present of three small ornaments  for Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball and Willford  Woodruff. They were made of fine polished brass  about 4 inches in circumference with a lion in the centre  and a crown upon the top. They were worn as ornaments  upon the Queen's State Coach. While at the Mews  we were allowed the privilege of being weighed in the  scales in which Prince Albert was weighed. Elder  Kimballs weight was 160 mine was 142 which  was 2 pounds more than I had ever weighed before    The State coachman informed   me that her Majesty would be quite familiar and  even sociable in some respects with some of her subjects  but was kept distant by her Ministry    From the Royal Mews we walked  to the National Gallery and having viewed the  paintings we returned home somewhat weary for  we had walked ten miles in a rainy day    Next day we had a long and pleasant  days walk in accompanying brother Brigham Young  in his visit to St Paul's and other noted places.    From the body of the cathedral  we ascended to the Whispering Gallery thence to the  Golden Gallery and then to the Ball where we all  three sat together 400 feet from the ground.    Descending we visited the Library  the Bell the Clock and finally every part of the  building and lastly the Crypt among all the toombs  It cost 7/6 each to visit every part of the cathedral    From St Pauls to the Monument  to its top and descending thence to London Bridge 
 as we had already given them many passengers and the probability   was that we should give them many more.    They gave us and all our company the   second deck ^cabin^ and for our quorum they fitted up a seperate room   at half price    Thus there was a great difference between   the circumstances of our landing in Liverpool on the 11th of   January 14840 as strangers in a strange land and penniless   and that of our setting sail on the 20th of May ^April^ 1841 with   a ship load of Saints and influence sufficient to detain the   sailing of the vessel at our will.    Truly the Lord had blessed us in a  degree unlooked for. Indeed it was a miracle what the Lord   had wrought by our hands since our arrival a little over a   year before and I was filled with amazemient as I looked   back for during that time we had established churches   in nearly all the principal towns and cities in England   baptized more than 5000 souls published 5000 Books   of Mormon 3000 Hymn Books 2500 vols of the  Millennial Star and about 50,000 tracts besides   gathering to America 1000 members of the Church and   establishing ^a great influence^ among the shiping companies of Liverpool   which in a few years after had grown to such importance  as to become quite a ruling power not only in Liverpool   but in England generally. Indeed to such proportions   did the emigration power and notoriety of the Church   grow that in its history our emigration agent has been   summoned before a committee of the House of Commons   upon emigration policy and the company of the Great   Eastern Steam Ship has sought of our people to charter   their Leviathan of the Sea    I spent the following day in running   to and fro through the city assisting the Saints. I   walked four miles in the evening on the sea shore with   a company of Saints and baptized two persons one   was Sister Elizabeth Ockey. Her sister Ann accompanied   her to the water and they both much desired to sail   with us to America with their brother Edward, but 
 some of his [blank] would ^will^    He ^I^ wished all the Saints to be comforted  with the victory they wereill to gain by the resurrection.  It is sufficient to encourage the Saint to overcome in  the midst of every trial trouble and tribulation. Though  thunders roar and earthquakes bellow, lightnings flash  and wars be on every hand yet suffer not a joint to tremble  nor let your heart faint for the great Elohiem will  deliver you; and if not before, the resurrection will  set you eternally free from all those things and  from pain sorrow and death.    I have laboured hard and sought  every way to try to prepare this people to comprehend  the things which God is unfolding to me    In speaking of the resurrection  I would say that God hath s^h^own unto me a  vision of the resurrection of the dead; and I saw  the graves open and the Saints as they arose took  each other by the hand even before they got up  or while getting up and great joy and glory rested  upon them. 
 which we crossed and continued to the Southwark  Suspension Bridge which we walked under viewed  and then crossed it. The Bridge is forty five rods  in length. We then dined in the city and  afterwards took a cab and rode to the Museum  and went through every appartment of it. This  ended the day and we returned to our lodgings  in a cab very weary and somewhat ^foot^sore for  we had walked twelve miles and ascended  and descended twelve hundred steps. However  we enjoyed a good night's rest    On the morrow we walked over  Blackfriars and called at Zion's chapel to attend  a sacrament meeting of Mr Aitken's society but   they knowing who we were would not let us in for  they feared lest we should break up their society  by the power of our mission    Thus turned away we crossed home  and held meeting in the evening when I preached and  Elders Young and Kimball bore strong testimony  to the people.    Next day Brother Brigham left  London for Cheltenham and I visited Mr James  Albon a minister of the Independent order who with  his household beleived our doctrine and on the Sunday  we found more than ever an interest being awakened  in London, and our prayer meeting the next evening  was attended by the Reverend James Albon who received  our testimony. We walked home with him and  found his household growing in the faith and ready  for the work of the Lord.    Two days after in the evening we  baptized four two of whom were Mr and Mrs Morgan  with whom we lodged and their apprentice ^Christopher Smith^ and Henry  Corner Junr 
 they were not ready. I retired to bed at midnight very   weary with my day's labour    Next day seven of the Twelve and   120 Saints with them got our baggage on board to set   sail but the wind being contrary we staid on shore.   This was an exceedingly busy day in settling my business   and preparing for my voyage homewards    Among other matters I received the  following Books of Mormon: 12 Morocca 9 shillings   each; 25 Gilt Edge 7 shillings; 89 marble edge six and   six pence; 35 sheep 5 shillings each. Total value fifty   one pounds sixteen shillings and six pence. Of these   I made the following distributions; To Ezra Carter   and family, 9 Morocca lettered; My father and family   5 Morocca lettered; Willard Richards 2 gilt edge 6 marble   edge & 4 sheep skin bound; George A Smith 4 marble   edge and 2 sheep skin; and to others of the Saints I   made similar presents of Books of Mormon in all   to the number of 42.    The sisters Elizabeth and Ann  Ockey made me a presrent of a nice neck-scarf silk   handkerchief and gold pin and their brother Edward  presented me with a purse of 50 sovereigns. Truly   this was liberality not often met; and as some of my   brethren were more needy than myself I devided a   portion of his generous gift with my companions; to   Brigham Young £5; Willard Richards £5; and George   A Smith £5. I said Truly the Lord hasd been   good to us all oIn this mission and had given us all   that we needed.    I took tea with borther Edward Ockey   and sisters on my last evening on shore and oin the   morning went on board the Rochester with Brigham   Young Heber C Kimball O^rson^ Pratt George A. Smith   Willard Richards John Taylor and R. Hedlock. We   bade farewell to Parley P. Pratt Orson Hyde and   a multitude of the Saints who stood upon the   quay to see us start and then the ship drew out 
 On the 19th of the month in Conference with  the Twelve Joseph counciled us to take our mission  to the east to obtain means to build the Temple and  Nauvoo House as we were appointed by the General  Conference on the 6th of April. At that aniversary  of the rise of the Church The following persons were named  of the quorum of the Twelve for this mission to hold  Conferences in the east obtain means &c:    Brigham Young Heber C Kimball  Orson Hyde Orson Pratt William Smith Willford  Woodruff and George A Smith. John E Page  was to join us in the east.    There were also ^some^ appointed for other  missions. Rebun Hedlock S James and ^J^ Carnes  were appointed to go to England and Addison Pratt  and three others were appointed to go to the Sandwich  Islands.    Brigham Young Heber C Kimball  Joseph Young G. A. Smith and Peter Haws and myself  went to Agusta to hold Conference on Sunday  the 30th. He found about 200 Saints in this place  They had started a flourishing vilage three saw  mills and two flowering mills and one of the best  water privileges I ever saw. We returned to  Nauvoo on the first of May    A company of about one hundred  gentlemen and ladies on the Maid of Iowa took a pleasure  excursion to Burlington. Joseph his lady, his  mother and family were of the party.    The Council of the Twelve met  two days after and appointed missions to England  Scotland and the Pacific Isles    On Sunday the 14th I was at Lima   with Joseph to hold meeting there. George A Smith  and B. Nobles had also accompanied him while Brigham  Young Heber C. Kimball and Orson Pratt were filling  appointments elsewhere.    After singing and prayer Joseph delivered 
 The afternoon On ^of^ the following day Dr Copeland spent the  with us and he received our testimony and in the evening  we preached at our meeting place.    I had visited the Rev. James Albon  several times and given him an account of the rise  and progress of the Church of Christ of Latter-day  Saints. He beleived in our mission and offered  me his chapel to preach in which would seat about  two thousand.    Sunday morning we accompanied  our reverend friend and convert to his chapel and were  introduced to the Commttee one of whom was a preacher  who had travelled much in Russia and other parts of  the world. At the close of the meeting the Rev. James  Albion gave out an appointment for us to preach  on the next Sabbath evening    In the afternoon we met with  the Saints confirmed four and had a full house  and in the evening we preached again and a good  feeling prevailed    After meeting the Rev James Albon  called upon us at our room and told us that he  had given out our appointment to preach in his  chapel and had informed his congregation that he  was a Latter-day Saint and should be baptized  and join our Church and that they need no longer  consider him a member of their body unless they  with him joined the Saints. He told us  this made a division among the Committee:  some were for going with him and some against  following their pastor into the true fold which  he had found    The afternoon of the Monday  was spent with Dr Copeland with whom we went  to the "Concerts d'Hiver" and heard a fine performance  of a magnificient band of about 100 mostly German  and French conducted by Mr Ellason. It was  a musical treat. 
 into the river Mercy and cast anchor. This was on the 20th   of April    Next day Wednesday the 21st the wind being favourable   we weighed anchor at 12 o'clock and started on our voyage, and   had a good breze^eze^ through^out^ the day but most of the passengers   were sea sick    The Rochester was a fast sailing vessel   of about 1000 tons and there was on board 1020 Saints including   seven of the Twelve; 160 not of our people and the ships   company making in all 307 souls.    On the seventh day of our voyage   we had all the pleasure with a touch or two of the   disasters of    A Storm at Sea.    In the morning we found strong head winds   which soon increased to a powerful storm and the scene   which followed was full of grandeur and considerable   discomfiture to our company.    The sails were taken in as soon as   possible and it took 16 men to close reef the main topsail    The tempest in its rage was now all   powerful & the sea piled up into mountains. Ever and   anon our ship was thrown up on the crest of one of   those ocean mountains and then pitched into the valeley  beneath rocking tremendously and occassionly shiping   seas    In the midst of this was a cry for help   was heard in our cabin. I rushed to the scene from   whence the cry came and found the ropes giving   way which held the luggage piled up between decks   Had this broken loose one surge would have hurlled   heavy trunks barrels &c into the births [berths] of the men   woman and children which would have endangered   the lives of many. On seeing the foundation   of this mass give way Willard Richards and   myself sprang to the place of danger and braced 
 a discourse of which I noted the following:    Gems ^Items^  of  A Discourse by Joseph    "It is not wisdom that we should have all knowledge  presented at once before us but that we should have  a little at a time. Then we can comprehend it"    -[The speaker then read the Second Epistle  of Peter 1st ch. from the 16th to the last verse and  dwelt upon the 19th verse. Among other remarks  upon the words of the Apostle, "Add to your faith  knowledge" &c [##2 Peter 1:5##] the Prophet said]-    "The principle of knowledge is the principle  of salvation. This doctrine can be comprehended for any  one who cannot obtain ^will receive^ knowledge to be saved will be  damned    The principle of salvation is given to  us through the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Salvation  is nothing more nor less than to triumph over all our  enemies and put them under our feet in this world  and a knowledge to triumph over all evil spirits in  the world to come: Then we are saved; as in the  case of Jesus Christ. He was to reign until he  had put all enemies under his feet and the last enemy  was death    Perhaps there is a principle here  that few men have thought of. No person can have  this salvation except through a tabernacle    Now in this world mankind are  naturaly selfish and ambitious and striving to excel  one above another yet some are willing to build up   others as well as themselves    So in the other world there is a variety  of spirits some of whom seek to excel. This was 
 I sat two hours and half for my  portrait on the Wednesday and had an interesting chat  with the artist Mr Pistrucci an Italian, in the midst  of which brother Kimball called for me and I took  a walk with him and Dr Copeland and his wife  over Blackfriars Bridge.    On our return home we lost  brother Kimball and sister Copeland in the crowd  and in looking for them I lost the Doctor &  brother Kimball sister Copeland so that there were  no two of the four together. After awhile however  we all luckily met at Covent Garden and saw  the wonderful performance of Shakspears Night  Dream and Madam Vestris the celebrated actress  and popular favourite    Christmas Eve Brother Kimball  and myself went into the streets to see the busy  multitude returned to our room and took supper in  keeping with the season retired to bed and dreamed  of falling among thieves    Christmas Day in London    Christmas is the greatest day of the year in England  and this was the first Christmas day I ever spent in a   foreign land.    In the morning the church bells throughout  London chanted for meeting and the Saints also met for  service. After morning service comes what gives the  halo of glory and jolity to Old Christmas—the dinner. The  service of the day is something like the blessing before meat  but the Christmas ^dinner^ is an institution with the nation and  Christmas holds his feast of State in every city town and  hamlet—in every palace mansion and cottage and comfortless  is the wretched place which merry Christmas enters not    Our Christmas dinner was eat with brother  Morgan and family and the evening was spent with the  Rev. Mr Albon in conversing about the things of God. 
 ourselves against the barrels and held them for a  few moments until they were secured. I then went on   the deck to the Captain and informed him of the situation   of things below and he sent the sailors with some   ropes and they secured the pile.    Afterwards I again went to the aft  quarter deck to behold the raging of the tempest and   the wonders of the deep and the riding of our bark   on the mountain billows. It was the grandest   scenery I ever beheld upon the sea    Elders Young Kimball Richards  and Smith was ^were^ with me on deck for a time but   all had now gone below with the exception of Elder   Willard Richards myself the captain and crew    We were shipping heavy seas. It   was now past sunset and I stood in the middle of   the aft quarter deck holding the captain's speaking  trumpet it one hand and to a fast bench with the   other when we shipped a tremendious sea on the   windward side of us which passed clear over the  quarter deck upon which I stood. On seeing that   we could not escape it Elder Richards threw himself   under the shelter of the bulwarks, and the body   of the wave went clear over him without wetting   him more than a little but as I could not   take the same advantage I threw myself   upon the deck and held fast to the seat until   the sea passed over me and left me drenched   with the surge. I now though[t] it time to leave   my seat of observations for the day. So I   went below and went to bed for I was thoroughly   wet.    I did not sleep however but little   for the ship rocked at a dreadful rate; boxes barrels   and tins were tumbling from one end of the cabin   to the other and in the steerage about fifteen births   were thrown down. 9 at one surge with men   woman and children flung into a heap. There 
 the case with the Devil. When he fell he sought for  things which were unlawful. Hence he was cast  down and it is said that he drew away many  with him and the greatness of his punishment  is that he shall not have a tabernacle. This  is his punishment.    So the Devil thinking to thwart  the decree of God goeth up and down the earth  seeking whom he may destroy. Any person  whom he can find who will yeild to him he  will find and take possession of the body and reign  there glorifying mightily forgeting that he has a  stolen body. By and by some one having authority  comes along and casts him out and restores the  tabernacle to its rightful owner. The devil steals  a tabernacle because he has not one of his own but  when he has stolen it he is liable to be turned out  of doors"    -[Upon the 19th verse the Prophet  rememarked]-    "Now there is some grand secret  here and a key to unlock the subject. Notwithstanding  the Apostle exhorts them to add to their faith virtue  knowledge temperance &c [##2 Peter 1:5-6##] yet he exhorts them to make  their calling and election sure [##2 Peter 1:10##]. Though they had  heard the audible voice from heaven bearing testimony  that Jesus was the Son of God yet he says we have   a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well  that ye take heed as unto a light shining in a  dark place [##2 Peter 1:19##]    Now wherein could they have a  more sure word of prophecy than to hear the voice of  God saying this is my beloved Son? Now for the  secret and grand key.    Though they might have heard  the voice of the Father and know that Jesus was  the Son of God this would be no evidence that their  calling and election was made sure and that 
 The Sunday following in the evening we preached  by the appointment of its minister in the Indipendant chapel to  the largest congregation we had discoursed before, in London.  There were present priests and people of many denominations. I  addressed them for about the space of one hour. A Wesleyan  Minister arose and opposed me which had a good effect  for the congregation seeing the spirit he was of turned  against him and the Committee refused him the permission  to speak there any more. I was much bound by the  opposing spirit still the conduct of ^the^ enemy gave us friends    The next evening we attended what  was said to have been the largest Temperance meeting  ever held in London and the next two days brought us  to the    Close of the Year.    Synopsis  of  the Travels and Labours of Willford Woodruff  in 1840    Places Visited or Laboured in:    Liverpool Preston Manchester New Castle, Tunstell  Burslem Hanley Stoke, & Longton Stafford  Wolverhampton Birmingham Worcester  Hereford Ledbury Malvern Hill  Gloucester Cheltenham Oxford  London    Miles Travelled:  4469    Meetings Held by me 230;  & Places established for Preaching 53,  I planted Churches to the number of 47  and jointly organized them. 
 were however no lives lost or bones broken. This was the   eighth ^seventh^ day in succession that we had strong head winds    Next day we had fair wind for the   first time and the sun shined pleasantly but the sea   was very rough from the gale    One day near this date I was requested   toby the brethren to carry the dishes to the cooks galley   So I got my hands full of dishes of various kinds and  just as I had reached the door of the galley the ship   gave a tremendious lunge so that she was thrown on   her beam-ends with her stud sails in the water. This   unexpected pitch of the ship plunged me head foremost  about ten feet the whole length of the galley against   its side with the cook upon me    This was my first introduction   to the cook since I had been to sea. I beged his pardon   for such an abrupt enterance and withdrew leaving   the cook with three smashed fingers (caused by   trying to save me in the fall) to pick up my   dishes at leasure which were scattered from one end   of his galley to the other. I had no desire for a   long time to come to pay the cook a similar visit    Passing over the remaining incidents   of a voyage accross the Atlantic in an emigrant   ship we landed in New York on the 20th of   May    Next day George A. Smith and   myself took up our abode with Elder L. R. Foster  who was glad to see us and made us welcome  and brothers Young Kimball and Orson Pratt  took up lodgings at the house of Elder G. J. Adams    At this time I met my brothers in   law Ezra and Ilus Carter and also Dr Charles  Fabyan    I had the purusal of the 12 and   13th Nos. of the Times and Seasons giving an   account of the laying of the corner stones of the   House of the Lord in Nauvoo in the presence 
 they had a part with Christ and was a joint heir with him  They would then need that more sure word of prophecy that  they were sealed in the heavens and had the promise  of Eternal Life in the Kingdom of God. Then having  this promise sealed unto them it was as an anchor to  their soul sure and steadfast. Though the thunders  might roll & lightenings flash, earthquakes bellow and war  gather thick around yet this knowledge would support the  soul in every hour of trial and tribulation    Then knowledge through our Lord  and Saviour Jesus Christ is the grand key which unlocks  the glories and mysteries of the kingdom of heaven    Compare this principle of knowledge  which thus unlocks the glories and mysteries of the  Kingdom with Christendom at the present time and  where are they with all their religion piety and sacredness?  Yet at the same time they are crying out against  Prophets Apostles Angels Revelations Visions &c  Why they are just ripening for the damnation of  hell. They will be damned for they reject the  most glorious principle of the Gospel of Jesus Christ  and treat with disdain and trample under foot the  main key which unlocks the heavens and puts  into our possession the glories of the celestial world  Yes I say such will be damned with all their  professed godliness    "Then I would ^also^ exhort you to go on  and continue to call upon God until you make your  calling and election sure for yourselves by obtaining  this more sure word of prophecy and wait  patiently for the promise until you obtain it"    Many other choice remarks were made  on this occassion which I did not note down.    After the close of the meetings of  that Sunday at which George A Smith Lorenzo Snow  and myself also took parts we rode to Lima and took 
 These Churches were chiefly comprised in the two  Conference raised up in Herefordshire, consisting of  about 1500 Saints, 28 Elders, 110 Priests, 27^4^ Teachers,  and 10 Deacons.    Baptisms of the Year  were three hundred and thirty six persons under  my own hands, and I assisted in the baptism of  eighty six others.    I baptized 57 Preachers,   mostly of the connection of the United Brethren,  and also 2 clarks of the Church of England.    Confirmations of the Year:    I confirmed 420 and assisted in confirming  50 others    Ordination to the Priesthood.    I ordained 18 Elders, 97 Priests, 347 Teachers  and 1 Deacon.    Children Blessed & the Sick Healed    I blessed 120 Children and administered to 120,  sick by prayer, anointing and the laying on of  hands, and in many instances the sick were healed  and devils were cast out    Book of Mormon Hymn Book & Millennial Star    I assisted in procuring 1000 pounds for the publication  of 3000 copies of the Book of Mormon ^Hymn Book^ 5000 copies of  the Book of Mormon and for the printing of the  Millennial Satar, and to assist two hundred Saints  to emigrate to Nauvoo.    Letters    I wrote 200 letters and received 112  End of 1840. 
 of ten thousand persons    On this day May the 22nd the ceremony   of marriage was performed by Elder Woodruff between   Mr Edward Ockey and Miss Eliza Brewer both from   Castle Froom Herefordshire at the house of Elder   J. W. Latson in the presence of the quorum of the   Twelve.    This was the first marriage   ceremony I ever officiated in and I was much   interested in the welfare of the bride and brid[e]groom   for they were both my children in the Gospel and   Elder Edward Ockey had not only been munificient   in gifts to me but he has also given between two   and three hundred pounds to help the poor   Saints to emigrate    On the Sunday after we landed   the Council of the Twelve met; and afterwards at   our meeting place the National Hall Canal Street   for public worship. There was a large congregation   Many of the citizen were present besides the   Saints from London Liverpool Manchester and   various parts of England Ireland and Scotland    While in New York, with Dr   Bernhisel Willard Richards and George A Smith  I visited the Frigates Brandy wine and North Carolina   and crossed the river to Jersey side went through   the steam ship of war then building for the   Emperor of Rusia. We also visited some of the  public buildings of New York    On the last of May with my   brotherin-law Ilus Carter I took steamboat to   start to my family in the State of Maine for   my wife soon after the death of my daughter   was with my infant son Willford taken to the home   of her father by her brother, ^and brother in law^ Carter    On the 2nd of June I arrived   at Scarborough per stage and was once more   permitted to embrace my wife and also my first 
 supper with Calvin Bea^by^ and while we were conversing  with brother Joseph and brother Morely we were treated  to the following    Sayings of the Prophet    "The way to get along in any important matters  is to call unto yourself wise men experienced and  aged to assist in council in all times of trouble    "Handsome men are not wise and  strong minded men. The strength of a strong minded  man will create course features like a rough and  strong bough of the oak. You will always discover  in the first glance at a man in the outline of   his features something of the mind of the man"    Excitement has almost become the  essence of my life. When that dies away I feel  almost lost. When a man is reined up continually  he becomes strong and gains power and knowledge  but when he relaxes for a season he loses much  of his power    But in all matters whether temporal  or spiritual—preaching the Gospel or leading an  army to battle victory almost entirely depends upon  moderation and good discipline. In going to battle  move slowly dress up into line and though your  enemy rush upon you with fury meet them with  calm firmness. Let not confussion seize your  breast but receive them slow and firmly; then  strike a heavy blow and conquer    A man can bear a heavy burden  by practice and by continuing to increase it    The inhabitants of this continant were 
 [first half of page blank]    New Year's Day    I found myself in the metropolis of England the most  famous city of the world and with me Heber C Kimball  and we both were in the enjoyment of good health    The Church of Latter-Day Saints on this  new year's day 1841 in the City of London numbered 21  souls and I celebrated the commencement of the new  year by baptizing two into the fold of Christ. We dined  at Dr Copeland's.    There was a heavy thunder storm on  the Sunday which damaged some of the churches in  the City. Notwithstanding we in the afternoon preached  in the Academy communed with the Saints and  confirmed two and ^preached^ again in the evening    We took tea with the Rev James Albon   and Mr Spencer and were told that there was quite a  stir in the Indipendant Church where I had preached  the Sunday previous. Most of the Committee who  were eight in number were with their pastor beleiving  in our mission and there was a prospect of their being  baptized while others were much stirred up and  opposing.    A few days after in the evening we  accompanied the Rev. Mr Albon to London Dock to 
 born son whom I had not before seen. After 2 years of  seperation from my wife it was a happy meeting now    Here I stayed with my fatherin-law   until the 5th of July and then left for my native place   Farmington where I arrived on the 3rd day after.    While tarrying at my father's house   I married my sister Eunice Woodruff to Mr Dwight  Webster. At    My Sister's Marriage    there were between 40 and fifty persons mostly our relatives   This was on the 4th of August 1841    A few days afterwards my aunt Bulah Hart  was baptized into the Church and on the 18th of the   month I bade farewell to my father's house after a stay   of forty one days. This was a longer visit than I had   paid to any of my friends for the last ten years    Two days after we reached New Haven   the capitol of my native State which I had not seen   for 15 years and it gave me pleasure to see it once more    I arrived in New York with my   family on the 21st. Here I learned the general news of   the day which was fully ominous and rumours of war between   England and America heard on every hand    The Millennial Stars from England   as well as the letters received informed me of the rapid   progress of the work in that country in the midst of   unparalelled opposition.    From the Times and Seasons I   gathered the items that the work in Nauvoo was progressing   in the midst of opposition and that all the returned   members of the Twelve excepting myself had arrived   there. It also brought the melancholy tidings of the   death of Don Carlos Smith editor of the Times and Seasons   The news generally informed me both of the success and   unequalled efforts both in America and England to overthrow   the Church. All earth and hell seemed united for one   great effort. Public meetings were being held and   news papers teening against us. 
 so constituted and were so determined and persevering  either in righteousness or wickedness that God visited  them immediately either with great judgements or blessings    "If the present generation obtain any assistance from  God they will have to obtain it by faith."    As I had spent most of my time for the last  ten years in the vineyard and would probably spend  much more in the future the brethren and myself  talked over the desireableness of my building a house  for my family to be comfortable in my absence.  Several profered to assist me to brick and other materials  and brother John Fidoe would superintend the building  So on the 22nd of May we went on to the ground  and laid out the dimensions of the house    Next day the Twelve set apart Elders  Noah Rogers Addison Pratt Benjamin F. Grouard  and Knowlton Hanks to take mission to the Sandwich   Islands and Elders Hedlock and J Carnes to England  Elder Hedlock was appointed to preside afover the British  Isles. The Spirit of the Lord was with us in  setting apart these brethren and the blessings pronounced  upon their heads were written by Elder Richards    A Trial  before  The Twelve and First Presidency    On the afternoon of the 27th I met in council  with the Twelve and First Presidency when the case of  Benjamin Winchester was brought up on trial for  slandering the Saints in Philadelphia rejecting the   counsel of Hyrum Joseph and the Twelve and for  tearing down instead of building up    Hyrum pledd for mercy Joseph for  right and the Twelve decided according to the testimony 
 house of Mr Spencer to hold a meeting. There were  only six present and five were preachers. One by the  name of Canon was full of the devil and hypocrsisy  and he rejected our testimony and opposed the work  In fact we found that we could not go out to teach in   London without the Devil coming to oppose us.    ^Bro Young^ In letter to brother Kimball informed  us that the two brethren who went from Longton Lancashire  to Nauvoo to spy out the land had returned strong in the faith  and also told us that 500 Books of Mormon were out of  press and in the process of binding    About this time I baptized the daughter  of the Rev. James Albon and the day after Elder Kimball  started to Woolwich to break up the ground there. The  following Sunday was the first time he preached when  four persons offered themselves for baptism.    They walked up and down the river  Thames until 9 o'clock at night to find a place to  administer the ordinance but could not because of  the mud and ice. So on the morrow they came   with Elder Kimball to London to receive the ordinance  of the Gospel.    We immediately repared to our private  bath in Tabernacle Square and Elder Kimball  baptized five persons one of whom was Dr William   Copeland    This was indeed an interesting occasion  and we felt thankful to God to see the cloud begining  to break for we had struggled hard to do the little  which had been done.    On the 15th of the month we baptized  three more of brother Morgan's household and on the   following Sunday I preached to a full house and to many  new hearers. Several offered themselves for baptism  and there had been during the week added unto the  Church seven souls.    Next day Elder Kimball received  a letter from Elder Young who wished us to be 
 On the 9th of September a little company consisting   of myself wife and son and four others started on board   the boat Sandusky for Albany. Our ultimate   destination was Nauvoo w[h]ere we arrived on the   6th of the next month.    While on our journey up the   rivers and on board the Chesepeak bound for Chicago   we stoped at Manitawou Island on account of rough weather   where we lay by until 4 o'clock in the afternoon   of the same day and then put off again    At 12 o'clock at night a tremendious  storm arose. The captain officers crew and passengers   all expected to go to the bottom and judging from   outward appearences there were twenty chances to one  that we should be lost but I experienced no fear   and felt confident that the Lord would save us by   some means. We were in the gale 24 hours when   we succeeded in returning to Manitau Island.    When I left Nauvoo two years   before there were not more than a dozen houses in   the place but on my return to the City there   were several hundreds    We passed by the Temple then   building and had a view of it; and then called   at the house of Elder Brigham Young. Here we   spent the night.    Brother Brigham was sick and   Heber C Kimball and Willard Richards were with   him. We laid hands upon him and he soon   recovered    I saw many of my old friends   and aquaintances and was informed that others of   them were dead.    I met with many friends on the   day after my return to Nauvoo and also sat in   council with the Twelve and was happy once more   to meet with my quorum. I moved my things   to Elder Kimball's. My wife and child were sick. 
 in the case.    Several letters were read touching the  subject and then Elder Winchester made a lengthy  speech trying to justify himself.    President Hyrum Smith followed and plead  in behalf of mercy    Elder George J Adams gave  his testimony against Winchester who afterwards  followed him and both spoke several times    Joseph the Prophet arose and  rebuked Elder Winchester in the sharpest manner  and said he had a lying spirit    After hearing the testimony in the  case Brigham Young President of the Twelve said he  had made up his mind and his decision was  that Elder Winchester should give up his license  and cease preaching until he should reform    President Hyrum Smith said  he should not like to have such a decision given  without another trial to give Elder Winchester a  chance to get more testimony if he could    President Young said he should  then prefer the case turned over to the High Council    Joseph said it was not the business  of the High Council but belonged to the Twelve and  they alone for it concerned matters abroad and  not in Nauvoo. The High Council's business  was to try cases belonging to the city and that of  the Twelve to regulate the churches and Elders abroad  in all the world and Elder Winchester came under  that jurisdiction    Hyrum urged the case to be put off  until the next day    Joseph said the case might be  put of until the next morning if it would do  anybody any good.    Then President Brigham Young  arose and spoke in the majesty of his calling 
 ready to set sail for home early in April.    The day after brother Heber returned from  Woolwich a second time and we held a prayer meeting in the   evening but he was unable to be present at our next preaching  meeting from indisposition    During this week we both took the last  sittings for our portrait and with Dr Copeland visited  the largest docks in London.    First we visited St Catherine's Dock  and after viewing the shipping and freight of every description  we next went to the London Dock    Among many other things we saw the  Eastern Wine Vault. This is much the largest vault  in the world. It is altogether underground and covers  nine English acres.    The whole vault is supported with  tremendous arches and pillars and laid off in the form  of streets. It had been built 33 years.    We walked through the length and  breadth of the vault with a guide each one carrying a  lighted lamp in his hand. Over our heads were the  street and city.    This Vault alone contains thirty thousand  Pipes of the best Port Wine and six thousand Pipes of Sherry  and ^the lower^ three minor vaults of great extension filled with  the same article; besides many thousand Pipes of wine  and Brandy Gin and other liquors were strewed through  all the docks warfs and storehouses. We had a tasting  order and found the wine of the rarest quality. But it   was pitiful to think of the vast sums of money  spent in intoxicating liquors while thousands were  nearly starving for bread in the streets    Leaving this scene we called into  a Jewish Synagogue and stayed during worship  and then returned to our room.    I called for Mr Hender and he  came home with me and soon the Rev. James   Albon also came and we all went to the bath in 
 I was quite unsettled where to turn or which   way to settle myself. Some of my quorum thought it   best for me to got to Warsaw with Elder Willard Richards but after   meeting in conference with the Twelve it was voted that I   should locate myself in Nauvoo    The temporal business of the Church was   laid upon the quorum of the Twelve    On the 30th of October the City Council met   & among its business I was appointed one of the city council of   Nauvoo.    ^Commence here^    The next day was Sunday and I met with   the Twelve and the Presidency at the office of Hyrum  Smith and spent most of the day in council    Joseph severely reproved Benjamin   Winchester for getting out of his place, after which he   taught us principle for several hours. He spoke upon   the gathering of the nations for the building up of the Kingdom   of God &c.    Six days afterwards I attended the   City Council for the first time and was sworn into my   office as councillor    On the seventh which was also Sunday   I for the first time since my return with some of the   Twelve called upon brother Joseph thence to brother   Brigham Young's and then to the meeting.    Here I found many hundreds of   the Elders and members of the Church gathered and Elder   William Clark preached for about two hours    When he had closed brother Joseph   arose and reproved him as pharisceeical and hypocritical   and ^said^ that he had not edified the people    The Prophet then delivered unto us   an edifying address showing us what temperance faith   virtue charity and truth were. He also said if we   did not accuse one another God would not accuse us   If we had no accuser we should enter into the Kingdom   of heaven. He would take us there and if we would   not accuse him he would not accuse us. He said 
 and among other remarks he said that his mind was made  up and that neither the remarks of brother Hyrum nor of Joseph  had altered it. As for himself he would not sit upon the  case another day. He considered it an insult upon his  office and calling as an Apostle of Jesus Christ and he  would not bear it. As for the rest of the Twelve they  might do as they pleased; for himself he would not do  so. Benjamin Winchester had despised and rejected the  counsel of the Presidency and the Twelve and had said  they had no jurisdiction over him in Philadelphia   and power to say where he sho^uld^ go &c. But he and  others will find that there is power in the Twelve.  We know from whom we have received our power  and who are our benefactors and we are thankful  for it. Benjamin Winchester has never for the  first time received our counsel but has gone contrary  to it. No one is safe in his hands. He calls   Hyrum an old granny and slanders everybody.  He says there is contradiction between Hyrum and  the Twelve. There is no contradiction between  us and Hyrum, is there brother Hyrum. (He   answered, "No.")    After Brigham closed Joseph said  he would give us a little counsel if we saw fit to  take it. He thought it proper for us to silence  Elder Winchester take his license and have him  come to Nauvoo with his family and if he would  not do so then let him go out of the Church    A vote was then taken to that effect.    Brother Joseph addressed the Twelve and said  "In all your councils and especially on trial you should  observe all pertaining to the subject and discern the  spirit by which either party is governed. We should  be in a situation to understand every spirit and  judge righteous judgement and should not let the council  be imposed upon by an unruly conduct    "The Saints need not think because  I am familiar with them and am playful and cheerful 
 in Tabernacle Square and I baptized the Rev. Mr Albon  and Mr Hender    Next day we held a prayer meeting  with the Saints and in the afternoon confirmed one  and blessed one child. We took tea with brother Albon  and met a full congregation in the evening    The Opening of Parliament  Jan 26 1841.    This was a great day in London and as Travellers  from another nation as well as missionaries of the   Gospel we did not lose the opportunity of witnessing  the opening of the British Parliament    I started in company with  Heber C. Kimball and Dr Copeland and several others for  St James Park where we arrived at 10 o'clock and  found the citizens of London massing by tens of  thousands for the purpose of having a view of her  Majesty as she passed through the Park to the  House of Lords to open Parliament    Long before two o'clock the whole  line from Buckingham Palace through St. James'  Park along Whitehall and Parliament Street leading  to the House of Lords was one continuous mass of  the inhabitants of London. The windows of the  houses all along was ^were^ crowded with fashionable dressed  ladies, in white on Richmond Terrace, and on the steps  at the base of the Duke of York's monument were  immense bodies of people.    It was judged that there  was ^were^ from three to four hundred thousand gathered  on this occasion but notwithstanding this immense  body of people we had the good fortune through  the favour of one of the Queen's Life Guards  to get a place in the front line    Her Majesty started a quarter  before 2 o'clock. The cortege consisted of five 
 what many persons called sin was not sin and he did   many things to break down superstition.    After the close I met with the Twelve   and High Priest quorum. The ''Word of Wisdom"   having been brought up Elder Brigham Young   said, "Shall I break the "Word of Wisdom if I go home   and drink a cup of tea? No; Wisdom is justified   of her children." The subject was discussed in   an interesting manner and the conclusion reached   that we should deal with such matters in wisdom   and that forced abstinence was not making us   free, but putting a yoke upon our necks    Baptisimal Font Dedicated   The   First Baptisms for the Dead.    Two weeks afterwards which was Sunday the   21st of November after meeting in council   with the Twelve at brother Brigham Young's   I met with the General Assembly near the Temple   and heard a discourse by Elder Taylor followed by   President Hyram Smith.    Afterwards the Twelve met at   President Young's until 4 o'clock when we repaired   to the Baptisimal Font in the Temple for the   purpose of baptizing for the dead for the remission   of sins and for the healing of the sick    It was truly an interesting scene   It was the    First Font    built in this last dispensation for the glorious   provision of the Gospel for the salvation of both   the living and the dead    It was dedicated by President   Joseph Smith and the Twelve and this was the first 
 that I am ignorant of what is going on. Iniquity ^of any^  ^kind^ cannot be retained in the Church, of any kind, and  it will not fare well where I am for I am determined  that while I do lead the Church to lead them right"    Joseph farther ^said^ as concerning Elder Adams  that he had given satisfaction to him confessed  wherein he had done wrong and had asked for  mercy intending to take a right course and begin  anew in the Church.    After much instruction from Joseph   the council adjourned    On the 1st of June the quorum of the Twelve  met in Council at President Joseph Smith's store to make  some arrangements to start on their mission to collect  funds for the Temple and Nauvoo House. We each of  us was bound mader a bond of two thousand dollars  for the faithful performance of our duty in making  strict returns to the Trustee in Trust of all property  put into our hands. Elder Aaron Johnson was  my bondsman    President Joseph Smith gave me  the following    Letter of Commendation  given  To Elder Willford Woodruff    "To all Saints and Honourable Men of the earth Greeting:    "Dear Brethren and Friends,    I Joseph Smith a Servant of  the Lord and Trustee in Trust for the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints do hereby  certify that the bearer hereof Willford Woodruff  and Elder and one of the Twelve Apostles of 
 carriages containing the attendants of Royalty and the State  carriage in which were her Majesty and Prince Albert  who sat on her right    The Queen's Body Guard ^formed^ by the Royal Blues  the Life Guards did duty on the line. The State carriage  was drawn by eight of the cream coloured Hanoverian  horses which we had seen at the Royal Mews.    The whole train passed within ten  feet of us so that we had a fair view of the Queen and  Prince Albert both going and returning from the House  of Lords. Her Majesty was of small stature and  plain in features and her dress was a plain white  satin trimed with white lace and she wore a necklace  of brillants. Prince Albert was quite a handsome man  They continually bowed to the people as they passed along  On her return to the Palace she appeared much fatigued    It was the grandest earthly sight  I ever saw.    Before the close of the month I   baptized three more into the Church and on the   2nd of Feb. we went to Stationers Hall near Saint  Paul's where Elder Kimball made enquiries concerning  the securing of the copyright of the Book of Mormon  and on our way we saw a large fire in Finsbury Square  but it was partly extinguished.    The following evening we held  a meeting and had a good time and appointed a  committee to hire a preaching room. They were Dr  Copeland Rev James Albon and Priest John Cooper.  Brother ^Albon^ wished to make Elder Kimball and myself  a gilt frame each for our portraits which we accepted    I received a letter from Elder Kington  informing me that he had commenced building up a  Church in the city of Bristol. He had baptized five  and organized a Branch of nine members.    On the 4th we took the rail to  Greenwich which stands upon the banks of the 
 time the font had been prepared for the reception of candidates   on the Sabath    A large congregation assembled and Elders Brigham   Young Heber C Kimball and John Taylor went forward   and baptized about forty persons and Elders Willard Richards   George A Smith and myself assisted in confirming them   Afterwards I spent the evening with the quorum of the Twelve   at brother Heber C. Kimballs.    On the 24 of this month I took charge   of the Provision Store for the Committee of the Nauvoo House    The next day about 200 Saints landed at   Warsaw from England and there being a heavy snow storm   I sympathized with them under the hard circumstances of   their arrival    The following Sunday was spent   at Brigham Young's with the Twelve and Joseph conversing  upon a variety of subjects. It was an interesting day   Elder Joseph Fielding was present having been four years   on mission to England. We also saw a number of the   English brethren.    Joseph the Prophet said that    The Book of Mormon was the most correct as   the word of God of any Book on Earth and that a man   would get nearer to God by abiding in its precepts than   by that of any other book. He said it is the key   stone of our religion.    Next Sunday with my wife and   sister Kimball I spent a part of the day at brother   Rushtons with a number of the Pottery Saints from   Staffordshire.    Indeed I was now in the midst of   hundreds whom I had baptized in America the Islands   of the Sea and in England and Wales who had now gathered   to Nauvoo and I was occassionally receiving and   paying them visits. Among these were Elders Kington   Benbow Ockey Brewett Pitt and a number of   others whose names are familiar in my history 
 the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has deposited  with me his bond and security to my full satisfaction  according to the resolution of the Conference held in this  city on the 6th day of April 1843.    He therefore is recommend to all Saints and  honourable people as a legal agent to collect ^funds^ for the purpose  of building the Nauvoo House and Temple of the Lord.    Confident that he will honour this high  trust as well as ardently fulfill his commission as a  Messenger of Peace and Salvation as one of the Lord's  noble men I can fervently say, May the Lord clear  his way before him and bless him and bless those that  obey his teachings wherever there are ears to hear and  hearts to feel.    He is in the language of the Hebrews  "The friend of Israel" and worthy to be received and  entertained as a man of God. Yea he has (as  had the ancient Apostle) the Good Word that leadeth  unto Eternal Life    Wherefore brethren and friends while  you hear the assurance of the integrity fidelity and ability  of this servant of the Living God trusting that your hearts  and energies will be enlivened and deeply engaged in the  building of these houses directed by revelation for the  salvation of all Saints and that you will not rest where  you are until all things are prepared before you and  you are gathered home with the rest of Israel to meet  your God, I feel strong in the belief and have a growing  expectation that you will not withhold any means in   your power that can be used to accomplish this glorious  work.    Finally as one that greatly desires  the salvation of man let me remind you all to  strive with a Godly zeal for virtue holiness and the  commandments of the Lord. Be wise be just be  liberal and above all be charitable, always abounding  in all good works. And may health peace and 
 Thames and is the place from which Europeans and  Americans take their longitude    We walked from Greenwhich  to Woolwich also upon the banks of the Thames and  the most important naval and military post in England    There was at this time a small  church at Woolwhich numbering six members which  had been raised up by Elder Kimball. That evening  we met five of them at brother Bates and we  found the Woolwhich Saints though few firm  in the faith.    It was very cold the next day  and I spent the morning of the fire side of brother  Bates reading the Life and Death of the Reverend  John Fletcher but in the afternoon we took a view  of the town and its places of note and in spite of  the cold we had a most interesting time.    First we visited the Artillary  and Marine Barracks passed through and  had a view of their Drill and Parade ground    As cold as it was there were  a number of companies on parade and new recruits  under drill and one horse company exerssising. There  were many hundreds of cannon which we saw  and inspected one measuring 16 feet in length 3 1/2 in  diameter at the britch and 2 at the mouth    There were two soldiers being  burried at the time and with the usual military  display. We were present and saw them lowered  into the grave side by side. Then the chaplain read  the burial service and a company of soldiers fired  three rounds over their graves and retired. All  tended to make the view before us picturesque  though the latter scene gave a melancholy shade    We next visited the Dock and  Prison Yard. This is the largest and most interesting  Dock Yard in the world. 
 In the evening we walked to Brother Josephs and   spent several hours with him and Sister Emma and   had a very pleasant visit    Joseph had commenced this day   to proofread the Book of Mormon that it might   be sterotyped. He had read 60 pages. He   rehearsed over to us the Missouri transactions and   spoke of the death of David Patten and the request   which he made of him in his last dying   moments.    Two weeks later in the evening of   Sunday I met with the Twelve at Joseph's the Seers   and heard a discourse delivered by Heber C Kimball   He spake of the parable of Jeremiah concerning   the Potter and the clay. [##Jeremiah 18:1-6##] He said that when it was   marred in the hands of the potter it had to be thrown   asside to go into the next batch and was accounted   as a vessel of dishonour but that which formed well   and was pliable in the hands of the Potter became a   vessel of honour. So also he said it was with the   human ^family^ and their Creator. Joseph said that brother   Kimball had given the true explanation of the parable    After Sidney Roberts had further   occupied the meeting for a season Joseph the Seer   arose and read from the New Testament the parable   of the "Vine" and its "Branches" and explained it much   to our edification [##John 15:1-8##]    The Prophet observed during his remarks   that some said he was a fallen prophet because he   did not bring forth more of the word of the Lord   Why does he not do it? was their cry. We are able   to receive it!" But he said unto us—"No not one   in this room is prepared    In revelation he remarked "that a man   might command his son to do a thing and before he had   done it and with sufficient reason before he had done it  tell him to do something else and it was considered   right. But if the Lord gives a command and afterwards 
 and the love of God our Father and the grace of Jesus  Christ our Lord be and abide with you all is the  sincere prayer of    Your Devoted Brother & Friend  In the Everlasting Gospel  Joseph Smith    City of Nauvoo  June 1st 1843    On the 11th a large Assembly of Saints met at  the Temple and were addressed by the Prophet.  His subject was upon    The Gathering — Baptism for the Dead — ^The^ Spirits  in prison. the Different Glories and the Godhead    He took for the foundation of his discourse the  words of Jesus to the Jews—"How oft would I  have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her  chicken under her wings but ye would not" [##Matthew 23:37##]    From his discourse I culled some of  the points and noted them in my journal. He  asked—    "What was the object of gathering the  Jews or the people [blank] of God together in any age  of the world? The main object was to build  unto the Lord an House whereby he could reveal   unto His people the ordinances and glories of his  Kingdom and teach them the ways of salvation; for  there are certain ordinances and principles which  when they are taught and practised must be  done in a House or Temple built for that purpose    This was ordained in the mind of  God before the world was and it was for this purpose  that He designed oft to gather together the Jews but  they would not.    It is for the same reason that  God gathers together the people in the last days 
 On passing through the gate into the yard we recorded  our names and residences on a book and was then conducted  by Mr John Finsbury policeman to all parts of the yard  and saw all the branches of business carried on by government  there.    There are employed in this yard hundreds  of hands besides seven hundred prisoners. These were  engaged in building vessels steem boats ships of war making  anchors cables chains boilers cannon shot ^&c^ The fires or  bellows were all worked by steem and the operation of the  engines were pointed out to us.    Among many other curiousities we saw  the Hydrolic Press by which the strength of all the anchors  and cables are tested. With this small Press they can  readily break 150 tons weight and can snap an anchor  of five tons into pieces like a pipe stem    There were specimens of timber  which had been buried in the earth to see which  would stand the longest and it was found that the  English Oak stood the longest    We saw the boat in which Captian  Ross and his comrads were saved. Then we went  on to the upper deck of the new 120 gun ship Trafalgar  It had been upon the stocks a number of years but  was to be launched the following May. It was  considered as large as any ship then on the sea. He  also saw the convict ship    We left the Dock yard and went  to Bro Painter's house and had refreshments and then  we took the steam boat for London.    A letter from sister Young to Elder  Brigham Young informed us that the Prophet Joseph  was going to write for the Twelve to hold a Conference  in England in the Spring ordain as many as they  deemed wisdom and to ^send^ them to all parts where they  could and then for the Twelve to return to Nauvoo    In the weekly Despatch we read of the  wreck of the Packet Ship Garrick in which Elder Kimball and 
 revokes it and commands something else then the Prophet is   considered a fallen Prophet"    "Because the Church will not receive chastisment   from the hand of the Prophet and Apostles the Lord chastises   us with sickness and death."    "Let not any man publish his own righteousness   Others can do that for him. Rather let him confess his sins   and then he will be forgiven and bring forth more fruit."    "The reason why we do not have more of the   secrets of the Lord revealled unto us is because we do not keep even   our own secrets but reveal them and make our difficulties known   even to our enemies"    "What greater love hath any man than that   he lay down his life for his friends. [##John 15:13##] Then why not stand   by them unto death"    "These and many other matters Joseph   spoke and enlarged upon to our great edification    Elder Brigham Young arose and said that   one thing rested with weight upon his mind—namely that we   ought to be prepared to keep each commandment as it came   from the mouth of the Prophet and as the Lord had commanded   us to build a Temple we should do it speedily    Christmas Day    On Christmas day the Twelve took supper by invitation   at Mr Hyrum Kimballs. It was excellent sleighing   and I got horses and sleigh and carried the wives of the   Twelve to our host's and home again after our party broke   up.    Our company consisted of Brigham   Young Heber C Kimball Orson Pratt Willard Richards   John Taylor and myself and and our wives except Sister   Richards who was attending Sister Hyde    We had an excellent feast and before we   left Mr Kimball made each one of the Twelve a present  of a Lot of land and made out a bond for a deed to the whole   of the quorum. Each lot was worth 50 dollars making 
 to build unto Him an House to prepair them with ^for the^ ordinances  endowments washings anointings &c    One of the ordinances of the House of  the Lord is baptism for the dead. God decreed  before the foundation of the world that this ordinance  should be administered in an House prepared for that  purpose.    If a man obtains the fulness of the Gospel  he must get it in the same way that Jesus obtained it and  that was by keeping all the ordinances of the House of  the Lord    Men will say I will never forsake you  but will stand by you at all times yet the moment you  teach them some of the mysteries of God that are retained  in the heavens and are to be revealed to the children of  men when they are prepared that moment they will be the  first to stone you and put you to death. It was upon  the same principle and the same spirit which crucified  the Lord Jesus Christ"    I will say something about the Spirits  in Prison. There has been much said upon the words  of Jesus to the "Thief on the Cross" saying "This day thou  shalt be with me in Paradise [##Luke 23:43##]    The Comentators and Translators make  Jesus to say Paradise. But what is Par[adise]? It is  a modern word and does not answer at all to the original  which Jesus used. There is nothing in the original of any  language signifying Paradise. But it was "This day I will  be with thee in the world of Spirits" and will teach thee or  answer thy inquiries. The "Theif on the Cross" was to be  with Jesus Christ  in the world of Spirits. He did not say  Paradise or heaven.    The ^Refer^ doctrine of Baptism for the Dead  is clearly shown in the New Testament and if the doctrine  is not good then throw away the New Testament but if it  is the Word of God then let the doctrine be acknowledged  of God    It was one of the reasons why Jesus said to the 
 Hyde crossed the Atlantic twice.    On the 7th we baptized Mrs Susanna  M. Sangiovanni at which I took great satisfaction  for she was the daughter of David W. Rogers of  Montrose. She was married to an Italian who  was a very jealous man and an unbeleiver in the  Bible or any of the word of God and he would not  grant her any religious privileges. But this morning  she had come to be baptized and returned home rejoicing  with her whole heart. There was also one baptized  the day before.    This was Sunday and in the  afternoon we communed with the Saints experienced  a profitable time and had a full house and in  the evening Elder Kimball preached to a full  congregation and I followed him. The people paid  good attention and the Lord was with us greatly.    The Book of Mormon  Entered  At Stationers Hall.    We received on the 8th a package of 20 Books  of Mormon and two dozen Hymn Books and  Heber C Kimball and myself went to the Stationers  Hall and secured the copyright of the Book of  Mormon in the name Joseph Smith Jur. We   left five copies of the book and paid three shillings    In the evening we baptized  four persons one of whom was the wife of the Rev.  James Albon who had already received the Gospel    Elder Brigham Young per letter  informed us of the large imigration of that season  There were to go on one ship 235 and on another 100.    To the reader aquainted with the  immense emigrations of the Saints in later years  our consideration of the sailing of three or four  hundred as a large emigration will perchance at  ^be noteworth.^ 
 for the whole six hundred dollars. My Lot was   No 4 Block 10 in Kimballs addition to Nauvoo    Next day Joseph called upon me and   others of the Twelve to attend meeting at his house in   the evening. Many good principles were presented by   Joseph and Hyrum such as "Speak not in tongues   to your own nation but to those of another nation   and then it would condem the unbeleiver; for the Lord   does not work in vain. Joseph spoke much on   the 14. ch of 1 Cor. upon prophesies ceasing.    The following day the Twelve spent   with Joseph the Seer and he unfolded to them many   glorious things at the Kingdom of God the privileges   and blessings of the Pristhood &c. I had the   privilege for the first time of    Seeing the Urum Thummim    I spent the week as usual in my daily labours and   thus closed the year by my recording on the last   day in my Journal a synopsis of my travels &   labours in the ministry during 1841    Synopsis   of   The Travels and Labours  of   Willford Woodruff in 1841.    Towns & Cities visited during the year.    In England and Wales:    London Bristol Liverpool Preston Manchester  Staffordshire Potteries Wolverhampton Birmingham  Worcester Hereford Ledbury Malvern Hills 
 the first sight seem a small notion. But this was in   the early rise of the European Mission and moreover in 1840 the  doctrine of emigration from father land among the English  was repugnant. Emigration had not then as now become an  institution of modern times. Out of this Church it was  considered among the peasantry and manifacturing classes  of England as a calamity and was never accepted by them  from choice. Not until misfortune panics in trade  or dire necessity came did they accept emigration from  father-land    At this time then came the Latter  day Saint Apostles and elders preaching to country  loving Englishman the doctrine of emigration from their  native land — and preaching the doctrine chiefly to those  who mostly perhaps had not seen a score of miles of the  great world outside their village, homes. Well might  we then in 1840 consider the emigration of four  hundred Saints as a large matter.    Elder Kimball and myself at this time  prepared a tract for the press to present to the citizens  of London before we left the first principles of the  Gospel and commission given by Jesus to his ancient  Apostles.    Elder Lorenzo Snow arrived  in London on the 11th to take charge of the church  after our departure. I was truly glad to once more  greet him for I had not seen him since 1837    On the same day Elder Wm Pitt  also arrived at our lodgings and we had an interesting  meeting in the evening. Brother Snow preached  and Elder Kimball and myself followed him and  the next ^day^ brothers Heber and Lorenzo went to  Woolwich to give impetous to the work of God  in that important town.    There was great excitement at that  time both in the House of Parliament and throughout  England in consequence of the apprehension and  imprisonment of Mr  M. C. Cleod a British officer 
 Gloucester Cheltenham Oxford Woolwich & Monmouth.    In America:    New York, Portland Boston Hartford and   New Haven Albany Buffaloo Detroit Mackinau Chicago   and Nauvoo.    Besides these I visited a vast number of smaller   towns and places lying between the foregoing both in England   and America.    Miles Travelled 7062.    Meetings Held 83.

 be stuffed ^put^ into one person they would make a great God. If  I were to testify that the world was wrong on this point  it would be true. Peter says that Jesus sat on the right  hand of God [##1 Peter 3:22##] and any person who has seen the heavens  opened knows that there are three personages in the Heavens  holding the Keys of power    "As the Father hath power in himself  so also hath the Son power in himself". Then the Father  has at some time laid down his body and taken it again  so he has a body of his own. So has also his son.    Many of the Sects cry out I have the  testimony of Jesus. I have the Spirit of God; but away  with Jo Smith. He says he is a Prophet but there is to  be no Prophets nor revelations in the last days. But  stop Sirs. The Revelator says, "the testimony of Jesus  is the spirit of prophecy," [##Revelation 19:10##] So by your own mouth you  are condemned    But to the text. Why gather the people  together in this place? For the same reason that Jesus  wanted to gather the Jews to receive the ordinances the  blessings and the glories that God has in store for his  Saints.    And I will now ^here^ ask this Assembly and  all the Saints if they will now build this house and  receive the ordinances and blessings which God has in  store for you or will you not build unto the Lord  this House and let Him pass by and bestow these  blessings upon another. I pause for a reply.    About this time in company with several others  I started to fence and plant a five acre lot of prairie  We had not got far before the reach of our wagon  broke and we were all thrown into a pile together  and the wheel went on my arm and bruised it  considerably. But we mended up and continued 
 in Lockport Jail by the State of New York which was  trying him for arson and murder, and the Americans  were determined to execute him if found guilty.    The accusation was the burning of  the Caroline on Lake Erie in 1834 during the troubles  in Canada. England considered it a national and  not an individual affair and that M. C. Cleod acted  by order of the British Government and not upon his  own responsibility. Under these considerations  Parliament was determined to demand his release   and defend his life even at the expence of immediate  war with America. Government had sent a   special message and instructions to the British  ambassador at Washington. These threatenings  of war between England and America made   us anxious concerning our return to our country  and the emigration of the Saints to the body  of the Church.    From what I had seen of  England of one thing I felt certain and that was  that if America hazards a war with England  she would find it to be more than a joke to  meet so strong a foe and one armed to the teeth  for war. Upon the subject I thought and  wrote in my daily journal:    "Should Truth speak she would  represent England at the present time as the strongest  among the nations and chief in power and main spring  of the Gentile world. She will remain her season  as an instrument in the hand of God to bring  about great events, in the restoration of the Jews and  to be a scourge to the nations America not excepted  but she will also receive the scourage and the chastening  hand of the Almighty will fall upon her in turn  But O! America, America! ^whose had is^ choice above all other  lands and ^thou^ established by omnipotant Power! thy  salt hath lost it savour thy light hath gone  out and thine Eagle's crest is stained with the blood 
 Jan 1842    Chapter XIX    New Year's day 1842 found me in   the city of Nauvoo with the quorum of the Twelve and   our wives spending the day at the house of brother   Stodard.    It was an interesting occassion for   us to meet together with our families at a festive   time in the city of the Saints in the midst of peace   and love. We could the more highly prize this privilege   as we were so often called to be seperated in the vineyard   of the Lord    It was now my privilege and lot to   tarry for a season at home, and to provide for my family   This was the first time since I had been in the Church   that I had been thus privileged as I had been on missions most   of the time for eight years    As we had now the commandment   of the Lord to build the Temple and the Nauvoo   house resting upon us the probability was that the Quorum   of the Twelve would spend most of the time in Nauvoo   until the Temple was built.    On the 10th of the month I sold to   brother John Horlick the South half of my lot and bought   two lots of Hyrum Kimball for $250 fifty of which   I paid him down in cloth and a watch and the other 
 to the prairie and made 82 rods of worm fence with  stakes and riders. Just before I left I went to brother  Cheney to get a drink of water and his dog bit me  very badly through the calf of my leg. He was  an ugly dog and had bit several persons before  I was very lame for some days and the next time  I went to my lot I informed Brother Cheney that  I should not be satisfied unless he killed his dog  as he was dangerous and in the habit of biting  persons    Judge Adams of Springfield wrote  informing us that the Governor of Missouri  had made another demand for Joseph at the   hands of the Governor of Illinois and that Ford  of Illinois had issued the writ for his apprehension.    Two messengers were immediately  despatched from Nauvoo to President Joseph  Smith, who was absent & ^about^ 200 miles from home  at the time, informing him of these facts.    This was on the Sunday. and  The Sabath following being ^day^ June 25th in the afternoon  Hyrum came into the Stand and requested the  Masonic Fraternity to meet him in the Lodge Room  in a half an hour. We immediately went down  but a quarter of us could not get into the room    This being the case We formed  a hollow square on the green. Hyrum then  informed us that the Sheriff of Jackson Co. Missouri  and Wilson of Carthage had come upon Joseph  and taken him by surprise presenting each of  them a pistol to his breast and swaring they  would kill him if he made any resistance    Brother Markham went to his  assistance and they presented pistols to him  also and threatened his life. He approached  them however to knock down the pistols when  they again pointed them at Joseph's breast 
 was to be paid in two annual payments; and a week or two   afterwards I purchased a house and an acre of land of brother   Parsons to be paid for on the 20th of the following April    Several days later I rode to Brother   Benbows on the Prar^i^rie six miles from Nauvoo and it being   Sunday I preached at his house    This was the first time that I had visited   him since my return to Nauvoo. I spent the time very   pleasantly while there. His farm looked almost like the   Garden of Eden. I never had seen more work done in one   year on a prar^i^rie farm than on his. He had surrounded   it and crossed it with heavy ditches and planted thorn hedges   His dwelling barns sheds garden yards orchards &c were all   beautifully arranged. Indeed Brother Benbow's farm much   resembled the farms of old England where as the reader has   learned he held the position of a respectable well-to-do-farmer,  who cultivated about 300 acres of land    This place was a pleasant retreat for a   Summers ride from Nauvoo. The little neighbourhood   consisted of five families from England and all well united   excepting one family who had denyed the faith.    Before my return to the city on the   following day I paid to brother John Benbow 200 dollars   for President Joseph Smith and endorsed it on his note    I assisted in drawing up from the river   two large stones to the Nauvoo house for the threshholds   of the doors    A few days previous a revelation   was given for the Twelve to obtain the printing establishment   of E. Robinson and govern the printing of the Times &   Seasons and all the publication of the Church as directed by   the Holy Ghost    After consulting upon the subject the   quorum of the Twelve appointed Elders John Taylor and   Willford Woodruff to take charge of the whole establishment   and edit the Times and Seasons under the direction   of Joesph the Seer    Accordingly on the 3rd of February 3rd I 
 and said they would kill him if Markham approached  them. So to save Joseph's life Markham forbare  and they then took Joseph into Carthage and started for  Missouri    They had gone about ten miles when they  were stoped by the inhabitants of the country who  swore they should not carry Joseph Smith any farther  without giving him a chance of the law and they  took out a writ of Habeas Corpus in behalf of Joseph and  a writ against Sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson and they  now wanted a company to go to Joseph to see that he  had his rights    Brother Hyrum called for volunteers  and the whole city flocked together. They made choice  of such as they wished and Generals Law and  Rich went with about one hundred men on horseback  and somewhere near the same on board the Maid  of Iowa. The horsemen left the city at about  8 o'clock that night but the boat did not start  until the next morning.    Triumphal Entry of the Prophet  to  The City of Nauvoo    Five days afterwards at 1 o'clock in the afternoon  the citizens of Nauvoo, went out in great numbers  on foot horseback and in carriages to meet the Prophet  and when they did meet him there was a scene  of great joy    A band of music and a great  multitude escorted him to his home and Reynolds  of Missouri and Wilson of Carthage who had taken   him by force of arms were brought to Nauvoo  with ^him^ and they looked as though they had the ague  Yet Joseph heaped coals of fire upon their heads who  had so inhumanly treated him by taking them to 
 left my station at the Nauvoo Provision Store and commenced   to labour for the Church in the Printing Establishment. Elder   Taylor and myself spent the afternoon in taking an invoice   of the Printing Office which we finished the next day and met   at Joseph's Store and E Robinson made out the deed to Willard  Richards of his lot and house containing the Printing establishment   and all appurtenances belonging thereto amounting in   all to $6,600.    The following day I assisted Willard Richards   in taking in the tithing for the ^Temple^ amounting to about   1000 dollars worth of property    About two weeks later Joseph the Seer   presented us with some of the Book of Abraham written   by the hand of that Patriarch and which was found   in Egypt and ^which^ with some mummies came into the   hands of the Prophet several years before. He was   now translating them to publish portions of it in   the Times and Seasons of which paper he was the   Editor and John Taylor his assistant while the business   part of the establishment was under my charge    I had been much edified of late in   hearing Joseph converse upon the mystries of the Kingdom   of God. "Truly," I thought, "the Lord is with him and   making him mighty in Knowledge and wisdom" and I was   convinced that none of the Prophets or Seers have ever accomplished   a greater work than the Lord will bring to pass in the last   days through the instrumentality of Joseph    On My birthday ^March 1st^ came and I made a feast   for my friends and four days afterwards, on the 4th of   March in the morning, 30 minutes past 10 ^o'clock^ a.m. my daughter   Phebe A. Woodruff was born    A week later the Nauvoo Legion met   on parade and in company with the Twelve I rode in the   Legion as assistant Chaplain. This was the first time I   had seen the Legion on parade    On the 15th of the ^same^ month the Nauvoo   Masonic Lodge was established and organized. The   procession was found at half past one oclock at Joseph's 
 his house setting them at the head of his table and  causing the best his house afforded to be served to them  by his wife—the very woman they had refused to  see her husband when they forced him with the  threatening of arms and ruffian oaths    After dinner they all repaired  to the court Room and Joseph was delivered into the  hands of the Municipal Court for trial    Before he went into court Joseph  mounted a wagon and said to the multitude—    "I am out of the hands of the Missourians  thank God!"    He thanked them for their kindness and  love to him and said that he would address them at  the grove near the Temple at 4 o'clock    After the case was introduced to the  Court Joseph informed it that he had an appointment  to address the citizens and ask^ed^ the privilege. The  court extended the courtesy to him and he went ^the^  ^court^ adjourned until the next morning    After the adjournment of his case  Joseph went to the Grove and took the Stand  in the presence of an assembly of about seven  thousand Saints ^to whom he narrated the incidents of  his arrest and maintaind the prowers of the Charter of Nauvoo for  the protection of its citizens.^    Epitome  of  the  Speech of Joseph  To the Citizens of Nauvoo  June 30th 1843    I require attention.

 Store and marched to the grove in front of the Temple where the   [FIGURE] Lodge was organized and an address delivered by the Grand Master   of the Masonic Lodge of Illinois. There were about three thousand   assembled on the occasion [FIGURE]    On Sunday March the 20th a large assembly   gathered at an early hour to hear a discourse from Joseph   upon the subject of baptism, but as a young child wsa dead   and his corps brougt in the assembly it called forth many   remarks upon death and the resurrection. I reported and recorded   in my Journal    A Brief Synopsis   of the   Sermon of Joseph the Prophet    The speaker read the 14 ch of Revelations and said:    "We have again the warning voice Sounded in our midst   "which shows the uncertainty of human life. And in my   "leasure moments I have meditated upon the subject and   asked the question, Why is it that inocent children are taken  away from us especially those who seem to be the most   intelligent beings?"    The Answer: [FIGURE]    "This world is a very wicked world and it is   a proverb that it grows weaker and wiser, but if this is the   case it is also true that the world grows more wicked and   corrupt    "In the early ages of the world a righteous   man—a man of God and intelligence had a better chance   to do good, to be received and beleived than at the present   day. In these days such a man is much opposed   and persecuted by most of the inhabitants of the earth   and he has much sorrow to pass through. Hence the   Lord takes many away even in infancy that they may escape   the envy of man and the sorrows and evils of the present   ^and they were too true and too lovely to live on earth^ world. Therefore I rightly considered instead of mourning   we have reason to rejoice as they are delivered from the   evil and we shall soon have them again. 
 gratitude to Almighty God and I presume you all feel the  same.    I hardly know how to express my feelings.  I feel as strong as a giant. I pulled sticks with the  men coming along and with one hand I pulled up  the strongest man there was on the road with one  hand and two could not pull me up; and I continued  to pull until I pulled them to Nauvoo. But I will  pass from that subject.    There has been great excitement in  the country but since those men took me I have  been cool and dispassionate through the whole.    Thank God I am now in the hands  of the Municipal Court of Nauvoo and not in the hands  of Missourians.    It has been discussed by the great  and wise men—lawyers and thereir like: Oh your  powers and legal tribunals are not to be sanctioned  and so we will make it lawful to drag away inocent  men from their families and friends and have them  unlawfully put to death by ungodly men for their  religion.    Relative to our charter, courts, right  of Habeaus Corpus &c we have all power; and if  any man from this time fourth says anything  contrary cast it into his teeth    There is a secret in this. If there  is not power in our charter and courts then there  is not power in the State of Illinois nor in the  Congress nor Constitution of the United States; for  the United States gave unto Illinois her constitution  and charter; and Illionois gave unto Nauvoo her  charter which have ceded unto us our vested  rights and she has no right nor power to take  them from us. All the power there was in  Illinois she gave to Nauvoo and any man who  says to the contrary is a fool    I want you to teach ^learn^, O! Israel, what 
 "What chance is there for infidelity when we are   "parting from our friends daily? There is none at all.   "The infidel will grasp at every straw for help until   "death stares him in the face and then his infidelity takes   "its flight; for the realities of the eternal world are   "resting in mighty power upon him. When every earthly   "support and prop fails him he then sensibly feels the   "eternal truths of the immortality of the soul.    "Concerning the doctrine of baptizing or sprinkling   "children or they must welter in hell the doctrine is   "not true nor supported in Holy Writ and it is not   "consistant with the character of God"    "The moment children leave this world   "they are taken into Abraham's bosom. The only   difference between the old and young dying is that   one lives longer in heaven and eternal light and glory   them the other and was freed a little sooner from   this misserable wicked world. Notwithstanding   all this glory we for a moment loose sight of it   and mourn the loss but we mourn not as those   without hope."    We should take warning and not   wait for the death bed to repent. As we see the   infant taken away by death so may the youth and   middle aged as well be called suddenly into eternity   Let this then prove as a warning to all not to   procrastinate repentance nor wait till a death bed comes   for it is the will of God that man should repent and   serve Him in health and strength and in the power of   his mind in order to secure his blessing and ^not^ to wait   until he is called to die."    "My intention was to have treated   upon the subject of baptism; but having a case of   death before us I thought it proper to refer to that   subject. I will now however say a few words upon   baptism as designed.    "God has made certain decrees which 
 what is for the happiness and peace of this city and  people for our enemies are determined to oppress us  and deprive us of our rights and privileges as they  have done; If the authorities that be on the  earth will not assist us in our rights nor give  us that protection which the laws and constitution  of the United States and of this State guarantee  unto us then we will claim them from Higher  Power—from Heaven—from God Almighty for  our constitutional rights    I swear I will not deal so mildly  with them again for the time has come when  forbearance is no longer a virtue; and if you are  again taken unlawfully you are at liberty to give  loose to blood and thunder but act with  Almighty power    But good luck to me as it  always has been in every time of trouble, friends  though they were strangers were raise up ^un^to me  and assisted me. The time has come when  the veil is torn off the people of the State of Illinois  and they have delivered me from the State of  Missouri. The friends who were raised up  unto me would have spilt their blood for me  to have delivered me then and there but I told  them not for I should be delivered by the power  of God and Generalship    I have brought the men who  arrested me to Nauvoo and treated them kindly. I  have had the privilege of rewarding them good for  evil. They took me unlawfully, treated me rigorously,  strove to deprive me of my rights and would have  run me into Missouri to have been murdered  had not Providence interposed; but now they  are in my hands. I took them into my house  set them at the head of the table and placed the  best before them my house afforded and they were  waited upon by my wife whom they deprived of 
 seeing me when I was taken    I shall be discharged before ^by the^ Municipal  Court of Nauvoo. Wh[blank space] I before any good tribunal  I should be discharged; but before I will bear this un-  hallowed persecution any longer I will spill my blood  There is a time when bearing it any longer is a sin.  I will not bear it longer. I will spill the last drop  of blood I have; and all who will not bear it  longer say, Aye! -[The cry of Aye rung throughout  the congregation]-    "We must stop paying the lawyers  money; for I have learned that they dont know  anything. I know more than they all.    Whosover beleiveth that there is  power in the charter of Nauvoo shall be saved:  he that beleiveth not shall not come here.    If a lawyer shall say there  is more power in other places and charters than  in Nauvoo beleive it not.    ^I supose^ I have converted this candidate   for congress, Mr. Walker. I suppose When I  see him converted I shall vote for him; and  not before. I have been with these lawyers and  they have treated me well; but I am here in  Nauvoo and ^the Missourian too^    However you may feel about the high  hand of oppression I wish you to restrain your hand  from violence against those men who arrested  me. My word is at stake. A hair of their  heads shall not be harmed    My life is pledged to carry out  this great work. I know how readily you are to  do right. You have done great things and manifested  your love in flying to my assistance on this occasion.  I could not have done better myself; and I bless  you in the name of the Lord with all the blessings 
 May you not have to suffer as you have suffered  heretofore. I know the Almighty will bless  all good men. He will bless you; and the time  has come when there shall be such a flocking  to the Standard of Liberty as never has been and  never shall be hereafter. What an era has  commenced? Shall the prophecies be established  by the sword? Shall we always bear? No!  Will not the State of Missouri stay her hand  in her unhallowed persecutions against the Saints?  If she will not I restrain you not any longer.    I say in the name of Jesus  Christ I this day turn the key that opens the  Heavens to restrain you no longer from this time  forth. I will lead you to battle and if you are  not affraid to die and feel disposed to spill your  blood in your own defence you will not offend me    Be not the aggressor. Bear until  they strike on the one cheek. Offer the other and  they will be sure to strike that also. Then defend  yourself and God shall bear you off!    Will any part of Illinois say we  shall not have our rights? Treat such as strangers  and not friends and let them go to hell. Say some,  we will mob you. Mob and be damned. If  I am under the necessity of giving up our chartered  rights privileges and freedom for which our fathers  fought and blead and which the Constitution of the  United States and this State guarantee to us I  will do it at the point of the bayonet and sword    Many lawyers contend for that  which is against the rights of man; and I can  only excuse them because of their ignorance.    Go forth and advocate the rights of  the people ye lawyers. If you do not dont  get into my hands nor under the lash of my  tongue. The lawyers say the powers of  the Nauvoo Charter are dangerous. But I 
 ask is the constitution of the United State or if this State   dangerous? No. Neither are the charters granted   unto Nauvoo by the Legislature of Illinois and those   who say they are, are fools.    We have not our rights. Those which   the Constitution of the United States grant and which   our charters grant we have not enjoyed unmolested.  Missouri and all wicked men will raise the Hue   and cry against us and are not satisfied. But what   are they going to do to help them selves? What will   mobocrats do in the midst of this people. If mobs   come upon you any more here dung your gardens   with them. But says one you will get up excitement.   We will get up no excitement except what we can   find an escape from. We will rise up Washington-  like and break off the wheight which bears us down   and we will not be mobbed.    To give you an account of my journey   I will tell you an anecdote which may be pleasing    A day before I was taken I rode   with my wife through a neighbourhood to visit some   friends; and I said to Mrs Smith, "Here are a   good people". I felt this by the Spirit of God.   The next day I was in their hands ^midst^ a prisoner ^and^   with^they stood by me^ Wilson who said as he drove up, "Ha! ha! ha!  By God we have got the Prophet!" He gloried   much in it but he is now our prisoner.    When Reynolds of Missouri and   Wilson of Carthage came to take me ^instead^   ^of tapping^ me on the shoulder and saying   "You are my prisoner" with two cocked pistols at   my head their first salutation was "God damn   you I will shoot you! I will shoot you. God   damn you I will shoot you!"    This they did nearly fifty ^times^ first   and at last, I asked them what the wanted to shoot   me for. 
 "If you make any resistance."    "Oh! very well said I. I have no resistance   to make."    They then draged me away; and while   on the road I asked them by what authority they did   they these things:    They said, "By a writ from the   Government of Missouri and Illinois"    I then told them I wanted a Writ of Habaeus   Corpus. The reply was,    "God damn you! You shant have it."    I told a man to go to Dixon and   get me a Writ of Habaeus Corpus. Wilson answered    "God damn you! You sha[n]t have it. I   will shoot you!"    I sent for a lawyer to come. One   came; and Reynolds shut the door in his face and   would not let me speak to him and said again   "God damn you! I will shoot you!"    I turned to him opened my bosom   and told him to shoot away and I did ^it^ frequently.    I told Mr Reynolds that I would   have council to speak to; and the lawyers came   to me and I got a Writ of Habaeus Corpus for   myself and a writ against Wilson and Reynolds   for unlawful proceedings towards me and cruel   treatment.    They could not get out of town that   night. I pledged my honour to my council that the   Nauvoo Charter had power to investigate the subject   and we came to Nauvoo by common consent and I am   now a prisoner of higher authority. Yes higher authority:   before yourselves    The Charter expressly say that   the City Council shall have power to enact all laws   for the benefit and convenience of said city not   contrary to the constitutions of the United States   and that of this State; and also says the Municipal 
 Court shall have power to grant Writ of Habeaus Corpus   in all cases arising under the ordinances of the city council    There is nothing but what we have   power over except ^that^ restricted by the Constitution of the   United States or of this State. This is in accordance   with the Constitution of the United States    But says the mob "What dangerous powers!"    But the Constitution of the United States is not   dangerous against good men neither is that of this State.  but to bad men—the breakers of the law    As with the laws of the country so   with the ordinances of Nauvoo. They are dangerous to   mobs but not to good men who wish to keep the law    We do not go out of Nauvoo to disturb   anybody nor any city town or place. Why need they   be troubled about us? Let them not meddle with our   affairs but let us alone.    After we have been deprived of our   rights and privileges as citisens—driven from town to   town place to place and State to State, with the   sacrifice of our homes and lands—our blood shed   and many murdered and all this because of our   religion—because we worship Almighty God according   to the dictates of our own conscience, shall we   longer bear these cruelties which have been heaped   upon us for the last ten years in the face of   heaven and in open violation of the Constitution and   laws of the United State and of this State?  May God forbid! I will not bear it. If they   take away my rights I will fight for my rights   I will fight for my rights manfully until I am   used up with blood and thunder sword and pistol.    We have done nothing against law  and right.    As touching our City Charter and laws   there is a secret. What is it? Our laws go behind   the writ and investigate the subject i.e. ^that is to say^ of Habeaus   Corpus while other laws do not go behind the writ    You speak of lawyers. I am a 
 too; but the Almighty God has taught me the principle   of law; and the true meaning of the Writ of Habeaus   Corpus is to defend the inocent and investigate the subject—  go behind the writ and even if the form of the writ   should be right but issued against an inocent man   he should not be dragged to another State and there   put to death or in jeap[ardy] of life or limb because of  prejudice when he is inocent.    The benefits of the Constitution and   law is for all alike and the great Eloihiem or God has given   me the privilege of having the benefits of anf the Constitution   and writ of Habeaus Corpus. I am bold to ask   for this privilege this day and to ask you to carry   out this principle and all who are in favour of this   great principle make it manifest by raising the   right hand."    -[The^re^ was a perfect sea of hands—a   universal vote. It was truly a committee of the   whole. After this strong demonstration of the feelings   of the vast multitude present Joseph continued]-    "In speaking of my journey to   Nauvoo I will relate a circumstance.    "When Mr Cyrus Walker came   to me they said I should not speak to any man   and they would shoot any man who should speak   to me. An old man came up and said I   should have council and said ^told them^ he was not affraid of   their pistols. I was delivered from them    [five lines blank]    My freedom commenced from the time the   old man came to me and would talk to me. We   came direct from Papa Grove to Nauvoo. Our writ   was directed to the nearest court having authority to   try the case and we came to Nauvoo 
 It did my soul good to see your feelings and love manifested   towards me. I thank God that I have the honour to lead   so virtuous and honest a people—to be your leader and   lawyer^er^ ^giver^ as Moses was to the children of Israel. Hosannah!   Hosannah! Hosannah to the name of the Most High   God. I commend you to His grace and may the   blessings of heaven rest upon you in the name of Jesus   Christ, Amen.    Furthermore if Missouri continues her   warfare and continues to issue writs against me and   this people unlawfully and unjustly as they  ^it^ have ^has^ done   and our rights are trampled upon and taken away   I sware with uplifted hands towards heaven I   will spill my blood in the defence. They shall not   take away our rights and if the^y^ do not stop leading   me by the nose I will lead them by the nose and   if they do not let me alone I will turn up the   world. I will make war! When we shake   our own bushes we want to catch our own fruit    The lawyers themselves acknowledge   that we have all power granted us in our charters   that we could ask for—that we had more power   than any other court in the State for all other   courts were restricted while ours was not and   I thank God Almighty for it and I will not   be rode down to hell by the Missourians any   longer and it is my privilege to speak   in my own defence and appeal to your   Honors.    Next day July the 1st the case of   Joseph Smith came before the Municipal   Court of Nauvoo. Brigham Young Hyrum   Smith Parley P. Pratt Lyman Wight and   Sidney Rigdon were called upon as witnesses 
 and duly sworn.    The testimony of these witnesses occupied   nearly the entire day. They recountered the whole history   of the persecution from Jackson County to the time of   their expulsion from the State of Missouri by force of   arms.    It was heart-rending to hear the rehersal   Never was gthere given to any tribunal a history of   barbarities and religious persecution more disgraceful   to civilization for it was in the Nineteenth century   and in America. Yet that tribunal heard that   day a history of persecution in many atrocious forms   among which were the scenes of prisons chains rape   murder and expulsion and heard the horrible fact   that when Joseph and his companions were in prison   loaded with chains they were fed with nothing for  five days in succession but the flesh of their own   ^murdered^ Brethren which was actually cooked and given   them to eat. This horrible fact they afterwards   discovered from the exultation of the monsters who   who the cause of this fiendish circumstance.    While hearing this part of   the testimony my blood boiled within me and the   spirit of war was aroused. The Gentile Lawyers   who had the management of the case were shocked   to the soul and Mr Wallker and the three other   legal gentlemen each made a speech councselling   us to stand for our rights at any issue.    The 4th of July was a great and   happy day with us in Nauvoo. Joseph had just   been again delivered from the hands of Missouri   and it was also the day of our National Indipendence    At a very early hour people began   to assemble at the Grove and at eleven o'clock there were   congregated something near the number of 13,000 persons   and the constant accession of others swelled the   congregation to fifteen thousand persons as near as   could be estimated 
 In the forenoon this vast multitude was addressed   by Orson Hyde who had lately returned from Palestine and   ^who^ was now under a new appointment, to go on a mission to   St Petersburgh Russia.    In the afternoon three steamers arrived   one from St Louis one from Quincy and the other from   Burlington bringing altogether about nine hundred visiting   ladies and gentlemen to our city.    On the arrival of each boat the visitors   were escorted to the Stand by the Nauvoo Band where   they were welcomed by the firing of cannon and provided   with seats.    During the afternoon Parley P. Pratt  gave a masterly discourse and Joseph followed him   upon the subject of his arrest &c    Synopsis  of  The Defence of Joseph  Before Fifeteen Thousand People.    If the people will give ear a moment I will   address them a few words in my own defence as   touching my arrest    In the first place I will state to   those who can hear me that I never spent more than   six months in Missouri except while in prison   While I was there I was at work for the support of   my family. I never was a prisoner of war   during my stay there for I had not made war. I   never took a pistol a gun or a sword and the much   which has been said upon the subject is false   I have been willing to go before any Governor Judge   or Tribunal where justice could be done and have the   subject investigated. I could not have committed 
 treason in that State while there. I had no controle   anywhere there in temporal things but in spiritual   I was driven from that State by force of arms   under the exterminating order of Governor Boggs    I never committed treason, the people   know very well. I have been a peaceable   citizen but there has been a great hue and cry   about Governor Boggs being shot. No crime   can be done but what it is laid to Jo. Smith   Here I was again dragged to the United States   Court and was cleared and now it comes again   But As often as God sees fit for me to suffer   I am ready; but I am as inocent of these   crimes as the angels in heaven. I am not   an enemy to mankind. I am a friend   to mankind. I am not an enemy to   Missouri nor to any Governors or people.    As to the military station I   hold and the cause of my holding it, it is   thus:    When we came here the State required   us to bear arms and do military duty according   to law; and as the Church had just been   driven from Missouri and robbed of all their   property and arms they were poor, and   destitute of arms. They were liable to be   fined for not doing duty when they had no   arms to do it with. They came to me for   advice. I advised them to organize themselves   into indipendant companies and demand arms   of the State. This they did. Again there   were many Elders having licence to preach which   by law ex^onorate^ them from military duty   but the officers would not release them on   this ground. I then told the Saints that   though I was clear of military duty by law   in consequence of lameness in one of my   legs yet I would set them the example 
 and do duty myself. They then said they were willing   to do duty if they could be formed into an indipendant   company and I could be at their head. Upon this   ground came the Nauvoo Legion and I holding the   office of Lieutenant General. Not that I seek for   power.    And with regard to elections. Some   say we all vote together and vote as I say; but I   never tell my man how to vote nor who to vote   for. But I will show you how we have been   situated by bringing a comparison:    ^Supposing there^ Should there be a Methodist  Society here and two candidates running for office;  one says if you will vote for me and put me in   Governor I will exterminate the Methodists and   take away their charters &c. The other says   if I am Governor I will give all an equal privilege.  Which would the Methodist vote for? Of course   they would vote in mass for the candidate who   would give them their rights    Thus it has been with us. Joseph   Duncan said if the people would elect him he would   exterminate the Mormons and take away their   charters. As to Mr Ford he made no such threats  but manifested a spirit in his speeches to give   every man his rights. Hence the Church universally   voted for Mr Ford and he was elected Governor   But he has issued writs against me the first time   the Missourians made the demand and this is   the second one he has issued for me which has   caused me much trouble and expence."    Joseph also rehearsed the account of   his being taken by Reynolds and Wilson and   the unlawful treatment he received at their   hands. The multitude gave good attention   and much prejudice seemed to be removed 
 ^Chapter XXI^  [top of page blank]  I arose early on the morning of ^the^ 7th of   July laid hands upon Mrs Woodruff and blessed   her and our daughter Phebe Amelia and started   on my mission.    On the afternoon of the same  day we left Morrisons Landing on the steam-  boat Rapids. Elders Brigham Young G. A Smith  and myself were together of the Twelve. E. P. Magin  was also in our company. We arrived in St   Louis the next day.    I called at Mr Philips Paper   Warehouse and made purchaces for Taylor and   Woodruff of the "Times and Seasons" office and   shiped it for Nauvoo    Next day We left on the "Lancet" bound   for Cincinnati where we arrived on the 13th   We had a view of President Harrison's Toomb  on our way    Elder Smith was quite ^sick^ throughout   the night of our arrival. I dreamt that Joseph 
 was again taken with another writ and was to be tried in   Illinois. On this night Brigham Young also dreamt that   we were called home.    At Cincinnati I shipped 30 reams of   paper for the Times and Seasons and we spent the interval   to the 22nd in visiting the Saints and Branches near; and then  left for Pittsburg on board the Adelade for Pittsburg where   we arrived on the 27th at 6 o'clock p.m.    There was a meeting that night in the   city at the Temperance Hall to which we repaired and   about the first persons we saw were Elders H. C Kimball  and Orson Pratt. We heard the voice of John E. Page   preaching as we entered. He hammered the sects  during his discourse and at the close he informed the   people of our arrival which made six of the ^Twelve^ in the   city.    Next day our quorum held a council   and Brigham its president enquired concerning the   proceedings of the Twelve at Cincinnati, and found   that elders Kimball O. Pratt and John E. Page held   a conference and organized the Church there and   their Elders Pratt and Kimball left for Pittsburgh   but Elder Page stayed behind & in a few days   disunited what he been done and reorganized the   Church    President Young reproved John E. Page   for undoing what three of the quorum of the Twelve   had done together and spoke also of Joseph's counsel  to be gentle and mild in our teachings and not   to battle with the sects but win the affections   of the people.    Pittsburgh resembled the English   cities in consequence of the burning of so much   stone coal which covered the ^city with the^ the dustiness of the smoke  Its population was about 35,000 it had 120 preachers  95 churches and 21 denominations and the Branch  the Branch of the Church of Latter-day Saints numbered   seventy-five souls. 
 Sunday the 30th six of the quorum of the Twelve   met at Temperance Hall in Pittsburgh with the Saints  In the morning I addressed the meeting followed by   G. A Smith; in the afternoon John E. Page and Orson  Pratt, and in the evening H. C. Kimball followed   by Brigham Young.    Items  from  Brigham Young's Remarks    Among many other things he said    "Why do the people oppose the gifts and graces?  If a man can get faith by the power of God and   the gift of the Holy Ghost so as to lay hands   upon his wife and children or friends when   they lie sick and languishing nigh unto   death and command the fever or disease or   even death itself to depart and the person is   releived I ask what harm is there in all this?  Or if a man by faith and humility before   God can get the testimony of Jesus and prophesy   of things to come or speak in tongues or cast   out devils I ask what harm in all this?  Does it do any harm? No it does not.    I know the New Testament   is true; for I have proved it according to   the pattern given by beleiving in Christ   obeying the Gospel and knowing the signs   do follow. Then I ask do these things  harm any one? No they do not."    In speaking of the Kingdom of   God he said    "The Kingdom must be   together; the people must be gathered into 
 one place. For how would the King of France or England  succeed in undertaking to reign over a Kingdom when the   people were scattered all over the world except in France  or England. They could not reign over a people unless   the people were with those kings to reign over    So with the Saints. They must be   gathered together and this work has already commenced   And who is the author of this work and gathering?  Joseph Smith the Prophet as an instrument in the   hands of God is the Author of it. He is the greatest  man on earth. No other man of this age has   power to assemble such a great people from all the   nations of the earth with all their varied dispositions  and assimulate them and cement them together  so that they might be subject to rule and order   This the Prophet is doing; and that which makes   a great king president or man is to have a great   people to rule over."    Next day our quorum assembled and took   a tour through the city. We visited Curling's  Glass Works and saw them work through each   branch of the manufacture; we then went to the   bluff above the city and had a view of the new   Basin to be filled with water forced from the   Alleghaney River to supply the city below of   which we had a fair view.    Descending the hill we had a   view of the city water works. The building was   after the Roman order cost two hundred thousand dollars   and was designed and executed by Elder Charles Beck  a member of the Church of Latter-day Saints    Afterwards we visited Miltonburgers   Ironworks through each of its branches and saw the   keel laid for an iron steam ship of war. The keel was  140 ft. in length 
 Elder Charles Beck paid 48 dollars for   stage fare of six of the Twelve to Baltimore and   a collection was taken up of about 20 dollars to   assist us to Philadelphia at which place we   arrived on the 5th of August. having left Pittsburgh  on the 3rd.    On the ^Sunday^ afternoon of the 6th which   was Sunday we met in the Canaanite Church   about 300 Saints. Elder Grant opened the meeting   and ^which^ President Brigham Young addressed the  meeting at considerable length. Among other   things he said    "A man or a woman may   ask of God and get a witness and testimony from   [word erased] concerning any work or messenger sent   unto them; but if a person asks for a thing   that does not concern him such as governing   the Church &c he will not get an answer and   if he does it will not be from God"    He also remarked in conversation  upon the enquiry of, Who had the ^fulness of the^ Melchisidec  Priesthood that if any in the Church had it   he did not know it. For a person to have   ^the fulness of^ that Priesthood he must be a King and a   Priest. A person ^He^ might have a portion   of ^it^ that Priesthood the same as the governors or   Judges of England have power from the King to   transact business but he is ^they are^ not the King   of England. A person may be anointed   King and Priest before he receives his   Kingdom &c.    In the evening Orson Pratt  preached, followed by remarks from George   A Smith. One the morning of this   Sabath I went with Elder Young and others   to a Millerite Meeting. Here we heard   a Mr Litz preach a sermon destroying the   literal return of the Jews and rebuilding of Jerusalem 
 Two days afterwards the Twelve and   about 150 Saints took an excursion on board a steamer   As we glided over the water we passed the new frigate   Rariton of sixty four guns and reached Gloster Point  were we spent the day in feasting fishing swinging  walking singing and discussing various subjects    One of the subjects which arose   for discussion was, "Is the prosperity of any religious   denomination a positive evidence that they are right?"    Elder John E. Page contended for   the affirmative and Elder J. M. Grant for the negative   Brigham Young the chairman decided that the  prosperity of any people was no positive evidence   of their being right.    We returned to the city and   during the evening my mind was deeply exercised   with the impression that my wife was in distress   or afflicted. I prayed for her before the Lord   and my mind was releived    During the week we held meetings   several times and visited public places.    On one of the days Elders Young   O Pratt G. A Smith myself and P. Hesse visited   the State House, and on the top of the steeple we   had a fine view of the city of Philadelphia  Descending to the Indipendance Hall we saw the   place where the Patriots signed the Declaration   and sat in the chair in which John Hancock  sat in at the time he signed that instrument    Next day we visited various parts   of the city especially Peel's Museum where among many   other things of note we saw and examined the body   of the Mermaid and the skeleton of a Mamouth    On the 14th I parted from the   Philadelphia Saints and in company with Elders   Orson Pratt and Wm Moor took steamboat to   Skoolkill and then walked 6 miles to Mr. Mosley's   and preached in the evening followed by O. Pratt 
 We journeyed 27 miles the next day and   during our days ride we passed over the ground of   the Brandywine Battle saw where the action commenced   w[h]ere the Americans retreated and a part of them surrendered   and saw also where Washington led away the remainder   of the army    The day after Elder Moor and   myself travelled 25 miles to brother John Neffs in   Strasburgh and found him disposed to sell his   property and go to Nauvoo and take stock in the   Nauvoo House or Temple On the way we passed by   Bishop Edward Hunter's former residence and found  the country throughout this region exceedingly rich   and fertile    We continued our journey on   the succeeding day to West Nantmeal and on   the next in the evening met with Elder Pratt   and others and held meeting at West Nantmeal  Seminary and the day after commenced a two   days meeting 12 miles distant in a grove in   Uwchland Township    The second day of our camp   meeting was Sunday August 20th. A good   congregation came together and I addressed them   in the forepart of the day from the text—"If   our Gospel be hid it is hid to them that are   lost" &c. [##2 Corinthians 4:3##]    In the afternoon Elder O Pratt   delivered a powerful discourse from ##Revelation 22:3|Revelations   22 ch 3rd verse## "And there shall be no more   curse.["] He began with the fall and   traced his subject through to the Millennium the   Second Advent the binding of Satan and the   New heaven and the New earth when Christ shall   deliver the Kingdom up unto his Father and the   last enemy Death be destroyed.    Next day we returned by   rail to Philadelphia where we met Elder Grant 
 but found that the rest of the Twelve had left the city for   New York where we followed them two days later.    Conference at New York  held  August 26, 1843.    The quorum of the Twelve met the Saints   in Conference at New York on this day    After prayer President Young opened   the buisness of the Conference by an interesting address  upon the subject of the gathering, the Priesthood and the   building of the Temple and Nauvoo House.    In the afternoon Elder Kimball  spoke very graphically in parables; and Elder George  A. Smith followed with anecdotes. One related to   his collegiate education received from the Prophet which   was to preach short sermons and make short prayers    Remarks of President Brigham Young    Elder Young next spoke; and among other remarks   he said    "The Scriptures have been mistified   to that degree that the greatest divine of the day is   as ignorant as the dumb ass concerning the things   of God. They know not their right hand   from their left and we are trying to reverse it   by making the things of God so simple that   the people can understand    Place a man in this room who   is ignorant of science and take everything out that   we can see and then ask him if there is anything   in the room. He will say no nothing but   us two. I tell him there are millions of live  animals in the room and that even we breathe them 
 and I will show him by the aid of the m  that there are live animals in one drop of water   eight feet long but he will not beleive me until   he sees it through the magnifying glass.    So with the unbeleiver. He   does not beleived in God—in angels—in spirits  because he does not see them but let him have   spiritual glasses—or let him obey the commandments   of God and get the Spirit of God and then   he can see."    The following was also given    Interesting Questions & Answers    1st. Ques. Can any oficer in a Branch of the   Church say his word is law and should be   obeyed?    Ans.: No.    Ques. Is it right for a Priest to be joined to   a Teacher in visiting the houses of the members   when their duty is set forth in the Book of   Doctrines & Covenants?    Ans.: Yes any officer from an High   Priest to a Deacon may visit the Church and   be set apart for this purpose.    Ques.: If Elders or High Priests are   on an Island and cannot get word from the   Prophet or the Twelve may they get revelations   concerning themselves?    Ans.: The Twelve may get a   revelation concerning themselves. They may   get a revelation in any part of the world   concerning the building up of the Kingdom   as they have to establish the Kingdom in   all parts of the world. So any person   can ask the Lord for a witness concerning   himself. He can obtain an answer for 
 himself but not to lead the Church. That belongs to   the head of the Church."    Ques.: Can a Church make by laws   as an expediency for themselves which are not specified   in any revelation    Ans.: Yes if they wish they may make  laws to stick their fingers in their eyes.    Ques.: When any person is ordained   legally by vote of the Church to any office can he   be released from that office and Priesthood and hold   his standing in the Church    Ans.: No.    On the following day Conference was   continued. Meeting was opened by singing and   prayer by Elder Grant after which Elder Woodruff  delivered a discourse from the ##2 Peter 1:20-21|2nd Epistle of Peter  1st ch., & 20, 21 verses##.    Elder Kimball followed with   some appropriate remarks and in the afternoon   John E. Page gave a lengthy discourse proving the   divine mission of Joseph Smith and the truth   of the Book of Mormon.    In the evening Elder O. Pratt  delibered a masterly discourse upon the Book of   Mormon. He said it was the history of   nearly one half of the Globe and of the people who   had inhabited it—that it gave the history   of all the cities which had since it came forth   been discovered by Cartherwood and Stephens—  that it spoke of the establishing of our government   and what is more highly interesting it reveals   its final fate and destiny so that by reading   the Book of Mormon it may be clearly seen   what will befall this nation and what will   be its final end. In that Book is also the   Gospel as taught by Jesus Christ himself to the   ancient inhabitants of America and an account 
 of his ministry amongst them after his resurrection  and Assension. This was the pith of his discourse   occupying nearly two hours.    I left New York on the 29th in   company with Elders Davis and Wandell and having   visited Branches on my road I arrived at Farmington  my native place on the 2nd of September and   left my fathers house again on the 5th and   on the 8th arrived at the city of Boston where   I found Elder George A Smith and another   brother waiting for me at the station.    Conference   held by   The Quorum of the Twelve  at  at Boston in Boylston Hall  Sep. 9th, 1843.    There were present of the quorum of the Twelve  Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball Parley P. Pratt  Orson Pratt John E. Page Willford Woodruff  and George A. Smith    Elder G. A. Smith opened the   Conference by prayer and then President Young  called for the business of the meeting after which the   churches were represented    During this conference there   were discourses delivered by all the members of   the quorum of the Twelve present their subjects  being chiefly upon the gathering building the Temple  and kindred matters. It would be too lengthy to   give the synopsis of the whole of them as recorded   in my daily Journal of the time. The substance   of several must suffice. 
 Parley P. P. Pratt led the van upon the Gathering   and then President Brigham Young further laid before   the Conference the subject and design of this mission   of the Twelve to the eastern churches.    Synopsis  of the   Discourse of President Brigham Young    I wish to make a few remarks   concerning the subject of our faith. We hear the   Elders represent the feelings of the brethren concerning   the gathering    The Spirit of the Lord Jesus   Christ is a gathering Spirit. Its tendency is to   gather the virtuous and good—the honest and meek   of the earth—in fine the Saints of God.    The time has come when the   virtuous and ^Lord has^ determined to fulfill his purposes   "Had we lived in the days of Christ," the people   say, we would have received his work. But judge  ye if the people are better now than they were then.   They are not.    When the full set time was come   the Lord came in the flesh to do his work whether   the people were prepared or not. And now  the full set time is come for the Lord God Almighty   to set his hand to redeem Israel    We are not bound to make the   people beleive but to preach the Gospel and then   our garments are clear.    The Lord does not require every   soul to leave his home as soon as he beleives   but he requires him to hearken to counsel and   follow that course which the Lord points out    The Spirit of the Almighty and  of this work is on the elect ^alert^ and those who keep 
 up with the work must be on the alert also    When the Lord says gather   yourselves together why do you ask Him, what   for? Is it not the principle of the Saints to   mingle together to promote the great cause in   which we are engaged?    Do you say, cannot the Lord   save us as well where we are as to^when^ gathered together?  Yes if the Lord says so but if he commands   us to come out and gather together He will   not save us by ^our^ staying at home. Have you   not received the Gospel? Yes. Then do   you beleive what we say. Have you not received   the Holy Ghost by receiving the Gospel which   we have brought unto you? Yes; and  thousands have and it stands as a testimony   that God has a Prophet upon the earth    You might have been baptized   seventy times seven in any way except the one   God ordained and pointed out and you would   not have received the Holy Ghost. This also   is a testimony to you.    Are you engaged in the great   work with us? You will say Yes. Can you   do any good? you ^You can^ The sectarian world   send the Bible to the nations of the earth. The   people put in sixpence fifty cents or a dollar into   the box and send Bibles through the world. Then   cannot you do something? Yes.    The Lord requires us to build   a house unto His name that the ordinances and   blessings of his Kingdom might be revealed and   that the Elders may be endowed to go forth and   gather together the b[l]ood of Ephraim—the people   of God from the ends of the earth    Can you get an endowment in   Boston? No. And only in that place which   God has appointed. 
 Now query: Could Moses have got the   law had he remained in the midst of the children of   Israel and not gone into the mountain? The Lord said   Go and do so and so. Stand before Pharoah. Pull off   your shoes for the ground is holy &c. [##Exodus 3:5##] Moses obeyed   and obtained the blessing; but if he had not obeyed he   would not have obtained the blessing.    But why query about it at all? Has   the Lord spoken? Yes. Then that is enough. I   do not care whether the people gather or not. If they   don't want to I do not wish to save the people against   their will. I wish you to have your choice—either to   gather with the righteous or stay with the wicked.   I would like to have all people bow down to the Lord   Jesus Christ but it is one of the decrees of the Lord   that all persons shall act upon their agency which   was the case even with the angels that fell from   heaven    Now will you help us build   the Nauvoo House and Temple? If so you will   be blessed; if not we will build it alone. And   if you do not hearken you will not have the   Spirit of the Lord for the Spirit of the Lord   is in the gathering.    The Apostles tried to gather   together the people in their day. Christ said he   would have gathered the Jews oft as a hen gathereth   her chicken under her wings; but they would   not [##Matthew 23:37##]    It mattereth not to God and angels  whether men hear or forbear. They will carry   on their work for the full set time is come   We care about it. We must build a house and   get an endowment and preach the gospel warn   the people gather the Saints build up Zion   finish our work and be prepared for the coming   of Christ    Now we want to send missionaries 
 to the Islands. Can you do something for them? And   that is not all. We want you to contribute to the   building of the Temple. We want what you have to   spare. But are you affraid that you will not have   enough for yourselves when you get there? How easy   it is for the Lord to take it away from you by   fire and otherwise. E. P. Magin had an ivory   cane. I asked him for it but he did not give   it to me; but he soon lost it and it did neither   of us any good    The Lord can give and take away   Jacob with his faith obtained all the best cattle that   his father-in-law had. [##Genesis 30:35##] Who blesses you and all the   people. God. But do the people acknowledge   His hand in all things. No they turn away  from Him and do not acknowledge Him nor realize  from whom their blessings flow    Let me tell you a secret. When   the Lord shakes the earth and the hills fall   down and the valleys are exalted then for brass  He will bring gold for iron silver and for stones   iron. That you will have no use for gold ^for money^ and  ^and gods^ the like as you now have but the Lord will think   as much of it then as now.    Let us have some of your gold   to take to Nauvoo to build the Temple and Nauvoo   House so that when the kings princes and nobles   of the earth call to enquire after the wisdom of Zion  we myay have a place to entertain them, and   that the weary traveller may also be refreshed    Is there wisdom in Zion? We think   so; and the world begin to think so. Let the world   come forth and translate the plates that have of late   come forth if they have wisdom to do it.    The Lord intends to take away   the gods of the gentiles. He pulleth down and   buildeth up at his own pleasure. Dont be affraid  of a dollar or a hundred or a thousand dollars 
 I would not. I have made sacrifices a great many   times. The Lord has promised a hundred fold and   I have taken this course to get rich—to give all   I had, and God has given me many blessings in   consequence. If I have been too bold in asking then  be you too bold in giving. Give your all and   God will repay as much again."    In the afternoon Parley Pratt took up   the subject of the morning. He said they not only   wanted the gold and the silver but we want you  and your wives and children and all you have   He then spoke of the policy of Joseph in Egypt  and closed by saying    "Does the Saints here in Boston  know they are identified with the laying of the foundation   of a great and mighty work that is to enclude  all the great and glorious purposes of God which   are to be fulfilled in the last dispensation and   fulness of times. And I prophesy in the   name of the Lord that whether the Boston Saints   or who may stand for it or rise against it   that almost numberless millions will celebrate   that day when the foundation of this work  was laid."    Elder George A Smith followed   upon the subject of what ^seems^ to the people but small   things in the revelations of God in variosus ages   but showed their great importance in the issue   and instanced the building the ark &c. He   also took up the gathering and treated the meeting   to a spice of common ^sense^ versus the mysteries and   concluded with an illustrative anecdote of how   Elder Kimball was sent for by a certain people   and brought forty miles to preach the mysteries   and the amusing sequel of how he read them   a lesson of practical religion 
 Elder Brigham Young arose and said    "I will ^offer^ an apology for my remarks   in the forepart of the day. Some may think   I spoke very plain but the apology I have to   make is that I will turn Thomsonion docter   and give the composition without sweetening. This   work is all—it is my all. If this work does   not live God knows I do not want to live;   and I want you to understand that he that   gathereth not with us scattereth and they that   have tasted the bitter cup feel it    Wake up ye Elders who   have sought to build yourselves up and not   the kingdom of God! Wake up ye who   have daubed with untempered morter. Hearken   and hear me for I say unto ^you^ that if you   do not help us build the Temple and Nauvoo  House you shall not inherit the land of   Zion. If you do not help build up Zion   and the cause of God you shall not partake   of their blessings.    Many Elders seek to build   themselves up and not the work of God; but   when any one does this no matter who he   may be ^he will not prosper^ even if one of the Twelve. As to   those of the Twelve and others of the Elders who   have apostatised I have known their hearts &  their breathings and known their movements   They thought I did not know much but   I know all about them; and when I see  men preaching hte [to] build themselves up and   not Zion I know what it will end in. But   say you I am young. I do not care if   you are young. Do you know what you   are about. If so preach and labour for the   building up of the city of Zion. Concentrate   your means and influence there and not scatter  abroad. Be faithful or you will not be 
 chosen; for the day of choosing is at the door.    Why be afraid of a sacrifice?  I have given my all many times and am willing   to do it again. I would be glad to hear the Lord  say through His servant Joseph, let my servant  Brigham give again all he has. I would obey in   a moment if it took the last coat from off my   back"    Remarks of Elder Kimball    Among other things he said    "I speak in parables. I compare   the Saints to a good cow. When you milk her  clean she will always have abundance of milk to   give; but if you milk her a little and she will   soon dry up. So with the Saints. If they   do but little in building up Zion they soon have   but little to do with. This was the case   in Cincinnati. I had a dream concerning   the Saints there. I thought I was in a field   of wheat that was stacked up; and we had to   draw it into the barn; but when we came to   open the stack the bundles would all fall to   pieces and it was filled with clusters of rats   and mice who had been eating up the grain  I thought that these rats and mice were the   Elders and official members who had been in  and laying on the Church—living on the wheat,   eating them up instead of building up new  churches so that when the Twelve came along   they could not get anything for the Temple or   Nauvoo House or hardly a place to stay the   rats had eaten up the wheat so. We had to   go to the world for a home to stay while we   were there.    We are not polished stones like Elders 
 Babbit Adams Blakely Magin and the like. We   are rough stones out of the mountain and when we   roll through the forest and knock the bark off   the trees it does not hurt us even if we should   get a corner knocked off occassionally. The more   we roll and get the corners knocked off the better   we are; but if we were polished and smooth when   we got the corners knocked off it would deface   us    This is the case with Joseph Smith.  He never professed to be a dressed smooth polished   stone but was rough out of the mountains and   has been rolling among the rocks and trees and it   has not hurt him at all. But he will be as   smooth and polished in the end as any other   stone while many that were so very polished and   smooth in the beginning get badly defaced and   spoiled while rolling about."    Elders Parley P and Orson Pratt followed and   then the Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock the   next morning    ^We continued^ Conference the next day which was   Sunday and in the morning I preached a lengthy   discourse from the ##Amos 3:7|3rd ch of Amos verse 7th##.    I left Boston on the 12th of September   at 5 o'clock p.m. in the Express train for Portland  and at about 10 o'clock while passing through Chester  woots 6 miles south of Kennebunk the engine   was thrown from the track in consequence of a rail  being raised eight inches by some designing miscreant  The force was such that it drove the engine   about five rods ahead and smashed it to pieces with   the baggage cars piled upon the top of it    One lady was brused but not dangerously   and another was slightly injured. The lives of many   were in danger and it seemed a mystry that so little 
 injary was done. Four cars were filled with passengers and   had not the force of the coll^issin^ been broken by the baggage   cars many lives would have been lost.    The baggage car^s^ was^ere^ soon on fire which   was with difficulty extinguished. The fireman was   thrown about three yrods and escaped with a slight injury   but the engineer Mr Adams from Portland was   burried beneath the pile and instantly killed and the   ruins had to be removed before the corps of the illfated   engineer could be optained. No blame could be   attached to him for the raised rail gave no warning   until the engine and baggage cars were in one pile   of ruins. The unfortunate man left a wife and   one child    A Mr Thomas Hall opened his   house for the passengers and much praise was due   to him and his houshold for their hospitality    I spent most of the night in the   woods and got chilled through    They sent to Portland for another   engine which arrived in time to take us to Portland   in the morning.    Arriving at Portland I furnished the   Editor of the American with    The Account of our Railway Accident    I visited my brother-in-law Ezra Carter and   wrote two more letters giving an account of the foregoing   catastrophe—one was to the Editor of the "Boston Bee"  the other to Elder John Taylor Editor of the "Times   and Seasons"    On the same day I walke to   Scarbourough and arrived in the evening at the house   of my wife's parents. Father Carter was at New  York. I came upon Mother so sudden as she   was walking across the room with a candle that   she was as much surprised as though I had come 
 down from the skies and her first salutation was where  did you come from?    This was the first time I had been to   my f wife's parents house without Phebe being with me   and I felt like the dove without its mate. But   after conversing till 9 o'clock with mother and Fabyan  my wife's brother-in-law I prayed with them and   then retired to my chamber and there prayed for my   absent companion and our children.    Next day I rode round the country   with my brother-in-law Fabyan visiting our friends   and relations. I called at Mr Millikens and   found Arthur Milliken and his wife Lucy the youngest   sister of the Prophet Joseph. They were both home   sick for Nauvoo    The next two days passed in   family associations and after spending the evening of   the second day in conversing with Faban, Rhoda  and mother about Mormonism & I took my light   and went to bed fearing I should no[t] see Father  but just as I was about to blow the light out a wagon   drove up and I jumped out of bed dressed and was   soon down grasping the hand of my wife's father.  I sat up and talked with him till about 11 o'clock   and I thought both Father and Mother looked no   older than when I saw them before and they were   enjoying excellent health. It seemed quite natural   the next morning to sit at the table with my   wife's parents again but I very much missed   Phebe during this visit. The day after  I took my final call upon my friends and relatives   and bade them adieu and then took the   cars and arrived in Boston that night.    The next day after my return   to Boston I called upon George A Smith and   ^brother^ W W. Phelps. In the afternoon I went on   the parade ground and saw the militia in a sham   fight and they made quite a splendid appearance 
 On the following evening I visited the celebrated   phenologist O. S. Fowler of Boston who had examined  the heads of the Twelve. He gave me    My Phenological Chart.    Wilford Woodruff:    Is a man of great action both   physical and mental; does up things in a hurry;  lets nothing sleep in his hands; great resolution;  steamboat speepd; loves his liberty; is not disposed   to be subject to the will or dictations of others; has   great indipendance; difficulties only stimulate him  to increased action; goes in for the largest liberty   of the mass and is a democrat of the old school;   prefers utility to beauty and substance to show;   highly social and fond of family and friends; has   but few secrets of his own and tells the plain un-  varnished facts; fears but little danger; is not   irressolute but descides and proceeds at once to action;  His first thoughts are always best. He does up his   own religious thinking and does not hang his hopes upon   the faith of others. He believes but little without proof;   is a two edged sword—if he does not cut one way,   does another. He makes positive friends or positive   enemies; has much severity; is sarcastic; bitter  in reproaches; means to do right; feals the   force of moral obligations. His jokes have more   vinegar than molasses in them. He recolects   and explains facts well; reasons by inference from   the facts, by analogy and induction; has good   talking talents; and is noted for his clear illustrations    Boston September the 20th 1843:    O.

 I took a walk with George A Smith to Charlston  on the 22nd. We first visited the Navy Yard of the   United States then the dry dock and next the U.S.   Rope-Walk which we inspected in all its branches    We took dinner and then visited   Bunker Hill Monument. I entered the tube and   was drawn up by steam 2210 feet where I had a   view of all Boston Charleston, Cambridge Chelsea &c  and then descended by the same way. Next   came the State prisons with 262 prisoners at their   various branches of business    After seeing each appartment   we returned to Boston where we held meeting which   was addressed by John E. Page H. C Kimball  P. P. Pratt Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith    Next day ^23rd^ I called upon brother  Heber C. Kimball who let me have one hundred dollars   ^on P. P. Pratts act^ to purchase paper with; and on the same   day started per rail to Westfield and when ^I^ we  got to my destination for the day I found that   P. P. Pratt and Erastus Snow were in the car before   me without our knowing it. I parted with them   and they continued homeward    I continued my journey the next   day ^24th^ and on the following I reached Farmington  my native place and four days later again   left my father's house and arrived in New York  on the next day where I found Elder Brigham  Young.    On the 3rd of October I took   steamboat to Philadelphia and in the evening   there met five of the quorum of the Twelve and   other Elders    Next day the others of the quorum   of the Twelve started for Pittsburg I also left for   home on the following day and a large number of   the Saints started per rail from ^Philadelphia^ in   the morning bound for Nauvoo. 
 ^Error see.^ On my journey homeward I made large purchases of   paper &c at [blank]    An Exciting Part of My Journey.    The 19th was one of the most exciting and dangerous day's   journey possible in any persons life and the scenes through   which we passed was full of the grand and awful    Our boat was drawn out of the canal on   cars prepared to run ^on^ the railroad to convey us over the Allegany   mountain    It was a novel scene indeed to see a canal   boat taken apart into four sections loaded with freights and   passengers and hoisted ^on^ a railroad by incline plains into the   air 1500 feet over the highest mountains and then descend   into the valley below in the same way    ^On starting^ Horses were hitched to our cars and they drew   us four miles and a half and then we were at the first incline   plain which we had to asscend. Two cars were fastened   at the top of the plain to the same rope that connected   with ours at the bottom and the engine was stationed   in a building at the sumimit of the plain which   drew up and let down the cars    When all was ready the signal   was given by raising a red flag the engine was   put in motion and the cars started. The first   plain was half a mile long and raised one hundred   and eighty feet. We went up in two minutes   and I was thankful to reach the top for had   the rope broke or the fastning become untied we   should have rolled back to the bottom with a tremendious   crash    Plain No 2 raised 125 feet in half   a mile and our boat rocked badly while going up   but no accident hapened. We then continued on 
 a level until we came to the next incline plain.    Plain No 3. was one mile and a quarter   long and it rose 320 feet which we ascended in four   minutes. Before we reached the top the safety car  which was attached to our boat was thrown from   the track which ^and^ dragged many rods throwing the   rope off the wheels. I made a sign to the   engineer who stoped and it was replaced. Here   again we were in danger of breaking the rope which   would have sent us back down the mountain more   than a mile or turned us over into the yawing  gulf below. In either case we should have   been dashed to atoms. My hair rose on my   head but having got all things ready we proceeded   on to Plain No 4.    This plain was three quarters   of a mile long and ascended 265 feet. We   reached the summit of this in three minutes but   it looked awful to be thus suspended almost   in the air with such a weight of lives and freight   depending upon a knot, a rope, a pin, an   engine and the care of a man which should either   give way would have dashed us to atoms unles  saved by a miracle    We next continued on to Plain  No 5 which was 3/4 of a mile long and rose 280 ^feet^   This we ascended also in three minutes which   brought us on to the Summit of the Allegany   mountains four miles from the base and eleven   hundred and seventy feet in height.    I felt thankful to God that   we were on the top of the mountain alive but   we had to descend in the same way that we   ascended. There was snow on the Summit and it was   exceedingly cold. We ran on the top of the mountain   about three miles and then began to descend    There were six incline plains   to descend to the bottom of the mountain the 
 whole of which was attended with equal danger and carelessness    As we came upon the brink of one of them   it was found the men had left the breakers and the cars   were about to run down the horses. The conducter seeing   this hollowed for the man to break but finding no one at the breakers  and the cars approaching the incline plain the teamster   liberated his horses as soon as possible and they only just   escaped being run down and the conductor sprang to the   breaker himself and with great exertion barely saved us from   madly running down the plain and being dashed to atoms    I was standing in the cars at the   time and instantly throwing off my cloak prepared myself   for leaping out in case the cars should start down the   plain. In either case it might have killed me but   I knew it was certain death to be dashed downward and   chose the alternative of a desperate chance in leaping out   but through the mercy of God we were stoped at the   very brink    The whole passage across the mountains  was a constant scene of danger and I called upon God   in my heart to preserve my life    Even while on a level we were running   on the edge of a precipice hundreds of feet deep over   which if a wheel had broken or run off the track the   cars would have plunged awfully down and made an   end of all flesh on board.    We passed through one tunnel in the   mountain and when we reached the bottom of the incline   plains I felt thankful to God that we were mostly   out of danger but the^y^ put the boat together and started   on the rail with all on board without horse or steam  and the railroad being a little on the descent it increased   in speed until it ran at a rapid rate and we   were still in danger of being upset. The train ran   of itself for about four miles until it came to the   canal and here again to finish the day with   danger a train of cars was left in our track and   with all the power that could be exerted on the breaks 
 we just escaped a smash up at last. We finally got   launched into the water again with no bones broken or   lives lost. In conversing to ^with^ the mate in the evening  upon the subject of our passage across the mountains   he remarked we were not sensible of one half   the danger we had passed during the day but for   one I was sensible of a great deal at least    Two days after this we arrived   at Pittsburg and I immediately engaged passage   for myself and freight of paper to St Louis started   the same day and met Elder Erastus Snow at   Bever with a company of 50 Saints bound for Nauvoo  Next day they took passage on the North Bend  and on the Alps    Passing over farther intermediates  of my journey I arrived in St Louis re-shipped  my freight and reached Nauvoo on the 4th of   November and never felt anyone more thankful   to tread its soil again than myself.    The week after my arrival home   I spent in looking after my affairs and found them   in a bad condition. My house which I commenced   before I left and expected to find reared and with   its roof on I found built only a few feet from   the ground    On the 7th I attended Council   with the Twelve and was appointed with John Taylor  Parley P. Pratt and Brigham Young as a committee   to raise five hundred dollars to purchase paper   to print the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.    Sealing of myself and Wife.

 An Adulterer cannot be saved in the Celestial Kingdom.    According to the Doctrine of Joseph the Prophet    In the High Council on the case of Harrison Sagers  for improper conduct offered to a female Joseph in an address  said "The Church has not received any license from him   to commit adultery fornication or any such thing but to   the contrary. If any man commits adultery he cannot  receive the celestial Kingdom of God. Even if he is saved   in any Kingdom it could not be in the celestial Kingdom."    He said he thought the many who had   been made examples such as John C. Bennet and others  was sufficient to show the heineous fallacy of such conduct  He condemned it in unqualified terms and warned those   present against such evil or they would surely bring a   curse upon the heads of the guilty.    Joseph afterwards met with the Twelve  and he informed us that General Fryeson was in town and   wished an interview with us. He had come for the   purpose of getting a memorial in our behalf written to Congress    Next day Sunday the 26 Presidents  Joseph and Hyrum Smith with the quorum of the Twelve   sat in Council with the General and there were read   to him the affidavits of Hyrum Smith Brigham Young  P. P Pratt Lyman Wight George W. Pitkin and   Sidey Rigdon    On the Sabbath morning Dec 2nd  P. P. Pratt Orson Hyde Wilford Woodruff and O Spencer  received their anointings preparatory to farther endowment    On the 7th a messenger arrived   from St Louis informing us that the Governor of Missouri  had issued another writ for Joseph and that he was about   to make a demand for him of the governor of Illionis    Joseph had just made a touching appeal   to the Green Mountain Boys of Vermont for assistance  in obtaining redress of his wrongs in the persecutions  of Missouri. We published it in pamplet form and 
 sent ^it^ to the authorities of the United States    The City Council was ^and^ called to ^and^ pass^ed^ an   ordinance the purport of which was that anyone henceforth   who should come to take Joseph Smith on the old   Missourian difficulties should be imprisoned in the  city jaol for life unless pardoned by the Governor   with the consent of the mayor. This was published   in an extra sheet of the Neighbour    A few days after this a man by   the name of Elliot one of the Missourian Kidnappers   who had ran bretheren out of Illinois to Missouri  and put them in prison was brought to Nauvoo  on a warrant and bound under 3000 dollars bonds   He was also under another warrant for threatening   the life of Joseph and the charge was proved   against him but the Prophet forgave him   and he was discharged. On the case Joseph made   an eloquent speech manifesting mercy towards his   enemies when they were in his power but with   uplifted hands he declared that if Missouri   came against us any more he would fight them   and defend his rights    A warrant was also issued   against Col Williams who was the leader of the   kidnapping affray but he had gathered around   him a mob and swore defiance so the officers   returned to Nauvoo for counsel and assistance    On the 23rd At President Joseph Smith's   I with my wife met with the quorum through   the day in the endowments. Brother and   Sister Morley O Pratt & Sisters Lot ^Fanny Murry^  Phebe W. Woodruff ^Barsheba Smith sister O Spencer & Phelps^  [blank] received their anointing.    Thwo days afterwards was Christmas   day A large party met at the Nauvoo Mansion   and had a splendid dinner and supper; but   I was invited by Elder Alexander to meet at his   house with my family and spend the day with 
 the Tennessee Saints. I did so and there were with   us brother Smoot and his family.    The farther duties of a few days more in   my official calling and in attending to my family affairs   and forwarding the building of my house brought   us to the close of the year    Synopsis of 1843.    Travels    I travelled in thirteen of the United States and   the distance of five thousand one hundred and   seventy one miles.    Meetings    Held twenty six meetings and attended 20 Councils   and Conferences    Baptisms &c    I baptized six persons ordained five Elders blessed  fifteen childreen and administered to 25 sick ^and   confirmed ten^    Marriedages    I married two persons    Writings & Reports    I wrote 25 letters received 12 and reported and recorded  in my journal seven discourses of Joseph the Prophet  and reported and recorded eight sermons of the Twelve    Labours of the Year    My time not occupied on my mission east was spent   mostly in the Printing Office for which I also   while on my mission purchased paper and obtained subscribers.

Dear Brethern:    Answering your favor  of 25th ins't. will say: I will take pleasure  in carefully following your suggestions.    The brethern are all well and we  have appointments for the present week,  and we feel that our Heavenly Father is  blessing us in our labors.

 COLORADO MISSION.    879 South Corona Street,  Denver, Colorado    May 17, 1897.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City,  Utah.    Dear Brother:    Elder Franklin D. Richards wrote me under  date of May 14, 1897, and wanted to know if the five Eld-  ers from the Brigham Young Academy of Provo, spent their  summer vacation in the Colorado Mission, if they could  or would pay their own expenses. In answer to the same  I would say, they are all able and willing to pay their   own expenses.    Should you decide to send the brethern here it woul[d]  oblige me if you would send me word to that effect as  it would give me time to arrange to receive them, and I  can notify each of them before they leave Provo just  where to get off train so as to save them exrtra expense  in going from Denver to their several fields of labor,  which would be probably from $2.590 to $5.00 each.    We had a very pleasant meeting at Overland yesterday  afternoon in a grove of trees near the Platte river,  after meeting^,^ Mr. Richmond and family requsted baptism.  Two ladies and a Mr. Hoover and Wife of Denver, and a Mr.  Swigart of Fort Logan have requested Baptism, and we will 
 attend to the matter in the near future.    There are three families that desire to emigrate from  Overland to some place in Utah, where they can take up  land. They have come to me for advice; would it be proper  for me to recommend them to go into the Ashley country  in Pres. Bennion stake? If not kindly inform me what is   your desire concerning them, and I will advise them  accordingly.    Ashley can be reached by team much easier than  any other part of Utah from this place.    The Elders are all well and working faithfully in the  missionary field and are being kindly received by the  people.    Prtaying God to bless you with health and strength  and asking a kind remembrance to all the brethren,    I remain, Your brother in the Gospel,    John W. Taylor    [Joseph Fielding Smith] Under these circumstances it will   be proper to issue calls to the brethren  named, (bro. F. D. Richards has the list)  to serve as missionaries in Colo.  during their vacation, leaving it  to their judgment or discretion to  decide to accept or not on the con-  ditions named—that they will bear  their own expenses. The church not  being in a condition financially 
 to do it. I think it would  be as well for bro. Taylor to  recommend the parties he names  who desire his counsil on the  matter to go to Ashley. Bro.  Taylor should notify the  authorities at Ashley of their  intention to go there, if they  so decide, and about the  time to look for them, so  that they may be properly  received and looked  after.

 John W. Taylor  Aug. 19 [18]97    Manassa.   Conejas County  Colarado  Aug 19, 1897    Prest. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah    Dear Brother:    On Aug 1st Elders Geo H.  Brimhall, H. S. Ensign, Charles Mann, David  Mann, J. H. Grant, Herbert A. White, Wm C.  Clive and I came to Manassa. We spent 3   days in the Kanyon up the Conejas river  with 100 of the saints and their friends  rusticating and we had a very enjoyable  time upon returning to the valley we  held meeting in Manassa, Sanford,  Richfield, Morgan, Sunflower, Antoneto and  Eastdale, at the latter place I ordained Bishop  Jensen as per your instructions to Prest. 
 2    Albert R. Smith.    Haveing one week left to spare before con-  ference, which convened in Manassa on  Aug 14th and 15th I felt a very strong desire  to preach the gospel to the gentiles who  was liveing among the cities of the saints  in this valley. I made my desire known to  President Albert R. Smith and councillors and  when I told them, I was strongly impressed  to go from house to house and visit the  strangers and their families in our midst  they heartily approved of the suggestion. I  called to my assistance several of the sisters  we met together with the Presidency of the stake ^and^  Bishop Jackson and pps sisters and we fasted  and prayed unto the Lord to give us access to   the hearts of the people and asked our heavenly  father to soften the hearts of those whom  we went to see, and open their eyes   that thay may see their sins and 
 3    also see the necessity of serving God and  repenting of their ^sins^ and unite with the  saints in building up the Kingdom of  God in this land, and we made covenant  that we would fast till the following  day. And I stood up among the Elders  and the spirit of Prop^h^ecy came upon   me and bore testimony that if we were  faithful ^the Lord would send his angels before our face and^ many would beleive on our  words and would repent of  o their  sins and go into the waters of  baptism, and every one spoke and bore  testimony they beleived in my words.    We took a list of all the gentiles  within a circuit of about 20 miles  and s[e]perated ourselves and went out  two by two and divided up the families  equally among us which was  about 40 in all, and went forth  trusting in the Lord, and we took with 
 4    us tracts, voice of Warning, books of Mormon  and other works that teaches the word of God  and we went by day and by night into  their homes, and we searched them out and  if they were 5 or 6 miles away from  home we went and found them, and  explained plainly why we had come unto  them, and many beleved on our words  and promised to come out to our meetings  at conference time, but some did not  beleive, but would say unto us: "if the  contentions among the mormons was  the fruits of Mormonism they did  not such a gospel as we taught &c"  but we showed unto them what they  had seen among the saints was the  weakness of man and ^that^ perfection did  not dwell in the flesh, and we  contended for the faith and for the  Plan of salvation and which God had 
 Colorado Mission.  1950 South Pennsylvania Street,  Denver, Colorado.  June 30, 1897.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City,  Utah.    Dear Brother:    Having changed my address you will please   forward all mail to me as above.    We have a baptism at Overland tomorrow, and I am happy to  report that we have nine applications for the same, and a  number of promising prospects.    We have baptized 43 person during the past six months.  Elder W. C. Clive met with quite a serious bicycle accident  about four weeks ago, which has di[s]abled him for about a  month forom performing any missionary labor, but is now al-  most well again and will go into the missionary field next  week.    The reports from all the ELders are to the effect  that they are holding meetings, and that they are treated  kindly by the peopie.    We are making a special effort to sell our church works  as we find that the people will read a book that they pay  for, whereas if it is given to them they are liable to lay  it aside and not read it. 
 5    restored again to the earth and while we met  some opposition God was with us and  we bore testomony unto them standing up in  their homes in the power and demonstration  of the Holy Ghost. We invited them to   our meetings and conference and left them  books to read and promised them if they  would read them with good and honest  hearts and a prayerful spirit that  God would reveal unto them the  things that was written therein was  true, and thus we visited them all.    We held conference Saturday and  Sunday and I felt constrained to advise  the Elders to confine their remarks to  the repentance, faith, and baptism  and the laying on of hands and to  bear testimony of ^the prophet^ Joseph Smith  and the Divinity of the Book of  Mormon. 
 We held a conference on June 19th and 20th in the city of  Denvsr and it seemed to have a very good effect upon the  people, and has been t[h]e means of gaining for us more friends  We will hold a conference in Pueblo July 17th and 18th.    We could use several more ELders to very good   advantage.    Praying God to bless you, and asking an interest  in your faith and prayers, I remain    Your brother in the Gospel.    John W. Taylor    Very good report. Has he  got all those he named  some time ago? Let us rustle  up a few Elders for Colorado,  as soon as we can. J. F. S. 
 6    Our conference was held in a fine Bowery  buildt by the saints of Sanford.    The Lord poured out his Holy spirit  upon the young Elders as they spake  one bye one and the singing rendered by  them seemed Devine, and the Holy spirit  bore witness unto all who was honest  that their testimony was true.    On monday we had the pleasure  of takeing 45 down into the watters of  baptism, and from 800 to 1000 persons  came out to witness the sons and  daughters of God receive a remission  of their sins for the people rejoiced to  see the wicked come into the fold of Christ    We held a Priesthood meeting in  Sanford and the Lord blessed us with his spirit  and a number of men who had been in  transgressiong came forth at the close  of the meeting and confessed their sins 
 John W. Taylor  June 30 [18]97 
 7    for I was constrained to call upon the  Priesthood to repent of their sins and  sustain the authorities of the stake and  be one with them, and put away all  lieing and evil speaking against them  and I read unto them sec 121 of  the Book of Doctrine and Covenants and  bore testimony unto them that the  words of the Lord would not fail  and their hearts was softened, and at  the close of the meeting the spirit  of God wrought upon them so  mightily that they cried like  children, and came forward and  asked President Smith's pardon,  and promised to do anything that was  required of them and everything was  fixed up, and all is now united  again in this stake and peace and  harmony prevails among the 
 8    Priesthood and Saints.    Grain crops are heavy in this valley  the Potatoe crop is light, grain is  ripe and all the farmers are now in  the harvest field.    I leave for D Pueblo to night  I would recommend the name of  John C. Dalton Jr to go on a   mission and with your permission  would be pleased to have him in  this mission.    Very well, let it be so, and  let bro Taylor & Prest. A. R. Smith set him apart. J. F. S.    I have just received word from  Elder Robinson that 2 families in   Colorado Springs has applied for  baptism    Praying God to bless you and  lengthen out your days upon the earth  and asking a Kind remembrance to Presidents  Cannon and Smith and all the brethern  I remain 
 9    Your brother in the Gospel  John W. Taylor    The Elders are all well I have  put three in the north end of this  valley in Rio Grand and Costillo  counties.    J. W. T.    Aug. 23d [18]97 read to Prest. W.  Woodruff and he pronounced  it "a good letter." I sincerely hope  the reconciliation among the  Saints will prove genuine and  and permanent. And that  those who have been baptized  will stay baptized, repentant  and faithful. Then indeed we  should all be thankful, and  give gratitude to God. I would  be glad to feel confident that  the work done will prove genuine. J. F. S.    over 
 Let Dalton be called and  bro. Taylor & Prest. A. R. Smith  can set him apart.    J. F. S.
