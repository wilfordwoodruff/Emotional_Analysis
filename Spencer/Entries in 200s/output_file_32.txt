But I  said I was willing to receive a paper setting forth the faith and  progress of the Mormon Church, and to refer that paper to Dr. Barrows, and the General Committee of which he was Chairman, for  such use as they might think proper; and I understood that such a  paper would be prepared and presented, by or through Elder Roberts.

The work of organization  of the World's Congresses of 1893 was commenced in October 1889. General proclamations of the proposed Congresses were widely pub- lished throughout the world, inviting the cooperation of appropriate organizations.  Applications from such organizations were re- ceived from time to time while the Congresses of the different De- partments were in course of organization.  The World's Congress season commenced on May 15th 1893, and in strictness, no applica- tion made after the first of that month was entitled to considera- tion.
