I resolved, however, that after the close of the Congresses I would address to you the present communication.  I explained to Elder Roberts, in the presence of a mutual  friend/ that there was not, nor ever had been, any desire on our  part to sit in judgment on the faith of the Mormon Church and to  discriminate against it; but that, as we all know, there had been  a long-standing and violent prejudice on the part of the general  American public against the Mormon Church and people on account of  their practice, or supposed practice of polygamy; and I seriously  feared that the admission of the Mormon Church into the Religious  Congresses of 1893 would re-excite that prejudice, and thereby  work great harm, even should we agree that the renunciation of  polygamy had been made and was kept in perfect good faith.  But I  said I was willing to receive a paper setting forth the faith and  progress of the Mormon Church, and to refer that paper to Dr. Barrows, and the General Committee of which he was Chairman, for  such use as they might think proper; and I understood that such a  paper would be prepared and presented, by or through Elder Roberts. This is all which I then thought, or have since felt, it would be  wise and just to do under all the circumstances of the case.  When I learned that Dr. Barrows, instead of reserving the  ENDENTRY Brigham City Nov. 6. 1893  President Woodruff,  Dear Sir  I received your letter of of the 4th, calling me to go on a mission to the Indian Territory to leave Salt Lake City on the 21  of Nov.

But while I was surprised at this liberal action on the part  of Dr. Barrows, I was much more astonished by the refusal of Elder  Roberts to read his paper there, and his complaining because he was  not invited to read it in one of the general sessions of the Par- liament.

General proclamations of the proposed Congresses were widely pub- lished throughout the world, inviting the cooperation of appropriate organizations.  Applications from such organizations were re- ceived from time to time while the Congresses of the different De- partments were in course of organization.
