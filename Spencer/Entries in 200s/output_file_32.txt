 He has related his experience  to me a number of times without  any variation, the last time being  yesterday, and when talking of you  I sugested the propriety of him trying  to have an interview with you  at which he expressed great pleasure  but said that he did not know  how to obtain such interview.    I then kindly offered to write you  upon the matter which offer he  accepted with many thanks, promising  that could such event take place  he would listen to and obey  whatever counsel you might have  to impart.    Trusting this will receive your  kind attention.    I am your Bro in the Gospel  John Sears.    #746 E. 2nd S St.

President Wilford Woodruff,  City,    Dear Brother:    I beg to acknowledge the recipt of your notice  bearing date of January 30th that my name had been suggested and accepted  as a Missionary to Great Britain. I will say that I feel that it is my  duty to respond to the call. The reason I have not answered sooner is  that I did not have any money to take me to the place that you have  assigned me to. I have not had work for a year, as I have been studying  short hand and typewriting, and trying to prepare myself for a reporter,  so that I did not have ready money enough; to I have, however, made  arrangements with my brother for the necessary means, and am pleased to  say that I will be ready to leave on the day you have named, viz: April  9th 1890.

There are  numerous other reasons that I  could give for requesting a  change from Somoa to Europe,  all probably more or less  selfish, yet I sincerely feel  that I could with God's bless-  ing, fill an honorable mission  in Germany or England.

I suppose  the Stake Presidency sggested his name in  the first place when he was about 15 years old  he hasd a sun stroke which brought on fits  but it is seldom now that he has them, but  I fear the excitement in traveling may bring  them on again & it would not be safe for him  to be awy from those that know how to treat him  at such times & further he is just making a  start & is very short of means. he has nothing to 
 essary means to go with  which I have not got my-  self.

Lange  be released for one year; as you   see through his letter that his  Financial afairs is not very  good, and he will be of great  benefit to the Ward under the  pPresent circumstances.

Hehnen Sie es mir nicht übel, wenn ich so frei bin,  mit diesen Schreiben Ihr Ausverksamkeit in Auszuch zu mich  um. Ich möchte wir zunacht einen gefallige Auskunft von  Ihren erbitten. Ich bin ein deutscher protestentischer Pastor u  beabsichtige zur Mormonenkirche uberzutreten und ihr  in Pradigtant zu dienen, wenn es Gott will. Ich ken  ne die Mormonenkirche nur aus den theologischen diszip  linen, nicht aus der Praxis. Ich bin aber geneigt, eine Zeit  lang entweder in einem College zu gehen, oder mich bei  einem Pradiger der Mormonenkirche aufzuhelten, um die   Lehre u. Verhaltung der Mormonenkirche kennen zu ler  nen. Ich will mich bei dem betreffinden Pradiger nutzlich  machen im Unterricht im deutschen an seinen Kindern, wen  er welche hat; sondern Arbeiten, zum Beispiel ein Landwerk,   oder Landwirthschaft, kann ich nicht treiben, da ich solche Arbeiten  nicht gelernt, sondern von Jugend auf Studirn betrieben habe;)  & [], z.b. aus der Symbolik

I have seen many of the Saints  increasing in stedfastness, which I know must be a  source of joy to those who preside over them. On the  other hand I have seen those who once rejoiced in the  gospel who have not only turned their backs upon the  same, but have become persecuters of those who

 adhere to its truths and have wrung their hearts with  sorrow, and have asked myself the question, "Where will  these things end?" But the Lord reigneth"! "He will judge  the people righteously." I confess that I often feel pained  and discouraged, when I think of our present condition.    I have not had the oppurtunity to progress as many  of my Sister's have - having lived nearly my "three score  years and ten," before I embraced the Gospel and my mind  had become too weak to grasp the Principles of the Gospel  so readily as many others have done, yet the Holy Spirit has  shown one beyond a doubt that this is the Gospel of the Son  of God. Its Principles are very dear to my heart, and I  know that obedience to the same, will land me safe behind  the Veil - to dwell with those who have gone before.    I am not often able to attend meeting, but I have  watched closely, the progress, trials and also the inconsis-  tances of our people. It does my soul good to see those who  amidst severe trials - are clinging with a firm grasp to the  "Rod of Iron", but it pains me more than I can tell to  find that amongst a certain class of Saints, the habit is  growing so strong of censuring and speaking ill of some  of our best Brethren and Sisters, and making "Hearts

But I would not  mind, to go for some time and study in  one of your colleges, or to stay with a preacher  of the Mormon church, to get acquainted  with the doctrine and constitution of the  Mormon church.

I am not wishing or intending to find fault with  anyone -- I have too many faults of my own, but I have  been led into this strain while thinking of our respected  Dr Isaacson. I know him well and am a true friend  of his, as long as he continues firm in the faith of the  gospel. I have beenn made unhappy many times by hearing  him Slandered by those who ought to have encouraged  him. And not knowing what was true or what was false  I was very thankful for the oppurtunity to pay them a ten  days visit, and to my heartfelt satisfaction I found the  utter falsity of what I had heard. I found him and his  Noble Wife living in a atmasphere made pure by the  Spirit of the Gospel -- beloved by the Saints by whom they  are surrounded. I have heard him plead with the Lord  for blessings on the heads of our Presidency and upon our  beloved Zion as no man could do that was not inspired  by the Spirit of God. I found cheerfulness, peace ang good-  will dwelling in his home, which made me very reluctant  to leave it, and I cannot say that I found anything to  condemn.

I know by experience that the  change to him must have been very great and painful.    I too, have left my Country, my Relatives and all that is  dear to me.

But I know that there are many Germans  in the Mormon church, and also several  families from my former neighborhood in  Germany; there was once a Mormon missionary  active in a neighboring town and met with  quite good success. But I am sorry that  I never made the gentlemans acquaintance,  because I then took not the interest in the  Mormon church, which I take at present.  I have very good testimonials; in the old  country I was for some time active as  traveling preacher.  Some time ago I found your address in a  German Methodist paper, which gave a treatise  on the moral situation in the Mormon  church.

Dr Isaacson has douptless, in common with us  all, his imperfections and weaknesses, but I daily pray  that the Lord would keep him humble, that he may  ever have the mind of his Lord and Master, and be kept  steadfast in the truth, and that the work of Translation  which is going on, may be the means in the hands of God  of bringing many of His Ancient and chosen people into this  Fold.

Dear Bro:    In the latter part of July  I received a notification for a mission to Great Britian  and I was to start the ninth of this month, but being at  that time engaged in Rail Road Contracts it was impossible  for me to be ready at that date. I called twice at your office  but did not find you there so did not report sooner on that  account. I am please to state that my (that my) circumstances  are such that I can leave some time in November if it  meets your wishes. I am very desirous of going this fall  and will not object to traveling alone should there be  no other missionaries leaving at that time. I have not  been at Fillmore since I received my notificaion so for  this reason Bp. Callister endorsment will not accompany this  reply. Trusting that I am worthy to fill a position of thisat  kind creditably, that this late reply is acceptable. That you may  have health, strength & joy in all your labors and the blessings  of our heavenly Father to attend you continually. I remain With  Kind regards Your Brother in the Gospel    Samuel A King.    Address Valley House S. L. C.    OK   L J n
