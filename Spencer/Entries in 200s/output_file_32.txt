I confess that I often feel painedand discouraged, when I think of our present condition.I have not had the oppurtunity to progress as manyof my Sister's have - having lived nearly my "three scoreyears and ten," before I embraced the Gospel and my mindhad become too weak to grasp the Principles of the Gospelso readily as many others have done, yet the Holy Spirit hasshown one beyond a doubt that this is the Gospel of the Sonof God. Its Principles are very dear to my heart, and Iknow that obedience to the same, will land me safe behindthe Veil - to dwell with those who have gone before.I am not often able to attend meeting, but I havewatched closely, the progress, trials and also the inconsis-tances of our people.
