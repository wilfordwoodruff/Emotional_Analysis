Brother Goalen left London last May (1891) leaving behind his  wife and 5 little children (all under 12) including an infant of 5 months old. Prior to his departure (which he had arranged and carried out very quickly) he faithfully  promised that he would send home regular weekly remittances so to maintain his wife  and family. This pledge he also gave me and he promised me on the word of a Christian that he would redeem this pledge.  For some time he sent home monies, which I can vouch  myself were faithfully expended in purchasing food &amp;c for the family.  About the fall of last year these remittances gradually fell away likewise letters.  The wife finding herself  in this position had to seak what scant labor she could, her own trade as an army  accoutrement maker having fallen off.  The worry of this and seeing her home gradually having to be sold to meet her rent soon told upon her, and, as I feared,  has now so undermined her health, as to utterly prostrate her and incapacitate her  from again following (for a long time at least) any employment, consequently  the family are now  cash was very reluctantly sold to a dealer, viz a piano which fetched only 8 pounds. With care this sum was laid out to pay rent, furing and food for 17 weeks through  the late bitter winter.

I might add that any plea made by Brother Goalen leaving them a good home is no set off  to his silence.  The wages of "Smith's" in your City are well known here and he told his wife that he could easily earn £ 5 a week. half of which sum he would send her.  The only stray news  the wife has gleaned in 6 months was in a letter sent to a relative wherein it was stated he had gone South.

We called at the first house &amp; retired to rest, as we had slept none through the day &amp; night. We arose at 8 oclock took breakfast. I then enquire if their was any priest or religion on the Island. they informed us the centre of the Island, &amp; that there would be preaching to day. In the name of the Lord we hastened to the place. Meeting had commenced. I sent for the deacon to come to the door; I told him we were servents of God, we had a message to the people &amp; wished to be herd. he informed the priest of it. he invited us into the pulpet. After he closed they had a short intermission I then arose &amp; addressed the congregation, and it was amid many peculiar feelings; knowing that it was the first time the voice of an Elder ^of^ the Latter Day Saints, was herd upon one of the Islands of the sea, to set forth the fullness of the gospel. When I closed I gave out several appointments for preaching in different parts of the Island, which was 9 miles long &amp; 2 miles wide containing 800 inhabitants divided into four distrects having four school houses. We presented Mr Newton (this Baptist priest) the Book of Mormon he was mild, did not object to it, said he would read it. In the first fourteen days, we preached nineteen discourses, &amp; the whole Island flocked out to hear. The priest began to see his foundation giving way, he was alarmed &amp; began to cry against us &amp; would not let us have the meeting house.

On Sunday the 3 Islands after I closed a very wealthy, respectable Lady came foreward &amp; wished to be baptised. We repaired to the waters of the Hale lead them down into the sea &amp; baptized them.

We have visited South Fox Island &amp; held five meet- ings with them, they came out by hundreds &amp; filled the homes.

It is almost impossible for the best historian to give an exact description of it. it is a universal mass of ledges &amp; shelves of rocks formed into hills &amp; valleys cut up into necks &amp; points to make room for the coves and harbours that run through &amp; through this Island. One may form some faint idea of it, on learning that it is supposed to be rising of 100 miles round the Island to follow the beach in all its crooks &amp; angles. There is some small parts of this Island under cultivation but it is at the expens of great labour &amp; toil. The hills are timbered with pitch pine and  spruce, the timber &amp; bushes principly grow out of the cracks of the rocks, while the valleys are timbered in the same manner with fir &amp; birch. this people procured their wealth &amp; living wholey by fishing, perhaps their is no people that supply greater quantities of fish than they of this Island. many of them fish at Newfoundland &amp; prepare them for sale here. their is many kinds of fish here around these Island such as Whale, Blackfish, shark, ground shark, Pilot fish, Hors mackerel, stergeon, Holloboat, Salmon, Cod, Pollock, Hake, Haddock, Shad, Mackerel Tom cod, Bass, Alewives Herren, Pohagen, Dolphin Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Scate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Muttonfish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers, Munkfish, Nurs fish, Sunfish, Sword fish, Tharsher, catfish, whiting, scuppog, Tootog, Eyefish, Minney's, cunner, Ling, Eels,  Lobsters, clames, scollops, Mussels, Wrinkles, seal, &amp; Porposes &amp;c &amp;c. &amp; many others not named.
