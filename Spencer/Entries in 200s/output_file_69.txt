 156 THE DESERET NEWS April 11Elder Wilford Woodruff realized his dependence upon the Spirit of God to speak to the edification ofthe people. He spoke of the divine mission which had been laid upon Joseph Smith, to whom had beengiven the keys of the Aaronic and of the Melchizedec priesthoods, by means of which ordinances wereadministered according to the lawof God for the salvation of theliving and of the dead. It was afact that Brigham Young had beenraised up and endowed by Al-mighty God with power to lead thepeople in the ways of life eternaland to organize the covenant peo-ple of God in all things. It was a fact that God had raised up Elders and helps in government to carry on this great Latter-day work. Letus go to with all our might, to work out our own salvation, and to re-deem the generations of the dead.It was our duty to hearken to thecounsels of the servants of God, andto act upon the instructions given to us relative to the United Order. We had been protected by the power of the Most High. Hadthis not been so, the prophets and apostles of the Lord Jesus Christwould be just as completely des-troyed from the earth in this gen-eration as they were anciently. The purposes of the Almighty would come to pass. Judgments would be poured out upon all na-tions. We have not been as faith-ful nor as prompt as we should have been, but where we had here-tofore been slack in the perform-ance of duty we should improve. He concluded by very earnestlyappealing to the Latter-day Saints to be diligent in attending to the necessary temple ordinances for and in behalf of the dead.

 Oct. 10  THE DESERET NEWS.FRIDAY, Oct. 5th, 2 p.m.ELDER W. WOODRUFFSpoke of the greatness of the workin which we, as Elders in Israel, were engaged. Those who weretaking a part in carrying forwardthe kingdom of God, were ordainedbefore the creation of the world toaccomplish this work. There never was a time when the Saints wereso much united in carrying out thepurposes of God as now. We should go to work and build Temples thatthe work of salvation for our deadmight go on. It took just as muchto save a dead man as a living one.The judgments of God awaitedthe wicked, all heaven was watch-ing our movements. They were not perfect without us nor we with-out them. It was the kingdom of God or nothing. If this kingdomdid not prosper, neither did we. We all had a right to the gifts ofthe gospel. Zion would prevail, Zion would arise and put on herbeautiful garments. No one need have any fears about this kingdom; every revelation pertaining to itsbuilding up would be fulfilled tothe very letter. We had every-thing to encourage us. We should pay our tithing and offerings and attend to every known duty and God would be with us henceforth and for ever.ELDER W. WOODRUFFgave an interesting account of thelabors performed in the St. GeorgeTemple from the time of its dedica-tion until he left.He said he would rejoice exceed-ingly to see the time when the Tem-ple in this city and Logan wouldbe completed, so that the saints inthis section of country might havean opportunity of attending totheir baptisms, ordinations forthemselves and their dead, with-out the necessity of traveling sogreat a distance as they now had to do, to St. George. The work inthe Temple there, would be resum-ed on the 20th of this month.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.REMARKSMade by President Wilford Woodruff, at Cache Stake Conference, held at Logan, Sunday Afternoon, Novem-ber 1st, 1891.-[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-I would like to talk a little to the Latter-day Saints who have assembledhere this afternoon, if I can get the faith of the Saints and the Spirit of the Lord to assist me.This morning, before coming tomeeting, I studied with a good deal ofinterest some paintings at Brother Moses Thatcher's—"Christ before Pilate," and "Christ on Calvary." I thought to myself, in looking at them, that the Savior, as Brother Joseph F. Smith bad said, certainly descended below all things. He came down here to earth, was born of woman, in a dispensation appointed of the Father, and tabernacled in the flesh. See him travel from the manger to the cross,onward through blood to the throne of grace appointed unto Him, in poverty and in affliction, never handling any money that we have any account of. Think for a few moments the short time that He labored in the flesh after His appointment by the Father— three years and a half. Look at the suffering that He went through, the labor He performed—the organizationof the Church of God, the appointing of Twelve Apostles, of seventy Apos-tles, and a few disciples, who followed Him during that period.  Then reflect that not only He himself was con-demned and crucified, shedding His blood for the redemption of the world, but every one of His Apostles was put to death for the word of God and testi-mony of Jesus Christ, excepting John the Revelator. They could not kill him, the Lord having appointed him to live; otherwise, he would have been slain with the rest. While looking at the Savior nailed to the cross—a Jew, through the loins of Abraham and David, condemned by the Jews as well as the Gentiles, I thought of our own condition in these mountains. We have passed through sixty years as a people, and why have you got the Presidency with you today? Why have you Apostles living in your midst, walking your streets in freedom, after sixty years? Why do you have upwards of two hundred thousand Latter-day Saints gathered together in these val-leys of the mountains, in the midst of a generation of sixty millions of peo-ple? These are questions which should be answered in the minds of the Lat-ter-day Saints. There is a meaning, brethren and sisters, to all these things. We live in a different dispensation, and under a different order of things, in one sense, to what the Savior and the Apostles did. That was a day of sacrifice. Those holy men who bore the Apostleship in that day were readyto lay down their lives with the Savior, and their lives were short comparedwith the history of the Church of God in our day. They were all slain, withone exception, and God took them to Himself. He also took the Priesthood from the earth, and it remained in the hands of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ until 1829. Long centuries passed away. Millions of human beings were born, dwelt on the earth, died, and went into the spirit world, and not one soul of them, so far as we have any knowledge, had power to go forth among mankind and administer in the ordinances of the Gospel of life and salvation. There were, doubtless, millions of good men, who acted up to the best light that they had. There were such men as John Wesley, Martin Luther, Wickliffe, Zwingli, Melanc-thon, and thousand of others, who came forth in their day and preached the Gospel according to the light which they possessed. But they did not have the power to administer in one ordi-nance which had any force after death. They did not hold the holy Priesthood.Now, in our day and generation, we have arrived at a point in the history of the world when this Priesthood is restored. The Lord raised up Joseph Smith. He came forth in the proper time. He organized a Church. Who was Joseph Smith? Was he a lawyer?  Was he a doctor of divinity? Was he what is called a great man, a learned man? No, he was but a youth; the world would say an illiterate, ignorant youth. He was an unlearned youth in the things of the world. But he was a pure man. He came forth through the lineage of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He was prophesied of by the ancient patriarchs and proph-ets. The Book of Mormon gives his name. Joseph Smith was moved upon by the Holy Ghost, and he was admin-istered unto, in answer to his prayers, by the Father and the Son; and the Father said to him, "This is my be-loved Son, hear ye Him." [##Joseph Smith—History 1:17##] He list-ened strictly to the words of Jesus Christ, and continued to do so until he, like the Savior, was put to death, though he was not crucified, because it was not the custom of the day. I may say that it seemed strange to me at that time why the Prophet and his brother Hyrum were permitted to be taken out of our midst. But Joseph Smith, by commandment of God and by the power and revelations of heaven, was ordained and laid the foundation of this great dispensation and fulness of times. He was brought into the world and ordained to organize this Church of Christ for the last time upon this earth, to prepare it for the coming of the Son of Man. After his death, on

 reflection, I became convinced that he had been ordained to die—to shed his blood as a testimony to this dispensa-tion. But that does not take away the judgment from those who put him to death. "It must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh." [##Matthew 18:7##] As I have said, Joseph Smith was an illit-erate man; but afterwards his teachers and instructors were angels—Apostles who had dwelt in the flesh in the days of Jesus. He was in a condition where he received testi-monies and teachings from men that the world did not receive; and he had power to organize the Church in a manner that all the Christian world combined could not do. Why? Be-cause a man, no matter how wealthy or how learned, cannot give a thing that he does not possess. They had not power to organize this Church, be-cause they did not possess the Priest-hood. But Joseph Smith held that Priesthood and had power to organize the Church?From that day until the present this Church has continued to grow, in themidst of persecution, in the midst of drivings and afflictions, in the midstof death and destruction. Millions of fallen spirits, with millions of thehuman family, have been arrayed against this Church, but they have not had power to destroy it. Why? Be-cause God Almighty has ordained it to stand. The Lord has ordained Zion to be built up. He has proclaimed this through the mouths of inspired men, who spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and today you who are here in this Tabernacle in Logan are testimonies of this before heaven and earth. This is the reason why the Presidency can visit you to-day. It is the reason why Brother Thatcher and Brother Merrill can dwell in your midst, and why the other Apostles can visit you, without being destroyed. Were it not in the dispensation of the Almighty to carry out this principle, you would not have an Apostle to visit you; they would be put to death, the same as those in other dispensations have been. But the Lord has granted this privilege to you Lat-ter-day Saints. I feel to thank God that we live in such a day, when we have power to build up Zion and fulfil the words of the Prophets. The inhabit-ants of the earth have to be warned.  This is the reason why we are here; why Brigham Young, John Taylor, and the Twelve Apostles that have filled their missions have been able to lie down in their beds, surrounded by their wives and children, and give up the ghost, leaving their bodies in the hands of their friends to carry to the tomb. These Apostles and Elders, thousands and thousands of them who are in the flesh in this day, would just as readily lay down their lives as didPeter and the Apostles in the days of Christ, if called upon to do so, for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. But God has ordained otherwise.The Lord has chosen the weak things of the world to lead this people. Joseph Smith was but a young man when he died—not forty years of age. He lived nearly fourteen years after the organi-zation of this Church. PresidentBrigham Young followed him. Who was Brigham Young? He was a painter and glazier. He was a humble man. But the Lord called him to lead this people. You know Brigham Young. You know what he has done, and the spirit that was with him. The Lord was with him, and he continued to lead this people by the power of God and by the revelations of Jesus Christ. He laid the foundation of agreat work in these mountains of Israel. Many strangers who have recently visited us have marvelled and wondered at Salt Lake City being laid out in the manner it was. I have told them that I helped Brigham Young lay out this city in the midst of sage-brush, in 1847. There was not a white man's house then within a thousand miles of us. What was John Taylor? He was a wood turner,and he led the Church for quite a time. Wilford Woodruff was a miller and a farmer; that was about the high-est ambition he ever arrived at, as far as this world was concerned. That is about the way the Lord has chosen these men. Why did he not choose these learned and great men? As I have often said, He could not handle them. God has always chosen the weak things of the earth. He showed Abraham, in his day, the spirits that dwelt in His presence, "and among all these were many of the noble and great ones;" and God said untoAbraham, "These I will make my rulers; . . . and he said unto me, Abraham, thou art one of them, thou wast chosen before thou wast born." [##Abraham 3:22-23##] Abraham stood at the head of Israel in the beginning. He is our great pro-genitor. God raised up the Savior through the loins of Abraham.The Latter-day Saints should notget the idea that the Lord has forsakenHis people, or that He does not reveal His mind and will; because such an idea is not true. The Lord is with us, and has been with us from the begin-ning. This Church has never been led a day except by revelation. And He will never leave it. It matters not who lives or who dies, or who is called to lead this Church, they have got to lead it by the inspiration of Almighty God. If they do not do it that way, they cannot do it at all. The Lord will not fail in these last days, and He will fulfil all that He has promised through His Prophets and Apostles, until Zion arises in its glory, and the Bride, the Lamb's wife, is prepared for the coming of the great Bride-groom.I made some remarks last Sunday atBrigham City upon this same princi-ple—revelation. Read the life of Brigham Young and you can hardlyfind a revelation that he had wherein he said, "Thus saith the Lord;" but the Holy Ghost was with him; He taught by inspiration and by revela-tion; but with one exception he did not give those revelations in the form that Joseph did; for they were not written and given as revelations and command-ments to the Church in the words and name of the Savior. Joseph said "Thus saith the Lord" almost every day of his life in laying the foundationof this work. But those who followed him have not deemed it always ne-cessary to say "Thus saith the Lord;"yet they have led the people by thepower of the Holy Ghost; and if you want to know what that is read the ##Doctrine and Covenants 88:1-6|first six verses of the 88th section of the Bookof Doctrine and Covenants##, where the Lord told Orson Hyde, Luke Johnson, Lyman Johnson and William E. Mc-Lellin to go out and preach the Gospel to the people as they were moved uponby the Holy Ghost:"And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghostshall be Scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord,shall be the word of the Lord, shall bethe voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation."It is by that power that we have led Israel. By that power PresidentYoung presided over and led the Church. By the same power President John Taylor presided over and led the Church. And that is the way I have acted, according to the best of my abil-ity, in that capacity. I do not want the Latter-day Saints to understandthat the Lord is not with us, and thatHe is not giving revelation to us; forHe is giving us revelation, and willgive us revelation until the scene is wound up.I have had some revelations of late,and very important ones to me, and Iwill tell you what the Lord has said to me. Let me bring your minds to whatis termed the manifesto. The Lord has told me by revelation that there aremany members of the Church through-out Zion who are sorely tried in theirhearts because of that manifesto, and also because of the testimony of thePresidency of this Church and the Apostles before the Master in Chance-ry. Since I received that revelation I have heard of many who are tried inthese things, though I had not heardof any before that, particularly. Now,the Lord has commanded me to do onething, and I fulfilled that command-ment at the conference at Brigham City last Sunday, and I will do the same here today. The Lord has told me to ask the Latter-day Saints a question, and He also told me that if they would listen to what I said to them and answer the question put to them, by the spirit and power of God, they would all answer alike, and theywould all believe alike with regard to this matter. The question is this:  Which is the wisest course for the Latter-day Saints to pursue—to con-tinue to attempt to practice plural marriage, with the laws of the nationagainst it and the opposition of sixty millions of people, and at the cost ofthe confiscation and loss of all the Temples, and the stopping of all theordinances therein, both for the livingand the dead, and the imprisonment ofthe First Presidency and Twelve and the heads of families in the Church,and the confiscation of personal prop-erty of the people (all of which ofthemselves would stop the practice), or after doing and suffering what we have through our adherence to this principle to cease the practice and submit to the law, and through doing so leave the Prophets, Apostles and fathers at home, so that they can in-struct the people and attend to the duties of the Church, and also leave the Temples in the hands of the Saints,so that they can attend to the ordi-nances of the Gospel, both for the liv-ing and the dead?The Lord showed me by vision and revelation exactly what would take place if we did not stop this practice. If we had not stopped it, you would

 have had no use for Brother Merrill, for Brother Edlefsen, for Brother Roskelley, for Brother Leishman, or for any of the men in this temple at Logan; for all ordinances would be stopped throughout the land of Zion.  Confusion would reign throughout Israel, and many men would be madeprisoners.  This trouble would have come upon the whole Church, and we should have been compelled to stop the practice.  Now, the question is, whether it should be stopped in thismanner, or in the way the Lord hasmanifested to us, and leave ourProphets and Apostles and fathers free men, and the temples in the hands of the people, so that the dead may be re-deemed.  A large number has already been delivered from the prison housein the spirit world by this people, and shall the work go on or stop?  This isthe question I lay before the Latter-day Saints. You have to judge for your-selves. I want you to answer it for yourselves. I shall not answer it; but I say to you that that is exactly the condition we as a people would have been in had we not taken the course we have.I know there are a good many men, and probably some leading men, in thisChurch who have been tried and feltas though President Woodruff had lost the Spirit of God and was about to apostatize. Now, I want you to under-stand that he has not lost the Spirit, nor is he about to apostatize.  The Lord is with him, and with this people. He has told me exactly what to do, and what the result would be if we did not do it.  I have been called upon by friends outside of the Church and urged to take some steps with regard to this matter.  They knew the course which the Gov-ernment were determined to take.  This feeling has also been manifested more or less by members of the Church.  I saw exactly what would come to pass if there was not something done.  I have had this spirit upon me for a long time.  But I want to say this: I should have let all the temples go out of our hands; I should have gone to prison myself, and let every other man go there, had not the God of heaven commanded me to do what I did do; and when the hour came that I was commanded to do that, it was all clear to me.  I wentbefore the Lord, and I wrote what the Lord told me to write.  I laid it before my brethren—such strong men as Brother Geo. Q. Cannon, Brother Jos. F. Smith, and the Twelve Apostles.  I might as well undertake to turn an army with banners out of its course asto turn them out of a course that theyconsidered to be right.  These men agreed with me, and ten thousand Latter-day Saints also agreed with me.  Why? Because they were moved upon by the Spirit of God and by the revela-tions of Jesus Christ to do it.I leave this with you, for you to con-template and consider.  The Lord isat work with us.  He is doing things here that you do not comprehend. Make these matters a subject of prayer. Do not worry; do not feel bad about them.I rejoice that God has revealed to us the gospel.  I rejoice I live in a day and generation when we have the Church of God on the earth.  Wehave had prophets and apostles among us.  They have worked here in the flesh and saved many souls. They have died and gone to the spirit world. Joseph Smith holds the keys of this dispensation.  He will hold them to the endless ages of eternity, no matter who may lead the Church after him.  The Lord has given us power to come here and build temples.  We have three temples erected in these moun-tains, and many of the dead have been redeemed in them, and they will havea part in the first resurrection. There-fore, we ought to be thankful to theLord. We want to continue in these temples. We want them to be oc-cupied by the Latter-day Saints.  We want our brethren and sisters to continue to go there and redeem the dead and bless the living. The Lord will take care of you and your families. He will take care of Zion, and of this generation, and He will fulfil all that He has said.I say, God bless you.  And He will bless you if you will hearken to Hiscounsels.I want the Latter-day Saints to stop murmuring and complaining at theprovidence of God. Trust in God.  Do your duty. Remember your prayers. Get faith in the Lord, and take hold and build up Zion. All will be right.  The Lord is going to visit His people, and He is going tocut His work short in righteousness, lest no flesh should be saved.  I say to you, watch the signs of the times, and prepare yourselves for that which is to come. God bless you. Amen. 
 Salt Lake City Jan. 27th [18]92President Wilford Woodruff & CounselorsDear Brethern—Having arrivedat the conclusion that I am best adapted to the study of medicene and also having a natural inclinationand love for the same, I amd decided to pursue a coursein a medical school if it be pleasing to the will ofHim who rules all things. But as I have lately retured from a two years and eight monthsmission to Turkey, which cost me several hund-red dollars, I have not the ready means to start schooll now as I would like. There is a medical school in Louisville, Ky that opens onFeby 1st at which I would like to take my firstyears course. It will coust me about $30000/100 for this year. Although I have some realty at Logan, I cannot well despose of it or give it as security atpresant without considerable ^loss^ or expense. If you can assist me to^in^ getting about $300.00/100 for six or eightmonths at reasonable inte^r^est, it would greatly obligeme. Previous to going on my mission, I was book-keeping and clerking for W. C. Morris, who is nowdeceased. At presant I have no work and would

 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIORUNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEYWASHINGTON, D. C. March 4, 1892.To the President of the Church of the Latter-Day SaintsSalt Lake City, Utah.Dear sir:A letter has come to this office from Prof. A. Krassnoffof the University of Kharkof, Russia, containing the followinginquiry:"Can you not tell me whether there may be got anywhere inWashington plans of the famous "Tabernacle" in Salt Lake City,Utah, that is to say, plans or an exact description of thiswondrously fine hall. If these may be bought anywhere, pleasewrite me where and when it may be done, and if it costs no morethan $50, I will at once send money there in order to get theplans. It is intended to have a similar building erected inMoscow, and I hope that you as an American will be pleased tosee an American invention on Russian soil."Mr. Krassnoff is a distingished scientist whose works onplant geography have a wide reputation. He attended the Inter-national Congress of Geologists in Washington last August, andafterward took part in the great geological excursion throughthe West. It was on that occasion that the Tabernacle attractedhis attention.

Ido not know what part ofOgden she lives in, but think she can be found upon little enquiry.  Bishop West has a son, JosephWest, residing there who is well known. The Standard office peoplewould doubtless give directions where to find him and he wouldgive directions.Also, I heard it often spokenof in Nauvoo that PrescillaMogrege was also another of the plural wives of William Smith.After William Smith's apostacy she was married in St. Louis to anoutsider by the name of Lowrey.

 come so weak and emancipated. I began, at last, to study mycondition and it is only recently Ithat I realized the terriblestate of my health. My bowels had become hardened & stiffthrough the effects of so much purging medicines which I had takento get them to move, until they lost all power & completely refusedto act. This was about two months ago & very fortunately for meI at last obtained a little relief. By subjecting myself tothe most rigid diet, in connection with a little medicine toaid digestion I have been improving a little, but it is veryslow work. I have become so weak, having lost nearly 15 poundsof flesh, that at present a walk of over a mile at a timealmost exhausts me. This in brief is the true condition ofmy health at the present time and I thought it wise thatyou should become acquainted with these circumstances, sothat you will be able to judge wisely & justly, whether or notI could perform the labors required of a missionary, or evenpartake of the hospitality of the people among whom I mightbe sent. I do not state the above with the least desire to shirkor avoid the duty which is required of me. Dear Brethern, sucha desire is fartherest from my heart. I have always tried toperform every duty & responsibility placed upon me & I have

 THE DESERET NEWS.REMARKSBy Elder Wilford Woodruff, delivered in the Tabernacle, G. S. L. City, Oct. 7th, 1867.REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.Yesterday morning when I came intothis tabernacle it was some little timebefore I could tell whether what I saw was in vision, or whether it was realand literal; but I soon became thorough-ly convinced that I was in the taberna-cle of the Lord built here in the moun-tains, and saw before me some ten or twelve thousand Latter-day Saints.I have been interested in the counselsand instructions which we have receiv-ed here in this house, and when we, aselders, have texts given us to preachfrom I feel that we, in a measure, arebound to confine ourselves to those texts. In the few remarks that I may make I wish to speak upon them.The first text was the emigration. We have been gathered together by the gos-pel of Jesus Christ. We have partaken of its blessings, and as far as lies in ourpower we should extend those blessingsto our brethren and sisters abroad. It is our duty to do all we can to assist inemigrating the poor from the nations of the earth, for the Lord requires it at our hands.The second text was the education of our children. The subject was address-ed to mothers; it applies also to thefathers. This is a subject of vast im-portance to the Latter-day Saints. If any one were to ask me when the edu-cation of our children begins; I will not tell you what you believe, but I will tell you what I believe -- I believe that edu-cation begins when the spirit of life en-ters the tabernacle of the child. Thatis the way I view it. If the mother hasthe spirit of God upon her, when sheprays and calls upon the Lord for his blessing, I believe that that power and spirit affects her child, and will do sountil the day of its birth, and will affectit from that time henceforth and forev-er. While the mother lives her influ-ence, example, and teachings will affecther child through life. If she teachesher child virtue, honesty and righteous principles, if she teaches him to pray,these teachings will have their effect upon him through life. If parents know the effect of their example on their chil-dren, we should many times do very different from what we do. When a father gives counsel to is wives and children about anything he desires doneabout his place, his orchard, his garden or farm, and the wife teaches her chil-dren to obey their father, that has its effect upon the children -- they worktogether. But let the mother, as soon as the father's back is turned say to herchildren "your father is gone and you may go and pick those apples or grapes,or you may go and gather this, that and the other, your father will not know anything about it, and it will be all right," she sets a very bad example be-fore her children, she teaches them to steal and to take an evil course; but let the mother carry out the counsels of the father, and they both work together inteaching their children righteous prin-ciples, and their children will grow up having learned to obey their parents.Mothers in Israel should remember that,unless they do their best to carry outthe counsels of the head of the family,they set a bad example before the chil-dren and take a course that the Lord will not approve and bless; but let them be one with their husbands in carrying out his counsels and the Lord will blessthem and their children. Many a time,when in the vision of my mind, I con-template the great duties and responsi-bilities that will yet rest on the rising generation among the Latter-day Saints, I feel that we as parents are tooslow in our duties towards our children.No better legacy can we bestow upon them than to teach them every truth which we ourselves are in possession of;then they will honor us, honor the priesthood, magnify their callings, andcarry out the great purposes of our God.The next subject referred to by thePresident was the call for a certain number of teams to haul rock for the temple. I need not say much in relation to this. The people have built this tabernacle, and we have gotto build the temple. If the inhabitants of Zion felt the lack, weight and bless-ings of the most high God that are with-in their reach, there is not a man in Is-rael who would refuse for one moment to do anything in his power to furtherthe building of the temple. God designsto bestow the blessings of heaven uponthe Latter-day Saints. There are veryfew in Israel who have received the ful-ness of the blessings of the kingdom ofGod, while there are thousands, proba-bly, who are worthy to receive them. We must have a temple in order to bes-tow these blessings.The next text was some young men were called to go south to strengthen the southern country. This is all right,they may just as well go there as any-where else. When we received thisgospel we entered into covenant to obey the Lord. We then received a mission that will never close as long as we dwell in the flesh whether we go east,west, north or south. We are fulfill-ing that mission whether we go to Eng-land or to Dixie; it is all the same as long as we are under the dictation of the holy priesthood. Then let us fulfil all missions and comply with all calls made upon us.The next pleasing text given was for the young men and maidens to marry.I want to say a few words to the youngladies. A great many men are called south. They are required by the Holy Priesthood to marry. Now, when theseyoung men ask you young ladies to marry them, do not ask them how rich they are, or how much gold and silverthey have; but let the question with you be, are they good, are they virtuous, are they Latter-day Saints, are they obey-ing counsel and trying to do what isrequired of them. If they are doing this, you should not require the youngmen in Israel to be worth ten thousand dollars in gold, nor a dozen carriages; and any father or mother who throws obstacles in the way of the young folksbeing married through such considera-tions does not do right. Let them ful-fil the commandments. You may ask them if they have three straw beds allbut the ticks, and if the young menpossess them, then marry them.The next text was to lay up yourwheat. I do not want to say muchabout this. The army of our God thathas gone through this territory and which is about to visit the nations ofthe earth will soon teach us this lesson. We certainly should begin to feel the importance of carrying out this counsel. It has been given to us for years andyears past and gone.The next text presented by President Young was upon the necessity of learn-ing and observing the laws of health. I may say this is of vast importance. I do not feel that I am particularlyqualified to teach you on this principle;but I am satisfied that if we will keepthe Word of Wisdom, be temperate in our lives and be faithful before the Lord that we shall have more of the Spirit of the Lord, and may considerably pro-long our lives. It is a maxim with President Young -- and I believe it istrue -- that a man should not teach what he does not practice. We are intempe-rate in many things. We are intem-perate in labor as well as many other things. I have been intemperate in this myself. I have seen so much to do in the world, so much around me thatI felt ought to be done to save things from going to waste, that many times Ihave felt that I have done wrong in laboring so hard. I do not know, how-ever, but that it is better to wear outthan to rust out. I would far sooner see a man labor hard than see him a lazyvagabond depending upon the exertionsof others for his livelihood. The Word of Wisdom covers a great deal of ground and I am satisfied that the day willcome when we shall change in a great many things in our manner of life, and shall more properly appreciate teach-ings on this subject than we do now.The last text given was for the Eldersto preach only what they know. This is good counsel, and as long as we keepwithin the bounds of this rule, we willalways be right. I never had more of the spirit of God in my life than when teaching the first principles of thegospel, and bearing testimony to the in-habitants of the earth that Joseph Smith was a true Prophet of God, thatthe Book of Mormon was true, and that the first principles of the gospel, as re-vealed through him, were the plan of life and salvation. Whenever we, the Elders of Israel, go beyond these limits we are in the swamp, we do not know where we are nor where we are going; but as long as we keep within the limits of our knowledge -- within what we know and have been taught us by theHoly Spirit, we are safe and we will besaved with full salvation, even so: Amen.

 Mooers, N. Y. Aug. 17, 1896.Mr. Wilford Woodruff.President Of The Morman Church.Dear Sir:I am assisting a relative in looking up the genealogy of the Presby or Presbrey family. Years before I was born, during the Mormon excitement inthe East, two of my fathers sisters in New Hampshire married Mormons andwent West, while the Mormans were at Nauvoo ILL. Mary Ann Presby marriedWilliam M. Parker in New Hampshire. I think they had been married a num-ber of years before they joined the Mormon church. Mary Ann Presby wasborn in Lyman N. H. in 1810. She died in Chicago or Nauvoo Ill in 1845, notlong, I think, after she and her husband went West with the Mormons.Mr. and Mrs. Parker had children before they joined the Mormon church.There is now lying before me a letter which William M. Parker wrote to my father, dated at Chicago Feb. 7, 1845, and he signs his name as an Elderin the Mormon chucrch. Will you please be so kind as to have some onelook up your records and inform me about the family of William M. Parker.Can you inform me about his children by my aunt, giving their names,who they married, &c. Will you please give me the names and addresses ofone or two of their decendants from whom I might be most likely to getthe genealogical information which I need. Please also inform me aboutthe subsequent history of William M. Parker, date of his death &c. My father also had a younger sister, Colista Presby, who joined the Mormonchurch and went West soon after her sister above named did. We know nothi[ng]of her subsequent history. Can you tell me who she may have married, andanything about her decendants, if she has any. Any information from yourrecords, or which you may help me to obtain from decendants of the auntsI have referred to will be very thankfully received. Please let me hearfrom you as soon as convenient. I inclose a stamp fop [for] reply.Very Truly Yours.J. W. Presby.REV. J. W. PRESBY, PH. D.PASTOR OF THEMETHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH,MOOERS, N. Y.

I now learn from him that he has arranged to go sometime this fall or winter, if desired, and the business interests of our firm, just at this time,being such, we both being active in the business, that it wouldbe almost impossible for both of us to be away at the same time,and father does not feel able to assume the whole managment andcontrol of the business alone, I therefore feel that I willhave to ask for a postponement.I have talked the matter over with Father and allinterested and we have concluded that either Frank J. or myselfcan and will respond now and if there is any preference I thinkthat it can be complied with, the one remaining will go as soonafter the other returns as desirable.I trust that the above will meet with your approval, andremain,Your Brother in the Gospel.Sidney O. StevensI can heartily endorse this letter and will say that I would recommend Frank J. to go now in place of Sidney O. they are both good men and in full fellowshipif both are called to go now the business would suffervery much.Respectfully your bro. in the GospelRobert McQuarrie Bishop2nd Ward Ogdenover--
