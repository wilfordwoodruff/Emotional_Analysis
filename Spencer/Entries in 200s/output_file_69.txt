 156 THE DESERET NEWS April 11    Elder Wilford Woodruff realized   his dependence upon the Spirit of   God to speak to the edification of  the people. He spoke of the divine   mission which had been laid upon   Joseph Smith, to whom had been  given the keys of the Aaronic and   of the Melchizedec priesthoods, by   means of which ordinances were  administered according to the law  of God for the salvation of the  living and of the dead. It was a  fact that Brigham Young had been  raised up and endowed by Al-  mighty God with power to lead the  people in the ways of life eternal  and to organize the covenant peo-  ple of God in all things. It was a   fact that God had raised up Elders   and helps in government to carry   on this great Latter-day work. Let  us go to with all our might, to work   out our own salvation, and to re-  deem the generations of the dead.  It was our duty to hearken to the  counsels of the servants of God, and  to act upon the instructions given   to us relative to the United   Order. We had been protected by   the power of the Most High. Had  this not been so, the prophets and   apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ  would be just as completely des-  troyed from the earth in this gen-  eration as they were anciently.   The purposes of the Almighty   would come to pass. Judgments   would be poured out upon all na-  tions. We have not been as faith-  ful nor as prompt as we should   have been, but where we had here-  tofore been slack in the perform-  ance of duty we should improve.   He concluded by very earnestly  appealing to the Latter-day Saints   to be diligent in attending to the   necessary temple ordinances for   and in behalf of the dead.

 Oct. 10  THE DESERET NEWS.    FRIDAY, Oct. 5th, 2 p.m.    ELDER W. WOODRUFF  Spoke of the greatness of the work  in which we, as Elders in Israel,   were engaged. Those who were  taking a part in carrying forward  the kingdom of God, were ordained  before the creation of the world to  accomplish this work. There never   was a time when the Saints were  so much united in carrying out the  purposes of God as now. We should   go to work and build Temples that  the work of salvation for our dead  might go on. It took just as much  to save a dead man as a living one.    The judgments of God awaited  the wicked, all heaven was watch-  ing our movements. They were   not perfect without us nor we with-  out them. It was the kingdom of   God or nothing. If this kingdom  did not prosper, neither did we.   We all had a right to the gifts of  the gospel. Zion would prevail,   Zion would arise and put on her  beautiful garments. No one need   have any fears about this kingdom;   every revelation pertaining to its  building up would be fulfilled to  the very letter. We had every-  thing to encourage us. We should   pay our tithing and offerings and   attend to every known duty and   God would be with us henceforth   and for ever.    ELDER W. WOODRUFF  gave an interesting account of the  labors performed in the St. George  Temple from the time of its dedica-  tion until he left.    He said he would rejoice exceed-  ingly to see the time when the Tem-  ple in this city and Logan would  be completed, so that the saints in  this section of country might have  an opportunity of attending to  their baptisms, ordinations for  themselves and their dead, with-  out the necessity of traveling so  great a distance as they now had   to do, to St. George. The work in  the Temple there, would be resum-  ed on the 20th of this month.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    REMARKS    Made by President Wilford Woodruff,   at Cache Stake Conference, held at   Logan, Sunday Afternoon, Novem-  ber 1st, 1891.    -[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-    I would like to talk a little to the   Latter-day Saints who have assembled  here this afternoon, if I can get the   faith of the Saints and the Spirit of the   Lord to assist me.    This morning, before coming to  meeting, I studied with a good deal of  interest some paintings at Brother   Moses Thatcher's—"Christ before   Pilate," and "Christ on Calvary." I   thought to myself, in looking at them,   that the Savior, as Brother Joseph F.   Smith bad said, certainly descended   below all things. He came down   here to earth, was born of woman, in   a dispensation appointed of the Father,   and tabernacled in the flesh. See him   travel from the manger to the cross,  onward through blood to the throne of   grace appointed unto Him, in poverty   and in affliction, never handling any   money that we have any account of.   Think for a few moments the short   time that He labored in the flesh   after His appointment by the Father—   three years and a half. Look at the   suffering that He went through, the   labor He performed—the organization  of the Church of God, the appointing   of Twelve Apostles, of seventy Apos-  tles, and a few disciples, who followed   Him during that period.  Then reflect   that not only He himself was con-  demned and crucified, shedding His   blood for the redemption of the world,   but every one of His Apostles was put   to death for the word of God and testi-  mony of Jesus Christ, excepting John   the Revelator. They could not kill   him, the Lord having appointed him   to live; otherwise, he would have been   slain with the rest. While looking at   the Savior nailed to the cross—a Jew,   through the loins of Abraham and   David, condemned by the Jews as well   as the Gentiles, I thought of our own   condition in these mountains. We have   passed through sixty years as a people,   and why have you got the Presidency   with you today? Why have you   Apostles living in your midst, walking   your streets in freedom, after sixty   years? Why do you have upwards of   two hundred thousand Latter-day   Saints gathered together in these val-  leys of the mountains, in the midst of   a generation of sixty millions of peo-  ple? These are questions which should   be answered in the minds of the Lat-  ter-day Saints. There is a meaning,   brethren and sisters, to all these things.   We live in a different dispensation,   and under a different order of things,   in one sense, to what the Savior and   the Apostles did. That was a day of   sacrifice. Those holy men who bore   the Apostleship in that day were ready  to lay down their lives with the Savior,   and their lives were short compared  with the history of the Church of God   in our day. They were all slain, with  one exception, and God took them to   Himself. He also took the Priesthood   from the earth, and it remained in the   hands of God the Father and His Son   Jesus Christ until 1829. Long centuries   passed away. Millions of human   beings were born, dwelt on the earth,   died, and went into the spirit world, and   not one soul of them, so far as we   have any knowledge, had power to go   forth among mankind and administer   in the ordinances of the Gospel of life   and salvation. There were, doubtless,   millions of good men, who acted up to   the best light that they had. There   were such men as John Wesley, Martin   Luther, Wickliffe, Zwingli, Melanc-  thon, and thousand of others, who   came forth in their day and preached   the Gospel according to the light which   they possessed. But they did not have   the power to administer in one ordi-  nance which had any force after death.   They did not hold the holy Priesthood.    Now, in our day and generation, we   have arrived at a point in the history   of the world when this Priesthood is   restored. The Lord raised up Joseph   Smith. He came forth in the proper   time. He organized a Church. Who   was Joseph Smith? Was he a lawyer?    Was he a doctor of divinity? Was he   what is called a great man, a learned   man? No, he was but a youth; the   world would say an illiterate, ignorant   youth. He was an unlearned youth   in the things of the world. But he was   a pure man. He came forth through   the lineage of Abraham, Isaac and   Jacob. He was prophesied of by   the ancient patriarchs and proph-  ets. The Book of Mormon gives his   name. Joseph Smith was moved upon   by the Holy Ghost, and he was admin-  istered unto, in answer to his prayers,   by the Father and the Son; and the   Father said to him, "This is my be-  loved Son, hear ye Him." [##Joseph Smith—History 1:17##] He list-  ened strictly to the words of Jesus   Christ, and continued to do so until   he, like the Savior, was put to death,   though he was not crucified, because it   was not the custom of the day. I may   say that it seemed strange to me at that   time why the Prophet and his brother   Hyrum were permitted to be taken out   of our midst. But Joseph Smith, by   commandment of God and by the   power and revelations of heaven, was   ordained and laid the foundation of   this great dispensation and fulness of   times. He was brought into the world   and ordained to organize this Church   of Christ for the last time upon this   earth, to prepare it for the coming of   the Son of Man. After his death, on

 reflection, I became convinced that he   had been ordained to die—to shed his   blood as a testimony to this dispensa-  tion. But that does not take away the   judgment from those who put him to   death. "It must needs be that offenses   come; but woe to that man by whom   the offense cometh." [##Matthew 18:7##] As I have   said, Joseph Smith was an illit-  erate man; but afterwards his   teachers and instructors were   angels—Apostles who had dwelt in the   flesh in the days of Jesus. He was in   a condition where he received testi-  monies and teachings from men that   the world did not receive; and he had   power to organize the Church in a   manner that all the Christian world   combined could not do. Why? Be-  cause a man, no matter how wealthy   or how learned, cannot give a thing   that he does not possess. They had   not power to organize this Church, be-  cause they did not possess the Priest-  hood. But Joseph Smith held that   Priesthood and had power to organize   the Church?    From that day until the present this   Church has continued to grow, in the  midst of persecution, in the midst of   drivings and afflictions, in the midst  of death and destruction. Millions of   fallen spirits, with millions of the  human family, have been arrayed   against this Church, but they have not   had power to destroy it. Why? Be-  cause God Almighty has ordained it   to stand. The Lord has ordained   Zion to be built up. He has proclaimed   this through the mouths of inspired   men, who spake as they were moved   upon by the Holy Ghost; and today   you who are here in this Tabernacle in   Logan are testimonies of this before   heaven and earth. This is the reason   why the Presidency can visit you to-  day. It is the reason why Brother   Thatcher and Brother Merrill can   dwell in your midst, and why the   other Apostles can visit you, without   being destroyed. Were it not in the   dispensation of the Almighty to carry   out this principle, you would not have   an Apostle to visit you; they would be   put to death, the same as those in other   dispensations have been. But the Lord   has granted this privilege to you Lat-  ter-day Saints. I feel to thank God   that we live in such a day, when we   have power to build up Zion and fulfil   the words of the Prophets. The inhabit-  ants of the earth have to be warned.    This is the reason why we are here;   why Brigham Young, John Taylor,   and the Twelve Apostles that have   filled their missions have been able to   lie down in their beds, surrounded by   their wives and children, and give up   the ghost, leaving their bodies in the   hands of their friends to carry to the   tomb. These Apostles and Elders,   thousands and thousands of them who   are in the flesh in this day, would just   as readily lay down their lives as did  Peter and the Apostles in the days of   Christ, if called upon to do so, for the   word of God and the testimony of   Jesus Christ. But God has ordained   otherwise.    The Lord has chosen the weak things   of the world to lead this people. Joseph   Smith was but a young man when he   died—not forty years of age. He lived   nearly fourteen years after the organi-  zation of this Church. President  Brigham Young followed him. Who   was Brigham Young? He was a   painter and glazier. He was a humble   man. But the Lord called him to lead   this people. You know Brigham   Young. You know what he has done,   and the spirit that was with him. The   Lord was with him, and he continued   to lead this people by the power of   God and by the revelations of Jesus   Christ. He laid the foundation of a  great work in these mountains of   Israel. Many strangers who have   recently visited us have marvelled and   wondered at Salt Lake City being laid   out in the manner it was. I have told   them that I helped Brigham Young   lay out this city in the midst of sage-  brush, in 1847. There was not a   white man's house then within a   thousand miles of us. What was   John Taylor? He was a wood turner,  and he led the Church for quite a   time. Wilford Woodruff was a miller   and a farmer; that was about the high-  est ambition he ever arrived at, as far   as this world was concerned. That is   about the way the Lord has chosen   these men. Why did he not choose   these learned and great men? As I   have often said, He could not handle   them. God has always chosen the   weak things of the earth. He showed   Abraham, in his day, the spirits that   dwelt in His presence, "and among all   these were many of the noble and   great ones;" and God said unto  Abraham, "These I will make my   rulers; . . . and he said unto me,   Abraham, thou art one of them, thou   wast chosen before thou wast born." [##Abraham 3:22-23##]   Abraham stood at the head of Israel in   the beginning. He is our great pro-  genitor. God raised up the Savior   through the loins of Abraham.    The Latter-day Saints should not  get the idea that the Lord has forsaken  His people, or that He does not reveal   His mind and will; because such an   idea is not true. The Lord is with us,   and has been with us from the begin-  ning. This Church has never been   led a day except by revelation. And   He will never leave it. It matters not   who lives or who dies, or who is called   to lead this Church, they have got to   lead it by the inspiration of Almighty   God. If they do not do it that way,   they cannot do it at all. The Lord   will not fail in these last days, and He   will fulfil all that He has promised   through His Prophets and Apostles,   until Zion arises in its glory, and the   Bride, the Lamb's wife, is prepared   for the coming of the great Bride-  groom.    I made some remarks last Sunday at  Brigham City upon this same princi-  ple—revelation. Read the life of   Brigham Young and you can hardly  find a revelation that he had wherein   he said, "Thus saith the Lord;" but   the Holy Ghost was with him; He   taught by inspiration and by revela-  tion; but with one exception he did not   give those revelations in the form that   Joseph did; for they were not written   and given as revelations and command-  ments to the Church in the words and   name of the Savior. Joseph said   "Thus saith the Lord" almost every   day of his life in laying the foundation  of this work. But those who followed   him have not deemed it always ne-  cessary to say "Thus saith the Lord;"  yet they have led the people by the  power of the Holy Ghost; and if you   want to know what that is read the ##Doctrine and Covenants 88:1-6|first   six verses of the 88th section of the Book  of Doctrine and Covenants##, where the   Lord told Orson Hyde, Luke Johnson,   Lyman Johnson and William E. Mc-  Lellin to go out and preach the Gospel   to the people as they were moved upon  by the Holy Ghost:    "And whatsoever they shall speak   when moved upon by the Holy Ghost  shall be Scripture, shall be the will of the   Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord,  shall be the word of the Lord, shall be  the voice of the Lord, and the power of   God unto salvation."    It is by that power that we have led   Israel. By that power President  Young presided over and led the   Church. By the same power President   John Taylor presided over and led the   Church. And that is the way I have   acted, according to the best of my abil-  ity, in that capacity. I do not want   the Latter-day Saints to understand  that the Lord is not with us, and that  He is not giving revelation to us; for  He is giving us revelation, and will  give us revelation until the scene is   wound up.    I have had some revelations of late,  and very important ones to me, and I  will tell you what the Lord has said to   me. Let me bring your minds to what  is termed the manifesto. The Lord has   told me by revelation that there are  many members of the Church through-  out Zion who are sorely tried in their  hearts because of that manifesto, and   also because of the testimony of the  Presidency of this Church and the   Apostles before the Master in Chance-  ry. Since I received that revelation I   have heard of many who are tried in  these things, though I had not heard  of any before that, particularly. Now,  the Lord has commanded me to do one  thing, and I fulfilled that command-  ment at the conference at Brigham   City last Sunday, and I will do the   same here today. The Lord has told   me to ask the Latter-day Saints a   question, and He also told me that if   they would listen to what I said to   them and answer the question put to   them, by the spirit and power of God,   they would all answer alike, and they  would all believe alike with regard to   this matter. The question is this:    Which is the wisest course for the   Latter-day Saints to pursue—to con-  tinue to attempt to practice plural   marriage, with the laws of the nation  against it and the opposition of sixty   millions of people, and at the cost of  the confiscation and loss of all the   Temples, and the stopping of all the  ordinances therein, both for the living  and the dead, and the imprisonment of  the First Presidency and Twelve and   the heads of families in the Church,  and the confiscation of personal prop-  erty of the people (all of which of  themselves would stop the practice),   or after doing and suffering what we   have through our adherence to this   principle to cease the practice and   submit to the law, and through doing   so leave the Prophets, Apostles and   fathers at home, so that they can in-  struct the people and attend to the   duties of the Church, and also leave   the Temples in the hands of the Saints,  so that they can attend to the ordi-  nances of the Gospel, both for the liv-  ing and the dead?

 David A.

I have talked freely with the  owners of the property about the matter  and we have firmly resolved, that we  cannot do other wise, than to comply  with the bargain made about two  years ago.    We have talked with the Co.'s, agent  Bro Mac. and Apostle Teasdale about  the matter, they fully endorse our  desision, and said they saw no  reason why the transfer should not be  made and I recieve a clear title   
 family, but it has been a kind  of uphill work, but I am thankful  to our heavenly Father, we have  not suffered hunger nor cold to  a very great extent.  I have the  Post Office at this place, but the  means that I receive from that are  very meager, and barely enough  to support my family with, and  having to go around on my knees  I am not fitted for manuel  Labor. But at this writing I have  before me a catalogue of Artificial  Limbs, showing my amputation  exactly, and the kind of Limb I  can get to enable me to walk up-  right and do almost any kind  of manuel Labor, the price of the  Limbs are $50.00/100 each, and if  I had them I am satisfied I could  get along better than I am now doing  and be able to assist in building  up these Holy Temples to the

 have had no use for Brother Merrill,   for Brother Edlefsen, for Brother   Roskelley, for Brother Leishman, or for   any of the men in this temple at   Logan; for all ordinances would be   stopped throughout the land of Zion.    Confusion would reign throughout   Israel, and many men would be made  prisoners.  This trouble would have   come upon the whole Church, and we   should have been compelled to stop the   practice.  Now, the question is,   whether it should be stopped in this  manner, or in the way the Lord has  manifested to us, and leave our  Prophets and Apostles and fathers free   men, and the temples in the hands of   the people, so that the dead may be re-  deemed.  A large number has already   been delivered from the prison house  in the spirit world by this people, and   shall the work go on or stop?  This is  the question I lay before the Latter-day   Saints. You have to judge for your-  selves. I want you to answer it for   yourselves. I shall not answer it; but   I say to you that that is exactly the   condition we as a people would have   been in had we not taken the course we   have.    I know there are a good many men,   and probably some leading men, in this  Church who have been tried and felt  as though President Woodruff had lost   the Spirit of God and was about to   apostatize. Now, I want you to under-  stand that he has not lost the Spirit,   nor is he about to apostatize.  The Lord   is with him, and with this people. He   has told me exactly what to do, and   what the result would be if we did not   do it.  I have been called upon by friends   outside of the Church and urged to take   some steps with regard to this matter.    They knew the course which the Gov-  ernment were determined to take.  This   feeling has also been manifested more   or less by members of the Church.  I   saw exactly what would come to pass   if there was not something done.  I   have had this spirit upon me   for a long time.  But I want   to say this: I should have let   all the temples go out of our hands; I   should have gone to prison myself, and   let every other man go there, had   not the God of heaven commanded me   to do what I did do; and when the   hour came that I was commanded to   do that, it was all clear to me.  I went  before the Lord, and I wrote what the   Lord told me to write.  I laid it before   my brethren—such strong men as   Brother Geo. Q. Cannon, Brother Jos.   F. Smith, and the Twelve Apostles.  I   might as well undertake to turn an   army with banners out of its course as  to turn them out of a course that they  considered to be right.  These men   agreed with me, and ten thousand   Latter-day Saints also agreed with me.    Why? Because they were moved upon   by the Spirit of God and by the revela-  tions of Jesus Christ to do it.    I leave this with you, for you to con-  template and consider.  The Lord is  at work with us.  He is doing things   here that you do not comprehend.   Make these matters a subject of   prayer. Do not worry; do not feel bad   about them.    I rejoice that God has revealed to us   the gospel.  I rejoice I live in a day   and generation when we have the   Church of God on the earth.  We  have had prophets and apostles among   us.  They have worked here in the   flesh and saved many souls. They   have died and gone to the spirit world.   Joseph Smith holds the keys of this   dispensation.  He will hold them to   the endless ages of eternity, no matter   who may lead the Church after him.    The Lord has given us power to come   here and build temples.  We have   three temples erected in these moun-  tains, and many of the dead have been   redeemed in them, and they will have  a part in the first resurrection. There-  fore, we ought to be thankful to the  Lord. We want to continue in these   temples. We want them to be oc-  cupied by the Latter-day Saints.    We want our brethren and sisters to   continue to go there and redeem the   dead and bless the living. The Lord   will take care of you and your families.   He will take care of Zion, and of this   generation, and He will fulfil all that   He has said.    I say, God bless you.  And He will   bless you if you will hearken to His  counsels.    I want the Latter-day Saints to stop   murmuring and complaining at the  providence of God. Trust in God.    Do your duty. Remember your   prayers. Get faith in the Lord, and   take hold and build up Zion. All   will be right.  The Lord is going to   visit His people, and He is going to  cut His work short in righteousness,   lest no flesh should be saved.  I say to   you, watch the signs of the times, and   prepare yourselves for that which is to   come. God bless you. Amen. 
 Salt Lake City Jan. 27th [18]92    President Wilford Woodruff & Counselors    Dear Brethern—Having arrived  at the conclusion that I am best adapted to the   study of medicene and also having a natural inclination  and love for the same, I amd decided to pursue a course  in a medical school if it be pleasing to the will of  Him who rules all things. But as I have lately   retured from a two years and eight months  mission to Turkey, which cost me several hund-  red dollars, I have not the ready means to   start schooll now as I would like. There is a   medical school in Louisville, Ky that opens on  Feby 1st at which I would like to take my first  years course. It will coust me about $30000/100 for this   year. Although I have some realty at Logan, I   cannot well despose of it or give it as security at  presant without considerable ^loss^ or expense. If you can   assist me to^in^ getting about $300.00/100 for six or eight  months at reasonable inte^r^est, it would greatly oblige  me. Previous to going on my mission, I was book-  keeping and clerking for W. C. Morris, who is now  deceased. At presant I have no work and would

 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR  UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY    WASHINGTON, D. C. March 4, 1892.    To the President of the Church of the Latter-Day Saints  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear sir:    A letter has come to this office from Prof. A. Krassnoff  of the University of Kharkof, Russia, containing the following  inquiry:    "Can you not tell me whether there may be got anywhere in  Washington plans of the famous "Tabernacle" in Salt Lake City,  Utah, that is to say, plans or an exact description of this  wondrously fine hall. If these may be bought anywhere, please  write me where and when it may be done, and if it costs no more  than $50, I will at once send money there in order to get the  plans. It is intended to have a similar building erected in  Moscow, and I hope that you as an American will be pleased to  see an American invention on Russian soil."    Mr. Krassnoff is a distingished scientist whose works on  plant geography have a wide reputation. He attended the Inter-  national Congress of Geologists in Washington last August, and  afterward took part in the great geological excursion through  the West. It was on that occasion that the Tabernacle attracted  his attention. 
 most High, more so than I am  able to do at present, for it makes  me feel as if I was on the outside  when there are donations called and  my name cannot be found among  the donors. Therefore Bro. Woodruff  I write asking you as the Trustee  in Trust for the Church, if you  could help me to procure a pair  of these Artificial Limbs, so that  I can try to be along with the rest  of my Brethren in rolling on this great  work in these Latter Days. If you  can do something for me it will  be a Blessing both for me and my  family, and we will ever pray for  your welfare. Brother Woodruff  I refer you to my Bishop as regards  my standing in this Ward of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter  Day Saints, in the Oneida Stake   of Zion. Hoping to hear from

 I spent several years in and near Salt Nake City, in the in-  vestigation of Lake Bonneville, the ancient predecessor of Great  Salt Lake, so that I am well acquainted with the unique struct-  ure which Mr. Krassnoff desires to see reproduced in the historic  city, the former capital of his fatherland.    I infer from his inquiry that his purpose will be served if  he obtains any statement of dimensions ^mode of construction, form of truss,^ etc.^,^ which will enable an  architect to copy the building with a near approach to accuracy.    If you desire to communicate with Mr. Krassnoff direct, his  address is: A. Krassnoff, University of Kharkof, Russia. You  may write him in English, as he is well conversant with that  language. If however you prefer to send the information to this  offceice, it will be forwarded to him.    Yours with respect    G K. Gilbert  Chief Geologist.

 Salt Lake City January 5, 1895.    The First Presidency of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,    Dear Bretheren: Your communication  of December 29, 1894 enquiring if it would be "agreeable to my  feelings and consistant with my circumstances to go on a  mission to the Southern States" was received on the 31st ult. and  it is with the greatest pain, regret and sorrow that I am  compelled to write this communication in order to lay before  you the facts relative to my condition. Although it would [be]  perfectly agreeable and in harmony with my feelings to give an  affirmative answer to your letter of inquiry, yet, I, as well as  others, who know my condition, believe that it would be inconsistant  with my circumstances as I am at present physically incapable  of performing the labors of a missionary. For the last eighteen  months I have been suffering with a complaint, which until  right recently, I have been unable to find the cause of or cure  for it, and during all that time I have been doctored and  drugged which only aggravated the desease, until about 2 months  ago I was almost compelled to take to my bed, having be-

I feel  in myself unworthy to fill such a honerable position,   but I am willing and will be ready on the day that you  have stated.    I have been a pleasure seeking lad, traveling some forbiden  paths, and paying very little attention to religeon, but feel  like it is my duty and for the best to respond; my father   will furnish me in means, to meet my expenses and all  seems well for me to go, as I have thought earenestly and  received much council.

 come so weak and emancipated. I began, at last, to study my  condition and it is only recently Ithat I realized the terrible  state of my health. My bowels had become hardened & stiff  through the effects of so much purging medicines which I had taken  to get them to move, until they lost all power & completely refused  to act. This was about two months ago & very fortunately for me  I at last obtained a little relief. By subjecting myself to  the most rigid diet, in connection with a little medicine to  aid digestion I have been improving a little, but it is very  slow work. I have become so weak, having lost nearly 15 pounds  of flesh, that at present a walk of over a mile at a time  almost exhausts me. This in brief is the true condition of  my health at the present time and I thought it wise that  you should become acquainted with these circumstances, so  that you will be able to judge wisely & justly, whether or not  I could perform the labors required of a missionary, or even  partake of the hospitality of the people among whom I might  be sent. I do not state the above with the least desire to shirk  or avoid the duty which is required of me. Dear Brethern, such  a desire is fartherest from my heart.

 THE DESERET NEWS.    REMARKS  By Elder Wilford Woodruff, delivered   in the Tabernacle, G. S. L. City, Oct.   7th, 1867.    REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.    Yesterday morning when I came into  this tabernacle it was some little time  before I could tell whether what I saw   was in vision, or whether it was real  and literal; but I soon became thorough-  ly convinced that I was in the taberna-  cle of the Lord built here in the moun-  tains, and saw before me some ten or   twelve thousand Latter-day Saints.    I have been interested in the counsels  and instructions which we have receiv-  ed here in this house, and when we, as  elders, have texts given us to preach  from I feel that we, in a measure, are  bound to confine ourselves to those   texts. In the few remarks that I may   make I wish to speak upon them.    The first text was the emigration. We   have been gathered together by the gos-  pel of Jesus Christ. We have partaken   of its blessings, and as far as lies in our  power we should extend those blessings  to our brethren and sisters abroad. It   is our duty to do all we can to assist in  emigrating the poor from the nations of   the earth, for the Lord requires it at our   hands.    The second text was the education of   our children. The subject was address-  ed to mothers; it applies also to the  fathers. This is a subject of vast im-  portance to the Latter-day Saints. If   any one were to ask me when the edu-  cation of our children begins; I will not   tell you what you believe, but I will tell   you what I believe -- I believe that edu-  cation begins when the spirit of life en-  ters the tabernacle of the child. That  is the way I view it. If the mother has  the spirit of God upon her, when she  prays and calls upon the Lord for his   blessing, I believe that that power and   spirit affects her child, and will do so  until the day of its birth, and will affect  it from that time henceforth and forev-  er. While the mother lives her influ-  ence, example, and teachings will affect  her child through life. If she teaches  her child virtue, honesty and righteous   principles, if she teaches him to pray,  these teachings will have their effect   upon him through life. If parents know   the effect of their example on their chil-  dren, we should many times do very   different from what we do. When a   father gives counsel to is wives and   children about anything he desires done  about his place, his orchard, his garden   or farm, and the wife teaches her chil-  dren to obey their father, that has its   effect upon the children -- they work  together. But let the mother, as soon   as the father's back is turned say to her  children "your father is gone and you   may go and pick those apples or grapes,  or you may go and gather this, that and   the other, your father will not know   anything about it, and it will be all   right," she sets a very bad example be-  fore her children, she teaches them to   steal and to take an evil course; but let   the mother carry out the counsels of the   father, and they both work together in  teaching their children righteous prin-  ciples, and their children will grow up   having learned to obey their parents.  Mothers in Israel should remember that,  unless they do their best to carry out  the counsels of the head of the family,  they set a bad example before the chil-  dren and take a course that the Lord   will not approve and bless; but let them   be one with their husbands in carrying   out his counsels and the Lord will bless  them and their children. Many a time,  when in the vision of my mind, I con-  template the great duties and responsi-  bilities that will yet rest on the rising   generation among the Latter-day   Saints, I feel that we as parents are too  slow in our duties towards our children.  No better legacy can we bestow upon   them than to teach them every truth   which we ourselves are in possession of;  then they will honor us, honor the   priesthood, magnify their callings, and  carry out the great purposes of our God.    The next subject referred to by the  President was the call for a certain   number of teams to haul rock for   the temple. I need not say much in   relation to this. The people have   built this tabernacle, and we have got  to build the temple. If the inhabitants   of Zion felt the lack, weight and bless-  ings of the most high God that are with-  in their reach, there is not a man in Is-  rael who would refuse for one moment   to do anything in his power to further  the building of the temple. God designs  to bestow the blessings of heaven upon  the Latter-day Saints. There are very  few in Israel who have received the ful-  ness of the blessings of the kingdom of  God, while there are thousands, proba-  bly, who are worthy to receive them.   We must have a temple in order to bes-  tow these blessings.    The next text was some young men   were called to go south to strengthen   the southern country. This is all right,  they may just as well go there as any-  where else. When we received this  gospel we entered into covenant to obey   the Lord. We then received a mission   that will never close as long as we   dwell in the flesh whether we go east,  west, north or south. We are fulfill-  ing that mission whether we go to Eng-  land or to Dixie; it is all the same as   long as we are under the dictation of the   holy priesthood. Then let us fulfil all   missions and comply with all calls made   upon us.    The next pleasing text given was for   the young men and maidens to marry.  I want to say a few words to the young  ladies. A great many men are called   south. They are required by the Holy   Priesthood to marry. Now, when these  young men ask you young ladies to   marry them, do not ask them how rich   they are, or how much gold and silver  they have; but let the question with you   be, are they good, are they virtuous, are   they Latter-day Saints, are they obey-  ing counsel and trying to do what is  required of them. If they are doing   this, you should not require the young  men in Israel to be worth ten thousand   dollars in gold, nor a dozen carriages;   and any father or mother who throws   obstacles in the way of the young folks  being married through such considera-  tions does not do right. Let them ful-  fil the commandments. You may ask   them if they have three straw beds all  but the ticks, and if the young men  possess them, then marry them.    The next text was to lay up your  wheat. I do not want to say much  about this. The army of our God that  has gone through this territory and   which is about to visit the nations of  the earth will soon teach us this lesson.   We certainly should begin to feel the   importance of carrying out this counsel.   It has been given to us for years and  years past and gone.    The next text presented by President   Young was upon the necessity of learn-  ing and observing the laws of health.   I may say this is of vast importance.   I do not feel that I am particularly  qualified to teach you on this principle;  but I am satisfied that if we will keep  the Word of Wisdom, be temperate in   our lives and be faithful before the Lord   that we shall have more of the Spirit of   the Lord, and may considerably pro-  long our lives. It is a maxim with   President Young -- and I believe it is  true -- that a man should not teach what   he does not practice. We are intempe-  rate in many things. We are intem-  perate in labor as well as many other   things. I have been intemperate in   this myself. I have seen so much to do   in the world, so much around me that  I felt ought to be done to save things   from going to waste, that many times I  have felt that I have done wrong in   laboring so hard. I do not know, how-  ever, but that it is better to wear out  than to rust out. I would far sooner see   a man labor hard than see him a lazy  vagabond depending upon the exertions  of others for his livelihood. The Word   of Wisdom covers a great deal of ground   and I am satisfied that the day will  come when we shall change in a great   many things in our manner of life, and   shall more properly appreciate teach-  ings on this subject than we do now.    The last text given was for the Elders  to preach only what they know. This   is good counsel, and as long as we keep  within the bounds of this rule, we will  always be right. I never had more of   the spirit of God in my life than when   teaching the first principles of the  gospel, and bearing testimony to the in-  habitants of the earth that Joseph   Smith was a true Prophet of God, that  the Book of Mormon was true, and that   the first principles of the gospel, as re-  vealed through him, were the plan of   life and salvation. Whenever we, the   Elders of Israel, go beyond these limits   we are in the swamp, we do not know   where we are nor where we are going;   but as long as we keep within the limits   of our knowledge -- within what we   know and have been taught us by the  Holy Spirit, we are safe and we will be  saved with full salvation, even so:   Amen.

 Mooers, N. Y. Aug. 17, 1896.    Mr. Wilford Woodruff.  President Of The Morman Church.    Dear Sir:    I am assisting a relative in looking up the genealogy of the Presby or   Presbrey family. Years before I was born, during the Mormon excitement in  the East, two of my fathers sisters in New Hampshire married Mormons and  went West, while the Mormans were at Nauvoo ILL. Mary Ann Presby married  William M. Parker in New Hampshire. I think they had been married a num-  ber of years before they joined the Mormon church. Mary Ann Presby was  born in Lyman N. H. in 1810. She died in Chicago or Nauvoo Ill in 1845, not  long, I think, after she and her husband went West with the Mormons.  Mr. and Mrs. Parker had children before they joined the Mormon church.  There is now lying before me a letter which William M. Parker wrote to   my father, dated at Chicago Feb. 7, 1845, and he signs his name as an Elder  in the Mormon chucrch. Will you please be so kind as to have some one  look up your records and inform me about the family of William M. Parker.  Can you inform me about his children by my aunt, giving their names,  who they married, &c. Will you please give me the names and addresses of  one or two of their decendants from whom I might be most likely to get  the genealogical information which I need. Please also inform me about  the subsequent history of William M. Parker, date of his death &c.   My father also had a younger sister, Colista Presby, who joined the Mormon  church and went West soon after her sister above named did. We know nothi[ng]  of her subsequent history. Can you tell me who she may have married, and  anything about her decendants, if she has any. Any information from your  records, or which you may help me to obtain from decendants of the aunts  I have referred to will be very thankfully received. Please let me hear  from you as soon as convenient. I inclose a stamp fop [for] reply.    Very Truly Yours.    J. W. Presby.    REV. J. W. PRESBY, PH. D.

Ogden, Utah  Oct. 8, [18]95.  GIVE DATE OF THIS LETTER IN YOUR REPLY. 189    President Wilford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    After some unavoidable delay, which I regret, I hasten to   reply to your letter of September 4th. 1895, and make known to you   my feelings in regard to taking a mission to Great Britain.    I am, at any time I can arrange to leave, ready and   willing to go, but at present I cannot seem to so arrange.    My Brother, Frank J. has been requested to make known  when he can go as a missionery to California. I now learn from   him that he has arranged to go sometime this fall or winter, if   desired, and the business interests of our firm, just at this time,  being such, we both being active in the business, that it would  be almost impossible for both of us to be away at the same time,  and father does not feel able to assume the whole managment and  control of the business alone, I therefore feel that I will  have to ask for a postponement.    I have talked the matter over with Father and all  interested and we have concluded that either Frank J. or myself  can and will respond now and if there is any preference I think  that it can be complied with, the one remaining will go as soon  after the other returns as desirable.    I trust that the above will meet with your approval, and  remain,    Your Brother in the Gospel.  Sidney O. Stevens    I can heartily endorse this letter and will say that   I would recommend Frank J. to go now in place of   Sidney O. they are both good men and in full fellowship  if both are called to go now the business would suffer  very much.    Respectfully your bro. in the Gospel  Robert McQuarrie Bishop  2nd Ward Ogden    over--
