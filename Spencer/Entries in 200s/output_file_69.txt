Wilford Woodruff Dearest Father:  For some time I have felt that I wanted  to write you a letter, bearing on some  matters of importance which you have mentioned  in a number of your letters to me. To com- mence with you say you are glad that I  am not at home for one reason and that  is because of Politics. I think as you do Pa  that it is a shame for our people to let these matters of this kind stir them up  to such an extent. A great many people Pa who are good Latter day Saints cannot understand how it is that the Apostles take part in  Politics. Not that these matters worry me in the least for I am not a member of  either of them, I thank the Lord to say and think that I shall take the stand of a nonpartisian No one can deny but that both parties are  wrong. They both have something good and more  bad. Not that I wish to critisize any of our  apostles but politics and religion don't go well together.

This may be  possible but I don't think so. It strikes me very  strongly that there must be enough for our  apostles to do to keep matters in the church  in running order without dabbling in the  "political Dish." You may have an object in  allowing these apostles to enter into Politic's and suppose with out a doubt you have or else you would not allow it. Prehaps I had no business to remark mention such a thing but it is my belief that  the people would honor you all the more if  you would forbid your apostles from taking  any hand in these matters. You will forgive me I hope for saying any such thing and  my only reason for making such remarks is  that the matter is not entirely clear to me. There are so many things I want to ask you  about in a religious way.

Dear Brother: I am busy as ever and have not therefore time to  write a lengthy letter in reply to your favor of the 28th of July. I was very  pleased to hear from you, and that all was well with you. My health at present  is quite good. You are very fortunate in having plenty of water in that part of  the country. We are still suffering for the want of this necessary element. We have had one or two slight showers of rain lately, but not enough to lay  the dust. The weather still continues very hot, and everything almost is burning  up. It is said that this is the hottest season ever known in Salt Lake. I  see that you also have had a share of it.  Our election passed off quietly. The result shows to us that the  People's Party in this City will have to be very wide awake and cast every vote  they have in order to save the city at the next election. Our people have been  rather careless and indifferent in the past in political matters. Now they  have got to arouse themselves and do all to their power to prevent our opponents  from gaining the ascendency.  Brother Geo. Q. Cannon and myself have just returned from a trip  to Bear Lake Stake. We held conference there with the people, and had a very enjoyable  time.

Our brethren have built quite a little village there, composed of tents and small cabins, and planted very nice flower gardens and walks, and brought the water through the village.  We had a very interesting day.  There were about thhree hundred persons present.  We had speeches and various enter- tainments, and a feast.  We visited the stone quarry, which I was deeply inter- ested in.  Rocks twice the size of your house are being split up into blocsks of the finest granite in the world.  I was very much surprised to see their manner of operation.  They drill holes in the side of a rock fifty feet high and drive in little wedges which split it straight open, and they then cut it up into blocks.

Br Lowba came here last  fall and organized a branch of the Church, since then we have held meetings every  Sunday, and have had a good degree of  the Holy Spirit, in its light, and Intelligence. The old saints who are here mostly belong to  the young Josephites, and do not come to  our meetings. If any of the Elders should  be coming this way Br Garlick would  like them to call on him, he lives on Second street between N and O streets, we have had  one letter from Br Lowba from New York, he could not find any saints there. It seems  to me that the Old saints have got into a  state of darkness in regard to the old Church, and their minds are no longer enlightened by the spirit of Truth, and having lost that,  they are liable to be deceived by anything  that comes along, here we find some of them Second Adventists, some  Josephits, but in themselves seem to have no  true foundation, so that when Christ comes  they will be found among the foolish virgins  with their lamps gone out, and no oil or  light of the Holy Spirit to replenish them. ##Matthew 25:1-13## ENDENTRY Provo City Oct 18th 1869  Hon.

Reverend Sir  As a stranger I must apologise for taking the liberty of  addressing you but I am deputed by the to write this letter on behalf of the Goalen a member and Elder of the Church of Latter  Day Saints, as it has been found impossible by his silence from gleaning any  intelligence from him.  Brother Goalen left London last May (1891) leaving behind his  wife and 5 little children (all under 12) including an infant of 5 months old. Prior to his departure (which he had arranged and carried out very quickly) he faithfully  promised that he would send home regular weekly remittances so to maintain his wife  and family. This pledge he also gave me and he promised me on the word of a Christian that he would redeem this pledge.  For some time he sent home monies, which I can vouch  myself were faithfully expended in purchasing food andc for the family.  About the fall of last year these remittances gradually fell away likewise letters.  The wife finding herself  in this position had to seak what scant labor she could, her own trade as an army  accoutrement maker having fallen off.  The worry of this and seeing her home gradually having to be sold to meet her rent soon told upon her, and, as I feared,  has now so undermined her health, as to utterly prostrate her and incapacitate her  from again following (for a long time at least) any employment, consequently  the family are now starving.  The last remnant of furniture that would realise any  cash was very reluctantly sold to a dealer, viz a piano which fetched only 8 pounds. With care this sum was laid out to pay rent, furing and food for 17 weeks through  the late bitter winter.  Mrs Goalen finding she can get no response to her letters and the  situation being a painful one has compelled her to ask me to appeal to you on her behalf believing that you will as a Christian gentleman try and bring the errant husband  to the knowledge of the grave position of those he has so cruelly deserted in this great City.  I now  on their behalf ask you Sir to immediately use your best endeavors to compell Brother Goalen  to communicate with his family and to do that which he has an undoubted  right to  do I as their advocate shall indeed be pleased to know that your kind efforts have borne  good fruit and that I as the humble writer of this epistle have only done my duty. I might add that any plea made by Brother Goalen leaving them a good home is no set off  to his silence.  The wages of "Smith's" in your City are well known here and he told his wife that he could easily earn Â£ 5 a week. half of which sum he would send her.

He died on the 1st inst after about two weeks illness of chills and fever, then bilious fever, terminating in lung Fever. ^he was buried on the 4th. with military honors.^ He is much lamented in Israel, but now lamented for his own sake, for we know it is well with Jedediah  The last hand cart Coy. arrived nNov 30 which relieved our feelings greatly.

The last Coy. are at Bridger; and about 60 4 horse teams have gone out to bring them in, with about 30 or 40 tons of flour.  Bro. Franklin and myself are all of the Quorum who are now in the valley, and the Presidency having put the Missionaries under our control, we feel that the responsibility upon us at this time requires us to live near the Lord that his grace may be sufficient for us.

After travling 100 miles on the steam boat; we took a vessel and was landed on North fox Island at 2 oclok  Sunday morning following, entire strangers and about peneyless. We called at the first house and retired to rest, as we had slept none through the day and night. We arose at 8 oclock took breakfast. I then enquire if their was any priest or religion on the Island. they informed us theirre was a Baptist meeting house and church and priest in the centre of the Island, and that there would be preaching to day. In the name of the Lord we hastened to the place. Meeting had commenced. I sent for the deacon to come to the door; I told him we were servents of God, we had a message to the people and wished to be herd. he informed the priest of it. he invited us into the pulpet. After he closed they had a short intermission I then arose and addressed the congregation, and it was amid many peculiar feelings; knowing that it was the first time the voice of an Elder ^of^ the Latter Day Saints, was herd upon one of the Islands of the sea, to set forth the fullness of the gospel. When I closed I gave out several appointments for preaching in different parts of the Island, which was 9 miles long and 2 miles wide containing 800 inhabitants divided into four distrects having four school houses. We presented Mr Newton (this Baptist priest) the Book of Mormon he was mild, did not object to it, said he would read it. In the first fourteen days, we preached nineteen discourses, and the whole Island flocked out to hear. The priest began to see his foundation giving way, he was alarmed and began to cry against us and would not let us have the meeting house. But the excitement ^was^ so great and the people so much in our favor that on Sunday the 27th the people asseb assembled at a school house to hear us ENDENTRY Paris, Henry County Tennessee Dec 9th 1835 Eunice Beloved and Respected Friends A  Multiplicity of busineess has hitherto prevented me from  informing you that I had receieved A letter from you which I perused with great pleasure and was much gratified to hear once more from my friends I also received A letter from Brother Asahel under date of Sept 9th which stated that he was well and some prospect of his calling to see me I have enjoyed the best of health since I last wrote allthough I have laboured almost night and day for the salvation of the honest and meek of this south country Elder Warren Parrish left me as he was called to Kirtland on the 23rd of July since that time I have ben labouring alone untill A few Days since I was joined by one of the travling Elders my circuit has been and still is very ex^s^tensive it is about 130 miles in length and I make it A point to travel through in two weeks the Elders of the Church of Latter Day Saints generally make it a point to two by two and on part and I generally have done So myself. still I came to this state but as my circuit is so extensive I cannot do it well here and as my friends Desire to supply me with horses I consider it no sin to ride them for I have many waters to cross which at times I cannot ford them with my horse without swiming him which I occasionally do and at one time while attempting to swim Bloody River The courant being rapid my horse got tangled among the brush I was obliedged to leeve her and swim out myself however we both got out unharmed I have travled all weather wet or dry, cold or hot, I have many calls upon the right and left hand far more than I can attend to we have Baptized on my circuit 112 and 24 of them I have Baptized since Brother Parrish left me and I espect to Baptize a number more soon as their is 10 or 15 have manifested their determinations to follow they friends by entering into the New and Everlasting Covenant I have been much opposed by the priests of the day in this county more however behind my back than ato my face some few have opposed me publickly face to face such I have always publicly answered and the Lord in not one instance has suffered me to be confounded ENDENTRY I have had a great desire to visit my parents and the rest of my relatives in the Eastern States and I thought I should have seen ^them^ ere this but there has been more and more resting upon me from the time I first commenced labouring here of the the Church is in its infancy and their has been but vary few labourers in this south country.

Even the deacons of the church were attending our meetings and enquiring into these things and and calling upon us to visit them, and the sound went abroad to other Islands of the sea with rapidity, and they came over in their ships and boats to hear for themselves. On Sunday the 3rd Sept. I preached to a Large congregation assembled together from different Islands after I closed a very wealthy, respectable Lady came foreward and wished to be baptised. We repaired to the waters of the Hale lead them down into the sea and baptized them. These are the first baptized upon the Islands of the sea (to my knowledge) by the Elders of Israel, and they are the first fruits of our min- istry here. and On last Sunday the 10 th of the month, I met a large congregation at the same place from different Islesands, and and preached to them from Math 16 ch 17, 18, and when I closed another sea captain a member of the Baptist church came forward for baptism and also a  young Lady. We repaired to the sea shore, and while the people throng'd the beach I lead them forth into the ocean and baptized them both for the lade hands upon them and they received the Holy ghost and were made glad. On the Tuesday following three others wished to be baptized and the ordinance was administered unto them by Elder Hale which makes seven we have baptized. Thus you seae the Lord hath not sent us here in vain. There is many on our right and left ready as it were to step into the waters of Baptism. Calls begin to salute us from the different Islands come and preach to us, come and preach to us. We have visited South Fox Island and held five meet- ings with them, they came out by hundreds and filled the homes. South Fox Island is 10 miles  long and 5 wide containing 1000 inhabitants with 6 school houses no meeting house but a methodist church, and a priest in their midst. They have 3 saw mills and one grist mill these are all tide mills vinal haven fits out rising of 100 vessels for fishing and mostly from this Island.  The inhabitants of Vinalhaven are wealthy, healthy, industrious, intelligent, generous and very hospitable to strangers notwithstanding they are mostly fishermen. pop 1,800. Vinalhaven includes both of North Island is rather rocky and rough have some fine farms, rase good wheat, barley, and potatoes, which is the staple pro- ductions, but little stock excepting sheep which are numerous. they have but just finished haying and are now in the midst of wheat harvest. There is an aboundance of raspburies and gooseburies on these Islands, but are now mostly gone. not much of any other fruit. The timber is spruice, fir, and hemlock. Their is one Post Office and store on this Island. one tide grist mill, andc.  South Fox Island is as near without any form or void I think as any think I ever saw. It is almost impossible for the best historian to give an exact description of it. it is a universal mass of ledges and shelves of rocks formed into hills and valleys cut up into necks and points to make room for the coves and harbours that run through and through this Island. One may form some faint idea of it, on learning that it is supposed to be rising of 100 miles round the Island to follow the beach in all its crooks and angles. There is some small parts of this Island under cultivation but it is at the expens of great labour and toil. The hills are timbered with pitch pine and  spruce, the timber and bushes principly grow out of the cracks of the rocks, while the valleys are timbered in the same manner with fir and birch. this people procured their wealth and living wholey by fishing, perhaps their is no people that supply greater quantities of fish than they of this Island. many of them fish at Newfoundland and prepare them for sale here. their is many kinds of fish here around these Island such as Whale, Blackfish, shark, ground shark, Pilot fish, Hors mackerel, stergeon, Holloboat, Salmon, Cod, Pollock, Hake, Haddock, Shad, Mackerel Tom cod, Bass, Alewives Herren, Pohagen, Dolphin Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Scate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Muttonfish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers, Munkfish, Nurs fish, Sunfish, Sword fish, Tharsher, catfish, whiting, scuppog, Tootog, Eyefish, Minney's, cunner, Ling, Eels,  Lobsters, clames, scollops, Mussels, Wrinkles, seal, and Porposes andc andc. and many others not named. I have stood on the shore and seen large schools of Mackerel come up to us so that we could catch any quantity of them with hooks that we wished, also the beach is supplyed with clames in almost any part of the Island. The adjoining Islands are more fertile than these.

He commenced warm hostilities against the Book of Mormon and our principles I wrote down his discours and are to give answer to it next Sunday, at which time I expect to meet a numerous assembly I learned he would not be present to hear my answer so I arose and rectifyed some of his wild mistakes in his presensce before he left the congregation. The Baptist priest has written Letters and even gone himself to the main land after several priests to come over and help them, declairing if they do not come the churches here will surely fall. -But cursed is man that puteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm saith the Lord- But O ye priests of Baal your cry is in vaine. The God of Israel hath set his hand to recover Israel his people The stone has begun to roll. God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the wise, and with them he will rend your Kingdoms. The cry of the Saints is assending unto the Ears of the Lord of Sabaoth for Ephraim. The Apostles of the Lamb of God are bearing the Keys of his Kingdom on the shores of gospel of JESUS CHRIST and injoying its power. And the call of many from distant Islands has already entered into our Ears to come and preach to them. My own Book of Mormon has this day taken its departure over the billows of the great deep to teach those that trade in ships at sea, and the word and work is propelled by the arm of JEHOVAH. And every weapon formed against Zion shall soon be broken, and he that raises his puny arm against it is fighting against God, and shall soon mourn because of his loss. I say these things are so as God himself and the Spirit beareth record and the record is here. Therefore O Babylon thy fall is sure.  My dear parents suffer me to drop a few words of my meditations on this paper. When I think where I am, what my calling is, and where I have been  and whareere I shall be, and have to do in this generation, I marvel and wonder. I page torn myself. A few years since, I was tending mill as other men not expecting to do page torn to live and die with my friends. But how changed the scene, the last four years has page torn the plow, called me into the ministry, bestowed the Holy priesthood, annointing, page torn Blessing upon my head, and called me into the ranks of the seventy Apostles to page torn from the ends of the earth, and act a conspicuous part in winding up the august scene of these last days in rending the Kingdom of darkness, and illegible word with everlasting truth. It has called me to visit 16 different states in America, and travel about 14,000 miles to preach the word of God, and are now standing upon the Islands of the Sea, and thousands seeking wisdom and instruction at my mouth, While at the same time its wise and learned complain Bitterly that I am sapping the foundations of their Holy religion, churches and kingdom, and the ships of the sea spread their canvas to bring captains and sailors to hear my voice. I say amid these truths I ask myself the question who am I. ^I^ am that poor, weak, ignorant, Illiterate Willford. then I have nothing to boast. No God forbid. It is not Willford that has done this, but it is the power and work of God. I'll acknowledge he hath chosen the weak things of this world to perform his work with, and if I glory it shall be in the cross of Christ  I cannot tell when I shall see any of you again, their was some invisidble power seemed to hurry me from Kirtland, untill I reached these Islands, and the reason was because of the great work to be done here, for the sound will go from here to a vast number of the Islands to prepare the way before us. But I rejoice that I had the privilege of visiting you at all. I now feel as though it will be my privilege to visit you again and build up a church in connecticut. But if I do not I pray GOD to send some one among you that will. I have great faith yet to believe that many of my blood relations and other friends will stand in the covenant before they die. yes I believe my  Parents and their family will, for I know they are of the Blood of Ephraim, and the Lord will never suffer the good my father hath  done to the poor in his ^day^ go unrewarded. I believe you will both live to see a change in this world which is fast hastning. it would be great joy to my soul to see you stand in the covenant. It is the work of God that hath called me to do as I have done, and it marvelous in mine eyes. I rather expect to spend next summer amid these Islands of the sea. I intend to visit Deer Island as soon as possible, it is but 12 miles to it. it contains 4000 inhabitants, and there is but one priest among them. I do not know whare I shall spend the winter, whether here or in Scarborough. My friends may still direct letters to Scarborough.
