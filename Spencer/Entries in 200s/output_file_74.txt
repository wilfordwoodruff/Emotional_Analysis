HENRY LEWIS WOODRUFF,  Dear Sir:  I have received your letter of Dec. 2nd. with geneological history enclosed; and I feel under great obligation to you for them, as I, like yourself, am deeply interested in the Woodruff genealogy. And I sign to say, it does not require an apology on your part for making the corrections you offer concerning what I wrote you, as I very much desire to have everything pertaining to this matter as correct as it is possible to get it; and I am satisfied that you are as near correct as a person can be by searching the records and works at your command. In regard to what  I said concerning the lineage of the two English Woodruffs and the spell- ing of their names, I acted upon what was before me; but you, doubtless, have better sources of information that I.  With regard to Hartford and Farmington, what I wrote you regarding them I took from the History of J. Hammond Trumbull; and I should, of course, have men- tioned the source of my information.  As to the spelling of the Woodruff name in so many different ways,  I do not wonder so much at that, for the reason, as you yourself have doubtless learned, that it is quite a common thing for a name in the course of generations to undergo a variety of changes in spelling without in the least affecting the lineage. As to whether Matthew and John Woodruff were brothers or not I really do not know myself; I have come to regard them as such here by way of taking it for granted than from actual gene- alogical or historical knowledge.

Derar Brother  Your letter of the 28th has just arrived and in reply will say: As I understand the matter of land there, I homesteaded a quater section of land, but could not fulfill the law, and it was turned over to you, and you let me have 30 acres of it. I sold that 30 acres to my son Wilford, and I considered that that ended my con- nection with the land. I did something about the fencing, but I do not know how much it was nor what it was. Of course, we ahve never occupied any of it, but my son, I think, rented someof it to your cousin. I have talked with Wilford this morning concerning this letter, and he says you have some feelings about a mule that you let Flavel Spencer have and you hold Wilford responsible for it in some way; but this is a matter that I have no knowledge of nor any respon- siblility in. I have too much on my hands to be troubled with anything about this land. You will have to settle it with Wilford, and he ought to do what is right about it. iI suppose he will write to you.

Cannon, Dear Brother:  I write to say that I am calling  some young men to be missionaries to Germany, including three bankers, Schettler's  Schaerrer time is out and he epxects to come home and we want someone to preside, and Brother Hugh. Now our boys feel that they would like very much to labor under him if he could go and pre- side there, and before writing to you I sent for him to come and see me. I have just had an interview with Hugh; he feels as though he would not  like to go Germany to preside, but if he went he would rather go as a  missionary and some one else to preside, but that is the very kind of a  man that ought to preside and not one who is seeking the office. Now concerning Hugh, I do not know that he ought to be called to go upon any  mission at present. He has lately returned from a mission there and gone into business, though I think he is not much involved in debt. I felt to  lay the matter before you and get your counsel upon it, and can you name any one who would be suitable to preside there. ^if Hugh did not go^ The 20th of January is the time named to start. I would be glad of an early reply to this.  Now concerning our affiairs east, of course we are interested in  all your labors and accomplishments.

On the occasion of the retirement of Elder Karl G. Maeser, D.L.D., from his active labors as an instructor and a prin- cipal of our church schools, to devote his full time and attention to the duties of his exalted position as General Superin- tendent of the Church school system, we, the undersigned, having enjoyed for  many years the privilege of students, and later, the honors of associate teachers under his immediate tuition and direc- tion do seek to express, though of neces- sity in a feeble and an inadequate man- ner, the esteem and the honor with which Dr. Maeser and his labors are regarded by us.  This we do with the approval and co-operation of the General Board of Education of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Dr. Maeser is in truth the Pioneer  Teacher in the Church schools of our  people, and since beginning his labors here he has held a foremost place among  the educators of Utah. During the six- teen years of his most efficient and di- vinely inspired principalship, the Brig- ham Young academy of Provo has ad- vanced from the position of a lower grade school to that of an academy in fact, with worthy graduates counted by hundreds and present and former students num- bering thousands.  We feel that we, in common with the  youth of our people, owe to Brother Maeser an incalcuable debt of gratitude for his precepts and example, and his whole souled devotion in the cause of education amongst us.  Our relations with him as our senior teacher, principal, brother and friend have been of the most pleasant nature and our affection for him is that of sons, for a loving parent.  While we feel that his removal from  the field of active teaching is a loss, we find consolement in the know- ledge that the scope of his in- valuable labors is greatly expanded, and  we rejoice that our relations with him  will not be entirely severed, for in his capacity as General Superintendent of Church Schools we shall still regard him  as a counselor and a director of our labors.  Our earnest prayers will be that health, peace and success may attend him in his work of love for the youth of Zion, and  that the All-wise Father may long spare  his life to us and our people.  In behalf of the General Board of Edu- cation.  WILFORD WOODRUFF, Psesident, GEORGE REYNOLDS, Secretary, J. E. TALMAGE, D.S.D., WILLARD DONE, D.B., JOSEPH NELSON, J. J. WALTON, RICHARD HAAG. ENDENTRY "Presidents Office, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec. 2, 1889.  To the Presidents of Stakes and their Counselors.  Dear Brethren:  There never was a time probably in our history, when the Latter- day Saints needed more than they do at present the assistance which God has promised to render to us. He has made precious promises to His Church; among them He has said that no weapon that is formed against Zion shall prosper. This will be fulfilled to the very letter. The Lord's word cannot fail. But it is for us, as a people, to place ourselves in such a condition that we can ask the Lord in faith for these bless- ings, and receive them at His hand. We should so live that He will feel bound by His promises to come to our aid and to fulfil His words to us. We have never appealed to Him in vain. He has always  listened to our supplications when we have approached Him aright. The knowledge of this encourages us to cry unto Him as an entire people, with united voice. And that we may do this in a proper manner we have felt led to set apart the next anniversary of the ENDENTRY  A Tribune reporter yesterday after- noon called on President Wilford  Woodruff for the purpose of interview- ing him relative to the disturbance  caused by Democratic leaders over the recent priesthood meeting. The ven- erable head of the Mormon church had, however, already prepared a statement for publication, which is as follows:  To All Whom it May Concern: Inasmuch as there has been so much  written and said concerning the pro- ceedings of a priesthood meeting held  in the Assembly hall on Monday, the  7th day of October, I feel it my duty to make a statement concerning it.  I consider it the right of every man,  woman and child on earth to enjoy  their religion, let that religion be what it may, for that is between themselves and their Creator. So I say with re- gard to politics. Every man has a  right to enjoy his political beilef un- molested, let this be what it may.  There is not a Democrat in Utah Ter- ritory who can truthfully say that I  ever asked him to vote a Republican  ticket, or join the Republican party. Neither can any Republican say that I ever asked him to vote a Democratic ticket, or join the Democrats.  A part of my own family are Repub- licans and part are Democrats. I have never counseled one of them to change his politics. They are, all of them,  strong, independent men, and they en- joy their freedom without any inter- ference of their father.  Now, concerning that meeting re- ferred to, there was not, according to my recollection, one word said about  Democrats, Republicans or politics.  Joseph F. Smith's remarks were upon the same subject that the Apostles had taught through the conference to ten thousand people.  When the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was organized, it  was with the holy priesthood in its various orders and quorums. And  when a man was appointed to the Apostleship or Presidency, or in any office, as a teacher of the people, it  placed him in a very grave responsi- bility. And no man was counted at liberty, from the organization of the  church, to engage in any branch of business, politics, or anything else to  take him entirely away from his call- ing, business, duty or responsibility for a length of time, without first coun- seling with the Presidency of the  church, or with his quorum, on its pro- priety, and getting permission to do so.  And this order has rested upon us all  alike. And this has been my position for sixty years of my life, and that,  too, without interfering with my man- hood. And this course does not re- quire a man to give up his position in the Democratic party or in the Re- publican.  Several Democrats have called upon me since this campaign commenced.  Among the number was my friend, John T. Caine, saying he had been nominated for Governor. I said, "Go  ahead. I think you will make a good Governor." I think so still.  Every man has his own free agency.   He has the right to withdraw from  his quorum, or the church, if he  wishes. But while he remains in his  quorum, or in the church, we think he should be subject to the same rules that we are ourselves. But that duty does not require any man to withdraw from the Democratic or Republican party, or give up his polical princi- ples.  WILFORD WOODRUFF. ENDENTRY  On the afternoon of Saturday, October 8th, an Epistle from President Wilford Woodruff, in behalf of the Twelve Apos- tles, was read by Bishop Orson F. Whitney, the following be- ing a brief synopsis of it:  As some of the Apostles are prevented, by circumstances well known to the Saints, from appearing in public, the Church will naturally look for some expression from them concerning their feelings and  hopes respecting the work of our God. Especially at the pre- sent time is deep interest felt in the utterances of the Apostles, because of the loss which the Church has sustained in the  Death of President John Taylor.  Twice before has the Church mourned the death of its Presi- dent, and each time the event has produced a profound impression upon its members. In this instance this sad event is invested with more significance than it would have been had it occurred in the ordinary way  President Taylor died in exile.  For about two years and a half he had been compelled to live in seclusion, and to refrain from all public as- sociation with the people whom he loved more than his life.  Through his decease the Church is called the third time to mourn the departure of the man who has stood as its Presi- dent and as the Prophet, Seer and Revealator to this genera- tion. The experience which the Saints have gained in pass- ing through these trials has been of exceeding value to them. They have learned that God can take care of His own work, and that they need not worry nor yield to anxiety or doubt concerning  its management.  For some time before his death the Prophet Joseph was in- spired of the Lord to anticipate his own departure from earth- ly scenes. This was shown in various ways; but especially in the great anxiety which he displayed to bestow upon the Twelve Apostles all the keys and authority of the Holy Priest- ENDENTRY A M Tenney Mch 5 1887  Answerd March 16 1889  the Barths are both in st john's Jail 4 indictments against each of them  Sol Barth for destroying the county Records and Nathan Barth for Embezling his Brothers Property the one that is dead  St Johns Apache Co, Arizona Ter March 5th 1886 1887  Dear Bro Allen  I recieved your kind letter which conveyed the news of a Mission to the llakis Yaquis in Sonora Mexico  I amediately answered it and Now again will answer more fully  I desire to Place before you my views coupled with my situation since my imprisonement and I do so freely and ask you to treat it Confidentially  first I will say that the time I wrote you in relation to a Mission to the Llakis ^yaquis^ I did not expect to be Honored with a Call so very quick allthough you did not state the time for me to go but I thought that it would take at least untill next fall  Next) My financial circumstances are in a very pitiafull condition.

It is for this end that we address this circular to you, that all the Latter- day Saints throughout these mountains may be informed that the day mentioned is designated and set apart as a day of general fasting and prayer for the whole Church, and that the Saints may assemble at their various meeting houses and devote the day to prayer to Almighty  God in behalf of Zion.  We need not describe at any length the reasons there are for making  in this united appeal to our Great Creator. They are familiar to you and to all the people. It is easy to perceive that we are menaced with a total deprivation of our rights as free men and as citizens, because we are members of the Church of the Lamb of God. Look which way we will and there appears no earthly help of which  we can avail ourselves. But we can turn to the Lord in per- fect confidence that he will hear and help us.  ^*Circulars  beginning  at were furn ished the Bish ops, Presidents  of Prayer Circles,  and a few other  brethren^  *We think the fast should be from sundown on Sunday, the  22nd, to sundown on Monday, the 23rd, covering a period of twenty-four hours.  ^Was not in  the Bishop's  Etc Circulars^  We desire you to take immediate steps to notify the Bishops and their Counselors, and other presiding officers in your Stakes, of the appointment of this Fast Day, that it may be known to all  the Saints of your Stakes.  ^In Cirular^  All labor that can be dispensed with should be suspended on that  day, and the people should assemble themselves—men, women and children—and humble themselves before the Lord, and call upon Him in mighty prayer to look with mercy and tender compassion upon the people of His Church.  Among other subjects for which we should pray on the Fast Day, now set apart, the following should not be forgotten:  We should pray for the plots and the schemes which are being framed for the purpose of robbing us of our civil and political rights and of obtaining control of our cities, counties and Territory, to be confounded, and their authors to be thwarted in their evil designs.  We should pray for all who conspire, in any manner, to injure or destroy the work of God, or take from the people their rights and lib- erties, to be defeated in their wicked purposes.  We should pray for the unfavorable action of courts and officials to be overruled in such a manner that no injury will be done to Zion.  We should pray for the Executive of our nation, for the Cabinet, the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Judiciary and the people of our nation to be so influence and controlled that their hearts will be softened towards the people of God, and that they may not ENDENTRY Parowan Iron Co Mar 31 1898 Prest Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake  Dear Bro  I here by endo- rse Bro Jensen as a missionary to the Southern States  Your Bro in the Gospel Chas Adams Bp Parowan Ward ENDENTRY President Woodruff's personal testimony.  I, Wilford Woodruff, being the last man living in the flesh who was present upon that occasion feel it a duty I  owe to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to the House of Isreal, and to the whole world to bear this my last testimony to all nations, that in the winter of 1843-4, Joseph Smith, the Prophet of God, called the Twelve Apostles together in the City of Nauvoo, and spent many days with us in giving us our endowments, and teaching us those glorious principles which God had revealed to him. And upon one occasion he stood upon his feet in our midst for nearly three hours declaring unto us the great and last dispensation which God had set His hand to perform up- on the earth in these last days. The room was filled as if with consuming fire; the Prophet was clothed upon with much of the power of God, and his face shone and was transpar- ently clear, and he closed that speech, never-to-be-forgotten in time or eternity, with the following language:  "Brethern, I have had great sorrow of heart for fear that I might be taken from the earth with the keys of the Kindom of God upon me, with- out sealing them upon the heads of other men. God has sealed upon my head all the keys of the Kingdom of God necessary for organizing and building up of the Church, Zion, and Kingdom of God upon the earth, and to prepare the Saints for the coming of the Son of Man. Now bre- thern, I thank God I have lived to see the day that I have been enabled  to give you your endowments, and I have now sealed upon your heads all the powers of the Aaronic and Melchisedek Priesthoods and Apos- tleship, with all the keys and powers thereof, which God has sealed upon me; and I now roll off all the labor, burden and care of this Church and Kingdom of God upon your shoulders, and I now command you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to round up your shoulders, and bear off this Church and Kingdom of God before heaven and earth, and before God, angels and men; and if you don't do it you will be damned"  And the same spirit that filled the room at that time burns in my bosom while I record this testimony, and the Prophet of God appointed no one else but the Twelve Apostles to stand at the head of the Church and direct its affairs.

Salt Lake City, Utah, April 28, 1898.  To the Editor:  I am in receipt of the accompanying let- ter from the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which I should be pleased to have you publish.  Very Respectfully, HEBER M. WELLS, Govenor.  Office of the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints,  Salt Lake City, Utah, April 28, 1898.  Hon. Heber M. Wells, Governor of the State of Utah:  Dear Governor—We have read with much interest your proclamation to the people of our State, in which you call, in response to the proclamation of the President of the United States, for the enlistment of 500 men to furnish Utah's quota of the 125,000 volunteers called for by the President to serve in the army of the United States for two years.  The people whom we represent are lovers of peace, and would do anything in their power, consistent with honor and the patriotic duty which every citi- zen owes to his country, to avert war, and its dreadful train of consequences. Because of this feeling we have been led to admire to course which has been taken by President McKinley throughout this Spanish imbroglio, and we have hoped that his effort to pre- serve peace between the two countries would result in success.  But war has been declared, and we have it to meet. Our citizens are called upon to enlist, and Utah is asked to furnish cavalry and batteries of artil- lery approximating 500 men.  We trust that the citizens of Utah who are Latter-day Saints will be found ready to respond with alacrity to this call which is made upon our State. There was a time in the past when we were called upon, as a re- ligious organization, to make a far greater sacrifice than this, under cir- cumstances that were exceedingly  painful. Then there was no hesita- tion; but upwards of one-third of the men of suitable age formed a battal- ion of 500, left the camp and vol- unteered to take part in the Mexican war. In like manner there should be no hesitation now; and we sincerely trust that your recruiting officers will find our co-religionists as ready now to enlist and march to the defense of their country as their fathers were in  the days to which we refer.  Trusting that you will be eminently successful in raising Utah's proper quota of volunteers, and praying that the Almighty will protect our nation in the hour of trial and assist us in our battles for humanity and right, we remain.

ENDENTRY be inclined to listen to the slanderous reports and falsehoods which are circu lated concerning us, and which may be brought before them; and that all the officers of our nation may be inspired with such wisdom, justice and mer- cy that they will fill their stations so as to gain the love and esteem of the people and the approbation of the Lord.  In the event of the decision of the Supreme Court not being rendered before  the Fast Day concerning our property which has been seized, we should pray to the Lord to so move upon the hearts of the Judges that they will be strengthened and filled with courage, so as to render a righteous decision.  We should pray for the Lord to soften the hearts of the people of our nation, and to open their eyes that they may see us in our true light and be in- clined to treat us with that kindness and consideration which are due to fellow citizens who are loyal and true in upholding the Constitution of our great country.  We should pray for the Lord to come to our help and to deliver us from the many snares that are spread around us for our overthrow and des- truction; to make our path plain before us; to lead us so that we may es- cape from the pits that are dug for our feet.  We should pray that the Lord will pour out in great power His Holy Spirit and the gifts thereof upon His servants, that every man may be filled with the qualifications and power which are necessary to enable him to magnify his office acceptably before the Lord; and that He will fill the hearts of His Saints with comfort and peace, and witness unto them that He has not forgotten and does not neglect Zion.  Of course, there are many other blessings that can be prayed for. But we feel to mention these as being subjects that are prominent in our minds, and to which our attention is called at the present time, and  for which we ourselves exercise faith before the Lord.  In closing, we suggest to yourselves and the Saints that however much we may feel aggrieved at the acts of men towards us, we should not pray for their condemnation. Let us confess our own sins and pray that we may be forgiven for them, and leave other sinners to the Lord, who has said that judgment is His, and He will repay.  -End of Circular furnished the Bishops Etc Etc-  Praying to the Lord that He will fill you and the Saints un- der your presidency with His Holy Spirit and give unto you the  spirit of faith and prayer.

An apostate, of the name of Parrott stirs the Elders up occasionally by raising a mob when- ever he can to annoy them and to disturb our meetings. He gave Bristol to attend a Conference; but he did not succeed in interrupt- ing our proceedings or in preventing us from enjoying ourselves. Since then, he has paid Elder South- ampton a visit and issued handbills of an exciting and in- flammatory character, and has delivered public lectures against us for the avowed purpose of interfering with an putting a stop to all our labors in this country. One of his handbills is headed "One Hundred Guineas Reward" to Bro. Bramall and some others of the Elders and myself, if we will meet him and prove our doctrines true upon a certain night, named in the placard. That night he had a large audience in expecta- tion of a discussion; but there being nobody there to meet him, and the people being disappointed in seeing the fun which they expected, they left as many as twenty at a time and at the conclusion of his lecture there were scarcely any present. He disgusts every decent person who goes to hear him, and though he succeeded in obtaining a "Reverend" for his chairman in his first lectures he became so ashamed of his connexion with Parrott, that he left him. I counselled Bro. Bramall to refrain from noticing him in the least. He and the Saints have adopted this policy and thus far it has been attended with the happiest results.

There has been something wrong with almost every piece of machinery sent for, last spring they sent to Z C. M. I. for a two horse large sized Molasses cane  mill. It was put into the hands of H Clawson who sent a small one horse mill with some parts missing when it arrived. It was entirely too small for their use and last of all though not least they wanted to start a tannery had their vats in place and tanner and materials all on hand, they wanted a bark mill and sent money by Bro Flake and when he arrived  at Salt Lake requested the Beaver Co-op, who is dealing with the Z C.

Bro Smith had to send an extra team to the ferry to bring it but when it arrived behold! and Lo! it turned out to be a little giant, a corn-cob mill and not suitable for grinding bark at all, now all has to wait until a bal^r^k mill can be bought at St Louis, brought to the terminns by vail and  then freighted from there by way of Albuquer- que. Now is not this enough to try the patience of Saints? to say nothing about sinners, I think it is. I think that persons living as far from Salt Lake as these settlements are who wish to patronize their own Institutions and pay  down should have a little care and pains taken for them and not make such blunders as have been made towards them.

He thought I was not as fair with him as we wished others to be with us—that we asked others for the privilege of preaching in their halls, but would not grant him ours for such a purpose. I told him, that I would feel very differently were he an honest sectarian, who wished to set forth his views in sincerity; but he, himself, had once known the truth and had apostatized from it, and those who sent him where in the same condition, and I knew they were neither honest nor sincere. I knew their history well, and knew them to be base, bad men. He said I was afraid of the truth, and feared investigation. I replied that I knew the truth, and that there was no need at this late hour to investigate the claims of such fellows as he, for we had learned it through long years of sad experience. He then wanted to know, (though he prefaced his request by the remark that he thought I would not grant it) if I would publish the "General Epistle of President Joseph Smith."

I repeated my refusal, and as he was disposed to be pertinacious, I told him that if he did not sit down im- mediately I should put him in charge of a police officer. At that he caved. After meeting he came up to me and said that it was the weight of his responsibility under which he was laboring which induced him to rise. I replied that it was just such a responsibility as the Devil had ever felt. He evidently intended to arouse, if possible, a feeling of sympathy in the minds of the people in his favor, but he failed most signally, and when he was compelled to sit down I caught sight of an expression on his face of baffled and disappointed hate. Not knowing where he might direct his steps I wrote a circular to the Presiding Elders throughout the mission, putting them on their guard against the insidious approaches of such "wolves in sheeps' clothing." I warned them particularly against permitting themselves, or any of the Elders and Saints under their jurisdiction, bto be drawn into a arg discussuion with this man or any others with similar pretensions, telling them to adopt the let-them-alone-severely policy. I learn by letter from Elder West Bromwich last Sunday, in company with some old apostates, and arose to "say a word by way of bearing testimony," but they ^(the brethren)^ had been put upon their guard by the counsel which had been given, and they would allow no such thing. After meeting he wanted to  speak, and attempted to inweigh against Polygamy. The Doctrine and Covenants, Book of Mormon and the Bible were about to be appealed to, when the brethren told him to desist at once, and they ordered the room to be cleared, as meeting was  over. It was in this town where he married his wife before he ENDENTRY Vernon F. King ENDENTRY (5)  emigrated to the Valley. He has been shown no quarters, how- ever, by any of our people, and will, I am confident, do us more good in the end than harm. I felt to predict this when I first knew of his arrival. My teachings to the Elders and Saints have been, not to descend from the dignity of their positions to argue and hold controversy, neither with the Devil nor with those filled with his Spirit; nothing can be gained, I have told them, by reasoning with apostates, men who have known the Truth and denied it and forfeited the Spirit of the Lord and yielded them- selves up to the spirit of the Evil One. I have a thorough and deep grounded dislike to these miserable liars and covenant breakers—so many of whom are to be found within the bounds of this "New Organization." They are a base crew of malignant, bloodthirsty creatures who were so corrupt years ago, that they could not bear to see holiness and purity and virtue exist em- bodied in human nature, and therefore sought to shed the blood of those who cherished these principles. I regret greatly thant any of the children or relatives of our beloved prophet should be connected in any way with such a crowd, many of whom sought and rejoiced over the death of their father. I feel convinced, however, that circumstances are being so overruled that they, or at least a portion of them, will yet have their eyes open to see their true position and where alone they can find the true friends of their father and family. It is my prayer that they may be thus enlightened.  redacted wrote me a very humble letter from redacted I can scarcely reconcile its contents and the Spirit it breathes with the fact of the girl's confession at redacted ENDENTRY (6)  that she had been seduced by him. I mention this letter to you now, because in my last letter to you, I informed you that he had denied having done any wrong with any person in the Church, yet this girl had testified that he had ruined her, and as I have not seen the girl, myself, I wish him to have the benefit of the doubt in your minds which his penitent letter has rasied in mine.  Unless some counsel should come from the President to the contrary, I expect a number of the Valley Elders will be released this Spring to return home. They feel very pleased at the pros- pect of so soon enjoying the society of their families and the Saints of God. The saints are very desirous to get away this Spring; already applications from all quarters have commenced flowing in to me to know if I cannot extend them a little help to get away, some lacking more and some less money, and these applications will increase very rapidly as the time of emigration appro^a^ches. As yet, I have received no intima- tion from Brother Brigham respecting the sending down of Teams to the Frontiers to carry up the poor, and as I do not like to make any very definite moves, or to stir the people up very much upon the subject of Emigration until that arrives, we feel considerably anxious to receive some word. The people from Scandinavia are intending to come by way of Hamburg as they did last. We think the advantages are greater by this than the other route. The Work is prospering there and numbers are being added. In many Conferences, in this Mission also, the labors of the Elders are being attended with marked success. ENDENTRY (7)  Brother John L. Smith is pursuing a very wise and saving course towards the Saints and the people within the limits of his mission. When everthing is considered I think the Elders there have done and are doing remarkably well. In France Bro. Bertrand has many grave difficulties to contend with, which prevent him from being as successful in his labors as he otherwise would be. He does not appear to get discouraged or to give up trying, and occasionally baptizes a few. I proposed to him, when I was in Paris, in view of his lengthy absence from home and the almost ^utter^ indifference of the people to the message of which he is the bearer, to return home this season; but left it with himself to decide. He has since expressed a wish to remain another year. The Holland Mission, I think from present appearances, will have to be abandoned. You will doubtless recollect that Elders Paul A. Schettler were appointed ^a^ missions to Holland in the Spring of (18)61. For some time after their arrival they had but little succeess, and Bro. Vander Woude wrote some very dis- couraging letters here, in which he evinced but very little faith. Money had to be sent there to sustain them, and as I had no authority to thus use funds I mentioned the matter in a letter to the President. He counselled the withdrawal of the Elders, if they people would not receive their message. In the mean- time, however, they had baptized a few, and as prospects appeared brighter we thought it better to let them try a little  longer. As I had learned that there was difficulty in the Branch they had raised up I thought it better to visit them to while I was on the Continent, and concluded it would be ENDENTRY (8)  wise to separate the Elders and remove Bro. Schettler to labor with Bro. John L. Smith, who was much in need of his help, and with whom he could labor with greater pleasure and harmony than where he was. I investigated the difficulty, and though the principal opponent of Bro. Vander Woude evidently had a bad spirit, yet Bro. Vander Woude's course had been a very unwise one. The latter promised to do bet- ter and the difficulty was settled, only, however, to break out with greater violence, as I have since learned. One object that I supposed would be gained by the removal of Bro. Schettler would be that the Branch, as I was inform- ed by them, would be able to sustain Bro. Vander Wonde; but I have since learned that they refuse to sustain him—that is, those of them who have the means—and I have been com- pelled to forward him money to keep him from suffering. As I have no hopes respecting his accomplishing anything in that country I have deemed it better to release him to return home in the Spring. I think that the right kind of man might do good in that country, but it is without doubt, I think, a hard field.  Bros West still travel through the mission and their labors are attended with very good effects.  Accept my love to yourselves, individually, and to your families in which my wife joins.

You are all, probably, aware that I have been admitted as an attorney and counselor in the higest court of New York, and that I have since my graduation at the Law School of Columbia College devoted myself more or less to the pursuit of legal law.

I would therefore suggest to your respect- ful consideration that I be employed by you for such services in the direction indicated as I shall be able to render. After performing my military duties I shall always have time which I could spend either in consultation or research, or in such way as superior counsel might indicate. I might, if thought desirable ENDENTRY assist the Deseret News by communications and corres- pondence. It would be far more consonant with not only my own feelings but my mother's that you should indicate some direction is which I  might eillegible render you service for a stated salary rather than depend upon your charity.

Dear Brethren:  With this we return the recommends given by you to members of your Stake to be present at the dedicatory services at the Temple. We do so for the purpose that you may carefully examine them and become acquainted with the standing of the persons recom- mended. There were numbers who gained admission to these services whose lives had, for many years, been inconsistent with their calling as Saints: in fact, in some cases they were not known to be members of the Church. But their names were found on the records, fellowship had not been withdrawn from them, and they claimed the right, under the ruling of the First Presidency, to be present at the dedication. These persons having claimed this privilege by reason of their membership in the Church, it now becomes the duty of the local authorities, Bishops and others, to see that all such assume the responsibilities of their profes- sion. When, in your search through the recommends, you meet the name of any of whose standing you are in doubt, they should be labored with in the divine spirit of love and patience, and be admon- ished to repent of all that is unseemly and inconsistent with their call- ings as officers or members of Christ's Holy Church. If any turn a deaf ear to these warnings, continue in ways of indifference or sin, and they be found unworthy of membership, they should be dealt with by the  proper councils of the Church, as the word of the Lord directs, and their names should be stricken from the records, that the vineyard of the Lord may be pruned and no further opportunity given to the  unworthy to repeat the course they took to gain admission to the  Temple services.

Salt Lake City, August 18, 1894.  To the Officers and Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: Dear Brethren and Sisters:  For several years past, the Presiding Authorities of the Church, acting in conjunction with the General Board of Education, have operated toward the estab- lishment of a Church University, this institution to become the head of our Church School System, and to be equipped for the work of higher instruction. During the past two years, steps were taken toward founding and endowing such an institution as would meet the needs of the people of Utah, and particularly of the Latter-day Saints, as a denominational school of high grade; and on the 8th of September, 1893, a circular was issued announcing the opening of the Church University.  The work of the institution was conducted during the academic year 1893–4, with abundant proofs of success; and all connected with the manage- ment of the Church University had reason to anticipate for the school a brilliant future.  There was no intention on the part of the promoters of the Church University to arouse any unfair competition or rivalry between that school and the University of Utah; nevertheless, the existance of two institutions in the same city, with many courses in common, rendered the paralleling of work, and the consequent duplication of expenditure, absolutely unavoidable. Time has very plainly demonstrated the fact that Utah, while abundantly able under present conditions to maintain one well equipped institution for higher instruction, cannot adequately support many such, either in material sup- plies of means, or in students prepared for university courses of study. After due consideration of the presents conditions and future prospects of educational affairs in Utah, the presiding quorums of the Church have deemed it wise to bring the work of the Church University to a close, that greater energy, resulting from concentration of effort, may devoted to the development of our Territorial University.  Toward the University of Utah our people may properly indulge a feeling of pride; the institution was established in the early days of Utah's history; it was incorporated, indeed, under the name of the University of Deseret within less than three years after the first settlement of this region.  It has grown in spite of the numerous difficulties incident to pioneer existance, to its present fair proportions, and to the attainment of its forty-fifth year, with a steady and healthful progress which inspires strong confidence for its future.  Utah has need of such an institution of learning; indeed there appears no reason why our University should not become the great inter-mountain center for the diffusion of knowledge in advanced and special- ized branches.  We hope that the day is not far distant when the youth of ENDENTRY  AN ADDRESS  To the officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:  Dear Brethren and Sisters—It has been a practice in the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints, sanctioned by the word of the Lord, to fast and pray, and in  this manner to seek for that faith which Saints should possess, and obtain that spirit of  humility which we are commanded to cultivate.  Shortly after the arrival of the people in the valley of the Great Salt Lake, the first  Thursday in each month was set apart as a day of fasting and prayer. The members  of the Church were enjoined to bring on that day their contributations for the  relief and sustenance of the poor, and hand them to the Bishop of the ward  At the time of the adoption of this regulation it was very convenient for the  people generally to meet together in their places of worship on that day. The conditions were such that they, being of one faith, employers and employed, could leave their labor and devote a few hours to the worship of the Lord.  For many years these meetings were well attended, and they were of a  most interesting character, and were a comfort and a strength to all who  shared in them, as it was the practice for persons of both sexes to bear their testimony and take active part in them in each ward under  the direction of the bishopric.  As the years rolled by, conditions changed, and it became more  difficult for the people generally, and especially those in steady employ- ment, to attend these meetings, until at the present time they have dwindled to such an extent that comparatively few have the oppor- tunity of attending them. Thursday as a day of fasting and prayer in the Church no longer serves the object for which it was intended.  Our attention has been called to this subject, and after mature deliberation,  it has been decided to change the day that has heretofore been devoted  to this purpose. Instead of the customary assemblages in the various  wards throughout Zion on the first Thursday in each month, we have  concluded to set apart the first Sunday in every month as the day for the  regular fast meeting.  Hereafter, therefore, we desire the Latter-day Saints, under the  direction of the Presidents of the Stakes and the Bishops, to meet in  their several places of worship on the afternoon of the first Sunday  in each month, whenever it can be done conveniently, and devote the meeting to the administration of the Sacrament, to the bearing of testi- mony by the members of the Church, to the blessing of children and the  confirming of members in the Church, and to such other services as have usually been attended to at such meetings. We feel assured that excellent results will follow the giving of members of the Church  an opportunity to bear their testimony to each other and to seek for the gifts which the Lord has promised to those who keep His commandments.  Care should should also be taken on such occasions to see that the wants of the poor are relieved by the contributions of the Saints in their behalf, that no cry of the indigent or suffering shall arise from our land ENDENTRY  To The Saints.  To the officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, in General Conference assembled:  Dear Brethren and Sisters—Every Latter-day Saint will recognize the  value of union, not only in action but in matters of faith and discipline. As to the rights and authority of the Priesthood of the Son of God, it is of the  highest importance that there should be no difference of opinion among the officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. ENDENTRY Young, R. W.  Salt Lake City, Utah, October 2nd 1888.  Apostle Wilford Woodruff and Brethren of the Twelve,  Dear Brethren:  I have received your communication dated the 26th ultimo. In reply thereto I desire to inform you of my conclusion to resign from the army. I purpose entering upon the practice of law in this city on the 15th of this month, at which time I shall relinquish the allowance heretofore, for some months, granted me for my mother, which I take this oppor- tunity to thank you for. If circum- stances justify it and my services will be of any value in the present legal crusade against the Latter Day Saints, I would solicit employment for such salary as you may judge expedient.  Very respectfully, Richard W. Young. ENDENTRY "Office of The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec 18, 1895.  Prest. Angus M Cannon, Salt Lake Stake  Dear Brother:  At a meeting of the First Presidency and Council of Apostles, held on Thursday, October 31st, 1895, the following decisions were reached, and are now presented for the guidance of Presidents of Stakes, Bishops and their associate officers, and all whom they may concern.  There has been a practice, in at least one of the Stakes of Zion, of High Priests, Seventies, Elders and Priests, who may have been called to act in the capacity of Teachers, having an organization, distinct from that of the Teachers Quorum, and being presided over by a president and two counselors. The tendency of such organizations has been to assume functions belonging to the legitimate councils or quorums of the priesthood. The question submitted was, Is it proper for such organizations to exist, or to be presid- ed over in this manner? The Council felt that it was not proper, as no provision is made for them in any of the revelations of the Lord relating to church govern- ment; neither is there any necessity for them. And the Council decided that the brethren who bear the Melchisedek Priesthood, acting as Teachers, should not have a separate president and counselors, but that they should, when acting in this capacity, be presided over directly by the Bishopric, whose aids they are in all things connected with the well-being of the ward.  The second question was: At which of the meetings of the Saints should persons guilty of unchastity be required to make confession—at the general meeting of the ENDENTRY Him in newness of life, it would be well not to impose further conditions or to require that any of the Saints should be re- baptized before they can be recognized as in full fellowship; on the other hand, none should be forbidden to, in this way, renew their covenants, if they feel that by so doing they will more fully satisfy their consciences, or will receive thereby renewed strength to commence a life more faithful in the observance of God's commandments.  We desire that the Presidents of quorums should act in harmony with the Presidents of Stakes and Bishops. They should examine the rolls of their quorums and where they find men entirely neglecting the duties of their Priesthood and ignoring its responsibilities, they should take the usual action therein.  Praying the Lord to bless you with His Holy Spirit, not only in carrying out these instructions, but at all times and under all circumstances,  We remain, your Brethren in Christ  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith  First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  P.S.—We send you a number of extra copies of this circular for distribution among the Bishops and Presidents of Quorums in your Stake." ENDENTRY Utah will not longer need to journey afar in search of professional instruction; but that our own State will offer her sons and daughters ample facilities in all departments of intellectual progress.  We recommend to the Latter-day Saints that they faithfully devote their in- fluence and energy, such as might have been claimed by the University of the  Church, had wisdom dictated the continuance of that institution, to the University of Utah.  We trust that our people will sustain the Territorial University by their good words and works, and particularly by their patronage in sending thither their sons and daughters who are prepared to become students in the institution, which by law is constituted as the head of the public school system of Utah.  The officers of the University are men in whom the people have learned to repose their confidence; the Chancellor and the Regents need no encomiums from us in their responsible and honorable stations. The President and Faculty of the institution are severally of recognized abilities in their professions, and of steadfast devotion to the educational advancement of the people; they are entitled to the fullest confidence of Utah's citizens without distinction.  We feel assured that the moral influence of the University will prove of salu- tary effect, and all due attention will be paid to the training of students in the studies of true moral citizenship as well as in the subjects of purely secular instruction.  However, as the University is a public possession, the propriety of people of many sects and creeds, it would be manifestly improper to allow any species of sectarian religious instruction to be imparted within its walls, or under its auspices.  In view of these facts, and knowing, as we do, that many of the Latter-day Saints are imbued with a strong desire to have their youth instructed in theological tenets co-ordinately with secular training, we call your atten- tion to the fact that the Latter-day Saints' College, an institution which stands among the foremost of our Church Schools, is conducted in close proximity to the University, and that the very full courses of daily instruction in Theology will be offered at such hours, and under such conditions, that Latter-day Saint students who are attending the University, and others not regularly attending the College, may pursue in the latter such of these sacred studies as their ability and opportunities will permit. It is the aim of our local and gener- al educational boards to strengthen the theological department of the College, increas- ing and augmenting the courses, to meet all requirements.  We request that the Presidents of Stakes, Bishops of Wards, and other presiding officers, will cause this letter to be read in their places of public gathering; and that they will use their influence in otherwise bringing this subject before the people.  Respectfully your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F Smith  First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. ENDENTRY members of the ward, at the Fast Meeting, or the Monthly Priesthood Meeting?  It was the mind of the Council that the regulation of confessions in such cases should be left to the Bishopric of the Ward in which the wrong-doing occurs; and that each case be considered on its merits, and disposed of according to the publicity which has been given to it. For instance, where people guilty of adultery or fornication confess their sin, and their trans- gression is known only to themselves, the confession should not be made public. But where publicity has been given to it, the confession should be made before the priesthood of the ward at the regular monthly priesthood meeting; or, if it be deemed advisable by the Bishopric that a still more public confession should be made, it shall mean that the confession shall be made at the monthly Fast Meeting (which meetings are attended almost, if not, exclusively by church members) and that in no case shall confessions be made at the regular Sunday services.  The object of this restriction is to confine the confession as much as possible to the circle acquainted with the wrong-doing, and to avoid spreading the knowledge of sin, according to the revelation, which says (Doc and Cov. Sec. 42, 89) that such things "shall be done in a meeting, and that not before the world."  As a rule, therefore, where the knowledge of transgression is known to but a few, the confession (if required to be made at all) should be made at the priesthood meeting, and only in such cases where the offence has become a public scandal and reproach to the church should the more public confession be made.  We are  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo Q. Cannon Jos F. Smith." ENDENTRY in the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.  In Taberna- cle on the first Sunday in each month, we have concluded that  it will be better for that service to be dispensed with, and for  the Latter-day Saints to meet in their several wards on that after- noon, so as to give all the members of the ward, including the aged  and infirm, and others who are unable to go the Tabernacle, an  opportunity to participate in the fast meeting and share in the  blessings of the occasion. In other Stakes where general meetings are held as in this city, we suggest that they also be dispensed with  on the first Sunday of each month, and that the Saints meet in their  places of worship in the several wards.  In some places the custom has arisen to consider it a fast  to omit eating breakfast. This is not in accordance with the views and practice of the past. When fasts were observed in the early days, it was the rule to not partake of food from the previous day until af- ter the meeting in the afternoon of the fast day. In making donations  to the poor also it has been the understanding that the food that would be necessary for the two meals should be donated to the poor, and as  much more as those who are liberally inclined and have the means may feel disposed to give.  In giving this counsel to the Church upon this subject, we include all the missions where the Elders are laboring, either in the United States or  in foreign lands. We think this arrangement will suit the convenience  and circumstances of all the Latter-day Saints throughout the world, and  we would like it to be observed by all the organized branches of the Church in every land, so that our fasting and praying may be uniform and the time be understood by all.  Before closing this address to the Saints, we feel led to say that if there should be sickness or any evil resting upon or threatening the people, these  meetings furnish an excellent opportunity to bring such afflictions and troubles before the Lord. By approaching Him in the spirit of humil- ity and union, we can supplicate Him to remove these afflictions or evils from the individuals or from the people. Our past experience has proved  to us how willing our Father in Heaven is to hear our cries in the hours of  extremity and difficulty, when we approach Him in a proper spirit and  with proper faith. He is quick to hear the cries of His people, and He has prom- ised us that if we will draw near unto Him, He will draw near unto us. Such occasions as these, therefore, ought to be taken advantage of by the afflicted, whether in an individual or in a collective capacity  With constant prayers for your welfare and happiness and the prosperity of the work of God,  We are your brethren,  Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon, Joseph F. Smith.  First Presidency. ENDENTRY Feeling the necessity of a correct understanding of this principle, we deem it proper at this sixty-sixth anniversary of the organization of the Church, in these last days, to prepare and present a statement on the subject, embodying the doctrine which has always prevailed in  the Church, and our views upon it. We are prompted to adopt this course at the present time because of events which have happened during the late political contest. A great diversity of opinion on the subject  has been expressed, and even by leading Elders in the Church, which latter fact has naturally led in some instances to considerable division of sentiment.  It is of great importance that we understand each other and that there be harmony in our teachings. It is especially important that these teachings shall be in accordance with the rules and doctrines which have been taught and which have prevailed from the beginning until the present time, having not only the sanction of undisputed usage, but the approval of all faithful leaders in the Church and of Him in whose name and by  whose authority they act.  In the late exciting contest, to which reference has been made, the pres- iding authorities in some instances have been misunderstood. In other  instances they have been misrepresented, which has led to a wrongful conseption of their real views. It has been asserted too freely, and without foundation, that there has been a disposition on their part to interfere with individual liberty and to rebuke in some men a course which  was applauded in others. In a word, that they have appeared to desire to  assert and maintain an unjust and oppressive control over the actions of the members of the Church, and in thus doing have endeavored to  effect a union of Church and State. In the heat of political discus- sion, assertions have been made and arguments used conveying to the  public mind a false idea concerning the position of the officers of the Church,  and leaving the impression that there has been and was now being made an attempt to accomplish the union above referred to. Now that the  excitement has passed, and calmer reason has resumed its sway, we think it prudent to set forth, so that all may understand, the exact position occupied by the leading authorities of the Church.  In the first place we wish to state in the most positive and empha- tic language that at no time has there ever been any attempt or even  desire on the part of the leading authoritities referred to to have the Church in any manner encroach upon the rights of the State, or to  unite in any degree the functions of the one with those of the other.  Peculiar circumstances have surrouned the people of Utah. For  many years a majority of them in every portion of the Territory belonged  to one Church, every reputable member of which was entitled to hold and did hold some ecclesiastical office. It is easy to see how, to the  casual observer, it might appear singular that so many officers of  the Church were also officers of the State; but while this was in  fact the case, the distinction between the Church and the State throughout those years was carefully maintained. The President  ENDENTRY Oct 2 1888 Richard W. Young. Salt Lake City. Oct 10 1888 attended to file ENDENTRY of the Church held for eight years the highest civil office in the com- munity, having been appointed by the national administration  governor of the Territory. The first secretary of the Territory was  a prominent Church official. An Apostle represented the Territory  in Congress as a delegate during ten years. The members of the  Legislature held also offices in the Church. This was unavoidable; for the most suitable men were elected by the votes of the people, and, as we have stated, every reputable man in the entire commun- ity held some Church position, the most energetic and capable hold- ing leading positions. This is all natural and plain enough to  those who consider the circumstances; but it furnished opportunity  for those who were disposed to assail the people of the Territory to  charge them with attempting to unite Church and State. A fair investigation of the conditions will abundantly disprove the  charge and show its utter falsity.  On behalf of the Church of which we are leading officers, we desire  again to state to the members and also to the public generally, that  there has not been, nor is there, the remotest desire on our part or on  the part of our co-religionists to do anything looking to a union of Church and State.  We declare that there has never been any attempt to curtail in- dividual liberty of any of the officers or members of the Church. The  First Presidency and other leading officers did make certain sugges- tions to the people when the division on party lines took place. That movement was an entirely new departure, and it was necessary, in  order that the full benefit should not be lost which was hoped to  result from this new political division, that people who were inexperi- enced should be warned against hasty and ill-considered action. In  some cases they were counseled to be wise and prudent in the political step's they were about to take, and this with no idea of winning them againts  their will to either side.  To this extent, and no further, was anything said  or done upon this question, and at no time and under no circumstances  was any attempt made to say to voters how they should cast their ballots. Any charge that has been made to the contrary is utterly false.  Concerning officers of the Church themselves, the feeling was generally  expressed in the beginning of the political division spoken of that it would be prudent for leading men not to accept of office at the hands of the politi- cal party to which they might belong. This counsel was given to men of  both parties alike—not because it was thought that there was any im- propriety in religious men holding civil office, not to deprive them  of any of the rights of citizenship, but because of the feeling that it would be better under the circumstances which had now arisen  to avoid any action that would be likely to create jealousy and ill- feeling. A era of peace and good-will seemed to be dawning upon  the people, and it was deemed good to shun everything that could have the least tendency to prevent the consummation of this happy prospect. ENDENTRY In many instances, however, the pressure brought to bear upon efficient  and popular men by the members of the parties to which they belonged was  of such a character that they had to yield to the solicitation to accept nom- ination to office, or subject themselves to the suspicion of bad faith in their  party affiliations. In some cases they did this without consulting the  authorities of the Church; but where important positions were held, and where the duties were of a responsible and exacting character, some did seek the counsel and advice of the leading Church authorities before accept- ing the political honors tendered them. Because some others did not  seek this counsel and advice, ill-feeling was engendered, and undue and  painful sensitiveness was stimulated; misunderstanding readily followed, and as a result the authorities of the Church were accused of bad faith  and made the subjects of bitter reproach. We have maintained that  in the case of men who hold high positions in the Church, whose duties  are well defined, and whose ecclesiastical labors are understood to be  continuous and necessary, it would be an improper thing to accept politi- cal office or enter into any vocation that would distract or remove them  from the religious duties resting upon them, without first consulting  and obtaining the approval of their associates and those who preside over  them. It has been understood from the very beginning of the Church  that no officer whose duties are of the character referred to, has the right to engage in any pursuit, political or otherwise, that will  divide his time and remove his attention from the calling already  accepted. It has been the constant practice with officers of the Church to consult—or, to use our language, to "counsel"—with their brethren concerning all questions of this kind. They have not felt that they  were sacrificing their manhood in doing so, nor that they were  submitting to improper dictation, nor that in soliciting and acting upon the advise of those over them, they were in any manner doing away with their individual rights and agency, nor that to any im- proper degree were their rights and duties as American citizens  being abridged or interferred with. They realized that in accept- ing ecclesiastical office they assumed certain obligations; that among these was the obligation to magnify the office which they held, to  attend to its duties in preference to every other labor, and to devote them- selves exclusively to it with all the zeal, industry and strength they  possessed, unless released in part or for a time by those who preside over them. Our view, and it has been the view of all our predeces- sors, is that no officer of our Church, especially those in high standing,  should take a course to violate this long established practice. Rather  than disobey it, and declare himself by his actions defiantly independ- ent of his associates and his file leaders, it has always been held that it would be better for a man to resign the duties of his Priesthood; and we entertain the same view to-day.  In view of all the occurrencies to which reference has been made, and  to the diversity of views that have arisen among the people in consequence, ENDENTRY We feel it to be our duty to clearly define our position, so there may be  no cause hereafter for dispute or controversy upon the subject:  First—We unanimously agree to and promulgate as a rule that  should always be observed in the Church and by every leading official thereof, that before accepting any position, political or otherwise, which  would interfere with the proper and complete discharge of his ecclesi- astical duties, and before accepting a nomination or entering into  engagements to perform new duties, said official should apply to the  proper authorities and learn from them whether he can, consistently with  the obligations already entered into with the Church upon assuming his office, take upon himself the added duties and labors and responsibili- ties of the new position. To maintain proper discipline and order  in the Church, we deem this absolutely necessary; and in asserting  this rule, we do not consider that we are infringing in the least de- gree upon the individual rights of the citizen. Our position is that  a man having accepted the honors and obligations of ecclesiastical office in the Church cannot properly of his own volition make  those honors subordinate to or even co-ordinate with new ones of an  entirely different character; we hold that unless he is willing to counsel with and obtain the consent of his fellow-laborers and presiding officers in the Priesthood, he should be released from all obligations associated with the latter, before accepting any new position.  Second—We declare that in making these requirements of  ourselves and our brethren in the ministry, we do not in the least desire to dictate to them concerning their duties as American citi- zens, or to interfere with the affairs of the State; neither do we consider that in the remotest degree we are seeking the union of Church and State.  We once more here repudiate the insinuation that there is or ever has been an attempt by our leading men to trespass upon  the ground occupied by the State, or that there has been or is the wish to  curtail in any manner any of its functions.

Hooperville, Sep 29th 1887  Elder Wilford Woodruff  Dear Sir In searching the Book of Doctrine and Covenants I find a revelateaion wherein the Lord says, Behold verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received a commandment for a law unto my church through him whom I have appointed unto you to receive revelations and commandments from my hand. But verily, verily, I say unto you, that none else shall be appointed unto this gift, except it be through him, for if it be taken from him, he shall not have power except to appoint another in his stead. And this shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of any that shall come before you as revelations or commandments. And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived, that you may ENDENTRY as heretofore assumed by the church.  We respectfully submit the matter to you for your consideration, and will cheerfully endorse any decision you may arrive at in the premises.  Before closing this letter, permit us in behalf of the family to express our thanks for the prompt and generous ^manner^ which characterized the funeral arrangements of the late President John Taylor and for the liberal expenditure of means and labor devoted to the construction of ^the^ Granite Sarcophagus enclosing his remains.  In regard to Trust property, should there be any, now remaining in the name of President John Taylor as Trustee in Trust for the Church of Jesus Christ of ENDENTRY know they are not of me. This is very plain, and this law is in force to day upon the church as much as it was in the day it was given.  And it is the imperative duty of every member in this church to know that another has been appointed unto this gift through the Prophet Joseph Smith, or according to this law, we must reject the message, or great will be the condemnation of this people. This brings us to the great and important question, Did the Prophet Joseph Smith confer this gift upon another? There is an order in this church that every man can show his authority, and the office to which he has been appointed. It is by the laying on of hands by one halding holding the author- ity. Every person in this church that claims authority must be able to show how he received it. The Prophet Joseph Smith plainly showed and proved by witnesses his right to what he claimed.  Now every person in this church should be able to  answer this question, Did the Prophet Joseph Smith lay his hands upon another and bestow this gift upon him? In this we must not be mistaken. ENDENTRY Latter-day Saints, we would take pleasure, at any time; in transferring the same to any whomsoever you may designate  Trusting we shall be favored with an answer at your earliest convenience and praying for your continual welfare we remain.  Yours very respectfully  George J. Taylor John W. Taylor  Executors of the Estate of President John Taylor Deceased. ENDENTRY The welfare of this church depends upon a knowledge of this. In another revelation it says. But, behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, no one shall be appointed to receive commandments and revelations in this church, excepting my servant Joseph Smith, jun, for he receiveth them even as Moses. We all know that Moses received commandments and revelations for a law to guide and govern all Israel until Christ come in the flesh. The people knew that Moses talked with the Lord, and they knew that his word was the word of the Lord therefore they must be obedient to it. We can see by reading the ##Numbers 27:18-23|27th chap of Numbers## how the Lord dealt with the people, that they might not be deceived. Before Moses went away the Lord said to him. Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, as man in whom is the spirit and lay thine hand upon him, And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation and give him a charge in their sight. And then shalt put some of thine honor upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. And he laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, ENDENTRY Geo. J. Taylor John W. Taylor 25 Oct. 1887 ENDENTRY I will say here that the Priesthood which Moses received under the hand of his father-in-law Jethro and Jethro received it under the hand of Caleb and so back to Esaias who received it under the hand of God. This is the High Priesthood which is the greatest of all. ##Doctrine and Covenants 84:6-7## Moses confered this branch of the Holy Priesthood upon the Prophet Joseph Smith which is for the gathering of Israel, the establishment of Zion, and the building of holy temples, and  leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north. ##Doctrine and Covenants 110:11## All other branches of the Priesthood are appenda- ges to this. The High Priesthood is a local office, to take charge of the affairs of Zion and her stakes to be assisted by the lesser Priesthood to see that that her laws are kept which will sanctify the people and prepare them to redeem Zion. Then the Twelve and Seventies are a travelling ministry to preach the gospel in all the world. The Twelve Apostles holds the keys of this ministry. This is ENDENTRY plainly written in the Book of Doctrine and Cov- enants, and it also agrees with a decision of the Prophet Joseph Smith, at a grand Council held in Kirtland May 2nd 1835 which says that President  Joseph Smith then stated, That the Twelve will have no right to go into Zion or any of her stakes and there undertake to regulate the affairs thereof, where there is a standing High Council but it is their duty to go abroad and regulate all matters relative to the different branches of the church. No standing High Council has authority to go into the churches abroad and  regulate the matters thereof for this belongs to the Twelve. Showing their two distinct fields of labor, and the specific duties belonging to each branch of the Priesthood. There should be great weight placed upon all the decisions of the Prophet Joseph, for the Lord says He has inspired him to lay the foundation of this church and to build it up unto the most holy faith. And the Lord also ENDENTRY says, Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt  give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them walking in all holiness before me, For his word ye shall receive as if from mine own mouth in  all patience and faith; For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you, yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and ^cause^ the heavens to shake for your good and His name's glory.  We can see that the blessings of the Lord depends upon our obedience to the word of the Lord revealed  through Joseph Smith. How essential it is that we search this great law and that it is taught to the people and that this church is set in order according to the revelations and commandments which we have received.  The reason I have for writing this letter to you is because of the anxiety I have for the welfare of this people. I have written with the earnest feelings of my heart in the fear of the Lord knowing that what I have written is true.

I have just written a letter to Brother Asahel one object I have in view in writing at this time is to inform you of my present calculations and  intentions. A person situated as I am in life and calling Does not at  all times know what a day or a month will bring forth or where they may  be called to stand in defence of the truth. I held two conferences  the middle of April upon fox Island and organized a Church upon each of  the Islands and left them in a situation to attend to their meetings while I  am absent the two Churches number about 50 members being the fruits of my labour during the past season and in consequence of recieving  some intelligence from Elder Parley P. Pratt now preaching in the City of  New York. I have left the Islands for the purpose of visiting that City and am  now at Father Carters house Phebe has spent the winter with me upon the  Islands she returned home by water the 20th of April at that time I expected to have  spent the Summer upon the Islands but on recieving intelliegence from NY. I  left the Islands on the 28 of April and returned to father Carters in company with Elder Milton Holmes on the 1st of May I intend to persue my journey on Monday I am expect- ing to visit Holiston and the City of NY, as the work of God is pro- gressing in those places and it is my present calculation to visit you in conn- ectcut either going or on my return I felt last season that an opportunity would  offer for me to visit you again and I now feel as though that time is nigh. I am  expecting to lead a company of Saints from the Islands to the City far West Mo next September I expect Phebe will accompany me to Missouri if her circumstances  will admit which I trust will be the case. She would be glad to visit you this season but I suppose will not be able to. She sends her respects to you and Sister Eunice and  all who inquire. I was highly edifyed with the reading of your last letter should  you write to me again please direct to Scarborough Maine as Phebe will  ENDENTRY I would not want any funeral or any child to see the corps this may seem hard but no so hard as to have to follow all the children with grace, it is far more Dangerous than the small pox and almost as contagious you have had it twice I hope you may not have it again or any of the family I seen a Note in one of the papers that it was in the family of James Woodruff but I heard no thing from it afterwards I understand that Julia is getting Better well I suppose Asahel is coming home while I am very glad of, the company will leave Liverpool on Saturday the 24.

The work of God has finally taken a strong hold in the City of Pratt writes that 75 have been added to the church in the City and that the work has but just begun I am now Baptizing day and night we have two meeting houses that we occupy and we preach every  Sunday in Tamany Hall the most noted Hall in the City we are crowded beyond conception some people come 20 or 30 miles to hear and obey the gospel. as to opposition the City is in a general uproar in many parts. The priests rage and foam and many  of them go to such length that every honest man is driven to the necessity of com- ing out from them. Many newspapers and two pamphlets are filled against us I have replyed to Mr Sunderlands peices in the Zions Watchman in a pamphlet of 42 pages which I wish to be circulated wharever that paper has gone. Visions, Tongues, prophesying, and healings are manifest in this City the desiples are firm in the faith in this place and are ready to suffer death for Christ sake and the truth, there is more calls in the City as well as con- ntry than we can possibly attend to. These with many other good things Brother Pratt says in this letter. So I am now on my way to visit him a short time I shall calculate to call at Farmington in May or June if the Lord will and pay you a visit.

Azubah Woodruff,  Dear Parents  While the Sun is sheding his brilliant rays to gladden earth, and the Saints thronging the streets of Kirtland on their way to worship in the Temple of the Lord I avail myself of the opportunity (in company with my wife) of spending a few leasure moments of again addressing you with my pen. I said in company with my wife. I am sensible that a remark of this kind from my pen is unexpected and unlooked for by you unless the paper bearing the account of my marriage th hath fallen into your hands be that as it may suffice it to say that I was married on the 13th of April 1837, to Miss Phebe W. Carter, from the State of Joseph Smith jun  in Kirtland the ceremony solemnized by F. G. Williams, Esq. My wife is a tayloress by trade which occupation she has closly followed for the last seven years her time for several seasons previous was spent in teaching school. We are both of us old enough to be wise their is as many days differance in our ages as God was making the heavens and the Earth. I was born March 1st  1807, my wife  was born March 8th 1807 making her 7 days the youngest. Perhaps you may wonder at my taking upon me the marriage covenant considering my calling in life I should not have taken such a step had I not been fully convinced it was the will of God neither will it (or some might suppose) ever hinder me from cleaning my garments of the blood of this generation or finishing my mission to Jew or gentile. My wife is enjoying good health peace, and contentment, and sends her respects to you who have become her parents by law although strangers unto her she wishes to be remembered to sister Eunice. She has a desire to visit you all which I trust may yet be the case. I am enjoying good health which hath ever been the case since I left you. I have not herd from any of you for a long time. I have written to you and several of my relatives since I returned to Kirtland but have not received answers I received a letter from Brother Asahel AsDated Dec 16th1836 Terre Haute he wished to corresspond with me I wrote him two letters since but received no answer perhaps he did not receive them I wrote a letter to Brother Azmon also but herd nothing from him since you wrote to me in Tennessee I have spent the winter in school but am expecting to spend the summer in the vineyard of the Lord The route which I expect to take this season (unless some unforeseen circumstance should change it) is as follows one week from monday I expect to take water on lake Erie for black River country ENDENTRY Oct 16 1887  My Dear Blanch  I will write a few lines to you and ask of you get your reciept for the May you paid for your tuition Alice has been by if became Ma want not Let her go to Brother Richies to ply or visit and had to give her 50 cents to stay and visit with me Ma says you went to meeting on Sunday so I suffered you saw me at Medy a start tome I did not know you was there and would like to have seen you but I  hope to see you some day I hope you get along well in school I Expect you get all your lessons well I hope you will get a good Education and Make a good smart  woman I Expect you will.

I expect to spend two or three months in Connecticut during the season I shall endeavor to visit my relatives in the East universally this season if the Lord will from Connecticut I expect to visit the the State of Maine and attend a con- ference there.  I expect to visit my wifes relatives in Maine whare I expect to meet Mrs. Woodruff who is expecting to accompany some friends to that state and will spend the time with her parents and friends untill I arive We may then return to Kirtland by way of Connecticut and visit you together this is what I desire to do if nothing hinders. I have long desired to visit you and the rest of my relatives in the east and I trust that God may open my way before me this season that I may have the desires of my heart in this thing that I may speak and answer for myself in all things pertaining to the Kingdom of God. my motive would not be seeking for honour in my own country for I should not expect to obtain it for if a prophet could not find honour in his own country how could a Teacher expect it, yet I feel for my kindred those bound to me by the ties of consangu- inity I desire to proclaim unto them the words of Eternal the greatest gift of God and warn them of things as they are in these last days that my garments may be clean of their blood and the blood of all men leaving the event with God that peradventure I may be an instrument in the hands of God of bringing some of my relatives into the New and everlasting covenant I know not but it may be the last mission among my kindred that I  shall be privileged with therefore I pray God to grant me success this once Time flies. the gentiles are ripe in iniquity and prepared for judgment.

You will notice in the papers I sent you that the work of the Lord has commenced in England and I learn from late letters that it is progressing with speed. I view an important day at hand even the day of the gathering of Israel and bloody wars and other judgments upon the gentiles The Lord is about to take peace from the earth and there hath already a lying spirit gone forth among men to stir them up to anger one against another The signs in the heavens and Earth all indi- cate the near approach of the Son of God greater darkness never covered Egypt than now covers the professed Christian world they neither believe in nor are looking for the timr and literal fulfillment of the word of God con- sequently it will over take them as a thief in the night. Had we the tongue of Angels and the zeal of Apostles, possessing the intelligence of heaven, with our hearts expanding wide as eternity, and our bosoms burning with the love of God and commissioned to bear as glad tidings as was ever borne by Michael the Ark Angel. It would be as much impossible to fill our mission and deliver our message in a manner to be recieved and approbated by the majority of this generation, as it was for ST Paul while at Ephesus declairing glad tidings of a Crusified and risen redeemer, while his voice was lost amid the day of the Ephesians that great is the goddess Diana. ##Acts 19:23-41## I have a great anxiety for the spiritual well fare of my relatives and that they may be prepared for the unparalled judgments, and august events that are rolling upon the heads of this generation. I wished to be remembered to Sister Eunice I suppose she is either teaching or attending school. I learn that Brother Smith have dissolved pardonsip partnership and that Asahel attends to his Book business alone I have had some interesting and satisfactory letters from Asahel during the past winter I am in hopes his mind will yet incline to the things of God. I want an interest in all of your prayers I remember you all before a throne of Grace May the peace of God abide with you all and lead you into all truth for Christ Sake  Azubath Woodruff From your Son Willford Woodruff ENDENTRY to bear the sound of the gospel and be warned that the hour of judgment may come. I expect soon to be called to accompany my brethren to that land perhaps by the opening of another spring thes things may appear as idle tales to thousands and perhaps to my kindred but when horid famine desolates the east and every man's sword raised against his nei ghbour through the land while all law is but a mame and pestilence wastes the harts of men Earthquakes and horible tempest desolates cities and villages. the reflecting mind of none others during the fulfillment of thes things will begin to believe that there is a gGod in Israel who reveals himself in these last days and that He hath a prophet in the land. I desire the temporal and spiritual welfare of all my friends I would not lead or wish to see them led into any error or evil I expect they will all act as agents for themselfes I expect to do the same I have peculiar feelings for them all I marvel at the great events of these last days that have and are transpiring I view a special hand of God in dealing with me through life I am experiencing the fulfillment of many of my former impression which were dictated by the spirit of truth. I receieved the gospel of Jesus Christ as proclaimed by the Latter Day Saints the first time I herd it from that day to the present I have no doubts upon the subjects yea I know it to be the work of God and although the gentiles rage the prests imagine thousands vain things a flood of evil epithets and falshoods heaped upon our heads and perils, of fals brethers and some dishonor the Holy priesthood and their anointing by breaking the commandments of God and acting wickedly I say notwithstanding all these things the work of God still rolls on in this place and all places whare the word is faithfully preached the stone rolls the kingdom grows there has seldom a sabbath passed by us since I have been in Kirtland but what numbers have been added to the church the work is still progressing with rapidity in the English dominions and all places whare it is proclaimed. Latest accounts from Missouri said it was a time of health great plenty and prosperity and universal peace with all men the Saints have settled a county by themselves at present they are still constantly gathering, with prosperity their will be a large city there in Kirtland soon as the saints are building fast. But I must draw to a close give my respects to all enquiring friends I wish to be remembered to sister Eunice you may look for me during the season, if the Lord will I shall endeavour to visit you.

I aem much rejoiced to hear from you and your family that you are all alive in the land of the living and enjoying the inestimable blessing of good health. and, it is with pleasure that I embrace the opportunity of answering your letter, ecp^ect^ing to be able to give you some information,  which you earnestly desire and which may be some consolation while far away in a distant land. I have both good and bad news to communicate, but nothing so bad as I think you have apprehended. We your friends are all alive, some enjoying comfortable health while others still partake of the cup of affliction, with many comforts mingled. I will give you an account of each and any one agreeable to your request, inasmuch as I have received intelli- gence myself. I will commence with our family who are among the number of the afflicted  There has been no very material change with us. Mother remains about the same if any  differance in her situation it is for the worse—It appears to me that her ease is a peculiar one. she seems to have all reason and yet no reason, knows evry^thing^ and knows nothing. I do not know what to think about her, sometimes I have a good degree of confidence to believe that she will recover and sometimes I doubt, at all times I place much dependance on the faith of my friends. If it can be consistant will the will of God and his purposes concerning us. I earnestly desire that my mother may be restored to health and to the right use of her reason. If such a blessing is ever mine know assur^e^dly that I am happy. My health is about the same as when I wrote. Sister Ann is about par with me she has been much afflicted during the past winter with a nervous tooth-ache which has reduced her strength very much, but we have been ennabled by the help of God to bear all that has been laid upon us and are still able to do our necessary housework, but I think my health has been poorer since you left than ever before, as has been the case with Sister Ann. Brother Bulah since late in the fall, but understand her health has been poor through the winter. we are expecting her here daily. I have heard nothing particular from Uncle Ozem's family, they are living in Lovely street, and I conclude well. I have learned by the bye that Mr Herd is dead, no other connexions. I have had somwhat recent intelligence ^both^ from Mother, directed to us and dated March 30 from which I will make some extracts, by so doing give you all the information I am in possession of respecting those distant friends. "We have been some disappointed in our earthly expectations the year past but tho we were some cast down for a time yet we have not been forsaken, we have enjoyed ourselves notwithstanding as well as formerly, we have a plenty of house room tolerably convenient and enough to eat and drink and we have been favored with having good news from our children at Nauvoo. We received a letter short time since under Date of Feb 9th and March 16th. the greatest part being dictated by Webster being scribe and addressed ENDENTRY to she writes that as to her health it had not been as well since they last wrote (being then able to do some light work) untill a week past the circumstances of which she says she will mention. Mr. Webster having joined the Carriage and Coach association came home one night from his buisness and said that Brother Roberts (the one who kicked up such a bobery in New York by an evil spirit getting hold of him) said to him in view of his being detained from his work by sickness in his family that if he would come down next Monday he would prophecy in the name of the Lord that he and his wife would both get well, that she was rather disposed to make light of it as she thought him to be possessed of rather an aspiring mind that on account of her former prejudices and prepositions thought probable he spok in his own name instead of by the power of the Priesthood. I said to Br Frost a member of the association a few nights after words Br. R. is going to have us healed right off he said Roberts had a good spirit that night. I can tell when he has a right spirit, I believe he did speak in the name of the Lord. this she says set me a thinking for I knew frost was on the Look out for him as well as we, the next week on Sunday she says which was a week ago to day some one rapped at the door and I was introduced to Br Roberts. Among other things he enquired about my health and said he thought if I would have a little more faith I could get well, I told him if I had a great deal I thought I might, told him she had had quite a spirit of labor for her health 2 or 3 days past more so than usual, he said that might be accounted for, that the Brethren fo the associaton had been praying for her, she says her prejudice began to wear away and said to him is your mind led to pray for me, would it be led to administer to me at my request, that he accordingly did so, and it was evident that he had the spirit of the Lord, his prayer being very appropriate to her case, he pronounced the blessing of health upon me and said I should begin from that time to gain andc that he told her afterwards if she would begin to excercise, be sure and do enough be carful and not do too much, he would promise her she should soon be better, this was the substance of the matter and she found his words to prove true, she went to work the next day and had been quite smart through the week washing dishes cooking and c she then writes under date March 16th about five weeks from the commencement of her letter and says she has the took a good deal aside from that she is quite smart, says Dwight goes to his work after breakfast and she gets along through the day with the chores and gets supper ready against he gets home. I am rejoiced to learn that there is so good a prospect of E's getting her health. she says (in referance to my informing her that we had received a letter from Father an invitation to go and live by or near them andc) she says give my love to him and tell him as bad as the Mormans be I would not be dep- rived of being with the body of the saints on any account whatever and then adds, I have much I would like to say upon principle but cannot do it by letter, prepare yourselves for great things prepare yourselves for great doctrine, prepare yourselves for becoming rid of many tradisions. I had tradition when I came to Nauvoo, which I am trying hard to get rid of the fact is she says the laws of the Celestial Kingdom are such that but few of even the siants will be able to abide them, but my faith is not shaken at all in the work. I have been deprived of the privilege of going to meeting yet notwithstanding I have learned many things which I could not have learned in public. this from Willford's family, now from Brother Page's one of the twelve who lives in the house with us, only a door separates us, they are fine family. they have a young woman boarding with them who came from Boston last fall, her Mother is a rich widow woman worth about 15000 she sacrificed friends and property.  Mr Webster has joined the Carriage and Coach association, which they think will help them to get a comfortable living for their family I have just referred above to the invitation we received not long since from Azmon to live with him or by him, he wrote very affectionately and gave us a handsome invitation to go there, thought his father could have a plenty of work if he wished in his saw mill and shingle mill which he designs to get in operation by June but wishes us to act in accordance with out own feelings on the subject not wishing to urge us contrary to our minds, but thinks it would be our best way to come over if we intended to go to Nauvoo some day, but we do not now think of going to Richland, we do not have a  letter yet Wilford which I think rather strange of" I was very glad to get the above information, wish I could see the letter I intended to write to them ere long, if I can find myself composed enough. It is hard for me to write amidst so much confusion and I cannot get away from it. I have received no other news from Nauvoo except what I occasionally get from the Prophet dont you occasionally get that paper? If so you may be as well informed respecting Nauvoo and the prosperit of the caus of God abroad as myself as it is through that medium I get nearly all the information I am in possession of. I should judge from that paper things were going on tolerably well in general and that in many places the work is prospering much, especially in Clinton Ct. and in other places the work is progressing. there was a  Branch of the church organized in Hartford last winter of 7 or 8 members, ^and more believing^ whether they have ben added to the church since I do not know. All the information I have gained respecting the work there was from Brother Sparks, and Burnham who visited us last winter. ^number times^ visited Weatouge but was not able to accomplish much on account of the prejudice of the minds of the people. They made an appointment in Farmington, none attended but the Saints. I think they preached once in Avon twice in Weatogue and once in Hopmeadow, the first in Weatogue I could not attend, but went to the second I can assure you I as happy as a lark on my way and untill near the close of the meeting when my joy was turned to distraction. There was a large congregation, some of the principal ones left before the close of the sermon Perhaps becasue the speaker was lengthy; but while he was making his closing remarks all of a sudden there was a stamping hooting laughing and all sorts of music. Br Sparks undertook to reason with the leader, some conversation ensued rough enough too on the part of the enemy which consisted of the school teacher and some of his scholars none very apt but himself soon the lights were blown out I was in a sorry predicament nearly all had left but the mobbers and I knew not what to do as blank my Brother C. who accom- panied he had retired unnoticed. I appreached the stand and enquired of Br Burnham what I should do, by this time one light was blown up again by Br Sparks, Br B took it in one hand gave me the other and told me to follow him. we went down stairs being saluted on the way found Brother Cyrus near the door waiting for me and watching his horse, he left the meeting on account of feeling somewhat ill and found it necessary to remain with or near his horse. So much for the prosperity of Mormonism in Weatogue I believe they will go to destruction by wholesale. They behaved more respectfully in Hopmeadow Indeed they would scorn such things but the weath- er was extremely cold and but few people attended. I have heard no fault found with any thing that was advanced  and no comments whatever except from 1 or 2 young people who observed that he was quite a talker I believe they was somewhat confounded by the doctrines held forth but then he was noboddy but a Mormon. They visited us again and proposed holding another meeting, applied for the better schoolhouse (a dwelling house occupied for school) ENDENTRY but was refused on the plea of blank beining no buisness to let it they would not accept of the old house on account of its being so cold and uncomfortable, had we been well I would kept them preaching in our house as long as they would stay whether any body attended or not (this last visit of which I have been speaking was the day they preached in Weatouge I have neither seen or heard from these Brothers since, perhaps they have gone to Hartford he removed his family there last fall. Respecting who has the care of other churches I do not know as there has been a special call from the west for the Elders generally to repair to Nauvoo to spend the summer, working on the Temple andc andc I expect those who could go have gone leaveing the care of branches with those who could not go. I rejoice that Elder Pratt has taken the Presidency of the churches in this eastern land. I think much good will be the result. I had forgotten to speak of Westfield and Windson I believe some have been added to the Churches there. I have greatly desired that something might be done in this place. I think Brother Sparks would have made further effort had it not been for expences I did all I could for him but could not do much for reasons which I will not name however we furnished them with what they needed during their visits (or principally) excepting lodging that was procured at the public house at their own expence and they was nearly destitute of means. I greatly desire to be in a situation to enter- tain my bretheren especially those who are destitute, by so doing I should ^be^ comforted edified and benefitted.  Doubtless you have heard of the unconditional repeal of the Nauvoo Charter and also that the Temple has been progressing rapidly. They are expecting to commence the endowment soon as the first of December next. If Eunice enjoys health I think she will have a good time this Summer, she seems to value her privileges I could ^saih^ I was there to share with her, how ^much^ should value the society of the saints no one can easily immagine, I think I could fully appreciate such blessings. But although I am deprived of many Privileges and have to wander alone through life's uneven ways, weary and worn. I often rejoice in the anticipation of a future day, when saints will meet and be forever blest.  I wish all my friends to understand that I remain as firm in the faith and doctrines of the Latter day saints as at the begin- ning that I have not renounced or been shaken in no one principle that I ever embraced Mormonism is my glory in time and I hope it will be in eternity, but I oftentimes get discouraged and fear I shall not be found worthy. I neglected to speak particularly respecting your Mother's health. In general I believe they have enjoyed comfortable health but sometimes complaining. She writes in her last as follows, "I should have written you ere this had it been possible under existing circumstances. I have a great deal to do this winter of work left behind on account of our past sickness, I have sat up most of the time at night untill 12 o clock and after and have not got necessary things done yet, my health not very good not but better than it was a few weeks since, I had a seated pain in my side for 3 or 4 weeks and was afraid I should get sick with pleurisy or Lung fever which has prevailed here, but have been delivered from ^those^ symptoms. Capt Richards Cowl was buried yesterday and Mr Camp last week." She did not speak "of your Father," I should not wonder if he failed and dink splot suddenly. If reports are true respecting your stay on this mission doubtless you will never see your Father ink splot It was reported in the Prophet and also by Brother Sparks that you expected to stay five years, that is a long time. ink splot dire changes may take place ere that period expires. I get the Prophet regularly and it is a source of great coink splot It a very interesting and instructive paper, containing much upon principle and doctrine that I never had an understand- ing of before. there was one piece entitled, "Celestial family organization: that was noble. it was written by Elder Pratt of New York he teaches things both new and old and I am ready to receive it. I think people ougth to be instructed as they are able to receive. Cousin Eunice says the laws of the Celestial kingdom are such that but few of the saints can abide them. How can I abide a law that I have no knowledge of, I desire knowledge and instruction beyond what I have means to obtain. Wonder how you and Cousin Phebe would feel if you could not ever see a Mormon from one end of the year to the other. I guess some like me. Your Father and mother, and myself desire to go the west in pursuit of a more congelial clime, but not to Richland. Hereafter I do not expect to enjoy the privileges for information that I have done three numbers more will close the first volume of the Prophet. The price is increased to two dollars per annum, which with 75 cts postage will be too much for me to pay under my limited circumstances, being in no buisness. The Prophet will hereafter be printed in Boston ^386 Washington Street^ the same as in New York. I think the churches do well in regard to their tithing and donations five hundred dollars was sent to N. York at one time from Boston, they are all zealously engaged in cause of the Temple. 25 were added to the church in N. York at one time mostly, youths and children. the last account from St. Lewis 10 had recently been baptized by Elder O Hyde at one time, which the congregation stood as solemn witnessess and many of then overwhelmed in tears. Elder Philadelphia under date of March 22nd he informs us that the Saints there, are generally engaged for the welfare of Zion and are doing well for the Temple and for the laws in the west and they are increasing in numbers in that City and are baptizing new converts from time to time. Several hundred of tithing for the Temple was sent from that city by Elder Fordham, who came on a special mission and has returned to the west. she following extracts of a private letter Dated Nauvoo 6th of April, the Prophet copies, (just now received) "The Temple is rolling up with rapidity and bids fair for a speedy completion. The saints around here seem to take an active interest in it, and each one manifests a willingness to do all they can. It is a general time of health with us and we yet enjoy peace, notwithstanding the clattering of the rattlesnakes of Carthage and surrounding mud ponds. It is true they threaten hard and appear to be making active preparations to do somthing, and I suppose if they could do as they want to, the poor Mormons, would all be greased over and swallowed up before summer comes, but the saints feel calm and unmoved having their trust in that God who has defended this Church for the last fifteen years, and the Priesthood from the days of Adam. Ther appears to only one feeling among the saints here and that is to do the will of God finish the Temple and Nauvoo house and love and defend each other, there is a good spirit prevails in Nauvoo and things look about right." I will just mention that there has been destructions by fire of late in the adjoining states, but none so large and destructive as in Pittsburgh 20 square miles burnt millions of property, destroyed I expect the Rigdonites are burnt over, and also many buildings destroyed by lightning. This reported that England that England and America are going to war. I wish you would occasionally send us the Millenial Star. If you have sent any papers we have not received them. Whenever you feel disposed to write us, a letter would meet with a very ^welcome^ reception and I hoppe you will write your Father and Mother often, it will do them good, while deprived of the society of all their children. If you ever get through with reading this and do ever write again, do take a little larger bit of paper and give us all the news you have. Sister Ann said the thought paper was rather scarce in your country.

As rumors have been circulated and published, accusing the Presidency of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints with interference in politi- cal affairs, so as to control elections and to direct members of the Church as to which political party they should sup- port, we hereby declare these rumors to be false and without foundation in  fact. We emphatically deny that we, or either of us, authorized Mr. George F. Gibbs or any other person or persons to use our names so as to influence citizens to vote the Republican ticket,  at Logan or elsewhere. If our  names have been used in any such way, it has been entirely without permission from us, and we  hereby condemn it as wrong and re- prehensible. If we have any desire  in this matter it is that the people of this Territory shall study well the prin- ciples of both the great national par- ties, and then choose which they will  join, freely, voluntarily and honestly, from personal conviction, and then stand by it in all honor and sincerity. Each party should have the same rights, privileges and opportunities as the other. If any man claims that it is the wish of the First Presidency that a Democrat shall vote the Republican ticket, or a Republican the Democra- tic ticket, let all people know  that he is endeavoring to deceive the public and has no authority of that kind from us. We have no disposition to direct in these matters, but proclaim that, as far as we are con- cerned, the members of this Church are entirely and perfectly free in all  political affairs. But they should not indulge in in ill-feeling or personalities. President George Q. Cannon is absent, but we are sure that if he were here he would sign this declaration with us.

T., April 17th, 1891.  President Elmina S. Taylor and Counselors:  DEAR SISTERS: We have noted with pleasure the advancement made in your magazine, "The Young Woman's Journal," and are aware of the great mission it has before it among our young sisters of Zion. We heartily commend it to the consideration of the young people, and will add that the  fathers and mothers in Israel may also find profit in the perusal of its pages.  May God bless you and those as- sociated with you in this important labor, and may your efforts to en- lighten and refine the youth of Israel be increasingly prospered, is the prayer of your brethren,  WILFORD WOODRUFF, GEO. Q. CANNON, JOSEPH F. SMITH. ENDENTRY  AN OFFICIAL ENDORSEMENT.  On the 5th of the present month, to the great  surprise of the public, the following official en- dorsement of Col. Isaac Trumbo appeared as a  leading editorial in the News. People were  still wondering what it meant when the Colonel  was made the topic of discourse in the Taber- nacle last Sunday afternoon. Here is the letter:  There have been many communications of late  in the newspapers concering Colonel Isaac Trumbo and his affairs. Charges have been  made, emanating from various sources, that there  has been some financial connection between him- self and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day  Saints. It has been repeatedly stated in years  past, and the story has been revived of late, that  Colonel Trumbo has had large amounts of money  in his hands and under his control belonging to  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; that he has been its agent in the expenditure of  funds for the accomplishment of certain ends  that were desired to be achieved.  We have remained silent upon this subject. It is well known that from time to time charges  are made and circulated concerning us and our  affairs, which we deem it unnecessary to notice. It would be occupying too much of our time to  be contradicting stories which are put in circula- tion by one and another for their own purposes.  This feeling has restrained us in the past in rela- tion to Colonel Trumbo and his connection with  us and our affairs. But it seems to be proper now, and just to ourselves, as well as common  justice to him, that we should say something in relation to the association that has existed be- tween Colonel Isaac Trumbo and ourselves as the  representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints.  First of all we wish to state most emphatically  that Colonel Trumbo has not had property of  ours in his possession FOR SUCH PURPOSESES AS AL- LEDGED. He has neither been our financial agent, nor had any control of our property. We  have not entrusted him with amounts of money  to expend for us FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE.  In the time of our deep distress, when bitter- ness and hatred were manifested against us in  almost every public quarter, Colonel Trumbo came to Utah, and showed interest in our affairs. Some of his own relatives were involved in cases  that were then before the courts. One promi- nent connection of his was consigned to the pen- itentiary, on the common charge that was in  vogue against so many prominent Latter-Day  Saints. The colonel's sympathies, it seems, were aroused, at least in behalf of his kinsfolk. This caused him to take interest in the whole  question; and this interest absorbed him to such  an extent that he withdrew from profitable busi- mess that he had at the time in San Francisco,  and devoted himself almost exclusively to the  labor of correcting the false impressions which  prevailed and to the enlistment of the press in  the correction of many falsehoods and asper- tions which were in circulation; and afterwards, on a wider field, using his influence with leading  men of the nation. We may say here that Colo- nel Isaac Trumbo is a man of extraordinary ener- gy. When he undertakes anything that he  thinks ought to be done, he is untiring in his ef- forts to accomplish it. These characteristics  were wonderfully illustrated in the labors which  he took upon himself in behalf of the maligned and misreprhsented Latter-Day Saints. Being a  man of means, HE WAS ABLE to travel from place  to place, and especially to visit and SUSTAIN HIM SELF at Washington. We can never forget his  activity in visiting editors and using his influence  to correct public opinion through the press. No  man could have dislayed greater zeal and disin- terestedness than he did in the labors that he  took upon himself. We felt that he was inspired;  for, not being a member of our religious organi- zation, and HAVING NO FINANCIAL ENDS TO ACCOM- PLISH that would be remunerative to him, there  was nothing to incite him to these extraordinary  exertions except a purely philanthropic desire to  defend an oppressed and unpopular people and  to roll back the tide of calumny and evil that  threatened to overwhelm them. We felt thank- ful many times for the kind Providence that  raised him up; for he seemed to come to our aid  when a man in his position and with his indefa- tigable energy was especially needed.  When the Mormon people were threatened with disfranchisement, Col. Trumbo spent con- siderable time in Washington, exerting himself to the utmost of his ability to defeat that infam- ous measure. And while there were other  agencies also at work (for every one that had any  influence in the community realized how neces- sary it was that this measure should be defeated), still Colonel Isaac Trumbo was the means of  bringing powerful influences to bear against the  enactment of that villainous bill. In the defeat of the proposed legislation every member of our  Church had cause to be deeply grateful to the  Lord and to the instruments which, under Him, were the means of bringing it to naught.  With the same zeal and devotedness he  worked untiringly to obtain the amnesty; and  also afterwards in securing the return of the per- sonal property to the Church, and in preparing  the way for the return of the real estate.  He threw himself into the accomplishment of  all these ends with an energy and wholeness of  soul that won him many friends and crowned his labors and the labors of those who worked with  with success.  Colonel Trumbo was most fortunate in win- ning the respect and admiration of influential men in the nation. By his representations of the  condition of things in the then Territory of Utah  and his enthusiastic defense of the Mormon  people, he aroused the active interest and sympa- thies of very many of them. This was notably  the case with General James S. Clarkson. This  gentleman was deeply moved by all that he learned, and he entered with his whole soul and  great influence, with Colonel Trumbo, into the  effort to make the true character of the people known to the nation and to remove the wide- spread and deeprooted prejudices which existed so generally at that time against the Mormon  people. It would be invidious perhaps to at- tempt to give names of other leading and influen- tial public men who, by the powerful appeals which were made to them, were induced to ex- amine what was known as the Mormon question  from a different standpoint to that which they  had occupied; but their names are cherished in  grateful remembrance by the men of Utah, and  their deeds will be preserved in the history  of the people. All the influence which he had  gained by personal acquaintance Colonel Trumbo  used to make the people of Utah better known to  the nation at large, and towards preparing the  way for the admission of Utah as a State. It is  not necessary for us to go into details concerning his labors in this direction; it is sufficient to say  that probably no single agency contributed so  much to making Utah a State as the labors of  Colonel Isaac Trumbo and his immediate friends.

I feel Disposed to address a few lines to you to infoerm you that I have commenced my Summer work ie to attend a long list of Conferences which lie through the western middle and New England States. You probably may have seen the list of coferences which we publish in the Times and Seasons, but lest you might have missed of it I will make metion of it here. The following places the quoroum of the Twelve were Expecting to visit. Ottaway and Franklin, Michigan. London, State of New York. Scarborough and Farmington Aug 3th. Norwalk 24, 25, Connecticut) Washington City Sept 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Pittsburgh, andc. I Expect to attend those Conferences on most of them especially, Westfield Farmington and New Haven so you may Expect a visit from me the first of August I shall be thare on the 3 and 4th if the Lord will and probably some of the Twelve with me; I dont know what a chance their will be for a Conference in Farmington but I thought I would appoint one any how and pay you a visit of nothing more, for I do not intend at any time to go through New England without calling at my fathers house. We understand that the work is prospering well in the regions of New Haven so it will be necessary to hold a conference there, and we have approved an Elder to go to Hartford that will be capable of meeting any thing that that City can present. Perhaps the people in Farmington would like to come out to attend one of our Conferences and some good might be done. I should be pleased to have Uncle Ozem Woodruff to be there and as many of his family as feel disposed Aunt Betsey, Bulah andc if they are alive and able and all who have any friendly feelings. I have not heard from Aunt Cossetts family since I herd from Betsey By letter which gave a distressing accoung of her mother. I have often remembered her in my prayers but know not how she is Neither have I herd any thing from Eunice since they wrote me that they were coming west I suppose they have gone but know not I moved my family into the new house the day before I left. I got two rooms done off and the rest of the house is not finished for I ENDENTRY Could not get seasoned lumber, but they can go into the house we mooved out of untill he can lay a floor in a room in the new House and then they will comfortable. I left my family well and in good spirits, my life and lot seems to be mostly in the vineyard I left G. A. Smith one of the Twelve, to attend the Conferences. I expect to meet with Elders O Hyde, L. Wight are in the City of Washington with petitions to Congress and preaching the gospel, we all have a general Conference there of about a week in month of Sept. It has been a vary wet spring in this western country, we have traveled most of our time since we left home in the raine mud and water. We have held meetings in all the large towns and villages on our route and delivered both religious and political lectures and prejudice is giving way like a flood all through the Country. we have held our Conferences thus far and had a good time. I am now in the midst of the Comstock Branch of about 50 members and surrounded by about 40 Elders from Nauvoo and other parts as good spirits as ever breathed ready to open a conference in a few minutes. Perhaps some of our friends abroad think strange that we are engaged in political matters and running a candidate for the presidency, but when they hear our reasons for thus doing they will see we are fully justified. Our polittical lectures have done much good in Breaking down Prejudice in fine the whole western world is open to investigate our principle, and the kingdom is rolling on. I expect if Br Webster and Eunice is gone you are some lonesome, so if I pay you a visit now it may fill up the vaccum of their abscence for a day or towo. I feel anxious to see you again, But I must lay down my pen and go to conference.  June 3rd. Monday We have had a good time for two days past. we have had an interesting Conference, their being 36 Elders present including the Twelve, High Council, High Priests, and Elders, the work is progressing rapidly on Every land. We had an interesting conference at Nauvoo {shorthand} the 6th of April Before I left, the most interesting probably the Church ever held. About twenty thousand persons were present and it was judged their was three thousand Elders present, many Clergymen of different Denominations attended. President Smith preach a great Sermon upon death, resurrection and Eternal Judgement, which presented great and glorious ideas to the mind of man. many Embraced the work on that occasion. ENDENTRY I should be pleased to meet all our friends or relations at your house that have faith in the work, but if I see no more it will be a consolation to meet my father and Mother, the longer I live, the more advanced you are in life the more I essteem it a  favor to look upon your faces, and when I contemplate the thought that you are like Old father Jacob not ownly bereaved of one Son but of evry Son and Daughter and left alone to pass away your feeling declineing hours in silence with not a child to see or know your cares, it at times causes me sorrow, but then again that sorrow is checked with a certain knowledge that it is my priviledge to meet with you in the first ressurection and enjoy a mansion in the Celestial Kingdom of God with my father and Mother and Brother and as far as I have any influence with the kingdom of God, it shall be used to accomplished this purpose, the more I understand as touching Eternal things the ^more^ interested I feel in the welfare of my kindred, I have quite a desire of late to feel atfeafter. Br Thompson I trust before they die to see thempage torn in the covepage tornant. I know the more a man understandspage torn the gospel, the Keys and Kingdom and Eternal things the more his hepage torn will be sealed to his Parents and his Children, this was the spirit that characterized all the prophets and patriarchs from Abel to Zachariah; I would like to spend more of my life in your company, but I am not ownly sacrificing the socity of my parents but my wife and Children for the great work of this dispensation. I have not herd from Br Azmon I that since he wrote you while I was East I intend to write him a letter as soon as I get time. If Dwight and Eunice is with you my respects to them of course. I feel anxious to learn about them, if you can have an opportunity of giving notice to Sister Farmington Conferece, I dont know how her Mother is, or how she will be situated, give my Respects to Sister Hooker and Jennett and all the Saints or friends who inquire after me, I dont know but your will be troubled to read my writing, for I have written in great heaste and surrounded by many many.

The days of doubting and experiment in the ^Sorghum^ Sugar Industry are gone by and are superseded by actual knowledge and an output which places the business as one of the most impor- tant and for some years to come the most profit- able of all home industries.  Seeing the fruition of my hopes and experiences in the success of the Fort Scott Factory and wishing to know of a surety with regard to the truth of the Statements made, I took my son Horace with me and visited the works at Fort Scott; We saw, during three days we remained there, for ourselves the actual demonstration of the successful man- ufacture of Sugar from the Sorghum Cane by ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Utah:  Oct 12th 1887.  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother:  I am happy and thankful to be able, after seven years of effort, to place before this people a valuable industry, the success and profit of which, like its value, are at last placed beyond doubt or peradventure.  You are doubtless aware that I have been struggling to solve the problem of the profitable manufacture of Sugar in this Territory, and that in consequence of the rapid and  constant decline in the price of that article, success so far as profit was concerned, has eluded my grasp; but my confidence in the ultimate issue has not been misplaced, and I am now in possession of the principle which doubles the output and lifts the industry from a doubtful position  to one of certain and undeniable success and profit.  Whereas in the past I have been able to make only Fifty pounds of sugar to the ton of cane, (a point just below the altitude of profit) I am now in a position to make from (100) one hundred to (135) One hundred ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Utah, August 22, 1887.  President Wilford Woodruff and Brethren of the Twelve:  Dear Brethren;  I am constrained to address you and ask your sanction and approval to my opening up and publishing a Paper dedicated to the interests of Producers generally,  but especially the Farmers. During the past few years, I have given much attention to the interests of Agriculture, and I have long been convinced of the utility, acccoun- ting to a necessity, of such a publication. My interest in behalf of the Producer aids me to see that there are not within the reach of the Farmers of this Territory the means of instruction and learning peculiar to their business that are ordinarily accessible to persons of their class in other States and Territories. There  being no local publication devoted to their interests exclusively they are at the mercy of foreign adven- turers, who palm off upon them cheap and com- paratively worthless publications which are gotten up ENDENTRY Diffusion. We saw the cane brought in on the farmer's wagons, weighed, conveyed into the Factory and watched it through all the processes and the sugar came forth ready for market.  We also verified the statement with regard to output by information from the Company's books showing how many tons of cane had been received up to date and the figures of the sugar realized we obtained from the book of the Kansas State agent who certifies to the amount entitlled to County of which the State pays 2¢ per lb. Comparison of these two amounts shows a little more than 100 lbs of sugar to the ton of cane; the sugar averaging from 92 to 98% sweet.  The business in Utah covers an annual outlay  of about one and a quarter millions of dollars and will pay a profit of from 20 to 40% on the capital invested. For the Servants of God to control a business of this magnitude is surely an object of interest so long as we are not fed with manna from heaven but have to supply our temporal wants by the use of the elements placed under our control and ENDENTRY so long as it is expected that "the Church shall  stand independent of every creature beneath the celestial world"  Our friends on the outside are ready to grasp this thing unless it is taken up by this people.  I have been solicited to write on this subject, since my return, for publication but have withheld from doing so awaiting an interview with you.  If it be altogether impracticable to accord me an interview, would you like to appoint a Committee of one or more, say Bro James Jack and Bro Clawson to investigate my statements and report to you  Very earnestly and respectfully submitted Your Brother in the Gospel Arthur Stayner ENDENTRY and thirty five lbs to the ton.  This advance isn output is due, primarily, to the principle of diffusion as a means of extracting the saccharine from Sugar producing plants, and next, to certain patented processes which I have the control of in this Territory.  I now earnestly crave the privilege of an interview at your early convenience, that I may lay before you some matters pertaining to this vast and valuable industry.  Very respectfully  Your Brother in the Gospel  Arthur Stayner ENDENTRY on purpose to carry the advertisements of Quack Doctors and "bogue Jewelry" Manufacturers, and which have been in- dustriously circulated amongst the Farmers and others of this Territory; the chief attractions of these papers being their low cost, a few items of information called from good publications, and one or two "blood and thunder" stories of the lowest and cheapest style.  I think that a paper devoted to the interests of our Farmers Manufacturers, Stock, Sheep and wool raisers, calling forth  correspondence upon practical matters locally important, and giving in a concise and condensed form the  best and most appropriate ideas from foreign journals, and bringing before our producing population some easy grades of scientific information for their develop- ment, and paving the way for an Agricultural and Mechanical Institution in the near future, would certainly be much more desirable than the trashy and in many instances improper literature ^from abroad^ to which the people are now sedulously invited to  subscribe. The lack of such a paper as I propose to establish is so manifestly felt that, doubtless,  ENDENTRY Arthur Stainer Oct 12th 1887 Answd Oct 13 1887 Stayner ENDENTRY if the want be not supplied from some controllable source within a short time, it will be supplied by some such party  as the Chamber of Commerce or some other party having money making solely, and not the true interests of the people, at heart.  It is the furthest thing from my wishes to Endeavor to work up or Encourage a Boom here; I have not got the same desire as the Chamber of Commerce in inducing foreigners to come here to locate, my interest is solely and entirely to benefit those of our faith who are here because of their faith, and many of whom not finding here the trade or work to which they had been apprenticed, and with which alone they were familiar, have been  forced into the ranks of the Farmers, unskilful and ignorant of the secrets of the soil; to such, a little palpable reasonable, plain instruction given in the spirit of a  wellwisher would assuredly be a help. And to  all, some hints and instructions in advance of their present information would be invaluable, leading them along from one improvement to another in the skilful manipulation of the Elements of nature, would ENDENTRY in a short time manifest a marked improvement in those important interests, Agriculture, Stock and Wool raising and Manufactures.  Through a source of this kind, statistical information regarding the quantity and kinds of produce raised could be collated and disseminated to the profit of producers, who,  if well posted, would frequently bend their energies in a direction which would supply a demand unprovided  for instead of adding to an already plethoric supply of some common article sold, because of its quantity, below the cost of production. It seems to me to be very palpably evident that branches of industry soin which  the people of the Territory are so largely interested should be and are worthy of the publication of a paper devoted principally if not exclusively to their interests.  I therefore propose, if I can meet with your approval, to publish such a paper, monthly to commence with, at the nominal cost of $1.50 a year, having been in- formed and feeling assured that the people will warm- ly welcome such a paper and support it liberally. And in return for patronage I will devote an un- ENDENTRY deviating and sincere interest to the paeople's true tem- poral welfare, and by careful research and prudent study place before them such instructions, hints and  suggestions as shall make a marked improvement in the results of their labours.
