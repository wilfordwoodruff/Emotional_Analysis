 66 THE DESERET NEWS.    DISCOURSE  By Elder Wilford Woodruff, delivered   in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sun-  day morning, Feb. 10, 1867.    It seems to have fallen to my lot this  morning to occupy a little time with the   brethren and sisters.  I desire that I   may have the attention of the people,  also a good degree of the Spirit of the   Lord, for I have lived long enough, and   have had experience enough in this   Church to know that I cannot edify any-  body by talking to them unless I do   enjoy the Holy Spirit.  In the first   place, I do not know what to say to the   people only as that spirit may direct   me; and I am dependent upon it, not   only in this duty, but in all the duties   of life, both temporal and spiritual.    I rejoice in the goodness and mercy of   God, and in the principles of the gospel   of life and salvation that He has revealed   in our day and generation for our exal-  tation and His glory.  I feel that of all   people under the heavens we have the   greatest reason to rejoice, be thankful,   faithful, prayerful and humble before   the Lord our God.  The Lord has seen  fit to organize the kingdom and put it   into our hands to build up.  He has   committed to us the plan of salvation,   and has given us the holy priesthood,   revelation and an organization--even the   Government of God, whereby we can   go to work here on the earth and mag-  nify our callings, fulfil the object of our   creation and receive ordinances and   blessings which will give us exaltation   and glory in the presence of God and   the Lamb.  This is as much as He has   ever done for any people that ever dwelt   upon the fact of the earth; it is as much   as any of our fathers ever possessed.    And while I look around me, and re-  flect upon the present state of the na-  tions of the earth, I feel as though it be-  comes us as a people to arm ourselves   with the power of God and every gift,   advantage, privilege and blessing with-  in our reach, that we may be prepared  for the great day of Almighty God, and   the great events that await us and this   generation; for more interesting events   never did take place in any period of   the world's history than will transpire   in this--the last dispensation of the   fulness of times.  It is true that the   speed with which the Lord will propel  or hasten the events of the last days will   depend to some extent upon our union,   obedience, good works and faithfulness   in keeping His commandments; but on   the other hand the actual fulfilment of   God's purposes with regard to this gen-  eration does not depend upon us, but  our blessings, and the blessings of all   men, depend on their course of con-  duct.    The Lord has shed His blood for the   redemption of all men out of every na-  tion under heaven; but He will deal   with all according to the deeds done in   the body, and He has commenced a con-  troversy with the present generation in   all nations which will never cease until   the consumption decreed on the face of  the earth is perfected and has its fulfil-  ment.  The fact that the Lord will re-  ward all men, nations, people and gen-  erations according to the deeds done in   the body was manifest in the days of   Israel; for after leading Israel forty   years in the wilderness, when they were  about entering the promised land, Moses  went and plead with the Lord to give   him the privilege to go over into Canaan.    But the Lord told Moses he could not   go, and he gave His reasons why; in   fact, He would not permit anybody to   go, who came out of Egypt, over twenty  years of age, except Caleb and Joshua.    They had kept the commandments of   God, fulfilled His will and manifested   their faith in Him all the time, hence   those two men were permitted to go   over with the generation born in the   wilderness, or at least with that portion  of them not over twenty years of age. [##Numbers 13##]    The Lord said, I am going to give this   people the land of Canaan that I pro-  mised their fathers, and I am going to  destroy those nations now inhabiting it;   but I want you, Israel, to understand   that  I am not going to do so because of   your righteousness, for you have been   rebellious forty years in the wilderness,  and I have been angry with, and should   have cut you off many times had it not   been for the pleading of Moses; but I   am going to cut off these nations be-  cause their cup of iniquity is full, be-  cause they have sinned unto death and   are ripe for the damnation of hell; and   I will give the land of Canaan to the   children of Israel, the seed of Abraham,   not that they are very good themselves,   but I have labored with them, they   have my ordinances and blessings, and   they are the best people I have.  -[See   ##Deuteronomy 9|Deuteronomy chap. 9.##]-    I have faith in God and in the revela-  tions of Jesus Christ given in these last   days, and in the stick of Joseph and in the  stick of Judah, which are the Bible and   the Book of Mormon, and as I look for-  ward to their fulfilment on the earth, I   will say that it pains my heart and feel-  ings when I reflect on the history of the   present generation. [##Ezekiel 37:16##] I do not believe   that God ever saw a more wicked gen-  eration than the one in which we live;  I do not believe that any of those cities  or nations, namely, Sodom and Gomor-  rah, the Canaanites, Hivites, Hittites,   or Perisites ever were as guilty, or com-  mitted more crime than the Christian   world to-day.  They are given over to   all manner of wickedness; the whole   earth groans in pain under the abomi-  nations that reign on the face thereof.    Look at our own good Christian coun-  try -- the United States, at Europe, and   all the world.  Where can any man be-  hold the semblance of righteousness or   righteous works?  What is the seed that   is sown?  What is the conduct of men?    All the editors of papers in all countries,   and the priests in every pulpit, wicked   as they are themselves, are crying out   against it; and they are ashamed of the  abominations that continually rise be-  fore them day and night.  Whenever a   people, nation, generation or govern-  ment forsakes virtue and departs from   righteousness, becomes corrupt and pro-  motes evil, and this principle is mani-  fest from centre to circumference, it   brings on its own head dissolution, de-  struction and ruin, because the Lord   will deal with all according to their   deeds.    There is no man who traveled in the   United States, England, and among the   nations abroad thirty or thirty-four   years ago, and who has traveled in those  nations of late years, but who is aston-  ished at the change which is manifest.    Right here in our own government, in   every department thereof, from head to  foot, and not only there, but it is so in   almost all situations under heaven; the   majority of men neither acknowledge   God nor regard man, but every man is  for gratifying his own passions and car-  rying out his own desires; even should   it involve the sacrifice of the rights of   millions of the human family, it mat-  ters not.    The inhabitants of the earth, general-  ly, acknowledge not the hand of God in   anything, and they are making a con-  tinued effort to uproot the only people   who do acknowledge His hand and who   are trying to build up his Kingdom.    While I look over the earth and see the   people thus destitute of the Spirit of   God, committing the works of darkness,   enduring the buffetings of satan, and   with the judgments of God right at   their doors, I feel, brethren and sisters,   that we, as Latter-day Saints should   watch unto prayer and live continually   before the Lord in such a manner that   we may understand the signs of the   times; every one of us should labor as   though it were the last day of our lives,  that we may obtain and enjoy what-  ever privileges and blessings the Lord  has placed within our reach.  We should   be united together that our righteous-  ness, prayers and good works may come   up before the Lord.  I believe in good   works.  If a man does not that which is  good he does that which is evil;   if he keeps not the commandments   of God he breaks them, and will   be punished with the loss of salvation   and exaltation in the presence of God.    But if a man will be baptised for the re-  mission of his sins and have hands laid   on him for the Holy Ghost, and will   keep God's commandments, receive his   endowments, his patriarchal blessing   and the holy priesthood, and continues   faithful before the Lord, he magnifies   his calling.  That is what the Lord   sent him for, and that is what we are all  sent for; to keep our estate by observing   the law of God and acting up  to the   light that God has revealed to us.    I am aware and satisfied that no man   can be saved only as he keeps the com-  mandments of God.  It is true the blood   of Jesus cleanses from all sin; the Lord   has shed His blood, and laid down His  life for the redemption of the human   family; but notwithstanding this we   never shall obtain salvation and exalt-  ation in the presence of God unless we   obey the gospel and those laws and   commandments that the Lord reveals.    I rejoice that there are a few people,   and that I have the privilege of being   associated with them, who have em-  braced the gospel of Christ.  We need   not marvel nor feel surprised at the   feelings of the nations around us, or that   the present generation should oppose  us, and go to a very great length in  their operations, even in a governmental   capacity, to try and overthrow the church  and kingdom of God.  They do not like   this kingdom; they do not understand   what right the Lord has to establish a  kingdom in the last days; they do not   believe that the earth is the Lords, and   the fulness thereof; they do not believe   that the cattle on a thousand hills are   His.  They do not believe that heaven   is His Throne, and that the earth is His   footstool; and although he has left his   record and testimony which have been   before the Christian world for genera-  tions, that he will raise a righteous peo-  ple, and will establish a kingdom and   will come and reign on the earth, yet   they do not believe these things.  But   we who have looked forward to this for   years past are right in the midst of this   work, and to build up this kingdom is   certainly a most interesting labor, and   one in which I rejoice, and I want to   live in that way and manner that I may  have the Spirit of the Lord to guide,   direct and assist me in whatever duties   I may have to perform.    I have no fears with regard to what  this generation may do, or attempt to   do, for I know that if we will do our   duty we shall be saved.  One thing is   certain, if the Lord deals with all men   according to the deeds done in the body,   the seed now being sown in the world   will bring death, misery, destruction and  sorrow upon the heads of the nations of   the earth.  The Lord is going to visit   this generation, and His judgments will   be severe, and they who undertake to   overthrow the church and kingdom of  God, fight against Him and His work;   will find they will not make headway,  for the Lord has decreed that He would   establish His work in the last days, and   His word will certainly be fulfilled.  I   will say that destruction awaits this  generation, the heavens are full of judg-  ments, and the angels of God with the  slaughtering weapons in their hands, are   waiting in His presence in the Temple in   heaven, as the prophet saw by vision, to   go and reap down the earth. The prophet  Ezekiel had a view of this on one oc-  casion when the Lord told him that  those men with the destroying weapons  were commanded to go and reap down  the earth; one of their number had a   writer's inkhorn, and he was command-  ed to set a mark on those who sighed   and cried over the abominations com-  mitted on the earth.  And the angel   went forth and set a mark on those who  kept the commandments of God; the   rest followed, and slew every man ex-  cept those who were thus marked.  They   began at the sanctuary, and it was in   the last days; [##Ezekiel 9##] and judgments surely   await this generation because their   wicked acts bring judgment on them-  selves, but with the Latter-day Saints   everything depends on their faithfulness   before the Lord.    I have a desire to see this people faith-  ful.  The Lord has stayed His hand in  judgment until this gospel could be   preached to all nations, before the end   came; and years ago, He told the Latter-  day Saints to go forth, in faith and   without fear, and bear testimony of the  things of the kingdom of God.  "And,"   said He, "they who reject you and your   testimony of me, I will curse and des-  troy; for my judgments shall follow;   with thunder, lightnings, tempests,   storms, fire, sword and plague will I   plead with all flesh and the slain of the   Lord  shall be many." [##Luke 10:16##]  The Lord has   commenced His work and His promised   judgments are in process of fulfilment.    We could not build up this kingdom,   make it spread, and build up Zion if the   Lord did not work for us; the powers of   darkness and evil that are so universal   would uproot and destroy the kingdom   of God from the face of the earth if the   Lord Almighty did not defend it and   cut of[f] the bitter branches; it would be  in the same position as the city of Enoch,  and as Christ and his Apostles, and as   the prophets in many dispensations   were; there would be no room for it   but it and every righteous principle   would be overpowered by the powers   of darkness and death.  We, however,   have the promise of the Lord that He   has set His hand for the last time to es-  tablish His kingdom, and that He will   fight for Mount Zion, and will utterly   cut off those who fight against it.  Then   we need not trouble ourselves about   what our enemies may do, whether they  are here in Utah, at Washington or in   any other part of the world.  We need   not trouble ourselves about this, our

 of being thrown out of his place.  As I look at it now and I am sure  I am right the reorganization has  indulged so extremely in finding  fault with the people of Utah (who are  really our brethren) as to cause  malice and unkindness (perhaps  only with themselves) perhaps with   both bodyies (I know not) for I have  not been with the Utah people to  hear for myself and can not judge  from hearsay. But as it would  be right for Bro. Joseph to stand  at the head of the whole  church instead of only part, it  would be possible (while that can  be gradually brought about) for  us by a united effort to establish  the poor in Zion and thus reach  a complete unity in the near future.  It shall be my constant effort

The earth is the  Lords footstool for the rearing up of ^tabernacling of his children or^ those  spirits that belong to him in the eternal  worlds, for his children to dwell upon,  that they might receive laws celestial,  ^and^ telestial, and terrestial. This was the  object of the creation of the earth, and  the devil had no power ^right^ to offer it,  for he does not own it.    The Lord ordained this dispensation  before the world was.

 to impress upon the different faction  the fact that they must recognize  the authority of the rest in asmuch  as they have been baptized by one hav-  ing authority. For every one who  has been baptized by one having   authority belong to the church  of God notwithstanding the fact  that ^some^ may have gone astray  in some things. For it cannot  be possible for the authority to be  taken from a church until they  sin against the Holy Ghost.  To my mind the quotation from   the D and C which our people  quote to show that the church  now there lost their authority,  namely  "the church shall be  rejected with her baptisms for the   dedad" only shows a suspension  of the work of establishing Zion  and the baptisms for the dead. 
 DISCOURSE  BY  ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  In the 15th Ward Meeting House  on Sunday Evening, June  13th, 1880.  ______  REPORTED BY GEO. F. GIBBS.  ---------  I HAVE spent but very little time in  Salt Lake City on the Sabbath day  since my return from the south; Sat-  urdays and Sundays I have generally   spent the time attending our Quar-  terly Conferences abroad. I have  felt as though I would like to visit   the people in a ward capacity as far   as I have opportunity, and I thought   I would call down and visit our   friends of the 15th Ward this eve-  ning.    I have been very much edified in   listening to Bro. Morgan, and I con-  sider he has a correct idea of the   state of our country, and also with   regard to the events that await us,  as a people, and also this generation.  Part of Bro. Morgan's remarks re-  mind me of my first mission, espe-  cially that part describing the man-  ner in which the missionaries in the   Southern States travel. The ground  that Bro. Morgan has been traveling   over, I traversed through the winter   of 1834-5 and the year following;  and I could not help contrasting, in  my own mind, while listening to   him, the manner in which he and   his brethren travel, with the man-  ner in which I and others traveled  in the early days. You who have   read the Doctrine and Covenants  understand that some of the revela-  tions therein contained were given  unto us at that time. The first mis-  sionary labor I performed in this   Church was done by commandment,  without purse or scrip. My first   mission after I went up to Zion's   Camp was through the Southern  States. I called upon Bishop Par-  tridge, who was our first Bishop,   who was then in Missouri, Clay  County. He said he wished some  of the elders to go into the Southern  Country. I asked him a few ques-  tions, some of which were these:  "Where do you want me to go?" He  said, "I would like you to go through   Missouri into Arkansas." Said I,  "Jackson County lies directly in our   road, is it your advice that we go   through Jackson County?" He re-  plied that he had not faith enough   himself to travel through Jackson   County; but that if we had we   might do so. You, perhaps, will re-  member that we had just been driv-  en out from there, and it was as   much as a Mormon's life was worth   to be seen in Jackson County. I   said to him: "Bishop Partridge, shall  we go without purse or scrip?" He  said, "I have not got faith enough to   do it myself, if you have you can   try it." I was a boy, and I must   say—not that I have any fault to   find with Bishop Partridge, for he   was a good man—that he did not  encourage us much. We had the   commandment of God on this point,  to go without purse or scrip, on the   one side, and the Bishop's advice on   the other. I said I would not take   purse or scrip, because the law of   God forbid it. I and my companion  started out. In going through Jack-  son County we dared not call upon  anybody, and being hungry, we went  into a corn-field and took the ears of   corn and eat the corn like horses,  without grinding, though some of it   we pounded. We continued our   way South, and having no money,  after leaving Jackson County we  begged our bread from door to door;  and when we asked for something   we always received it, and we were   never turned out of doors. I refer  to these things because they come  to my mind, and cannot help con-  trasting in my own mind how differ-  ent things were forty five years ago   from what they are to-day. Brother   Morgan has been telling us how they   travel in the South, and I can bear   testimony to what he has said, that  when a man goes forth trusting in   God he gets along fully as well, feels  better, and generally has as good  success as the man who goes into   the missionary field with his pock-  ets full of money.    I traveled through Arkansas, and  had quite an experience. I had  visions and dreams to warn me of   danger and to encourage me in my   labors. In one instance, a man  came towards me, intending to kill  me; the circumstances was shown  me in a vision the night before. A  mob of thirty men was raised, and   they swore they would ride us on a   rail, and tar and feather us, and  then hang us. My companion was  in favor of leaving the country; but  I told him I was going to stay there  at the risk of my life. When the   mob approached us, the leader came  forward with the intention of killing  me; the consequence was precisely   as had been shown me in my vision  —when he got to where I was he   fell dead at my feet; and it was not   more than ten days when twenty of   this mob took sick and died—all   done by the same power and by the   destroying angel who is both power-  ful to save or destroy. We remained  there until we saw the literal fulfil-  ment of what had been shown me  in the night vision. I held the office   of a priest, while my companion was  an elder, and you know how a person   would feel in those days if he rebelled   against a man over him in the priest-  hood. I did so, and it was the only   time in my life that I ever attempted  to do such a thing. When my part-  ner told me he was going to leave, I   told him that he should not do so,  neither would I; and I persisted in   holding him there for two weeks.  During this time we witnessed the   hand of the Lord in preserving our   lives and in slaying our enemies,  and now was the time for us to go   to work, but which we did not do;   in that we did wrong, for after re-  maining there two weeks, my com-  panion said he would not stop any   longer, and I dared not stay there   alone, and therefore we left. If we   had remained, after the door had  been thus opened, I have not a doubt  but what we would have raised up   quite a large branch of the Church.  But my companion did not wish to   stop longer, the only ordinance he   administered during this mission   was to baptize a man and woman  who received us, Father and Mother  Hibber, who believed in the divinity   of the Book of Mormon. The man   who was struck dead at my feet was   Mr. Akeman, who lived in Jackson   County, Mo., during the persecu-  tions, and buried is wife there.  He had several sons six feet high.   The old gentleman passed through  much, and then apostatized and   went to Arkansas and settled there.  It would have been better for him to   have kept the faith, for he did not   live long after he got there, and I do   not think he got much glory either.  After our two weeks' experience in   this place the whole neighborhood  seemed ready to receive the gospel,   and if I had stopped there, I am  satisfied that I could have built up   quite a church. It is true, being a   priest, I could not have confirmed  believers after baptizing them for   the remission of their sins, but I   could have baptized them and ad-  ministered the sacrament.    Leaving this place, and having no   money to travel, we went to Arkan-  sas River, and there dug out a canoe  from the trunk of a cottonwood tree,  and paddled ourselves a distance of   one hundred and twenty-five miles  down the river. The first day we  made about forty miles, and stopped  over night with a poor woman who   lived in a log cabin without a floor.  She gave us supper and breakfast,  and also a piece of johnny-cake and   pork, which we took along. That  day we went down to the Darda-  nelles, and stopped over night in a   big tavern, which was unoccupied.  There was not a man within twenty   miles, and when we inquired what  was the matter, we were told the   place was haunted. We tied up our  canoe, took our lunch, asked a bless-  ing on it and ate it. After dark we  went to bed, and I slept soundly, on  one of the best of feather beds, (in a   dream,) at my father's house, and it   is hardly necessary for me to say   nobody haunted us or disturbed our  slumber in the least.    After a good night's rest we went  on to Little Rock and tied up our  canoe. After visiting hero, we went  on to where a man named Jones  lived, where we left our canoe, and   preached the next day. We then  walked back to Little Rock, and tak-  ing the old military road, started to   cross the Mississippi swamp, which   was, the most part of it, covered  with water from the place we started  to Memphis, Tennesee—a distance   of about one hundred and eighty  miles. We had to wade through   mud and water sometimes knee  deep, which had the effect of giving  me an attack of rheumatism, which   crippled me. My companion was in   good health and wanted to hurry on,  so we parted; he left me resting on   a log. I was now alone, lame and   without food, in a swamp, some  thirty-five miles from the nearest  house. In considering the situation,  and being all covered with mud, I   could not help laughing at my con-  dition—my companion leaving me  sitting on a log in a swamp, thirty-  five miles from any house, without   food. I did not see my companion  again for two years. But, withal,   I knew I needed assistance, so when   my companion had gone out of sight   I knelt down in the water and prayed  fervently to the Lord to heal me, so   that I could continue my journey.  I felt the operation of the Holy Spirit  upon me; I arose from my knees, the   pain having left me. I then went   on, bearing testimony to a family   here and there wherever opportu-  nity presented itself. When I came   to Memphis I was there without any   money. I went to the best tavern  in the city, which was kept by a Mr.  Jackson. I told him of my financial  condition, and asked him if he would  keep me over night. Said he, scan-  ning me from head to foot, "What   is your calling?" I said, "I am a   preacher of the gospel."  He looked  at me again and burst out laughing,  and then said: "You look like one."  -[Laughter.]- I could not take any   exceptions, because the ministers of  the various denominations, in travel-  ing over the country, were furnished   with a good saddle horse, they al-  ways had money and wore good  clothes. And the idea of a man  who had waded through mud and  water, and partly crippled through   rheumatism, claiming to be a   preacher, I could not blame him for   laughing at me; in fact, I could not  help laughing myself. Mr. Jackson  rather suspected me; I believe he  thought I was one of Murvill's Clan  —a set of men who were stealing  negroes and killing men. He asked  me then: "How shall I know that   you are a preacher?" I put my hand  into my pocket, took out a paper and  presented it to him, telling him at  the same time that that was my  license. After reading it over, and  still keeping up his laughing spell,  he said: "But how shall I know that   this is a genuine certificate? Will   you preach?" "For mercy's sake,"  said I, "don't set me a preaching."  And it had the effect of making  him feel quite curious to hear me.  He took my valise out of my hand,  saying that I must preach. I was  invited into the house, and while I   was resting and waiting for supper,  Mr. Jackson sent all over town and  invited the "upper ten" to come and   hear a "Mormon" preach; and while  I was eating supper they came,  dressed in silks and satins and broad-  cloth, and before I got through the  house was full of people, who sat  looking at me, no doubt expecting to   be highly entertained. Supper over,   the landlord intimated to me that   they were ready to hear the preach-  ing. I told him I was ready to   preach to them. He then set me  in a corner, where I was guarded by   about a dozen men, who would have   prevented me from jumping out of  the window, in case I had made the   the attempt to do so. I had a Bible and  a hymn book. On opening the book,  I asked if some one would kindly   lead in singing, that I did not possess  the gift of singing. At this my   congregation burst out laughing.  When this subsided, I knelt down  and offered prayer, and then preached  to them for one hour and a quarter;   I had the best attention, the Spirit  of the Lord rested mightily upon   me, and I have always thought that  I preached that evening one of the   best sermons I ever preached in my   life. The people seemed to partake  of the spirit that rested on me, and   I think I revealed to them their pri-  vate life as clear as it was ever  shown to them; and I knew this,  because I could read them as they   sat before me. When I got through   I was left standing alone; and in a  short time the house was cleared,  and the landlady came and showed   me to bed. Where I slept was an  upper room next to a wholesale store;  and in the next room was a compa-  ny of men discussing the merits of   the sermon, and the partition being  of board, I could hear all that was  said. Among other things, I heard  one saying: "Jim, how in h—ll  did that stranger know what you   were about?" After talking consid-  erably they began to dispute among  themselves, when one of them said,  "Let us have the preacher up to de-  cide it."  "No," said the landlord,  "we have had enough of him for  one night." I went on to Middle  Tennessee and labored there one  year, and preached and baptized a   great many people before I was or-  dained an elder. I afterwards I was  ordained an elder by Warren Par-  rish, and a seventy by D. W. Patten.  I ordained Brother Smoot and Ben-  jamin Clapp as elders. All my travel-  ing was done without purse or scrip;   and God was with me, although a   young man, and revealed unto me  his mind and will.    And here let me say to our young   deacons, teachers and priests, I had  as much of the power of God with   me, and was blessed with as much   of his spirit, while I held the Aaronic  priesthood as when an apostle. I   had as much of his power to help  me to preach and to deliver me  from the grasp of my enemies as I   ever had since. I say this for the  encouragement of our young men   and our boys who are called to the   priesthood; and I would say to them,  fill your position, magnify your call-  ing in humility before God, and seek  after him in your youth, and also   seek to prepare yourselves for future  usefulness in the great work which   lies before you, and the Lord will  work through you, making you hon-  ored instruments in helping to bring  to pass his great and eternal pur-  poses with regard to the salvation of  mankind and the overthrow of wick-  edness in the earth.    While it occurs to me I will relate  one little circumstance which took  place after I had been out two years.  Elders David W. Patten and Warren  Parrish had been laboring together   in Tennessee. Elder Patten had re-  turned to Kirtland, leaving Brother   Parrish in charge of the branches of  the Church throughout the Southern  country. And while laboring under  Brother Parrish, and still holding  the Aaronic priesthood, I received a   letter from Joseph Smith and Oliver   Cowdery, informing me that they   wished Brother Parrish to come  home, and me to remain in charge  in his stead; and among other things,  Brother Joseph said to me, "I will  promise you, in the name of the   Lord, that by so doing you shall lose  no blessing that would otherwise be  conferred upon you." Just before  Bro. Parrish left he ordained me an  elder, and during that year after  Bro. Parish left I baptized some  thirty persons. When I received  the letter referred to from the   Prophet Joseph, I was in Brother  Smoot's house; he was there and  had read my letter. I remember  how well I felt at the promises that   had been made to me; and when   bedtime came I retired to the small  room which I occupied, shut the   door, and soon received a heavenly   vision. Here let me say with regard  to seeing visions; when Joseph Smith  received the visitation of Moroni,  Peter, James and John and others,  they came and talked with him as   one man talks with another, face to   face. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:30-47##] [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] In other cases men have been  wrapt in vision, as, for instance,  Paul, when describing his state, said  that he did not know whether he   was in the body or out of the body,  but he saw and heard things not to  be uttered. [##2 Corinthians 12:3##] And it was so with me;  I could not tell whether I was in the   body or out of the body; but one   thing I do know, I was not asleep.    I saw a great many things in that  vision which were truly wonderful.  I saw the resurrection of the dead;  I saw the sun turned to darkness,  and the moon to blood, and the stars  from heaven fall. I saw seven gold-  en lions sit in the heavens as burning  brass, and the angel told me that  they were representatives of the   different dispensations. These are  things I hardly ever talk about, and   I only do so now because it is in the   line of my remarks, and because  they come to my mind. If I had   been a painter, the next morning  when I awoke, or even to this day—  as the scene has a lasting remem-  brance on my mind—I could have  sat down and portrayed these glori-  ous things; they made a much  stronger impression on my mind  than if I had learned them from   books. I name this to show you,   my young brethren, that it makes  no difference what office a man  holds, or what his condition in life   may be, as long as he trusts in the   Lord and he magnifies the office he  holds, no matter what may be that  calling. This was the manner in  which we traveled in early days,   and we had joy in our labor, the   Lord blessing us with souls for our  hire. I traveled all over the coun-  try, comprising a circuit of some  three hundred or four hundred miles,  and labored there two years. I built  up a number of branches of the   Church, and among others I bap-  tized a Campbellite preacher and a  good many of his flock. When I   returned to Kirtland I took Brother  Smoot with me; I was there when  the endowments were given in the   winter of 1836-7, and received many   blessings at the hands of the Lord.    In this respect I certainly realized  the fulfilment of the promises made  me by the Prophet Joseph when I  was requested to remain in the   Southern country to take charge of  the branches of the Church in that  land.    I was in Kirtland at the time of   the great apostacy, which some of  you have read of in the history.   Men have asked me why men who  have borne the apostleship have  apostatized. I would ask, why do  men apostatize to-day? Because  they set their hearts upon the things  of this world, which in time alien-  ate them from God and from the   duties of the holy priesthood; and  this was the case with them. The   key to this matter may be had by   reading the letter written by the   Prophet Joseph when confined in   Liberty Jail; it plainly states why  men apostatize. Many are called,  but few are chosen. And why are  they not chosen? Because they set  their hearts too much upon the   things of this world, and aspire to  the honors of men. That was the   case with some of the first quorum  of the Twelve. I hold in my hand   a copy of the Book of Mormon, the   truthfulness and divinity of which   is attested to by the signatures of   eleven men, and yet there was not  one of these witnesses, excepting  the three Smiths and Hiram Page,   but what turned against Joseph.  They did not deny their testimony   to the truth of the Book of Mormon;  on the contrary, they maintained  their position in that respect to the   last moment of their life; but  they rebelled against and opposed the   Prophet Joseph, and consequently   they fell, and will be found under  condemnation. When men under-  take to use their priesthood aside  from its legitimate purposes—the  building up of the kingdom of God  —the Spirit of God is grieved, and the   heavens withdraw themselves,  and then "amen" to the priesthood  and authority of such men. It mat-  ters not who the man may be, or how  great his influence in the commu-  nity, he must sooner or later fall a   prey to the devourer of souls. And  on the other hand, when men hold-  ing this holy priesthood magnify it,   it becomes a power and a key in   them, and they have power before  God and the heavens.    I was in Kirtland during that dark  hour through which the Church   passed. Brother Joseph hardly knew  who his friends were when he met  them, whether they were members  of the quorum of the Twelve, high   priests, seventies, the witnesses to   the Book of Mormon, or any one  else. It was the darkest day this   Church has ever known, as far as  the power of apostacy is concened;  and I hope and trust it will never  again be repeated to the same extent,  although men may continue to   apostatize, when they forsake God  and his cause. And while things   were in this state, the Spirit of God   said to me, leave this place, go to   the islands of the sea and preach  the everlasting gospel, and let the   scenes in Kirtland take care of them-  selves. I had not taken counsel  with anybody, but I went to Brig-  ham Young and Brother Kimball  and stated to them my feelings.   Brothers Rigdon and Kimball said  go. And afterwards Brother Kim-  ball desired me to remain with him,  and help him turn his house around.  I stayed with him two days, and  then started off on my mission, the   results of which I have very briefly   alluded to.    I also traveled through Canada in   company with John Allen Hale and  Milton Holmes, whom I chose as   my associates. Bro. Hale was not  what was called a great preacher,  but was a good man, who could bear  testimony to the divinity of the   gospel we preach. I preached and   baptized some in Canada. Bro. John  E. Page was there at the time; he   was afterwards chosen a member of  the quorum of the Twelve, but was  among those who afterwards aposta-  tized. Traveling through Canada,  I went through Oswego, took the   canal and went to Connecticut to   my father's house. I had not seen  my parents from the time I em-  braced the goospel, a period of some  five years. Before starting out on my   mission, however, I went to see Fa-  ther Smith, the patriarch, who   blessed me and he gave me the  promise that I should be successful  in bringing my father's house into  the church. When I called upon   him I preached to him and baptized   him and my stepmother and my   uncle, Ozam Woodruff and wife and   son and my step-sister, together  with others who lived in my father's   house.    I then went to Fox Island, where  I organized a branch of the church.   When we landed there at midnight  we were entire strangers without a  single penny. The first house we   approached we found vacant; we  went on to the next, where we  were accommodated with a bed.  The next morning I said to the lady,  "Will you tell me if there is any re-  ligion on this island, and if so,  what?" She answered "the Bap-  tist religion." "Have you a church?"  "Yes, a Baptist church." "Have   you a minister?" "Yes, a Bap- 
 DISCOURSE  BY  ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  In the Salt Lake Assemby Hall,  Sunday Afternoon, December  12th, 1880.    REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.    WHEN we hear a young man get up  in our midst—twenty-six years of   age—and say that he was born and  reared in this city, it conveys to our  minds in a limited measure some-  thing of the length of time we have  dwelt here, something of the age of  our city. In fact, when I contem-  plate our position in thse moun-  tains, when I look back to the 24th  of July, 1847, when we as pioneers  came into this barren desert, the  time appears very short to me. We  had never lived anywhere until we  came into these mountains but a  very short time in a place; in fact,  quarter of the time that our brother  has lived here in this city since his  birth would limit us in our existence  in any city or town almost whenever  we have lived.    It is interesting to me as an indi-  vidual to listen to the testimonies of  our young elders who have been  born and reared in the land of Zion,  who never saw Babylon, nor the  world, until they were sent abroad  upon their missions. It is interest-  ing to me to reflect upon our position  and condition as a people here in the  mountains of Israel, in fulfilment  of the words of the Lord.    There has been a great deal said  by our enemies since the organiza-  tion of this church concerning Joseph  Smith; concerning the Book of Mor-  mon having been written by Spauld-  ing as a novel; and of this work be-  ing a deception. Yet, after all, it is  rather a wonder to the world that  an illiterate boy like Joseph Smith,  if he was not taught by the God of   Israel and by the spirit of revelation,  could possess the power to bring  forth such principles as are recorded  in the Book of Mormon and in the  Book of Doctrine and Covenants,  and to organize a system of govern-  ment, a system of religion, a system  of the church upon the face of the  earth, that was far beyond all the   combined power of the while Chris-  tian world. You may take all the  learned men of the earth, all the  doctors of divinity, with all the  knowledge that they possess, put  them all together, and they had not  the power to organize such a church   as has been organized by Joseph  Smith.    This should be some evidence, a  little evidence at least, to the world,  and to the unbeliever, that there is  something connected with Mormon-  ism that they do not comprehend  and understand. Let any man take  the Book of Mormon and read it  through from beginning to end—read  that history, read what the prophets  say upon the principle of faith, hope   and Charity, the administrations of  Jesus Christ upon this land, the or-  ganization of the Church, and the  miracles wrought here upon the land  of American—and let them ask them-  selves if they suppose that Solomon  Spaulding could sit down in a corner  and write a novel covering these  principles? No; they know better.  Any reflecting mind on earth knows  very well that the Book of Mormon  never orginated from a source of  that kind, any more than they can  accuse the Bible of having been  brought forth by the same cause. If  one orginiated from God, the other  did.    Again. Let any man read the  Book of Doctrine and Covenants; let  him read the revelations therein  given, and he will find the strongest  language, the most sublime language,  that God every revealed to man. There  is no language I ever read in any  record given to the human family,  that will compare with the sublimity  and power of these revelations given  through that boy, Joseph Smith.  Read the revelation called the "Olive  Leaf;" read any of the revelations  given in the early days of the pro-  phet, and you will find them full of  the power of God, full of eternal  principles. Read the prayer of Jo-  seph Smith in Liberty Jail, and the  answer of the Lord unto him; take  the very least of any of the revela-  tions recorded in that book, and see  if any man could go to work and get  up anything of the kind. Do they  sound anything like the compositions  of a man trying to write a novel?  No; they are the word of the Lord,  and the Spirit of God bears record of  the truths it contains.    We have every cause as the Saints  of the living God to exercise faith in  the revelations of heaven, and in the  fulfilment of his promises unto us  as Latter-day Saints. In fact, as  the Apostle James has said, "Faith,  if it hath not works, is dead, being   alone. Yea, a man may say, I have  faith, but do not believe in works:  shew me thy faith without thy  works, and I will shew thee my faith  by my works." The Saints of God  —and I believe myself all Gods and  all inteligent beings from eternity  to eternity—have all had to exercise  this principle of faith. "Faith is the  substance of things hoped for, the  evidence of things not seen." By  faith we understand the worlds were  made. God spake, chaos heard, and   the world came into order. I believe  that our Heavenly Father, and all  intelligent beings in the heavens  have to exercise faith in their labors  the same as the inhabitants of the  earth. I believe it is an eternal   principle, that has existed from eter-  nity to eternity, and will exist for-  ever, not only on earth with  mortal beings, but in the eternal  world of immortal beings. In the  Bible we have many examples of  what the ancient apostles and pro-  phets performed by faith. Noah,  being warned of God, went to work  and built an ark, but owing to the  wickedness and unbelief of the peo-  ple, only eight souls were saved  from the flood. The same principle  of faith exists with us. It has been  by faith that this assembly has been  brought here to-day. What would  have been our condition, if when  we heard the gospel in our own coun-  try, we had not exercised faith?  Why, would we have stayed in our  own country; Utah would have been  as barren as we found it in 1847.  Had there not been faith in the pro-  clamation of the gospel of Christ,  both with the preacher and with the  hearer; had there not been the Spirit  of God to back up the testimony of   the elders of Israel in their labors  abroad among the nations of the  earth, nobody would have gathered  here to these valleys of the moun-  tains. But it has been the work of  the Almighty. It is in accordance  with the decrees of God to establish  his kingdom upon the earth in the  latter days. Joseph Smith was  called by revelation. He labored in  faith. Angels of God taught him.  He received instructions from these  holy messengers; but notwithstand-  ing all this, he had to exercise faith  in the organization of the church, in  the calling of men to the ministry,  and in sending them forth to the nat-  tions of the earth—all these things  had to be performed by faith as  much as a man who plants grain.  The farmer sows his wheat, or any-  thing else, believing that it will  grow. If the elders had not believed  that God had called them, that the  Lord would sustain and uphold them,  they never would have gone abroad  upon their missions. But the prin-  ciple of faith has been exercised by  this people, and we must still con-  tinue to exercise it. The Lord is  with us. The Lord has set his hand  to build up his kingdom. He is  gathering a people from the nations  of the earth to Zion. He has set his  hand to establish it in its beauty,  power and strength, and I have be-  lieved, and believe still, that the   Lord will not disappoint us, nor will  he disappoint this generation; "but  a litte one will become a thousand,  and a small one a strong nation. I  the Lord, will hasten it in its time."    We should labor to exercise this  principle of faith in our lives. We  may look forward for the fulfilment  of all the prophecies and promises  which had been made since the   world began concerning this genera-  tion. There are many things which  have been reserved from the creation  of the world, to be revealed in the  last dispensation and fulness of  times. We have not got through  receiving revelation. The Lord has  a great many things to reveal in the  latter days, when we are prepared  as a people to receive them.    I rejoice in the progress of the  work of God. I rejoice in listening  to the testimonies of the elders of  Israel. A new generation has risen up  since we came to these valleys of  the mountains. The Lord has  raised up the sons and daughters of  prophets, apostles and elders and  fathers in Zion; and as I often re-  mark to our young men they have   got to round up their shoulders and  bear off this kingdom. The work  will not stop because men die. It  matters not who dies. When the  Prophet Joseph Smith was taken  away—I was going to say the saints  themselves felt as though all was  lost. The world supposed that  would be the end of Mormonisim.  It is true the death of Joseph Smith  caused mourning to rest upon all the  Latter-day Saints, but that did not  stop the work of God. Joseph Smith  lived until he obtained all the keys  of the kingdom of God which be-  longed to this generation, and sealed  them upon the heads of other men.  The Lord called him to the other  side of the vail to unlock the prison  doors; but his dying did not stop the  work of God. When President   Young was called away the world  had the same views. People had an  idea that when Brigham Young died  that would be the end of Mormon-  ism; that the apostles and leaders  would quarrel as to who should lead  the Church; that Mormonism would  all break up and go to the devil.  But they were entirely disappointed  in this. As I have already said, it  makes not difference who dies, wheth-  er it be Wilford Woodruff, Orson  Pratt, President John Taylor or any   one else, there will always be some-  body to lead the Church, Israle will  never be without a law-giver from  this time henceforth and forever.  Zion will continue to progress, and   the God of Israel will sustain her no  matter what the feelings of world  may be, not matter how much opposi-  tion there may be to the kingdom  of God. I should be sorry if the  world were of one heart and mind  with us. I would fear and tremble   if such were the case; for the Lord  has said, "I have chosen you out of the  world, therefore the world hateth  you. If they have persecuted me,  they will persecute you also." We  look upon perscution, then, as the  legacy that has been given to the  Saints of God in their day and genera-  tion. But there is one thing that I  think we should exercise faith in,  and that is in the perpetuity of this  Church and kingdom: and in the  destiny of the Latter-day Saints; in  the fulfilment of prophecy and re-  velation in regard to what God has  decreed upon the earth in this great   and last dispensation. We should  exercise faith in these things. If it  were not for this we should be in  the same condition as other genera-  tions have been. But as the Lord  lives there is no power on earth, or  under the earth, that has power, or  ever will have power, to stay the  progress of this Church and kingdom  or destroy it from off the earth be-  cause the God of heaven has decreed  it, and the little stone cut out of the  mountains without hands will roll  forth and fill the whole earth, no  matter what opposition is brought  to bear against it. No other dispen-  sations on earth have had this privi-  lege, and this has strengthened us, it  strengthened Joseph Smith, Brigham  Young, and the elders, of Israel.  Amond the first things Moroni in-  stilled into Joseph Smith before  he received the priesthood before the  organization of this was the prophe-  cies of Isaiah, and told him that the  day had come when the God of  heaven was about to set up his king-  dom on earth never more to be  thrown down. The lord had de-  creed that this should take place and  it must come to pass. Joseph Smith  believed the testimony of Moroni.   He believed the testimony of the  angel whom God had sent to admin-  ister to him. He taught those prin-  ciples to his brethren, and his breth-  ren believed them. The apostles in  their travels abroad, notwithstanding  the difficulties they had to overcome  upon their early missions, had these  principles continually before them.  We have them before us to-day; and  I know as God lives that the proph-  ecies will be fulfilled concerning the  establishment of the kingdom of God  in the latter-days. It was this king-  dom of our God that the Prophet  Isaiah, in looking down to our day  and generation, exclaimed, "Sing,  O heaven; and be joyful, O earth;  break forth into singing, O, ye moun-  tains: for the Lord hath comforted  his people, and will have mercy upon  his afflicted. But Zion said, The  Lord hath forsaken me, and my God  has forgotten me. Can a woman  forget her sucking child, that she  should not have compassion on the  son of her womb? Yea, they may for-  get, yet will I not forget thee."  Why? Because Zion has been before  the Lord from the creation of the  world, and the day has come to build  it up. The prophets saw it; they  believed in. We see it: we believe  it, for we have faith in God. We  should labor to build up this Zion dur-  ing the little time we dwell here. We  have been prospered, we are blessed;  and the Zion of our God is held in  the hands of the Almighty or we  would not have power to gather  here. Were it not that we are sus-  tained by Almighty God, we would  not have power to build these tem-  ples, to fill the mountains with cities  and towns and villages and gardens  and orchards, and raise crops and  flocks and herds as we have done.  These things are the gifts of God un-  to us, and it is all in the great pro-  gramme of the last dispensation, the  fulness of times.    But, says the world, what are you  going to do when a great nation like  the United States say you shall not  do these things, you shall not dwell  here and enjoy your religion? Well,  I will tell you what we are going to  do—we are going to trust in God,  that is what we are going to do, and  if this nation with its fifty millions   of inhabitants has more power than  God, then Zion will fail, the kingdom  of God will fall, and all the purposes  of the Almighty will come to an end.  It just hinges right there. The  Lord thus far has never failed in  his promises, it is the Lord and the  nation for it. I think the Lord holds  the most power. He holds the des-  tiny of this and every other nation  in his hands. I know he has made  certain promises in regard to this   land of Zion. He has fulfilled many  of these promises already. It is  upon this principle that we have  built these tabernacles and are erect-  ing these temples. We are trying  to keep the commandments of God,  and we shall continue to do so until  the kingdom of God is established  upon the earth to be thrown down  no more forever.    We expectd to be subject to all con-  stitutional laws of the land and main-  tain the constitution of our country  which we believe was given by in-  spiration and guarantees unto all  men the right to worship God accord-  ing to the dictates of their own con-  science. That is about all I wanted   to say. I desire, however, to bear  my testimony to the truth of this  work. No man will ever gain any-  thing by taking a stand against this  kingdom. The Lord is going to  break in pieces every weapon that is  formed against Zion. He is going  to do another thing, too, and that is  every nation, kindred, tongue and  people that does not serve the Lord  in the latter days will be cut off;  for the Lord God hath spoken it.  Now, these are solemn sayings, but  they are neverthe less true.    I want the Latter-day Saints to  exercise faith in God. I want them  to be true and faithful, and not fear  what man can do. In the Scriptures  we read: "Fear not them who have  power to kill the body, but are not  able to kill the soul; but rather fear  him who is able to destroy both soul  and body in hell." That is a being  we should all fear to sin against; and  I rejoice when I see our young men,  the rising generation of Zion, will-  ing to take upon them the name of  Christ, willing to go forth and bear  record of the gospel of Jesus Christ,  willing to magnify the holy priest-  hood; for our young men have this  work to do. I hope, therefore, they   will qualify themselves for the work  of the ministry. We are not going  to stay here always. Many of our  brethren have passed away. I ex-  pect to follow them; I have never  comtemplated anything else. There  is none of us going to stay in the  world without death. The law of  death is upon all mankind, and all  will meet it in some shape or other.  Even Elijah, Moses, the inhabitants  of the city of Enoch, and the three  Nephites, who had a change come  over them and are on the earth to-  day, and perhaps visit us occation-  ally—understood this.    I desire during the few days I may  remain on the earth, to do all the  good I can. I want to strengthen  the faith of the Latter-day Saints; I  want to encourage the rising genera-  tion to keep the faith and qualify  themselves to inherit eternal life.  We have started out for celestial  glory. The man who rejects light  and truth may pay the penalty of  so doing, and will be deprived of the  privilege of going into the presence  of God and the Lamb. If the world  could only see and comprehend these  things, they would not treat lightly  the testimony of the servants of   God. But the devil rules over his  own kingdom; the Lord will rule  over his Saints.    I pray God, my Heavenly Father,  to bless us, that we may be faithful  to our God, faithful to the covenants  we have made; that we may exercise  faith in the Lord, and overcome the  world, the flesh, and the devil, and  inherit eternal life, for Jesus' sake.  Amen.

Price One Penny.    DISCOURSE  DELIVERED BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF AT THE GENERAL CONFER-  ENCE, SALT LAKE CITY, ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON, APRIL 7, 1887.    (Reported by Arthur Winter.)    WHILE the Sacrament is being passed   to this congregation, I will try to  make a few remarks; but whether or  not I shall be heard by this assembly  I cannot say.    If after the scene we have passed   through during the last hour any man  can answer his mind and satisfy him-  self before an assembly of this kind  to occupy the position that I do, un-  less he is assisted by the God of Is-  rael, he is made of different material  to what I am.  That which we have  had before us this afternoon is a testi-  mony to heaven and earth that what  has been presented here could not  have been witnessed in the midst of  any other people on the face of the  earth, unless that people were the  children of God.  Here we have had  ten thousand men and women lift up  their hands in a vote to sustain not  only the Presidency of the Church  and the Twelve Apostles, but other  men in their various positions, and  without a dissenting vote.  Where on  the earth can a scene of this kind be  seen except among the Latter-day  Saints?    I feel it my privilege, right and  duty to now make a few remarks  with regard to myself and the deal-  ings of God with me.  But before  doing that I will say that the Lord  has never set His hand, in any age of  the world, to perform a work among  the sons of Adam, but He has pre-  pared an element for that work.  You  will see this in the whole history of  His dealings with the human family.  It is so in the generation in which we  live.  The God of heaven, having set  His hand to carry out His great pur-  poses and decrees, which have been  revealed in the records of Divine  truth, has been under the necessity  of preparing a people to take hold of  and to perform the work which He  has decreed should come to pass.  Ten  thousand of that people are before  me to-day, with tens of thousands   throughout the land. 
 34    he said. He said that heaven and earth  might pass away, but not one word of  his should go unfulfilled. That is my  view with regard to it.    Now, I have no fears myself with  regard to this kingdom. It is the kingdom  Daniel sayw in vision; it is the kingdom  pointed out by all the prophets and  apostles in days gone by. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] And you look  at the history and travels of this people:  look at the progress made in the midst  of oppression and opposition of Presidents,  of Congress, of priest and people, and  we can see how we have been sustained  by the hand of Almighty God, and not  by the hand of man. This will continue.  As I before said I have no fears with 
 AN ADDRESS FROM PRESI-  DENT WOODRUFF    IN RELATION TO THE MANTI TEMPLE.    SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 20th, 1887.    To the Presidents of Stakes, Bishop  and Saints generally:    It is with profound feelings of grat-  itude and thanksgiving to our heaven-  ly Father that we announce to the   Latter-day Saints that the Temple  which is being erected at Manti has  been so nearly completed as to be  ready for the upholstering, furniture,  carpets, etc., which are necessary to  put it in a state of complete prepara-  tion for the sacred labors to be per-  formed therein. This is the third  building of this character which in the  kind providence of God the  Latter-day Saints have been per-  mitted to erect and finish in  these mountains. The Temple  at Salt Lake City is also progressing in  a satisfactory manner, which, when  finished, will be the fourth Temple  that has been constructed by the  Saints under the direction of the Al-  mighty since we came to these val-  leys.    How blesed are the peope who  have had these glorious privileges  granted unto them! Our hearts swell  with inexpressible feelings of thanks-  giving and joy to our Father in heaven  that he has permitted His Saints to  build these houses. They now have  opportunities to act as Saviors of their  fellowmen, which but few genera-  tions of the children of men have ever  enjoyed. The great work of the res-  toration of the dead which will occupy  the time and thought of fu-  ture [8]generations has now begun,  never more to end until the earth is  sanctified and the plan of salvation de-  vised in the eternal worlds for human  redemption is fully consummated.    Our object in addressing you in this   circular is to present to all the mem  bers of the Church the opportunity of  contributing, according to their means  and liberality, something towards the  furnishing of the Manti Temple. Here  tofore the contributions for that build-  ing have been confined to the Stakes  which are numbered in what is known  as the "Manti Temple District." Be-  fore the Logan Temple was completed  an opportunity was given to the  Saints to contribute towards  the purchasing of its furnishings, fur-  niture, etc. They gladly responded to  the call which was made upon them.  We feel that they will, on the present  occasion appreciate the privilege of  contributing in like manner towards  the purchasing of suitable upholstery,  carpetings, etc., for the Manti Temple.  The funds of the Superintendent are  exhausted; and contracts are already  made for needed articles, which have  to be met at an early date.    Contributions will be taken from  twenty-five cents upwards, so that  those who are the most limited in  means need not be debarred, while  those who are more wealthy, can have  the satisfaction and pleasure of  making donations according to their  ability for the completion of this  noble edifice. We would like the  Presidents and Bishops to give every  one an opportunity of doing some-  thing in this direction, and the names  of all, with the amounts contributed,  should be carefuly taken.    We would like to see the names of  every man, woman and child in the   Church recorded in the Archives of  the Temple as having contributed  something towards its erection and  completion.    These funds with the donors' names,  can either be forwarded to the office of  the Presiding Bishop or to the Chief  Clerk—Brother James Jack, at the  President's Office.    It is important that these collections  should be made and remitted as  promptly as possible, as the need for  this means is pressing.

We came and I am glad of it. Let me say right  here that we met five hundred of the sharpest thinkers, and most earnest  and intelligent teachers and students that I have ever seen in the United  States, and I have held a great many institutes in my day. We were  astonished beyond measure. What is the cause of this intensity of pur-  pose and concert of action? I will tell you. It is because the people who  came to this Territory had a terrible struggle for existence, and surmount-  ing all trials they turned this bleak waste into a veritable paradise and  transmitted the love of industry to the present generation. From such  an experience and school will come the greatest mental giants on earth."

 776 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.   THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1896,  AN ADDRESS.    To the officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day   Saints:    Dear Brethren and Sisters—It has been a practice in the Church of   Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sanctioned by the word of the Lord, to   fast and pray, and in this manner to seek for that faith which Saints  should possess, and obtain that spirit of humility which we are com-  manded to cultivate.    Shortly after the arrival of the people in the valley of the Great Salt  Lake, the first Thursday in each month was set apart as a day of fasting  and prayer.  The members of the Church were enjoined to bring on that   day their contributions for the relief and sustenance of the poor, and hand   them to the Bishop of the ward.    At the time of the adoption of this regulation it was very convenient  for the people generally to meet together in their places of worship on that   day.  The conditions were such that they, being of one faith, employers  and employed, could leave their labor and devote a few hours to the Lord.    For many years these meetings were well attended, and they were of a   most interesting character, and were a comfort and a strength to all who   shared in them, as it was the practice for persons of both sexes to bear  their testimony and take active part in them in each ward under the   direction of the bishopric.    As the years rolled by, conditions changed, and it became more difficult  for the people generally, and especially those in steady employment to   attend these meetings, until at the present time they have dwindled to   such an extent that comparatively few have the opportunity of attending  them.  Thursday as a day of fasting and prayer in the church no longer   serves the object for which it was intended.    Our attention has been called to this subject, and after mature delibera-  tion, it has been decided to change the day that has heretofore been   devoted to this purpose.  Instead of the customary assemblages in the   various wards throughout Zion on the first Thursday in each month, we   have concluded to set apart the first Sunday in every month as the day   for the regular fast meeting.    Hereafter, therefore, we desire the Latter-day Saints, under the direction   of the Presidents of Stakes and the Bishops, to meet in their several places   of worship on the afternoon of the first Sunday in each month, whenever   it can be done conveniently, and devote the meeting to the administration 
 35    regard to Zion, and the church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day-Saints. All the  fears I have is ^are^ with regard to ourselves.  The Lord can build up his kingdom with  few or many men. Our apostatizing  and turning away from the commandments  of God will only be an injury to ourselves.  It is not within the power of man  to stay the progress of this kingdom.  The Lord has called us as a people  to send forth the gospel of Christ   to the nations of the the earth and to gather  to these valleys of the mountains the  seed of Israel, the seed of Joseph, and  the seed of Abraham. This is being  done. The people who have ^been^ gathered

I hope I may have the faith and prayers of the  Saints of God unto this end.    I have some things upon my mind that I would like to speak of this  afternoon, if I can get the spirit of them. I will say that some of the   most interesting histoy of my life has been the time that I have spent  here in St. George, and in the Temple of God which was built here. There  is no eye that has seen, nor ear that has heard, nor has it entered into the  heart of man to conceive, the future reward that will be given these people  who dwell here and who have labored in the Temple of God. For myself,  I can say that I feel under deep obligation to the people who dwell here -   an obligation that I feel will last with me throughout all eternity. In my  early days there were two things for which I desired to live. One was the  redemption of the dead - my father's house, my mother's house, and the  progenitors who are in the spirit world, and who never heard the Gospel.  I have been preserved in the flesh, as one of their descendants, to hold the  keys of their salvation and redemption, the same as you have for your  progenitors, whom you are called to redeem and labor for here in the flesh  This has been a work that I have greatly desired to do for years that are  past and gone, and through the blessing of the Lord and the assistance of   my brethren and sisters who dwell in St. George, I have lived to see it  accomplished to a great extent, which I look upon as one of the greatest  blessings God ever bestowed upon me. So I look upon it with regard to   all of us.    The Lord has had certain purposes in gathering us together, and the re-  demption of our dead is one of them. And when I reflect upon the work  which the Latter-day Saints have been called to perform in these latter  days, I rejoice before the Lord that I have lived in this day and generation,  and that I have been numbered among the Latter-day Saints who have  been called to perform these great and mighty works which are necessary  to be performed before the coming of the Son of Man.    The building of these Temples in these mountains of Israel is among the  marvelous events of the day in which we live. Of course, we built   Temples before we came to these valleys; one in Kirtland, and one in   Nauvoo. I was not at the dedication of the Temple in Kirtland ; but I   was present at the dedication of the Temple in Nauvoo. The history of  these Temples you have before you. You know the Prophets were slain,  and the Lord required the building of that Temple at the hands of the  Saints before they were driven into the wilderness. There was a certain  revelation given that inspired in a great measure the Elders of the Church  of God to perform that work. They labored with all the power they  possessed, and they accomplished that work. They went into that Temple   and received ordinances and endowments before they left to go into the  wilderness. These Temples that we have built here stand as a monument   before God, angels and men, to the faith and works of the Latter-day  Saints.    Brother George Q. Cannon has referred to your labors in settling here. 
 338     LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR    With regard to myself, I will say  that in my early youth, while read-  ing the Bible---the record of Judah,  and the New Testament---I read of  Jesus Christ, of His Apostles, their  works, and the dealings of God with  them, and of the doctrines which  they received and taught to those  around them.  There was something  glorious in those principles which the  Savior of the world and His disciples  taught in their day.  I had a great  desire in my boyhood and youth that  I might live to behold a people who  were inspired of the Almighty, and  who had power and authority to go  forth and teach those principles which  I read of within the lids of the Bible.  At that time I could not hear them  taught.  They were not taught by  any person within my knowledge.  But, as I have said, I had a longing  desire that I might live to behold a  people on the earth who would teach  these principles to me.  I spent many  a midnight hour in my mill, and  among the rocks, in the forests and in  the fields, in pouring out my soul to  God and praying that I might live to  behold a people on the earth who   would teach these principles.  In  answer to my prayers, the God of  heaven promised me that I should  live to find such a people.  He pro-  mised me that I should have a name  and a place within the House of God  and among His people---a name that  should not be cut off.  I am strongly  impressed to-day, in reflecting upon  our history and the history of myself,  and the position which I occupy, with  the promises of God to me in those  early days.  They have been fulfilled,  and this day has crowned the pinna-  cle of the responsibility which is  placed upon my head. I marvel  when I contemplate these things,   which are in fulfillment of the pro-  mises of God unto me. And when I  say this of myself, I speak of hun-  dreds of the Elders of Israel who  have been moved upon in the same  manner that I have been.  Those  with whom I stood connected in the  early period of the Church---the Pro-  phet Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith,   and those men that laid the founda-  tion of this Church and kingdom,  together with other prophets and  patriarchs---have passed away.  They  are on the other side of the veil.  I  still have the privilege of remaining,  and I this day have been called to  this responsibility in the midst of  my brethren---a responsibility that no  man can fill unless he is inspired of  God.    But I will say this to my brethren  and sisters, in the name of Israel's  God:  The Almighty will never per-  mit me, nor any other President who  holds the keys of the kingdom of  God, to lead you astray.  If I do not  walk in the paths of righteousness  and do what is right in the position  that I occupy, He will remove me out  of my place, or any other man who  attempts  to lead the people astray.  The position which I occupy, and  that occupied by my brethren the  Apostles, should not have a tendency,  if we have the Spirit of God, to make  us lifted up or exalted in our spirits  before the Lord.  I know, as the God  of Israel lives, that I have no power,  nor have I had, in this Church, to  perform any work pertaining to this  kingdom, until it has been given unto  me by the God of heaven.  I know  Joseph Smith had not, nor Brigham  Young, nor John Taylor, nor any  Apostle or Elder in this Church and  kingdom.  And the moment that I  attempt to become lifted up in the  pride of my heart, because of any  position that I hold, that moment I   become a very unwise man.  So with  anyone else.  The higher our posi-  tion the more responsibility.  Du-  ring the little time I may spend here  in the flesh, I stand in need of the  prayers of the Latter-day Saints---of  those who have faith in God.  So do  my brethren that surround me.  So  do all the authorities of the Church.  We all stand in need of the Holy  Ghost and the power of God.  With-  out this we are not qualified to fill  the positions which we are called to  occupy.    I know that this is the work of  God.  So do all you who have ever  had the testimony of the Holy Ghost  with you.  The God of heaven has  set His hand to establish His king-  dom, in fulfillment of the revelations  of heaven which He has inspired men  to declare and put on record from

THE following discourse was delivered by President Wilford Woodruff at   the Sixty-Eighth Annual Conference, in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,  Utah, on Sunday afternoon, April 3rd, 1898.    -[At President Woodruff's request, President Cannon read the 1st Section   of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.]-    I want the attention and the prayers of the Saints who have assembled   upon this occasion. I have been sick and very weak in my body for a   month past, and did not feel that I would be able to attend this Confer-  ence till the day before it opened. I have been blessed in this respect to  be with you. I desire to say some things to you, and perhaps some  strange things, too. I feel disposed to say something about myself, to   give you a little of the history of my life, because of what I may want  to say, before I get through, to the rising generation of Israel. My re-  marks may be very eccentric to any but Latter-day Saints, and to them   also, I expect.    I suppose when I was born the devil knew what I should be called to   do; for there have been from the day I was born until the present two   powers with me—one to kill me, the other to save me. I stand before  you to-day pretty sound-looking, for a man ninety-one years of age. I   stand before you with a body in which almost every bone has been broken,   except my back and neck. I have had through my life a power after me   to take my life. When I was about three years old I was pushed into a   caldron of boiling water, which had just been taken off the fire. My  grandmother took me out, and my skin all dropped off excepting off my  head and feet. I was wrapped up for months in cotton and oil. That   was the beginning of my troubles. When I was twelve years of age I  was drowned; at any rate, I lay in thirty feet of water long enough to 
 will be to you that this work has been  pushed by the sisters. Why I cannot  tell but this I know it has taken  much prayer and supplication to  God to carry the work thus far and  while we have the foundation laid  here to compel the reorganization  to assist in establishing the poor  in Zion, yet we must have more  means or some to supply the  present need. The cause of a woman  being chosen to begin and perhaps  direct the work for the present (subject  to the criticism or counsel of any  member of the church or any part  of it) ^so far as they shall know of it^ is for the purpose of doing  the work so quietly that the heads  of the church who are now Jealous  because the Lord has condi^s^cended  to listen to the pleadings of hone  of his handmaids (when she knew  not what else to do but go to the Lord) 
 36    here ^ are of the seed of Ephraim who have been scattered among the nations^ have been sifted as grain is sifted ^whose lives have been hid with Christ in God^  through a seive. ^and they knew it not.^ When the gospel came  to them they received it and have gathered  to this land. Hence we should be on  the watch tower. We should labor  faithfully in the work allotted to us. It  is an individual matter. My apostatizing  is not going to stop the progress of this  kingdom. Men have tried to use the  holy priesthood to build themselves up,  and the consequence has been that the  spirit of God has been withdrawn from  them and another has taken their  bishopric, crown, and kingdom. And  ^this^ will be so ^the case^ throughout the whole programme  of this Church and kingdom. No man

We feel assured that excellent results will follow the   giving of members of the Church an opportunity to bear their testimony   to each other and to seek for the gifts which the Lord has promised to   those who keep His commandments.    Care should also be taken on such occasions to see that the wants of the   poor are relieved by the contributions of the Saints in their behalf, that   no cry of the indigent or suffering shall arise from our land in the ears of   the Lord of Sabaoth.    In Salt Lake City, instead of the people meeting in the Tabernacle on  the afternoon of the first Sunday in each month, we have concluded that   it will be better for that service to be dispensed with, and for the Latter-  day Saints to meet in their several wards on that afternoon, so as to give   all the members of the ward, including the aged and infirm, and others   who are unable to go the Tabernacle, an opportunity to participate in   the fast meeting and share in the blessings of the occasion.  In other  Stakes where general meetings are held as in this city, we suggest that   they also be dispensed with on the first Sunday of each month, and that  the Saints meet in their places of worship in the several wards.    In some places the custom has arisen to consider it a fast to omit eating  breakfast.  This is not in accordance with the views and practice of   the past.  When fasts were observed in the early days, it was the rule to   not partake of food from the previous day until after the meeting in   the aftrnoon of the fast day.  In making donations to the poor also it has  been the understanding that the food that would be necessary for the two   meals should be donated to the poor, and as much more as those who are   liberally inclined and have the means may feel disposed to give.    In giving this counsel to the Church upon this subject, we include all   the missions where the Elders are laboring, either in the United States or   in foreign lands.  We think this arrangement will suit the convenience   and circumstances of all the Latter-day Saints throughout the world, and   we would like it to be observed by all the organized branches of the Church   in every land, so that our fasting and praying may be uniform and the   time be understood by all.    Before closing this address to the Saints, we feel led to say that if there   should be sickness or any evil resting upon or threatening the people,  these meetings furnish an excellent opportunity to bring such afflictions   and troubles before the Lord.  By approaching Him in the spirit of  humility and union, we can supplicate Him to remove these afflictions or   evils from the individuals or from the people.  Our past experience has  proved to us how willing our Father in Heaven is to hear our cries in the   hours of extremity and difficulty, when we approach Him in a proper  spirit and with proper faith.  He is quick to hear the cries of His people  and He has promised to us that if we will draw near unto Him, He will draw  near unto us.  Such occasions as these, therefore, ought to be taken advan-  tage of by the afflicted, whether in an individual or in a collective capacity. 
 as to avoid confusion and excitement  which would result in disaster and  division worse than there is now.  I have been in Independence for two  weeks past and I find property cheap  some selling at half what it cost  to build it and prospect for it to   come lower for about three months  But the Gentiles are looking for  the gathering of the saints there  and are only watching for them  to make the start and their they  intend to rais again. Thus I  see the necessity of doing every  thing quiet as possible, possibly  trying a good deal before much  moving is done and dealing  directly with owners instead  of agents to save any extra  expense. I mean that Zion shall  be clean and holy and pure in every

The destinies  of all nations and peoples under heaven  are in the hands of God, and when they  fight against this work they do not  know, any more than the Jews did,  what they are doing. Jesus said 'Father  forgive them ^for^ they know not what they  do.'  They did not understand the  foundation they were laying for suffering,  oppression, and persecution to come  upon their heads for 1800 years after  the death of the Messiah.  It cost   them 1800 years of affliction for  shedding the blood of the Lords anointed.  Yet the history is before the world 
 590    LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    You were called to come here by the servants of God.  You left your  homes to come here and you have done what was required of you in this  matter.  You have had power to finish the Temple, and you have had  power to go in and redeem your dead.  A great many of you have done  this, and I hope all of you will continue as long as you have any dead to  redeem.  Never cease that work while you have the power to enter into  the Temple.  I have greatly rejoiced at the hands of the Latter-day Saints  here.  Gold and silver are no comparison to these things.  I have had  some thousands redeemed here.  I have had baptisms, ordinations, wash-  ings and anointings, endowments and sealings for them, the same as if  they were standing in the flesh themselves.  I shall go and meet them on  the other side of the veil.  You will go and meet your relatives.  You will  hold the keys of their salvation to the endless ages of eternity, if you  attend to this labor for them.    There is no principle on earth that I rejoice more in than in the power  that we hold as Latter-day Saints to build these Temples, to go into them,  and to redeem our dead.  It will require immortal bodies, immortal spirits,  immortal revelations to enable men to comprehend the full extent of this  work; they cannot comprehend it in mortality.    Now, I desire to live to see the Salt Lake Temple finished.  I want to  be with my brethren the Apostles, the High Priests, the Seventies, the  Elders and all the authorities of the Church when that Temple is dedi-  cated to God.  We have been as long building that Temple as Moses was  leading the children of Israel through the wilderness to the land of  promise, and I would like to see it finished.    I view our position as Latter-day Saints, and all that is transpiring here,  as well as our history before we came here, as in fulfilment of the revela-  tions of God.  A great many of our friends felt had when we had to leave  our lovely Nauvoo to go into the wilderness.  It was a great trial to them.  But had that not taken place, the Bible and the Book of Mormon and  many of the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants would have fallen  to the ground unfulfilled.  This is the place pointed out by the finger of  God for the people to stand in holy places while the judgments of God go  forth in the earth.    It is marvelous in my eyes that I have lived to see the Temples that  have been built in these mountains of Israel and the mighty work that  has been performed in them, considering the condition in which we came  here.  A little handful of men, in poverty and affliction, came into this  barren desert.  I brought President Young in my carriage into the valley  of Salt Lake.  He was sick, and he asked me to turn my carriage so hat  he could get sight of the valley.  I did so.  He cast his eyes over the  valley and looked for some little time.  When he got through he said,  "Brother Woodruff, drive on.  Here is our home.  This is the place God  has pointed out for us to plant our feet.  I have seen this place before."

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.   339    generation to generation.  His hand  has been manifest from the beginning  of the work until the present day.  It will be until this scene is wound  up.  I have a great desire that, as a  people, we may be united in heart;  that we may have faith in the reve-  lations of God, and look to those  things which have been promised unto  us.  We should be humble before   the Lord.  Trace the history of Jesus  Christ, the Savior of the world, from   the manger to the cross, onward  through sufferings, mingled with   blood, to the throne of grace, and  there is an ensample for the Elders  of Israel, an ensample for all those   who follow the Lord Jesus Christ.  In meekness and lowliness of heart  He labored faithfully, while He dwelt  in the flesh, to carry out the will of  His Father.  God has laid upon our  shoulders and has sealed upon our  heads the holy and eternal priest-  hood, which is from eternity unto  eternity.  Without that priesthood  we have no power to administer in  the ordinances of the Gospel of Christ,  either for the living or the dead.  But with that priesthood we have  power to perform the work that is   assigned unto us.  By that priesthood  we have preached the Gospel, we have  administered in the ordinances of the  House of the Lord, and we have ga-  thered together the sons and daughters  of Zion into these valleys of the  mountains.    I feel as though I want to bear my   testimony to the truth of this good  old book, the Bible, for a few minutes --  the book that all the Christian  world profess to believe in.  There is  an effort made to-day by the infidel  and unbelieving world to ridicule the  Bible, as not being the word of the  Lord.  I will refer to a few things   that have been manifested in fulfill-  ment of the record.  To commence  with, I will touch upon the first deal-  ings of God with man.  The first son   that was begotten by Father Adam,  whose name was Cain, proved to be a  murderer.  He slew his brother Abel,  who held the priesthood and the  Lord pronounced a curse upon him.  He showed Cain the position he was  in, and told him what the result of  his crime would be; and Cain said  unto the Lord:    "My punishment is greater than I  can bear.    "Behold, Thou hast driven me out  this day from the face of the earth;  and from thy face shall I be hid;  and I shall be a fugitive and a vaga-  bond in the earth; and it shall come   to pass that every one that findeth me  shall slay me."    But the Lord said unto him:    "Therefore, whosoever slayeth   Cain, vengeance shall be taken on  him sevenfold.  And the Lord set a  mark upon Cain, lest any finding him  should kill him."    What was that mark?  It was a  mark of blackness.  That mark rested  upon Cain and descended upon his  posterity from that time until the  present.  To day there are millions  of the descendants of Cain, through  the lineage of Ham, in the world,  and that mark of darkness still rests  upon them.  Though nearly six thou-  sand years have passed and gone, this  mark is visible to the whole human  family.  Yet the fool and the infidel  say there is no God, and they ridicule  the Bible.    The Lamanites, on this continent,  suffered a similar experience.  They  went to war against the Nephites;  they thirsted for blood, and they  painted themselves red, and the Lord  put a curse of redness upon them.  Hundreds of years have passed since   then, but wherever you meet the La-  manites to-day, you see that mark  upon them.    -[TO BE CONTINUED.]-    SOME REMARKABLE TESTIMONIES.    THERE is much opposition to the claim  made by the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter-day Saints, that "it is the   duty of its members to recieve revela-  tion for themselves at any and at all  times ;" and however much this fact  may be doubted, those who "know  for themselves" are not disposed to

I was just  as dead as I shall be thirty years hence. I lay on my back and saw the  sun go out, and passed through all the sensations of death that any man  would in drowning. After an hour's labor, I was brought around to life  again. I shall not go into the particulars of many of these things, but I  have passed through what may be termed death a number of times in my  life. When I was 15 years old I was in one of those Connecticut blizzards.  I walked four miles through a wood into the open country, and I sought   some place where I could hide from the storm and rest. There was but   one house within a mile of me—that was the poor house, which was about   twenty-five rods away. The man was moved upon to go up in his garret   to get some pennyroyal to give to a sick woman, and he felt led to look   out of the window. He saw me crawling into the hollow of a big tree.  He knew what the result of that would be better than I did. He took  his horse and sleigh and came to me, and when he got there I was asleep,   and he preserved my life. When I was 14 years old I was bit by a mad   dog, and ought to have died; but I did not. So I continued on, until I   can say that I have broken both of my legs, one twice; broken both of my   arms, breast bone, several ribs, and altogether been through a pretty   hard experience for a man who had to be called to preach the Gospel, at   least. I was a miller by trade. I have been in two water wheels under   full head of water, and I suppose I ought to have been killed in either of  them, but I was not hurt.    That preserving power has followed me all the way through my life. It   has been with me upon my missions abroad as well as at home. It has   followed me until the present day, and I have been placed in a great many  strange places.    I was ordained to dedicate this Salt Lake Temple fifty years before it   was dedicated. I knew I should live to dedicate that Temple. I did live  to do it. I had a great desire in my boyhood to receive the Gospel of   Christ, to see a prophet or somebody that could teach me the Gospel of   Christ as taught by the ancient Apostles and as I read of in the New   Testament. I desired this with every sentiment of my heart, and on the  first Gospel sermon I ever heard I was baptized, with my oldest brother.    I immediately went to Kirtland. I was in Zion's Camp with the Prophet   of God. I saw the dealings of God with him. I saw the power of God   with him. I saw that he was a Prophet. What was manifest to him by   the power of God upon that mission was of great value to me and to all  who received his instructions. I will refer to one instance. A short time   before we landed in Missouri, Joseph called the camp together. He there  prophesied unto us, and told us what lay before us. He gave us the rea-  son why chastisement was before us. He said: "You consider me a boy  with the rest of you. You have not realized my position before the Lord.   But there is a chastisement before this camp." He told us that this would   come upon us because he had not been obeyed in his counsels. In one   hour after we landed in Missouri and pitched our tents at Mr. Burkett's,  one man began to fall here, another there, and in a few moments we had 
 tist minister" And the  minister lived near the Church,   three miles from there, and  we were directed to the place.  We made for the place and got to   the church in time for meeting in   the afternoon. A deacon met us at   the door. I told him to tell the min-  ister there were two servants of God   at the door who had a message to   deliver to the people of that island.  The minister kindly invited us up   to the pulpit, which invitation we   accepted, going up valise in hand.  We were entire strangers and of   course in that position, were the ob-  jects of interest to the congregation.    The minister asked us what we   wanted. We told him we wanted   to preach to the people. When?  This evening. After naming the  hour and giving out the notice, he   invited us to take tea with him at  his home. When we got into the  house, I took out the Bible, Book of   Mormon and Doctrine and Cove-  nants laying them one on the other   upon the table, but said nothing. By   and by he took them up and looked  them over in silence. After pausing  sometime I asked him if there was  a schoolhouse in the island. He  answered that there were five. "Are  they free to preach in?" "Yes." I  thought that was allright, and said no  more. He asked no questions.  When the time arrived we went to   meeting. I told the people the na-  ture of our mission, and recited to   them the history of the organization   of the Church of God upon the   earth; and then preached on the   first principles of the gospel. When   I got through Brother Hale bore  testimony. We then gave out no-  tices that we would hold meet-  ings at certain hours in the   various school houses, which ap-  pointments we filled. All this time  the minister was engaged reading  the Book of Mormon and the Doc-  trine and Covenants, and for days   he walked his room till midnight,  not knowing what to do, whether   to accept our doctrines and thereby   renounce his faith and lose his po-  sition, or to reject it. After consid-  ering the matter for ten days, dur-  ing which time he was supplying  our daily wants, he concluded to re-  ject our message, and from that time  he commenced to oppose us. But   no sooner had he closed his door  upon us that a sea captain invited us   to his home. We went with him   and succeded in baptizing him and   his brother, and also commenced  baptizing others. The minister see-  ing this and becoming alarmed,   went to the south island to get a   Mr. Douglas, a Methodist minister,   to come and help him to oppose the   Mormons. They combined together   and held a kind of convention. I   was present and heard this Mr.  Douglas tell a great many false-  hoods and also misquote Scripture.  When they got through I charged  them with telling falsehoods and  misquoting Scripture, and announc-  ed that on Monday evening we   would meet the people and ministers  by way of answering to what had   been said that night.  The conse-  quence was that I preached to this   Baptist congregation and baptized  every member that owned one  dollar in the meeting house and we   followed the Methodist minister to   his home in the south island and   succeeded in baptizing most of his   congregation. These are little inci-  dents in my early experience.    I have watched with a great deal   of interest the results of the   labors of Bro. Morgan in the South-  ern States, I myself having traveled   over some of the same ground and   been the means of bringing in the   Church many people from that   land, some of whom are alive and   living in Utah to-day. Here are  these Thomas' that are here—Bro.  Daniel Thomas is dead and I preach-  ed his funeral sermon. I baptized  his father and mother, he was an  old revolutionary soldier, who   fought under Washington, and was  between 80 and 90 years of age.  When I laid my hands upon his  head to confirm him a member of  the Church, I told him that he   would be gathered home with the   Saints and be buried with them.  This his son told me afterwards was   the only thing that ever tried his  faith, for he did not know the way   the old gentleman would be gather-  ed. The consequence was that   Brother Thomas was with the first   company who were gathered out of   the southern country. When he got   to Far West Father Thomas wrote  to his son Daniel to come and take   him to Far West, he went after him  and carried him up to Far West; and   three days after his arrival he died  there and was buried. We say a   great many things sometimes in  confirming people when under the   influence of the Spirit of God, that   appear to the natural mind almost   impossibilities, and which we do not  understand ourselves, only as the   Lord confirms them.    These, my brethren and sisters,   are incidents of my experience while  on my first mission.  Joseph Smith,   Brigham Young and the Twelve  Apostles have met with similar  things, for this is way we had   to travel in the early days. We al-  ways went without purse or   scrip, leaving our families   many times in the depths   of poverty. We left our wives in   poverty to go to England, after ful-  filling the revelation given on the   26th day of April, at Far West,  where, in obedience to the command   of the Lord, we laid the chief corner   stone of the temple. This was the   only revelation in which God had   given day and date requiring the   Saints to fulfil a certain thing by a   certain time.  When that revelation   was given, the bitter enemies of   this Church connived together and   swore by all the gods that if all   the other revelations of Joe Smith's  had been fulfilled, that one  should not be, because there was  day and date to it, and they would  see that it should not be fulfilled.  You know the history of that, how  that the Lord overruled so that ev-  erything was brought to pass to the   very letter.    We went to England and labored  energetically, the Lord crowning  our labors with great success. We  baptized 7,000 people. I myself   brought into the Church near 2,000,  most of whom were brought into the   Church in about eight months' labor  in the Herefordshire mission. After  spending one year in England with   the Twelve, and establishing the   Church there, we returned home in   peace and safety.    Now, I want to say to my breth-  ren and sisters, this is Mormonism;  this is the way we have lived. You   are in another condition; you have   lived 40 years since that day—from  1840 to 1880. You are located in the   Rocky Mountains, and you are filling  these mountains with Latter-day  Saints. You have go the kingdom   of God, and the Lord is with you,  and is very anxious that this  people should build up this kingdom.  In listening to Brother Pratt to-day  preach to us, and when I read the   revelations, and when I reflect upon  that grand and glorious vision which   God gave to Joseph, which marks   out the destiny of all men; and  when I consider that you and I have   the power while here in the flesh to   attain to the high and exalted posi-  tion in the celestial kingdom of God,  which is described in this Book of   Covenants, I feel that our aims   should be high, and that our privi-  leges here on the earth are all that   we should ask for. What are gold   and silver, what are the monopolies  of wealth which Brother Morgan   has spoken of as existing in the east.  What, I say, are immense riches   in the hands of a few men compared  to the blessings of eternal life? Why,  bless your souls, the men who wield  this wordly power are, as a general  thing, men that will go down to hell  when they shall pass away; in fact,   they are in the same situation as  the man referred to by the Savior  who wanted to build larger barns  and storehouses, and of whom the   Son of Man said, Thou fool, this   night thy soul shall be required of  thee. As I remarked to the Relief  Society of Provo a week ago, so say   I now, if I could live 1,000 years here   in the flesh, and had to labor in pov-  erty and hunger all the days of my   life, and if by my acts and course of   labor I could secure unto myself the  privilege of having my wives  and children with me in the   morning of the first resurrection and   could have them with me in my   family organization in the celestial  world, to dwell with me in that state  and glory, I should feel amply repaid;  it would more than reward me for   any trials and inconveniences and   troubles that I may have to endure  here. As Brother Morgan has said   to you so say I to this people to-  night, the world know not the na-  ture of the treasure we have, they   never did nor can know while they   reject the truth as it is offered to   them. But while it is a painful   thing to see men reject and oppose   the gospel, and stand ready to per-  secute those who have been willing   to sacrifice their all in order to pro-  claim it to a fallen world, I say,   while this is painful enough to a con-  siderate Latter-day Saint, it is not  near so bad as when men apostatize  and deny the truth; of all things un-  der heaven I dislike to see, it is to see  men who have once known the   truth and seen the light, turn round  and deny that which they have   known and seen. I can bury Latter-  day Saints, I can see my brethren  and sisters laid in the silent tomb  who have received of the ordinances   of the House of God, and who have   been true and faithful unto death,  without feeling to mourn; but after   traveling with men, as I have done,  for years and years, and heard them  bear record that they knew that this   was indeed and of a truth the   Church and Kingdom of God, and  after being valiant for the cause for  40 years, then turn and deny all,  deny God and every principle of life  and salvation, in this there is some-  thing truly sorrowful.    Brethern and sisters, let us live  our religion and keep the faith and   labor to overcome the world. What  Brother Morgan has said respecting   the condition of our nation is true  as God is true. This nation nor the   world know not what awaits them  neither do the Latter-day Saints un-  less they possess that spirit which  partakes of the things of God and   reveals them unto man. There are  great changes at your door; there   are great changes awaiting Zion;  there great changes awaiting our   own nation, and there are great   changes to come upon Babylon.  And the elements financial, social  and political, which have been re-  ferred to this evening, will be used  by the Lord to overthrow this power-  ful nation, and I know it, and bear  testimony of it; although men gen-  erally know not, and seemingly care  not to know, but I know the hand  of God is in these things, and he will  rule and overrule in these material  matters, and although not interfer-  ing with men's agency, he will so   order things that men will on natur-  al principles bring about their own  destruction and they alone will be   to blame for it because their cup will  be full. God says in a modern re-  velation that he is angry with none  save those who refuse to acknow-  ledge him in all things. The world   of mankind does not acknowledge the  hand of God in anything. The sins  of this generation are ascending up,  like smoke out of a pit, before high   heavens, and the anger of the Lord  is kindled against the wicked and   ungodly, and his angels stand ready   to receive the command to go forth  and reap down the earth. This   time must come sooner or later; the   days of the reign and rule of sin and   wickedness are numbered, and the  destruction of the wicked will come   upon them like a thief in the night   and when they shall be marrying and   giving in marriage and engaged in   all kinds of revelry.    The wicked do not seem to know  that it is a fearful thing to fall into   the hands of a jealous God.  There   are a thousand cases of murder to-  day where there was but one when   this Book of Mormon was translated   and sent forth to the world, and a   thousand cases of whoredoms and   adultery where there was one then.  In those days both law and virtue  were respected and honored; but af-  ter this word had gone forth to the   people and had been treated with in-  difference and rejected by them, the   Lord commenced to withdraw his  Spirit from them, until to-day it  finds little, if any, place in their  hearts, and as a consequence, Satan  has control over them and they are  fast ripening in iniquity, and the   whole earth is ready for judgment;  and there will be none to deliver.    Since my return from the south,  the question has been asked me a   number of times if I had received a   revelation while in the south. It  does seem strange to me that such a  question should be asked. We have   twelve Apostles and their counsel-  ors, who are upheld by the Latter-  day Saints in general conference as-  sembled, as prophets, seers and reve-  lators; and is it a strange thing that   they should receive a revela-  tion? There are, say 5,000   Seventies in these mountains who  hold the Melchisedek priesthood, as   well as many thousands of High  Priests and many thousands of El-  ders who also hold a portion of the  Melchisedek priesthood, and is it a   marvel or a wonder that God should  give a revelation to anybody? What  an idea! The marvel to me is that   prophets and apostles should live at  all without revelation.    If we build up the Kingdom of  God we shall see the necessity of re-  ceiving constant aid from our Father  and God to direct us in carrying out  to fulfilment his great and glorious  purposes.    The judgments of God await the  world and the nations that live to-  day, when the inhabitants shall be-  come fully ripe in wickedness. As  the Lord lives all the revelations  of God concerning them will surely   come to pass. Therefore prepare  yourselves, ye Saints of the latter-

 way but must be brought about  quietly, kindly, prayerfully, and with  an eye single to the Glory of God.  I have now laid the matter before  you and ask that you make a  prayerful investigation of the  circumstances surrounding  the move and then see what   can be done towards raising  such a fund for the immediate  of Zrelief of Zion or those who now  are ready to serve God to the end  of time. They are striving to trust  in God till relief can come.    If you are able to assist I will  gladly and carefully account for  all expenditures to the body once  a month or counsel at any time  with any whom the church may  appoint for such consultation.  These homes might be made ^out^

Now, on this day "the God of heaven  shall set up a kingdom which shall  never be destroyed; and the kingdom  shall not be left to other people, but   it shall break in pieces and consume  all these kingdoms and it shall stand  forever."  The stone cut out of the  mountains shall roll forth until it  fills the whole earth. A little one shall  become a thousand and a small one  a strong ^nation^. The Lord has said that in the  Latter-days a standard should be raised  to the gentiles and they should be gathered  together; that the gospel should go first  to the gentiles and then to the Jews.  These sayings are on record. If the

Men came from California,  among them Brannan, who urged us strongly to go to California, saying  that it was such a fine country, and we were there in a barren desert.  But President Young said, "This is our home.  Here we shall build the  Temple of God and the city of our God."  I think this has been plainly  fulfilled.  The inspiration of the Lord was with President Young all  through his life, and the result of it is manifest.  I traveled with him in  the first settling of this country.    Where is there a man that has the spirit of inspiration but can see the  hand of God in these things?  We have had our day of affliction, of per-  secution and poverty.  All earth and hell, if I may be allowed to use such  an expression, were combined against the Prophet Joseph Smith, from the  time this Church was organized until he was slain in the flesh, and the  same spirit continued through the life of Brother Brigham Young.  But  we came to these valleys of the mountains, and from the day that we  planted our tents in Salt Lake City there has been a degree ofo prosperity  resting upon this people, and it has increased year by year until to day.  The Lord has been with us.  Blessings have been poured out upon the  Latter-day Saints, and we have had plenty of food and raiment.  But I  hope that none of us will get proud and lifted up in our hearts so that we  shall forget the hand that has given unto us these things.  [TO BE CONTINUED.]

I preface these  remarks with an "if"; because it is  only by living our religion and keeping  the commandments of God that we  will prevail. The hand of God is in this  work. We have our records to look up, and  we will have power to go into the temples  and redeem our dead. Already more than  100,000 have been baptised for in the temple  in St. George since it was dedicated, and  more than ^about^ 50,000 have received their endow-  ments there. The work of the Lord will   continue in this way. But a small   portion of this church have been able

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENIAL STAR. 387    a dozen of our camp stretched upon blankets with the cholera. The  Prophet of God, when he saw this, felt to sympathize with them, and he  and Hyrum laid their hands upon Brother Carter, the first man that was   taken sick, but as soon as they did it they were seized themselves, and   they both had to leave the camp. He said afterwards: "I told you what   was coming to pass, and when affliction came I stretched out my hand to   stay it, and I came very near falling by it myself." That mission was very   interesting to me.    I want to say here that in all my life since joining this Church and   kingdom, notwithstanding these powers that have been with me to kill   me, I have always had the revelations of God with me. That is something  I want to talk about to Israel before I get through. The power of God   has told me what to do and what not to do. While the devil has had  power to afflict my body very seriously, there has been a power with me   that has saved me through it all. And, whenever I have had the Holy   Spirit with me to tell me what to do, I have had to do that. By that I   have been saved. By listening to that still small voice I am here to-day   with you. There are two reasons why I am here to-day. When I went  back after the pioneer journey, President Young said he wanted me to  take my family and go to Boston, and stay there till I could gather all  the Saints of God in New England and Canada and bring them to Zion.    That was the mission he gave me on my return from the pioneer journey   to Winter Quarters. I went in the spring, as he told me, and took my   family. We came one evening to one of the brethren's houses in Indiana.    Several of us were there. Orson Hyde had a team as well as myself. We  drove into a long yard. I set my carriage within six inches of his. I had   my wife and children with me. I tied my animals to an oak tree on the   other side of where we camped. I went to bed in my carriage. As I laid   down, the Spirit of the Lord told me to get up and move my carriage. I   did not ask the Lord what He meant. I did as I was told. The same   Spirit told me to go and move my animals away from that tree. I did   that. My wife asked me why I did it. I told her I did not know. I had   not been in bed twenty minutes when there came a whirlwind and took   that oak tree, which had stood there perhaps fifty years, split it right   through the trunk, and it swept through both of those fences where my   carriage had stood. It never touched Brother Hyde's carriage, but it   would have crushed me and my family to the earth if I had not listened   to the voice of the Spirit. After spending two years and a half in New  England and Canada, getting the Saints out, I started back with the last   lot, about a hundred, from Boston. We landed in Pittsburg at dusk. We   were anxious not to stay there, but to go on to St. Louis. I saw a steamer  making steam ready to go out. I went to the captain and asked him how   many passengers he had.

The keys of  the holy priesthood have been given to  us in our day and generation. The hearts  of the fathers are being turned to the children,  and the children to the fathers. The old  patriarachs and prophets saw this day.  They understand us. They are watching over  us.

They do this solely to see what they  may in that brief time, of the civilzation planted in the wilderness  by your people. Of course they must go to you for guidance in their  observation.

If I had not obeyed the influence   of that monitor within me, I would have been there myself, with the rest  of the company. The Thirteenth ward would not have had an Atwood  for a Bishop; the Church would not have had a Leonard W. Hardy as  Bishop. They were both with me, and their families, including Brother   Samuel Hardy, who is in St. George now, upwards of ninety years old.  I never disobeyed that Spirit but once in my life; I did it then through   the agency of other persons, and it nearly cost me my life. I have been  acquainted with this Spirit. It was not the blow of trumpets nor thunder  and lightning; it was the still small voice to me. All the way from my   boyhood I have been governed and controlled by that Spirit. My mis-  sions have been by that Spirit of revelation. I was told to go to Fox  Islands by that same still small voice.  In the time of the great apostasy  in Kirtland the Spirit of the Lord said to me, "Get you a partner and go   to Fox Islands." I knew no more what was in Fox Islands than what was   in Kolob. I went there, however, baptized a hundred and brought them  up to Zion with me. It was upon that island where I received a letter  from Joseph Smith, telling me that I was called by revelation to fill the   place of one of the Twelve who had fallen. You will see it in the Doctrine  and Covenants. That thing was revealed to me before I received the   letter from Joseph Smith, but I did not feel disposed to tell it to any   mortal man, for I knew it was my duty to keep such things to myself.  Through all my life and labors, whenever I have been told to do anything   by the Spirit of the Lord, I have always found it good to do it. I have   been preserved by that power. That power was with me when I went   to Herefordshire. I was preaching every night with Brother Cordon,  and one night we held a meeting in the town hall at Hanley, in Stafford-  shire. The Spirit—that still small voice—said to me, "This is the last  meeting you will hold with this people for many days." I told the con-  gregation so when I got up. They were very much astonished, and asked   me where I was going. I told them I did not know. After, I went to   ask the Lord what he wanted of me, and He told me to go the south.  That was all the answer I got. I took the stage and rode eighty miles   south. The first man's house I went into was John Benbow's. I had not   been in his house fifteen minutes till I understood why the Lord had sent   me there. There was a people broken off from the Wesleyan Methodists,  who had banded together and called themselves United Brethren. They   were watching for the coming of the Son of Man, watching for the Gospel  of Christ, as they read of it in the New Testament. The first thirty days   after I got there I brought into the Church some two thousands, with   fifty ministers, and all their chapels, licensed according to law, were in my   hands. There was no blowing of trumpets about that. The Spirit of the   Lord told me to go there, and when I got there I saw why I was sent.    That is, perhaps, enough to say about those things. Now, I want to say   to this congregation, to the young men of Israel, to the Elders of Israel,  to all our missionaries, the day has come when the God of heaven requires  at my hands, as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day

 days, for that which awaits you;  for judgments will begin at the   House of God, and from there it will   go forth to this and other nations as  it has never before been known, un-  til the whole earth shall be cleansed  from wickedness and the way made  straight for the coming of our Lord.  I would repeat the counsel that   has been sounded in the ears of this   people for these many years. Let  us live our religion and have the   fear of God in our hearts. Some of  us are not going to remain here  very much longer; we will pass  away, but we have boys and girls  growing up who will carry on the   great work of salvation and redemp-  tion which God is establishing in  the earth. I have strong feelings   for the welfare of our boys and girls.  I look at the evils around them,  which beset their pathway in life,  which are the means used by the   devil to overthrow them; and he  seeks the overthrow of this whole  people; and he will overthrow every-  body that can be overthrown. There-  fore, I would say, teach your boys   and girls the principles of the gospel;  teach them to pray unto God, to call   upon him that his spirit may rest  upon them and touch their hearts,   that they may be led in the paths  of righteousness, and thus be saved  from the evils of the world. I am  pleased to see so many of our young  persons interest themselves in the   principles revealed from heaven for  our guidance and salvation, and  hope and pray that they will con-  tinue in well doing, for upon their  shoulders, as I have often said,  must sooner or later devolve the re-  sponsibility of carrying on this work.  I believe there are a great many of  our sons and daughters in these  mountains who will not taste of   death, whose bodies will not lie in   the grave, and they will live in the   flesh until Christ shall come, to be   caught up to meet him in the air.  We have got to exercise faith in   God and call upon him, and draw  near unto him and thus prepare our-  selves for the things which await us   in life.    I feel as though I have said  enough.    I pray God to bless you, and to   bless the holy priesthood, the Apos-  tles, the Seventies, the High Priests,   and all who bear the priesthood in   this generation. Let us maintain  our integrity to God and live so as   to be at last worthy of the high and   exalted position that we are aiming  for in the heavens, for to lose this  through falling away, it would have  been better for us had we never been  born, and far better to have been  taken away in our youth. It is a   warfare all the time for man, woman  and child; and that we may fight   the battle of life, and overcome the   world, the flesh and the devil, and  be prepared for eternal life, is my   prayer, in the name of Jesus.  Amen.

But as it requires extra  strength to go up and down stairs  all necessary rooms should be  on first floors, and nothing more  than store room above, and that  only for large families.    If we have only such things as  can be put to a good use so much  room will not be needed, and  as  all will be employed in building  and raising the necessary crops  (which will have good market close  by). Those to be established are not  able to educate their children and  so by the help of the children every  ^family^ can be self sustaining. The extra  moments aside from work time  improved by the children, together  with prayer and supplication  will bring knowledge that is useful

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR. 389    Saints, to say unto you, it is the will of God for you to take this course.  Get the Spirit of God before you go on your missions or anywhere else.   Get the Spirit of revelation with you. And when you get that you are   safe, and you will do exactly what the Lord wants you to do. I have felt  strongly impressed to say that to this Conference. What can you do   without revelation? We cannot do the will of God and accomplish what   is required of us without it. We will make no mistakes if we pursue that   course. That spirit is with the Apostles, and with the Elders of Israel  who are true and faithful. The rising generation should labor to obtain  the Spirit of God. Get it within you and it will be a continual monitor  within you.    That is one reason, brethren and sisters, why my life has been preserved.  I will tell you another reason. Of course, this is my own reason for it.  One reason why I am here is because the Lord has chosen the weak things  of this world to preach the Gospel, to do His work, to build up His king-  dom. I do not think He has ever had a weaker instrument on earth to   work through than myself. The Almighty has known that never for a   minute since I have been a member of this Church have I had any power  to take any honor or glory to myself with regard to anything that I have   been enabled to do in the work of the ministry or elsewhere. Why?  Because I have known it has come from God, and not from me. And no   other man who has engaged in this work has had any power of himself.  This power has come from God unto us, whereby we have been enabled to   do the work He has required at our hands.    There is a change coming over the earth; there is a change coming over   the Christian world; and it is at our door. You read the revelations in   the Bible, in the Book of Mormon and in the Doctrine and Covenants  appertaining to our day and the generation before the coming of the Son   of Man. War! Yes; war is one of the troubles that belong to the genera-  tion in which we live. It will come to pass, and no power beneath the   heavens can stay it. Who cannot open their eyes and see the change in   the things around us? Read these revelations—the revelation just read   by Brother Cannon, and the others in these books. The God of heaven  has set His hand to carry out these great purposes that you read of.  They are as sure to come to pass as that God lives. There is no power on   earth, nor beneath the earth, nor anywhere else, that can stay the fulfill-  ment of these things. And they are at our doors.    I am anxious that the Latter-day Saints shall round up their shoulders  and bear off the kingdom of God. Many in the world have labored to try   to overthrow Mormonism. They have driven our people from their   lands. They have persecuted and afflicted us. They have put some to   death, for the word of God and testimony of Jesus. But they have not  thwarted the purposes of God in any of these things. The Lord, in His  mercy and wisdom, has led this people to these valleys of the mountains.  It is ordained of God that Zion is to be established here. Here is the   Tabernacle that the Prophet spoke of as a covering from the storm and   the wind, etc. These temples are here in fulfillment of prophecy. We  have four of them in this State.

 instead of so many theories which  are contrary to the word of God  and lead to infidelity in time.    Now there is another thought  to express and ^that^ is this. That  as the subject of building the  temple is sometimes agitated  and it is generally supposed  that those who have the money  will build it and some great  person of architict will design  and direct it, and so forth. Now  there are reasons why this is not true.    First, as Nephi of old also the  bro. of Jared both did exceeding  fine workmanship after having  talked with the Lord and receiv  ed their direction, ^so^ He  is is just  as able to so direct us as hHe  did them.

He lived long enough to dedicate the   corner stone of this Temple on this block, into which the Latter-day   Saints go and deliver their friends who are in the prison house, and   attend to the ordinances of the house of God for them, in fulfillment of   the ancient Prophets, who spake as they were moved upon by the Holy   Ghost, to the effect that saviors should be raised up on Mount Zion in the   latter days while the kingdom is the Lord's. Zion has got to arise.    "Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing,  O mountains; for the Lord hath comforted His people, and will have  mercy upon His afflicted.    "But Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath for-  gotten me.    "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have com-  passion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not  forget thee.    "Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls   are continually before me." (Isaiah 49:13-16.)    All that has been spoken concerning Zion will come to pass, and you   and I to-day are witnesses of these things.    We are here for salvation and eternal life. We are here to obtain those   great blessings which Saints of God in every age of the world have   obtained when they have obeyed the commandments of God. Shall we  fail? No, we shall not if we do our duty. The Gospel is just as good to-  day as it was in the days of the Savior. As to the glorious blessings of   the Gospel of Christ, they have been unpopular in almost every age of the   world. Take Christ Himself: where was there a more unpopular man   than the Savior of the world in His day? And His Apostles were un-  popular. They were put to death for the word of God and testimony of   Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, Christ was the Son of God; and the Sadducees,   the Pharisees, the Essenes, and all the sects that warred against Him were  cursed and many of them were cast down to hell, while He remains as the   Savior of the world, and received the honor and the glory which His  Father had ordained for Him. I want our young people especially to  remember these things. Those who are going upon missions must not   neglect them. Unless you have the Holy Ghost with you when you go   out to preach the Gospel, you cannot do your duty; but when you have   that you are safe, go where you will, and your words will have their effect   in the hearts of the honest and meek of the earth.    Brethren and sisters, I feel to thank God that we are as well off as we  are. I feel to thank God that we are in the position we occupy in these   valleys of the mountains. Here is a safe place. While in the dedication   of that Temple I saw the judgments of God that were about to be poured  out upon this generation. They will come to pass. I read the other night   of a terrible flood. Who ever heard of such a flood in America before?  These floods, and troubles and tribulations are increasing in the earth, and  they will increase until this scene is wound up. I pray God my heavenly   Father to bless you all, to inspire our hearts, that the vision of our minds   may be open to comprehend the position we are in and the responsibility 
 will with loving ^hands^ assist in the  building of the temple and if  they have to spend every moment  in the support of their families in-  stead of witnessing with the rest  their love for his work it will  be such a disappointment as  will spoil the unity of spirit  and love toward one another.  Thus, when the saints are gath-  ered to Zion the Lord will pro-  vide for the temple, both material   and workman.    I have a case of libel here against  some of the officers which when  carried through the different  courts will provide some  means for the redemption  of Zion and every cent will  be used for the purpose but  it will probably be one year

 D H Cannon  St George Septr 29th 1877    Elder Wilford Woodruff;  Dear Brother—    I have received  two short notes from you, the news   contained therein was cheering, as  anything, which contains that which  is favorable to the intrests of Zion  is of intrest to me, these labors   of which you speak, as having ^fallen^ on   to the Shoulders of the Twelve, added  to the labors that were already  resting upon their Shoulders, and  they have a burthen, which God  alone can give them the necessary  strength to perform. The Death  of our beloved President has cast  a gloom over the entire community  yet, there is a degree of resignation   that one could scarcely have antici-  piated; which clearly indicates that 
 In the first place, I will say that   the Prophet Joseph taught us that   Father Adam was the first man on   the earth to whom God gave the  keys of the Everlasting Priesthood.  He held the keys of the Presidency,   and was the first man who did hold  them. Noah stood next to him.   These keys were given to Noah, he  being the father of all living in his   day, as Adam was in his day. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:40-52##]  These two men were the first who  received the Priesthood in the eter-  nal worlds, before the worlds were  formed. They were the first who   received the Everlasting Priesthood   or Presidency on the earth. Father   Adam stands at the head, so far as  this world is concerned. Of course,   Jesus Christ is the Great High   Priest of the salvation of the human  family. But Adam holds those keys  in the world today; he will hold  them to the endless ages of eternity.  And Noah, and every man who has  ever held or will hold the keys of   Presidency of the Kingdom of God,  from that day until the scene is   wound up, will have to stand before  Father Adam and give an account   of the keys of that Priesthood, as   we all will have to give an account   unto the Lord, of the principles that  we have received, when our work is   done in the flesh.    Brother Cannon has given my   mind with regard to Joseph Smith.  I look upon Joseph Smith as the   greatest Prophet that ever breathed   the breath of life, excepting Jesus   Christ. Father Adam, as I have   said, stands at the head; but Joseph   Smith was reserved to lay the foun-  dation of this great Kingdom and   dispensation of salvation to the  whole human family in these last  days, to build up Zion, to establish  God's Kingdom, and to prepare it  for the coming of the Son of Man.  He held those keys. Brother Can-  non has told you the truth. No other   man held those keys while he lived.  After him, as has been said, came   Brother Brigham. I have traveled  with Joseph Smith thousands of  miles. There are some here tonight   who were in Zion's Camp. He was  a boy, in one sense of the word.   He was but a young man when he  was martyred and passed into the   presence of God. His days were   comparatively few. But he was a   great man. He lived a long life for  a few days. He performed an al-  mighty work—as great a work as   any man, save Jesus Christ, that  ever lived on the earth. We knew   him. We knew the Apostles. We   knew Brother Brigham; he was a   glazier and painter, and, in one  sense of the word, an illiterate man.   But God raised him up to do a great   work and to follow in the channel of   Joseph Smith. He magnified his  calling. He led this people to these  mountains, and he built up this   country almost from one end of it   to the other, by his counsel. The  Lord took him to Himself. Brother  Taylor followed, until he was taken   away.    Now, all of these men were what  the world would call weak instru-  ments in the hands of God.  I have   been asked the question many times,   "Why did the Lord choose Joseph  Smith to bring forth the Book of   Mormon and to lay the foundation   of this great Kingdom here on the  earth? Why didn't He choose Dr.   Haws, Dr. Porter, Mr. Beecher, or   some great man?" I have never  had but one answer in my life to all   such men, and that is, "The Lord  could not do anything with them,  because of their unbelief, and their  unwillingness to acknowledge His   hand in all things." That is the   reason the Lord has chosen weak   instruments to do His work. And   I will say here, if any of you want   a weaker instrument than Wilford   Woodruff to hold the keys of the   Kingdom of God, you ought to be  ashamed of yourselves. The Lord,  however, is just as able to inspire  me, or Brother Cannon, or any   other man, when the time comes, as  He has inspired other men in past   ages. I know what the will of God  is concerning this people, and if  they will take the counsel we give  them, all will be well with them.    Now, I want to make a few re-  marks concerning myself. I never  like to do this; but I want to give   you a little of my experience in a  few things, and I want to tell you  where my strength lies, and the  greatest evidence that any Elder of   Israel can have, ever did have, or  ever will have on the face of the   earth with regard to the work of God.    Speaking of the administration of   angels. I never asked the Lord in   my life to send me an angel or to  show me any miracle. I wanted  the Gospel of Christ; and the first   sermon I ever heard preached in   this Church I had a testimony for  myself that it was the Gospel of  Christ. I had a testimony to satisfy  myself when I was baptized. I had   been looking, praying, hungering  and thirsting to find some man on  the face of the earth who had the  Priesthood, and who could teach me  the Gospel. When I heard this ser-  mon, I knew the voice; I knew the   shepherd; I knew it was true. And   from that day until this, I have   never seen one moment in my life   that I have ever had doubts with  regard to it. I have never had any  trial in this Church with regard to   my faith. My trials have been of   another nature. I have had the   administration of angels in my day  and time, though I never prayed for   an angel. I have had, in several  instances, the administration of   holy messengers. In 1835, at Broth-  er A. O. Smoot's mother's house   in Kentucky, I received a letter   one day from Joseph Smith and   Oliver Cowdery, requesting me to   stay in Kentucky and Tennessee   and take charge of the Church   there. He wanted David Patten   and Warren Parrish to go to Kirt-  land to receive their endowments.  Joseph said in that letter: "You   shall lose no blessing by pursuing   this course." That letter was a great   joy, a great comfort and consolation  to me. I had traveled with Joseph  Smith to Missouri. I had been  acquainted with him, and I knew   he was a Prophet of God. In the  evening of that day I went into a   little back room, in which was a   small settee. I was alone. I was   overwhe[lm]ed with joy and consola-  tion at the letter I had received and  the encouraging words it contained.   I knelt down and prayed. I arose  from my knees and sat down. The   room was filled with light. A mes-  senger came to me. We had a long   conversation. He laid before me   as if in a panorama, the signs of the   last days, and told me what was   coming to pass. I saw the sun  turned to darkness, the moon to   blood, the stars fall from heaven.   I saw the resurrection day. I saw  armies of men in the first resurrec-  tion, clothed with the robes of the  Holy Priesthood. I saw the second   resurrection. I saw a great many   signs that were presented before me.   by this personage; and among the   rest, there were seven lions, as of   burning brass, set in the heavens.   He says, "That is one of the signs   that will appear in the heavens be-  fore the coming of the Son of Man.   It is a sign of the various dispensa-  tions."    Now, had I been an artist, on the  next day I could have sat down   at my table and drawn, as clearly as  though I had studied them all my   life, everything I saw. I went to  meeting the next day, with Brother   Smoot. I hardly knew where I   was. I did not comprehend a being,  scarcely. I was entirely over-  whelmed with what I had seen the  night before. 
 44    and converse with them, but between ^him and^ those for  whom he had not officiated there was a  barrier, he could have no intercourse with  them. Of course this is a dream, but  there are many truths sometimes in  dreams, and if this dream is not exactly  fulfilled,yet there is ^yet^ an important principle  connected with it. Although the testimony  dead many hear the testimony of Joseph  Smith and the Apostles and those that  are in the spiritworld—although they  may receive their testimony, yet they  cannot receive the blessings of the gospel  until they are relieved from prison, they  cannot receive their wives, nor wives  their husbands, and associate with them,  and be prepared to have a part in

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR. 391    we are under. The eyes of all heaven and earth and hell are over us.  The eyes of the devils are over us. They labor for our destruction; but   they have not the power to do it. We are in the hands of God. He holds  the keys of the destinies of the inhabitants of the earth, and He will bless   the righteous, no matter who they are nor where they are. I am thankful  to listen to the teachings that I have heard at this Conference from the   Elders of Israel. I rejoice in the progress that has been made during the   past year in the Church abroad. There has been an addition to the Church   that we have never met with in any other year since the organization of   this Church. And here at home there has been a great addition. Our   sisters have labored faithfully in the Primary Associations, in the Mutual   Improvement Associations, and in every capacity in which they are called to   labor. The blessings of God are with them, and they are doing much good.  The Sunday schools have also added to their numbers. They have now   over one hundred thousand members. The Young Men's Mutual Improve-  ment Associations, as has been said, have an addition of about thirteen  thousand as a result of their labors the past year. God is blessing those   who labor among them. If you can save a soul from death, what blessings  you will have with that soul. As the Lord said to Oliver Cowdery, "If  it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this  people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your   joy with him in the kingdom of my Father." We should continue in this   labor, that we may gain the salvation of the souls of men. Inasmuch as  you will do this, the blessings of God will attend you.  Zion has got to   arise or fall. Which shall it be? The proclamation of the Gospel of   Christ is in favor of Zion. All the revelations appertaining to this day   are in favor of Zion, and of preparing the way for the coming of the Son   of Man. And Zion will arise and shine.    God bless you, one and all. Let us do our duty and seek to magnify  our religion, that when we get through we will rejoice in that. It is   better to be on the Lord's side than anywhere else. I want salvation. I   want to meet my forefathers and my friends whom I have labored here to   redeem, who never heard the Gospel in their day and generation. God  has given us this privilege. We have Elders of Israel laboring in all these   temples day by day for the salvation of the children of men. We have   been blessed in this labor, and we will continue to be blessed; and when  we get on the other side of the veil there is not one of us but will rejoice  for the good we have done. May God bless you. I feel to bless the   Latter-day Saints, as far as I have power to bless. Our daughters and  our mothers are laboring for the salvation of Israel in their line, and so   are the Elders of Israel in their line. But we want to increase and con-  tinue to increase, until we have power in the earth to gather up all the  honest and meek of the earth. God bless, guide and direct us all in the   path of truth and righteousness, for Jesus' sake. Amen.    WE must be as courteous to a man as we are to a picture, which we are   willing to give the advantage of a good light. 
 Some of you have read the history   of the power of the devil in Eng-  land, when the fallen angels that   are upon the earth made war upon  Brother Kimball, Brother Hyde,   Brother Fielding and Brother Rus-  sell, who had all they could do to   live in the midst of that kind of   warfare. These evil spirits knocked  down Brother Russell and Brother  Hyde. They didn't Brother Kim-  ball; but that power fell upon him.   His eyes were opened. He saw the   spirits before him; he saw what  kind of beings they were. They  gnashed their teeth; they were mad;   they wanted to destroy the lives of  the brethren. These men held the  Priesthood. Brother Kimball held  the keys of the Priesthood, so far as   England was concerned. These   spirits had not, therefore, the power  to destroy them.    Brother Kimball, Brother George   A. Smith and myself had a similar  experience in London, at a house   where we were stopping. It seemed  as if there were legions of spirits  there. They sought our destruction;  and on one occasion, after Brother   Kimball had left, these powers of  darkness fell upon us to destroy our  lives, and both Brother Smith and  myself would have been killed, ap-  parently, had not three holy mes-  sengers come into the room and  filled the room with light. They  were dressed in temple clothing.   They laid their hands upon our  heads and we were delivered, and   that power was broken, so far   as we were concerned. Why   did the Lord send these men to us?   Because we could not have lived  without it; and, as a general thing,  angels do not administer to anybody   on the earth unless it is to preserve   the lives of good men, or to bring   the Gospel, or perform a work that  men cannot do for themselves. That  is the reason Moroni and other  angels of God visited and taught   Joseph Smith. They quoted to him   whole chapters in the Bible—in   Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel—and  told him what must come to pass in  the last days. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:30-47##] It was necessary for  these angels to give him the Priest-  hood. There was no mystery at all   with regard to what was taught  him. He knew it was of God.   These very principles sustained Jo-  seph Smith from the hour the   Gospel was delivered to him until   he sealed his testimony with his   blood.    Now, I have had all these testi-  monies, and they are true. But   with all these, I have never had  any testimony since I have been in   the flesh, that has been greater   than the testimony of the Holy   Ghost. That is the strongest testi-  mony that can be given to me or to  any man in the flesh. Now, every   man has a right to that, and when   he obtains it, it is a living witness   to him. It deceives no man, and  never has. Lucifer may appear to   man in the capacity of an angel of   light; but there is no deception with  the Holy Ghost. We do not par-  ticularly need the administration of   angels unless we are in a condition   similar to that in which Brother   Kimball, Brother Smith and my-  self were placed, when we could not  save our lives without them.    I say to you, as Brother Cannon   has, the Kingdom of God is here.   The Priesthood is here. The keys   of the Kingdom of God are  here. They will remain here.   It makes no difference whether   Joseph Smith, Brigham Young,   John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, or   anybody else, remain; while these   keys are here we have a right to   know the mind and will of God; and  when we do our duty, when we live   our religion, we shall have these   principles manifested to us. I know   what awaits this nation. I know   what awaits the Latter-day Saints.  Many things have been shown to me  by vision and by revelation. I know   that the Latter-day Saints have need  to repent of all their darkness, all  their unbelief and all their disunion  that they have in Zion. Our power,   our salvation, our exaltation, our re-  demption, our glory and our prepa-  ration for the coming of the Son of  Man, depend entirely upon our own   acts. As was said today, if we are   not united, we shall be chastised by  the power of God. But the Lord   said: "Fear not, little flock, the  kingdom is yours until I come." [##Doctrine and Covenants 35:27##]  No matter if earth and hell com-  bine against us, we are in His   hands, and He has said that He will   guide and direct the affairs of the  Kingdom. The Lord is no different  today from what He was in the days   of Adam, of Enoch, of Christ, of   Joseph, of Brigham. The Latter-  day Saints should seek for the Spirit   of God. We have great power and  great blessings given unto us. As  has been said here, look at our   condition today, and compare it   with what it has been in years   past. Some of you were ac-  quainted with our former condition.   Here is Brother Philo Dibble. He  was in Jackson County. He was   shot through the body; but his life   was preserved by the power of God.   We were driven away; our property   was burned and destroyed. The  Lord told us to importune at the   feet of the Judge and the Governor,  and if they did not heed us, to im-  portune at the feet of the President.   And if the President would not   heed us, then the Lord would come  forth out of His hiding place, "and   in His fury vex the nation, and in  His hot displeasure and in His fierce   anger, in His time, will cut off those  wicked, unfaithful and unjust  stewards, and appoint them their  portion among hypocrites and unbe-  lievers, even in outer darkness,   where there is weeping, and wail-  ing, and gnashing of teeth." [##Doctrine and Covenants 101:86-91##] Do   you think the Lord told the truth?  Yes, He did; and not one jot   or tittle will fall unfulfilled.   If our nation does not give us our   rights; if they continue to oppress  and persecute us, these things are in   the hands of God. More than 50  years ago the Prophet Joseph re-  ceived a revelation which said:   "Behold, verily I say unto you,   the angels are crying unto   the Lord day and night, who  are ready and waiting to be sent  forth to reap down the field." [##Doctrine and Covenants 86:5##] These  angels wanted to go and reap down  the earth. But the Lord said in   effect, "No; wait till the earth is  warned; wait till the nations of the  earth have the Gospel of Christ  preached unto them; wait till they  have a chance to repent and receive  the Gospel, if they will. When this  is done, then you may go down."    Brethren, the heavens are full of  judgment. And as the Lord told  the people at the commencement of   this work, "If the nation will re-  pent, if they will obey my law and  keep my commandments, I, the  Lord, will save these judgments;   otherwise they shall be poured out,  as I, the Lord, have spoken." These  things are true. The judgments of   God will increase from this hour,  until the land is deluged in blood.   War will overtake our nation. The  civil war, the war between the  North and the South, which laid in   the dust nearly a million of men   and cost the nation many hundred  millions of dollars, was only the be-  ginning of suffering. Had this na-  tion listened to the counsels of Jo-  seph Smith and heeded them, this   war and the terrible suffering which   it entailed would have been avoided.   But the judgments of the Lord are   not yet ended. He is going to fulfill   His work.    Now, my object, and your object,  is—at least it should be—to try to do  our duty. I have got to meet the  Apostles; I have got to meet the El-

 ders of Israel; I have got to meet  Father Adam, in the Kingdom of   God in the heavens; and we have all   got to give an account to him, as our  Great Progenitor and the first man   who held the keys of the Priesthood   on the earth. When I go there and  meet him, I shall have to render an   account of what I do here. The  Lord has chosen the weak things of  the world to do His work. But He  is as able to teach me, or any of   my brethren, as He ever has been  in any age of the world. He has  always selected the weak things.   Take Moses in leading the children  of Israel. Moses said he was slow   of speech, and he thought that he  could not do anything. But the  Lord said he would raise up a spokes-  man for him. When the Lord want-  ed a king for Israel, he chose David,   the son of Jesse, who was herding  sheep. All the sons of Jesse, except  David, were brought before the   Prophet; but Samuel would not  anoint either of them. He asked   Jesse if he had any more sons. Jesse   said, Yes; there is a little fellow   down here taking care of the sheep.   The Prophet wanted to see him.   When he came, Samuel anointed   him king of Israel. [##1 Samuel 16:2-13##] So in the days   of the Apostles. Who were they?   Illiterate fishermen. So it is to-  day. Begin with Joseph Smith and   take the whole of us. Who are  we? We are poor, weak worms  of the dust. But the Lord has  chosen us because He thought He   could do something with us. I   hope He can. I suppose I have  held the Apostleship longer than   any man that has been on the face   of the earth in these last days.   Should I boast over this or be proud  and exalted because I have held the  Priesthood so long? If I did, I   should be a very foolish man. We  are obliged to honor God; we are  obliged to acknowledge the hand of   God. The devil has sought to de-  stroy me from the time I was born   until the present day. But the Lord  has always been on my right hand   and saved me. There have been  two powers at work—one to destroy  me, the other to save me. And I  am here today, a weak instrument   in the hands of God. But, as God  lives, if He will tell me what my  duty is, I am going to do it!    I pray God to bless us, and awak-  en us that we may see our position  on the earth. The eyes of all heav-  en are over us. The Father, the  Savior, Father Adam, the Patri-  archs, the Prophets, and all the  Apostles who have lived in our day  and generation, are watching over  us, and waiting for us to do our   duty; and when we perform that,  the judgments of God will be mani-  fest in the earth. I pray God to give   us wisdom, and to help us to be  humble, faithful, meek and lowly of   heart. Look at the purity of the  Savior, from the manger to   the grave, and where is there a  man on the face of the earth that can  feel anything like exaltation or  glory? I have seen Oliver Cow-  dery when it seemed as though the   earth trembled under his feet. I   never heard a man bear a stronger  testimony than he did when under   the influence of the Spirit. But the  moment he left the kingdom of God,  that moment his power fell like  lightning from heaven. He was   shorn of his strength, like Samson   in the lap of Delilah. [##Judges 16:15-19##] He lost the   power and testimony which he had   enjoyed, and he never recovered it  again in its fulness while in the  flesh, although he died in the  Church. It does not pay a man   to sin or to do wrong. Brother  Cannon spoke about difficulties be-  tween ourselves. What business   have we to go to law because of   a little water or anything else on   the earth? When we do this we  have lost the Spirit of the Gospel.  You have had good counsel with re-  gard to this, and if you carry it out  the blessings of the Lord will at-  tend you. I hope the people of  Provo will look to this. We should   be united and stand together in the  midst of the opposition that we will  have to meet. I hope this power  and influence will dwell in this   county and throughout these moun-  tains of Israel, which may God  grant, for Christ's sake. Amen.

 for yourselves.    Carefully preserve all letters that they  may be had for future reference   either for me or against, and no  matter what the success of the work  maybe, never put them into print,  for it is a failure ^of the^ people if a  man or woman bring forth a  good work by the help of the Al-  mighty, to immediately begin to praise  that person and exalt them which  nearly ^always^ means downfall to that  person.

 REMARKS  By President Wilford Woodruff, at  the Sanpete Stake Conference,  held at Manti, Sunday and Mon-  day, May 19 and 20, 1889.    REPORTED BY A. WINTER.    After an absence of five years,  through the providence of God we  are again permitted to meet with  our friends in Sanpete. This is a  privilege that we greatly prize. It  is a great blessing to be able to come  here as free men, and to have the  opportunity of opening our mouths  and teaching the people as we are  moved upon by the Spirit of the  Lord. I have no right to say that  it has been so long since we preached  to the people that we have forgotten  how; but I have a right to say that  we are just as much dependent today  upon the Lord for His Holy Spirit,  to guide us in our teaching and in-  struction to the people, as we ever  were. And in order for us to enjoy  this blessing, we need the faith and  prayers of the Latter-day Saints 
 DISCOURSE  Delivered by President Wilford Wood-  ruff at the General Conference,   Salt Lake City, on Sunday after-  noon, April 7, 1889.    REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.    While the Sacrament is being   passed to this congregation I will   try to make a few remarks; but   whether or not I shall be heard by   this assembly I cannot say.    If after the scene we have passed   through during the last hour any  man can answer his mind and sat-  isfy himself before an assembly of   this kind to occupy the position that   I do, unless he is assisted by the  God of Israel, he is made of differ-  ent material to what I am. That   which we have had before us this   afternoon is a testimony to heaven   and earth that what has been pre-  sented here could not have been  witnessed in the midst of any other   people on the face of the   earth, unless that people were  the children of God. Here we have  had ten thousand men and women   lift up their hands in a vote to sus-  tain not only the Presidency of the   Church and the Twelve Apostles,  but other men in their various po-  sitions, and without a dissenting  vote. Where on the earth can a  scene of this kind be seen except  among the Latter-day Saints?    I feel it my privilege, right and   duty to now make a few remarks   with regard to myself and the deal-  ings of God with me. But before   doing that I will say that the Lord   has never set His hand, in any age   of the world, to perform a work   among the sons of Adam, but He  has prepared an element for that   work. You will see this in the   whole history of His dealings with   the human family. It is so in the  generation in which we live. The   God of heaven, having set His hand   to carry out His great purposes and  decrees, which have been revealed  in the records of divine truth,   has been under the necessity of pre-  paring a people to take hold of and  to perform the work which He has  decreed should come to pass. Ten   thousand of that people are before  me today, with tens of thousands   throughout the land.    With regard to myself I will say  that in my early youth, while read-  ing the Bible — the record of Judah,   and the New Testament — I read of  Jesus Christ, of His Apostles, their   works, and the dealings of God  with them, and of the doctrines   which they received and taught to  those around them. There was   something glorious in those prin-  ciples which the Savior of the world   and His disciples taught in their   day. I had a great desire in my   boyhood and youth that I might live   to behold a people who were in-  spired of the Almighty, and who   had power and authority to go forth   and teach those principles which I   read of within the lids of the Bible.  At that time I could not hear them  taught. They were not taught by   any person within my knowledge.  But, as I have said, I had a long-  ing desire that I might live to be-  hold a people on the earth who  would teach these principles to me.   I spent many a midnight hour in  my mill, and among the rocks, in  the forests and in the fields, in pour-  ing out my soul to God and praying   that I might live to behold a people  on the earth who would teach these  principles. In answer to my pray-  ers, the God of heaven promised me   that I should live to find such a peo-  ple. He promised me that I should   have a name and a place within the  House of God and among His peo-  ple — a name that should not be cut   off. I am strongly impressed today,  in reflecting upon our history and  the history of myself, and the posi-  tion which I occupy, with the   promises of God to me in those early  days. They have been fulfilled; and   this day has crowned the pinnacle   of the responsibility which is placed  upon my head. I marvel when I  contemplate these things, which  are in fulfillment of the promises of   God unto me. And when I say  this of myself, I speak of hundreds  of the Elders of Israel who have   been moved upon in the same man-  ner that I have been. Those with   whom I stood connected in the  early period of the Church — the  Prophet Joseph Smith, Hyrum   Smith, and those men that laid the  foundation of this Church and king-  dom, together with other Prophets  and Patriarchs — have passed away.  They are on the other side of the  veil. I still have the privilege of

 THE   DESERET WEEKLY.  PIONEER PUBLICATION OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION.  TRUTH AND LIBERTY.  ESTABLISHED JUNE, 1850.    NO. 8.  SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, SATURDAY, AUGUST 17, 1889.  VOL. XXXIX.    REMARKS  By President Wilford Woodruff, at  Grantsville, (Tooele Stake Con-  ference), Monday Morning, July  29th, 1889.    REPORTED BY A. WINTER.    I am very much pleased at the re-  port whch we have heard from the  President and Bishops of this Stake  of Zion. I do not know of any  Stake that we have visited that has  given as good a report, considering  all things, as has this Stake of Zion.  I rejoice that you are united, for  union is what the Lord requires  of the Latter-day Saints; and if we   are not one, we cannot be counted as the Lord's.    Among other things, I am very   much gratified at the report con-  cerning our young people. I have,   I may say, peculiar feelings with re-  gard to the rising generation in  these mountains. I reflect a great  deal concerning them and what   before them. The organizations  among the young people are of vast  importance, and the Lord has great-  ly blessed these organizations, in rais-  ing up men who have been inspired  to labor in connection therewith.   These Associations have proved a  blessing in years that are past, and  they are a blessing today. Here  are the Primaries. Our sisters or-  ganize the children together in   these Societies. This is the first  step after they leave, as it were, the  instruction and teaching of the  mother. The fathers sometimes  teach them, I suppose; but, as a  rule, we regard the mother as the   one who gives shape to the charac-  ter of the child. I consider that  the mother has a greater influence  over her posterity than any other  person can have. And the question  has arisen sometimes, "When does  this education begin?" Our proph-  ets have said, "When the spirit life  from God enters into the taber-  nacle." The condition of the  mother at that time will have its  effect upon the fruit of her womb;  and from the birth of the child, and  all through life, the teachings and  the example of the mother govern  and control, in a great measure,  that child, and her influence is felt  by it through time and eternity.    Our children go to the Primaries.   There they are taught the first prin-  ciples of the Gospel and about the  birth of Christ. This lays a founda-  tion for them to build upon. From  the Primaries they go to the Sab-  bath Schools. We have a very  large number of children—over  sixty thousand—enrolled in   Sabbath Schools. President George  Q. Cannon has taken an active part  in the organization and conducting  of these schools. He was inspired  to do this, and they have been a  great blessing to this people. From the  Sabbath Schools these children  go to the Young Ladies' and Young  Men's Improvement Associations,  there to continue improving them-  selves. When we call for Elders to  go abroad on missions we almost in-  variably choose those who have  graduated in this manner.    Well, I will tell you some of my  thoughts and feelings with regard  to our young men and maidens.  Of course, I know and you know  that this is the Kingdom of God.  I know that this is the great and  last dispensation, which the God of  heaven ordained before this world  was created; for I believe that the  Almighty knew what He was going  to do with this world before He  made it. He knew what kind of  spirits were going to occupy it, and  what kind of work would have to  be performed in order to save His  sons and daughters who should  come upon the earth. And in read-  ing the history of the dealings of  God with men, from the creation of   the world to this dispensation, we  see the Father has labored to bless   His sons and daughters. He gave  His only begotten Son to die to re-  deem the world—a sacrifice such as  only God himself could give. And  in these last days He has com-  menced the organization of the great  and last dispensation—the great-  est of all dispensations. Adam,  Enoch, Moses, and the prophets saw  our day. They had before them the  vision and revelation of this work,  and they prophesied concerning it.  Now, the Lord has labored with us  for nearly sixty years since the  organization of this Church. It has   grown like a little child from its   mother's breast. It has grown like a  mustard seed, until it is becoming as  a tree, for the fowls of the air to  lodge in the branches thereof. Its  history has been very peculiar in  some respects; but it has laid the   foundation for a great deal of faith  in the minds of the honest and   meek of the earth. We have had a  warfare right from the time when  Moroni first visited Joseph Smith,  before the latter received the plates. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:49-54##]  Lucifer and all his evil spirits have  labored for the destruction of   work. They labored to defeat, if   possible, the going forth of the Book  of Mormon—the stick of Joseph in  the hands of Ephraim. [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##] Joseph  Smith himself, only fourteen years  after the Church was organized, was   martyred. He had his blood shed,   as a testimony of the truth of his  mission. I have traveled with  Joseph Smith many hundred miles.  I have also traveled with Brigham  Young and the Apostles, and I have  never had any doubts with regard  to the truth and final triumph of   this work. I have none today. I   have no doubts about Zion becom-  ing all that the prophets saw it, in  its glory, its power, its dominion  and strength, with the power of   God resting upon it.    In view of all these things, the  question which has arisen in my   mind, and which has caused me a   good deal of thought, is, who is   going to take this kingdom and  bear it off? Unto whom is the  Lord going to look to take this  kingdom in its final triumph and   prepare it in its perfection and glory  for the coming of the Son of Man?  To our sons and daughters. It is  these young men and maidens who  dwell in these valleys of the moun-  tains that have got to asume this re-  sponsibility. Upon their shoulders  this kingdom has got to rest, when  their fathers and elders have passed   to the other side of the vail. This  is before me just as plain as the   light of the sun in the firmament of   heaven. And when I consider this,   I ask myself, what condition are   our young men and women in? 
 DISCOURSE  BY  ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  Delivered in the Tabernacle, at  Logan, Sunday Morning,  August 1st, 1880.    REPORTED BY GEORGE F. GIBBS.    It is a common saying with us, that   the Lord has set his hand to build   up his kingdom; but, notwithstand-  ing, it is a true one, and it is a very  interesting one. Let us turn our  minds which way we will, as men  of God, as Elders in Israel, if we en-  joy any portion of the Spirit of the   Lord, we cannot help seeing the  hand of the Lord in his works in  these mountains and in the earth.   It is a difficult matter, many times,  for men of the world to understand  the literal fulfilment of revelation;  in fact, some of our leading men,  men of wisdom, men who have en-  joyed a good portion of the Spirit of  the Lord—it has been difficult for  them to understand the fulfilment  of prophecy. In conversation with   persons with regard to the affairs of   our nation, I remember President   Young telling them that there would  be a division in our nation between  the North and South. "But," said   they, "that cannot be; the stability   of our government is of too durable   a nature to even permit of any such  thing." This is the way that our  leading men felt before the rebellion;   this is the way, as a general thing,  that leading men feel to-day. They   cannot comprehend, it is not in their  hearts to believe in the fulfilment of  prophecy; they cannot understand  how it is that any power or wisdom  that God can exercise can bring to  pass the prophecies that remain to  be fulfilled. We had examples of  this, as I have said. But the crisis   came; a four years' war was waged,  which laid in the grave a million  and a half of the strength of our na-  tion, and, as I have often said, and  which I believe is true, cost them a   debt which they will never live to   pay. They could not comprehend  this until it was over. It is so with  our nation to-day; they cannot  comprehend, notwithstanding the   mighty evidence that is rolling be-  fore them like the waves of the sea,  one event after another in their ful-  filment; but they cannot realize how  the Lord can make use of the ele-  ments known to mankind to bring  about the destruction of a nation like  ours. When Brother John Morgan   was speaking, I was reminded of a cer-  tain spirit that arose in the hearts of  men a few years go, incited through   theoppression of capital against labor.  A few men rose up in Pittsburgh and   other places in Pennsylvania, and  in three days destroyed some twenty   million dollars worth of railroad  property. When this element once  rises, what power has law, what   power have the officers of the law or  the government to control it? It   cannot be controlled by human   power. As Latter-day Saints, we  can in a measure understand, when  we come to reflect that God rules  and overrules and can do anything  he has a mind to with regard to the  fulfilment of these events. I believe   the Bible; I believe the Book of Mor-  mon; I believe the Doctrine and   Covenants, and I believe that the  predictions they contain will in their  fulfilment roll upon our heads, and  upon the heads of this nation, and   upon the heads of the people of Zion,  and the judgments of God, that have  been proclaimed in the hearing of  the people for the last fifty years,   through the mouth of Joseph Smith  and of Brigham Young and the apos-  tles and the elders of Israel, by the  gift and power of the Holy Ghost—  not one jot or tittle of what has been  declared will fall to be ground un-  fulfilled, and the Latter-day Saints  ought to be prepared for them. I  know many of these things look   dark when men look upon them  with the natural vision, and as a   consequence doubt and unbelief fol-  low; but when you look upon them   with your mind enlightened by the  Spirit of God, the spirit of inspira-  tion and revelation, we then are able  to understand them, and how easily   it is for God to bring to pass the pre-  dictions of his servants.    The Lord, in a revelation given to  Orson Hyde and William McClellan  in the early days of the Church, in  sending them out to preach the gos-  pel, told them that when they   preached they should speak as they  were moved upon by the Holy   Ghost; and that if they did not have   the Holy Spirit to direct them, they  were told not to teach. "And,"  said the Lord, "when you do speak   as you are moved upon by the Holy  Ghost, your words are the words of   God, they are scripture, and they  are the mind of the Lord to the peo-  ple." (##Doctrine and Covenants 68:4|Sec. 68.##) Many have an idea  that it is something very strange for  men now-a-days to have revelation,   and that nobody should have revela-  tion excepting Brother Taylor.   Here, my brethren and sisters, you  are upholding the quorum of the  Twelve twice a year in General Con-  ference, besides doing so at your   quarterly conference, as prophets,   seers and revelators, and you pray   for them twice a day, and perhaps   oftener, and should it be anything  very strange if they should receive  a revelation? How strange, indeed!   There are in this Church some six   thousand seventies, and four thou-  sand high priests, and four thousand   elders, who hold the Melchisedec  priesthood, which is after the order  of the Son of God, besides many  thousands of priests holding the  Aaronic priesthood, and I would like   to ask, if it was wrong to desire   revelation? What business have we   with this priesthood, if we have not   power to receive revelation? What  is the priesthood given for? If we  do not have revelation, it is because  we do not live as we should live,  because we do not magnify our   priesthood as we ought to; if we did  we would not be without revelation,  none would be barren or unfruitful.  We have one man who holds the   keys of the kingdom of God upon   the earth, and it is his business to  give the word of the Lord for the  guidance of the Church. But here  we have apostles and men of God,   holding the holy priesthood, acting   in behalf of the Church in different  parts of this Territory, and also in  different parts of the earth; and we   have men, say, acting as Church  agents in Europe, part of whose  business it is to charter ships for the   transit across the ocean of tens of  thousands of the people of God; is it  the right of such men to have reve-  lation from the Lord to guide them  in their operations? Yes, it is; and   no man should undertake to act in  positions affecting the interests of  Zion, unless he lives so as to be guid-  ed and directed by revelations of   God. And every man who presides  over a temple should live day by   day in the revelations of Jesus  Christ. And every seventy, and  every high priest, and every man  bearing the holy priesthood should   live in that way to get revelation to  guide and direct him in his labors.  This idea that no man has any right   to call upon God and receive revela-  tion is wrong, and it has been wrong  whenever it has existed in any age   of the world. As was said of old,  when a complaint was made con-  cerning certain of the elders prophe-  sying in the Camp of Israel, so say  I: "I would to God that all were   prophets;" because the spirit of   prophecy is the testimony of Jesus.    With regard to prophesying, I wish  to say, that we have a great many  times the revelations of God given   unto us through his spirit, when we   do not comprehend what revelation  is. How many of you have had the  still small voice of the spirit whisper   things to you, and when you have   followed the dictations of that spirit   it has become in you a principle of  revelation. I would not be here to-  day if I had not listened to the  whisperings of that still small voice  which has guided me in my journey-  ings; I never could have passed  through the dangerous scenes and   incidents of my life had I not fol-  lowed the whisperings of the spirit  of the Lord to me. And with regard   to our preaching I will say, that as  apostles of God and as men appointed   to lead and guide Israel, we have a   great many things presented to our  minds that at the time appear to be  beyond our comprehension. Brother  Heber C. Kimball, for instance, was   a natural prophet; he would at times   give utterance to things when  preaching under the influence of the   holy Spirit that would frighten   himself, and has many times been   known to say after he had finished  preaching, "What have I said?" I   am reminded of a circumstance   which occurred in the early settle-  ment of Utah, at a time when we  were all in very destitute circum-  stances, without the shadow of any  reasonable hope for seeing better   times. At such a time Brother   Kimball in preaching one day told   the congregation that many months  would not pass before we would be   able to buy goods in Salt Lake City   as cheaply as they could be bought  in New York City. When Brother  Kimball had said this he actually felt  frightened for he could not see how it   could come to pass, but it was spoken   under the influence of the Holy  Ghost and therefore it was revela-  tion. I was thinking to-day of a  time, many years ago, when President  Young and several of the brethren   of the Twelve, were in Logan; it was  a time when a railroad up to this  region was not even dreamed of, the   time when Brothers Ezra T. Benson   and Peter Maughan presided here;  when at a meeting President Young  called upon me to talk to the people  assembled. The night before, how-  ever, we had been met by a long   line of children and young people,   from 3 up to 20 years of age; they  had come out to meet the Prophet,   and presented a fine sight. While   talking to the people I felt led to   speak to the children and young peo-  ple; and I told them that I wanted  them to remember the visit which  the President was making them be-  cause the day would come when  they were grown up, when they   would talk to one another and say,   that on such a time President Young   and party visited us, and we were  told then that we should see the day   when a temple should be built in  this place, from the top of which we  would be able to survey the country   around which would be occupied by  ten thousand of our people; and you  will say that this was told to us  when Brother Benson and Brother  Maughan presided here. We never  thought of building a temple here  at that time, it had never entered   into the heart of men to do so. Bro-  thers Benson and Maughan have  been for some years now in the spirit   world. To-day you are engaged  building a temple which will be com-  pleted and dedicated to the name of  the Lord; and when this shall be   done these young people will have  the opportunity of going to the top  of the building and will then see  what I promised to you in those  early days.    I mention this to show you how   things are presented to our   minds and given utterance to in our  public teachings about which, at the  time, we have little or no idea.    When in the western country,  many years ago, before we came to  the Rocky Mountains, I had a dream.  I dreamed of being in these moun-  tains, and of seeing a large fine look-  ing temple erected in one of these  valleys which was built of cut gran-  ite stone, I saw that temple dedi-  cated, and I attended the dedicatory   services, and I saw a good many   men there that are living to-day in   the midst of this people. And I saw   them called of God and sent forth   unto the United States and to Baby-  lon, or what is called the Christian   world, to bind up the law and seal   up the testimony against the nations   of the earth, because they had re-  jected the testimony of Jesus and of  the establishment of the kingdom of   God upon the earth. When the  foundation of that temple was laid I   thought of my dream and a great   many times since. And whenever   President Young held a council of  the brethren of the Twelve and talk  of building the temple of adobe or   brick, which was done I would say  to myself "No, you will never do it;"   because I had seen it in my dream   built of some other material. I men-  tion these things to show you that  things are manifested to the Latter-  day Saints sometimes which we do  not know any thing about, only   as they are given by the Spirit of  God.    I will say to Israel who are here to-  day, we should take hold of this   work in earnest and build this tem-  ple and redeem the dead as well as   the living; and have faith in God   believing that this is the work of   God which will roll on to its fulfil-  ment in the earth. God will not dis-  appoint you in these the last days;  he will not disappoint the wicked, he  will not disappoint the devils in hell,   nor the angels of God in the heaven  will not be disappointed with regard  to the fulfilment of the revelations;  whatever may be the unbelief of   this generation it will make no differ-  ence with regard to the fulfilment   of the revelations of God and the   predictions of his servants.    When in the Tabernacle at Salt  Lake City on the 24th of July, in  looking upon the assembled mul-  titude and in contemplating the  magnetude and grandeur of the pro-  cession I said to myself "What can  be the feelings of the world?" What   can be the feelings of our enemies  who are laboring to "break up   Mormonism'" and who have for  these many years past indulged in  the fond expectation, and have  even gone so far as to predict  year after year that in a few   years more "Mormonism" will be   done away. The world do not   know what to do with "Mormon-  ism;" the heads of our own nation  and the kings of the earth are alike  undecided, with regard to this hand-  ful of people that are growing up in  these mountains. They see our  union and the work already accom-  plished by us; they see the elements  of prosperity and power manifested  in this people, and although they do  not say it themselves it is a fact, the  spirit of fear to a degree is taken  hold of them, they are afraid that  the "Mormons" tell the truth when   they say the God of heaven has set   his hand again for the last time to  establish his rule and government  in the earth, which is destined to  become a great kingdom and fill the  whole earth. The great men of the  earth are not ignorant of the exist-  ence of this people; they are studying  our history, and they are watching   the result of our labors. Although  we are located in the interior of this  mountain country, and so recently   considered without the pale of civ-  ilization, the Latter-day Saints are  not hid from view, their light is not  under a bushel, but they are already   known and talked of throughout all   Christendom; and this Zion will   continue to grow and no power will  hinder it. Let us prepare ourselves  and keep the faith, obey the com-  mandments of God and exercise faith  in these things; and let our prayers as-  cend into the ears of the God, of Sabath  day and night, for the fulfilment of  these revelations and prophecies.    The Lamanites will fulfill all that  God has said about them, and the  Jews will fulfill and realize all that  has been said respecting them and   all that has been promised and pre-  dicted upon their heads by their  father Jacob and by the prophets.  It was foretold by the prophet Moses  that they should be driven and des-  pised by their enemies, and that  they should be cursed of God, and   that his curse should follow them  until Christ came; and that they   would reject him, and then they   would be scattered as corn is sifted  in a seive,etc. [##Amos 9:9##] But hear it all Israel,   after your sorrow and pain and dis-  tress and after the days of your trib-  ulation, your great Eloheim will   stretch out his hand and gather you   from every nation wherever you are   driven, and he will bring you home  to your own land, and you shall re-  build, your temple and city, and you  shall be delivered by Shiloh when   he comes. That will be fulfilled;   and all that God has said with re-  gard to the ten tribes of Israel,   strange as it may appear, will come   to pass. They will, as has been said  concerning them, smite the rock,  and the mountains of ice will flow  before them, and a great high way   will be cast up, and their enemies   will become a prey to them; and their   records, and their choice treasures   they will bring with them to Zion.  These things are as true as God lives.    When I contemplate the condition   of our nation, and see that wicked-  ness and abominations are increas-  ing, so much so that the whole heav-  ens groan and weep over the abomi-  nations of this nation and the na-  tions of the earth, I ask myself the   question, can the American nation   escape? The answer comes, No; its  destruction, as well as the destruc-  tion of the world, is sure; just as  sure as the Lord cut off and de-  stroyed the two great and prosperous  nations that once inhabited this  continent of North and South Amer-  ica, because of their wickedness, so  will he them destroy, and sooner or  later they wili reap the fruits of   their own wicked acts, and be num-  bered among the past.    I cannot help it; I would to God   they would repent, that their eyes   might be opened to see their condi-  tion; but the devil has power over  them; he rules the children of men,  he holds Babylon in his own hand,  and leads the people whithersoever   he will. There are changes await-  ing us, they are even nigh at our  very doors, and I know it by the   revelations of Jesus Christ; I know  it by the visions of heaven; I know  it by the administrations of angels,   and I know it by the inspiration of  heaven, that is given to all men  who seek the Lord; and the hand of  God will not stay these things. We  have no time to lose.    I pray God's blessing upon the   men working on the temple, and  his blessing upon the Saints, that  their hearts may be inclined to build  them. If you knew and understood   the feelings of the Prophet Joseph  Smith, and those of his brethren as-  sociated with him, and the feelings  of the millions of the human family  who are shut up in their prison   houses we would not tire, we would   labor with all our might until the  building was finished and dedicated,  and then we would labor for the re-  demption of our dead. Ask Bishop  Hunter if he ever expects to meet  with his friends and associate with  those who have passed away, unless  he redeems them in the flesh, and  he will tell you, no. He could not  mingle with them if he did not re-  deem them in the flesh. I know the  same, too.    I pray God to bless you, and to   pour out his spirit upon my brethren  of the quorum of the Twelve, that   we may walk in the light and be   guided aright in all our ministra-  tions. And I tell you again, God   will not disappoint you; this king-  dom will never go backward, neither  will it ever be given into the hands  of another people; but it will rest  upon the shoulders of our sons and  daughters when Christ comes in the  clouds of heaven. We have no time  to throw away, or spend in the fool-  ish things of the flesh; what time   is at our disposal should be used in   building up the Zion of God, and in  preparing ourselves and our families  for the things that await us.  Oh, I   wish many times that the veil was  lifted from off the faces of the Lat-  ter-day Saints; I wish we could see  and know the things of God as they  do who are laboring for the salvation  of the human family who are in the  spirit world; for if this were so, this  whole people, with very few, if any,  exceptions, would lose all interest in  the riches of the world, and instead   thereof their whole desires and la-  bors would be directed to redeem   their dead, to perform faithfully the   work and mission given us on earth;   so that when we ourselves should   pass behind the veil and meet with  Joseph and the ancient apostles, and  others who are watching over us  and who are deeply interested in our   labors, we might feel satisfied in  having done our duty.    This is how I feel, this is my faith.  I read the Bible, the Book of Mor-  mon and the Book of Covenants,  and I look for everything contained  in them to be fulfilled. We are  making history day by day, and we   are fulfilling the events which the   old prophets saw, and which they   predicted would transpire in the  latter days. Isaiah, when he saw in   vision this people in the mountains,   exclaims:    "Sing, O heavens; and be joyful,   O earth; and break forth into sing-  ing, O mountains; for the Lord hath  comforted his people, and will have   mercy on his afflicted.    "But Zion said, The Lord hath for-  saken me, and my Lord hath for-  gotten me.    "Can a woman forget her sucking   child, that she could not have com-  passion on the son of her womb?   yea, they may forget, yet will I not  forget thee." [##Isaiah 49:13-15##]    In the own due time of the Lord  all things spoken by the prophets  will be literally fulfilled.    I pray God to help us to do our  duty and to help us to feel interested  in our labors in the flesh.  And as a  closing remark, seeing that this is  election time, I will say, do not, my  brethren, allow the spirit of conten-  tion and dissension to creep in among  you. I am ashamed of some of our  people who, instead of using their  powers and influence in endeavoring   to unite the people, go to work and   stir up strife, and the result is that   in some of our cities an opposition  ticket is gotten up, and our own peo-  ple in these places divide one against  the other. I say, shame on the   elder or man holding the priesthood,   the authority delegated to him by  high heaven, who will do this thing;  the heavens are displeased with such   a man, and unless he repents he will  certainly be found numbered with  those who are arrayed against God   and his kingdom in the earth. We  have the whole world against us,   besides many evil spirits to contend  with, and we certainly should not   divide one against another.    May God bless Israel, is my prayer,   through Jesus Christ. Amen.

 DISCOURSE  BY  Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF,  DELIVERED  At the Semi-Annual Conference, in  the New Tabernacle, Salt  Lake City, Oct. 8, 1873.    REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.    I AM called upon to occupy a little   time this morning, and I realize   that I and my brethren are all de-  pendent upon the Spirit of God to   guide, dictate and direct us in all   our public teachings, as well as in   all other acts we are called upon to   perform in the kingdom of God.   The apostle says there is no pro-  phecy of the Scripture which is of   any private interpretation, but  holy men of old spoke as they were   moved upon by the Holy Ghost.   The Lord has told us in some of  the revelations which he has given   in our day that all of his messen-  gers or servants, his Elders who are   sent forth to teach, should speak as  they are moved upon by the Holy   Ghost; and when they follow this   counsel what they say, the Lord   says, is Scripture, it is the mind   and will of the Lord, it is the word  of the Lord and it is the power of  God unto salvation. "And this is   an ensample unto you, even all my   servants who go forth to declare   the words of life unto the inhabi-  tants of the earth."    Again, the Lord has said that it   matters not whether it be by my   own voice out of the heavens,   whether it be by the administer-  ing of angels, or whether it be by  the voice of my servants, it is all  the same, and their words shall be  fulfilled though the heavens and   the earth pass away. This is the  position which the prophets, apos-  tles and patriarchs have occupied  upon the earth in every age and   dispensation. They have had to   be governed by the Spirit of God;   and when men are sent with a mes-  sage, and they speak as they are  moved upon by the Holy Ghost,  their words are the words of the   Lord and they will be fulfilled.    We have had a good deal of teach-  ing during this Conference from   the servants of God, teachings   given by the inspiration of the  Holy Ghost. We occupy a very   peculiar position on the earth, a  position differing in many respects   from any other dispensation to   men. Paul says—"Though we or   an angel from heaven preach unto   you any other gospel than that  which we have preached, let him   be accursed." All the teachings of   the patriarchs and prophets have  shown us but one gospel. There is   but one gospel, there never was but   one and there never will be. The   gospel revealed for the salvation of man  is the same in every age of the  world. Adam, our first great pro-  genitor and father, after the fall,  received this gospel, and he received   the holy priesthood in all its power,   and its keys and ordinances. He   sealed these blessings upon his sons  —Seth, Enos, Jared, Cainan, Ma-  haleel, Enoch and Methusaleh. All   these men received this high and  holy priesthood. They all professed  to give revelation. They all had   inspiration and left their record   on the earth; and not one of them but   what saw and prophecied about the  great Zion of God in the latter-days.  And when we say this of them  we say it of every apostle and pro-  phet who ever lived upon the earth.  Their revelations and prophecies all  point to our day and that great  kingdom of God which was spoken   of by Daniel, that great Zion of   God spoken of by Isaiah and Jere-  miah; and that great gathering of  the house of Israel spoken of by   Ezekiel and Malachi and many of   the ancient patriarchs and pro-  phets.    When the Lord has attempted to   perform a work on the earth there  has been one peculiarity with him,   and that is, the instruments which   he has made use of have occupied   a peculiar position in the world.   He has generally chosen the weak  things of the world to confound   the wise, and things that were   nought to bring to pass things  which were. When he wanted a   man to deliver Israel, he called Mo-  ses, who was in an ark of bulrushes  among the crocodiles and aligators  of the river Nile, put there by his   mother, a Hebrew woman, because   Moses was her first born, and all  the first born of the Hebrews had to   be slain. The daughter of Pharaoh,   through the providence of God,  preserved Moses, and by her he was   given to his mother to raise. When    called to deliver Israel, Moses told  the Lord that he was a man slow   of speech. He did not feel qualified  to perform so great a work, yet the  Lord chose him, and he performed   the work the Lord assigned him.    So when the Lord wanted a   king for Israel and the lot fell upon   the family of Jesse. The Prophet  went and called for the sons of Jess  to pick out this king. All the boys   were brought before him except  David. He was the smallest of the   flock, and was out taking care of   the sheep. Jesse never thought of  him at all. He brought his other  sons, who had been trained in all  the arts, sciences and learning of   the day, and when they came in   Samuel could not see the one he  wanted. He asked Jesse if he had   not any more sons. Yes, he had a  boy taking care of the sheep. "Let's   see him," said the prophet; and   when he came he was anointed   king.    Jesus himself was born in a stable  and cradled in a manger and travel-  ed in poverty all the way through   his life. When he chose his disciples   he did not take the great, learned,   rich and noble of that generation,  but he chose fishermen, the most   illiterate men and, in one sense of   the word, we may say, almost the   lowest calling among men in that  day. They were the ones the Lord   made use of to go forth to preach   his gospel and to build up his king-  dom on the earth.    How is it in our day, in this great   and last dispensation? The Lord   required an instrument who would  take hold and work with him. He   required some one to lay the found-  ation of this great church and king-  dom who would be willing to step   forth and be led in the channel that  was according to the mind and will  of God, a man who could not be  swayed by the traditions and relig-  ions of the day. Whom did the  Lord call? The patriarchs and pro-  phets not only pointed out the Zion   of God and the manner in which   his church and kingdom should be   established and built up, but they   even called the name of the man  who should be called to establish  this work, and I do not know but   the name of his father. His name  was to be Joseph and he was to be a   lineal descendant of ancient Joseph,  who was sold into Egypt, separated   from his brethren. The record or  stick of Joseph in the hand of   Ephraim, which Ezekiel speaks of,  which was to be put with the record   of the Jews in the last days, was to  be an instrument in the hands of   God of performing this great work  or laying the foundation of this  church, and the gathering of the   twelve tribes of the house of Israel.  In that record the man's name was   pointed out as well as the work he  was to do. Joseph Smith knew   nothing of all this until after he  was administered to by the angel of   God; he had no knowledge of this  when he brought forth that record  to the world, and until he translated  it, by the Urim and Thummim,   into the English language. He  had no knowledge whatever of this;  but here was that great band, as  strong as iron, that surrounded him   by the revelations of God, for the  last six thousand years, by every   man who spoke of the work of God   in the last days. These prophecies,   revelations, and decrees of the Al-  mighty, as it were, surrounded that  man, and he had to be taught, not  by man nor by the will of man, but  he required the angels of God to  come forth and teach him; it re-  quired the revelations of God to   teach him, and he was taught for  years by visions and revelations,   and by holy angels sent from God   out of heaven to teach and instruct  him and prepare him to lay   the foundation of this church.    As I before remarked, these pro-  phecies surrounded him, forming,   in one sense of the word, a band   and a power he could not get out of.  Why? Besause no prophecy of   Scripture is of any private interpre-  tation, but holy men of old spoke as  they were moved upon by the in-  spiration of the Holy Ghost, and   when any of those prophets and   patriarchs for the last six thousand   years spoke, when wrapped in pro-  phetic vision, of the Zion of God   being established in the last dispen-  sation, those decrees had to be ful-  filled to the very letter.    When Joseph Smith received   these revelations he was an illiter-  ate boy, like David among the   sheep. The Lord, in this day, did  not choose one from among the   great, mighty, rich or noble, but he  choose one prepared from before the  foundation of the world, to come   forth in the last days, through the   loins of ancient Joseph who, in the    hands of God, was the savior of the   house of Israel and of the Egypt-  ians in his day. This man was   raised up in his proper time, and   came forth into the world, and the   Lord began to feel after him and to  prepare him; but he, himself, did   not know even when he laid the  foundation of this work. The Lord  told him—"you will lay the found-  ation of a great work, but you know   it not." Joseph himself could not  comprehend, unless he was wrap-  ped in the visions of eternity, the   importance of the work the founda-  tion of which he had laid. When   his mind was opened he could un-  derstand, in many respects, the de-  signs of God; and these revelations   were around him and they guided   his footsteps. They could not fail  of fulfillment, they had to be ac-  complished in the earth. The ser-  vant of God came forth and he re-  ceived the Book of Mormon—the   record or stick of Joseph in the   hands of Ephraim. He brought  forth that record according to the   dictation of Moroni, Nephi and  Lehi, the angels of God who admin-  istered to him, and he translated it  into the English language. before   he laid the foundation of this   church. Joseph Smith did not call   upon any man to ordain or to bap-  tize him, but he waited until the  Lord sent forth his servants to ad-  minister unto him. He was com-  manded of the Lord to go forth and  be baptized, but not until he had   received the priesthood. Where did   he get it, and in fact what is the   priesthood? It is the authority of   God in heaven to the sons of men to   administer in any of the ordinances  of his house. There never was a   man and never will be a man, in   this or any other age of the world,   who has power and authority to ad-  minister in one of the ordinances of   the house of God, unless he is call-  ed of God as was Aaron, unless he   has the holy priesthood and is ad-  ministered to by those holding that  authority.    There was no man on the face of  the earth, nor had not been for the   last seventeen centuries, who had   power and authority from God to go  forth and administer in one of the  ordinances of the house of God.   What did he do then? Why, the   Lord sent unto him John the Bap-  tist, who, when upon the earth, held   the Aaronic priesthood, who was   beheaded for the word of God and  the testimony of Jesus Christ. He   laid his hands upon the head of  Joseph Smith and ordained him to  the Aaronic priesthood, and he never  attempted to act in any authority of  the gospel until he received this   priesthood. Joseph was then qual-  ified to baptize for the remission of   sins, but he had not the authority   to lay on hands for the reception of  the Holy Ghost, and he never at-  tempted to administer in this ordi-  nance until Peter, James and John,   two of whom—Peter and James—  were also martyred for the testimo-  ny of Jesus and the word of God.   These three men were the last who   held the keys of the Apostleship in  its fullness and power previous to  this dispensation. They laid their   hands upon the head of Joseph   Smith, and sealed upon him every   power, principle, ordinance and key   belonging to the Apostleship, and   until he received this ordination he   was not qualified and had no right  to administer in the ordinances of  the house of God, but he did this   after he received the priesthood, and   on the 6th day of april, 1830, he or-  ganized this church with six mem-  bers, which was the foundation of   what we see to-day in this taberna-  cle, and for six hundred miles   through this American desert. This  has all come from that small seed—  the foundation of the great king-  dom of our God upon the earth.    What did Joseph Smith do after  having received this priesthood and  its ordinances? I will tell you what   he did. He did that which seven-  teen centuries and fifty generations,  that have passed and gone, of all   the clergy and religions of Chris-  tendom, and the whole world com-  bined were not able to do—he, al-  though an illiterate youth, present-  ed to the world the Gospel of Jesus   Christ in its fullness, plainness and   simplicity, as taught by its Author   and his apostles; he presented the   church of Jesus Christ and the  kingdom of God perfect in their or-  ganization, as Paul represents them  —with head and feet, arms and   hands, every member of the body  perfect before heaven and earth.  How could he, an illiterate boy, do  that which the whole of the learn-  ing of the Christian world for seve  nteen centuries failed to do? Be-  cause he was moved upon by the   power of God, he was instructed by   those men who, when in the flesh,   had preached the same gospel them-  selves, and in doing this he fulfilled   that which Father Adam, Enoch,   Moses, Elias, Isaiah, Jeremiah and   Jesus and his apostles all prophecied  about. Well might Paul say—"I   am not ashamed of the gospel of  Christ, for it is the power of God  unto salvation unto every one that  believes." So may the Latter-day   Saints say—"We are not ashamed   of the gospel of Christ." I am not  ashamed to say that Joseph Smith  was a prophet of God; I am not   ashamed to bear record that he was   called of God, and laid the founda-  tion of this church and kingdom on  the earth, for this is true, and any  man or woman who is inspired by   the Holy Ghost can see and under-  stand these things.    My brethren and sisters and   friends, here is laid the foundation   of the fulfillment of that mighty  flood of prophecy delivered since   the days of Father Adam down   to the last prophet who breathed the   breath of life. There has been more  prophecy fulfilled in the last forty-  three years upon the face of the   earth, than in two thousand years   before. These mighty prophecies,   as I said before, like a band of iron,   governed and controlled Joseph   Smith in his labors while he lived  on the earth. He lived until he   received every key, ordinance and  law ever given to any may on the  earth, from Father Adam down,   touching this dispensation. He re-  ceived powers and keys from under   the hands of Moses for gathering   the house of Israel in the last days;   he received under the hands of Elias   the keys of sealing the hearts of the   fathers to the children and the hearts   of the children to the fathers; he   received under the hands of Peter,  James and John the apostleship,   and everything belonging thereto;   he received under the hands of  Moroni all the keys and powers re-  quired of the stick of Joseph in the   hands of Ephraim; he received   under the hand of John the Bap-  tist the Aaronic priesthood, with   all its keys and powers, and every  other key and power belonging to   this dispensation, and I am not   ashamed to say that he was a pro-  phet of God, and he laid the founda-  tion of the greatest work and dis-  pensation that has ever been estab-  lished on the earth.    Joseph Smith lived until he gave   his testament to the world, and   when he had sealed all these keys,  powers and blessings upon the head  of Brigham Young and his breth-  ren; when he had planted these   keys on the earth so that they   should be removed no more forever;  when he had done this, and brought   forth that record, that book of rev-  alation, the proclamation of which  involved the destiny of this whole   generation—Jew, Gentile, Zion and   Babylon, all the nations of the   earth, he sealed that testimony with  his blood in Carthage jail, where   his life and that of his brother Hy-  rum were taken by the hands of   wicked and ungodly men. Why  was his life taken? Why were not  John Taylor and Willard Richards,  the only two of the Twelve at that  time in Nauvoo and with him, also   sacrificed? Why did Willard   Richards, the largest man in the   prison, stand in the midst of that  shower of balls and escape without   a hole in his robe or garment, or   clothing? Because these things  were all governed and controlled by  the revelations of God and the word   of the Lord. The Lord took whom  he would take and he preserved   whom he would preserve, and he   has done this all the way through.   Why has Brigham Young been   preserved, when he has stood as  much chance to lay down his life in  defence of this cause, and run as  many dangers in one position and  another as anybody else? Because   the Lord has had a hand and a   meaning in this, and he has pre-  served him for a certain purpose,   and other men have been preserved   by the same power. The whole of   it has been the work of God on the   earth. The revelations of God have   surrounded Brigham Young. The   revelations of God in ancient days   affect him and the apostles, and the   elders of Israel, as much as they   have affected any people in any   generation.    I will speak of another branch of   this subject. We have the king-  dom organized, the prophecies have   been fulfilled, the church has been   planted in the earth, and now there  are other portions of these revela-  tions which must be fulfilled. We   were settled in Jackson County,   Clay County, Caldwell County, in   Kirtland and finally in Nauvoo.  We were driven from one place to   another until we settled Nauvoo,  and at last we were driven from   Nauvoo into the wilderness and to   this land, led here by President   Brigham Young under the inspira-  tion of Almighty God. Some felt   their faith tried that we had to leave  our lovely Nauvoo and go into the   wilderness. Bless your souls, there  would have been a flood of revela-  tion unfulfilled if these things had  not been so. Isaiah speaks of the   foundation of this great Zion, and   writes the whole of her history and   travels up to the present day, and   from this time on until the winding  up scene. If we had not been driven  from Nauvoo we would never have  come up the Platte river, where,   Isaiah says, he saw the Saints going   by the river of water wherein went   no galley with oars; a great compa-  ny of women with child and her that  travailed with child would   never have come here to the moun-  tains of Israel if we had not been   driven from that land, and a whole   flood of prophecy would have re-  mained unfulfilled, with regard to   our making this desert blossom   as the rose, the waters coming forth  out of the barren desert, our building   the house of God on the tops of the   mountains, lifting up a standard   for these nations to flee to; all this  and much more would have remain-  ed unfulfilled had we not been guid-  ed and led by the strong arm of Je-  hovah, whose words must be ful-  filled though the heavens and the   earth pass away.    Having been brought to Zion an-  other subject presents itself to our  consideration—namely, the position  which President Young occupies in  regard to us to-day. He calls upon  us to build temples, cities, towns  and villages, and to do a great deal  of temporal work. Strangers and  the Christian world marvel at the  "Mormons" talking about temporal  things. Bless your souls, two thirds  of all the revelations given in this  world rest upon the accomplish-  ment of this temporal work. We  have it to do, we can't build up Zi-  on sitting on a hemlock slab sing-  ing ourselves away to everlasting  bliss; we have to cultivate the earth,  to take the rocks and elements out  of the mountains and rear temples  to the Most High God; and this  temporal work is demanded at our  hands by the God of heaven, as  much as he require Christ to die  to redeem the world, or as much as  the Savior required Peter, James  and John to go and preach the gos-  pel to the nations of the earth. This  is the great dispensation in which  the Zion of God must be built up,  and we as Latter-day Saints have it  to build. People think it strange be-  cause so much is said with regard to   this. I will tell you Latter-day  Saints, and the Christian world too,  our work will fall short, we will  come short of our duties, and we  never shall perform the work that  God Almighty has decreed we  shall perform unless we enter into  these temporal things. We are   obliged to build cities, town and   villages, and we are obliged to gath-  er the people from every nation  under heaven to the Zion of God,  that they may be taught in the  ways of the Lord. We have only  just begun to prepare for the celes-  tial law when we are baptized into  the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-  ter-day Saints.    There has been a good deal said   here with regard to baptism for the   dead. When Joseph Smith had   laid the foundation of this work he   was taken away. There are good   reasons why it was so. Jesus sealed  his testimony with his blood. Joseph   Smith did the same, and from the   day he died his testimony has been   in force upon the whole world. He   has gone into the spirit world and   organized this dispensation on that   side of the vail; he is gathering to-  gether the elders of Israel and the   Saints of God in the spirit world,   for they have a work to do there as   well as here. Joseph and Hyrum   Smith, Father Smith, David Patten   and the other elders who have been   called to the other side of the vail  have fifty times as many people to   preach to as we have on the earth.   There they have all the spirits who   have lived on the earth in seven-  teen centuries—fifty generations,   fifty thousand millions of persons   who lived and died here without   having seen a prophet or apostle,   and without having the word of the  Lord sent unto them. They are   shut up in prison, awaiting the mes-  sage of the elders of Israel. We  have only about a thousand mil-  lions of people on the earth, but in   the spirit world they have fifty thou-  sand millions; and there is not a sin-  gle revelation which gives us any   reason to believe that any man who

 who assemble to be taught. Every  man in the Church of God on the  earth should be able to speak as he  is moved upon by the Holy Ghost.  Then his words are the word of the  Lord, the mind of the Lord, the  will of the Lord, and they are  scripture.    Of all people that have ever lived,  the Latter-day Saints have the  greatest reason to be thankful to the  Lord. We possess the fulness of the  Gospel and are members of the  Church of Jesus Christ. We oc-  cupy a place in that land which  was given to Joseph by his father—  the land of America. [##2 Nephi 3:3-5##] We have re-  ceived the organization of the great  Kingdom of our God—that king-  dom which was spoken of by Adam,  by Daniel, and by all the ancient  prophets whose eyes have been upon  this age of the world. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] We are  building up Zion in the very place  and on the very continent which  the Lord designed. Therefore, why  should we not be happy? Why  should we not be contented? Why  should we not be united together to  carry out the purposes of the Lord?  We should be. There is no man  who has received this Gospel and  enjoys the Holy Ghost but can re-  joice and be thankful, and be wil-  ling to pass through whatever trials  or afflictions he may be called upon  to endure for the Gospel's sake. I  feel to rejoice myself at this time  that we have the privilege of meet-  ing together in peace. When I con-  template our position as Lat-  ter-day Saints, and the re-  sponsibilities that we are under,  I feel that our hearts and our souls  should be drawn out in thanksgiv-  ing to God. We should labor for  the building up of the Kingdom of  God and for the establishment of  His work; for we have been called  of God and appointed to take this  kingdom in the latter days and bear  it off. We have promises given  unto us that no other dispensation  or generation of men ever had. It  has been promised us that we shall  possess the kingdom and the great-  ness of the kingdom, and it will  never be overthrown, but will re-  main until Jesus Christ, the great  lawgiver to Israel, comes to reign  over His people. Therefore, we  need not think that we have noth-  ing to do. We have a great work  before us, and it will require all our  exertions and all our talents and  ability to perform it. We must seek  for the Spirit of God to assist us;  for without this Spirit we can ac-  complish but very little.    There is a subject pressing upon  my mind at the present time which  I want to speak upon. I refer to the  treatment of animals. My soul has  been pained a great deal by the  treatment which man extends to the  beasts of the field. Before the  railroad was built across this conti-  nent I crossed the plains several  times, and the abuse of animals  which I then witnessed gave me  great pain. The Lord has given  unto us horses and cattle and other  animals for our benefit. Not one of  these animals can talk to us, and I  therefore look upon their ill-treat-  ment as a great evil and a sin. This  is a matter which the world consider    of small consequence for the Presi-  dent of a church to talk about. I  have not done it heretofore, but I  am going to do it now.    We all admire a fine horse. It is  one of the noblest of animals. It is  also one of the most useful of ani-  mals. The treatment that we ex-  tend to horses, in many instances, is  unjust and unrighteous. I have seen  men take a young horse that had  never had a harness on. They have  harnessed it, and they have taken  a black-snake whip, and before it  was ever put to a wagon or any-  thing of the kind they have whipped  it almost to death. I have seen  young men in these valleys do that.  Does that horse know why he is thus  abused? The man who does this  commits a sin. When you harness  a young horse for the first time, he  knows nothing about it and does not  know what to do. That horse should  be treated kindly, no matter whether  he kicks, or jumps, or bites. He  don't understand why that harness  is put on him, and the man who has  any kindness about him will treat  that animal kindly. If you do this,  the horse will very soon learn what  you want of him, and when he learns  that, he will do it. Treat your ani-  mals kindly and they will treat you  kindly; they will do all you ask of  them.    Here is a young heifer. She has  a calf. A youug man goes to milk  her. She has never been milked  before. She kicks and won't stand  still. What does that young man  do? He gets a club or something of  the kind and goes to thrashing her.  Now, whoever does that ought to  be thrashed himself. Treat that  animal kindly. In a little while  she will understand what is wanted  of her and will then act all right.    I want to see a change, especially  with the Latter-day Saints, in their  treatment of the beasts of the field.  They have been given to us for our  use. They are a great blessing to  us, and we should treat them gent-  ly and with consideration. It is  wrong to exercise tyranny over  anything. When I was a boy and  went to school, the schoolmaster  used to come with a bundle of sticks  about eight feet long, and one of the  first things we expected was to get a  whipping. For anything that  was not pleasing to him we  would get a terrible thrashing.  What whipping I got then did not  do me any good. I have always  felt that ill-treatment either of chil-  dren or animals is all wrong. Kind-  ness, gentleness and mercy are bet-  ter every way. I would like this  principle instilled into the minds of  our young men, that they may  carry it out in all their acts in life.  Tyranny is not good, whether it be  exercised by kings, by presidents,  or by the servants of God. Kind  words are far better than harsh  words. If, when we have diffi-  culties one with another, we would  be kind and affable to each other, we  would save ourselves a great deal of  trouble.    I wonder if there is a man here  who ever gained anything by scold-  ing or beating his wife or his chil-  dren. I never saw auy good result  from it. You go into a family where    a man treats his wife and children  kindly, and you will find that they  will treat him in the same way.  Complaints reach me of the treat-  ment of men to their wives. They  do not provide for them. They  do not treat them kindly. All this  pains me. These things should not  be. Here is a man who has a wife  or wives. They have been given  unto him of the Lord. They have  placed themselves under his direc-  tion. This man is held responsible  by his Creator for the course which  he pursues toward these women.  He should be kind to them; and in  their afflictiou he should not tyran-  nize over them, or scold them, or  pain their hearts. We should be  kind to one another, do good to one  another, and labor to promote the  welfare, the interest and the happi-  ness of each other, especially those  of our own households. The man  stands at the head of the family.  He is the patriarch of his house-  hold. I have attended meetings in  this Church where one man has had  almost a congregation of sons and  daughters. There is no more beauti-  ful sight on earth than to see a  man stand at the head of his family  and teach them righteous principles  and give them good counsel. These  children honor their father, and  they take consolation and joy in  having a father who is a righteous  man.    Our sisters, also, have their duties  to perform to their husbands. They  should consider his position and his  circumstances. Many of our breth-  ren have gone to prison, for the Gos-  pel's sake. This has created a degree  of trial, affliction and sorrow in their  families. As a general thing, as  Brother George Q. Cannon has said,  it has a tendency to draw their  wives and their children closer to  them. Every wife should be kind  to her husband. She should com-  fort him and do what good she can  for him, under all circumstances in  life. When all the family are united  together, they enjoy a heavenly  spirit here on the earth. This is  how it should be; for when a man  in this Church takes unto himself a  wife he expects to remain with her  through all time and eternity. In  the morning of the first resurrection  he expects to have that wife and his  children with him in a family or-  ganization, to remain in that condi-  tion forever and forever. What a  glorious thought that is! I have felt  if, when I get through this world,  where I have passed through many  tribulations and afflictions with my  wives and children, I can only have  them with me in the next world, in  their immortal bodies, to stand with  me in the presence of God and of the  Savior, and ofthe patriarchs and  prophets, it will pay me for all my  labors if I should live to be as old as  Methusaleh. And I have no doubt  that all of you feel the same.    There is another thing I wish to  refer to here. I have heard that in  Zion there are some men who enter-  tain the idea that they inherit the  body and spirit of Moses, or Abraham (OT)Abra-  ham, or David, or Noah, or some-  body other than themselves. I hope  none of you here indulge in any-  thing of this kind, because it is a 
 remaining, and I this day have been  called to this responsibility in the  midst of my brethren — a responsi-  bility that no man can fill unless he  is inspired o[f] God.    But I will say this to my brethren   and sisters, in the name of Israel's   God: The Almighty will never per-  mit me, nor any other President  who holds the keys of the Kingdom  of God, to lead you astray. If I do   not walk in the paths of righteous-  ness and do what is right in the  position that I occupy, He will re-  move me out of my place, or any  other man who attempts to lead the  people astray. The position which   I occupy, and that occupied by my  brethren the Apostles, should not   have a tendency, if we have the   Spirit of God, to make us lifted up  or exalted in our spirits before the   Lord.  I know, as the God of Israel   lives, that I have no power, nor  have I had, in this Church, to   perform any work pertaining to this  Kingdom until it has been given  unto me by the God of heaven. I  know Joseph Smith had not, nor  Brigham Young, nor John Taylor,  nor any Apostle or Elder in this   Church and Kingdom. And the mo-  ment that I attempt to become lifted  up in the pride of my heart, because  of any position that I hold, that  moment I become a very unwise   man. So with anyone else. The  higher our position the more our re-  sponsibility. During the little time   I may spend here in the flesh, I   stand in need of the prayers of the  Latter-day Saints, of those who   have faith in God. So do my  brethren that surround me. So do  all the authorities of the Church.  We all stand in need of the Holy  Ghost and the power of God. With-  out this we are not qualified to  fill the positions which we are called  to occupy.    I know that this is the work of  God. So do all you who have ever  had the testimony of the Holy   Ghost with you. The God of heaven   has set His hand to establish His   Kingdom, in fulfillment of the   revelations of heaven which He   has inspired men to declare and put   on record from generation to gener-  ation. His hand has been manifest   from the beginning of the work  until the present day. It will be  until this scene is wound up. I  have a great desire that, as a peo-  ple, we may be united in heart; that  we may have faith in the revela-  tions of God, and look to those   hings which have been promised   unto us. We should be hum-  ble before the Lord.  Trace the   history of Jesus Christ, the Savior of  the world, from the manger to the  cross, onward through sufferings,   mingled with blood, to the throne  of grace, and there is an ensample  for the Elders of Israel, an ensample  for all those who follow the Lord   Jesus Christ. In meekness and low-  liness of heart He labored faithfully  while He dwelt in the flesh to carry  out the will of His Father. God has  laid upon our shoulders and has  sealed upon our heads the holy and   eternal Priesthood, which is from   eternity unto eternity. Without  that Priesthood we have no power  to administer in the ordinances of  the Gospel of Christ, either for the  living or the dead. But with that  Priesthood we have power to per-  form the work that is assigned unto   s. By that Priesthood we have  preached the Gospel, we have ad-  ministered in the ordinances of the   House of the Lord, and we have  gathered together the sons and  daughters of Zion into these valleys  of the mountains.    I feel as though I want to bear my   testimony to the truth of this good   old book, the Bible, for a few min-  utes—the book that all the Chris-  tian world profess to believe in.  There is an effort made today by the  infidel and unbelieving world to   ridicule the Bible, as not being the  word of the Lord. I will refer to a   few things that have been manifes-  ted in fulfillment of the record. To  commence with, I will touch upon   the first dealings of God with man.   The first son that was begotten by  Father Adam, whose name was  Cain, proved to be a murderer. He  slew his brother Abel, who held the   Priesthood, and the Lord pro-  nounced a curse upon him. He   showed Cain the position he was in,  and told him what the result of his  crime would be; and Cain said unto  the Lord:    "My punishment is greater than   I can bear.    "Behold, Thou has driven me out   this day from the face of the earth;  and from thy face shall I be hid;  and I shall be a fugitive and a vag-  abond in the earth; and it shall   come to pass, that every one that   findeth me shall slay me."    But the Lord said unto him:    "Therefore, whosoever slayeth   Cain, vengeance shall be taken on  him seven fold. And the Lord set a   mark upon Cain, lest any finding   him should kill him."    What was that mark? It was a   mark of blackness. That mark   rested upon Cain and descended   upon his posterity from that time  until the present. Today there are  millions of the descendants of Cain,   through the lineage of Ham, in the   world, and that mark of darkness   still rests upon them. Though  nearly six thousand years have   passed and gone, this mark is visi-  ble to the whole human family.   Yet the fool and the infidel say  there is no God, and they ridicule   the Bible.    The Lamanites, on this continent,  suffered a similar experience. They  went to war against the Nephites;   they thirsted for blood, and they  painted themselves red; and the   Lord put a curse of redness upon   them. Hundreds of years have  passed since then, but wherever   you meet the Lamanites today, you   see that mark upon them.    Read the history of ancient na-  tions and the dealings of God with  them, as contained in the Bible and  other historical works. When those   ancient kingdoms and peoples be-  came wicked and corrupt, when  they turned away from all that was  virtuous and holy, the Lord raised   up prophets to warn them; and these   prophets, though perhaps unpopu-  lar in the eyes of those with whom   they dwelt, warned these nations  and cities of the judgments that   would overtake them. What fol-  lowed the warnings of these proph-  ets? Read of the fall of the mighty  cities of Thebes, Nineveh, Memphis,   Tyre and Sidon, Babylon the Great,   and Jerusalem itself. All these  great and mighty cities and nations  were warned by the servants of   God of the judgments that would  overtake them. Did the inhabitants   of those cities believe the words of   the prophets? They did not. But  did those words come to pass? They  did; and those cities were laid waste  and their inhabitants destroyed.  Thus the words of the prophets and  inspired men were fulfilled to the   very letter, not one jot or tittle fail-  ing unfulfilled. And yet the infidel   says there is no God. These same  prophets and patriarchs also saw, by  vision and revelation, our day; they   pointed out the generation in which   we live, and they all declared that,  in the latter days, the God of heaven   would set His hand to gather to-  gether His people and establish His   kingdom. The Revelator St. John   also declared what should come to  pass in the latter days. In the 14th  chapter of Revelation he says:    "And I looked, and lo, a Lamb  stood on the mount Zion, and with  Him an hundred forty and four   thousand, having His Father's   name written in their foreheads.    These one hundred and forty-four   thousand were sealed out of all the 
 226  THE DESERET WEEKLY.    Are we, as parents, doing our duty   towards them? Are they trying to   qualify themselves and preparing  for the great destiny and work  which lie before them? I think  they are, to a certain extent. But   when I see any of these young men   going astray and going to these  saloons, drinking and smoking,   instead of going to Sabbath School   and to meeting to qualify them-  selves, I feel sorry. I would regret  to see any son or daughter of mine  or of my neighbors going astray,  because they would be losing great   glory, and depriving themselves of  the privilege of stepping forth and  taking the place of their fathers and  of the prophets and apostles of God,  and filling the different quorums of  the Church. They would be losing   that which they do not comprehend.   When, however, I hear a testimony  like that given here today concern-  ing our young people, it gives me   joy and consolation.    I feel that it is our duty to do all   that we can in behalf of these insti-  tutions in our midst. It is the duty   of the presidents, the superintend-  ents and the teachers to do all they   can to influence our sons and  daughters to unite together and to  qualify themselves by learning out  of good books. They should be  taught to seek for the Spirit of God   and to treasure up wisdom, and to  obtain those principles of power  which they will need in the day   when the judgments of God shall   descend upon the earth. I rejoice   when I see our young men and  maidens trying to do their duty.   The Lord is raising up young men   who are being clothed upon with the   Spirit and power of God. I rejoice   in this. I am satisfied that they  will increase; but I feel that they   should be taught and encouraged to  qualify themselves to take the  Kingdom of God and bear it off.    There is a great destiny awaiting  our young men. Therefore, they  ought to be temperate; not drink  whiskey, not chew or smoke tobacco,  and not mingle with the drunken.  And it is the duty of those who are   not married to take these daughters  of Zion to wife, when they arrive at  a proper age. There are no better  women on the face of the earth than  those that dwell in these mountains  of Israel. If there is any virtue   anywhere, it exists among the   women that live in Zion. The same   with the men. Our young ladies   are virtuous; their mothers are   virtuous; and their fathers are  virtuous. There may be exceptions;   but the Lord has gathered together  a people who are virtuous. My feel-  ings are that every young man in   Israel should get married when he  arrives at a proper age. It does not   cost any man more to provide these  girls with food and clothing after they   are married than it does before. It  does not cost any more for your-  selves. But you are then prepared  to begin to gather some means  around you. Do not wait until you  have about ten thousand dollars and   have fine horses and carriages. You   will get them just as quickly after you  are married, and possibly quicker,   than you will before.    It is our duty to get married at   the proper time. It is the law of   God. Therefore, I would like to see   you young men take these daugh-  ters of Zion to wife. Look at the  posterity of Abraham, Isaac and   Jacob, and see how they spread   throughout the whole world. The  tribe of Judah has remained until  this day; but had they not been of   the seed of Abraham, Isaac and   Jacob, and had they not been   blessed by father Jacob, they would   doubtless have been destroyed long  before this. The Jews put to death  the Savior and His Apostles, and  had they not been of the chosen   seed they would never have been al-  lowed to remain on the earth; but  they have remained almost undi-  minished, in the midst of all the   persecution and tribulation which  they have had to suffer.    These are some of my feelings,  brethren and sisters, with regard to  our young men and maidens.  They occupy a position, as  I have often said, that   no previous generation ever occu-  pied. Many of these young men   and maidens that are here today   will, in my opinion, if they are   faithful, stand in the flesh when  Christ comes in the clouds of   heaven. These young people from   the Sabbath Schools and from the  Mutual Improvement Associations,   will stand in the flesh while the   judgments of the Almighty sweep  the nations of the earth as with a  besom of destruction, in fulfillment   of the revelations of God, and they   will be the very people whom God  will bless and sustain. Therefore, I   say, our young men cannot begin   too quickly to qualify themselves by  treasuring up wisdom and calling   upon God and getting the Holy   Priesthood; for they have got to  stand in holy places while these  judgments are poured out upon the  earth. The nations of the earth are   rejecting the testimony which we  bear; they are rejecting the Gospel   of Christ; and these judgments of   God, like a few drops of rain before  the shower, are beginning to de-  scend upon the earth. We hear of  floods, of fires, of earthquakes. These   are only the beginning of sorrows.   These judgments will increase, and  they will continue to increase until   all that has been predicted by the   prophets of God will come to pass  upon the earth.    Now, brethren and sisters, we are  trying to prepare ourselves for ex-  altation and eternal life. We have  received the Holy Priesthood.   There is no change to that Priest-  hood. It belongs to the Celestial  Kingdom of our God. It does not  belong to the terrestrial nor to the  telestial kingdom. If you and I  ever get into the celestial kingdom,   we have got to keep the law of that   kingdom. Show me the law that a  man keeps and I will tell you where   he is going. We, as Latter-day   Saints, have everything to encour-  age us. We have received the Gos-  pel of Christ and the blessings  thereof. What did we know in re-  gard to God and salvation until the  Lord revealed Himself? Who ever knew,   before the Lord revealed it   to us, that a man could have his   wives and his children with him in  the morning of the resurrection, in  the family organization, with him-  self at the head, to dwell together  for ever and ever? I have thought   many a time that if I labored until  I was as old as Methuselah and by  that means could have my family   dwell with me in glory in the eter-  nal worlds, it would pay me for all  the pain and suffering I could en-  dure in this world. And this is   only one of the blessings that are   promised unto us.    Our young people should labor to   qualify themselves by reading the  revelations of God. There is no  time to waste in reading novels.   Read the Bible, the Book of Mor-  mon, the Doctrine and Covenants  and the records which the Lord has   given unto us, and treasure up these  revelations and see what the Lord  has promised unto us. We then   treasure up something of worth to   us. At one of our meetings a short   time ago President Cannon read the   revelation contained in the Doctrine   and Covenants with regard to what  the Lord said to Orson Hyde, Wm.   E. McLellin and other Elders going  out to preach. The Lord said, speak-  ing through Joseph Smith:    "And whatsoever they shall speak  when moved upon by the Holy   Ghost, shall be scripture, shall be  the will of the Lord, shall be the  mind of the Lord, shall be the word  of the Lord, shall be the voice of  the Lord, and the power of God un-  to salvation." [##Doctrine and Covenants 68:4##]    Why is this? Because the Holy  Ghost is one of the Godhead, and   consequently when a man speaks  by the Holy Ghost, it is the word   of the Lord. We should seek to ob-  tain this Spirit that it may be with  us all the time and become a princi-  ple of revelation to us. It is the  right of every man in the Church  to enjoy the presence of the Holy  Ghost.    Brethren and sisters, we are liv-  ing in a fast age, and we have no  time to waste. This is a time when   the Lord is going to cut His work  short in righteousness. I have a   desire that we, as a people, shall un-  derstand the position that we occu-  py before the Lord. In the 121st   section of the Doctrine and Cove-  nants, the Lord, in speaking to  Joseph Smith while in Liberty Jail, says:    "Behold, there are many called,  but few are chosen. And why are   they not chosen?    "Because their hearts are set so   much upon the things of this world,   and aspire to the honors of men, that  they do not learn this one lesson—    "That the rights of the Priesthood  are inseparably connected with the  powers of heaven, and that the  powers of heaven cannot be con-  trolled nor handled only upon the  principles of righteousness." [##Doctrine and Covenants 121:34-36##]    In Kirtland, a number of the  Quorum of the Twelve Apostles  apostatized. Why did they aposta-  tize? Because they forsook the Lord,  they stopped praying, they wanted   to get rich, they sought for the  honors of men and for the riches of  the world; and notwithstanding 
 DISCOURSE  Delivered by President Wilford   Woodruff, at the Quarterly Con-  ference of the Salt Lake Stake,  Salt Lake City, September 1, 1889.     REPORTED BY GEORGE F. GIBBS.    I feel thankful that I have the  privilege of assembling in this Tab-  ernacle with my friends, the Latter-  day Saints, to partake of the Lord's  supper, the emblems of His body  and blood, His body which was  broken for us and His blood which  was shed for us. I regard this as a   great privilege. While meeting   with the Saints upon occasions of   this kind I often reflect upon their  spiritual condition, and hope and   pray that those who of us who are thus   favored to commemorate the death  and sufferings of our Lord and Sa-  vior by partaking of the Sacrament,  may so live that we may be worthy   to eat and drink with Him at the  great marriage supper of the Lamb,  in company with the prophets and  patriarchs and Saints of God of form-  er and latter days whom the Father   hath given unto Him—those who   have obeyed the law, received the  truths of the Gospel and kept His   commandments.    I wish to say to the Latter-day   Saints that every man holding the   holy Priesthood, every man called   to preside over the Church or any   branch of it, is dependent upon the  Lord for His Holy Spirit to guide   and sustain him. We have found   the exhortation of the Savior to the  apostles of His day applicable to our  own labors and experience, wherein  He said, "And when they bring   you unto the synagogues, and unto  magistrates, and powers, take no  thought how or what ye shall   answer, or what ye shall say: for   the Holy Ghost shall teach you in  the same hour what ye ought to  say." [##Luke 12:11-12##] We differ from many people  in this regard. We very often call   upon the Elders from among the   congregation to come to the stand  to speak without any preparation.   We all, in a measure, occupy this   same position before our fellow men.  I never know when appearing   before an assembly of the Saints  what I may say to them; I leave  entirely all these matters with the   Lord. If the Lord gives me noth-  ing, I shall certainly have but very  little to say to the people. And this   is the position that the Elders are   placed in as teachers in Israel. My   feelings and views are that the   Lord never did have a people from  Father Adam to the present time   that were called upon to build up  His Kingdom and establish His  Zion in the world, or to preach the  gospel of repentance to the children  of men, but what they were de-  pendent entirely upon the God of  heaven for their support.    The Lord has told us by revela-  tion to speak as we may be moved  upon by the Holy Ghost. When a   man speaks as he is moved upon by  the Holy Spirit, what he says is the  word of the Lord; it is the mind of  the Lord, it is scripture, it is the  will of the Lord, it is the power   of God unto salvation to everyone that  believes. Why? Because the Holy   Ghost is one of the personages of the  Godhead. God the Father and God   the Son posess tabernacles, and  God himself has created man after  His own image; but the Holy Ghost  is a personage of Spirit, which bears  witness of the Father and Son unto  the children of men.    With regard to the rights of the   human family I wish to say that   God has given unto all of His chil-  dren of this dispensation, as He   gave unto all of His children of  previous dispensations, individual  agency. This agency has always  been the heritage of man unto the  rule and government of God. He  possessed it in the heaven of heav-  ens before the world was, and the   Lord maintained and defended it   there against the aggression of   Lucifer and those that took sides  with him, to the overthrow of   Lucifer and one-third part of the  heavenly hosts. By virtue of this   agency you and I and all mankind  are made responsible beings, respon-  sible for the course we pursue, the  lives we live, the deeds we do in the  body. I will repeat here what I have  often remarked as the words and   sentiments of the Prophet Joseph  who once declared it in my hearing.   Said he, "If I were ruler or emperor   of the world, and I had power over   the whole human family, I would   make every man, woman and child   free in the enjoyment of his or her   religion, be that religion whatever  it may." These are my sentiments.   All people under heaven by virtue   of their agency, whether living un-  der a republican, a monarchical or  any other form of government, are   entitled to religious freedom to wor-  ship God according to the dictates  of their own conscience, they being  held accountable to God alone for  the use they make of their agency.  And while we, as a community,   accord this right and privilege to   man the world over, we claim the  same right ourselves. For we pro-  fess to believe in the fullness of the  Gospel of Jesus Christ which God   has revealed through the ministra-  tions of angels sent unto the serv-  ants of God in the dispensation in  which we live. It was made known  to John the Revelator and to others  of the Prophets and Apostles that  in the last days, among the many   great events which were to take   place before the coming of the Son  of Man, the everlasting Gospel   would be restored to the earth. Re-  ferring to this event the Apostle   says: "And I saw another angel   fly in the midst of heaven, having  the everlasting gospel to preach   unto them that dwell on the earth,  and to every nation, and kindred,   and tongue, and people, saying   with a loud voice, Fear God,   and give glory to Him: for  the hour of his judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##]  As Latter-day Saints we believe that  angels visited Joseph Smith whom   God raised up, and delivered unto   him the fulness of the Gospel; and   that he was ordained under the  hands of heavenly messengers who  held the keys of the Holy Priesthood  and also the Priesthood after the   order of Aaron.    Nearly sixty years have past   and gone since this Church was or-  ganized. It has fallen to my lot to   be associated with this people for the  last 56 or 57 years of my life. I  traveled with Joseph Smith and the  Apostles and with many who are   now in the spirit world, hundreds   and thousands of miles laboring for  the salvation of our fellow men.  We are very differently situated to-  day from what we were in the early  days of this Church. We now oc-  cupy permanent homes in the val-  leys of these Rocky Mountains.  I came here with Brigham   Young when the country was a  barren desert. The record of our   lives for the last forty years, during  which time we have been here, is   before the world as history. The   aim and object of our lives today are  what they were in the beginning,   namely the building up of the  Kingdom of God upon the earth.  And I wish to bear my testimony to  the Latter-day Saints and to the  world that this Gospel of the King-  dom which the angel of God de-  livered unto Joseph Smith will be  preached as a witness to all the  world before the end come. It is the  same Gospel that was preached by  Christ and the Apostles, and which  the Jews rejected. There is but one  Gospel plan of salvation, and it is   eternal and everlasting in its char-  acter; it cannot be perverted or   changed with impunity; hence the  Apostle Paul has said in this con-  nection, "Though we, or an angel   from heaven, preach any other Gos-  pel unto you than that which we   have preached unto you, let him be  accursed." [##Galatians 1:8##] What was the Gospel   taught by Paul, and by Peter,  James and John? The first princi-  ple of the Gospel they taught was   faith in God; the next was repent-  ance of sins, and then baptism for  the remission of sins. Jesus Him-  self was baptized of John, that he  might fulfil all righteousness, be-  cause baptism was a righteous law,  and one of the ordinances of the ever-  lasting Gospel. At first John de-  clined to baptize the Savior, recog-  nizing the fact that He was without  sin, and that baptism was for the re-  mission of sin. But Jesus answer-  ing said, "Suffer it to be so now: for  thus it becometh us to fulfil all   righteousness." And He baptized  the Savior and Redeemer of the   world. As soon as this ordinance  was attended to the heavens ac-  knowledged the act by the manifes-  tation of the Holy Ghost. [##Matthew 3:13-17##] And the   next ordinance after baptism is the  laying on of hands for the reception  of the Holy Ghost. This was the   Gospel taught by the Apostles while  they lived. The Holy Ghost gave  unto men a testimony that Jesus was  indeed the Christ, the Redeemer  of the World; and it was a guide to   their feet and a lamp to their path   during their whole lives. The   Church at first was organized upon  the foundation of Apostles and   Prophets, Christ Jesus being the  chief corner stone. We are told that   Christ has set in the Church, "First   apostles, secondarily prophets;"   that "He gave some apostles; and  some prophets; and some evan-  gelists; and some pastors and teach-  ers;" and they were to be standing [##Ephesians 4:11##] 
 514 THE DESERET NEWS. Sept. 15    DISCOURSE  BY  ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  DELIVERED  In the Salt Lake Assembly Hall, at  the Semi-Annual Conference of  the Salt Lake Stake of Zion,  Saturday Afternoon,  3rdJuly, 1880.  ------------------  REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.    I HAVE listened to the instructions  given here this afaernoon by my  brethren, as well as the remarks of   Brother Cannon, this forernoon, with  feelings of a great deal of interest.   When we talk of our duties as   Latter-day Saints I think many   times some of us, perhaps all of  us, more or less, fall short of compre-  dending and understanding the re-  sponsibilities which we are under to   God. I believe there never was a dis-  pensation or a generation of men   in any age of the world that ever  had a greater work to perform, or  ever were under greater responsibil-  ity to God, than the Latter-day  Saints. The kingdom of God has  been put into our hands. We have  been raised up as sons and daughters   of the Lord to take this kingdom, to  lay the foundation of it, to build up-  on it, to carry it out in its various  branches until it becomes perfected  before the heavens and before the   earth as God has foreordained it  should be. And those principles  which have been referred to by the   brethren in regard to our duties we   cannot safely ignore them nor turn  aside from them. I will say as one   of the quorum of the Twelve Apos-  tles, from the time I was first ac-  quainted with this organization until   to-day we have never felt ourselves  at liberty to stay away from our  meetings unless we were sick or cir-  cumstances hindered us in some   way or other. I can say that for   myself, and I believe I can say the   same for my brethren. We have  always felt duty bound to attend our  meetings, and if we do not attend   the question might arise, what has  become of the Twelve Apostles?  Where are they that they do not at-  tend their meetings? It would be a   very proper question to ask. And   if this responsibility rests upon us in   the capacity which we occupy does  it not rest upon other men? I think   it does. I do not believe the Lord   ever required Joseph Smith or Brig-  ham Young or any of their counselors   to undertake to build up this king-  dom alone. He never required them  to build these temples alone. They   were required to perform their duties,   that is true.  Joseph Smith was   called of God, inspired of God, raised  up of the Lord, ordained of God long   before he was born, to stand in the  flesh, as much as Jeremiah or any of  the ancient prophets, to lay the foun-  dation of this Church and kingdom.  He performed his work faithfully.  He labored faithfully while he taber-  nacled in the flesh, and sealed his   testimony with his blood. Other   men were called also to build upon  the foundation which he laid.    We have in days that are past  and gone been under the necessity  of going forth to preach the gospel in  the world. We have had this to do.   We have been called to do it. We   have been ordained to do it. We  have been commanded of God to do   it, and so have hundreds and thou-  sands of the elders of this Church  and kingdom. We have all some  responsibility, more or less, resting   upon us, whether as regards going   on missions or anything else. I re-  member Brother Joseph Smith vis-  ited myself, Brother Taylor, Brother  Brigham Young and several other   missionaries, when we were about to   take our mission to England. We  were sick and afflicted many of us.   At the same time we felt to go.   The Prophet blessed us as also our   wives and families; and I was read-  ing a day or two ago his instructions   from my journal. He taught us  some very important principles, some  of which I here name. Brother  Taylor, myself, George A. Smith,  John E. Page and others had been  called to fill the place of those who  had fallen away. Brother Joseph  laid before us the cause of those men  turning away from the command-  ments of God. He hoped we would   learn wisdom by what we saw with  the eye and heard with the ear, and  and that we would be able to discern  the spirits of other men without be-  ing compelled to learn by sad experi-  ence. He then remarked that any   man, any elder in this Church and  kingdom — who pursued a course  whereby he would ignore or in other  words refuse to obey any known law  or commandment or duty — when-  ever a man did this, neglected any  duty God required at his hand in at-  tending meetings, filling missions,  or obeying counsel, he laid a founda-  tion to lead him to apostasy and this   was the reason those men had fellen.   They had misused the priesthood  sealed upon their heads. They had   neglected to magnify their calling as   apostles as elders. They had used  that priesthood to attempt to build   themselves up and to perform some  other work besides the building up  of the kingdom of God. And not only  did he give us this counsel, but the   same is given in the revelation of  God to us. I have ever read with  a great deal of interest that revelation  given to Joseph Smith in answer to  his prayer in Liberty jail. I have  ever looked upon that revelations of  God to that man, considering the  few sentences it includes, as contain-  ing as much principle as any revela-  tion God ever gave to man. He gave  Joseph to understand that he held   the priesthood which priesthood was   after the order of God, after the or-  der of Melchisedec, the same priest-  hood by which God himself per-  formed all his works in the heavens   and in the earth, and any man who   bore that priesthood had the same   power. That priesthood had com-  munication with the heavens, power  to move the heavens, power to per-  from the work of the heavens, and   wherever any man magnified that   calling, God gave his angels charge   concerning him and his ministrations  were of power and force both in this  world and the world to come; but  let that man use that priesthood for   any other purpose than the building  up of the kingdom of God, for which   purpose it was given, and the heavens   withdr[a]w themselves, the power of   the priesthood departs, and he is left   to walk in darkness and not in light,   and this is the key to apostasy of all   men whether in this generation or  any other.    Our responsibilities before the Lord   are great. We have no right to  break any law that God has given  unto us. The more we do so the less   power we have before God, before   heaven and before the earth, and  the nearer we live to God, the closer  we obey his laws and keep his com-  mandments, the more power we  will have, and the greater will be  our desire for the building up of the  kingdom of God while we dwell here  in the flesh.    We have no right to break the Sab-  bath. We have no right to neglect  our meetings to attend to our labors.   I do not believe there was any man  ever belonged to this Church and  kingdom since its organization has  ever made anything by going to at-  tending to his farm on the Sabbath: but  if your ox falls into a pit get him out;   work in that way is all just and right,  but for us to go farming to the neg-  lect of our meetings and other duties  devolving upon us is something we   have no right to do. The Spirit of   God does not like it, it withdraws   itself from us, and we make no money  by it. We should keep the Sabbath   holy. We should attend our meet-  ings.    This kingdom is advancing. It   has got to advance, and somebody  has got to build it up. Somebody  has got to labor in it. The God of   heaven has had a people prepared  before the world was made for this   dispensation. He had a people pre-  pared to stand in the flesh to take  this kingdom and bear it off, and the  very spirit of the prophets and apos-  tles who have gone before us has   been manifested in the lives of faith-  ful men and women from the organ-  ization of this Church until to-day  and will continue until the coming  of the Lord, as there are a great  many men and women who will live   their religion and carry out the pur-  poses of God on the earth.    It is our duty as apostles, as eld-  ers and as Latter-day Saints, to con-  template, to reflect, to read the word   of God, and try to comprehend our  condition, our position, and our re-  sponsibility before the Lord. If our  eyes were opened, if the vail were  lifted, and we should see our con-  dition, our responsibility, if we could  comprehend the feelings of God our   heavenly Father and the heavenly  hosts and the justified spirits made  perfect in their watch-care over us,   in their anxiety about us in our lab-  ors here while we are in the flesh,   we would all feel that we have no  time to waste in folly or anything   which brings to pass no good. All   of us as elders of Israel and as Latter-  day Saints bear some portion of the  holy priesthood, either the Melchis-  edec or Aaronic. It is a kingdom of   priests, and there is work enough for   this people to magnify their calling.   The Lord has agreed to sustain us,  and to break every weapon that is   formed against us. He has promised  to sustain Zion, and when the Pro-  phet saw this Zion of God in the  mountains his soul was filled with  joy and he cried, "sing, O heavens;  and be joyful, O earth; and break  forth into singing, O mountains; for  the Lord hath comforted his people,  and will have mercy upon his af-  f[l]icted." Again the Prophet says,   "Can a woman forget her sucking  child, that she should not have com-  passion on the son of her womb,—yea  they may forget, yet will I not forget  thee." Zion has been before the   face of the Lord since the creation of  the world! Our heavenly Father  has protected this people. We have  been favored from the day we set  our feet in the valleys of the moun-  tains notwithstanding the tribulation   and opposition we have had to con-  tend with. All the designs of the   wicked and ungodly to stop this  work have been thwarted. The hand  of God is over Zion. He is our com-  forter. He sustains us, and we have  every encouragement on the face of  the earth as Latter-day Saints to be  true and faithful unto him the little  time we spend in the flesh.    Our responsibilities are great, our  work is great. We not only have   the gospel to preach to the nations of   the earth, but we have to fill these  valleys, towns, cities &c., and we  have, among other important things,  to rear those temples unto the name  of the Lord before the coming of  Christ. We have got to enter into  those temples and redeem our dead—  not only the dead of our own family   but the dead of the whole spirit  world. This is part of the great   work of the Latter-day Saints. We  shall build these temples and if we   do our duty there is no power can   hinder this work, because the Lord   is with us. And certainly our aim   is high. As a people we aim at cel-  estial glory, we aim at the kingdom   of God. We have been raised up   for this purpose to warn the world,  to preach the gospel, to go to the  meek of the earth and bring them   to these valleys of the mountains, that  they may be delivered from the  power of sin and Satan. Our num-  bers are many compared with former  dispensations. Nevertheless, our nu-  mbers are few when compared with  the twelve or fourteen hundred mil-  lions of inhabitants who dwell in the   flesh. Still with the help of God,  we have power to redeem the world.   This is our work. We are obliged   to labor and to continue to while we  are here, and when we have finished  our work our sons the rising genera-  tion, have got to take this kingdom   and bear it off.    Eight of the quorum of the Twelve  Apostles are in the spirit world to-  day who were in the flesh when we   came here, and so they pass away one  after another, when they finished  their work. Do you suppose that in  their minds and feelings they re-  alized they had done too much? I  think not. Just so with those who  remain in the flesh. There is no   time to throw away, and I would to  God that the elders of Israel could  fully realize and compreehnd the  great work that God has put upon  their shoulders—the building up of   the kingdom.    This kingdom has continued to in-  crease and spread. When we came   here 33 years ago we found this place   a barren desert. There was no mark  of the white man here. It was a   desert indeed, hardly a green thing   to meet the eye. You can see to-day  for yourselves. The inhabitants of  Zion are a marvel and a wonder to   the world. They occupy these val-  leys of the mountains from Idaho  to Arizona. The valleys, as it were,   are filled with Latter-day Saints.   And who are these Latter-day   Saints? They are the people whom   the God of heaven has raised up in  fulfilment of promise and revelation.   He has carefully gathered them to-  gether by the power of the gospel, by  the power of revelation and placed  them here in the valleys of the  mountains. Has there ever been  any power formed against this peo-  ple that has been successful? Nay;  and this people will never see the  day when our enemies shall prevail,  for the very reason that God had de-  creed that Zion shall be built up,  the kingdom that Daniel saw shall  roll forth, until the little stone cut   out of the mountain without hands  shall fill the whole earth. The  people of God shall be prepared in  the latter-days to carry out the great  programme of the Almighty, and  all the powers of the earth and hell  combined cannot prevent them.   When I see the view that the world  take in regard to this great latter-day  work; when I hear it questioned as  to whether God has anything to do  with it; when I see the feeling of  hatred that is manifested towards   us, to me it is the strongest evidence  that this is the work of God. Why?  Because we have been chosen out of  the world and therefore the world   hate us. This is a testimony that  Jew and Gentile and the whole world   look at. Then if this is the work of   God what is the world going to do  about it? What can this nation or the  combined nations of the earth do  about it? Can any power beneath   the heavens stay the progress of the  work of God? I tell you nay, it can-  not be done. I do not boast of these  things as the work of man; it is the  work of the Almighty; it is not the   work of man. The Lord has called  men to labor in his kingdom, and I   wish the elders would look upon this   subject as it is and realize our pos-  ition before the Lord. Here we are   a handful of people chosen out of  some twelve or fourteen hundred  millions of people; and my faith in   regard to this matter is that before   we were born, before Joseph Smith  was born, before Brigham was born—  my faith is that we were chosen to   come forth in this day and genera-  tion and do the work which God  has designed should be done. That  is my view in regard to the Latter-  day Saints, and that is the reason  why the apostles and elders in the  early days of this Church had power  to go forth without purse or scrip  and preach the gospel of Christ and  bear record of his kingdom. Had it  not been for that power we could  not have performed the work. We  have had to be sustained by the  hand of God until to-day, and we  shall be sustained until we get   th[r]ough, if we keep the command-  ments of God, and if we do not we  shall fall, and the Lord will raise up  other men to take our place. There-  fore, I look upon it that we had a  work assigned to us before we were   born. With regard to the faithful  leaders of this Church and kingdom,  beginning with Joseph Smith, how  many times have I heard men say  in my travels—Why did God choose  Joseph Smith, why did he choose  that boy to open up this dispensation  and lay the foundation of this  Church? why didn't he choose some  great man, such as Henry Ward  Beecher? I have had but one an-  swer in my life to give to such a ques-  tion, namely, that the Lord Almigh-  ty could not do anything with them,  he could not humble them. They  were not the class of men that were   chosen for a work of this kind in any  age of the world. The Lord Al-  mighty chose the weak things of this  world. He could handle them. He   therefore chose Joseph Smith be-  cause he was weak, and he had   sense enough to know it. He had  the ministration of angels out of   heaven. He had also the ministra-  tion of the Father and the Son, and  of the holy men who once dwelt  in the flesh.    We have been obliged to acknowl-  edge the hand of God. From out of   the pit have we been dug. We have  been taken from the plough, the   bench, the various occupations of  life, having limited knowledge of  what the world calls learning. The  Lord has called this class of men as  elders, and inspired by the power of  God they have gone forth and warn-  ed the world, and those of this gen-  eration who reject the testimony of  these elders will be under condem-  nation, for the elders will rise up in  judgment and condemn them. The  building up of this kingdom rests  upon our shoulders—not upon the  shoulders of Brother Taylor and the   Twelve Apostles alone, but every  man and every woman who has  heard this gospel and gone into the  waters of baptism will be held re-  sponsible for the light and knowledge  they received.    This is my testimony to you to-  day. You have got the kingdom of   God here. It has grown and in-  creased, and will continue to grow  and increase. I look at this building;  I look at the tabernacle here; I look   at the temples that are being built;  I see what is going on in the moun-  tains of Israel, and I ask what is it?  It is the work of God. I acknowledge  his hand in it. This is the reason   why we are inspired to build these   temples. Why we labor to build   them is because the day has come  when they are needed. Joseph  Smith went into the spirit world to  unlock the prison doors in this dis-  pensation or generation. He stayed  here long enough to lay the founda-  tion of this kingdom and obtain the  keys belonging to it. The last time   he ever met with the quorum of the   Twelve was when he gave them  their endowments, and when they  left him he had a presentiment that  it was the last time they would ever   meet. He had something to do the  other side of the vail. He had a  thousand to preach to there where  you and I have one in the flesh.   And this is the great work of the  last dispensation—the redemption   of the living and the dead.    We ought not, as elders of Israel, to   treat lightly the blessings we enjoy.   We ought not to treat lightly the  holy priesthood, or attempt to use it  for any other purpose under the   whole heavens other than to build  up the Zion of God. The counsel  that has been given this forenoon  upon this matter we should lay to   heart. The eyes of all the heavenly  hosts are over this people. They  are watching us with the deepest   anxiety. They understand things  better than we do, for our vail is our  bodies, and when our spirits leave  them we will not have a great way   to get into the spirit world. They  know the warfare we have with  wicked spirits and with a wicked   world, but what encouragement we  have when we read the revelations!  We live in a generation when the   Lord has decreed that his kingdom  shall be preserved. The prophets of  every other dispensation have been  called to seal their testimony with   their blood. My faith is that those   of this dispensation will not be called   to do this. Joseph and Hyrum, it  is true, were called to lay down their  lives. Why? I believe myself it  was necessary to seal a dispensation  of this almighty magnitude with  the blood of the testator for one  thing, and for another thing the  people were worthy that put him to  death, and will have the bill to pay   as the Jews had to pay for the blood   of the Messiah; but as far as the  leaders of this people and the people  generally are concerned, I think the  Lord intends we should live at peace.   With regards to Brigham Young, we  all know the disposition there was  on the part of his enemies to take   his life. I never believed, however,   that he would die a violent death.  Neither do I believe that we shall   be required to go forth and stain our  swords in the blood of our fellow  men in our defense. It has been   decreed that the wicked shall slay   the wicked. Now, I give you my  views regarding these things. I  speak the sentiments of my own  heart and what I believe. The judg-  ments of our God will be poured  forth, but the elders of Israel will  not be called upon to slay the wicked.  The wicked will slay the wicked.   When I read the Bible, the Book of  Mormon and the Book of Doctrine  and Covenants, I feel that it is with  us as with the generation that lived  in the days of Ezekiel. In those   days the Lord told the prophet to   tell the people that what he said he  meant to fulfil. And so it is in the   day and age in which we live. All   things will be fulfilled. The judg-  ments of Almighty God will be  poured out upon the wicked. The  harvest is ripe, and I know the   farmer has got to cut his crops when  they are ripe, otherwise they will go  back into the ground and rot.    When I see the wickedness and  abomination that prevail in Babylon,  covering the earth, as it were, like a   mighty sea—when I see these things  I feel to ask myself the question,   how long can these sins rise up in  the sight of heaven and not have   their reward? In my own mind I  can see a change at our door. In  the face of the revelations I cannot  see how it can be otherwise. The  signs of heaven and earth all indi-  cate the near coming of the Son of   Man. You read the 9th, 10th and  11th chapters of the last Book of  Nephi, and see what the Lord has  said will take place in this genera-  tion, when the gospel of Christ has  again been offered to the inhabitants  of the earth. The Lord did not re-  veal the day of the coming of the  Son of Man, but he revealed the  generation. That generation is upon   us. The signs of heaven and earth  predict the fulfillment of these things,  and they will come to pass.    Therefore, let us try to live our re-  ligion. We have the kingdom of   God. There is no question about  this. There was none with Joseph   Smith when the angels of God min-  istered unto him, and we had a liv-  ing testimony of this work from that  day to this. What is the greatest   testimony any man or woman can  have as to this being the work of   God? I will tell you what is the   greatest testimony I have ever had,  the most sure testimony, that is the  testimony of the Holy Ghost, the   testimony of the Father and the  Son. We may have the ministration  of angels; we may be wrapt in the   visions of heaven—these things as   testimonies are very good, but when   you receive the Holy Ghost, when  you receive the testimony of the   Father and the Son, it is a true prin-  ciple to every man on earth, it de-  ceives no man, and by that princi- 
 AN ADDRESS to the officers and members of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints:    Dear Brethren and Sisters—It has   been a practice in the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints, sanctioned   by the word of the Lord, to fast and   pray, and in this manner to seek for  that faith which Saints should possess,   and obtain that spirit of humility   which we are commanded to cultivate.    Shortly after the arrival of the people  in the valley of the Great Salt Lake,  the first Thursday in each month was  set apart as a day of fasting and   prayer. The members of the Church  were enjoined to bring on that day   their contributions for the relief and   sustenance of the poor, and hand them  to the Bishop of the ward.    At the time of the adoption of this   regulation it was very convenient for  the people generally to meet together   in their places of worship on that day.   The conditions were such that they,  being of one faith, employers and em-  ployed, could leave their labor and  devote a few hours to  the Lord.    For many years these meetings were  well attended, and they were of a   most interesting character, and were a   comfort and a strength to all who   shared in them, as it was the practice  for persons of both sexes to bear their   testimony and take active part in them   in each ward under the direction of the  bishopric.    As the years rolled by, conditions  changed, and it became more difficult   for the people generally, and especially   those in steady employment, to attend   these meetings, until at the present   time they have dwindled to such an   extent that comparatively few have the  opportunity of attending them. Thurs-  day as a day of fasting and prayer in   the Church no longer serves   the object for which it was intended.    Our attention has been called to this  subject, and after mature deliberation,   it has been decided to change the day   that has heretofore been devoted to  this purpose. Instead of the custom-  ary assemblages in the various wards  throughout Zion on the first Thursday  in each month, we have concluded to  set apart the first Sunday in every   month as the day for the regular fast   meeting.    Hereafter, therefore, we desire the  Latter-day Saints, under the direction   of the Presidents of Stakes and the  Bishops, to meet in their several places   of worship on the afternoon of the first  Sunday in each month, whenever it   can be done conveniently, and devote   the meeting to the administration of   the Sacrament, to the bearing of testi-  mony by the members of the Church,  to the blessing of children and the con-  firming of members in the Church,  and to such other services as have  usually been attended to at such meet-  ings. We feel assured that excellent re-  sults will follow the giving of members   of the Church an opportunity to bear  their testimony to each other and to  seek for the gifts which the Lord has  promised to those who keep His com-  mandments.    Care should also be taken on such   occasions to see that the wants of the  poor are relieved by the contributions  of the Saints in their behalf, that no   cry of the indigent or suffering shall   arise from our land in the ears of the  Lord of Sabaoth.    In Salt Lake City, instead of the  people meeting in the Tabernacle on  the afternoon of the first Sunday in   each month, we have concluded that it  will be better for that service to be   dispensed with, and for the Latter-day   Saints to meet in their several wards  on that afternoon, so as to give all the   members of the ward, including the   aged and infirm, and others who are   unable to go to the Tabernacle, an op-  portunity to participate in the fast   meeting and share in the blessings of   the occasion. In other Stakes where   general meetings are held as in this   city, we suggest that they also be dis-  pensed with on the first Sunday of   each month, and that the Saints meet  in their places of worship in the sev-  eral wards.    In some places the custom has arisen   to consider it a fast to omit eating  breakfast. This is not in accordance   with the views and practice of the   past. When fasts were observed in   the early days, it was the rule to not  partake of food from the previous  day until after the meeting in the   afternoon of the fast day. In making   donations to the poor also it has been  the understanding that the food that   would be necessary for the two meals   should be donated to the poor, and as  much more as those who are liberally  inclined and have the means may feel  disposed to give.    In giving this counsel to the Church   upon this subject, we include all the   missions where the Elders are   laboring, either in the United States  or in foreign lands. We think   this arrangement will suit the  convenience and circumstances of  all the Latter-day Saints throughout   the world, and we would like it to be  observed by all the organized branches  of the Church in every land, so that   our fasting and praying may be uni-  form and the time be understood by  all.    Before closing this address to the  Saints, we feel led to say that  if there should be sickness or any  evil resting upon or threatening  the people, these meetings furnish   an excellent opportunity to bring such   afflictions and troubles before the Lord.   By approaching Him in the spirit of  humility and union, we can suppli-  cate Him to remove these afflic-  tions or evils from the individuals  or from the people. Our past ex-  perience has proved to us how will-  ing our Father in Heaven is to   hear our cries in the hours   of extremity and difficulty,   when we approach Him in a proper   spirit and with proper faith. He is  quick to hear the cries of His people,  and He has promised to us that if we will   draw near unto Him, He will draw  near unto us. Such occasions as these,   therefore, ought to be taken advantage  of by the afflicted, whether in an in-  dividual or in a collective capacity.    With constant prayers for your wel-  fare and happiness and the prosperity  of the work of God,    We are your brethren,   WILFORD WOODRUFF,  GEORGE Q. CANNON,   JOSEPH F. SMITH,  First Presidency. 
 368   THE DESERET WEEKLY:    President Woodruff then addressed  the congregation. He said:    I want to say to my young brethren  and sisters and friends in the Sabbath  schools established here in the Rocky   mountains, God bless you and I feel to   bless you, as far as I have the power. I   want to say that this is a scene before   me today that has overpowered me—  it has overpowered my speech. I   would rather not say anything, still I   I feel I want to make a few remarks   to my friends.    I never in my life have been in   a similar position to that of   today. The scene before me has   been a fulfillment to all my prayers   from my boyhood up to early man-  hood. Eighty years ago I was a little  boy ten years of age attending school   the same as you are here in the moun-  tains of Israel. I read the New Testa-  ment. I read of Jacob, I read of the   Apostles and the Prophets. I could   not find a man on the face of the earth   who taught these principles or be-  lieved in them. I prayed to the God  of heaven that I might live to see a   Prophet; that I might live to see an   Apostle who would say something   that would satisfy me like unto the   principles I read of in the New Testa-  ment.    Today I stand in the midst of ten   thousand young men and women of   Israel—sons and daughters of prophets,   patriarchs and men of Israel. Men   who hold the Holy Priesthood ap-  pointed by God of Israel; appointed in   the last days to set up and carry these   laws and principles of God into effect.  It is these principles that we were to   look at in the last days. Now I want  to say to you as the rising generation,   I never expected to see a day of this   kind in my life, in my early   days. I did expect as it   was promised to me to see a prophet.   I have lived to see him. I have   traveled with prophets and patriarchs   and sons of God, I have lived to see   this body of intelligence of the sons of   the living God, who come here to the  meetings of Israel.    I rejoice in this for I see before me   the nature of the Latter-day Saints.   We cannot say the Bible is a novel—the   Bible that contains revelation. I have   passed through the periods of boyhood,   early manhood and old age. I   cannot expect to tarry a   great while longer with you  but I want to give to you a few words   of counsel. You occupy a position in   the Church and Kingdom of God and   have received the power of the Holy   Priesthood. The God of Heaven has   appointed you and called you forth in   this day and generation. I want you   to look at this. Young men listen to   the counsel of your elder brethren.   Live near to God; pray while young;  learn to pray; learn to cultivate the   Holy Spirit of God; link it to you and   it will become a spirit of revela-  tion unto you, inasmuch as you   nourish it. I feel thankful myself that   I have lived to see this day. I declare   unto you that there are many in the   flesh who will remain so until the   coming of the Son of Man.    This is about all I wish to say. I   feel thankful to my heavenly Father   that I see this scene before us this   afternoon; that I see the Gospel mani-  festations on the earth. There has  been, as it was stated by our brother,   two powers, one to destroy me and the   other to save me. And God in heaven  has willed to spare me to see this day.  He has given me power to reject every  testimony and reject every example   that leads to evil. I say to you chil-  dren, do not use tobacco, liquor or any   of these things that destroy the body   and mind, but honor Him and you   will have a mission upon your heads   that the world know not of. May God  bless you. Amen. 
 most foolish, nonsensical and false  doctrine. You gaze upon a man  who professes to have inherited the  body or spirit of Moses, or any of  those I have named, and I think  you will conclude that his appear-  ance does not indicate that such is  the case; at any rate, it certainly has  not improved him. Brother Wood-  ruff, Brother Cannon, Brother  Smith, Brother Lorenzo Snow, or  any of the brethren, will never in-  herit anyone's body or spirit but  their own, in time or in eternity,  unless the devil gets into them. It  is Satan who inspires men to believe  in such absurd things. He delights  in having any of the brethren en-  tertain false ideas, no matter what  they are. I tell you that whoever  sees me in time or eternity will see  Wilford Woodruff, not Noah, nor  Abraham, nor Enoch. Every man  has his own identity, and he never  will lose that identity. Therefore,  when you hear such doctrine as  that advanced, do not believe it.  There are a good many things Satan  would like us to believe; but we  must guard against these.    The Latter-day Saints need in-  struction; they need preaching to;  and we esteem it a great blessing to  be able to mingle with you, to speak  to you and to bear our testimony un-  to you. I say to the Latter-day  Saints that the visions of our minds  are open, the revelations of God  rest upon us, and the voice of God  to us is that the day has come when  we, as shepherds in Israel, holding  the Apostleship and keys of the  kingdom of God, should stand in the  midst of this people and call them to  repentance, call them to open their  eyes to see, and their ears to hear,  and to prepare themselves for the  great events the God of Israel is  about to bring to pass in the earth.    We live in a very important day.  Father Adam, three years previous  to his death, called his sons together  —Seth, Enos, Jared, Canaan, Ma-  ha'aleel, Enoch and Methusaleh,  with the residue of his posterity  —into the valley of Adam-  Ondi-Ahman, and there he  blessed his posterity. The power  of God rested upon him and  he told the people what should be-  fall them until the latest generation. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53-56##]  These things are all written in the  Book of Enoch, which will be re-  vealed in the due time of the  Lord. Since then there have been  Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac and  Jacob, and other patriarchs and  prophets. All of them saw, by vi-  sion and revelation, this day and  this people. They proclaimed our  history from the beginning to the  end. Where are these men today?  They stand, in their immortal  bodies, in the presence of God and  the Lamb. They are watching over  us. We are their children and we  are fulfilling the mission of the last  dispensation of the fulness of times.  I feel sometimes to ask, where are  the hearts and feelings of the people  who have embraced this work? It  is a glorious work, a grand work.  The Prophet Isaiah, in speaking of  Zion, says:    "Arise, shine; for thy light is  come, and the glory of the Lord is  risen upon thee. * * *    And the Gentiles shall come to thy  light, and kings to the brightness of  thy rising." [##Isaiah 60:1-3##]    One hundred and fifty thousand  of those Gentiles that Isaiah saw  have gathered to these valleys of the  mountains, in obedience to the Gos-  pel of Christ. Is not that Gospel  as true today as it ever was? Are  not the revelations of the Almighty  as true today as they were in the  days of Adam, and Enoch, and  Moses, and Christ and His Apostles?  They are. And we have been  reserved in the spirit world for  thousands of years, to stand in  the flesh in the latter days, and to  take God's kingdom and build it up.  Understanding these things then,  what are we, as Latter-day Saints,  thinking about? We have got a  great warfare to fight. Lucifer, the  son of the morning, and all his  hosts, are united against us. We  are but a little handful, compared  with the inhabitants of the earth.  There never were but few men and  women, in any age of the world, who  were independent enough to reject  evil and to serve the Lord. But we  have been counted worthy to be  numbered as His people. It is time,  therefore, that we arose, that we  awoke, and that, clothed upon with  the power of God and the Holy  Priesthood, we should magnify this  Priesthood and obtain the blessings  belonging thereto. This people have  power to contend with the heavens,  and to control the heavens, in a  measure. With this Priesthood  resting upon them, this people have  power that when their prayers shall  ascend into the ears of the God of  Israel, they shall be heard and ans-  wered upon their heads. Shall we  desert the Lord? Shall we desert  His cause? God forbid. There is no  mistake about this work. The Lord  is not trifling with us. We have  the same eternal and everlasting  Priesthood that God has kept in the  heavens for eighteen hundred years.  Will you tell me that we have not  power to fulfill the commandments  of God? If you do, you tell me  that which is not true. The God  of heaven has given us all needful  power, if we will only rise up and  magnify it before the heavens and  the earth. We have no time to  contend or quarrel over water  ditches. We should be united to-  gether and magnify our callings be-  fore the Lord; for I tell you there is  no time to spare. The Almighty is  going to cut short His work in  righteousness, or no flesh could be  saved. The heavens are full of  judgments, and all those who re-  main in Babylon, God will not  spare; they will be burned with the  wicked. We are responsible for the  use which we make of the power  God has given us. I tell you the  devil has no power, the Gentiles  have no power over the Latter-day  Saints when they do their duty and  are united. It is not ordained for the  wicked to have power to bring to  pass evil upon us, if we are united.  Zion shall not be moved out of her  place, saith the Lord. But the day  has come when the Lord calls upon  Zion to arise, and upon these Apos-  tles and these Elders of Israel to  feed the flock of Christ. We should  teach them the words of life and  salvation, and the Latter-day Saints  should hear us and lay these things  to heart. They should fulfil the  commandments of God. We are  here only upon a short mission. We  are the messengers of the God of  Israel, messengers of life and salva-  tion. And if we will do our duty  and obey the commandments of  God, we shall accomplish all that  the Lord expects us to do.    Brethren and sisters, do not  quarrel one with another; do not  contend about water or anything of  that kind. I tell you that the man   who, rather than quarrel with his  neighbor, will say, "Take my water;  I won't contend with you," that  man will get a good deal more  wheat than the one who fights and  quarrels and goes to law about his  water. He will be blessed of the  Lord and justified before Him. Let  us put all these things aside and call  upon the Lord in mighty prayer,  asking that His blessings may be  upon us, and that His revelations  may be fulfilled upon our heads;  that Zion may be purified and the  Saints of God be united together.    This is the way we, as the Presi-  dency of the Church and as Apostles,  feel. I want you to understand that  God is with us, that the keys of the  Kingdom of God are here, and that  Zion is here, and they have all  come to stay. I rejoice in this; I  rejoice in the Gospel of Christ, in  which there is no change from  eternity to eternity.    Brethren and sisters, let us try to  live our religion and sanctify our-  selves before the Lord. Seek for the  Holy Spirit; pray for it; and labor  for visions, for dreams, for revela-  tions and for the gifts of the Gospel  of Christ, that they may strengthen  us in the good work. I pray God to  bless you and those who preside  over you, as well as those who labor  in this Temple in Manti, and in all  other Temples in Zion. They are  performing a glorious work in these  Temples. And when we get through  our work here, I trust we will be  together in the Kingdom of God on  the other side of the veil. This is  my prayer and desire, in the name  of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 84  and I now take the liberty, through  the channel of the press, to invite all  in that region of country, and in all  other places, into whose hands these  lines may fall, that have not already  obeyed the fulness of the gospel of  Jesus Christ, to repent of all their  sins, and be baptized in water for the  remission of their sins, that they may  receive the gift of the Holy Ghost  by the laying on of hands,--that they  may have upon them the wedding  garment, that their lamps may be  trimmed and burning, and be pre-  pared to go forth and meet the Bride-  groom, who is at the door--for the   day when the Lord Jesus shall cleanse  the earth, by the spirit of judgement  and the spirit of burning, from sin,  wickedness, and pollution, until it be-  comes a fit abode for the Saviour to  dwell upon, and reign one thousand  years with his saints.    W. WOODRUFF.  Manchester, July 9th 1840    MINUTES OF THE CONFERENCE  HELD AT THE  GADFIELD ELM CHAPEL, IN WORCESTERSHIRE, ENGLAND,  JUNE 14TH 1840.    The Preachers and Members of the Bran Green and Gadfield Elm Branch  of the Froome Hill Circuit of the United Brethren met at the Gadfield Elm  Chapel, Worcestershire, June 14th, 1840, pursuant to previous notice, when  the meeting was called to order by Elder Thomas Kington. Elder Willard  Richards was chosen President, and Elder Daniel Browett, Clerk, for the  meeting. The meeting opened by prayer by Elder W. Woodruff. Remarks  were then made by the President, respecting the business of the day, and the   necessary changes which must take place.    It was moved by Elder T. Kington, seconded by Elder Daniel Browett,  that this meeting be hereafter known by the name of the "Bran Green and   Gadfield Elm Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day  Saints," organised and established by the will and commandment of God, in  the United States of America, on the 6th day of April A.D. 1830, this being  the eighth day of the third month of the eleventh year of the rise of the  Church. Carried unanimously.    Moved by Elder W. Woodruff, seconded by Elder T. Kington, that Wil-  liam Jenkins be ordained an Elder, and William Coleman, Joseph Finkins,   William Pitt, and Robert Harris, be ordained to the office of priest; and that  George Burton, James Palmer, and William Loveridge, be ordained Teachers.  Carried unanimously. Ordained under the hands of Elders Richards and  Woodruff.    Moved by Elder Kington, seconded by Elder Woodruff, that  Robert Clift, Priest, have care of the Church at Dymock.  James Palmer, Priest, [have the care of the Church at] Kilcott.  John Hill, Priest, [have the care of the Church at] Twigworth.  William Coleman, Priest, [have the care of the Church at] Bran Green.  Thomas Brooks, Priest, [have the care of the Church at] Ryton.  John Smith, Priest, [have the care of the Church at] Lime Street. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  227    they were Apostles their power fell   from them. If a man wishes to keep   faithful, he has got to live near unto   the Lord, remember his prayers,   and realize that he is at work for   the Lord and for His Kingdom.    I thank God that you are united   here. I hope you will continue to   be so. Do not quarrel over any-  thing. It makes me sorrowful when   I hear of men holding the Priest-  hood wanting to go to law because   they have not got sufficient water.   This is wrong. It is against the law   of God. When we are united we   have power with God and with each   other. I hope and pray that we   may so live in these valleys of the   mountains that every operation   against us may come to naught,   and it will if we do our duty. I do not   pretend to know how many tribula-  tions or how much suffering we   shall yet have to endure before Zion   is established in her beauty and   glory; but I do know that Zion is   not going to be moved out of her   place. The Lord, however, will   chastise us until we become purified   before Him. He will plead with   His strong ones, and what He has s  aid concerning Zion will come to   pass. I hope that we may exercise   wisdom in all things, that we may   escape these afflictions.    Let us try to live our religion and   to do right the few days we have to   spend on the earth. Some of us   have not got a great deal of time to   spend here. We shall soon pass   away. Therefore, let us be united   together and all will be well. Then   when we get through here we may   associate on the other side of the   veil with those that we have asso-  ciated with here on the earth and   with the Patriarchs and Prophets   that have gone before. The bless-  ings of God will attend Zion, and   His judgments will rest upon the   wicked.    I pray God that the union you   have here may increase, and   that our young men will rise up and   magnify their callings before  the Lord, and treasure up wisdom,  knowledge and understanding, and   learn those things that will assist   them in their duties; for, as I said   before, this Kingdom has got to rest   upon the shoulders of the rising   generation of the Latter-day Saints.   This is the destiny to which they   are approaching. I feel thankful   that I have had this privilege of   meeting with you and of listening   to what has been said. I pray God   to bless you, and those who preside   over you, that you may be of one  heart and one mind, and be prepared   to inherit eternal life. Amen 
 twelve tribes of Israel, because   they were righteous in the latter  days.    Following this, John says:    "And I saw another angel fly in  the midst of heaven, having the   everlasting Gospel to preach unto  them that dwell on the earth, and   to every nation, and kindred, and  tongue, and people,    "Saying with a loud voice, Fear   God, and give glory to Him; for the  hour of his judgment is come."    Again, John says:    "And there followed another  angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is   fallen, that great city, because she   made all nations drink of the wine  of the wrath of her fornication.    Following this, he speaks of the  reaping down of the earth and of  the judgments of God which were  to come upon the inhabitants   thereof.    In fulfillment of the declaration  of St. John, the angel of God has  flown through the midst of heaven.  He has delivered the Gospel of Jesus  Christ to the inhabitants of the  earth, and revealed unto them the  word of the Lord. The Holy  Priesthood has also been restored.  This Gospel was to be preached "to  every nation, and kindred, and  tongue, and people." It has now  been preached almost sixty years —  from the organization of the Church  until today; and in fulfillment of  the revelations of these inspired   Prophets and Apostles, a multitude  of people are today gathered to-  gether in these valleys of the moun-  tains. In fulfillment of those reve-  lations I stand today in this Taber-  nacle, which the prophet saw was  to be built upon the tops of the   mountains, as a covering from the  heat and the storm. In this Taber-  nacle today, also, are ten thousand  Latter-day Saints, which is a wit-  ness to Jew and Gentile of the ful-  fillment of the promises of God.   Yet the infidel says, "Behold, there   is no God." The man who says there  is no God is a fool. We are here in  fulfillment of prophesy and revela-  tion. We have received the Gospel  of Christ. The Kingdom of God   has been organized. It is rolling on;  and it will continue to roll on until   this scene is wound up.    Now, I want to give a little ex-  hortation to my brethren. Brother   George Q. Cannon touched upon a   very important principle this fore-  noon — a principle which has often   rested upon my mind; that is, with   regard to the spirits that surround   us. He said that one-third of the  hosts of heaven were cast out be-  cause of their rebellion. I suppose   we may say that at least one hun-  dred thousand millions were cast   down from heaven to earth. Where  are they? Some are in Salt Lake,   some in New York, some in Am-  sterdam, some in Constantinople,  some in Jerusalem; in fact, they are  in every city and hamlet wherein   the inhabitants of the earth dwell,   and especially where there are any  Latter-day Saints. And whether  there are one hundred or not to   every man, woman and child, there   are enough of them, at least, to  labor for our overthrow. I say to   my Counselors, to the Apostles, to  the Seventies, the High Priests,  the Bishops, and all men who bear   the Holy Priesthood, do you sup-  pose these devils are around us  without trying to do something?   Are they asleep? Have they not a   work to perform? I say to my   brethren who bear the Priesthood,  we have got a mighty warfare to  wage with these spirits. We  cannot escape it. What will   they do to you? They will try to  make us do anything and every-  thing that is not right. These   devils would be very glad to make  me and my brethren think we are  great men, smarter than any one   else; to divide us one against the  other, and to cause us to seek to  confess our brother's sins instead of   our own. We should therefore   watch ourselves well. I should do   this; my Councilors and the Apostles  should; we all should. And unless   we are united together, as has been   said before, we are not the Lord's.  But today we have certainly mani-  fested a union here that the world  is not acquainted with.  We have,   however, a mighty responsibility   resting upon us. The eyes of all  the heavenly hosts are upon us.  The eyes of Father Adam, and the  patriarchs and prophets, both an-  cient and modern, who have  gone to the other side of the   veil, are over us. And if our eyes   are opened to comprehend the things   of God, we can comprehend our re-  sponsibilities; we can comprehend   the powers of the Holy Priesthood  and the relationship which we sus-  tain to God. We certainly should  humble ourselves before the Lord.  We should labor with all our might   to build up the Kingdom of God in  what little time we have to spend  here in the flesh. Our aim is high.   We aim at eternal life; we aim at   immortal glory; we aim at a place  in the celestial Kingdom of our God,   with God and Christ and those who  have kept the celestial law. In   order to get there, we have got to   keep the same law that has exalted   those who have gone before us.  This is not our home. We were   kept in the spirit world until this  generation, and have been brought   forth, through the loins of Joseph   and Ephraim, to stand in the flesh   and to bear off the Kingdom, to   hold the Holy Priesthood, to do the   works of righteousness, to build  temples, to redeem our dead, and to  attend to those ordinances which the  God of heaven has declared we shall   perform. This is our work. We   have a long eternity before us. But  all of us will have to meet at the  bar of God — the righteous and the  wicked, those who are living and   those who are dead.    This is the condition of the Lat-  ter-day Saints. I hope that we may  escape the power of the enemy.  As   was said here this forenoon, it mat-  ters but very little what may take  place outside of Zion, or outside of   the Kingdom of God. The God of  Israel holds the destiny of this na-  tion; He holds the destiny of this   people, and of all men on the face of   the earth. They are at His com-  mand and in His power. He will   hold this nation, as He did Jerusa-  lem, responsible for the course they  pursue with regard to the Latter-  day Saints. We also will be held   responsible for the course we pursue.   The Lord has led this Church from   its organization until the present   day. He will lead it until the com-  ing of the Son of Man. He is not  going to desert His people nor His   cause. But it is our duty to plead  with the Lord, remember our pray-  ers, keep our covenants, and walk   perpetually before Him, that we   may have His favor and blessing  resting upon us.    I wish to say with regard to the   rising generation — the sons and  daughters of the Latter-day Saints  — that they should take the counsel  of their fathers; they should honor  their parents, and honor God, and  receive such counsel as is given un-  to them by wise men. I think  many times that our children do not  comprehend the position they oc-  cupy. They do not comprehend  what lies before them. Their fathers   are passing away. Yet this King-  dom has got to remain on the earth  until the coming of the Son of Man.   This work has got to follow their  fathers; it has got to rest upon the  sons and daughters of Zion. I have  a great desire that the institu-  tions which have been organized in  Zion for their welfare may be   blessed; that our sons and daughters  may attend the Primaries, the Sab-  bath Schools and Mutual Improve- 
 ministers to the Church "for the  perfecting of the Saints, for the work   of the ministry, for the edifying of the  body of Christ till we all come in  the unity of the faith, and of the   knowledge of the Son of God, into a   perfect man, unto the measure of   the stature of fullness of Christ." [##Ephesians 4:12-13##]  The Lord required Joseph Smith to  organize the Church of Christ after  this order. He did so, and this   Church has remained intact in its  organization from that day to the   present; and it will continue to  remain until the coming of the Son  of Man. And I would say here   that there is no change of the Gos-  pel of Christ in this, neither has   there been in any other age of the   world. There never has been any   change from eternity to eternity,  neither has there been any change   of the ordinances, or of the Holy   Priesthood; they are the same "yes-  terday, today and forever." [##Hebrews 13:8##]    I will also make a remark with   regard to our views of the Priest-  hood. Jesus Christ is our High   Priest. He held the Priesthood af-  ter the order of Melchisedec, which   is without beginning of days or end   of years, being from eternity to eternity. We have been informed   that Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan,   Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuse-  lah, Lamech, and Noah, were all   High Priests. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] In all the dispensa-  tions whenever God has had a peo-  ple upon the earth, no man has ever   been called to administer in any of   the ordinances of the Gospel except   by and through the eternal and   everlasting Priesthood. We cannot   learn from the Bible—"the stick of   Judah," [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##] the record of the Jews—  that God ever called a man to offici-  ate in the offering of sacrifices,   or to administer in any of the   ordinances of the Gospel, ex-  cept by and through the Priest-  hood. And our belief is that no   man has a right to minister in this   age in the ordinances of the House   of God, except he be duly called and   ordained. The Holy Priesthood is   the channel through which God   communicates and deals with  man upon the earth; and the   heavenly messengers that have  visited the earth to communicate   with man are men who held and   honored the Priesthood while in the   flesh; and everything that God has   caused to be done for the salvation   of man, from the coming of man   upon the earth to the redemption of  the world, has been and will be by  virtue of the everlasting Priesthood.    Our Elders who are called to bear   this Priesthood are being sent abroad  to preach the Gospel without purse  or script, and they are blessed in   their labors. [##Doctrine and Covenants 24:18-19##] Truly has it been   said the Lord has called the weak   things of the world to confound   the wisdom of the wise, and to  bring to pass the purposes of God.   And they like the servants of the   Lord of former days have promised  to all those who obey the Gospel  that they should receive the Holy   Ghost. I have often said, and I   say again, we might have preached  to the whole world until we had be-  come as old as Methuselah if the  testimony of our Elders had not  been backed up by the gift of the  Holy Ghost, Utah would be today  as barren as we found it in 1847;   that is, as far as our being here is   concerned. It is the Spirit of God,   the testimony of Jesus, that has  been imparted to the Saints in fulfil-  ment of the promise of the Elders   who preached the Gospel to them in  their native lands, that has impelled  this people to gather to these valleys   of the mountains. And if I were   to call upon all those of this con-  gregation who have received this   testimony to rise to their feet, the  Latter-day Saints of this congrega-  tion would respond in a body. If   the people had not received this   testimony they never would have  left their homes and friends to   come here. You knew it was not   the work of man, but the work of  God, and you labored diligently to   effect your deliverance from Baby-  lon because you were moved upon  by the Spirit of God, and you never   rested until you emigrated.    We are called of God to establish   His Zion upon the land of Joseph.   You have the Bible, which the   Christian world profess to believe   in, as well as the Book of Mormon,   which you believe in. These rec-  ords and revelations of God testify   of your day. Isaiah pointed out  your history, your travels in coming   to these western valleys, your labors   here; and if we had not gathered  here, much of the Bible prophesies  would have failed in their fulfil-  ment. Many say these revelations  are to be spiritually construed, that   they are not intended to be under-  stood in a literal sense. We view   these things differently. We take it   what the Lord through His   servants has said concerning  this matter means what He   has said and said what he means.   It is true we have passed through a  good deal of persecution; but in   this we are no exception to the rest   of God's servants and people of other  ages. The records that have come   to us testify of these things. Oppo-  sition to God and His Christ, oppo-  sition to light and truth has existed  since the beginning to the present   day. This is the warfare that com-  menced in heaven, that has existed   through all time, and that will con-  tinue until the winding up scene,   until He reigns whose right it is to  reign, when He shall come in clouds  of glory to reward every man ac-  cording to the deeds done in the   body.    We live in a peculiar dispensation—  I will say the great and last dispen-  sation of God to man. And what is   the state of our nation and that of  the Christian world? Unbelief with  regard to the fulfillment of what   the prophets have said should take  place in the last days. I have felt that  the Lord has become very unpopular   in this generation, and that His   revelations have become very un-  popular. Common schools turn the   Bible out of doors. Of course there  is a general profession of faith and   belief in God, but a decided unbe-  lief exists, and a general indiffer-  ence with regard to the fulfillment   of the predictions contained in the   Bible. A great many too believe   when a man dies that is the end of  him, that there is no hereafter. Can   any sensible man believe that the   God of heaven has created two or   three hundred thousand million   spirits, and given them tabernacles,   merely to come and live upon the   earth and then to pass away into   oblivion or to be annihilated? It  seems to me that no reflecting man   can entertain such belief. It is con-  trary to common sense and to seri-  ous reflection. Generation after   generation has lived and died,  has passed into the spirit world,   and we have to a limited extent an   account of the doings of God with   them. The Prophets, Apostles and   Patriarchs have left their inspired   writings on record for our use and  benefit, and we shall be held ac-  countable in the exercise of our   agency for the manner in which   we treat the Word of God that has   come unto us.    I testify that the God of heaven has  set His hand to establish His   Kingdom, and to build up His   Church and establish His Zion   upon the foundation of Prophets and   Apostles, Jesus Christ being the   chief corner stone. We live in a   dispensation different from any   other. The dispensation that ush-  ered in the Christian era was one of   sacrifice. The Savior came and  tabernacled in the flesh, and entered   upon the duties of the Priesthood at   30 years of age. After laboring   three and a half years He was cruci-  fied and put to death in fulfillment   of certain predictions concerning   Him. He laid down His life as a   sacrifice for sin, to redeem the world.  When men are called upon to repent   of their sins, the call has reference   to their own individual sins, not to   Adam's transgressions. What is   called the original sin was atoned  for through the death of Christ irre-  spective of any action on the   part of man; also man's indi-  vidual sin was atoned for by   the same sacrifice, but on condition   of his obedience to the Gospel plan   of salvation when proclaimed in   his hearing. This gospel we are  called to preach to the children of   men, calling on them to repent and   be baptized for the remission of their   sins, and promising them through   their obedience and faithfulness the   gift of the Holy Ghost, which shall   lead and guide them in the ways of   all truth and deliver them   from darkness and doubt. And the re-  sults of the preaching of the serv-  ants of God are seen today in what   is being done by this people; and it  is our duty to continue this  work, to warn mankind and  to gather the Israel of our   God. We will be held under con-  demnation if we do not do our duty;  if we do not warn the nations.   Whenever a nation or city has  ripened in iniquity, the Lord has  raised up Prophets to warn them of   the destruction that awaited them   unless they repented. The Lord  raised up Noah and commanded   him to preach repentance to the peo-  ple of his day, and instructed him   to build an ark for the salvation  of those who should believe on Him.   Enoch and his people were peculiar   from the rest of the world of his   day, and the wicked sought his life;   but the power of God was upon him 
 CONFERENCES.    The Manchester Conference having been called upon to assemble in the capacity   of a special conference, for the purpose of transacting such business as was deemed  necessary, I had the happy privilege, in company with elders Hedlock and Ward,  of meeting them on Sunday, Feb. 16th, at Mr. Heyward's large and commo-  dious room, in Bridge-street, Manchester. The day was exceedingly fine, which   caused a vast number of Saints to come in from the various districts until the room  was crowded to excess.    The house was called to order at half-past ten o'clock, A.M., there being present  one of the Twelve, five high priests, thirty elders, thirty-one priests, twenty-two  teachers, and four deacons.    Elder Woodruff was called to the chair, accompanied by his counsellors, elders  Hedlock and Ward. Conference opened by singing and prayer.    The president informed the assembly, that the forepart of the day would be  devoted to teaching and setting forth principles: the afternoon to business: and   the evening to preaching, and then called upon elder Hedlock to address the meet-  ing, and he did so, much to the edification of the Saints. He spoke of the death of   the Prophet and Patriarch, and the additional responsibility and care that was   now resting upon the presidency of the churches, in the enlargement and ad-  vancement of the church and kingdom of God. He spoke of the persecution   and the order of the priesthood, and that the object of the Conference was to   make some changes in the Manchester Conference for the advancement of the   work in that region. He was followed by elder Ward, who spoke of the great-  ness and magnitude of the work, the purity of the principles, and he exhorted the  officers and members to faithfulness. The President closed by bearing his testi-  mony to the work, and gave such teaching and advice as was given by the   Spirit of God, all of which was received by the Saints with a hearty Amen.    The Saints again assembled at two o'clock, P.M. Remarks were made by the   President and his Counsellors, concerning the importance of the meeting, and the   changes they would recommend in the Manchester Conference. It was then   moved by elder Charles Miller, "that elder Milton Holmes be appointed presiding  elder over the Manchester Conference; it was seconded and carried without a dis-  senting voice.    Elder M. Holmes then proposed elder Charles Miller, as his counsellor to assist  him in the conference; it was also seconded and carried unanimously.    It was then moved, seconded, and carried unanimously, that elder James D.  Ross, from Edinburgh, who was present, should be chosen to preside over the  Manchester branch; there was not a dissenting voice in any resolution presented  to the conference, but peace, union, and love apparently prevailed with every   heart. At the close of the afternoon service, we had the privilege of communing,  by partaking of the sacrament with that vast body of the Saints who have from  the beginning manifested much of a Zion's spirit, and brought forth the fruits of  the gospel. 
 A SHORT TOUR THROUGH THE CLITHEROE CONFERENCE.    On the 4th of May I met with the Saints in Blackburn by request, on the occa-  sion of the opening a new room for worship. I addressed them in the morning and   evening, and elder Speakman in the afternoon. The room was filled, and we had  an interesting time with the Saints. I found a flourishing branch of the church   here; it being also the first time I had ever been privileged with meeting the Saints  in the Clitheroe conference.    On the 5th, in company with elder Speakman, I visited the ruins of Whalley   Abbey, situated in a most beautiful locality of hills, and woods, and streams. It   had originally been very extensive, but ruins alone existed, with the exception of a   small portion of building which is occupied by a few families. It appears to have   been founded in the year 1000.    On the 6th we were favoured with a most interesting visit to Stoneyhurst, a   Catholic college, and as I was informed, the most extensive establishment in Eng-  land. One large room was splendidly decorated with paintings of great value, by   the great masters. The museum did not contain a large collection either of the   natural or animal kingdom, yet a number of specimens were rich and costly,  especially some small sculptures in marble, of the Saviour, valued at a very high  price.    We visited the various apartments of this extensive library, which we found  enriched with most valuable works, many of great antiquity, especially a copy of   St. Paul's Epistles, upon parchment, which was said to have been in the hands of   the society more than a thousand years; besides it lay Queen Mary's prayer-book,   and sundry antique articles.    The lodgings, studies, and chapel for the boys, appeared convenient and comfort-  able; they have several hundreds passing through a course of education.    The principal chapel connected with the college is fitted up in a most costly   manner; the organ, altar piece, crosses, candlesticks, &c., were rich indeed, while   one window contained a representation of the thirteen apostles (including St. Paul),  in stained glass as large as life, got up at a great expense. They have also a beau-  tiful garden connected with the establishment, the separate compartments of which   are divided by yew-tree fences, about twelve feet high, four feet thick, and from  forty to two hundred feet long, as the case required; I suppose not equalled in   extent in England.    After leaving the college we travelled to Waddington, a village a short distance   from Clitheroe, over the Ribble on the Yorkshire side, where we partook of the   hospitality of friend Cottom. While here we visited the alms-house built and dedi-  ated by Sir Robert Parker, A.D. 1700, for the poor widows of the parish.    On the 7th we walked to Clitheroe and Chatburn, and visited the Saints in  those places. I was much pleased with the meek and quiet spirit manifested amongst  them. I walked through the village of Chatburn, of which elder Kimball speaks  in his journal, as walking through it with his head uncovered and blessing the   place, while the children had hold of his garments as he passed along. I felt the  spirit of God rest upon me while passing through the street where such scenes of   interest had transpired with elder Kimball and other servants of God.    During our travels on the 8th, we had the pleasure of witnessing father  Richard Smithies display his skill in beguiling some fine trout from the river Ribble 
 to such an extent that the wicked  trembled at his words, and feared   him. At last he and his people were  translated, were taken from the  earth, and the disobedient of his day   were left to their own destruction.  The same fate befell the Jewish na-  tion in consequence of their rejec-  tion of the truth, and their treat-  ment of those who were sent unto  them. They put to death the ser-  vants of the Lord and crucified the  Messiah. All that had been predict-  ed concerning them came literally  to pass. Israel as a nation was over-  thrown; their temples destroyed, and  they that escaped death by the  sword were taken captive, and that  people have been trampled under  the feet of the Gentiles for the past  1800 years.    Now we understand there is a  feeling and spirit working among   the Jews to return to the land of  their fathers to re-build their city  and temple and prepare for the com-  ing of Shiloh their King. And  this will in time be accomplished.  We should have faith in God and   His promises, and we should read  the revelations that have come unto  us, and treasure them up. We are   all in the hands of God; He holds  our destiny and the destiny of this  nation. All are held by the power  of God. It is for us to understand  the signs of the times, for these   things are before us. This is not   our work; but if we are true and   faithful in this ministry we shall re-  ceive our inheritances upon the earth  according to the promises. That  our Father may bless us all, and   that we may be true and faithful to  Him and to one another, laboring  with all our might to build up Zion  and to establish His name in honor  in the earth, that at last we may re-  ceive the reward of the faithful, is   my prayer, for Christ's sake. Amen. 
 ment Associations, and unite to-  gether in these societies, that they   may receive the benefit of the same.    Brethren and sisters, God bless   you. Let us labor with one heart   and one mind, and make our wants  known unto the Lord. Let our  prayers ascend unto the ears of the   Lord of Sabbaoth, and they will be   heard and answered. I know that  if we are blessed, if we are preserv-  ed, and if we are saved, it is and  will be through the mercy and bless-  ing of God. I know also that inas-  much as we will obey His com-  mandments we will receive His   protection and blessing. Zion will   arise. Zion will be clothed with   the glory of God. Zion will   be redeemed. Zion will be prepared  for the coming of the Son of Man.   The Jews will be gathered home to   Jerusalem. And the promises and  prophecies concerning both the   Jews and the Saints of God will all  have their fulfillment in the earth.  My prayer to God is that we may be   true and faithful to the end of  our days, and that we may magnify   our calling as Apostles, Elders and   Saints while we dwell in the flesh.   Amen.

 738 THE DESERET NEWS. Dec. 22    DISCOURSE  BY  ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  Delivered in the Salt Lake Assembly  Hall, at the Priesthood Meet-  ing, Sunday evening July  4th, 1880.    REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.    As this is the priesthood meeting of  the elders of Israel and those bearing   the priesthood, I feel I would like to   say a few words in connection with   what Brother Taylor has said. I look  upon our condition or our position, as  a people, that we are called to a cer-  tain work. When we send men up-  on missions or to perform any branch  of business or labor, of course we ex-  pect them to perform it, and the   Lord expects them to do the same.   Now I look upon the elders of Israel  here to-night and in this Church   and kingdom as upon a mission.   We have been ordained to a mission  and we have our timeset to do it and  to perform it. Not that I know ex-  actly how many days or years we   are going to spend in it. But this   mission is required at our hands, not  at the hands of Brother Taylor, Bro-  ther Joseph, or Brother Brigham   alone, but it is required at our hands  by the God of heaven, and we are  performing a work and laying a foun-  dation which we have got to meet   on the other side of the vail. It does  not make any difference to what   position we are called or ordained.  If we are called to the office of a  bishop we should fulfill the duties  pertaining to that office. I know it  has been considered a very hard  office and one to which a good deal  of time has to be devoted. Yet there   are a great many bishops who don't  spend much time in it, while others  are true to their calling. A bishop's   calling is an important one. He is   called to be a father to the people of  his ward. And when labor is laid  upon us to perform we should not  ignore that labor or lay it aside.  There is an account kept, whether  we keep one or not. There are a   good many revelations which show   us that this is the case. Your his-  tory goes before you. All of you   will find it when you get the other  side of the vail. Every man's his-  tory, his acts are written whether   he has kept a record here or not.   This is plainly manifested in the re-  velation known as the "Olive Leaf."    As I view it we are not placed  here as elders of Israel, apostles, or  bishops, merely to get rich in gold   and silver and the things of this  world. We have a labor laid upon   our shoulders. Joseph Smith had,   Brigham Young had, the Twelve  Apostles have, we all have, and we   will be condemned if we do not fulfill  it. We will find it out when we get   to the other side of the vail. It is   through this neglect of duty that so  many have left this Church and   kingdom of God. There is hardly a   tithe of the people who have been   baptised in water for the remission   of sin that have died in the faith.   In the United States there are tens  of thousands of apostate Mormons.  Many a time in my reflections I   have wished I could fully compre-  hend the responsibility I am under   to God, and the responsibility every  man is under who bears the priest-  hood in this generation. But I tell   you, brethren, I think our hearts are   set too much upon the things of this   world. We do not appreciate as  men bearing the holy priesthood in   this generation should, the mighty   responsibility we are under to God   and high heaven as well as to the   earth. I think we are too far from   the Lord. I do not think we live  our religion as we ought to. I do  not think our hearts are set upon   building up this kingdom as they   should be as Latter-day Saints.   Now, do not think I am your enemy  because I tell you these things. I  feel we have an important work to   perform, and others will continue   the work when we have passed   away. I look around and view the  work of time. I look around and   find that eight of the Twelve Apos-  tles have passed into the world of   spirits since we came into this valley;   I expect to go there myself, I expect  my brethren will, we all shall go   there before many years are over. I  do not look for anything else; and I   will say that for the last year or two   in my reflections I have felt that I   have no other business on this earth   but to try to build up this kingdom.   I do not feel that I am justified in   setting my heart upon the things of   this world to the neglect of any duty  that God requires at my hands.   And another thing when I look at   this generation, when I think of the  twelve hundred millions of people   who dwell in the flesh, many of   them ripening for the judgments   of God, a generation that is ready to   receive the wrath of God upon their   heads—when I consider these things  I know that if I neglect to bear my   testimony before them, if I neglect   to bear my tetimony to this genera-  tion when I have an opportunity, I   shall feel sorry for it when I go into   the spirit world. That is the way I   feel with regard to this work. God   requires that we bear record of it to   this generation; and when I think   of the extent of this generation, the   greatness of it, when I consider that  this is a generation and dispensation   when God has set his hand to es-  tablish a kingdom, the great and  last kingdom, and the only kingdom   that the Lord ever did establish in   any age of the world, to remain on   the earth through the millennium,   when I think of these things I can  realize the greatness of this work.   The Lord never had prophets in any  age of the world who could stand in   the flesh and live and build up the   kingdom of God. The world has   always made war upon them and   destroyed them with the exception   of Enoch who was taken up to heav-  en with his city. Now, if we could   realize that we have the kingdom of   God upon the earth to-day, with the  promise of God our Father that it   will stay upon the earth until the  coming of the Son of Man—if we   could realize this and realize   our responsibility, it seems to  me that we would all have a desire   to magnify our calling.    As I was going to say with a gen-  eration like this, with the nations of   the earth as they are to day, having   the power to build up the kingdom   of God to stay here, having the pow-  er to rear temples to the Most High   God against the wrath and indigna-  tion of a thousand million people—I  say having this power and being   sustained by the Lord, we certainly   ought to be willing to do our part of  the work. We have borne testi-  mony—I have, my brethren have,   the elders of Israel have—to this   generation for many years. We  have borne testimony of the gospel  of Jesus Christ, of the Book of Mor-  mon and of the prophets of God who   have been raised up in this our own   time, and those testimonies will  rise up in judgment against this gen-  eration and will condemn those who   reject them.    This kingdom is in our hands to   bear it off. The God of heaven is   with us. He has sustained us. He  turns away the wrath of man. He  binds the hands of our enemies and   breaks every weapon that is formed   against Zion. He has established   his people in these valleys of the  mountains.    I would say to bishops, and to all   men in authority, we should have  an interest in carrying on this work.   We should labor to get the Spirit of   God. It is our right, our privilege  and our duty to call upon the Lord,  that the vision of our mind may be   opened, so that we may see and un-  derstand the day and age in which   we are living. It is your privilege,   and mine too, to know the mind and  will of the Lord concerning our du-  ties, and if we fail to seek after this,   we neglect to magnify our calling.    As Brother Taylor has said, here   we are at headquarters. We are an   ensample for all the other stakes to   look at. We should not consider   anything we are called to perform a   labor. Anything we are called upon   to do we should do with a will. I   look back to the days of our early   missions. Brother Taylor, Brother   Brigham, myself and others had to  go our ways sick with fever, ague,   and the power of death surrounding   us; had to leave our wives and chil-  dren without food, without raiment,   and go without purse and scrip to   preach the gospel. We were com-  manded of God to do it, and if we  had not done it we should not have   been here to-day. But having done   these things, God has blessed us.  He has sustained the faithful elders   of this Church and kingdom, and he   will continue to do so until we get   through.    I wanted to express my feelings  in relation to these matters. I re-  flect upon our position. I realize   that we have a testimony to bear,  and that we shall be held responsi-  ble for the manner in which we per-  form our duties. As apostles, seven-  ties, elders, priests, &c., we are ac-  countable to the Most High God. If   we do our duty, then our skirts will   be clean. We are watchmen upon   the walls of Zion. It is our duty to   warn the inhabitants of the earth of   the things that are to come, and if   they reject our testimony, then their   blood will be upon their own heads.   When the judgments of God over-  take the wicked they cannot say   they have not been warned. My   garments, and the garments of thou-  sands of others, are clean of the peo-  ple of this generation, as also the   garments of Joseph Smith, Brigham   Young, and those of the elders of   Israel who have died in the faith.   We have borne our testimony, and   when the judgments of God come,  men cannot say they have not been   warned. I consider our position be-  fore this generation is of vast im-  portance to us and them. I do not   want, when I go into the spirit world,   to have this generation rise up and   condemn me, and say I have not   done my duty.    There never was a generation like   this. There has never been a people   like this. There has never been a   work like this since God made the   world. True, there have been men   who have preached the Gospel; but  in the fulness of times the Lord has  set his hand to establish his king-  dom. This is the last dispensation.   He has raised up men and women   to carry on his work, and as I have   often said, many of us have been   held in the spirit world from the or-  ganization of this world until the   generation in which we live. Our   lives have been hid with Christ   in God, and the devil has sought to kill   us from the day we were born until the  present hour. But the Lord has   preserved us. He has given us the   priesthood, he has given us the   kingdom and the keys thereof. Shall  we disappoint our Heavenly Father?   Shall we disappoint the ancient   prophets and apostles who looked   forward to this day? Shall we dis-  appoint Joseph Smith, and those   brethren who have gone before, who   laid the foundation of this work and   left us to labor after them? Breth-  ren, for God's sake do not let us set   our hearts on the things of this   world to the neglect of the things of  eternal life. Do not let the bishops   feel it is a hard matter to carry out   any of the counsels given by those   who are called to direct all these   things. Bless you souls, if you lived  here in the flesh a thousand years,   as long as Father Adam, and lived   and labored all your life in poverty,   and when you got through, if by   your acts you could secure your   wives and children in the morning   of the first resurrection, to dwell   with you in the presence of God,  that one thing would amply pay you   for the labors of a thousand years.   What is anything we can do or suf-  fer to be compared with the multi-  plicity of kingdoms, thrones and   principalities that God has revealed   to us?    Well, we have got the kingdom,   and we must bear it off. It won't  pay you nor me to apostatize. But   then, there is this danger, you know.   Brother Joseph used to counsel us   in this wise: "The moment you per-  mit yourselves to lay aside any duty   that God calls you to perform, to   gratify your own desires; the mo-  ment you permit yourselves to be-  come careless, you lay a foundation  for apostasy. Be careful; understand  you are called to a work, and when   God requires you to do that work do   it." Another thing he said: "In all   your trials, tribulations and sick-  ness, in all your sufferings, even unto   death, be careful you don't betray   God, be careful you don't betray the   priesthood, be careful you don't apos-  tatize; because if you do, you will be  sorry for it." We received a great   deal of that kind of counsel, and I  have remembered it from that day   until the present.    But I do not wish to detain you. I   felt to back up the testimony Brother   Taylor has given. I take it to my-  self. I can make nothing by neg-  lecting any duty. I have never com-  mitted a sin in this Church and   kingdom but what it has cost me a  thousand times more than it was   worth. We cannat sin with impu-  nity; we cannot neglect any coun-  sel with impunity, but what it will  bring sorrow; and the only safe way   is to round up our shoulders and do   our duty, and thus bear off the king-  dom. None of us have a long time   to stay here. When I look around   and reflect upon my brethren that   are gone I ask, where are they?   Where are they gone? Here is   Brother Taylor, myself and others,  who form part of the early organiza-  tion of this quorum, who have trav-  eled with the Church for a great   many years; but Brother Joseph   Smith and others have been gone  for a long time—gone into the spirit   world. While I reflect upon these   things I often ask, what are their   views toward us? How does the  Lord look upon us a people? I   consider the Lord and the heavenly   hosts are watching us. I know they   manifest great interest in our wel-  fare and in the course we pursue. I  do not want to miss salvation. I   want to go where Brother Joseph is.   I want to go to my Heavenly Father,  and to his Son Jesus Christ, and to   the old prophets who lived in their  generations.    Let us try to live our religion. Let   us seek for the Holy Spirit, that it  may dwell in our bosoms day by day.   Bless your souls, we have all we want  of this world's goods. Who ever   saw a people so well off as the people   of Utah in these valleys of the moun-  tains? Who has given us these   things? Our heavenly Father. He   has blessed the land for our use.   This donation that has been made,   some may call it a sacrifice; but   Brother Taylor had a desire to   stretch out the hand of kindness to   the oppressed of the Latter-day   Saints. We want them to have the   benefit of this. We should there-  fore labor with a will. No matter   how long you are a bishop, your   work will be closed in the flesh by   and by. Where are many of the   bishops of this church and kingdom   who held office thirty years ago?   Gone; and the bishops who are here  to-night others will supply their  places by and by. We will all pass  away in our turn, and the faithful  will come forth at the coming of the  Son of Man, which is but a little   while.    I feel anxious that we may not   forget God; I feel anxious that we   may not forget the position we occu-  py before him; for I will say this   concerning myself: if ever I had  any satisfaction or happiness, I have  had it in "Mormonism." If there   is anything to me or about me, it  has been given to me in "Mormon-  ism." If I have ever received any   blessings; if I have ever had power   to testify of the things of God, and   been the means of bringing any into   the church and kingdom of God, it   has been by the power of God, or by   that which is termed "Mormon-  ism," the gospel of Christ. I know   it is the power of God that has ac-  complished these things. It has  been by the power of God that we  have received all we are in possession  of—our riches, our gifts, our wives   and our children. How many of   you have had sealed upon your   heads kingdoms, powers and princi-  palities in the world to come? Who   can compare these blessings with   gold and silver and the things of  this world? Or what is to be com-  pared with the gift of eternal life?    I pray God, our Heavenly Father,   to bless you, to bless all those who  bear the holy priesthood; that the   blessings of God may be over you.  I feel that we as a people have got  to rise up and clothe ourselves with   the power of God. There must be a  reformation, or a change, in our   midst. There is too much evil  among us. The devil has got too  much power over us. A good many   that bear the name of Christ and   the holy priesthood are getting cold  in the things of God. We must   wake up; we must trim our lamps,   and be prepared for the coming of  the Son of Man. May God bless   you. May he guide and direct us   all. May he keep us in the hollow   of his hand. May he sanctify us   and prepare us to inherit eternal   life, is my prayer, in the name of   Jesus. Amen.

WILLARD RICHARDs, President.  DANIEL BROWETT, Clerk. 
 The evening was occupied by elder Hedlock, about one hour, in treating upon  those labours and duties which were necessary for the Saints to enter into for their  temporal and spiritual salvation, which was listened to with great attention; but   he and elder Ward were both called to leave, in the midst of the meeting, in time   to take the train for Liverpool, as their duties called them home; but no sooner   had they started to leave the room than there was a rush of Saints to take the   parting hand with them, that it was with much difficulty they could get out of the   house; the silent but hearty shake of the hand on that occasion spoke in language  louder than words the sentiments of the heart. When the house came to order   the meeting was addressed by the President for a season, and brought to a close;   and for one, I must say, it was, indeed, good to be there; the time seemed too   short while mingling our joys with such spirits in rejoicing in the principles of   eternal truth.    I have every reason to believe that the Manchester Conference, under the super-  intendence of elder Holmes, assisted by elders Miller, Ross, and the many faithful  elders in the various branches, will be much blessed, and bring forth much fruit,  to the praise and glory of God.    I also attended the Bradford Quarterly Conference, in Yorkshire, on the 23rd  February. It was held in the Philadelphia Chapel, North Wing. This is   the conference in which, the worthy elder Lorenzo D. Barnes was presiding   over when he died; it is now in the hands of our beloved brother Elijah F.  Sheets, who, though young, is pursuing the same wise and prudent course that  marked the life of elder Barnes.    I was much delighted in my visit to this conference, elder Sheets presided, good  order generally prevailed, the chapel was filled through the day and evening with   the Saints and citizens. The singers were favoured with a band of music through   the conference, which added much interest to the singing. Many Saints were   present from Idle and Leeds, and I was happy in beholding the unity, order   and peace that bound the Saints together in the Bradford Conference.    The fore part of the day was taken up in representing the branches of the con-  ference and teaching the principles; in the afternoon the sacrament was adminis-  tered, four were confirmed, several children blessed, and the ordinances explained  to the assembly.    In the evening I addressed a large audience on the origin, progress, and prin-  ciples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also gave an account of  the death of the prophet and patriarch, while the hearts of the Saints were made  glad, their countenances beaming with joy: the whole audience listened with the   most profound attention, and a good impression seemed to be made upon the people  through the whole conference.    I also addressed the people on the Monday evening. I had the impression while  there, that good will yet be done in that region. I held one meeting with the   Saints in Idle, and visited the grave of elder Barnes, and spent my time while in   Idle with elder Cordingly and his family, who had the charge of elder Barnes  through his sickness and death; I spared no pains in making all diligent inquries  concerning him during his labours, sickness, and death, in that place. I shall  endeavour to communicate in some future number of the STAR what information   I could obtain upon that subject; I consider it due the Zion Camp, his friends in  America, the quorum to which he belongs, and the whole church in whose love  he shared, that there should be a stone erected over his grave to say to all his friends  that may chance to pass that way, that there sleeps in peace the worthy Lorenzo  D. Barnes, the first member of Zion's Camp or gospel messenger from Nauvoo, who   has found a grave in a foreign land.    And I here take the liberty to say to all the Saints or friends of Elder D. Barnes,   throughout this realm, that inasmuch as they would esteem it a favour to donate  anything for the purpose of erecting a stone over the grave of elder Lorenzo D.  Barnes, that if they will forward it by the presiding elders of their conference, or  some other person, to me, at the General Conference, on the 6th of April next, to   be held in Manchester, I pledge myself that it shall be appropriated for that use.

 with artificial fly. It was the first time I had ever seen this mode of fishing,  and it appeared decidedly the most skilful in the whole routine of fishing. Father   Smithies is seventy years of age, in good health, and as a fisherman is not supposed   to be surpassed in the country. On our return to Clitheroe we visited the old  castle or tower in that place, which appears to have been a very strong hold in its  day.    On Sunday the 11th, I attended the quarterly  Conference at Clitheroe.    Elder Speakman was called to preside. The fore part of the day was taken up   with a representation of the branches; some alterations in the conference, and in   the ordination of one elder, two priests, three teachers, and three deacons. A short  time was also occupied in giving instructions.    In the afternoon we administered the sacrament, after which the Saints were  called upon to occupy the time in bearing testimony to the work of God. The  brethren and sisters followed each other in their testimony one by one, until a con-  siderable number had spoken, and truly the spirit and power of God rested upon  the assembly until they were melted into tears; many wept while bearing their   testimony; it was indeed, an interesting time to us all.    The elder said that when brother Kimball left him, he told him to take good care  of his lambs; he said he had endeavoured to do so, and indeed they had been as  lambs, and as children obedient and willing to hearken to counsel.    While sitting in the midst of the testimony of those loving Saints, I was over-  whelmed with the spirit and power of God, and the simplicity, love, and union of  the Saints who were assembled, I had not power of utterance to express the feel-  ings of my heart, but found myself in tears of joy and gladness. I addressed  the Saints in the evening, and had a full house, and at the dismissal of the meet-  ing, when I was called to take my leave of them, the hearty shake of the hand,  and the flowing tears spoke louder the sentiments of the heart than the words  which accompanied them of "Good bye," and "God bless you!" My prayer to   God is, that he will bless that people and all faithful Saints, and give them a   standing with the sons and daughters of Zion.    I left Clitheroe on the 12th and arrived in Preston in the evening, and had the   privilege of addressing a large assembly of Saints and friends from the ##Psalm 102:16|102nd  Psalm and 16th verse##. I was followed by elder Milton Holmes. We both felt the  spirit of the subject, and had a good meeting. Elder Hardy, the presiding elder   of the conference, was present. Preston was the first place to receive the work  in this country, and it has produced much good fruit, and the Saints there still  have the Spirit of the work.    W. WOODRUFF.    A DAY OF PRAYER AND FASTING.    If the ancient Saints could be benefitted through the principle of prayer and  fasting, so can we, and we think it would be a benefit to us; therefore we feel   disposed to appropriate our time on the 27th of June, for the purpose of prayer and   fasting before the Lord, and we would recommend to all the Saints to assemble   themselves together upon that day and evening, as far as their circumstances will   allow, in their usual places of worship, and offer up their offerings and prayers in   behalf of bleeding Zion. Let your prayers ascend into the ears of the Lord of   Sabaoth in her behalf, that her stakes may be strengthened, her bounds enlarged;  that her watchmen may be sustained and upheld through the mercy of God, that   her widows and orphans, whose husbands and fathers were slain for the word of   God, may be fed, clothed and blessed, and that the temple of the Lord may be  completed according to the pattern given, and accepted of the God of Israel; and   that the elders in the far distant islands of the sea, with all the faithful ones in the   vineyard, may have many souls given them as seals of their ministry, and return to   Zion bringing their sheaves with them.

 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS'  MILLENNIAL STAR.    "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word  it is because there is no light in them."—ISAIAH viii, 20.    No. 36, Vol. L. Monday, September 3, 1888. Price One Penny.    A PIONEER ADDRESS.    THE following address from President   Wilford Woodruff was read before  the assembled Sabbath schools of   Salt Lake City at their celebration   of Pioneer Day:    To the Pioneers and Citizens, and to  the Officers and Members of the  Sabbath Schools.    MY DEAR FRIENDS, Forty-one   years ago this day I passed through   Immigration Canyon with President   Brigham Young. He was taken sick   on East Canyon Creek, and I made a   bed for him in my carriage. When we   came upon the bench, where we had   a fair view of the valley before us, I   turned the side of the vehicle to the   west, so that he could obtain a fair   view of the valley. President Young   arose from his bed and took a survey   of the country before him for several   minutes. He then said to me, "Drive   on down into the valley; this is our   abiding place. I have seen it before   in vision. In this valley will be built   the City of the Saints and the Temple   of our God." I drove down to the   encampment already formed by a por-  tion of our company, who had cut a   road through the quaking-asp groves   of timber which were in the bed of   the canyon and come in ahead of us.   We arrived in the encampment at   11:30 on the morning of the 24th of   July, 1847. The brethren had already   turned out City Creek and irrigated   the dry and barren soil, being the first   irrigation ever performed by any one   in these mountains in this age. They   had also commenced to plough some   ground, and that noble pioneer, Wil-  liam Carter, whose circumstances pre-  vent him meeting with the pioneers   to-day, broke the first ground and   laid the first furrow. The ploughshare   that performed the work is on the   stand to-day. On my arrival in camp,   before I ate my dinner, I planted two   bushels of potatoes in the ground   broken up. President Young com-  menced to recover from his sickness   the hour he entered the valley. On a   day or two following our arrival a   remarkable incident occurred. While   President Young was walking with   several of the apostles on the higher   ground north-west of the encamp-  ment, he suddenly stepped out, struck   his cane into the barren ground and   sagebrush, and exclaimed, "Right   here will stand the Temple of our 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    was the next speaker. He said:  I feel that I want to say to you,  my brethren and sisters, God bless  you. And I feel to bless you. I am   thankful that I have the privilege  of spending a few moments here   and bearing my testimony to the  Church and Kingdom of God here  on earth, backing up the testimony  of Brother Cannon.    The God of heaven has set His  hand to carry out one of His pur-  poses concerning the history of this  world and its inhabitants. In the  formation and creation of the world  the Lord had before Him the whole  history of the children of God, of the  inhabitants of the earth. All men   who have been readers and are ac-  quainted with the revelations of God  in those records that have been   handed down to us, can clearly see   that if God has had a people on the  earth, He has given unto that peo-  ple the Holy Priesthood, the revela-  tions of heaven, and the Gospel of   Jesus Christ. We read in the Rev-  elations of St. John and other por-  tions of the Scriptures, that in the  last days the God of heaven would   set His hand to establish His king-  dom to be thrown down no more for-  ever. [##Revelation 11:15##] [##Daniel 2:44##] You and I have lived to see   that day. The Lord has set His   hand to call forth the children of   men to receive His Gospel and His  Priesthood. There is this one peculiar   principles connected with the King-  dom of God in every age of the   world, and that is, every man and  woman is dependent upon God Him-  self for all the blessings and all the   power that they possess to carry out   His purposes. There is no change  of the Priesthood from eternity unto   eternity. It has dwelt with the God  of Israel from eternity unto eternity,   and will remain unchangeable.  There is no change in the ordinances  of the Gospel of life and salvation.   There never has been; there never   will be to the endless ages of eter-  nity. And whenever that Gospel   has been offered to the sons of men,   the Holy Priesthood has had to be  sent down to aid in carrying out  God's work. There is no man who   ever breathed the breath of life since   God made the world who has had   power to go forth and adminis-  ter in the ordinances of the Gos-  pel of Christ without that Priesthood.  Another thing I wish to say: Al-  most sixty years have passed since  the Church was organized here on  the earth, and the Lord has car-  ried out one peculiar principle, and   that is this—He has chosen the  weak things of the world to con-  found the wise, and things which  are not to bring to pass things   which are. You may begin with   the creation of the world. You   may take all the servants of the  Almighty that the God of Israel   has ever made use of in any age of   the world to carry out His work,   and they have been the weak sons  of Adam; they have been the   weak instruments, from a worldly   standpoint, in the hands of Al-  mighty God. Why has the Lord   chosen that class of men? Because   they have been in a posi-  tion that they were obliged to   acknowledge the hand of God   in all the power they possessed.   Take our own day. Brother Cannon  has referred to this people, to this  Church and Kingdom. He has told  you the truth. When the time came,   in fulfillment of the revelations of  St. John and the ancient patriarchs  and prophets, for Him to establish  His Kingdom on the earth, He raised  up a class of men suitable for the pur-  pose. I will here say, the Lord has   never undertaken to perform any   work, in any dispensation or genera-  tion, without preparing a people for   it. The Lord raised up a young man  —Joseph Smith. His spirit was   kept in the eternal world for six  thousand years, to come forth by  appointment, through the loins of   ancient Joseph and Ephraim, to   stand in the flesh and to establish   this Church and Kingdom. And   he only lived long enough to perform   it. He only lived long enough to   bring forth the record of the Book of  Mormon,—the stick of Joseph in the  hands of Ephraim, and put it with  the stick of Judah, in fulfillment of  the revelations of God; and then go   forth and organize the Church, with  all the instruments, all the knowl-  edge, that all the divines through-  out the world did not have power to   do, neither did they know how to   perform that work. [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##] He was the first  man in the last days that ever organ-  ized a church upon the foundation   of Apostles and Prophets, Christ  Jesus being the chief corner stone,   according to the order as it was   in the days of the Savior. And   when He established this work,   he established it with prophets,   with apostles, with pastors, with  teachers, with gifts, with helps,  with graces, with the Holy Priest-  hood, with the power of God, and   with the ordinances thereof. It is  true, he waded in deep water. It is   true that he was sacrificed. When  he had got the foundation of this  work laid, he himself laid down his   life. He was martyred in a Christian   country for the work of God and the   testimony of Jesus Christ. He was   martyred for his religion. He sealed  his testimony with his blood, as  Jesus and other patriarchs and   prophets sealed the dispensations  in which they lived.    From that day until now, this Church  and Kingdom has continued to grow   and increase. It mattered not what  amount of persecution, what amount   of affliction, what amount of opposi-  tion we had to meet with. That God  who created the heavens and the   earth holds this Church and King-  dom on His hands. And I here say   to my brethren and sisters, the  Church and Kingdom of God is here.  It has come to stay. It has been or-  ganized to stay; and that God who  has organized it will sustain it until   the scene is wound up.    I have been reflecting since sitting   in the stand here, where are our   brethren to whom we have listened   for years and years? Where is Pres-  ident Young? Where is Brother   Kimball? Where are Orson and   Parley Pratt? Where is George A.   Smith? Where is President John  Taylor? And where are all those  other Apostles who have passed   away? They are in the spirit   world, mingling with the Gods, con-  nected with all the patriarchs and   prophets who have ever lived on   the earth. You may ask the ques-  tion: Why is it, then, that God,   with the Savior, with Father Adam,  with Noah, with Enoch, with the   ancient patriarchs and prophets, and  with all the Apostles who have lived   in this day and generation, counsel-  ing together on the other side of the  vail, do not have power to turn   away this persecution that Brother   Cannon has been speaking of?   Jesus told His disciples that if he   were to pray to the Father, He   would give Him a legion of angels  who would come to defend Him; but,  He said, the will of the Father   would not in that way be fulfilled.  So I say to you. If many things that   we might desire in our hearts should  be fulfilled, the work of the Lord   would fail in being consummated.   We should remember that this gener-  ation, like all other generations, have   their own agency. The nation in  the midst of which we dwell today   has its agency. The nations of the  earth all have their agency. All   sects and parties have; in fact, all the  human family. And the God   of heaven will hold them responsi-  ble. He will hold us responsible,   according to the course we pursue.   If we work and fight against God  and the Kingdom of God, we have   got to meet that in days to come.    Brother Cannon has referred to  the situation of men who have   fought against this work. Yes,   brethren and sisters, we have seen  this from the organization of the  Church; we shall see it until the  scene is wound up. But I want to tell   you one thing, and that is, the God   of heaven has not gone to sleep;   neither has He gone on a long  journey; nor has He forgotten His  people. Does He intend to with-  draw His hand? "Leave judg-  ment with me; it is mine, saith the   Lord; I will repay." [##Romans 12:19##] It is our busi-  ness to leave judgment with the   Lord in all these matters. Let us   do our duty.    Joseph Smith said fifty years ago  last June, in speaking of the Priest-  hood—you can read it in the history   of the Church—"Men profess to   prophesy. I will also prophesy. I   say, in the name of the Lord, that   the signs of the coming of the Son   of Man have already commenced in   the earth, and from this time hence-  forth will the judgments of God   be manifest among the nations  of the earth. Wars, blood-  shed, earthquakes, storms, thun-  der, lightning, pestilence, fam-  ine and the judgments of God will  follow in their turn; and when these  things go forth upon the earth, they  will never be returned or withheld   until the work of God is wound up."   Let Israel read, let the inhabitants  of the earth read, with regard to the   signs of the times, and what do you   see? There are a great many things  manifested that the world do not  acknowledge the hand of God in;   but we do and we should. There-  fore I would say to the Latter-day  Saints, it is the will of God that you  should not be discouraged; that you 
 enters the spirit world preached the  gospel there to those who lived after   him; but they all preach to men   who were in the flesh before they   were. Jesus himself preached to   the antediluvian world, who had   been in prison for thousands  of years. So with Joseph Smith and   the elders—they will have to preach   to the inhabitants of the earth who   have died during the last seventeen   centuries; and when they hear the  testimony of the elders and accept   it there should be somebody on the   earth, as we have been told, to at-  tend to the ordinances of the house   of God for them, that they may be   judged according to men in the flesh   and come forth in the morning of   the first resurrection and have a   part therein with us.    These are eternal principles of the   gospel of Christ. We have been   commanded and have been under   the necessity of going forth and de-  claring it to the sons of men. I will  ask by what power have these apos-  tles and elders taken their knapsacks  on their backs, wading swamps and   rivers, and preaching without purse  and scrip, as they have done for   years and years past and gone.   What power has sustained them?  As I have said before, these revela-  tions of God, these great command-  ments and prophecies that have   been given for the last six thousand   years. They have been inspired by   the Spirit and power of God, they   have been commanded to go forth  and warn this generation by preach-  ing the Gospel to them. Here is   President Brigham Young has trav-  eled, as poor as any man could be,  tens of thousand miles, without  purse and scrip, to preach the gos-  pel to the sons of men. So have   his brethren. They have been sus-  tained by the hand of the Almighty,   and if they had not done it they  would have been under condemna-  tion. Why? The angel of God,   who restored the everlasting gospel   to earth, said it must be preached to  every nation, kindred, tongue and   people under the whole heaven, for  the hour of God's judgement had   come. The hour of God's judgment   is at the door of this nation and the  Christian world. Brother Erastus  Snow here, a week last Sunday,   told us about preaching to the dead,   and the judgments that awaited  the nations. Other elders have re-  ferred to the same subject. But sev-  enteen hundred years have passed   without prophets, apostles and pa-  triarchs. The judgments of God   did not rest upon the nations of the   earth during that time as they will   after the proclamation of this gospel.  This message that Joseph Smith   brought to the world involves the   destinies of this whole generation,   not only of this nation, but the   whole Christian and Jewish world,   Zion and Babylon, the whole of it.   They now stand, as it were, warned   of the Lord. The gospel has had to   go to them. We have been obliged   to go abroad to preach the gospel to   the nations; we should have been   condemned, and smitten by the arm  of Jehovah, if we had failed to ful-  fill the revelations given unto us.   It is by that power that President   Young, Joseph Smith, the Twelve   Apostles, and the thousands of   elders of Israel have been moved   upon to go forth and do the work of   God.    Now then, my friends, are we   going to stop here? Are the rest of   the prophecies not to be fulfilled?  Is the Lord going to cut his work in   two, or let the rest go unfulfilled? I   tell you nay, the word of the Lord   is going to be fulfilled, and the Lord   is not going to give this kingdom to  another people. The Lord has rais-  ed up a set of men and women, and   he will inspire and move upon them  to carry out this great work, and we   have got it to do. Zion is going to   rise and shine, and to put on her  beautiful garments; she will be   clothed with the glory of God, and   for brass she will have gold; for iron  silver and for stone iron. All these   revelations touching the last days  have got to be fulfilled. President  Young is moved upon to call upon   Zion to do her duty. Why is he  thus moved upon? Because the   power of revelation surrounds him  and crowds upon him to magnify  his calling and do his duty among   the sons of men. The power of   God rests upon him, and he will  never hold his peace until Zion is  built up and perfected, the house   of Israel gathered and the work of God   performed under his administration   as long as he dwells in the flesh.  He is as much under the power of   God and the revelations of Jesus  Christ as any man that ever breath-  ed the breath of life.    We have got to build this temple.   The Lord requires it at our hands.   We have to pay our tithing—the  Lord requires it at our hands. The  Lord has never said by any revela-  tion that Brigham Young should   build a temple alone, that his coun-  sellors, or that the Apostles or bish-  ops should do it alone. This re-  sponsibility rests upon every man   and woman who has entered into  covenant with the Lord in these   latter days; and if we do not dis-  charge it we shall suffer, the Lord   will chastise us. He is not going to   leave us, and he is not going to take   this kingdom away from the Latter  -day Saints and give it to anybody   else, for they are the Saints, and al-  though mixed like corn in a sieve   among the Gentile nations they  have been prepared from the founda-  tion of the world to come forth as   the sons of Jacob in these latter   days, to build up the Zion of God on   the earth. We have got to come to   it. We must give our earnest sup-  port to co-operation, for it is a step  in advance towards establishing the  Order of Enoch and the building up  of the Zion of God. The servant of  God is moved upon to call upon us  to perform this work, and we have  it to do.    There are some prophecies per-  taining to these latter days that are   unpleasant to contemplate. Presi-  dent Young has been calling upon   the daughters of Zion day after day,  now, for years, to lay aside these   Babylonish fashions. I have been   reading the third chapter of Isaiah  and I have been hoping, all the days   of my ministry, that the sayings   contained in that chapter would  never apply to the daughters of Zion  in our day; but I believe they will,  and inasmuch as they will not listen   to President Young and to the pro-  phets, apostles and elders of Israel  with regard to throwing off these   nonsensical things, I hope they will   hasten the lengthening out of their   skirts and drag them in the streets;   that they will increase their round   tires like the moon, increase their  hoops, and their headbands, in-  crease their Grecian bends at once  and carry it out until they get  through with it, so that we can turn   to the Lord as a people. Some of   the daughters of Zion do not seem  willing to forsake the fashions of   Babylon. I to such would say   hasten it, and let the woe that is  threatened on this account come,  that we may get through with it,  then we can go on and build up the   Zion of God on the earth. But in   spite of the follies that some among   us delight in, we are going to build   up Zion. We are going to fill these   mountains with the cities and peo-  ple of God. The weapons formed   against Zion will be broken, and   the nations of the Gentiles will   visit her and their kings will come   to the brightness of her rising. I   often think when I see gentlemen   and ladies sitting in our tabernacles,   who have come over this great high-  way that has been cast up, whether  they realize that they are fulfilling   the prophecies of Isaiah. I think   this many times in my own mind.   I am satisfied that they do not real-  ize it, but they are fulfilling the rev-  elations of God. The Gentiles are   coming to the light of Zion and   kings to the brightness of her ris-  ing. All these things have been   spoken of and will be fulfilled; and  by and by, when we are sanctified   and made perfect, when we are   chastised and humbled before the   Lord, when we have got our eyes   opened, and our hearts set upon   building up the kingdom of God,   then will we return and rebuild the  waste places of Zion. We have got  this to fulfill in our day and genera-  tion. Then think not, ye elders of  Israel, ye sons and daughters of  Zion, that we are going to live after  the order of Babylon always. We   are not. We shall be chastised and   afflicted, and shall feel the chasten-  ing rod of the Almighty, unless we  serve the Lord our God, and build   up his kingdom, for he has given   us all power; yes, all power is given  into our hands to perform this   work.    Where is the man or the woman  on the face of the earth who can-  not see the hand of God in our de-  liverance until to-day? Every wea-  pon has been broken that has ever   been formed against us. Point me   out an individual or a people who   have ever taken a stand against Jo-  seph Smith or Brigham Young, the   Zion of God or the elders of Israel,  and who have sought to overthrow   this work, but what the curse of   God has rested upon them. Show   me one of that class who has not   gone down to the dust, and as it has   been in days past so it will be in   days to come. Woe to that nation,   kindred, tongue and people under  the whole heavens who war against  Zion in the latter-days; every wea-  pon shall be broken that is formed  against her, and that nation that  will not serve her shall be utterly  wasted away saith the Lord of   hosts. These things are true, and I   would warn Jew and Gentile, saint   and sinner and all the world to be  careful what they do as touching   them.    A few words more to the Latter-  day Saints. I want to say to the  brethren and to the sisters, let us   cease finding fault one with another;  let us not say that this man or this   woman does wrong, this family does  wrong, this person or the other sets   a bad example; let us realize that   we ourselves are held responsible  for what we do. It will do me no   good if I apostatize because some-  body's family follows the fashions   of Babylon, or because some man or   woman or some set of men and   women do wrong. Let us cease   this kind of work, and all of us   look to ourselves. It will do me no   good if I apostatize because I think   somebody else does not do right.   We should lay aside this, there is too   much of it in the Zion of God to-  day, and has been a good while,   finding fault with this, that and   the other, instead of looking at  home. Let us all look at home,   and each one try to govern his own   family and set his own house in   order, and do that which is required   of us, realizing that each one is   held responsible before the Lord   for his or her individual actions   only.    I pray God my heavenly Father   that he will pour out his Spirit  upon the daughters of Zion, upon the  mothers in Zion, upon the elders,  and upon all her inhabitants, that  we may listen to the counsels of   the servants of God, that we may   be justified in the sight of God,   that we may be preserved in the   faith, that we may have power to   build temples, build up Zion, re-  deem our dead, and be redeemed   ourselves, for Jesus' sake. Amen. 
 quorum of the twelve, 1 high-priest, 6 elders, 3 priests, 2 teachers, and 2 deacons. There  were represented 4 branches containing 92 members including 4 elders, 5 priests, 1  teacher and 3 deacons. 6 baptized since previous conference. 2 were ordained to office   of priest, and 1 to the office of deacon, under the hands of elders Woodruff and Hedlock.  The ordinances of confirmation and blessing of children were also attended to. Large  congregations were addressed during the day and evening by the president and elder Hed-  lock, and a good impression apparently made.    W. WOODRUFF, President.  THOMAS SMITH, Clerk.    On our return from the Leamington Conference, we met between four and five  hundred Saints at Birmingham, in a tea-party, at their hall. At the end of the   feast we addressed them at length, and felt that the Spirit of the Lord was in our midst,  to the joy and consolation of our hearts. At the close of the meeting, we met in council  with the officers and spent a season in transacting business and giving teachings and  counsel, which were not altogether unprofitable    W. WOODRUFF.  R. HEDLOCK.    The Carlisle Conference met on the 5th October, when there were represented 5  branches containing 167 members. 6 baptized since last conference, and the prospects,  generally speaking, were favourable. 2 were ordained elders, and 5 were baptized after   the close of the conference. The Saints in Carlisle were rejoicing in the truth, and in a   better state than they had been for two or three years previously.    THOMAS BARTON, President.  ELDER BARKER, Clerk.    The Garway Conference met on the 19th October, there being present, 1 of the seventies,  3 elders, 4 priests, 1 teacher, and 1 deacon. There were represented 5 branches contain-  ing 107 members. 3 elders, 8 priests, 3 teachers, and 1 deacon. 4 baptized since last  conference. Instructions were given by elder Streets and others, and a good feeling prevailed  throughout the conference.    WILLIAM ALLEN, President.  PHILLIP LINES, Clerk. 
 37  THE DESERET NEWS. Feb. 8    DISCOURSE   BY  PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF,  DELIVERED  In the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,  Sunday Afternoon, October  23, 1881.    REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.    THERE being a little time left us   this afternoon, I feel disposed to   make a few remarks to those who   are present. There is one principle  which has been universally acknow-  ledged by the Latter-day Saints, by   Joseph Smith, Brigham Young,   John Taylor, the Apostles and all   the leading men of the Church: I   have heard Joseph Smith and   Brigham Young say that if they   had the power over the whole   world, over every human being who   breathes the breath of life, they   would give every inhabitant of the   earth the right to worship God ac-  cording to the dictates of their own   conscience. This is a principle   which we believe in as Latter-day   Saints, we ever have believed in it,   and it is a principle which even the   laws of our country, the constitution   of our government holds out to all   of its citizens. What! would you   give the Methodist, the Baptists,   etc., the privilege of enjoying their   religion? Certainly. Our city   abounds with churches of different   denominations. Have they ever   been opposed by anybody belonging  to this Church in the erection of   their churches and in the enjoyment   of their religion? I think not. If   they have, they should not have   been. Why would you do this? Be-  cause the God of heaven gives all   His children this right and privi-  lege, it belongs to the whole human   family, every man, woman and   child under heaven has the right to   worship God according to his desires,   according to his own views, and ac-  cording to the light which he has.   The Lord gives all the children of   men this right and privilege. He   gives them their agency and holds   them responsible for their actions,   and while the Lord does this, why   should the children of men inter-  fere? Why those scenes of blood   that have taken place on the earth   through religious principles? They   are unrighteous. As Latter-day   Saints we claim the same right that   we would give to the inhabitants of   all the world. We say to all men,   "Enjoy your religion, worship God   according to the dictates of your   own conscience." We ask the same   right as the children of God. We   claim this by the Constitution and   laws of our country, and upon this   principle we have embraced the   fulness of the everlasting gospel of   Jesus Christ.    The Lord has sent forth angels   out of heaven. He has delivered   the fulness of the gospel to Joseph   Smith. He was raised up as a Pro-  phet of God, by the power of God,   to lay the foundation of this Church   of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints   on the earth, and to lay the foun-  dation of that kingdom which the   Prophet Daniel and the other Pro-  phets spoke of, and to build up that   Zion which Isaiah, Jeremiah and   Ezekiel said should be built up in   the latter days. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] [##Isaiah 60:14##] [##Jeremiah 31:6##] [##Ezekiel 36-37##] We believe this   with every sentiment of our hearts.   Now, in reading the publications of   the day, I find there are many men   in our country that seem to be filled   with great anger against the Lat-  ter-day Saints, and they belch forth  their wrath and indignation and   animus against us, because we dif-  fer from them in some principles   pertaining to the Gospel of Christ.   Now, here is one principle that I   wish to impress upon the minds of   every Saint of God who dwells upon  the earth—and I want our reporters   to write it down—I want to impress  it upon the rulers of our nation and   upon all the inhabitants of this na-  tion and every other nation, name-  ly, that the love of God, faith, hope  and charity, and the gospel of Jesus   Christ with all the ordinances   thereof, with the Holy Priesthood,   which has power both in heaven and   on the earth, and the principles   which have been revealed for the   salvation and exaltation of the   children of men—that these are   principles you cannot annihilate.   They are principles that no combi-  nation of men can destroy. They   are principles that can never die.   Prisons cannot confine them; fire   cannot burn them; the sea cannot   drown them; no storm can wreck   them; no gulf can swallow them up;   no grave can entomb them, because   they are eternal and will endure for  ever. They are beyond the reach of   man to handle or to destroy. You   may put men in prison and abuse   them; you may burn men at the   stake; you may drive men from   their homes who advocate these   principles; but it is not in the power   of the whole world put together to   destroy those principles, they are as   firm and independent, as far as the   agency of man is concerned, as the   pillars of heaven or the throne of   God. I want the inhabitants of the   earth to hear these things and re-  member them. The inhabitants of   the earth have tried for generations   to destroy these principles. Yet it   matters not what may take place on   the earth. Republics may be de-  stroyed, kingdoms overthrown, em-  pires broken up, thrones cast down,  the sun may be turned to darkness,   the moon to blood, the stars may   fall from heaven, and heaven and   earth itself may pass away, but not   one jot or title of these principles   will ever be destroyed. [##Matthew 5:18##] I would to   God the world could understand   this. It would have been a blessing   for them if the Jews could have un-  derstood it before they put to death   the Lord Jesus Christ. When   Jesus Christ came to the Jews He   brought the everlasting Gospel. He   was of the tribe of Judah himself.   He came to his own father's house;   he offered them life and salvation;   yet He was the most unpopular man   in all Judah. The High Priests,   the Saducees, the sectarians of the   day, were the strongest enemies He   had on earth. No matter what he   did it was imputed to an evil source.   When he cast out devils it was im-  puted to the power of Belzebub, the   prince of devils. When He opened   the eyes of the blind they said:   "Give God the praise: we know   that his man is a sinner." [##John 9:24##] This  unpopularity followed the Lord   Jesus Christ to the cross where He   gave up the ghost. Now, the in-  habitants of Judah had an idea that   if they could only put to death the   Messiah that that would end His   mission and work on the earth.   Vain hope of that generation as   well as this. When they led Jesus to   the cross the very moment that   spirit departed from that sorrowful   tabernacle it held the keys of the   kingdom of God in all of its   strength and power and   glory the same as He had   done while in the body. And   while the body lay in the tomb,   Jesus of Nazareth went and preach-  ed to the spirits in prison, and when   His mission was ended there His   spirit returned again to His taber-  nacle. [##1 Peter 3:19##] Did the Jews kill the prin-  ciples He taught? No. He burst   the bonds of death, He conquered   the tomb, and came forth with an   immortal body filled with glory and   eternal life, holding all the powers   and keys He held while in the flesh.   Having appeared to some of the   holy women and the apostles, He   then went and administered to the   Nephites upon this continent, and   from here he went to the ten tribes  of Israel, and delivered to them the   gospel and when they return they   will bring the history of the dealings   of Jesus of Nazareth with them,   while in His immortal body. [##3 Nephi 11##] The   same unpopularity followed the   twelve Apostles. Some of them were   sawn asunder, others were beheaded,   crucified, etc. But did the Jews   destroy the principles they taught?   Did they destroy the keys of the   kingdom of God? No, verily no.   They had no power over these   things any more than they had pow-  er over the throne of God or God   Himself. These men when the   spirit left their body returned hold-  ing the keys of the kingdom of God   into the presence of God.    I will here say in passing that   there is one principle that it would   have been well if the Jews had un-  derstood, it would be well if all the   inhabitants of the earth understood  it, and that is, that it costs some-  thing to shed the blood of the Lord's   anointed, to shed the blood of Pro-  phets and Apostles and righteous   men, to fight against God, against   His Christ, and against His work,   when these Jews cried out, "Cruci-  fy Him, crucify Him," and a Gen-  tile judge had declared He could   find no fault in Him, still they were   ready to say—"All right, you   let his blood be upon us and our   children." [##Luke 23:21##] [##Matthew 27:22-25##] In this the Almighty   took them at their word. The Jews   have been trampled under the feet   of the Gentiles for 1800 years, in ful-  filment of that declaration. The   yoke is not even broken to-day. In   the eastern world, in Russia, and   in all the nations of the   earth more or less they are   trampled under the feet of the   Gentiles. Tens of thousands have   been put to death. Nero put to   death many, as also did other men in   their day and time. Hence you see   it has cost the Jews something for   the putting to death of the Lord's   anointed.    Now, I want to say something   with regard to the dispensation in   which we live. The God of heaven   has set His hand to fulfil the vo-  lume of revelation which the Bible  contains, to build up that kingdom   that Daniel the prophet saw in the  interpretation of the dream of Nebu-  chadnezzar. The God of heaven has   sent forth that angel which John  the Revelator saw "fly in the midst   of heaven having the everlasting   Gospel to preach to them that dwell   on the earth, and to every nation,   and kindred, and tongue, and peo-  ple, saying with a loud voice, Fear   God and give glory to Him, for the   hour of His judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6##]  That angel has delivered the Gospel   to Joseph Smith, and I know it. I   bear my record and testimony to   this truth. It is the truth of the   living God. He has set His hand,   as I have said, to build up this king,  dom. Isaiah has written its history.   Look at these valleys of the moun-  tains. I came here on the 24th of   July, 1847. What did I find? A   barren desert, as barren as   the desert of Sahara. There was no   mark of the white man. It did not   look as if any white man could live   here at all. How is it to-day? Tra-  vel through the length and breadth   of this Territory and behold the   cities, towns, villages, gardens, or-  chards, fields, and crops that cover   this once barren desert. What does   it mean? It means that God Al-  mighty is carrying out His purposes,   it means that He has brought to   His remembrance what His pro-  phets and Apostles have spoken; and   all things shall be fulfilled to the   very letter, even to the winding-up   scene. From whence has come this   congregation; from whence have   come the Saints gathered together   throughout these mountains of Is-  rael? They have been gathered   from every nation as far as the Gos  pel has been preached. We have   been gathered together by the pow-  er of the Gospel. Yet, as I have re-  marked many times in my public   discourses, if we had preached   until we were as old as Methuselah,   we could never have got men and   women to leave their homes if they   had not been moved upon by the   Holy Ghost. The Elders of Israel   preached the Gospel unto them and   promised them in the name of Jesus   Christ that if they would receive   this gospel they would receive the   Holy Ghost. Is there a man on the   face of God's footstool to-day that   would dare make such a promise as   that unless he were backed up by   the power of God? No, not one. If   the Elders of Israel had been impos-  tors, deceivers, they would have   been very soon found out; but the   God of Israel has backed up their   testimony, and it is on this princi  ple that these valleys are filling with   the people of God to-day.    Now, I want to say that the same   principles which existed in the days   of Jesus and His Apostles exist to-  day. There is a spirit of oppression,  opposition, and persecution against  the Latter-day Saints, because they   differ from the world in their princi-  ples of religion. Jesus, however,   said in his day: "If the world hate   you, ye know that it hated me be-  fore it hated you. If ye were of the   world, the world would love its own;   but because ye are not of the world,   but I have chosen you out of the   world, therefore the world hateth   you. [##John 15:18-19##] What is the cause of this   hatred? It is because we declare the   Gospel of Christ; it is because we   believe in Prophets, Apostles, and   the gifts and graces of the Gospel; It   is because we preach faith, repent-  ence, baptism for the remission of   sins, the reception of the Holy Ghost   by the laying on of hands; it is be-  cause the church is organized with   Prophets, Apostles, Priests, Teach-  ers, Deacons, etc., according to the   ancient order of things. This does   not agree with the feelings of the   sectarian world, therefore they are   opposed to us. "But," says one, "it   is your polygamy that has created   so much trouble with you 'Mor-  mons.'" Oh, indeed, is it? I will   ask, where was polygamy when we   were driven from Kirtland and Far   West, from Jackson, Van Buren,   Clay and Davis Counties, Mo., from   Nauvoo, etc., to other places, men   and women put to death, houses   burned, etc.? We suffered more per-  secution then than we have ever   suffered, ten times over, since poly-  gamy was revealed and advocated by  the Elders of Israel. What was the   matter then? "Oh, you believe in   revelation, you believe in prophets  and apostles. We cannot stand this  you have got to give up that belief,   and if you don't we will destroy you,   put you to death, etc." The feeling   among the people of the United   Stetes then was that if they could   only put to death the leaders of the   Church, that that would be the end   of "Mormonism." So they thought   in putting to death Jesus of Nazar-  eth, that that would be the end of   His teachings in that land. But lo   and behold! when they put to death   Joseph and Hyrum, they did not kill   "Mormonism," they did not kill   faith in God, they did not kill hope   and charity, they did not do away   with the ordinances of the house of   God, nor the power of the Holy   Priesthood. The God of heaven had   ordained these things; He had or-  dained men under the hands of   Peter, James and John, who held   the keys of the kingdom of God in   the eternal worlds, and that Priest-  hood and the keys thereof was to re  main on the earth forever. It is   beyond the power of man to destroy   it. I want the Latter-day Saints to   understand this: "Fear not them,"   said the Savior "which kill the body,  but are not able to destroy the soul;   but rather fear him which is able to   destroy both soul and body in hell." [##Matthew 10:28##]  The purposes of the Lord must be   fulfilled. There is not one jot or  tittle of the Old Book that the sec-  tarian world believe in but will be   fulfilled. The same with regard to   the Book of Mormon and Doctrine   and Covenants. The opposition of   the world cannot stay the progress   of this work. Some men are trying  to do so all the time. I dislike to   refer to individuals, but I have read   lately of a Mr. Talmage, who seems   to be in a terrible torment about the   "Mormons," and is forever pouring   out his wrath and indignation   against them. Now, I just want to   say that if we had a thousand mil-  lion Talmage's, and they were to   spend every breath they had they   could no more stay the hand of the   Almighty in the rolling forth of   this work than they could stop the   wind from blowing. Why? Be-  cause God Almighty holds in His   hands the destiny of this people,   and of all nations, and this genera-  tion will yet realize that it is a fearful   thing to fall into the hands of the   living God. "No weapon that is   formed against thee shall prosper,   and every tongue that shall rise   against the in judgment thou shalt   condemn," saith Isaiah, and I know   he was a prophet. [##Isaiah 54:17##]    Now, so far as I am concerned, I   want to say to my friends, and to   all peoples, I have no fears with re-  gard to the kingdom of God; I have   no fears with regard to Zion; I have   no fears with regard to the Church   of Jesus Christ of Datter day   Saints, it is in the hands of the Al-  mighty, and all that He hath said   with regard to its work in the latter-  days will come to pass in spite of   earth and hell combined. I want   the world to understand this. These   are eternal truths. The principles   will live when our nation is broken   to pieces and wasted away, and   when we ourselves have passed   away to the spirit world. There is   no power beneath the heavens that   can hinder, stop or destroy the pro-  gress of truth and the decrees of   Almighty God. I want to have the   Latter-day Saints understand these   things. We are in the hands of   God. This is a very different gene-  ration from any other. It is a gene  ration when the Lord has decreed—  and that, too, before the world was   made—that in the last days the God   of heaven shall set up a kingdom   which shall never be destroyed nor   given to other people; the little stone   cut out of the mountains without   hands shall become a great moun-  tain and fill the whole earth. These   are the declarations of the Lord   Himself.    I will now refer to another princi-  ple. I am an American citizen; a   great many of this people are, I   hope most are. I was born in the   State of Connecticut, and many of   the New England forms and teach-  ings in our childhood, 65 years ago,   were good to receive and live by.   But what I want to say is: We live   in a government raised up by the   God of heaven. We have a consti-  tution that was given by inspiration   from God to man. I believe it is the   best human form of government   that was ever given to the human   family. Now, I say if our rulers   and governors become corrupt and   attempt to trample those principles   under their feet; though the nation   itself might go to piecas, yet it is be  yond the power of man to destroy   the principles of the constitution.   They may destroy one another, yet   the principles contained in that in-  strument will live, and the God of   heaven will maintain them until   Jesus Christ comes in the clouds of   heaven to set up His throne in Je-  rusalem, and to reign on the earth a  thousand years.    I felt that I would like to say so   much. I want my brethren and   sisters to understand these matters.   We should live our religion. I have   no fears with regard to the King-  dom of God. We may have fears in   regard to ourselves. This man may   apostatize, the others may apostatize,   John Taylor, myself, or anybody   else may die, but it will make no dif-  ference with regard to this work.   Israel will never be without a law-  giver. Zion will become all that   Israel saw it, in its beauty, power   and glory in the earth. I wanted to   say so mch to strangers here as well   as Latter-day Saints. We believe   in these principles with every senti-  ment of our soul. We expect to live   them, we are ready to die for them,   but they will never be destroyed.   We may go to prison, we may suffer   all manner of persecution, but the   principles we advocate will remain   forever. When Joseph Smith's   body was laid in the grave, his   spirit, like unto the Son of God, went   into the spirit world with the keys   of this dispensation to unlock the   prison doors. There were fifty thou-  sand million of spirits that never   saw the face of a Prophet, or heard   a gospel sermon in their   lives until Joseph Smith preached   to them the message of salvation.   Those people in the spirit-world   have got to have equal rights in the   Gospel disdensation with those on   the earth. That is the reason why  Jesus went to preach to the spirits   in prison. Joseph Smith will hold   the keys of this dispensation   throughout the countless ages of   eternity, as Peter, James and John   will hold theirs. He (Joseph Smith)   will come forth in the morning of   the first resurrection, and will rise   up in judgment against this genera-  tion. He sealed his testimony with   his blood. That testimony is in   force upon all the world from the   hour of his death. These are eter-  nal truths. I hate to see any na-  tion, I hate to see our own govern-  ment, I hate to see the clergy of the  day rise up in anger against these   Latter-day Saints because they dif-  fer from them in principles of reli-  gion. We know for ourselves this   Gospel is true. We know it has   been given unto us by the revelation   of God. We know it will stand. The   power of God will be made manifest.   These valleys will be filled with   Latter-day Saints. We will grow   and increase until the coming of the   Son of Man. Whatever men may   do, as I have said before, they are in   the hands of God.    I pray God, my Heavenly Father,   that He may instil these principles   into your hearts, that they may ac-  complish the mission for which   they have been sent. Even so,   Amen. 
 Sept. 15 THE DESERET NEWS. 515    ple you can learn and understand  the mind of God. Revelation has  been looked upon by this Church, as  well as by the world, as something  very marvelous. What is revelation?   The testimony of the Father and   Son. How many of you have had   revelation? How many of you have   had the Spirit of God whisper unto  you—the still small voice. I would  have been in the spirit world a great  many years ago, if I had not fol-  lowed the promptings of the still   small voice. These were the reve-  lations of Jesus Christ, the strongest   testimony a man or a woman can   have. I have had many testimonies  since I have been connected with   this Church and Kingdom. I have   been blessed at times with certain  gifts and graces, certain revelations  and ministrations; but with them  all I have never found anything that  I could place more dependence upon  than the still small voice of the  Holy Ghost.    I know this is the work of God. I   know God is with this people. I am   anxious for them. I am anxious for  the rising generation, for the young  men and young women, for I know  this kingdom has got to rest upon  their shoulders. When I see the  evils that exist in Salt Lake City, I  realize they are in danger. Our re-  sponsibilities as parents are great.   We have not only to set an example   ourselves, but we must pray for them,  and counsel them, and I am satisfied  that the Lord will prepare our young  men and young maidens, the sons   and daughters of this people, so that  they will take this kingdom and   bear it off. The kingdom will never  be thrown down or given to another  people.    I thank God I live in this day and  age of the world. I thank God that   I heard the gospel. I thank the  Lord I have been made partaker of  the holy priesthood in connection  with the gospel, and all the fears I  have had have been about myself  and friends. I never had any fears  about the kingdom of God. I do not  have any to-day. I realize and un-  derstand, as well as I know any-  thing, that this kingdom is ordained  to stand. It will grow and increase.   Zion will arise and put on her beau-  tiful garments. The only fears that  I have are with regard to myself, my  family, my wives and my children.  We are surrounded with temptations  which have a tendency to lead us   away. We have got to guard  against them; we have got to in-  crease our faith and live nearer and  nearer to the Lord.    I pray God to bless you and bless  this people, and bless those who   are called to watch over us. We have   got to watch as well as pray. We  have got to guard the Church and  kingdom of God. By and by our   mission will close. We will soon  pass away and shall reap our reward.   We are living in the last dispensa-  tion. Joseph Smith, I expect, will  sound the sixth trumpet. He will   be at the head of this dispensation;  or, if he does not blow the trumpet   of this dispensation, I do not know  who will. Somebody has got to do  it, and it must be somebody holding   the keys of the various dispensations  of the world. No other angels are  coming from any other world to ad-  minister in this dispensation; those   men will minister who dwelt here  in the flesh.    May God bless us and help us to   keep his commandments, for Jesus'   sake.   Amen.

 should have faith in the revelations  of heaven and in those records that   have been left for us and our guid-  ance. Remember your brethren be-  fore the Lord. Be true and faithful   unto this Church and King-  dom of God. It has been   organized and established by the  power of God, and not of man. How  did Joseph Smith have power, as I   have before said, to organize the   Church as it has been organized—  the best organization on the face of  the earth? It is because it was   organized by revelation. How did   these hundreds and thousands of   Elders of Israel, many of whom are  here to-day, have power to go  abroad, without purse and scrip,  and preach the Gospel to the convincing   of the sons and daughters of Adam?  It has been done by the power of  God. No Elder in this Church has  had power to go forth and do the   will of God only by the power of  God. If we have any power, it is  of God, and we should trust Him   with regard to all things.    Brethren and sisters, do not be   discouraged. The Kingdom of God   is established here in these valleys   of the everlasting hills. These are  the valleys and these are the moun-  tains given by our father Jacob to   his son Joseph—the utmost bounds  of the everlasting hills, promised  unto Joseph, who was separated   from his brethren, and whose sons  and daughters ye are. Let us be  faithful. Let us try to do our duty.  Let us endeavor to honor God. We  have a long eternity before us. We  have a great future before us. Zion   will arise and shine, and the glory of  God will rest upon her. Israel will  be gathered, Jerusalem will be re-  built, Zion be established and thrown  down no more forever. These  things are in the record of divine  truth. Not one of them will ever  fail of fulfillment. They were given   by revelation. No matter what  the feelings of our enemies may  be. No matter what the feeling may   be of those who differ in prin-  ciple from us. They have the right   to their own religion, and we have  no right to disturb them. But if   they war against God, against His   Zion, against His people, they have   got to pay the bill, the same as we  have for the deeds done in the body.   This nation will be held responsible  for the course they have pursued  towards the Zion of God. It has  always been to me one of the  strongest evidences—and it should   be to all Latter-day Saints, if not to   the world—the fact that all earth and   hell, if I may be allowed to use such   an expression, have been combined   against this Church from the day   that Joseph Smith brought forth the  Book of Mormon and organized this   Church with six members. Why is   this? Would this opposition have  been if it were not the Kingdom of   God? It would not. For that rea-  son the powers of darkness are   stirred up. Darkness covers the   earth, and gross darkness the minds  of the people. The judgments of  God are in the land, and the day   will come when the nations will   learn and understand that there is a  God in Israel.    I bear my record and my testi-  mony that this is the work of God.   The Lord has called us here; and   we should not forget Him. We   should not forget our prayers. Go   before the Lord and make our wants   known, and He will hear our pray-  ers and sustain us in carrying out   this work until the scene is wound  up.    I pray God to bless you and  clothe you with the Spirit of   God. What a responsibility it   is to hold this heavenly, this  eternal, this everlasting Priest-  hood? And we shall have to   give an account of it. Apostles,   Seventies, High Priests, Elders, and   all men who bear any portion of this   Priesthood that has been given unto  us, will be held responsible for it un-  til our spirits return unto God who  gave them.    I marvel sometimes, when I re-  flect, why I am alive. I was going  to say that there is not a man liv-  ing, scarcely, that I was acquainted   with in Kirtland. A whole quorum   of Apostles has been taken into the   spirit world. But for some reason   the Lord has preserved my life un-  til the present day. And I sincerely  desire, in the remaining days I have   to spend here, that I may do what  little good I can. I wish to magnify  my calling. I wish to do my duty.   I wish to know the mind and will  of God, and try to do it. I pray not  only that these blessings may be  given to me, but to all the Elders of  Israel and the Latter-day Saints,   which may God grant, for Christ's  sake. Amen. 
 God." We had a peg driven down,  and it was nearly in the middle of the  Temple as it stands to-day, which   Temple was built without any regard  to the spot designated by President   Young at the time. On the 26th we  went to the top of a high point on the  north of the city, which President   Young named "Ensign Peak." We   also visited the Hot and Warm   Springs. On the 27th we drove to  the West Mountains, and visited the  Salt Lake, President Young being the  first man to dip his hand into the  briny water. We walked dryshod to   the Black Rock and took a bath in  the lake. Afterwards preparations   were made for laying out the city, and   I with other brethren, assisted Presi-  dent Young in laying out the ground   and streets with chain and compass.   He laid out a block of ten acres upon   which to build a Temple, and city  lots of one acre and a quarter, and  streets eight rods wide, all of which  have been published by historians.  President Young left Winter Quarters   on the 7th day of April, accompanied  by seven other apostles and other men   all told 143 men and three women.   The apostles were Brigham Young,  Heber C. Kimball, Wilford Woodruff,   Geo. A. Smith, Willard Richards,   Orson Pratt, Amasa Lyman, and Ezra  T. Benson. Parley P. Pratt and John   Taylor arrived soon after, leading  companies of families. Orson Hyde  remained at Kanesville. We traveled  the first 500 miles without any grass.   With the exception of the little grain  we fed our animals, they lived entirely   on the bark of cottonwood limbs and   saplings which they knawed from the   cottonwood we would lay before them   for their night's meal. This company  of 143 men traveled 1,000 miles,   making their roads and building their  bridges. In one instance we had to   form a guard of a wedge shape for   three days and nights to keep our  company from being trampled to   death by an enormous herd of buffalo  that had gathered from the mountains  and were migrating in a solid body to  the plains below. The herd was judged   to be sixty miles in length, and   numbered not less than one million.  They were traveling east, and we were  traveling west. We were three days   passing through the herd, and we all  breathed freer when we were clear of  them. No other class of men will   ever witness the same scene again  upon the face of the earth. Brother   Wm. C. A. Smoot, sen., got his horses  loose and mixed with the herd, and it   was with great difficulty that we ob-  tained them again.    Notwithstanding our first care was   to secure an abiding place, a home for  the people, we did not lose sight of   other important matters. President  Young contemplated at that early day   the building of a railroad across the  continent, and we marked out the  route which we thought the national   road would take to unite the Atlantic   and Pacific Oceans.    Brothers Orson Pratt and Erastus  Snow entered the valley two or three   days before the body of the pioneers;  but where are those men to-day, and  where is President Brigham Young   and the apostles who accompanied   him? All are in the spirit world,   mingling with the martyred prophets,  where they can plead for their breth-  ren. Not one of them living to-day   except myself, and but few of the   pioneers remain. We have buried a   whole quorum of twelve apostles since   we entered these valleys of the moun-  tains. The remnant of Zion's Camp,   Mormon Battalion, and the pioneers,   number but very few to-day. Those  of us who remain will soon pass away,  but our posterity lives and are num-  bered in the Primaries, the Sabbath  Schools, and the Mutual Improve-  ment Associations, and are this day  assembled in this great Tabernacle to  celebrate the arrival of the pioneers  into this great American desert, which   to-day, through the blessing of God  and labor of the pioneers, is blossom-  ing as the rose.    This company of pioneers spent about  a month in this valley, during which  period we erected what is known as   the Old Fort, surrounding three sides   of the ten-acre block with an adobe  wall on the outside, and the east side  with log cabins. We also arranged for  this fort to have four entrances, one   on each point of the compass.    Most of the pioneers returned to   Winter Quarters, where they reached   in the fall, making a journey of over 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 491    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  said: I feel thankful that I have   lived and had the privilege of at-  tending this fifty-ninth annual con-  ference of the Church of Jesus   Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is   nearly fifty years since I was or-  dained into the Quorum of the   Twelve Apostles, and the Lord has   told us while occupying these posi-  tions and holding the keys of the   Kingdom of God, that whomsoever   you bless shall be blessed, and whom-  soever you shall curse shall be   cursed. I have never seen a mo-  ment in my life since I have been a   member of this Church and King-  dom when I felt like cursing any-  body, and I would not wish to do so  unless I was commanded of the   Lord. I have had a desire to  bless my friends, and at this time,   when I have the right and   privilege, I feel to bless my breth-  ren, my counselors, my brethren of   the Twelve Apostles; and I feel to  bless in the name of the Lord also   the Patriarchs, Presidents of Stakes,   the High Councilors, and those who   bear the Holy Priesthood, even the   High Priesthood throughout the   land of Zion. Likewise the Seven-  ties, Elders of Israel who are called   as messengers to the nations of the   earth, the Bishopric, the lesser   Priesthood, and all the Saints of   God who dwell in our midst. I feel   to bless the Primary Associations—  our little children; I feel to bless   the Sabbath schools, the teach-  ers and pupils; the Mutual   Improvement Associations, the   Relief Societies, and all those or-  ganizations which have been estab-  lished by the hand of God and by  His power, His helps in the build-  ing up and establishing of the   Church and Kingdom of God on   the earth. All these I feel to bless  in the name of Jesus Christ and by   virtue of the holy Priesthood, even  so, Amen.    Brother Woodruff then pro-  nounced the benediction. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.    I do not know that I can make   this congregation hear me, but I  would like to make a few remarks.    I will say that if this whole as-  sembly could have their eyes opened   to behold all the creations of God—  the beasts of the field, the fowls of   the air, the fish of the sea, and the   fourteen hundred millions of people   that inhabit this world, with every   spear of grass and every flower—it  is said you could find no two things   alike. This has been represented   many times by men concerning the   creations of God. This eternal   variety on the earth is no greater   than that among the spirits who   have dwelt in the presence of God   in the eternal worlds and who have   taken and will take tabernacles on  this earth. This variety has also been   manifest in all the revelations that   have been given to us concerning the   children of men or the creations of   God. So great has this variety been   that it seems Lucifer, the son of the  morning, a personage who was great  in the presence of God, rebelled   against God and drew away with   him one-third of the whole host of  heaven. They deserted the Lord   and followed Lucifer. And I do   not know how many were "astride   the fence" and did not know   which way to go; but I presume   there were a good many of them.   This variety has remained with the   spirits in heaven and on the earth.   The Lord revealed this principle to   Father Abraham. He showed unto   him the spirits that dwelt with Him  and told Abraham that many of   those spirits were more noble than   others, and said unto him: "These   I will make my rulers; for he stood   among those that were spirits, and   he saw that they were good." He   also said to Abraham, "Thou art one   of them, thou wast chosen before thou   wast born." And the Lord blessed   Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the  twelve tribes of Israel, who sprang  from Jacob. They all received their   patriarchal blessings, and every one   of those blessings has been fulfilled   to the very letter as fast as the time   would permit. From that day un-  til the present the Almighty has   made use of the seed of Abraham,

 560  THE DESERET WEEKLY.    DISCOURSE  Delivered by President Wilford Wood-  ruff, at the General Conference,  Sunday after noon, Oct. 6. 1889.    The following passage from the  sixty-eighth section of the Doctrine  and Covenants was read by Presi-  dent George Q. Cannon:    My servant, Orson Hyde, was called  by his ordination to proclaim the ever-  lasting gospel, by the Spirit of the  living God, from people to people, and  from land to land, in the congrega-  tion of the wicked, in their synago-  gues, reasoning with, and expounding  all Scriptures unto them.    And behold, and lo, this is an ensam-  ple unto all those who were ordained  unto this Priesthood, whose mission  is appointed unto them to go forth;    And this is an ensample unto them,   that they shall speak as they are   moved upon by the Holy Ghost,    And whatsoever they shall speak   when moved upon by the Holy Ghost,  shall be scripture, shall be the will of  the Lord, shall be the mind of the   Lord, shall be the word of the Lord,  shall be the voice of the Lord, and the  power of God unto salvation:    Behold this is the promise of the  Lord unto you, O ye my servants.    President Woodruff then said: I   have traveled over one hun-  dred and fifty thousand miles   preaching the Gospel to large  and small congregations, to saints   and to sinners; and I have  never yet seen the day, on arising to  my feet, that I have known what I   was going to say to the people. And   this is the case with the Elders gen-  erally in their ministrations. You  who have attended the meetings of  this Conference perceived that we  called upon brethren from the right  and left to speak to us; and if you  have any discernment you certainly  can testify that they spoke by the  Spirit and power of God.    I have attended Conferences dur-  ing my whole life, in company with  the Prophet Joseph, Oliver Cowdery,  the witnesses of the Book of Mor-  mon, with the first Twelve Apos-  tles, all of whom are in the spirit  world, mingling with the Gods; and  I have never attended a Conference  when I have felt better and been  more edified in listening to the re-  marks of the same number of men,  than at this Conference. The Elders  have spoken by inspiration, and   they have declared unto us  eternal truths. As I said last night  at our Priesthood meeting so I   would remark here, no man that   God ever made, beginning with  Father Adam down through the  history of the world, that has ever  been called to build up the King-  dom of God, and preach the Gospel,  has been able to perform that work  only by the Power of the Holy  Ghost; neither can any man do it   today.  We are all dependent upon  the Holy Ghost. And what is the  Holy Ghost? The testimony of the  Father and the Son. It is one of  the God-head—God the Father, God  the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.   Will the Holy Ghost deceive any  man? It will not. When a man   speaks as he is moved upon by the  Holy Ghost, it is the spirit of in-  spiration; it is the word of God; it is  the will of God. It cannot lie; it   cannot deceive. It leads into all   truth and reveals to man the will of  his Maker.    Jesus instructed His disciples to   take no thought what they should  eat, or what they should drink.   They were traveling without purse  or scrip, as many of us have done   in our time. The Lord knew they   would have need of something to  eat; and He knew that somebody  would be raised up to supply their  wants. He also instructed them to  take no thought what they should say  when having to appear before magis-  trates and rulers; for the same   should be given them the hour it  was needed.    This is the condition of the Lat-  ter-day Saints. The Apostle has said,  "He hath chosen the weak things   of the world to confound the things  which are mighty; * * *  and things which are not, to bring   to naught things which are." This  has been the case in the dealings of  God with man of all ages; and it   certainly is the case in this our day.    When I look upon the ten thou-  sand faces of Latter-day Saints be-  fore me the present time; and when  I contemplate what God hath   wrought in establishing this people  in the midst of these mountain val-  leys; and when I bring myself   face to face with the wonderful age   we live in, and sense   the mighty responsibilities that rest  upon us, as watchmen upon  the walls of Zion, and as   watchmen to this generation—when  I contemplate these things, if any  man under heaven feels his weak-  ness, it is Wilford Woodruff. And   in saying this of myself, I know I  am expressing the feelings of my  brethren associated with me in ref-  erence to themselves, as Counselors,  as well as the sentiments of the  Twelve respecting themselves, and  those of every Elder of Israel who   appreciates his calling in Christ  Jesus.    We have been called from the   plow, the plane and the anvil, and  the various avocations of life; and  without preparation the Elders of   this Church are sent forth, by com-  mand of Almighty God, to preach   to and warn the nations of  the earth. Joseph Smith has   been referred to by some of the  speakers, and their testimony   of him is true. A greater prophet  than he, excepting Jesus Christ, I  do not believe ever lived. In saying  this I give it as my own personal   views. I don't believe God ever   raised up a greater prophet, save  Jesus himself. The dispensation he  was called to usher in is the great-  est ever given to man; and it re-  quired just as much a man to stand at   the head of it—a man who was true   to God and his brethren; who was a  seer and revelator, and whose faith  in God was such that he never   wavered or doubted, but persevered  himself and encouraged others to   move forward in the great work be-  fore them. The world called him  illiterate and ignorant. However  they might regard him, our testi-  mony of him is that he   was taught of God Himself   and of the angels who visited   him; and that he fulfilled certain  revelations and predictions referring  to this age, as contained in the Bible  and other records of Divine truth.   And, as has been stated during this  Conference, he brought forth the   Book of Mormon—the stick of Joseph  in the hands of Ephraim—in fulfill-  ment of the testimony of Isaiah,   translating that record through the  Urim and Thummim, thereby reveal-  ing to us the history of the early in-  habitants of this Continent. That book   informs us that two distinct nations   inhabited this land, the founders of   both of which were brought here by  the power of God from the eastern  continent, the first, known after-  wards as the Jaredites, tracing their  origin to the tower of Babel. They 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    President George Q. Cannon then  presented the authorities to be voted  on by the general assembly, as  follows:    Wilford Woodruff, as Prophet,  Seer and Revelator and President  of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints in all the world.    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  arose and spoke as follows:    I wish to say to this assembly of  Latter-day Saints that there are  three vacancies in the Quorum of the  Twelve Apostles, in consequence of  the organization of the First Presi-  dency. We have felt that it is time  to fill that quorum now, at this con-  ference, and the people should be  prepared for the presenting by the  Twelve Apostles of such names as  they may feel by the Spirit of God  to be worthy and proper persons to  receive this ordination or to occupy  this position. These Apostles are  Prophets, Seers and Revelators. I  have confidence in them; I believe  they have power to present such  things as would be in accordance  with the will of God. They (the  Apostles) presented to me a list of  names. I wish here to say, and  I want it understood, that neither  myself, President George Q. Can-  non nor President Joseph F. Smith,  who are my counselors, pre-  sented any of these names. We left  it with the Quorum of the Apostles.  I became thoroughly satisfied that  they had upon that list such names  as would be acceptable unto the Lord.  We took those names and made it a  matter of prayer, and the Spirit of  the Lord manifested unto me those  whom we should appoint. They  have all been accepted by the  Quorum of the Apostles as well as  the Presi[d]ency of the Church. I  have a reason for making these re-  marks.    After President Woodruff had  taken his seat, President Cannon re-  sumed the presentation of the au-  thorties, submitting the names of  the following three brethren for ap-  pointment to the Apostleship, to fill  the three vacancies in the Quorum  of the Twelve before referred to:    Mariner W. Merrill, Anton H  Lund, Abraham H. Cannon.    Counselors to the Twelve Apostles  —John W. Young and Daniel H.  Wells.    The Counselors in the First Presi-  dency and the Twelve Apostles, with  their Counselors, as Prophets, Seers  and Revelators.    Patriarch to the Church: John  Smith.    First Seven Presidents of the   Seventies: Henry Herriman, Jacob   Gates, Seymour B. Young, C. D.  Fjeldsted, John Morgan and B. H.  Roberts.    Wm. B. Preston as Presiding  Bishop, with Robert T. Burton as  his First and John R. Winder as his  Second Counselor.    Franklin D. Richards as Church  Historian and General Church Re-  corder.    John Jaques as Assistant Church  Historian and General Church Re-  corder.    As the Church Board of Educa-  tion: Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo   Snow, George Q. Cannon, Karl G.   Maeser, Willard Young, George W.   Thatcher, Amos Howe, Anton H.   Lund, James Sharp.    Joseph Don Carlos Young, as  General Church Architect.    John Nicholson, as Clerk of the  Conference.    The vote upon each of the persons  named for the positions specified  was unanimous. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    443    PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S ADDRESS TO THE OLD FOLKS.    IT is an established custom in Salt Lake City to give the old folks, those   over seventy years of age, an outing each year, and entertain them with   songs, speeches and refreshments. This year they were given a two days'   outing, consisting of a trip to Saltair, a grand pavilion on the Great Salt   Lake, some twelve miles from Salt Lake City, and a ride to Fort Douglas,   a military post adjoining the city. Besides this, a concert was held for   their entertainment in the Tabernacle, on June 22nd.    President Wilford Woodruff, one of the few who has passed the ninetieth   milestone of life, was on the program for an address, but being the sufferer   from a bad cold, his address was a prepared one which was read by Elder  David McKenzie. It was as follows:    "My Dear Friends—I thank God that I have lived to see this day. I   rejoice to behold the faces of so many of my friends gathered together in   this great Tabernacle. We who have been upon this earth from seventy 
 Isaac and Jacob, in a great measure,   to perform His work on the earth.   Jesus Christ Himself, the Son of   God and the Savior of the world, was   a literal descendant of Abraham,  through the loins of Judah. [##Matthew 1:1-16##]    I will here say a few words in re-  ference to the Prophet Isaiah. Isai-  ah spoke and prophesied upon a  very broad ground. In speaking of   the judgments of God which were  to come upon great Babylon and   the raising up of Cyrus to destroy   Babylon, in fulfillment of the prom-  ises which had been made, and also   in speaking of the destruction of the   wicked and their cities, he says:   "But Israel shall be saved in the   Lord with an everlasting salvation;  ye shall not be ashamed nor con-  founded world without end." [##Isaiah 45:17##] That   was the promise of God to Israel.   And all the judgments of God that   have ever followed Israel from the   days of Father Abraham to this   hour have come upon them through   transgression.  The Jews caused   Christ to be put to death, against  the judgment of the Gentile judges   who were in their midst. [##Matthew 27##] Moses   told the Jews what would follow   them. Jesus Christ did likewise. The   Apostles also warned them of the  evils that would come upon them   if they turned away from the com-  mandments of God. These things   have been fulfilled to the very let-  ter. For eighteen hundred years   the Jews have been trampled under   the feet of the Gentiles, and the  yoke is upon them today. But the   Rothschilds and other rich Jews are   returning to rebuild Jerusalem, in   fulfillment of the words of the an-  cient prophets.    Whenever and wherever God has  raised up prophets or a people, no   matter who they were, the evil   spirits, who are very numerous,   have always sought to kill them.   You cannot point me to a prophet or   an apostle who has ever lived on   the face of the earth that was popu-  lar in his day. The people have   always fought them. Jesus Christ   certainly was a good man. He was   the Savior of the world. He com-  mitted no sin; yet all Jerusalem and   Judea and the surrounding country   were opposed to Him and fought   Him until they put Him to death.    I now say to the Latter-day Saints,   you are of the house of Israel. Nearly   all of you are of the tribe of Ephraim.   You have been a mixed cake among   the Gentiles. The Gospel of Christ   found you and you have received it.   You have been gathered to these   valleys of the mountains. The Lord   chose Joseph Smith to establish this   Church and kingdom. He brought   forth the blessings of the Gospel. He   received the holy Priesthood from  the angels of God. That Priesthood   has been given to you. Why? You   are the descendants of Israel, and   God has called you and placed upon   you this work, to warn the genera-  tion in which you live, and if you   do not do it, you will be under con-  demnation. But are we popular?   No. Shall we ever be? No, not   in the generation in which   we live. The Lord has chosen   these Apostles and Prophets and   Elders of Israel and laid upon them  the holy Priesthood, and we have  been called to go forth with the ful-  ness of the everlasting gospel and   warn this generation. If we had not   done it, we would have been under   condemnation and the curse of God   would have rested upon us.    Latter-day Saints, you have no   time to be divided. You have no   time to forsake the Lord. You   have no time to depart from doing   the works of righteousness. If you   do, the afflictions of the Lord will   rest upon you, as they rested upon   Israel in former days. The revela-  tions of God declare this. The Bible   declares that in the last days   the God of heaven would set His   hand to gather His people and to   establish His Church and Kingdom,  that Mount Zion might be built up   and His People stand in holy places   while His judgments overtook the   world.    We are here today. We profess   to be Latter-day Saints, and we hold   the Holy Priesthood. What Brother   Geo. Q. Cannon has said to you is  true; you have never seen a day,   you never will see a day, in time or  in eternity, when you can get be-  yond the need of the protection and   care of God. You need it all the   way through your lives. When our   young men, or our old men, or our   maidens, feel that they have arrived   at a point that they are independent   of the Lord, they will find that they   are greatly mistaken. We are all   here upon a mission. That mission   is to build up Zion and to preach   the gospel and warn the inhabitants   of the earth of the judgments of   which the heavens are full, and   which are about to be poured out   upon the earth. It is the lot of this  congregation and of all people who   now dwell on the face of the earth  to live in the last day and generation  before the coming of the Son of Man,  in the which will be fulfilled the  promises of God concerning the   winding up scene, the pouring out   of the plagues, the opening of the   seals and all those judgments   which are to be poured out. These   things will surely come to pass,   in spite of all efforts of earth and   hell. Therefore, I say, honor and   serve God, and keep His command-  ments. We shall soon go to the   other side of the veil, where other   generations have gone before us—  the rich and the poor, the saint and   the sinner, the president, the em-  peror, the king, the judge, and all  other men. We have been sent here   upon a mission; and when you and   I get through we will read our his-  tory; it will be before us, and it will   be before the Great Judge, who will   decree righteous judgment upon all  flesh.    This is our condition today. I   know this is the work of the Lord.   I know the Lord has raised up a   Prophet. I know He has given   unto this Prophet and unto His   servants, the Holy Priesthood,   which is the power of God to ad-  minister in all the ordinances of   life and salvation, both for the liv-  ing and the dead. We are held re-  sponsible for the use we make of   this Priesthood, and for the use we   make of the blessings which God  has given unto us. Therefore,   brethren and sisters, let us look   around ourselves. We have not   yet got beyond the dictation   and direction of the Lord. He is   God, and there is none else. He  created this world. He created it to  be occupied by His children. But   this eternal variety is here. Some   men want to commit murder; some  delight in doing all manner of   wickedness and abomination; while   others do not take pleasure in this   and look upon it as wrong. This  has been so from one generation to   another. These evil spirits are   with us, and they make war against  the Church of Christ and against   the Priesthood: and our help, our   sustenance, our defense, our refuge,   and our salvation is in the God of  Israel. As Brother Cannon has   said, it is our duty to make our   wants known there. If we do not   do our duty, if we stray from the   commandments of God, we shall be   chastised.    I pray God that those who have   entered into covenant with the Lord  and with one another will not forget   their position; that they will not   forget why they are here and where  they came from, nor forget their   duty to God and to one another. I   pray God to bless us all, and to give  us His spirit to guide and direct us   through our mission and probation  here in the flesh, that when we   come into the presence of God and   the Lamb and of those old patriarchs  and prophets, and of our brethren  and sisters who have lived in this   generation and have passed away,   we may be satisfied with our lives   and with our work and labor here,   which may God grant, for Christ's   sake. Amen. 
 2,000 miles, besides the labors per-  formed while here in building a fort,   laying out the city, and exploring the  adjacent valleys.    I wish to say a few words to the  members of the Sabbath Schools, and   to all who are assembled in this Taber-  nacle to-day to celebrate the arrival   of the pioneers into this valley. It is   not wisdom for us to occupy your time  with a long address upon an occasion   of this kind; but I have referred to a  few incidents of our peculiar journey  into this barren desert, that you can  keep in mind the toil, the care, and  the hardships which your fathers en-  dured in laying the foundation of the   Zion of our God which is to be estab-  lished in the mountains of Israel in   fulfillment of the blessings the old   Patriarch, Jacob, pronounced upon   his posterity that should be fulfilled   in the valleys of the everlasting hills  in the latter days; and upon the  heads of the rising generation of the  Latter-day Saints rests the responsi-  bility of building up the kingdom of   God upon the foundations which their  fathers have laid. And also of build-  ing up a State in which shall dwell  virtue, temperance, industry, frugality,   and honesty; a State which will do   honor to the American Government,   where wholesome laws shall be ad-  ministered in equity and justice to all   of its citizens according to the letter   and spirit of the Constitution given  by inspiration of Almighty God to   our forefathers.    I feel to say to our children, honor  your father and your mother and your   God, that your days may be long and  prosperous in these valleys of the  mountains which the Lord your God  hath given unto you.    That God may bless you all, and   enable you to fulfill the object of your   creation here on earth to the satisfac-  tion of yourselves and your Creator,   is the earnest desire of your friend  and brother,    WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  561    flourished and became a mighty  people; but they turned from the   right way of the Lord, and when  they had ripened in iniquity they,   like other nations of the earth, were  finally destroyed by the judgments   of God. The other nation was   known as Nephites and Lamanites,   being named after the sons of Lehi,  the head of the family who, by  command of God, left their native  land, Jerusalem, some four hun-  dred years before Christ, and tra-  veled by land, and in ships   of their own construction, crossed  the great waters, and came   to this land. They dwelt here   for hundreds of years, and also be-  came a great and mighty people,   an outline of whose history is re-  corded in that book. The interest-  ing mission of the Savior to the  people of this continent is also re-  corded here; the establishing of the   Church among the believing Ne-  phites, and their labors in the work  of perfection. And I may say the   remains of some of the cities built  by these peoples have been dis-  covered and written about by such  men as Stephens and Catherwood   and others; and doubtless much re-  mains yet to come to light in corrob-  oration of the testimony of this   divine record.    The Prophet Joseph not only per-  formed this work, but organized the   Church with prophets and apostles,   elders, priests, teachers and deacons,   as it was organized in the days of   Jesus and His Apostles. And there  is a feature connected with the  Church as it exists today that is pe-  culiar from all other dispensations  that we have any account of; that   is, nearly the whole body of its male   members have received some portion   of the Priesthood, until we have to-  day in these mountains some twen-  ty thousand men bearing either the  Priesthood after the order of Aaron   or Melchizedek. There is a reason  for this. There never has been a  time in all the dispensations of God   to man, when there has been so  much need for the labors of the ser-  vants of God as in this our day; and  the Lord, therefore, has called a  great number of men to bear the   Priesthood, and directed them to go   unto all nations, tongues and peoples,   as He showed John the Reve-  lator He would do in the last days,   as recorded in the ##Revelation 14|14th chapter## of the  book of Revelations. And in ful-  fillment thereof we have not only   gone forth to the nations proclaim-  ing this Gospel revealed to man by  the angel of God, but in further   obedience to the divine command,  have come out from Babylon, until  we number some two hundred thou-  sand gathered here. And by what   power have we come here? And  why did you leave the States of   this nation, England, Scotland, Ire-  and, Wales, Norway, Sweden, Den-  mark, Austria, Germany and other  nations? You heard the Elders.   They told you they had been sent   by God and that they had the ful-  ness of the Gospel to offer to man,   and they explained to you the prin-  ciples thereof. They told you there  was but one Gospel, and that God   had never revealed but the one, the  Gospel that Paul referred to when  he said, "Though we, or an angel   from heaven, preach any other Gos-  pel unto you than that which we   have preached unto you, let   him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8-9##] You be-  lieved and obeyed, and gathered  with the Saints. And what   was it these Elders taught  you? It was that you must have   faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of   God; that you must repent of your   sins and be baptized by immersion   for remission of the same, and then  have hands laid upon your head for  the reception of the Holy Ghost.  And this Comforter, this Holy   Spirit, you received, and it bore  witness unto you that you had in-  deed been initiated into the Church  of Christ. And if I were to call   upon this congregation of Latter-  day Saints today, and ask every   man and woman who thus heard   and obeyed, and who did receive  this testimony for themselves, to   rise to their feet, how many do you  think would remain seated? Not   many, if any. The fact that you  are thus gathered here, and that  you have these many years re-  mained faithful to the cause you   espoused, is evidence that you did   receive and are still in possession of   this testimony. And I would say,   if there are present today any   strangers who are not acquainted  with the principles of our religion,  let them gaze upon this congrega-  tion of over ten thousand faces;   let them travel through the   settlements of the Saints north  and south, and contemplate   the work that has been accomp-  lished in redeeming the earth and  making it habitable, and then let   them ask themselves the question,  are not these people in earnest? Are  they not sincere? Are they deceiv-  ers, these missionary Elders who   have been the means of inducing   the people of all lands to thus settle  and make homes in these valleys?   Do you believe in their works and   their mission? You say no. But let   me tell you, there is not an honest  man upon the face of the earth ac-  quainted with the history of the  Latter-day Saints that can say this  at heart. And I testify to you, as I  would to the whole world had I the  power to do so, that God has set His  hand to fulfil the word of the Lord   as given in the Bible, the book   of all books the Christian world pro-  fess to believe in; the revelations of   St. John, the predictions of Isaiah,  Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Joel, Micah, and   others contained within its sacred  lids, who spoke of the great work of  the last days; and I testify that the  day has come which Daniel saw,   the day referred to by him in his   interpretation of Nebuchudnezzar's   dream, when the God of heaven  should set up a kingdom which  should never be distroyed.    This Kingdom was represented to  him as a little stone cut out of the   mountain without hands, which  stone smote the image, representing   the different nations that then ex-  isted and should exist, on the feet,  breaking it to pieces; and it became   a great mountain, and filled the   whole earth. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] Was Daniel a pro-  phet? He was, and was highly   favored of God because of his   mighty faith. Isaiah saw our day  and time and was glad.    "Sing, O heavens; and be joyful,   O earth; and break forth into sing-  ing, O mountains: for the Lord hath  comforted his people, and will have  mercy upon his afflicted." What   is the matter? The Lord is going to  comfort Zion; He is going to have  mercy upon her afflicted ones. But  Zion said, "The Lord hath forsaken  me, and my Lord hath forgotten   me." "Can a woman forget her   sucking child?" saith the Lord.  "Yea, she may forget, but I will not   forget thee. Behold, I have graved  thee upon the palms of my hands;   thy walls are continually before  me." This refers to the building   up of Zion in the last days; the   gathering together of the people,   preparatory to the coming of the   Son of Man. [##Isaiah 49:13-16##]    As far as constitutional liberty is   concerned, I will say, the God of   heaven has raised up our nation, as  foretold by His Prophets genera-  tions ago. He inspired Colum-  bus, and moved upon him to  cross the ocean in search of this   continent. The world is acquainted   with the history of his course; his   pleadings with the courts of Europe,   and his final triumph in finding  sympathy in the King and Queen   of Spain, who furnished the neces-  sary means to make the exploration.   It is also well known how our fore-  fathers found a home and an asylum  in this land from the hand of perse-  cution, and how they planted here  the tree of liberty and jealously   guarded it from the attempt of the   mother country to uproot and de-  stroy it. The hand of God was in   all this; and it is through the inter-  vention of His providences that we   enjoy today the freest and most in-  dependent government the world   ever saw. And what was the object   of this? It was to prepare the way   for the building up of the Kingdom  of God in this the last dispensation  of the fullness of times; and as long   as the principles of constitutional   liberty shall be maintained upon  this land, blessings will attend  the nation. But wo unto those who  fight against Zion, said the Lord. I  have heard the Prophet Joseph   Smith remark, that if he were  Emperor of the world, and had the  power to control the whole human   family, he would sustain every man,  woman and child in the enjoy-  ment of their civil and religious   rights, let their religion be what it  may. In saying this he expressed  my sentiments, and the feelings of   this entire community. For God  has given to every man individual   agency, and He will hold him ac-  countable for the use of this agency.  And while we in our hearts and   feelings accord to the whole world  this blessing, we claim the same for   ourselves. To obtain this and to  secure it to our children, we have  struggled; and we look forward with  joyful anticipation when it shall be   beyond the power of man to drive it   any more from the earth. Our feel-  ings with regard to religious liberty   have been manifested towards   the religious denominations that   have come among us. Not  a single one of them can accuse us 
 THE  DESERET WEEKLY.  PIONEER PUBLICATION OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION.  ESTABLISHED JUNE 1850.  TRUTH AND LIBERTY.    NO. 15. SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, SATURDAY, APRIL 8, 1889. VOL. XXXVIII.    DISCOURSE  Delivered by President Wilford Wood-  ruff, at Springville, Tuesday Morn-  ing, March 5th, 1889.    REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.    Brethren and sisters: I feel to say,   God bless you. I am glad to meet   with you and to have the privilege   of once more bearing my testimony   to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and   the Kingdom of God. What Brother  Cannon has told you with regard to  the work of the Lord, is true.  I   have traveled in my day a great   many miles with the Prophet Joseph   Smith. I once heard him say that   if he were the emperor of the world   and had control of the whole human  family, he would defend every   man, woman and child in the en-  joyment of their religion, no matter   what their religion was, whether it  was true or false. He said they had   a right to that privilege, and the   exercise of that agency which  God had given to the whole human  family. Those were his sentiments.  They are my sentiments today.  The    Revelator, St. John, represented to   us that there would be about six  hundred three-score and six differ-  ent religions upon the earth in these   last days—the number of the name   that was spoken of by him. Today   that number, I presume, is very   nearly filled. The whole Christian   world are as diverse in their views  and principles of religion and roads   to heaven or hell, as the stars are  diverse in their position in the  heavens. And while I would grant  this privilege that I have spoken of,  to all mankind, I claim the same   privilege for myself and for all our   people. We have a right to the en-  joyment of our religion and belief,   and to practice the same on the   earth; and all other sects and parties  have the same right.    Inasmuch as I claim this, I want  to give some of my views and tell   you my feelings with regard to the   Gospel of Jesus Christ. To com-  mence with, I will quote the words  of the Apostle Paul. You are doubt-  less familiar with Paul's history,  and know what a persecutor of the  Saints he once was, and how he  became converted to the truth; and   his conversion was so thorough and   complete that he finally laid down  his life in defense of the Gospel of  Christ. That same Paul said:    "Though we, or an angel from   heaven, preach any other gospel un-  to you than that which we have   preached unto you, let him be   accursed."    That was a strong declaration;   and to make it more emphatic, he   repeated it.    Now, brethren and sisters, and   friends, that Gospel which Paul  taught is what I believe in. It is   what I have believed in since I was   old enough to read the New Testa-  ment. My belief in that Gospel was   so strong that I never joined any   sect or denomination on the earth  until I heard a man preach to me 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  delivered the following discourse:    My brethren and sisters and friends:  By way of introduction I desire to say  that I feel to thank God and all my  friends for the blessing I enjoy at this   time—for the privilege, once more, of  entering this Tabernacle and behold  ing the faces of the Latter-day Saints.  And I feel a good deal as   Mark Antony did when he went to bury  Caesar. "I come to bury Caesar," said  he, "not to praise him." I come to   see the Latter-day Saints, but   not to preach to them. You have  plenty of Apostles and Elders to  preach the word of the Lord unto you.  But I have long desired to again enter  this Tabernacle of the Lord and see   the Latter-day Saints. It has been  some three years, I think, since I have  met with the Saints of God in this  house; and I will tell you how I felt  about coming to Conference. I felt   that it would not be doing our great  and mighty nation any harm—a nation  of sixty millions of people—for two or  three old men, seventy-five or eighty  years of age, to come into this Taber-  nacle and look at the Latter-day   Saints, and at the faces of their wives  and children. I do not know that I   have a wife or child here. If I have,  they will be able to see how old I have  grown since we last met. Some of us  have tried to keep the law to such an  extent that we have almost forgotten   how our wives and children look. I   feel, however, to say, God bless the  Marshal and officers of the government  as far as they can exercise mercy,  charity and humanity toward   the Latter-day Saints in ful-  filling their duty as officers   of the government. I feel thankful   to-day for this privilege, and I feel at  peace with all mankind. I am at  peace with all my friends. As to my   enemies, I do not know that I have   any. If I have, I hope that we may be  at peace upon the principles of the  Gospel of Christ, of righteousness and   of truth.    Now, with regard to preaching to  you, my brethren and sisters, that is  a subject I have thought very little   about. I have preached this Gospel  for some fifty-four years, and have  learned by experience a great while  ago that it is no use for an   Elder in Israel to decide in his mind  what he is going to say to the Saints  of God. This is the way I feel to-day.   And I will say this, that there are  times in a man's life when he cannot   help reflecting upon the past. That is   my condition to-day. Since I have  entered this Tabernacle, and looked   upon this congregation, my mind has   reverted to my life from  the time I became a mem-  ber of the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter-day Saints, and this engen-  ders in my bosom some very solemn   reflections. Fifty-four years ago this  last spring I traveled a thousand miles  with the Prophet Joseph, and his   brother Hyrum, Brothers Brigham   Young, Heber C. Kimball, George A.  Smith, and a great many other men—  some 205 in all—mostly Elders in  Israel—for the redemption of our   brethren—to assist them in the midst  of persecution. Our Prophets and  Patriarchs, many of them, have passed   away. They are on the other side of   the vail. Since we came into these val-  leys forty years ago the twenty-fourth   of last July—I drove President Young  into this valley in my carriage, and he   was sick at the time—eleven of the   Apostles have passed away. They are  in the spirit world mingling with the   Gods, where they can plead for their  brethren. These are reflections that  rest upon my mind as I occupy this   stand where I have met day after day  and year after year with these noble   men. President John Taylor, who was   our last President and Apostle has also   taken his departure. The last time I   was in this house I met here  with him. His work is finished.   He has gone into the spirit world,   where we shall all go very soon. Some-  times, in my reflections, I feel some-  what lonesome when I think these   matters over. I feel as if I had lived   two or three generations since the  days of Kirtland and Nauvoo, or since  the establishment of this Church and  Kingdom with which I have been as-  sociated for so many years. I realize  myself that I shall not dwell a great   while upon the earth. I do not ex-  pect to dwell a great while longer   with the Latter-day Saints. I  have lived to the age of four score  years, and when I contemplate the  multitude that has passed away since  we entered these valleys of the moun-  tains, I can only expect to take my  turn with the rest. But I will say this.  I rejoice in the Gospel of Jesus Christ;   I rejoice in the work of God; I rejoice  in the principles of eternal life, light   and truth, which have been revealed to  the Latter-day Saints.    We have been called as a people to  pass through a great deal of affliction  in our day and time. But this eternal   truth remains on earth and in heaven—  that the God of Israel has set His hand  to establish His Church and Kingdom   upon the earth, and to fulfill the reve-  lations contained within the Holy   Bible, the Old and New Testament, as  well as other records which have been  given concerning the last dispensation  and fulness of times.    We are all of us, brethren and sis-  ters, dependent upon God our Heav-  enly Father for all our blessings, both   temporal and spiritual. Indeed, while  I contemplate our progress, our ad-  vancement, and the signs of the times  in which we live, I feel that we, as  Latter-day Saints, should try to fully  realize and comprehend our responsi-  bility before God, before each other,  before the heavens, and before the   earth.    I have for a long time had a desire to  mingle with the Latter-day Saints, and   to take part in their institutions—the  Sabbath schools, the Mutual Improve-  ment Associations, and with the var-  ious organizations of the Church.   But for several years I have been la-  boring in other portions of the coun-  try, and have been deprived of the  privilege of meeting with the Saints so  far as this portion of the Territory is   concerned.    I have desired from my youth up to  become acquainted with the truth as  contained in the Gospel of Jesus   Christ. From my youth up I have had  a desire to live and find the people of  God on the earth. I have lived to see   that day. I have lived to see Proph-  ets, Apostles and inspired men. I have   associated with them for many years  of my life. This has been a great  pleasure to me, and a great satisfac-  tion to my own spirit.    And I desire to say to the Latter-  day Saints, that we should remember   that we are sent here on a mission;   that we have been born in the flesh in  this last dispensation of the fulness  of times. We have been called to  labor in the vineyard of the Lord,  called to preach the Gospel, called to   warn the nations of the earth, and  many of them have been warned. We  have traveled by land and by sea; have  visited many foreign nations, also al-  most every part of our own nation,  and some of us are drawing our mis-  sions to a close.    I have a desire that the Latter-day   Saints should try to live their religion,  and endeavor to do what is right; that  they should have faith in God, and in  the revelations of God, and in the  principles which have been revealed to   the Saints for the salvation of the hu-  man family.    We have a great many organizations  in the Church and Kingdom of God,  and have had almost from the be-  ginning. They are so organized   that all men and women, whether   young or old, have a place of useful-  ness. We should try to improve our  time, our talents and our opportunities   while we are here upon the earth. I   realize that this world is not our abid-  ing place. We have an evidence of   this every day of our lives. We are  called to bury our Prophets, Apostles,  Elders, fathers, mothers, wives and  children, all of which shows us that  we have no lease of life. We should   therefore improve our time to-day.    I have felt to give the Latter-day  Saints my faith and prayers in all their   labors and exertions to build up the   kingdom of God. I try to build it up  to the best of my ability in accordance  with the light and truth and knowledge  which God has given me.    This is the first time that I have en-  deavored to speak in public for a good  while. I have not been laboring in the  midst of congregations like this. I   have just passed through a week of   sickness, which laid me prostrate. I  feel the effects of it in my lungs, and in  my system, yet I feel all right in my   spirit. I felt as though I desired to  look upon the faces of the Latter-day  Saints, and hear the testimonies of   my brethren. They have heard  my testimony in years past.  I have the same testimony  to bear to-day. I bear record before  God, angels and men, that the fulness  of the everlasting Gospel has been re-  vealed in these last days through the   Prophets of God; and that Joseph  Smith was raised up by the power of   God as a Prophet, Seer and Revelator.   He laid the foundation of this Church   and Kingdom in its perfection, as it is   at the present time. He brought forth  the record as contained in the Book of   Mormon, in fulfillment of the predic-  tions of the Prophets of God;   also the Book of Doctrine   and Covenants, which contains  those grand and solemn revelations,  and those principles of eternal truth,   so precious to the Latter-day Saints.  These things are true. We should   study them; lay them up in our hearts,   and practice them in our lives. This   is the kingdom of God and the Church  of Jesus Christ. The Lord Almighty   has set His hand to carry out the great   programme of the last dispensation  and fulness of times. If this had not  been true, Utah to-day would have  been in all probability a desert as we  found it in 1847, when first we came  here. God has been watching over this  people, and will continue to watch so long as  we continue to do our duty. So long a[s]   we humble ourselves before the Lord,   so long as we keep His command-  ments, so long will the hand of God be  over the Latter-day Saints; Zion will  arise; Zion will be clothed upon by  the power of God. The Lord is watch-  ing over her; the heavens have been   watching over this people, and have  been from the beginning. We have the  blessings of God with us. They are   manifest in our temporal and spiritual  affairs.    As I said in the beginning of my re-  marks, I realize that the voices of   those we were accustomed to hear in  the past are hushed in death. We   shall hear them no more. The rest of   us will follow in their train. We   shall all pass away in our time, and we  have a long eternity before us in the  world to come. Those that have   passed away have closed their work   here and are laboring to-day on the  other side of the vail.    You have had laid before you, dur-  ing this Conference, some things per-  taining to the redemption of our dead  and some things in regard to the [build-]  ing of temples. These, brethren and  sisters, are important works. They  are works which we do for others that   they cannot do for themselves. This   is what Jesus Christ did when He laid  down His life for our redemption, be-  cause we could not redeem ourselves.  We have fathers and mothers and  kindred in the spirit world, and [we]  have a work to perform in their [behalf].  As an individual I have had great [in-]  terest in this work of redeeming the  dead, and so have my brethren and  sisters. This is a labor we must [con-]  tinue as far as we have opportunity.   This principle was taught by [the]  Apostle Paul. He asks, "If the [dead]  rise not at all, why are they then [bap-]  tized for the dead?" This is a [work]   that rests upon the Latter-day Saints.  Do what you can in this [life,]  so that when you pass to the   other side of the vail [your]   fathers, mothers, relatives and friends   will bless you for what you have done,  and inasmuch as you have been in-  struments in the hands of God in [pro-]  curing their redemption you will be  recognized as Saviors upon Mount   Zion in fulfilment of prophecy.    I hope that our institutions—[those]  that have been referred to in our   Epistle—the Relief Societies, Sunday  Schools, Mutual Improvement Asso-  ciations, etc., will continue to do good.   They have done a great [deal of]  good, and still have the power to do  more. These institutions [belong]   to the organizations of the [Church]   of Jesus Christ of Latter-day [Saints.]   The brethren and sisters should [con-]  tinue to labor in them in behalf [of the]  rising generation of this people. [The]  Mutual Improvement Assoc[iations]  are good schools in which to [prepare]  our young men for the [vineyard of]   Christ. So also are the various [quo-]  rums of the Priesthood, and we [should]   all labor to the best of our ab[ility to]   fulfill the duties devolving upon us.    I feel the effect of my sickness[; I feel]  it upon my lungs, and do not think [it]   necessary to continue my rema[rks.

 562 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    of doing anything to hinder them   in their labors by way of establish-  ing themselves among us; on the   other hand, we have opened our   doors to them; they have occupied   our public stands until they have   had meeting houses of their own.   We have never had a fear that our   people or our children would be  captivated by their doctrine or con-  verted to their religion; if they  have a single truth which we have not,  we want it, for it is truth we are   after. This Church has been or-  ganized now nearly sixty years. It   certainly has been like the little  stone cut out of the mountain with-  out hands. [##Daniel 2:44-45##] It has withstood all the  opposition that has been aimed  against it; and it will remain firm   and immovable, fulfilling the desti-  ny marked out for it, until the   winding up scene. Zion will arise,   clothed with the glory of God, no  matter what we may have to pass   through. We are in the hands of   God, and so are all men and na-  tions; and if this is the work of God  —and we say it is—He will bear it   off triumphant.  Brother George Q. Cannon in his  discourse this morning referred to  the different laws which govern  man, and the different glories that   attend their observance. And I  would say, show me a nation or   people and I will tell you their fu-  ture condition by the laws which  govern them. All the creations of   God are governed by law; and all  blessings are predicated upon the   observance of law. Opposition to   the laws of God commenced in the  councils of heaven at the time one-  third of the heavenly hosts were  cast out; and they are here upon the  earth still opposing the work of God.  They are without tabernacles; they  never had bodies, and that is the  curse visited upon them. Those  who did not rebel were permitted to   take tabernacles. The war that  commenced at that time is still be-  ing waged, and the struggle will con-  tinue until Christ shall come to as-  sume the reigns of government.  There have been very few   people in any age of the   world ready to receive the Gospel  when presented to them. In the  days of Noah only eight souls be-  lieved on him, although he and his   sons preached to the anti-deluvian  world a hundred and twenty years. [##Genesis 6:3##] [##Moses 8:18-27##]  In consequence of their having be-  come ripened in iniquity, the Lord   determined to destroy them from the   face of the earth. Enoch appeared  in his day as the representative of  God, and succeeded in raising up a  Church who so far perfected them-  selves in the ways of the Lord as  to be worthy of translation. They,   we are told, will return to the earth   with Christ and the Church of the  First Born, when His Saints upon  the earth shall be prepared to meet  Him. [##Moses 7##] In the days of Jesus and the  Apostles, comparatively few be-  lieved on them, and the opposition   was so strong against them that   they were all, excepting one, put to   death. That was a day of sacrifice;  the time had not then arrived for  the Lord to establish His Kingdom.  The consequence was that the  Church fled to the wilderness, and  the Priesthood was taken home to  the Paradise of God, where it re-  mained until the restoration  through the Prophet Joseph Smith.    We have at present about two  hundred thousand people in these   mountains who have received the   Gospel, out of the millions that now   inhabit the earth, and it seems, in  consequence of the unpopularity of   the Gospel, that we are under the   necessity of passing through more  or less persecution. We have these   things to meet, as other men have   met them. In ancient times the  Apostles were ready to lay down  their lives for the truth's sake.   They knew that Jesus Christ was  the Son of God, and that they had  been called to and endowed with  the Priesthood of heaven. Are we  any better than they? Are the   Apostles of this day any better than  those of former days? If God were  to require it at our hands that   our testimony be sealed by  our blood, I believe there is  not a single member of the   Council of the Twelve but what  would be ready to make the sacri-  fice. Why? Because we, like the   former day Apostles, know for our-  selves that Jesus is the Christ, the  Son of the living God, and that we  are His servants. Whatever sacri-  fices the Lord may require at the  hands of this people, will be met by  the people. But ours is not a day   of sacrifice. Our special calling is   to build up Zion, and prepare the  people to stand in holy places while  the judgments of the Lord are being   poured out upon the wicked. And   whatever may be before us we must   meet in the fear of our God, believ-  ing that He will deliver us in His  own due time. The Lord, for our   encouragement, has told us that   Zion shall not be moved out of her   place. But if we do not do our part,   as the brethren have said who have  preached to us this Confer-  ence, we shall be chastised. This is   my testimony to the Latter-day  Saints.    In reflecting upon these things I  have a great deal of sympathy for   those who array themselves against   us, as I have for the Jews who op-  posed the Savior and His Apostles.   When upon the cross suffering the  agonies of a cruel death, Christ ex-  claimed, "Father, forgive them, for  they know not what they do." [##Luke 23:34##] Why  did the Savior feel thus towards   those who opposed him? Because   He had clearly before his mind the  results of their acts; that they were  only heaping coals of fire upon their  own heads; that all He had predicted   concerning them would sooner or  later overtake them; which certain-  ly has been the case.  The Lord is again calling upon  the human family to repent of their  sins. And while in the pursuit of   their calling some of our brethren  have been called upon to lay down  their lives for the work of God.   What will be the result of the rejec-  tion of the Gospel by this genera-  tion? The answer has been written  by St. John, by Isaiah and has been  reiterated by the revelations of God  through the Prophet Joseph. Woe  unto them, says the Lord, that fight  against Zion; woe unto all nations  that continue in their iniquities;   they have reason to weep for them-  selves and their posterity.    To the Latter-day Saints I would  say, be ye faithful in keeping the   commandments of God the little   time we have to remain here. We  are as much upon a mission to this  generation, as the Prophets which  have preceded us were to the gener-  ations in which they lived. We   have our day; they had theirs. As  they have gone to render an ac-  count of their stewardship, so we   shall follow, and will be held to an-  swer for the deeds done in the body,   and the manner in which we shall   have used the talents entrusted to   us. Brethren and sisters, be true  and faithful, and keep inviolate the   covenants you have entered into,   that we may be worthy of eternal  life, the greatest of all the gifts of   God to man.  I rejoice in meeting with so many  of the Latter-day Saints in Confer-  ence; and I have rejoiced in listen-  ing to the testimonies of the Elders.  I have often said in my boyhood, I  wished I could see an Apostle   or some one that was able to teach   me the same Gospel I had read of in   the New Testament. But I could  never find no man that could teach   those doctrines; it was said they have   been done away. They were done   away, it is true, but through the un-  belief of the children of men. But  they are with us. The Kingdom of   God is here, and the Lord will sus-  tain it. And I can bear record as  my brethren have, that this king-  dom will stand; and that the Zion   of God will remain upon the earth  until Jesus shall come to receive us  unto himself. And my prayer is   that you and I, and all this people,   may be true and faithful, working  with an eye single to the glory of   God, for the building up of Zion,  and the establishing of His king-  dom upon the earth; and when we  go to the other side of the veil, we   can there assemble with all those  who have kept the celestial law,   and honored the Holy Priesthood,   from Father Adam down to our  day, and with them receive our in-  heritance, and have part in the  morning of the first resurrection,  with our wives and children, fathers   and mothers, brothers and sisters,  each in the family organization in   the Celestial World. Amen.

 444 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    to ninety years and upward have passed through one of the most interest-  ing generations of the children of men. What marvelous changes have  occurred in our lifetime! We see things to-day and look upon them with-  out wonder that in our early days would have been considered miraculous.  When I was a small boy we had just emerged from under the blue laws of   Connecticut—to greater freedom of thought and action. The ducking-  stool and other forms of punishment akin to it had been laid aside.  Women were no longer hanged or burned at the stake as witches. Greater   religious liberty was enjoyed. Women were allowed to kiss their children,   husbands their wives, on the Sabbath day, without being punished for it.  If a boy took an ear of corn from the field, although even then he might   be punished for it, he was not in danger of being sold as a slave, as in   former days. The improved condition of things had just been brought   about when I came into the world. But greater and more wonderful  changes have been accomplished since that time. In my boyhood every   acre of grain was cut with a sickle in New England. The first advance   made in that direction was when the hand cradle came into use. The  reaper and the binder were never dreamed of in those days. If such   things had been brought into the wheatfields then, the people of the land   would have almost thought the millennium had come. And there has been   rapid advancement in almost every department of life.    "I need not take up your time in detailing the many changes and   improvements that have been made. We live to-day amid the won-  derous powers of steam and electricity, by which such marvelous things  are being accomplished. All these things have been brought about in our   day, and I feel to thank God for what He has done for the children of men   in blessing them as He has done. Mankind have great cause for thankful-  ness to our Father in heaven because of the many blessings He has be-  stowed upon them in this day and generation.    "We who live in Utah have especial cause to thank and praise His holy   name for the blessings we enjoy. I have spent fifty years in these valleys  of the Rocky Mountains, and have passed through all the phases of a   territorial government until we have arrived at full statehood, and I feel   it a great privilege to meet with so many of my friends and citizens of the   State of Utah, and I consider it proper here to make some reference to  our arrival as pioneers, and the commencement of our labors in this great  American desert. And I should be recreant in my duty and justly place   myself under strong reproof did I not give the honor and glory to our   great prophet, seer, revelator and pioneer, President Brigham Young, who,   under God, laid the foundation of redeeming this great, barren American  desert from its sterility into the fruitful and noble State of Utah as we  find it to-day. President Young was inspired to come here, and he was  inspired to work after he got here, and when Samuel Brannan, who took   the ship Brooklyn from New York to San Francisco, loaded with Latter-  day Saints, came to this barren country and ment with the pioneers, he   looked upon the desolation and barrenness, and tried with all the power   he had to persuade President Young not to stop here, but to go on to   California. I heard President Young give his answer to Samuel Brannan

 450 THE DESERET WEEKLY    that Gospel. He held the Priest-  hood, and he taught me the same   Gospel that Paul taught. As many   of you may have heard me remark  before, I went to Sabbath school, in  my boyhood, under Dr. Porter, in   Farmington, Connecticut. He and   Dr. Haws, of Hartford, Conn.,   were Presbyterian divines, and were   considered great men in that day.   In that Sabbath school I read the   New Testament. I learned verse   after verse and chapter after chap-  ter. What did the Testament teach   me? It taught me the Gos-  pel of life and salvation; it   taught me a Gospel of pow-  er before the heavens and on  the earth. It taught me that the   organization of the Church consist-  ed of Prophets, Apostles, Pastors  and Teachers, with helps and gov-  ernments. What for? "For the per-  fecting of the Saints, for the work   of the ministry: for the edifying   of the body of Christ, till we all   come in the unity of the faith and   of the knowledge of the Son of God,  unto a perfect man, unto the meas-  ure of the stature of the fulness   of Christ." These are the   things which I learned, and they  made an impression upon me.   I believed in them; yet I had never  heard them taught by any clergy-  man or divine upon the earth. In   my early manhood I attended the   meetings of almost every denomina-  tion there was. On one occasion I   attended one of those great meet-  ings which were sometimes held in  Connecticut, at which forty or fifty   ministers of various denominations   were gathered together. They   prayed for a pentecostal season and   for a good many other things. At  this meeting permission was given   for anybody to make remarks. I   was quite young then. I arose and   stepped into the aisle, and I said to   that body of ministers: "My   friends, will you tell me why you   don't contend for the faith once de-  livered to the Saints? Will you tell  my why you don't contend for that  Gospel that Jesus Christ taught, and   that His Apostles taught? Why do   you not contend for that religion that  gives unto you power before God,   power to heal the sick, to make the   blind to see, the lame to walk, and   that gives you the Holy Ghost and   those gifts and graces that have been   manifest from the creation of the   world? Why do you not teach the   people those principles that the  ancient Patriarchs and Prophets   taught while they were clothed with   the revelations of God? They had  the administrations of angels; they    had dreams and visions, and con-  stant revelation to guide and direct  them in the path in which they  should walk." The presiding elder  said: "My dear young man, you  would be a very smart man, and a  very useful man in the earth, if you  did not believe all those foolish   things. These things were given   to the children of men in the dark   ages of the world, and they were   given for the very purpose of en-  lightening the children of men in   that age, that they might believe in   Jesus Christ. Today we live in the  blaze of the glorious gospel light,   and we do not need these things."  Said I: "Then give me the dark   ages of the world; give me those  ages when men received these prin-  ciples."    There is where I stood in my   youth. I did not believe that these   gifts and graces were done away,  only through the unbelief of the   children of men. They were done   away when men rejected the law of   the Gospel of Jesus Christ; turned   away from the Kingdom of God,   built up altars to Baal, and sought  to carry out principles of their own.   And the earth remained in that con-  dition until the Lord raised up a   Prophet in these last days. He  raised up Joseph Smith, who laid   the foundation of this Church and   Kingdom. And from that day un-  til the present, whenever any one   has embraced the Gospel of Christ  and lived that religion, the gifts and   blessings of that Gospel have been   bestowed upon them. And this   will be so unto the end.    I have traveled many thousands   of miles, at home and abroad,  preaching the Gospel of Christ to   my fellow-men; and, in my experi-  ence, I have never known a man or   woman who, when they received   the Gospel with honest hearts and   were baptized, did not receive a tes-  timony for themselves.  While in   England, in 1840, I was inspired of  the Lord to go to Herefordshire.   There had never been any Elders in   that part of the country. When I   arrived there I found about six hun-  dred people called United Brethren.   They had broken off from the Wes-  leyan Methodists. They sought for   those ancient gifts that I have been   speaking about. They had been  praying to God to open the way be-  fore them. What was the conse-  quence? All of them, except one,   including forty-five preachers, were   baptized in thirty days. They re-  ceived the Gospel, and the gifts and   graces followed them.    As I said before, these are the    principles that I believe in. And I  will say here that this same Gospel  was with Father Adam, with Noah,   with Enoch, and with all the an-  cient patriarchs and prophets.   There has been no change. And I   say, as a servant of God, there is no  change in the eternal and everlast-  ing Priesthood. It is without be-  ginning of days or end of years. It  is from eternity unto eternity. By   the power of that Priesthood, God,   our Eternal Father, has organized   all worlds, and redeemed all worlds   that have ever been redeemed. By   that same Priesthood men have ad-  ministered on the earth in the or-  dinances of the Gospel of Christ.   There is no change to the Gospel of   Jesus Christ, nor to one of the or-  dinances thereof. And whenever   that Gospel is offered to the children   of men, it is by the power of the  Priesthood. No man who has ever  breathed the breath of life, since   God made the world, has ever had   the power to go forth and minister  in one of the ordinances of the Gos-  pel of Christ, without that Priest-  hood; and no man ever will. This   may not be believed by many of the   inhabitants of the earth; but it is true.    We have been gathered to these   valleys of the mountains by the  power and inspiration of God. We   might have gone forth and preached   till we had become as old as Methu-  selah, and if the power of the Al-  mighty had not attended that   preaching, Utah might still have   been a desert. But the Spirit of God  bore record to the teachings of the   Elders of Israel, and the honest in  heart and meek of the earth re-  ceived the Gospel and gathered to   these valleys.  This is in fulfill-  ment of the revelations of God.   John the Revelator, in his vision on   the Isle of Patmos, saw "another an-  gel fly in the midst of heaven, hav-  ing the everlasting Gospel to preach   unto them that dwell on the earth,   and to every nation, and kindred,   and tongue, and people, saying with   a loud voice, Fear God and give   glory to Him; for the hour of His   judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##] Those words   have been fulfilled. The angel of  God has visited the earth and deliv-  ered the fulness of the Gospel unto  the inhabitants thereof, and they are   receiving it. By the power of that   Gospel you left your homes and came  to these mountains of Israel.    Now, Paul says that if we preach   any other gospel than that which he   taught, we should be accursed. [##Galatians 1:8##] The   first principle in that Gospel is faith   in Christ as the Savior of the world.

W. WOODRUFF    LATE FROM AMERICA  Manchester, July 13, 1840.     TO THE EDITOR OF THE STAR.  Dear Brother,  Having just received a letter   from Mrs. Woodruff, I make a few  extracts, to be inserted in the Star, if   you think proper. --W. WOODRUFF.    Montrose, Iowa Territory, North America,  May 4, 1840.    My dear Companion,    The Conference held in Com-  merce on the 6th of April, was at-  tended with much interest. More   than 70 were baptised, many elders   ordained, and much business trans-  acted. Elder O. Hyde and John E.  Page, started on their mission, soon  after the Conference, to visit the Jews.   They go first to the Jews in New   York, and then on to Palestine.   They will call upon you in England,  as it will be on the way.    The work is rolling on in this  country with a greater rapidity than   ever before since the foundation of   the Church. There was an Indian,   his wife, and daughter, baptised in   Commerce a few days since; they  came some hundreds of miles to be-  come acquainted with the work; they  believed and embraced it joyfully.   They said every word of the Book of   Mormon was true. He was an in-  terpreter to six tribes, and he said   every one of his brethren would re-  ceive it; he knew it would be so.  Two Elders, with their families, have   gone out among the Indians on a   mission. Doctor Galland has just  returned from his mission, (I think   he started just before you left Mont-  rose,) and has brought 60 families  with him,and expects, it is said, 200   families more soon.    Commerce is building up surpri-  singly; the emigration there is said to  be much greater than it ever was in   Caldwell County.    I trust that you obtain the "Times   and Seasons," as the Editors said   they were forwarding them to each of   the Travelling Council. From those   papers you will learn of our Brethren's   success in this country, and many   things more correctly than I can in-  form you by writing. There has   been must destruction of shipping in   this country during the past season.   Since the destruction of Natchez by  a whirlwind, news has reached us that  New Orleans was covered with ten  feet of water, and that it was still   rising. It is said that the Indians   have been into two counties in Mis-  souri, and demanded and obtained  money, as a kind of tax for the land;   and that there are many fears enter-  tained by the Missourians concerning   the Indians.    The Rev. Mr. Bogart, the Metho-  dist preacher, who was the leader of   the Missouri mob in the late perse-

Some say I & Geo Smith cut him of [illegible] duties &c  They have a letter Eld Crandle Dunn  wrote to Elder Appleby, dated Aug. 4, [18]44  Eld Dunn, in this Letter claims  he was Presiding at this time in  Michigan & he & Harvey Green  tried & cut Mr Strang off &c  they have the Record of this, &  wonder how you could be  presiding, & try Strang for  adultery & nothing known  of it by them. They claim, one  of you mistake. If you cut him ^off^  some time in June, then he  could not been in the church,  in ^or^ on the 5th of Aug when Eld   Dunn, & Green cut him off for   heresy. In the trial of Aug   nothing is said of your June trials
