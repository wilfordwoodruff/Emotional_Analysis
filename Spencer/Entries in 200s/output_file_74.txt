 66 THE DESERET NEWS.DISCOURSEBy Elder Wilford Woodruff, delivered in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sun-day morning, Feb. 10, 1867.It seems to have fallen to my lot thismorning to occupy a little time with the brethren and sisters.  I desire that I may have the attention of the people,also a good degree of the Spirit of the Lord, for I have lived long enough, and have had experience enough in this Church to know that I cannot edify any-body by talking to them unless I do enjoy the Holy Spirit.  In the first place, I do not know what to say to the people only as that spirit may direct me; and I am dependent upon it, not only in this duty, but in all the duties of life, both temporal and spiritual.I rejoice in the goodness and mercy of God, and in the principles of the gospel of life and salvation that He has revealed in our day and generation for our exal-tation and His glory.  I feel that of all people under the heavens we have the greatest reason to rejoice, be thankful, faithful, prayerful and humble before the Lord our God.  The Lord has seenfit to organize the kingdom and put it into our hands to build up.  He has committed to us the plan of salvation, and has given us the holy priesthood, revelation and an organization--even the Government of God, whereby we can go to work here on the earth and mag-nify our callings, fulfil the object of our creation and receive ordinances and blessings which will give us exaltation and glory in the presence of God and the Lamb.  This is as much as He has ever done for any people that ever dwelt upon the fact of the earth; it is as much as any of our fathers ever possessed.  And while I look around me, and re-flect upon the present state of the na-tions of the earth, I feel as though it be-comes us as a people to arm ourselves with the power of God and every gift, advantage, privilege and blessing with-in our reach, that we may be preparedfor the great day of Almighty God, and the great events that await us and this generation; for more interesting events never did take place in any period of the world's history than will transpire in this--the last dispensation of the fulness of times.  It is true that the speed with which the Lord will propelor hasten the events of the last days will depend to some extent upon our union, obedience, good works and faithfulness in keeping His commandments; but on the other hand the actual fulfilment of God's purposes with regard to this gen-eration does not depend upon us, butour blessings, and the blessings of all men, depend on their course of con-duct.The Lord has shed His blood for the redemption of all men out of every na-tion under heaven; but He will deal with all according to the deeds done in the body, and He has commenced a con-troversy with the present generation in all nations which will never cease until the consumption decreed on the face ofthe earth is perfected and has its fulfil-ment.  The fact that the Lord will re-ward all men, nations, people and gen-erations according to the deeds done in the body was manifest in the days of Israel; for after leading Israel forty years in the wilderness, when they wereabout entering the promised land, Moseswent and plead with the Lord to give him the privilege to go over into Canaan.  But the Lord told Moses he could not go, and he gave His reasons why; in fact, He would not permit anybody to go, who came out of Egypt, over twentyyears of age, except Caleb and Joshua.  They had kept the commandments of God, fulfilled His will and manifested their faith in Him all the time, hence those two men were permitted to go over with the generation born in the wilderness, or at least with that portionof them not over twenty years of age. [##Numbers 13##]The Lord said, I am going to give this people the land of Canaan that I pro-mised their fathers, and I am going todestroy those nations now inhabiting it; but I want you, Israel, to understand that  I am not going to do so because of your righteousness, for you have been rebellious forty years in the wilderness,and I have been angry with, and should have cut you off many times had it not been for the pleading of Moses; but I am going to cut off these nations be-cause their cup of iniquity is full, be-cause they have sinned unto death and are ripe for the damnation of hell; and I will give the land of Canaan to the children of Israel, the seed of Abraham, not that they are very good themselves, but I have labored with them, they have my ordinances and blessings, and they are the best people I have.  -[See ##Deuteronomy 9|Deuteronomy chap. 9.##]-I have faith in God and in the revela-tions of Jesus Christ given in these last days, and in the stick of Joseph and in thestick of Judah, which are the Bible and the Book of Mormon, and as I look for-ward to their fulfilment on the earth, I will say that it pains my heart and feel-ings when I reflect on the history of the present generation. [##Ezekiel 37:16##] I do not believe that God ever saw a more wicked gen-eration than the one in which we live;I do not believe that any of those citiesor nations, namely, Sodom and Gomor-rah, the Canaanites, Hivites, Hittites, or Perisites ever were as guilty, or com-mitted more crime than the Christian world to-day.  They are given over to all manner of wickedness; the whole earth groans in pain under the abomi-nations that reign on the face thereof.  Look at our own good Christian coun-try -- the United States, at Europe, and all the world.  Where can any man be-hold the semblance of righteousness or righteous works?  What is the seed that is sown?  What is the conduct of men?  All the editors of papers in all countries, and the priests in every pulpit, wicked as they are themselves, are crying out against it; and they are ashamed of theabominations that continually rise be-fore them day and night.  Whenever a people, nation, generation or govern-ment forsakes virtue and departs from righteousness, becomes corrupt and pro-motes evil, and this principle is mani-fest from centre to circumference, it brings on its own head dissolution, de-struction and ruin, because the Lord will deal with all according to their deeds.There is no man who traveled in the United States, England, and among the nations abroad thirty or thirty-four years ago, and who has traveled in thosenations of late years, but who is aston-ished at the change which is manifest.  Right here in our own government, in every department thereof, from head tofoot, and not only there, but it is so in almost all situations under heaven; the majority of men neither acknowledge God nor regard man, but every man isfor gratifying his own passions and car-rying out his own desires; even should it involve the sacrifice of the rights of millions of the human family, it mat-ters not.The inhabitants of the earth, general-ly, acknowledge not the hand of God in anything, and they are making a con-tinued effort to uproot the only people who do acknowledge His hand and who are trying to build up his Kingdom.  While I look over the earth and see the people thus destitute of the Spirit of God, committing the works of darkness, enduring the buffetings of satan, and with the judgments of God right at their doors, I feel, brethren and sisters, that we, as Latter-day Saints should watch unto prayer and live continually before the Lord in such a manner that we may understand the signs of the times; every one of us should labor as though it were the last day of our lives,that we may obtain and enjoy what-ever privileges and blessings the Lordhas placed within our reach.  We should be united together that our righteous-ness, prayers and good works may come up before the Lord.  I believe in good works.  If a man does not that which isgood he does that which is evil; if he keeps not the commandments of God he breaks them, and will be punished with the loss of salvation and exaltation in the presence of God.  But if a man will be baptised for the re-mission of his sins and have hands laid on him for the Holy Ghost, and will keep God's commandments, receive his endowments, his patriarchal blessing and the holy priesthood, and continues faithful before the Lord, he magnifies his calling.  That is what the Lord sent him for, and that is what we are allsent for; to keep our estate by observing the law of God and acting up  to the light that God has revealed to us.I am aware and satisfied that no man can be saved only as he keeps the com-mandments of God.  It is true the blood of Jesus cleanses from all sin; the Lord has shed His blood, and laid down Hislife for the redemption of the human family; but notwithstanding this we never shall obtain salvation and exalt-ation in the presence of God unless we obey the gospel and those laws and commandments that the Lord reveals.  I rejoice that there are a few people, and that I have the privilege of being associated with them, who have em-braced the gospel of Christ.  We need not marvel nor feel surprised at the feelings of the nations around us, or that the present generation should opposeus, and go to a very great length intheir operations, even in a governmental capacity, to try and overthrow the churchand kingdom of God.  They do not like this kingdom; they do not understand what right the Lord has to establish akingdom in the last days; they do not believe that the earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof; they do not believe that the cattle on a thousand hills are His.  They do not believe that heaven is His Throne, and that the earth is His footstool; and although he has left his record and testimony which have been before the Christian world for genera-tions, that he will raise a righteous peo-ple, and will establish a kingdom and will come and reign on the earth, yet they do not believe these things.  But we who have looked forward to this for years past are right in the midst of this work, and to build up this kingdom is certainly a most interesting labor, and one in which I rejoice, and I want to live in that way and manner that I mayhave the Spirit of the Lord to guide, direct and assist me in whatever duties I may have to perform.I have no fears with regard to whatthis generation may do, or attempt to do, for I know that if we will do our duty we shall be saved.  One thing is certain, if the Lord deals with all men according to the deeds done in the body, the seed now being sown in the world will bring death, misery, destruction andsorrow upon the heads of the nations of the earth.  The Lord is going to visit this generation, and His judgments will be severe, and they who undertake to overthrow the church and kingdom ofGod, fight against Him and His work; will find they will not make headway,for the Lord has decreed that He would establish His work in the last days, and His word will certainly be fulfilled.  I will say that destruction awaits thisgeneration, the heavens are full of judg-ments, and the angels of God with theslaughtering weapons in their hands, are waiting in His presence in the Temple in heaven, as the prophet saw by vision, to go and reap down the earth. The prophetEzekiel had a view of this on one oc-casion when the Lord told him thatthose men with the destroying weaponswere commanded to go and reap downthe earth; one of their number had a writer's inkhorn, and he was command-ed to set a mark on those who sighed and cried over the abominations com-mitted on the earth.  And the angel went forth and set a mark on those whokept the commandments of God; the rest followed, and slew every man ex-cept those who were thus marked.  They began at the sanctuary, and it was in the last days; [##Ezekiel 9##] and judgments surely await this generation because their wicked acts bring judgment on them-selves, but with the Latter-day Saints everything depends on their faithfulness before the Lord.I have a desire to see this people faith-ful.  The Lord has stayed His hand injudgment until this gospel could be preached to all nations, before the end came; and years ago, He told the Latter-day Saints to go forth, in faith and without fear, and bear testimony of thethings of the kingdom of God.  "And," said He, "they who reject you and your testimony of me, I will curse and des-troy; for my judgments shall follow; with thunder, lightnings, tempests, storms, fire, sword and plague will I plead with all flesh and the slain of the Lord  shall be many." [##Luke 10:16##]  The Lord has commenced His work and His promised judgments are in process of fulfilment.We could not build up this kingdom, make it spread, and build up Zion if the Lord did not work for us; the powers of darkness and evil that are so universal would uproot and destroy the kingdom of God from the face of the earth if the Lord Almighty did not defend it and cut of[f] the bitter branches; it would bein the same position as the city of Enoch,and as Christ and his Apostles, and as the prophets in many dispensations were; there would be no room for it but it and every righteous principle would be overpowered by the powers of darkness and death.  We, however, have the promise of the Lord that He has set His hand for the last time to es-tablish His kingdom, and that He will fight for Mount Zion, and will utterly cut off those who fight against it.  Then we need not trouble ourselves about what our enemies may do, whether theyare here in Utah, at Washington or in any other part of the world.  We need not trouble ourselves about this, our

But as it wouldbe right for Bro. Joseph to standat the head of the wholechurch instead of only part, itwould be possible (while that canbe gradually brought about) forus by a united effort to establishthe poor in Zion and thus reacha complete unity in the near future.It shall be my constant effort

 to impress upon the different factionthe fact that they must recognizethe authority of the rest in asmuchas they have been baptized by one hav-ing authority. For every one whohas been baptized by one having authority belong to the churchof God notwithstanding the factthat ^some^ may have gone astrayin some things. For it cannotbe possible for the authority to betaken from a church until theysin against the Holy Ghost.To my mind the quotation from the D and C which our peoplequote to show that the churchnow there lost their authority,namely  "the church shall berejected with her baptisms for the dedad" only shows a suspensionof the work of establishing Zionand the baptisms for the dead. 
 DISCOURSEBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,In the 15th Ward Meeting Houseon Sunday Evening, June13th, 1880.______REPORTED BY GEO. F. GIBBS.---------I HAVE spent but very little time inSalt Lake City on the Sabbath daysince my return from the south; Sat-urdays and Sundays I have generally spent the time attending our Quar-terly Conferences abroad. I havefelt as though I would like to visit the people in a ward capacity as far as I have opportunity, and I thought I would call down and visit our friends of the 15th Ward this eve-ning.I have been very much edified in listening to Bro. Morgan, and I con-sider he has a correct idea of the state of our country, and also with regard to the events that await us,as a people, and also this generation.Part of Bro. Morgan's remarks re-mind me of my first mission, espe-cially that part describing the man-ner in which the missionaries in the Southern States travel. The groundthat Bro. Morgan has been traveling over, I traversed through the winter of 1834-5 and the year following;and I could not help contrasting, inmy own mind, while listening to him, the manner in which he and his brethren travel, with the man-ner in which I and others traveledin the early days. You who have read the Doctrine and Covenantsunderstand that some of the revela-tions therein contained were givenunto us at that time. The first mis-sionary labor I performed in this Church was done by commandment,without purse or scrip. My first mission after I went up to Zion's Camp was through the SouthernStates. I called upon Bishop Par-tridge, who was our first Bishop, who was then in Missouri, ClayCounty. He said he wished someof the elders to go into the SouthernCountry. I asked him a few ques-tions, some of which were these:"Where do you want me to go?" Hesaid, "I would like you to go through Missouri into Arkansas." Said I,"Jackson County lies directly in our road, is it your advice that we go through Jackson County?" He re-plied that he had not faith enough himself to travel through Jackson County; but that if we had we might do so. You, perhaps, will re-member that we had just been driv-en out from there, and it was as much as a Mormon's life was worth to be seen in Jackson County. I said to him: "Bishop Partridge, shallwe go without purse or scrip?" Hesaid, "I have not got faith enough to do it myself, if you have you can try it." I was a boy, and I must say—not that I have any fault to find with Bishop Partridge, for he was a good man—that he did notencourage us much. We had the commandment of God on this point,to go without purse or scrip, on the one side, and the Bishop's advice on the other. I said I would not take purse or scrip, because the law of God forbid it. I and my companionstarted out. In going through Jack-son County we dared not call uponanybody, and being hungry, we wentinto a corn-field and took the ears of corn and eat the corn like horses,without grinding, though some of it we pounded. We continued our way South, and having no money,after leaving Jackson County webegged our bread from door to door;and when we asked for something we always received it, and we were never turned out of doors. I referto these things because they cometo my mind, and cannot help con-trasting in my own mind how differ-ent things were forty five years ago from what they are to-day. Brother Morgan has been telling us how they travel in the South, and I can bear testimony to what he has said, thatwhen a man goes forth trusting in God he gets along fully as well, feelsbetter, and generally has as goodsuccess as the man who goes into the missionary field with his pock-ets full of money.I traveled through Arkansas, andhad quite an experience. I hadvisions and dreams to warn me of danger and to encourage me in my labors. In one instance, a mancame towards me, intending to killme; the circumstances was shownme in a vision the night before. Amob of thirty men was raised, and they swore they would ride us on a rail, and tar and feather us, andthen hang us. My companion wasin favor of leaving the country; butI told him I was going to stay thereat the risk of my life. When the mob approached us, the leader cameforward with the intention of killingme; the consequence was precisely as had been shown me in my vision—when he got to where I was he fell dead at my feet; and it was not more than ten days when twenty of this mob took sick and died—all done by the same power and by the destroying angel who is both power-ful to save or destroy. We remainedthere until we saw the literal fulfil-ment of what had been shown mein the night vision. I held the office of a priest, while my companion wasan elder, and you know how a person would feel in those days if he rebelled against a man over him in the priest-hood. I did so, and it was the only time in my life that I ever attemptedto do such a thing. When my part-ner told me he was going to leave, I told him that he should not do so,neither would I; and I persisted in holding him there for two weeks.During this time we witnessed the hand of the Lord in preserving our lives and in slaying our enemies,and now was the time for us to go to work, but which we did not do; in that we did wrong, for after re-maining there two weeks, my com-panion said he would not stop any longer, and I dared not stay there alone, and therefore we left. If we had remained, after the door hadbeen thus opened, I have not a doubtbut what we would have raised up quite a large branch of the Church.But my companion did not wish to stop longer, the only ordinance he administered during this mission was to baptize a man and womanwho received us, Father and MotherHibber, who believed in the divinity of the Book of Mormon. The man who was struck dead at my feet was Mr. Akeman, who lived in Jackson County, Mo., during the persecu-tions, and buried is wife there.He had several sons six feet high. The old gentleman passed throughmuch, and then apostatized and went to Arkansas and settled there.It would have been better for him to have kept the faith, for he did not live long after he got there, and I do not think he got much glory either.After our two weeks' experience in this place the whole neighborhoodseemed ready to receive the gospel, and if I had stopped there, I amsatisfied that I could have built up quite a church. It is true, being a priest, I could not have confirmedbelievers after baptizing them for the remission of their sins, but I could have baptized them and ad-ministered the sacrament.Leaving this place, and having no money to travel, we went to Arkan-sas River, and there dug out a canoefrom the trunk of a cottonwood tree,and paddled ourselves a distance of one hundred and twenty-five milesdown the river. The first day wemade about forty miles, and stoppedover night with a poor woman who lived in a log cabin without a floor.She gave us supper and breakfast,and also a piece of johnny-cake and pork, which we took along. Thatday we went down to the Darda-nelles, and stopped over night in a big tavern, which was unoccupied.There was not a man within twenty miles, and when we inquired whatwas the matter, we were told the place was haunted. We tied up ourcanoe, took our lunch, asked a bless-ing on it and ate it. After dark wewent to bed, and I slept soundly, onone of the best of feather beds, (in a dream,) at my father's house, and it is hardly necessary for me to say nobody haunted us or disturbed ourslumber in the least.After a good night's rest we wenton to Little Rock and tied up ourcanoe. After visiting hero, we wenton to where a man named Joneslived, where we left our canoe, and preached the next day. We thenwalked back to Little Rock, and tak-ing the old military road, started to cross the Mississippi swamp, which was, the most part of it, coveredwith water from the place we startedto Memphis, Tennesee—a distance of about one hundred and eightymiles. We had to wade through mud and water sometimes kneedeep, which had the effect of givingme an attack of rheumatism, which crippled me. My companion was in good health and wanted to hurry on,so we parted; he left me resting on a log. I was now alone, lame and without food, in a swamp, somethirty-five miles from the nearesthouse. In considering the situation,and being all covered with mud, I could not help laughing at my con-dition—my companion leaving mesitting on a log in a swamp, thirty-five miles from any house, without food. I did not see my companionagain for two years. But, withal, I knew I needed assistance, so when my companion had gone out of sight I knelt down in the water and prayedfervently to the Lord to heal me, so that I could continue my journey.I felt the operation of the Holy Spiritupon me; I arose from my knees, the pain having left me. I then went on, bearing testimony to a family here and there wherever opportu-nity presented itself. When I came to Memphis I was there without any money. I went to the best tavernin the city, which was kept by a Mr.Jackson. I told him of my financialcondition, and asked him if he wouldkeep me over night. Said he, scan-ning me from head to foot, "What is your calling?" I said, "I am a preacher of the gospel."  He lookedat me again and burst out laughing,and then said: "You look like one."-[Laughter.]- I could not take any exceptions, because the ministers ofthe various denominations, in travel-ing over the country, were furnished with a good saddle horse, they al-ways had money and wore goodclothes. And the idea of a manwho had waded through mud andwater, and partly crippled through rheumatism, claiming to be a preacher, I could not blame him for laughing at me; in fact, I could nothelp laughing myself. Mr. Jacksonrather suspected me; I believe hethought I was one of Murvill's Clan—a set of men who were stealingnegroes and killing men. He askedme then: "How shall I know that you are a preacher?" I put my handinto my pocket, took out a paper andpresented it to him, telling him atthe same time that that was mylicense. After reading it over, andstill keeping up his laughing spell,he said: "But how shall I know that this is a genuine certificate? Will you preach?" "For mercy's sake,"said I, "don't set me a preaching."And it had the effect of makinghim feel quite curious to hear me.He took my valise out of my hand,saying that I must preach. I wasinvited into the house, and while I was resting and waiting for supper,Mr. Jackson sent all over town andinvited the "upper ten" to come and hear a "Mormon" preach; and whileI was eating supper they came,dressed in silks and satins and broad-cloth, and before I got through thehouse was full of people, who satlooking at me, no doubt expecting to be highly entertained. Supper over, the landlord intimated to me that they were ready to hear the preach-ing. I told him I was ready to preach to them. He then set mein a corner, where I was guarded by about a dozen men, who would have prevented me from jumping out ofthe window, in case I had made the the attempt to do so. I had a Bible anda hymn book. On opening the book,I asked if some one would kindly lead in singing, that I did not possessthe gift of singing. At this my congregation burst out laughing.When this subsided, I knelt downand offered prayer, and then preachedto them for one hour and a quarter; I had the best attention, the Spiritof the Lord rested mightily upon me, and I have always thought thatI preached that evening one of the best sermons I ever preached in my life. The people seemed to partakeof the spirit that rested on me, and I think I revealed to them their pri-vate life as clear as it was evershown to them; and I knew this,because I could read them as they sat before me. When I got through I was left standing alone; and in ashort time the house was cleared,and the landlady came and showed me to bed. Where I slept was anupper room next to a wholesale store;and in the next room was a compa-ny of men discussing the merits of the sermon, and the partition beingof board, I could hear all that wassaid. Among other things, I heardone saying: "Jim, how in h—lldid that stranger know what you were about?" After talking consid-erably they began to dispute amongthemselves, when one of them said,"Let us have the preacher up to de-cide it."  "No," said the landlord,"we have had enough of him forone night." I went on to MiddleTennessee and labored there oneyear, and preached and baptized a great many people before I was or-dained an elder. I afterwards I wasordained an elder by Warren Par-rish, and a seventy by D. W. Patten.I ordained Brother Smoot and Ben-jamin Clapp as elders. All my travel-ing was done without purse or scrip; and God was with me, although a young man, and revealed unto mehis mind and will.And here let me say to our young deacons, teachers and priests, I hadas much of the power of God with me, and was blessed with as much of his spirit, while I held the Aaronicpriesthood as when an apostle. I had as much of his power to helpme to preach and to deliver mefrom the grasp of my enemies as I ever had since. I say this for theencouragement of our young men and our boys who are called to the priesthood; and I would say to them,fill your position, magnify your call-ing in humility before God, and seekafter him in your youth, and also seek to prepare yourselves for futureusefulness in the great work which lies before you, and the Lord willwork through you, making you hon-ored instruments in helping to bringto pass his great and eternal pur-poses with regard to the salvation ofmankind and the overthrow of wick-edness in the earth.While it occurs to me I will relateone little circumstance which tookplace after I had been out two years.Elders David W. Patten and WarrenParrish had been laboring together in Tennessee. Elder Patten had re-turned to Kirtland, leaving Brother Parrish in charge of the branches ofthe Church throughout the Southerncountry. And while laboring underBrother Parrish, and still holdingthe Aaronic priesthood, I received a letter from Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, informing me that they wished Brother Parrish to comehome, and me to remain in chargein his stead; and among other things,Brother Joseph said to me, "I willpromise you, in the name of the Lord, that by so doing you shall loseno blessing that would otherwise beconferred upon you." Just beforeBro. Parrish left he ordained me anelder, and during that year afterBro. Parish left I baptized somethirty persons. When I receivedthe letter referred to from the Prophet Joseph, I was in BrotherSmoot's house; he was there andhad read my letter. I rememberhow well I felt at the promises that had been made to me; and when bedtime came I retired to the smallroom which I occupied, shut the door, and soon received a heavenly vision. Here let me say with regardto seeing visions; when Joseph Smithreceived the visitation of Moroni,Peter, James and John and others,they came and talked with him as one man talks with another, face to face. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:30-47##] [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] In other cases men have beenwrapt in vision, as, for instance,Paul, when describing his state, saidthat he did not know whether he was in the body or out of the body,but he saw and heard things not tobe uttered. [##2 Corinthians 12:3##] And it was so with me;I could not tell whether I was in the body or out of the body; but one thing I do know, I was not asleep.  I saw a great many things in thatvision which were truly wonderful.I saw the resurrection of the dead;I saw the sun turned to darkness,and the moon to blood, and the starsfrom heaven fall. I saw seven gold-en lions sit in the heavens as burningbrass, and the angel told me thatthey were representatives of the different dispensations. These arethings I hardly ever talk about, and I only do so now because it is in the line of my remarks, and becausethey come to my mind. If I had been a painter, the next morningwhen I awoke, or even to this day—as the scene has a lasting remem-brance on my mind—I could havesat down and portrayed these glori-ous things; they made a muchstronger impression on my mindthan if I had learned them from books. I name this to show you, my young brethren, that it makesno difference what office a manholds, or what his condition in life may be, as long as he trusts in the Lord and he magnifies the office heholds, no matter what may be thatcalling. This was the manner inwhich we traveled in early days, and we had joy in our labor, the Lord blessing us with souls for ourhire. I traveled all over the coun-try, comprising a circuit of somethree hundred or four hundred miles,and labored there two years. I builtup a number of branches of the Church, and among others I bap-tized a Campbellite preacher and agood many of his flock. When I returned to Kirtland I took BrotherSmoot with me; I was there whenthe endowments were given in the winter of 1836-7, and received many blessings at the hands of the Lord.  In this respect I certainly realizedthe fulfilment of the promises mademe by the Prophet Joseph when Iwas requested to remain in the Southern country to take charge ofthe branches of the Church in thatland.I was in Kirtland at the time of the great apostacy, which some ofyou have read of in the history. Men have asked me why men whohave borne the apostleship haveapostatized. I would ask, why domen apostatize to-day? Becausethey set their hearts upon the thingsof this world, which in time alien-ate them from God and from the duties of the holy priesthood; andthis was the case with them. The key to this matter may be had by reading the letter written by the Prophet Joseph when confined in Liberty Jail; it plainly states whymen apostatize. Many are called,but few are chosen. And why arethey not chosen? Because they settheir hearts too much upon the things of this world, and aspire tothe honors of men. That was the case with some of the first quorumof the Twelve. I hold in my hand a copy of the Book of Mormon, the truthfulness and divinity of which is attested to by the signatures of eleven men, and yet there was notone of these witnesses, exceptingthe three Smiths and Hiram Page, but what turned against Joseph.They did not deny their testimony to the truth of the Book of Mormon;on the contrary, they maintainedtheir position in that respect to the last moment of their life; butthey rebelled against and opposed the Prophet Joseph, and consequently they fell, and will be found undercondemnation. When men under-take to use their priesthood asidefrom its legitimate purposes—thebuilding up of the kingdom of God—the Spirit of God is grieved, and the heavens withdraw themselves,and then "amen" to the priesthoodand authority of such men. It mat-ters not who the man may be, or howgreat his influence in the commu-nity, he must sooner or later fall a prey to the devourer of souls. Andon the other hand, when men hold-ing this holy priesthood magnify it, it becomes a power and a key in them, and they have power beforeGod and the heavens.I was in Kirtland during that darkhour through which the Church passed. Brother Joseph hardly knewwho his friends were when he metthem, whether they were membersof the quorum of the Twelve, high priests, seventies, the witnesses to the Book of Mormon, or any oneelse. It was the darkest day this Church has ever known, as far asthe power of apostacy is concened;and I hope and trust it will neveragain be repeated to the same extent,although men may continue to apostatize, when they forsake Godand his cause. And while things were in this state, the Spirit of God said to me, leave this place, go to the islands of the sea and preachthe everlasting gospel, and let the scenes in Kirtland take care of them-selves. I had not taken counselwith anybody, but I went to Brig-ham Young and Brother Kimballand stated to them my feelings. Brothers Rigdon and Kimball saidgo. And afterwards Brother Kim-ball desired me to remain with him,and help him turn his house around.I stayed with him two days, andthen started off on my mission, the results of which I have very briefly alluded to.I also traveled through Canada in company with John Allen Hale andMilton Holmes, whom I chose as my associates. Bro. Hale was notwhat was called a great preacher,but was a good man, who could beartestimony to the divinity of the gospel we preach. I preached and baptized some in Canada. Bro. JohnE. Page was there at the time; he was afterwards chosen a member ofthe quorum of the Twelve, but wasamong those who afterwards aposta-tized. Traveling through Canada,I went through Oswego, took the canal and went to Connecticut to my father's house. I had not seenmy parents from the time I em-braced the goospel, a period of somefive years. Before starting out on my mission, however, I went to see Fa-ther Smith, the patriarch, who blessed me and he gave me thepromise that I should be successfulin bringing my father's house intothe church. When I called upon him I preached to him and baptized him and my stepmother and my uncle, Ozam Woodruff and wife and son and my step-sister, togetherwith others who lived in my father's house.I then went to Fox Island, whereI organized a branch of the church. When we landed there at midnightwe were entire strangers without asingle penny. The first house we approached we found vacant; wewent on to the next, where wewere accommodated with a bed.The next morning I said to the lady,"Will you tell me if there is any re-ligion on this island, and if so,what?" She answered "the Bap-tist religion." "Have you a church?""Yes, a Baptist church." "Have you a minister?" "Yes, a Bap- 
 DISCOURSEBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,In the Salt Lake Assemby Hall,Sunday Afternoon, December12th, 1880.REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.WHEN we hear a young man get upin our midst—twenty-six years of age—and say that he was born andreared in this city, it conveys to ourminds in a limited measure some-thing of the length of time we havedwelt here, something of the age ofour city. In fact, when I contem-plate our position in thse moun-tains, when I look back to the 24thof July, 1847, when we as pioneerscame into this barren desert, thetime appears very short to me. Wehad never lived anywhere until wecame into these mountains but avery short time in a place; in fact,quarter of the time that our brotherhas lived here in this city since hisbirth would limit us in our existencein any city or town almost wheneverwe have lived.It is interesting to me as an indi-vidual to listen to the testimonies ofour young elders who have beenborn and reared in the land of Zion,who never saw Babylon, nor theworld, until they were sent abroadupon their missions. It is interest-ing to me to reflect upon our positionand condition as a people here in themountains of Israel, in fulfilmentof the words of the Lord.There has been a great deal saidby our enemies since the organiza-tion of this church concerning JosephSmith; concerning the Book of Mor-mon having been written by Spauld-ing as a novel; and of this work be-ing a deception. Yet, after all, it israther a wonder to the world thatan illiterate boy like Joseph Smith,if he was not taught by the God of Israel and by the spirit of revelation,could possess the power to bringforth such principles as are recordedin the Book of Mormon and in theBook of Doctrine and Covenants,and to organize a system of govern-ment, a system of religion, a systemof the church upon the face of theearth, that was far beyond all the combined power of the while Chris-tian world. You may take all thelearned men of the earth, all thedoctors of divinity, with all theknowledge that they possess, putthem all together, and they had notthe power to organize such a church as has been organized by JosephSmith.This should be some evidence, alittle evidence at least, to the world,and to the unbeliever, that there issomething connected with Mormon-ism that they do not comprehendand understand. Let any man takethe Book of Mormon and read itthrough from beginning to end—readthat history, read what the prophetssay upon the principle of faith, hope and Charity, the administrations ofJesus Christ upon this land, the or-ganization of the Church, and themiracles wrought here upon the landof American—and let them ask them-selves if they suppose that SolomonSpaulding could sit down in a cornerand write a novel covering theseprinciples? No; they know better.Any reflecting mind on earth knowsvery well that the Book of Mormonnever orginated from a source ofthat kind, any more than they canaccuse the Bible of having beenbrought forth by the same cause. Ifone orginiated from God, the otherdid.Again. Let any man read theBook of Doctrine and Covenants; lethim read the revelations thereingiven, and he will find the strongestlanguage, the most sublime language,that God every revealed to man. Thereis no language I ever read in anyrecord given to the human family,that will compare with the sublimityand power of these revelations giventhrough that boy, Joseph Smith.Read the revelation called the "OliveLeaf;" read any of the revelationsgiven in the early days of the pro-phet, and you will find them full ofthe power of God, full of eternalprinciples. Read the prayer of Jo-seph Smith in Liberty Jail, and theanswer of the Lord unto him; takethe very least of any of the revela-tions recorded in that book, and seeif any man could go to work and getup anything of the kind. Do theysound anything like the compositionsof a man trying to write a novel?No; they are the word of the Lord,and the Spirit of God bears record ofthe truths it contains.We have every cause as the Saintsof the living God to exercise faith inthe revelations of heaven, and in thefulfilment of his promises unto usas Latter-day Saints. In fact, asthe Apostle James has said, "Faith,if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. Yea, a man may say, I havefaith, but do not believe in works:shew me thy faith without thyworks, and I will shew thee my faithby my works." The Saints of God—and I believe myself all Gods andall inteligent beings from eternityto eternity—have all had to exercisethis principle of faith. "Faith is thesubstance of things hoped for, theevidence of things not seen." Byfaith we understand the worlds weremade. God spake, chaos heard, and the world came into order. I believethat our Heavenly Father, and allintelligent beings in the heavenshave to exercise faith in their laborsthe same as the inhabitants of theearth. I believe it is an eternal principle, that has existed from eter-nity to eternity, and will exist for-ever, not only on earth withmortal beings, but in the eternalworld of immortal beings. In theBible we have many examples ofwhat the ancient apostles and pro-phets performed by faith. Noah,being warned of God, went to workand built an ark, but owing to thewickedness and unbelief of the peo-ple, only eight souls were savedfrom the flood. The same principleof faith exists with us. It has beenby faith that this assembly has beenbrought here to-day. What wouldhave been our condition, if whenwe heard the gospel in our own coun-try, we had not exercised faith?Why, would we have stayed in ourown country; Utah would have beenas barren as we found it in 1847.Had there not been faith in the pro-clamation of the gospel of Christ,both with the preacher and with thehearer; had there not been the Spiritof God to back up the testimony of the elders of Israel in their laborsabroad among the nations of theearth, nobody would have gatheredhere to these valleys of the moun-tains. But it has been the work ofthe Almighty. It is in accordancewith the decrees of God to establishhis kingdom upon the earth in thelatter days. Joseph Smith wascalled by revelation. He labored infaith. Angels of God taught him.He received instructions from theseholy messengers; but notwithstand-ing all this, he had to exercise faithin the organization of the church, inthe calling of men to the ministry,and in sending them forth to the nat-tions of the earth—all these thingshad to be performed by faith asmuch as a man who plants grain.The farmer sows his wheat, or any-thing else, believing that it willgrow. If the elders had not believedthat God had called them, that theLord would sustain and uphold them,they never would have gone abroadupon their missions. But the prin-ciple of faith has been exercised bythis people, and we must still con-tinue to exercise it. The Lord iswith us. The Lord has set his handto build up his kingdom. He isgathering a people from the nationsof the earth to Zion. He has set hishand to establish it in its beauty,power and strength, and I have be-lieved, and believe still, that the Lord will not disappoint us, nor willhe disappoint this generation; "buta litte one will become a thousand,and a small one a strong nation. Ithe Lord, will hasten it in its time."We should labor to exercise thisprinciple of faith in our lives. Wemay look forward for the fulfilmentof all the prophecies and promiseswhich had been made since the world began concerning this genera-tion. There are many things whichhave been reserved from the creationof the world, to be revealed in thelast dispensation and fulness oftimes. We have not got throughreceiving revelation. The Lord hasa great many things to reveal in thelatter days, when we are preparedas a people to receive them.I rejoice in the progress of thework of God. I rejoice in listeningto the testimonies of the elders ofIsrael. A new generation has risen upsince we came to these valleys ofthe mountains. The Lord hasraised up the sons and daughters ofprophets, apostles and elders andfathers in Zion; and as I often re-mark to our young men they have got to round up their shoulders andbear off this kingdom. The workwill not stop because men die. Itmatters not who dies. When theProphet Joseph Smith was takenaway—I was going to say the saintsthemselves felt as though all waslost. The world supposed thatwould be the end of Mormonisim.It is true the death of Joseph Smithcaused mourning to rest upon all theLatter-day Saints, but that did notstop the work of God. Joseph Smithlived until he obtained all the keysof the kingdom of God which be-longed to this generation, and sealedthem upon the heads of other men.The Lord called him to the otherside of the vail to unlock the prisondoors; but his dying did not stop thework of God. When President Young was called away the worldhad the same views. People had anidea that when Brigham Young diedthat would be the end of Mormon-ism; that the apostles and leaderswould quarrel as to who should leadthe Church; that Mormonism wouldall break up and go to the devil.But they were entirely disappointedin this. As I have already said, itmakes not difference who dies, wheth-er it be Wilford Woodruff, OrsonPratt, President John Taylor or any one else, there will always be some-body to lead the Church, Israle willnever be without a law-giver fromthis time henceforth and forever.Zion will continue to progress, and the God of Israel will sustain her nomatter what the feelings of worldmay be, not matter how much opposi-tion there may be to the kingdomof God. I should be sorry if theworld were of one heart and mindwith us. I would fear and tremble if such were the case; for the Lordhas said, "I have chosen you out of theworld, therefore the world hatethyou. If they have persecuted me,they will persecute you also." Welook upon perscution, then, as thelegacy that has been given to theSaints of God in their day and genera-tion. But there is one thing that Ithink we should exercise faith in,and that is in the perpetuity of thisChurch and kingdom: and in thedestiny of the Latter-day Saints; inthe fulfilment of prophecy and re-velation in regard to what God hasdecreed upon the earth in this great and last dispensation. We shouldexercise faith in these things. If itwere not for this we should be inthe same condition as other genera-tions have been. But as the Lordlives there is no power on earth, orunder the earth, that has power, orever will have power, to stay theprogress of this Church and kingdomor destroy it from off the earth be-cause the God of heaven has decreedit, and the little stone cut out of themountains without hands will rollforth and fill the whole earth, nomatter what opposition is broughtto bear against it. No other dispen-sations on earth have had this privi-lege, and this has strengthened us, itstrengthened Joseph Smith, BrighamYoung, and the elders, of Israel.Amond the first things Moroni in-stilled into Joseph Smith beforehe received the priesthood before theorganization of this was the prophe-cies of Isaiah, and told him that theday had come when the God ofheaven was about to set up his king-dom on earth never more to bethrown down. The lord had de-creed that this should take place andit must come to pass. Joseph Smithbelieved the testimony of Moroni. He believed the testimony of theangel whom God had sent to admin-ister to him. He taught those prin-ciples to his brethren, and his breth-ren believed them. The apostles intheir travels abroad, notwithstandingthe difficulties they had to overcomeupon their early missions, had theseprinciples continually before them.We have them before us to-day; andI know as God lives that the proph-ecies will be fulfilled concerning theestablishment of the kingdom of Godin the latter-days. It was this king-dom of our God that the ProphetIsaiah, in looking down to our dayand generation, exclaimed, "Sing,O heaven; and be joyful, O earth;break forth into singing, O, ye moun-tains: for the Lord hath comfortedhis people, and will have mercy uponhis afflicted. But Zion said, TheLord hath forsaken me, and my Godhas forgotten me. Can a womanforget her sucking child, that sheshould not have compassion on theson of her womb? Yea, they may for-get, yet will I not forget thee."Why? Because Zion has been beforethe Lord from the creation of theworld, and the day has come to buildit up. The prophets saw it; theybelieved in. We see it: we believeit, for we have faith in God. Weshould labor to build up this Zion dur-ing the little time we dwell here. Wehave been prospered, we are blessed;and the Zion of our God is held inthe hands of the Almighty or wewould not have power to gatherhere. Were it not that we are sus-tained by Almighty God, we wouldnot have power to build these tem-ples, to fill the mountains with citiesand towns and villages and gardensand orchards, and raise crops andflocks and herds as we have done.These things are the gifts of God un-to us, and it is all in the great pro-gramme of the last dispensation, thefulness of times.But, says the world, what are yougoing to do when a great nation likethe United States say you shall notdo these things, you shall not dwellhere and enjoy your religion? Well,I will tell you what we are going todo—we are going to trust in God,that is what we are going to do, andif this nation with its fifty millions of inhabitants has more power thanGod, then Zion will fail, the kingdomof God will fall, and all the purposesof the Almighty will come to an end.It just hinges right there. TheLord thus far has never failed inhis promises, it is the Lord and thenation for it. I think the Lord holdsthe most power. He holds the des-tiny of this and every other nationin his hands. I know he has madecertain promises in regard to this land of Zion. He has fulfilled manyof these promises already. It isupon this principle that we havebuilt these tabernacles and are erect-ing these temples. We are tryingto keep the commandments of God,and we shall continue to do so untilthe kingdom of God is establishedupon the earth to be thrown downno more forever.We expectd to be subject to all con-stitutional laws of the land and main-tain the constitution of our countrywhich we believe was given by in-spiration and guarantees unto allmen the right to worship God accord-ing to the dictates of their own con-science. That is about all I wanted to say. I desire, however, to bearmy testimony to the truth of thiswork. No man will ever gain any-thing by taking a stand against thiskingdom. The Lord is going tobreak in pieces every weapon that isformed against Zion. He is goingto do another thing, too, and that isevery nation, kindred, tongue andpeople that does not serve the Lordin the latter days will be cut off;for the Lord God hath spoken it.Now, these are solemn sayings, butthey are neverthe less true.I want the Latter-day Saints toexercise faith in God. I want themto be true and faithful, and not fearwhat man can do. In the Scriptureswe read: "Fear not them who havepower to kill the body, but are notable to kill the soul; but rather fearhim who is able to destroy both souland body in hell." That is a beingwe should all fear to sin against; andI rejoice when I see our young men,the rising generation of Zion, will-ing to take upon them the name ofChrist, willing to go forth and bearrecord of the gospel of Jesus Christ,willing to magnify the holy priest-hood; for our young men have thiswork to do. I hope, therefore, they will qualify themselves for the workof the ministry. We are not goingto stay here always. Many of ourbrethren have passed away. I ex-pect to follow them; I have nevercomtemplated anything else. Thereis none of us going to stay in theworld without death. The law ofdeath is upon all mankind, and allwill meet it in some shape or other.Even Elijah, Moses, the inhabitantsof the city of Enoch, and the threeNephites, who had a change comeover them and are on the earth to-day, and perhaps visit us occation-ally—understood this.I desire during the few days I mayremain on the earth, to do all thegood I can. I want to strengthenthe faith of the Latter-day Saints; Iwant to encourage the rising genera-tion to keep the faith and qualifythemselves to inherit eternal life.We have started out for celestialglory. The man who rejects lightand truth may pay the penalty ofso doing, and will be deprived of theprivilege of going into the presenceof God and the Lamb. If the worldcould only see and comprehend thesethings, they would not treat lightlythe testimony of the servants of God. But the devil rules over hisown kingdom; the Lord will ruleover his Saints.I pray God, my Heavenly Father,to bless us, that we may be faithfulto our God, faithful to the covenantswe have made; that we may exercisefaith in the Lord, and overcome theworld, the flesh, and the devil, andinherit eternal life, for Jesus' sake.Amen.

Price One Penny.DISCOURSEDELIVERED BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF AT THE GENERAL CONFER-ENCE, SALT LAKE CITY, ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON, APRIL 7, 1887.(Reported by Arthur Winter.)WHILE the Sacrament is being passed to this congregation, I will try tomake a few remarks; but whether ornot I shall be heard by this assemblyI cannot say.If after the scene we have passed through during the last hour any mancan answer his mind and satisfy him-self before an assembly of this kindto occupy the position that I do, un-less he is assisted by the God of Is-rael, he is made of different materialto what I am.  That which we havehad before us this afternoon is a testi-mony to heaven and earth that whathas been presented here could nothave been witnessed in the midst ofany other people on the face of theearth, unless that people were thechildren of God.  Here we have hadten thousand men and women lift uptheir hands in a vote to sustain notonly the Presidency of the Churchand the Twelve Apostles, but othermen in their various positions, andwithout a dissenting vote.  Where onthe earth can a scene of this kind beseen except among the Latter-daySaints?I feel it my privilege, right andduty to now make a few remarkswith regard to myself and the deal-ings of God with me.  But beforedoing that I will say that the Lordhas never set His hand, in any age ofthe world, to perform a work amongthe sons of Adam, but He has pre-pared an element for that work.  Youwill see this in the whole history ofHis dealings with the human family.It is so in the generation in which welive.  The God of heaven, having setHis hand to carry out His great pur-poses and decrees, which have beenrevealed in the records of Divinetruth, has been under the necessityof preparing a people to take hold ofand to perform the work which Hehas decreed should come to pass.  Tenthousand of that people are beforeme to-day, with tens of thousands throughout the land.

It is the kingdomDaniel sayw in vision; it is the kingdompointed out by all the prophets andapostles in days gone by. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] And you lookat the history and travels of this people:look at the progress made in the midstof oppression and opposition of Presidents,of Congress, of priest and people, andwe can see how we have been sustainedby the hand of Almighty God, and notby the hand of man. This will continue.As I before said I have no fears with 
 AN ADDRESS FROM PRESI-DENT WOODRUFFIN RELATION TO THE MANTI TEMPLE.SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 20th, 1887.To the Presidents of Stakes, Bishopand Saints generally:It is with profound feelings of grat-itude and thanksgiving to our heaven-ly Father that we announce to the Latter-day Saints that the Templewhich is being erected at Manti hasbeen so nearly completed as to beready for the upholstering, furniture,carpets, etc., which are necessary toput it in a state of complete prepara-tion for the sacred labors to be per-formed therein. This is the thirdbuilding of this character which in thekind providence of God theLatter-day Saints have been per-mitted to erect and finish inthese mountains. The Templeat Salt Lake City is also progressing ina satisfactory manner, which, whenfinished, will be the fourth Templethat has been constructed by theSaints under the direction of the Al-mighty since we came to these val-leys.How blesed are the peope whohave had these glorious privilegesgranted unto them! Our hearts swellwith inexpressible feelings of thanks-giving and joy to our Father in heaventhat he has permitted His Saints tobuild these houses. They now haveopportunities to act as Saviors of theirfellowmen, which but few genera-tions of the children of men have everenjoyed. The great work of the res-toration of the dead which will occupythe time and thought of fu-ture [8]generations has now begun,never more to end until the earth issanctified and the plan of salvation de-vised in the eternal worlds for humanredemption is fully consummated.Our object in addressing you in this circular is to present to all the members of the Church the opportunity ofcontributing, according to their meansand liberality, something towards thefurnishing of the Manti Temple. Heretofore the contributions for that build-ing have been confined to the Stakeswhich are numbered in what is knownas the "Manti Temple District." Be-fore the Logan Temple was completedan opportunity was given to theSaints to contribute towardsthe purchasing of its furnishings, fur-niture, etc. They gladly responded tothe call which was made upon them.We feel that they will, on the presentoccasion appreciate the privilege ofcontributing in like manner towardsthe purchasing of suitable upholstery,carpetings, etc., for the Manti Temple.The funds of the Superintendent areexhausted; and contracts are alreadymade for needed articles, which haveto be met at an early date.Contributions will be taken fromtwenty-five cents upwards, so thatthose who are the most limited inmeans need not be debarred, whilethose who are more wealthy, can havethe satisfaction and pleasure ofmaking donations according to theirability for the completion of thisnoble edifice. We would like thePresidents and Bishops to give everyone an opportunity of doing some-thing in this direction, and the namesof all, with the amounts contributed,should be carefuly taken.We would like to see the names ofevery man, woman and child in the Church recorded in the Archives ofthe Temple as having contributedsomething towards its erection andcompletion.These funds with the donors' names,can either be forwarded to the office ofthe Presiding Bishop or to the ChiefClerk—Brother James Jack, at thePresident's Office.It is important that these collectionsshould be made and remitted aspromptly as possible, as the need forthis means is pressing.WILFORD WOODRUFF,In behalf of the Council of the Apos-tles.

We wereastonished beyond measure. What is the cause of this intensity of pur-pose and concert of action? I will tell you.

 776 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1896,AN ADDRESS.To the officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:Dear Brethren and Sisters—It has been a practice in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sanctioned by the word of the Lord, to fast and pray, and in this manner to seek for that faith which Saintsshould possess, and obtain that spirit of humility which we are com-manded to cultivate.Shortly after the arrival of the people in the valley of the Great SaltLake, the first Thursday in each month was set apart as a day of fastingand prayer.  The members of the Church were enjoined to bring on that day their contributions for the relief and sustenance of the poor, and hand them to the Bishop of the ward.At the time of the adoption of this regulation it was very convenientfor the people generally to meet together in their places of worship on that day.  The conditions were such that they, being of one faith, employersand employed, could leave their labor and devote a few hours to the Lord.For many years these meetings were well attended, and they were of a most interesting character, and were a comfort and a strength to all who shared in them, as it was the practice for persons of both sexes to beartheir testimony and take active part in them in each ward under the direction of the bishopric.As the years rolled by, conditions changed, and it became more difficultfor the people generally, and especially those in steady employment to attend these meetings, until at the present time they have dwindled to such an extent that comparatively few have the opportunity of attendingthem.  Thursday as a day of fasting and prayer in the church no longer serves the object for which it was intended.Our attention has been called to this subject, and after mature delibera-tion, it has been decided to change the day that has heretofore been devoted to this purpose.  Instead of the customary assemblages in the various wards throughout Zion on the first Thursday in each month, we have concluded to set apart the first Sunday in every month as the day for the regular fast meeting.Hereafter, therefore, we desire the Latter-day Saints, under the direction of the Presidents of Stakes and the Bishops, to meet in their several places of worship on the afternoon of the first Sunday in each month, whenever it can be done conveniently, and devote the meeting to the administration 
 35regard to Zion, and the church of JesusChrist of Latter-day-Saints. All thefears I have is ^are^ with regard to ourselves.The Lord can build up his kingdom withfew or many men.

I hope I may have the faith and prayers of theSaints of God unto this end.I have some things upon my mind that I would like to speak of thisafternoon, if I can get the spirit of them. I will say that some of the most interesting histoy of my life has been the time that I have spenthere in St. George, and in the Temple of God which was built here. Thereis no eye that has seen, nor ear that has heard, nor has it entered into theheart of man to conceive, the future reward that will be given these peoplewho dwell here and who have labored in the Temple of God. For myself,I can say that I feel under deep obligation to the people who dwell here - an obligation that I feel will last with me throughout all eternity. In myearly days there were two things for which I desired to live. One was theredemption of the dead - my father's house, my mother's house, and theprogenitors who are in the spirit world, and who never heard the Gospel.I have been preserved in the flesh, as one of their descendants, to hold thekeys of their salvation and redemption, the same as you have for yourprogenitors, whom you are called to redeem and labor for here in the fleshThis has been a work that I have greatly desired to do for years that arepast and gone, and through the blessing of the Lord and the assistance of my brethren and sisters who dwell in St. George, I have lived to see itaccomplished to a great extent, which I look upon as one of the greatestblessings God ever bestowed upon me. So I look upon it with regard to all of us.The Lord has had certain purposes in gathering us together, and the re-demption of our dead is one of them. And when I reflect upon the workwhich the Latter-day Saints have been called to perform in these latterdays, I rejoice before the Lord that I have lived in this day and generation,and that I have been numbered among the Latter-day Saints who havebeen called to perform these great and mighty works which are necessaryto be performed before the coming of the Son of Man.The building of these Temples in these mountains of Israel is among themarvelous events of the day in which we live. Of course, we built Temples before we came to these valleys; one in Kirtland, and one in Nauvoo. I was not at the dedication of the Temple in Kirtland ; but I was present at the dedication of the Temple in Nauvoo. The history ofthese Temples you have before you. You know the Prophets were slain,and the Lord required the building of that Temple at the hands of theSaints before they were driven into the wilderness. There was a certainrevelation given that inspired in a great measure the Elders of the Churchof God to perform that work. They labored with all the power theypossessed, and they accomplished that work. They went into that Temple and received ordinances and endowments before they left to go into thewilderness. These Temples that we have built here stand as a monument before God, angels and men, to the faith and works of the Latter-daySaints.Brother George Q. Cannon has referred to your labors in settling here. 
 338     LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STARWith regard to myself, I will saythat in my early youth, while read-ing the Bible---the record of Judah,and the New Testament---I read ofJesus Christ, of His Apostles, theirworks, and the dealings of God withthem, and of the doctrines whichthey received and taught to thosearound them.  There was somethingglorious in those principles which theSavior of the world and His disciplestaught in their day.  I had a greatdesire in my boyhood and youth thatI might live to behold a people whowere inspired of the Almighty, andwho had power and authority to goforth and teach those principles whichI read of within the lids of the Bible.At that time I could not hear themtaught.  They were not taught byany person within my knowledge.But, as I have said, I had a longingdesire that I might live to behold apeople on the earth who would teachthese principles to me.  I spent manya midnight hour in my mill, andamong the rocks, in the forests and inthe fields, in pouring out my soul toGod and praying that I might live tobehold a people on the earth who would teach these principles.  Inanswer to my prayers, the God ofheaven promised me that I shouldlive to find such a people.  He pro-mised me that I should have a nameand a place within the House of Godand among His people---a name thatshould not be cut off.  I am stronglyimpressed to-day, in reflecting uponour history and the history of myself,and the position which I occupy, withthe promises of God to me in thoseearly days.  They have been fulfilled,and this day has crowned the pinna-cle of the responsibility which isplaced upon my head. I marvelwhen I contemplate these things, which are in fulfillment of the pro-mises of God unto me. And when Isay this of myself, I speak of hun-dreds of the Elders of Israel whohave been moved upon in the samemanner that I have been.  Thosewith whom I stood connected in theearly period of the Church---the Pro-phet Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, and those men that laid the founda-tion of this Church and kingdom,together with other prophets andpatriarchs---have passed away.  Theyare on the other side of the veil.  Istill have the privilege of remaining,and I this day have been called tothis responsibility in the midst ofmy brethren---a responsibility that noman can fill unless he is inspired ofGod.But I will say this to my brethrenand sisters, in the name of Israel'sGod:  The Almighty will never per-mit me, nor any other President whoholds the keys of the kingdom ofGod, to lead you astray.  If I do notwalk in the paths of righteousnessand do what is right in the positionthat I occupy, He will remove me outof my place, or any other man whoattempts  to lead the people astray.The position which I occupy, andthat occupied by my brethren theApostles, should not have a tendency,if we have the Spirit of God, to makeus lifted up or exalted in our spiritsbefore the Lord.  I know, as the Godof Israel lives, that I have no power,nor have I had, in this Church, toperform any work pertaining to thiskingdom, until it has been given untome by the God of heaven.  I knowJoseph Smith had not, nor BrighamYoung, nor John Taylor, nor anyApostle or Elder in this Church andkingdom.  And the moment that Iattempt to become lifted up in thepride of my heart, because of anyposition that I hold, that moment I become a very unwise man.  So withanyone else.  The higher our posi-tion the more responsibility.  Du-ring the little time I may spend herein the flesh, I stand in need of theprayers of the Latter-day Saints---ofthose who have faith in God.  So domy brethren that surround me.  Sodo all the authorities of the Church.We all stand in need of the HolyGhost and the power of God.  With-out this we are not qualified to fillthe positions which we are called tooccupy.I know that this is the work ofGod.  So do all you who have everhad the testimony of the Holy Ghostwith you.  The God of heaven hasset His hand to establish His king-dom, in fulfillment of the revelationsof heaven which He has inspired mento declare and put on record from

Vol. LX. Thursday, June 23, 1898. Price One Penny.DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.THE following discourse was delivered by President Wilford Woodruff at the Sixty-Eighth Annual Conference, in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,Utah, on Sunday afternoon, April 3rd, 1898.-[At President Woodruff's request, President Cannon read the 1st Section of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.]-I want the attention and the prayers of the Saints who have assembled upon this occasion. I have been sick and very weak in my body for a month past, and did not feel that I would be able to attend this Confer-ence till the day before it opened. I have been blessed in this respect tobe with you. I desire to say some things to you, and perhaps somestrange things, too. I feel disposed to say something about myself, to give you a little of the history of my life, because of what I may wantto say, before I get through, to the rising generation of Israel. My re-marks may be very eccentric to any but Latter-day Saints, and to them also, I expect.I suppose when I was born the devil knew what I should be called to do; for there have been from the day I was born until the present two powers with me—one to kill me, the other to save me. I stand beforeyou to-day pretty sound-looking, for a man ninety-one years of age. I stand before you with a body in which almost every bone has been broken, except my back and neck. I have had through my life a power after me to take my life. When I was about three years old I was pushed into a caldron of boiling water, which had just been taken off the fire. Mygrandmother took me out, and my skin all dropped off excepting off myhead and feet. I was wrapped up for months in cotton and oil. That was the beginning of my troubles. When I was twelve years of age Iwas drowned; at any rate, I lay in thirty feet of water long enough to 
 will be to you that this work has beenpushed by the sisters. Why I cannottell but this I know it has takenmuch prayer and supplication toGod to carry the work thus far andwhile we have the foundation laidhere to compel the reorganizationto assist in establishing the poorin Zion, yet we must have moremeans or some to supply thepresent need. The cause of a womanbeing chosen to begin and perhapsdirect the work for the present (subjectto the criticism or counsel of anymember of the church or any partof it) ^so far as they shall know of it^ is for the purpose of doingthe work so quietly that the headsof the church who are now Jealousbecause the Lord has condi^s^cendedto listen to the pleadings of honeof his handmaids (when she knewnot what else to do but go to the Lord) 
 36here ^ are of the seed of Ephraim who have been scattered among the nations^ have been sifted as grain is sifted ^whose lives have been hid with Christ in God^through a seive. ^and they knew it not.^ When the gospel cameto them they received it and have gatheredto this land. Hence we should be onthe watch tower. We should laborfaithfully in the work allotted to us. Itis an individual matter. My apostatizingis not going to stop the progress of thiskingdom. Men have tried to use theholy priesthood to build themselves up,and the consequence has been that thespirit of God has been withdrawn fromthem and another has taken theirbishopric, crown, and kingdom. And^this^ will be so ^the case^ throughout the whole programmeof this Church and kingdom. No man

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.   777of the Sacrament, to the bearing of testimony by the members of the Church, to the blessing of children and the confirming of members in the Church, and to such other services as have usually been attended to at such meetings.  We feel assured that excellent results will follow the giving of members of the Church an opportunity to bear their testimony to each other and to seek for the gifts which the Lord has promised to those who keep His commandments.Care should also be taken on such occasions to see that the wants of the poor are relieved by the contributions of the Saints in their behalf, that no cry of the indigent or suffering shall arise from our land in the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.In Salt Lake City, instead of the people meeting in the Tabernacle onthe afternoon of the first Sunday in each month, we have concluded that it will be better for that service to be dispensed with, and for the Latter-day Saints to meet in their several wards on that afternoon, so as to give all the members of the ward, including the aged and infirm, and others who are unable to go the Tabernacle, an opportunity to participate in the fast meeting and share in the blessings of the occasion.  In otherStakes where general meetings are held as in this city, we suggest that they also be dispensed with on the first Sunday of each month, and thatthe Saints meet in their places of worship in the several wards.In some places the custom has arisen to consider it a fast to omit eatingbreakfast.  This is not in accordance with the views and practice of the past.  When fasts were observed in the early days, it was the rule to not partake of food from the previous day until after the meeting in the aftrnoon of the fast day.  In making donations to the poor also it hasbeen the understanding that the food that would be necessary for the two meals should be donated to the poor, and as much more as those who are liberally inclined and have the means may feel disposed to give.In giving this counsel to the Church upon this subject, we include all the missions where the Elders are laboring, either in the United States or in foreign lands.  We think this arrangement will suit the convenience and circumstances of all the Latter-day Saints throughout the world, and we would like it to be observed by all the organized branches of the Church in every land, so that our fasting and praying may be uniform and the time be understood by all.Before closing this address to the Saints, we feel led to say that if there should be sickness or any evil resting upon or threatening the people,these meetings furnish an excellent opportunity to bring such afflictions and troubles before the Lord.  By approaching Him in the spirit ofhumility and union, we can supplicate Him to remove these afflictions or evils from the individuals or from the people.  Our past experience hasproved to us how willing our Father in Heaven is to hear our cries in the hours of extremity and difficulty, when we approach Him in a properspirit and with proper faith.  He is quick to hear the cries of His peopleand He has promised to us that if we will draw near unto Him, He will drawnear unto us.  Such occasions as these, therefore, ought to be taken advan-tage of by the afflicted, whether in an individual or in a collective capacity.

The destiniesof all nations and peoples under heavenare in the hands of God, and when theyfight against this work they do notknow, any more than the Jews did,what they are doing. Jesus said 'Fatherforgive them ^for^ they know not what theydo.'  They did not understand thefoundation they were laying for suffering,oppression, and persecution to comeupon their heads for 1800 years afterthe death of the Messiah.  It cost them 1800 years of affliction forshedding the blood of the Lords anointed.Yet the history is before the world 
 590    LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.You were called to come here by the servants of God.  You left yourhomes to come here and you have done what was required of you in thismatter.  You have had power to finish the Temple, and you have hadpower to go in and redeem your dead.  A great many of you have donethis, and I hope all of you will continue as long as you have any dead toredeem.  Never cease that work while you have the power to enter intothe Temple.  I have greatly rejoiced at the hands of the Latter-day Saintshere.  Gold and silver are no comparison to these things.  I have hadsome thousands redeemed here.  I have had baptisms, ordinations, wash-ings and anointings, endowments and sealings for them, the same as ifthey were standing in the flesh themselves.  I shall go and meet them onthe other side of the veil.  You will go and meet your relatives.  You willhold the keys of their salvation to the endless ages of eternity, if youattend to this labor for them.There is no principle on earth that I rejoice more in than in the powerthat we hold as Latter-day Saints to build these Temples, to go into them,and to redeem our dead.  It will require immortal bodies, immortal spirits,immortal revelations to enable men to comprehend the full extent of thiswork; they cannot comprehend it in mortality.Now, I desire to live to see the Salt Lake Temple finished.  I want tobe with my brethren the Apostles, the High Priests, the Seventies, theElders and all the authorities of the Church when that Temple is dedi-cated to God.  We have been as long building that Temple as Moses wasleading the children of Israel through the wilderness to the land ofpromise, and I would like to see it finished.I view our position as Latter-day Saints, and all that is transpiring here,as well as our history before we came here, as in fulfilment of the revela-tions of God.  A great many of our friends felt had when we had to leaveour lovely Nauvoo to go into the wilderness.  It was a great trial to them.But had that not taken place, the Bible and the Book of Mormon andmany of the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants would have fallento the ground unfulfilled.  This is the place pointed out by the finger ofGod for the people to stand in holy places while the judgments of God goforth in the earth.It is marvelous in my eyes that I have lived to see the Temples thathave been built in these mountains of Israel and the mighty work thathas been performed in them, considering the condition in which we camehere.  A little handful of men, in poverty and affliction, came into thisbarren desert.  I brought President Young in my carriage into the valleyof Salt Lake.  He was sick, and he asked me to turn my carriage so hathe could get sight of the valley.  I did so.  He cast his eyes over thevalley and looked for some little time.  When he got through he said,"Brother Woodruff, drive on.  Here is our home.  This is the place Godhas pointed out for us to plant our feet.  I have seen this place before."He began to recover right from that time.  Well, we camped there, andwe visited around some.  President Young said, "Now, brethren, go whereyou please; go north, go wouth; go to any part of the country, and when

I have a great desire that, as apeople, we may be united in heart;that we may have faith in the reve-lations of God, and look to thosethings which have been promised untous.  We should be humble before the Lord.  Trace the history of JesusChrist, the Savior of the world, from the manger to the cross, onwardthrough sufferings, mingled with blood, to the throne of grace, andthere is an ensample for the Eldersof Israel, an ensample for all those who follow the Lord Jesus Christ.In meekness and lowliness of heartHe labored faithfully, while He dweltin the flesh, to carry out the will ofHis Father.  God has laid upon ourshoulders and has sealed upon ourheads the holy and eternal priest-hood, which is from eternity untoeternity.  Without that priesthoodwe have no power to administer inthe ordinances of the Gospel of Christ,either for the living or the dead.But with that priesthood we havepower to perform the work that is assigned unto us.  By that priesthoodwe have preached the Gospel, we haveadministered in the ordinances of theHouse of the Lord, and we have ga-thered together the sons and daughtersof Zion into these valleys of themountains.I feel as though I want to bear my testimony to the truth of this goodold book, the Bible, for a few minutes --the book that all the Christianworld profess to believe in.  There isan effort made to-day by the infideland unbelieving world to ridicule theBible, as not being the word of theLord.  I will refer to a few things that have been manifested in fulfill-ment of the record.  To commencewith, I will touch upon the first deal-ings of God with man.  The first son that was begotten by Father Adam,whose name was Cain, proved to be amurderer.  He slew his brother Abel,who held the priesthood and theLord pronounced a curse upon him.He showed Cain the position he wasin, and told him what the result ofhis crime would be; and Cain saidunto the Lord:"My punishment is greater than Ican bear."Behold, Thou hast driven me outthis day from the face of the earth;and from thy face shall I be hid;and I shall be a fugitive and a vaga-bond in the earth; and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth meshall slay me."But the Lord said unto him:"Therefore, whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken onhim sevenfold.  And the Lord set amark upon Cain, lest any finding himshould kill him."What was that mark?  It was amark of blackness.  That mark restedupon Cain and descended upon hisposterity from that time until thepresent.  To day there are millionsof the descendants of Cain, throughthe lineage of Ham, in the world,and that mark of darkness still restsupon them.  Though nearly six thou-sand years have passed and gone, thismark is visible to the whole humanfamily.  Yet the fool and the infidelsay there is no God, and they ridiculethe Bible.The Lamanites, on this continent,suffered a similar experience.  Theywent to war against the Nephites;they thirsted for blood, and theypainted themselves red, and the Lordput a curse of redness upon them.Hundreds of years have passed since then, but wherever you meet the La-manites to-day, you see that markupon them.-[TO BE CONTINUED.]-SOME REMARKABLE TESTIMONIES.THERE is much opposition to the claimmade by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that "it is the duty of its members to recieve revela-tion for themselves at any and at alltimes ;" and however much this factmay be doubted, those who "knowfor themselves" are not disposed to

I was justas dead as I shall be thirty years hence. I lay on my back and saw thesun go out, and passed through all the sensations of death that any manwould in drowning. After an hour's labor, I was brought around to lifeagain. I shall not go into the particulars of many of these things, but Ihave passed through what may be termed death a number of times in mylife. When I was 15 years old I was in one of those Connecticut blizzards.I walked four miles through a wood into the open country, and I sought some place where I could hide from the storm and rest. There was but one house within a mile of me—that was the poor house, which was about twenty-five rods away. The man was moved upon to go up in his garret to get some pennyroyal to give to a sick woman, and he felt led to look out of the window. He saw me crawling into the hollow of a big tree.He knew what the result of that would be better than I did. He tookhis horse and sleigh and came to me, and when he got there I was asleep, and he preserved my life. When I was 14 years old I was bit by a mad dog, and ought to have died; but I did not. So I continued on, until I can say that I have broken both of my legs, one twice; broken both of my arms, breast bone, several ribs, and altogether been through a pretty hard experience for a man who had to be called to preach the Gospel, at least. I was a miller by trade. I have been in two water wheels under full head of water, and I suppose I ought to have been killed in either ofthem, but I was not hurt.That preserving power has followed me all the way through my life. It has been with me upon my missions abroad as well as at home. It has followed me until the present day, and I have been placed in a great manystrange places.I was ordained to dedicate this Salt Lake Temple fifty years before it was dedicated. I knew I should live to dedicate that Temple. I did liveto do it. I had a great desire in my boyhood to receive the Gospel of Christ, to see a prophet or somebody that could teach me the Gospel of Christ as taught by the ancient Apostles and as I read of in the New Testament. I desired this with every sentiment of my heart, and on thefirst Gospel sermon I ever heard I was baptized, with my oldest brother.  I immediately went to Kirtland. I was in Zion's Camp with the Prophet of God. I saw the dealings of God with him. I saw the power of God with him. I saw that he was a Prophet. What was manifest to him by the power of God upon that mission was of great value to me and to allwho received his instructions. I will refer to one instance. A short time before we landed in Missouri, Joseph called the camp together. He thereprophesied unto us, and told us what lay before us. He gave us the rea-son why chastisement was before us. He said: "You consider me a boywith the rest of you. You have not realized my position before the Lord. But there is a chastisement before this camp." He told us that this would come upon us because he had not been obeyed in his counsels. In one hour after we landed in Missouri and pitched our tents at Mr. Burkett's,one man began to fall here, another there, and in a few moments we had 
 tist minister" And theminister lived near the Church, three miles from there, andwe were directed to the place.We made for the place and got to the church in time for meeting in the afternoon. A deacon met us at the door. I told him to tell the min-ister there were two servants of God at the door who had a message to deliver to the people of that island.The minister kindly invited us up to the pulpit, which invitation we accepted, going up valise in hand.We were entire strangers and of course in that position, were the ob-jects of interest to the congregation.  The minister asked us what we wanted. We told him we wanted to preach to the people. When?This evening. After naming thehour and giving out the notice, he invited us to take tea with him athis home. When we got into thehouse, I took out the Bible, Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Cove-nants laying them one on the other upon the table, but said nothing. By and by he took them up and lookedthem over in silence. After pausingsometime I asked him if there wasa schoolhouse in the island. Heanswered that there were five. "Arethey free to preach in?" "Yes." Ithought that was allright, and said nomore. He asked no questions.When the time arrived we went to meeting. I told the people the na-ture of our mission, and recited to them the history of the organization of the Church of God upon the earth; and then preached on the first principles of the gospel. When I got through Brother Hale boretestimony. We then gave out no-tices that we would hold meet-ings at certain hours in the various school houses, which ap-pointments we filled. All this timethe minister was engaged readingthe Book of Mormon and the Doc-trine and Covenants, and for days he walked his room till midnight,not knowing what to do, whether to accept our doctrines and thereby renounce his faith and lose his po-sition, or to reject it. After consid-ering the matter for ten days, dur-ing which time he was supplyingour daily wants, he concluded to re-ject our message, and from that timehe commenced to oppose us. But no sooner had he closed his doorupon us that a sea captain invited us to his home. We went with him and succeded in baptizing him and his brother, and also commencedbaptizing others. The minister see-ing this and becoming alarmed, went to the south island to get a Mr. Douglas, a Methodist minister, to come and help him to oppose the Mormons. They combined together and held a kind of convention. I was present and heard this Mr.Douglas tell a great many false-hoods and also misquote Scripture.When they got through I chargedthem with telling falsehoods andmisquoting Scripture, and announc-ed that on Monday evening we would meet the people and ministersby way of answering to what had been said that night.  The conse-quence was that I preached to this Baptist congregation and baptizedevery member that owned onedollar in the meeting house and we followed the Methodist minister to his home in the south island and succeeded in baptizing most of his congregation. These are little inci-dents in my early experience.I have watched with a great deal of interest the results of the labors of Bro. Morgan in the South-ern States, I myself having traveled over some of the same ground and been the means of bringing in the Church many people from that land, some of whom are alive and living in Utah to-day. Here arethese Thomas' that are here—Bro.Daniel Thomas is dead and I preach-ed his funeral sermon. I baptizedhis father and mother, he was anold revolutionary soldier, who fought under Washington, and wasbetween 80 and 90 years of age.When I laid my hands upon hishead to confirm him a member ofthe Church, I told him that he would be gathered home with the Saints and be buried with them.This his son told me afterwards was the only thing that ever tried hisfaith, for he did not know the way the old gentleman would be gather-ed. The consequence was that Brother Thomas was with the first company who were gathered out of the southern country. When he got to Far West Father Thomas wroteto his son Daniel to come and take him to Far West, he went after himand carried him up to Far West; and three days after his arrival he diedthere and was buried. We say a great many things sometimes inconfirming people when under the influence of the Spirit of God, that appear to the natural mind almost impossibilities, and which we do notunderstand ourselves, only as the Lord confirms them.These, my brethren and sisters, are incidents of my experience whileon my first mission.  Joseph Smith, Brigham Young and the TwelveApostles have met with similarthings, for this is way we had to travel in the early days. We al-ways went without purse or scrip, leaving our families many times in the depths of poverty. We left our wives in poverty to go to England, after ful-filling the revelation given on the 26th day of April, at Far West,where, in obedience to the command of the Lord, we laid the chief corner stone of the temple. This was the only revelation in which God had given day and date requiring the Saints to fulfil a certain thing by a certain time.  When that revelation was given, the bitter enemies of this Church connived together and swore by all the gods that if all the other revelations of Joe Smith'shad been fulfilled, that oneshould not be, because there wasday and date to it, and they wouldsee that it should not be fulfilled.You know the history of that, howthat the Lord overruled so that ev-erything was brought to pass to the very letter.We went to England and laboredenergetically, the Lord crowningour labors with great success. Webaptized 7,000 people. I myself brought into the Church near 2,000,most of whom were brought into the Church in about eight months' laborin the Herefordshire mission. Afterspending one year in England with the Twelve, and establishing the Church there, we returned home in peace and safety.Now, I want to say to my breth-ren and sisters, this is Mormonism;this is the way we have lived. You are in another condition; you have lived 40 years since that day—from1840 to 1880. You are located in the Rocky Mountains, and you are fillingthese mountains with Latter-daySaints. You have go the kingdom of God, and the Lord is with you,and is very anxious that thispeople should build up this kingdom.In listening to Brother Pratt to-daypreach to us, and when I read the revelations, and when I reflect uponthat grand and glorious vision which God gave to Joseph, which marks out the destiny of all men; andwhen I consider that you and I have the power while here in the flesh to attain to the high and exalted posi-tion in the celestial kingdom of God,which is described in this Book of Covenants, I feel that our aims should be high, and that our privi-leges here on the earth are all that we should ask for. What are gold and silver, what are the monopoliesof wealth which Brother Morgan has spoken of as existing in the east.What, I say, are immense riches in the hands of a few men comparedto the blessings of eternal life? Why,bless your souls, the men who wieldthis wordly power are, as a generalthing, men that will go down to hellwhen they shall pass away; in fact, they are in the same situation asthe man referred to by the Saviorwho wanted to build larger barnsand storehouses, and of whom the Son of Man said, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required ofthee. As I remarked to the ReliefSociety of Provo a week ago, so say I now, if I could live 1,000 years here in the flesh, and had to labor in pov-erty and hunger all the days of my life, and if by my acts and course of labor I could secure unto myself theprivilege of having my wivesand children with me in the morning of the first resurrection and could have them with me in my family organization in the celestialworld, to dwell with me in that stateand glory, I should feel amply repaid;it would more than reward me for any trials and inconveniences and troubles that I may have to endurehere. As Brother Morgan has said to you so say I to this people to-night, the world know not the na-ture of the treasure we have, they never did nor can know while they reject the truth as it is offered to them. But while it is a painful thing to see men reject and oppose the gospel, and stand ready to per-secute those who have been willing to sacrifice their all in order to pro-claim it to a fallen world, I say, while this is painful enough to a con-siderate Latter-day Saint, it is notnear so bad as when men apostatizeand deny the truth; of all things un-der heaven I dislike to see, it is to seemen who have once known the truth and seen the light, turn roundand deny that which they have known and seen. I can bury Latter-day Saints, I can see my brethrenand sisters laid in the silent tombwho have received of the ordinances of the House of God, and who have been true and faithful unto death,without feeling to mourn; but after traveling with men, as I have done,for years and years, and heard thembear record that they knew that this was indeed and of a truth the Church and Kingdom of God, andafter being valiant for the cause for40 years, then turn and deny all,deny God and every principle of lifeand salvation, in this there is some-thing truly sorrowful.Brethern and sisters, let us liveour religion and keep the faith and labor to overcome the world. WhatBrother Morgan has said respecting the condition of our nation is trueas God is true. This nation nor the world know not what awaits themneither do the Latter-day Saints un-less they possess that spirit whichpartakes of the things of God and reveals them unto man. There aregreat changes at your door; there are great changes awaiting Zion;there great changes awaiting our own nation, and there are great changes to come upon Babylon.And the elements financial, socialand political, which have been re-ferred to this evening, will be usedby the Lord to overthrow this power-ful nation, and I know it, and beartestimony of it; although men gen-erally know not, and seemingly carenot to know, but I know the handof God is in these things, and he willrule and overrule in these materialmatters, and although not interfer-ing with men's agency, he will so order things that men will on natur-al principles bring about their owndestruction and they alone will be to blame for it because their cup willbe full. God says in a modern re-velation that he is angry with nonesave those who refuse to acknow-ledge him in all things. The world of mankind does not acknowledge thehand of God in anything. The sinsof this generation are ascending up,like smoke out of a pit, before high heavens, and the anger of the Lordis kindled against the wicked and ungodly, and his angels stand ready to receive the command to go forthand reap down the earth. This time must come sooner or later; the days of the reign and rule of sin and wickedness are numbered, and thedestruction of the wicked will come upon them like a thief in the night and when they shall be marrying and giving in marriage and engaged in all kinds of revelry.The wicked do not seem to knowthat it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a jealous God.  There are a thousand cases of murder to-day where there was but one when this Book of Mormon was translated and sent forth to the world, and a thousand cases of whoredoms and adultery where there was one then.In those days both law and virtuewere respected and honored; but af-ter this word had gone forth to the people and had been treated with in-difference and rejected by them, the Lord commenced to withdraw hisSpirit from them, until to-day itfinds little, if any, place in theirhearts, and as a consequence, Satanhas control over them and they arefast ripening in iniquity, and the whole earth is ready for judgment;and there will be none to deliver.Since my return from the south,the question has been asked me a number of times if I had received a revelation while in the south. Itdoes seem strange to me that such aquestion should be asked. We have twelve Apostles and their counsel-ors, who are upheld by the Latter-day Saints in general conference as-sembled, as prophets, seers and reve-lators; and is it a strange thing that they should receive a revela-tion? There are, say 5,000 Seventies in these mountains whohold the Melchisedek priesthood, as well as many thousands of HighPriests and many thousands of El-ders who also hold a portion of theMelchisedek priesthood, and is it a marvel or a wonder that God shouldgive a revelation to anybody? Whatan idea! The marvel to me is that prophets and apostles should live atall without revelation.If we build up the Kingdom ofGod we shall see the necessity of re-ceiving constant aid from our Fatherand God to direct us in carrying outto fulfilment his great and gloriouspurposes.The judgments of God await theworld and the nations that live to-day, when the inhabitants shall be-come fully ripe in wickedness. Asthe Lord lives all the revelationsof God concerning them will surely come to pass. Therefore prepareyourselves, ye Saints of the latter-

Men came from California,among them Brannan, who urged us strongly to go to California, sayingthat it was such a fine country, and we were there in a barren desert.But President Young said, "This is our home.  Here we shall build theTemple of God and the city of our God."  I think this has been plainlyfulfilled.  The inspiration of the Lord was with President Young allthrough his life, and the result of it is manifest.  I traveled with him inthe first settling of this country.Where is there a man that has the spirit of inspiration but can see thehand of God in these things?  We have had our day of affliction, of per-secution and poverty.  All earth and hell, if I may be allowed to use suchan expression, were combined against the Prophet Joseph Smith, from thetime this Church was organized until he was slain in the flesh, and thesame spirit continued through the life of Brother Brigham Young.  Butwe came to these valleys of the mountains, and from the day that weplanted our tents in Salt Lake City there has been a degree ofo prosperityresting upon this people, and it has increased year by year until to day.The Lord has been with us.  Blessings have been poured out upon theLatter-day Saints, and we have had plenty of food and raiment.  But Ihope that none of us will get proud and lifted up in our hearts so that weshall forget the hand that has given unto us these things.[TO BE CONTINUED.]

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENIAL STAR. 387a dozen of our camp stretched upon blankets with the cholera. TheProphet of God, when he saw this, felt to sympathize with them, and heand Hyrum laid their hands upon Brother Carter, the first man that was taken sick, but as soon as they did it they were seized themselves, and they both had to leave the camp. He said afterwards: "I told you what was coming to pass, and when affliction came I stretched out my hand to stay it, and I came very near falling by it myself." That mission was very interesting to me.I want to say here that in all my life since joining this Church and kingdom, notwithstanding these powers that have been with me to kill me, I have always had the revelations of God with me. That is somethingI want to talk about to Israel before I get through. The power of God has told me what to do and what not to do. While the devil has hadpower to afflict my body very seriously, there has been a power with me that has saved me through it all. And, whenever I have had the Holy Spirit with me to tell me what to do, I have had to do that. By that I have been saved. By listening to that still small voice I am here to-day with you. There are two reasons why I am here to-day. When I wentback after the pioneer journey, President Young said he wanted me totake my family and go to Boston, and stay there till I could gather allthe Saints of God in New England and Canada and bring them to Zion.  That was the mission he gave me on my return from the pioneer journey to Winter Quarters. I went in the spring, as he told me, and took my family. We came one evening to one of the brethren's houses in Indiana.  Several of us were there. Orson Hyde had a team as well as myself. Wedrove into a long yard. I set my carriage within six inches of his. I had my wife and children with me. I tied my animals to an oak tree on the other side of where we camped. I went to bed in my carriage. As I laid down, the Spirit of the Lord told me to get up and move my carriage. I did not ask the Lord what He meant. I did as I was told. The same Spirit told me to go and move my animals away from that tree. I did that. My wife asked me why I did it. I told her I did not know. I had not been in bed twenty minutes when there came a whirlwind and took that oak tree, which had stood there perhaps fifty years, split it right through the trunk, and it swept through both of those fences where my carriage had stood. It never touched Brother Hyde's carriage, but it would have crushed me and my family to the earth if I had not listened to the voice of the Spirit. After spending two years and a half in NewEngland and Canada, getting the Saints out, I started back with the last lot, about a hundred, from Boston. We landed in Pittsburg at dusk. We were anxious not to stay there, but to go on to St. Louis. I saw a steamermaking steam ready to go out. I went to the captain and asked him how many passengers he had. "Three hundred and fifty." "Could you takeanother hundred?" "Yes." I was just about to tell him we wanted to go aboard when that Spirit said to me, "Don't go aboard that steamer, you nor your company." All right, said I. I had learned something about that still small voice. I did not go aboard that steamer, but waited till the next morning. In thirty minutes after that steamer left, it took fire. It had

If I had not obeyed the influence of that monitor within me, I would have been there myself, with the restof the company. The Thirteenth ward would not have had an Atwoodfor a Bishop; the Church would not have had a Leonard W. Hardy asBishop. They were both with me, and their families, including Brother Samuel Hardy, who is in St. George now, upwards of ninety years old.I never disobeyed that Spirit but once in my life; I did it then through the agency of other persons, and it nearly cost me my life. I have beenacquainted with this Spirit. It was not the blow of trumpets nor thunderand lightning; it was the still small voice to me. All the way from my boyhood I have been governed and controlled by that Spirit. My mis-sions have been by that Spirit of revelation. I was told to go to FoxIslands by that same still small voice.  In the time of the great apostasyin Kirtland the Spirit of the Lord said to me, "Get you a partner and go to Fox Islands." I knew no more what was in Fox Islands than what was in Kolob. I went there, however, baptized a hundred and brought themup to Zion with me. It was upon that island where I received a letterfrom Joseph Smith, telling me that I was called by revelation to fill the place of one of the Twelve who had fallen. You will see it in the Doctrineand Covenants. That thing was revealed to me before I received the letter from Joseph Smith, but I did not feel disposed to tell it to any mortal man, for I knew it was my duty to keep such things to myself.Through all my life and labors, whenever I have been told to do anything by the Spirit of the Lord, I have always found it good to do it. I have been preserved by that power. That power was with me when I went to Herefordshire. I was preaching every night with Brother Cordon,and one night we held a meeting in the town hall at Hanley, in Stafford-shire. The Spirit—that still small voice—said to me, "This is the lastmeeting you will hold with this people for many days." I told the con-gregation so when I got up. They were very much astonished, and asked me where I was going. I told them I did not know. After, I went to ask the Lord what he wanted of me, and He told me to go the south.That was all the answer I got. I took the stage and rode eighty miles south. The first man's house I went into was John Benbow's. I had not been in his house fifteen minutes till I understood why the Lord had sent me there. There was a people broken off from the Wesleyan Methodists,who had banded together and called themselves United Brethren. They were watching for the coming of the Son of Man, watching for the Gospelof Christ, as they read of it in the New Testament. The first thirty days after I got there I brought into the Church some two thousands, with fifty ministers, and all their chapels, licensed according to law, were in my hands. There was no blowing of trumpets about that. The Spirit of the Lord told me to go there, and when I got there I saw why I was sent.That is, perhaps, enough to say about those things. Now, I want to say to this congregation, to the young men of Israel, to the Elders of Israel,to all our missionaries, the day has come when the God of heaven requiresat my hands, as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day

 days, for that which awaits you;for judgments will begin at the House of God, and from there it will go forth to this and other nations asit has never before been known, un-til the whole earth shall be cleansedfrom wickedness and the way madestraight for the coming of our Lord.I would repeat the counsel that has been sounded in the ears of this people for these many years. Letus live our religion and have the fear of God in our hearts. Some ofus are not going to remain herevery much longer; we will passaway, but we have boys and girlsgrowing up who will carry on the great work of salvation and redemp-tion which God is establishing inthe earth. I have strong feelings for the welfare of our boys and girls.I look at the evils around them,which beset their pathway in life,which are the means used by the devil to overthrow them; and heseeks the overthrow of this wholepeople; and he will overthrow every-body that can be overthrown. There-fore, I would say, teach your boys and girls the principles of the gospel;teach them to pray unto God, to call upon him that his spirit may restupon them and touch their hearts, that they may be led in the pathsof righteousness, and thus be savedfrom the evils of the world. I ampleased to see so many of our youngpersons interest themselves in the principles revealed from heaven forour guidance and salvation, andhope and pray that they will con-tinue in well doing, for upon theirshoulders, as I have often said,must sooner or later devolve the re-sponsibility of carrying on this work.I believe there are a great many ofour sons and daughters in thesemountains who will not taste of death, whose bodies will not lie in the grave, and they will live in the flesh until Christ shall come, to be caught up to meet him in the air.We have got to exercise faith in God and call upon him, and drawnear unto him and thus prepare our-selves for the things which await us in life.I feel as though I have saidenough.I pray God to bless you, and to bless the holy priesthood, the Apos-tles, the Seventies, the High Priests, and all who bear the priesthood in this generation. Let us maintainour integrity to God and live so as to be at last worthy of the high and exalted position that we are aimingfor in the heavens, for to lose thisthrough falling away, it would havebeen better for us had we never beenborn, and far better to have beentaken away in our youth. It is a warfare all the time for man, womanand child; and that we may fight the battle of life, and overcome the world, the flesh and the devil, andbe prepared for eternal life, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus.Amen.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR. 389Saints, to say unto you, it is the will of God for you to take this course.Get the Spirit of God before you go on your missions or anywhere else. Get the Spirit of revelation with you. And when you get that you are safe, and you will do exactly what the Lord wants you to do. I have feltstrongly impressed to say that to this Conference. What can you do without revelation? We cannot do the will of God and accomplish what is required of us without it. We will make no mistakes if we pursue that course. That spirit is with the Apostles, and with the Elders of Israelwho are true and faithful. The rising generation should labor to obtainthe Spirit of God. Get it within you and it will be a continual monitorwithin you.That is one reason, brethren and sisters, why my life has been preserved.I will tell you another reason. Of course, this is my own reason for it.One reason why I am here is because the Lord has chosen the weak thingsof this world to preach the Gospel, to do His work, to build up His king-dom. I do not think He has ever had a weaker instrument on earth to work through than myself. The Almighty has known that never for a minute since I have been a member of this Church have I had any powerto take any honor or glory to myself with regard to anything that I have been enabled to do in the work of the ministry or elsewhere. Why?Because I have known it has come from God, and not from me. And no other man who has engaged in this work has had any power of himself.This power has come from God unto us, whereby we have been enabled to do the work He has required at our hands.There is a change coming over the earth; there is a change coming over the Christian world; and it is at our door. You read the revelations in the Bible, in the Book of Mormon and in the Doctrine and Covenantsappertaining to our day and the generation before the coming of the Son of Man. War! Yes; war is one of the troubles that belong to the genera-tion in which we live. It will come to pass, and no power beneath the heavens can stay it. Who cannot open their eyes and see the change in the things around us? Read these revelations—the revelation just read by Brother Cannon, and the others in these books. The God of heavenhas set His hand to carry out these great purposes that you read of.They are as sure to come to pass as that God lives. There is no power on earth, nor beneath the earth, nor anywhere else, that can stay the fulfill-ment of these things. And they are at our doors.I am anxious that the Latter-day Saints shall round up their shouldersand bear off the kingdom of God. Many in the world have labored to try to overthrow Mormonism. They have driven our people from their lands. They have persecuted and afflicted us. They have put some to death, for the word of God and testimony of Jesus. But they have notthwarted the purposes of God in any of these things. The Lord, in Hismercy and wisdom, has led this people to these valleys of the mountains.It is ordained of God that Zion is to be established here. Here is the Tabernacle that the Prophet spoke of as a covering from the storm and the wind, etc. These temples are here in fulfillment of prophecy. Wehave four of them in this State.

 instead of so many theories whichare contrary to the word of Godand lead to infidelity in time.Now there is another thoughtto express and ^that^ is this. Thatas the subject of building thetemple is sometimes agitatedand it is generally supposedthat those who have the moneywill build it and some greatperson of architict will designand direct it, and so forth. Nowthere are reasons why this is not true.First, as Nephi of old also thebro. of Jared both did exceedingfine workmanship after havingtalked with the Lord and received their direction, ^so^ He  is is justas able to so direct us as hHedid them.

He lived long enough to dedicate the corner stone of this Temple on this block, into which the Latter-day Saints go and deliver their friends who are in the prison house, and attend to the ordinances of the house of God for them, in fulfillment of the ancient Prophets, who spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost, to the effect that saviors should be raised up on Mount Zion in the latter days while the kingdom is the Lord's. Zion has got to arise."Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing,O mountains; for the Lord hath comforted His people, and will havemercy upon His afflicted."But Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath for-gotten me."Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have com-passion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I notforget thee."Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me." (Isaiah 49:13-16.)All that has been spoken concerning Zion will come to pass, and you and I to-day are witnesses of these things.We are here for salvation and eternal life. We are here to obtain those great blessings which Saints of God in every age of the world have obtained when they have obeyed the commandments of God. Shall wefail? No, we shall not if we do our duty. The Gospel is just as good to-day as it was in the days of the Savior. As to the glorious blessings of the Gospel of Christ, they have been unpopular in almost every age of the world. Take Christ Himself: where was there a more unpopular man than the Savior of the world in His day? And His Apostles were un-popular. They were put to death for the word of God and testimony of Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, Christ was the Son of God; and the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, and all the sects that warred against Him werecursed and many of them were cast down to hell, while He remains as the Savior of the world, and received the honor and the glory which HisFather had ordained for Him. I want our young people especially toremember these things. Those who are going upon missions must not neglect them. Unless you have the Holy Ghost with you when you go out to preach the Gospel, you cannot do your duty; but when you have that you are safe, go where you will, and your words will have their effect in the hearts of the honest and meek of the earth.Brethren and sisters, I feel to thank God that we are as well off as weare. I feel to thank God that we are in the position we occupy in these valleys of the mountains. Here is a safe place. While in the dedication of that Temple I saw the judgments of God that were about to be pouredout upon this generation. They will come to pass. I read the other night of a terrible flood. Who ever heard of such a flood in America before?These floods, and troubles and tribulations are increasing in the earth, andthey will increase until this scene is wound up. I pray God my heavenly Father to bless you all, to inspire our hearts, that the vision of our minds may be open to comprehend the position we are in and the responsibility 
 will with loving ^hands^ assist in thebuilding of the temple and ifthey have to spend every momentin the support of their families in-stead of witnessing with the resttheir love for his work it willbe such a disappointment aswill spoil the unity of spiritand love toward one another.Thus, when the saints are gath-ered to Zion the Lord will pro-vide for the temple, both material and workman.I have a case of libel here againstsome of the officers which whencarried through the differentcourts will provide somemeans for the redemptionof Zion and every cent willbe used for the purpose butit will probably be one year

 D H CannonSt George Septr 29th 1877Elder Wilford Woodruff;Dear Brother—I have receivedtwo short notes from you, the news contained therein was cheering, asanything, which contains that whichis favorable to the intrests of Zionis of intrest to me, these labors of which you speak, as having ^fallen^ on to the Shoulders of the Twelve, addedto the labors that were alreadyresting upon their Shoulders, andthey have a burthen, which Godalone can give them the necessarystrength to perform. The Deathof our beloved President has casta gloom over the entire communityyet, there is a degree of resignation that one could scarcely have antici-piated; which clearly indicates that 
 In the first place, I will say that the Prophet Joseph taught us that Father Adam was the first man on the earth to whom God gave thekeys of the Everlasting Priesthood.He held the keys of the Presidency, and was the first man who did holdthem. Noah stood next to him. These keys were given to Noah, hebeing the father of all living in his day, as Adam was in his day. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:40-52##]These two men were the first whoreceived the Priesthood in the eter-nal worlds, before the worlds wereformed. They were the first who received the Everlasting Priesthood or Presidency on the earth. Father Adam stands at the head, so far asthis world is concerned. Of course, Jesus Christ is the Great High Priest of the salvation of the humanfamily. But Adam holds those keysin the world today; he will holdthem to the endless ages of eternity.And Noah, and every man who hasever held or will hold the keys of Presidency of the Kingdom of God,from that day until the scene is wound up, will have to stand beforeFather Adam and give an account of the keys of that Priesthood, as we all will have to give an account unto the Lord, of the principles thatwe have received, when our work is done in the flesh.Brother Cannon has given my mind with regard to Joseph Smith.I look upon Joseph Smith as the greatest Prophet that ever breathed the breath of life, excepting Jesus Christ. Father Adam, as I have said, stands at the head; but Joseph Smith was reserved to lay the foun-dation of this great Kingdom and dispensation of salvation to thewhole human family in these lastdays, to build up Zion, to establishGod's Kingdom, and to prepare itfor the coming of the Son of Man.He held those keys. Brother Can-non has told you the truth. No other man held those keys while he lived.After him, as has been said, came Brother Brigham. I have traveledwith Joseph Smith thousands ofmiles. There are some here tonight who were in Zion's Camp. He wasa boy, in one sense of the word. He was but a young man when hewas martyred and passed into the presence of God. His days were comparatively few. But he was a great man. He lived a long life fora few days. He performed an al-mighty work—as great a work as any man, save Jesus Christ, thatever lived on the earth. We knew him. We knew the Apostles. We knew Brother Brigham; he was a glazier and painter, and, in onesense of the word, an illiterate man. But God raised him up to do a great work and to follow in the channel of Joseph Smith. He magnified hiscalling. He led this people to thesemountains, and he built up this country almost from one end of it to the other, by his counsel. TheLord took him to Himself. BrotherTaylor followed, until he was taken away.Now, all of these men were whatthe world would call weak instru-ments in the hands of God.  I have been asked the question many times, "Why did the Lord choose JosephSmith to bring forth the Book of Mormon and to lay the foundation of this great Kingdom here on theearth? Why didn't He choose Dr. Haws, Dr. Porter, Mr. Beecher, or some great man?" I have neverhad but one answer in my life to all such men, and that is, "The Lordcould not do anything with them,because of their unbelief, and theirunwillingness to acknowledge His hand in all things." That is the reason the Lord has chosen weak instruments to do His work. And I will say here, if any of you want a weaker instrument than Wilford Woodruff to hold the keys of the Kingdom of God, you ought to beashamed of yourselves. The Lord,however, is just as able to inspireme, or Brother Cannon, or any other man, when the time comes, asHe has inspired other men in past ages. I know what the will of Godis concerning this people, and ifthey will take the counsel we givethem, all will be well with them.Now, I want to make a few re-marks concerning myself. I neverlike to do this; but I want to give you a little of my experience in afew things, and I want to tell youwhere my strength lies, and thegreatest evidence that any Elder of Israel can have, ever did have, orever will have on the face of the earth with regard to the work of God.Speaking of the administration of angels. I never asked the Lord in my life to send me an angel or toshow me any miracle. I wantedthe Gospel of Christ; and the first sermon I ever heard preached in this Church I had a testimony formyself that it was the Gospel ofChrist. I had a testimony to satisfymyself when I was baptized. I had been looking, praying, hungeringand thirsting to find some man onthe face of the earth who had thePriesthood, and who could teach methe Gospel. When I heard this ser-mon, I knew the voice; I knew the shepherd; I knew it was true. And from that day until this, I have never seen one moment in my life that I have ever had doubts withregard to it. I have never had anytrial in this Church with regard to my faith. My trials have been of another nature. I have had the administration of angels in my dayand time, though I never prayed for an angel. I have had, in severalinstances, the administration of holy messengers. In 1835, at Broth-er A. O. Smoot's mother's house in Kentucky, I received a letter one day from Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, requesting me to stay in Kentucky and Tennessee and take charge of the Church there. He wanted David Patten and Warren Parrish to go to Kirt-land to receive their endowments.Joseph said in that letter: "You shall lose no blessing by pursuing this course." That letter was a great joy, a great comfort and consolationto me. I had traveled with JosephSmith to Missouri. I had beenacquainted with him, and I knew he was a Prophet of God. In theevening of that day I went into a little back room, in which was a small settee. I was alone. I was overwhe[lm]ed with joy and consola-tion at the letter I had received andthe encouraging words it contained. I knelt down and prayed. I arosefrom my knees and sat down. The room was filled with light. A mes-senger came to me. We had a long conversation. He laid before me as if in a panorama, the signs of the last days, and told me what was coming to pass. I saw the sunturned to darkness, the moon to blood, the stars fall from heaven. I saw the resurrection day. I sawarmies of men in the first resurrec-tion, clothed with the robes of theHoly Priesthood. I saw the second resurrection. I saw a great many signs that were presented before me. by this personage; and among the rest, there were seven lions, as of burning brass, set in the heavens. He says, "That is one of the signs that will appear in the heavens be-fore the coming of the Son of Man. It is a sign of the various dispensa-tions."Now, had I been an artist, on thenext day I could have sat down at my table and drawn, as clearly asthough I had studied them all my life, everything I saw. I went tomeeting the next day, with Brother Smoot. I hardly knew where I was. I did not comprehend a being,scarcely. I was entirely over-whelmed with what I had seen thenight before. 
 44and converse with them, but between ^him and^ those forwhom he had not officiated there was abarrier, he could have no intercourse withthem. Of course this is a dream, butthere are many truths sometimes indreams, and if this dream is not exactlyfulfilled,yet there is ^yet^ an important principleconnected with it. Although the testimonydead many hear the testimony of JosephSmith and the Apostles and those thatare in the spiritworld—although theymay receive their testimony, yet theycannot receive the blessings of the gospeluntil they are relieved from prison, theycannot receive their wives, nor wivestheir husbands, and associate with them,and be prepared to have a part in

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR. 391we are under. The eyes of all heaven and earth and hell are over us.The eyes of the devils are over us. They labor for our destruction; but they have not the power to do it. We are in the hands of God. He holdsthe keys of the destinies of the inhabitants of the earth, and He will bless the righteous, no matter who they are nor where they are. I am thankfulto listen to the teachings that I have heard at this Conference from the Elders of Israel. I rejoice in the progress that has been made during the past year in the Church abroad. There has been an addition to the Church that we have never met with in any other year since the organization of this Church. And here at home there has been a great addition. Our sisters have labored faithfully in the Primary Associations, in the Mutual Improvement Associations, and in every capacity in which they are called to labor. The blessings of God are with them, and they are doing much good.The Sunday schools have also added to their numbers. They have now over one hundred thousand members. The Young Men's Mutual Improve-ment Associations, as has been said, have an addition of about thirteenthousand as a result of their labors the past year. God is blessing those who labor among them. If you can save a soul from death, what blessingsyou will have with that soul. As the Lord said to Oliver Cowdery, "Ifit so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto thispeople, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father." We should continue in this labor, that we may gain the salvation of the souls of men. Inasmuch asyou will do this, the blessings of God will attend you.  Zion has got to arise or fall. Which shall it be? The proclamation of the Gospel of Christ is in favor of Zion. All the revelations appertaining to this day are in favor of Zion, and of preparing the way for the coming of the Son of Man. And Zion will arise and shine.God bless you, one and all. Let us do our duty and seek to magnifyour religion, that when we get through we will rejoice in that. It is better to be on the Lord's side than anywhere else. I want salvation. I want to meet my forefathers and my friends whom I have labored here to redeem, who never heard the Gospel in their day and generation. Godhas given us this privilege. We have Elders of Israel laboring in all these temples day by day for the salvation of the children of men. We have been blessed in this labor, and we will continue to be blessed; and whenwe get on the other side of the veil there is not one of us but will rejoicefor the good we have done. May God bless you. I feel to bless the Latter-day Saints, as far as I have power to bless. Our daughters andour mothers are laboring for the salvation of Israel in their line, and so are the Elders of Israel in their line. But we want to increase and con-tinue to increase, until we have power in the earth to gather up all thehonest and meek of the earth. God bless, guide and direct us all in the path of truth and righteousness, for Jesus' sake. Amen.WE must be as courteous to a man as we are to a picture, which we are willing to give the advantage of a good light. 
 Some of you have read the history of the power of the devil in Eng-land, when the fallen angels that are upon the earth made war uponBrother Kimball, Brother Hyde, Brother Fielding and Brother Rus-sell, who had all they could do to live in the midst of that kind of warfare. These evil spirits knockeddown Brother Russell and BrotherHyde. They didn't Brother Kim-ball; but that power fell upon him. His eyes were opened. He saw the spirits before him; he saw whatkind of beings they were. Theygnashed their teeth; they were mad; they wanted to destroy the lives ofthe brethren. These men held thePriesthood. Brother Kimball heldthe keys of the Priesthood, so far as England was concerned. These spirits had not, therefore, the powerto destroy them.Brother Kimball, Brother George A. Smith and myself had a similarexperience in London, at a house where we were stopping. It seemedas if there were legions of spiritsthere. They sought our destruction;and on one occasion, after Brother Kimball had left, these powers ofdarkness fell upon us to destroy ourlives, and both Brother Smith andmyself would have been killed, ap-parently, had not three holy mes-sengers come into the room andfilled the room with light. Theywere dressed in temple clothing. They laid their hands upon ourheads and we were delivered, and that power was broken, so far as we were concerned. Why did the Lord send these men to us? Because we could not have livedwithout it; and, as a general thing,angels do not administer to anybody on the earth unless it is to preserve the lives of good men, or to bring the Gospel, or perform a work thatmen cannot do for themselves. Thatis the reason Moroni and otherangels of God visited and taught Joseph Smith. They quoted to him whole chapters in the Bible—in Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel—andtold him what must come to pass inthe last days. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:30-47##] It was necessary forthese angels to give him the Priest-hood. There was no mystery at all with regard to what was taughthim. He knew it was of God. These very principles sustained Jo-seph Smith from the hour the Gospel was delivered to him until he sealed his testimony with his blood.Now, I have had all these testi-monies, and they are true. But with all these, I have never hadany testimony since I have been in the flesh, that has been greater than the testimony of the Holy Ghost. That is the strongest testi-mony that can be given to me or toany man in the flesh. Now, every man has a right to that, and when he obtains it, it is a living witness to him. It deceives no man, andnever has. Lucifer may appear to man in the capacity of an angel of light; but there is no deception withthe Holy Ghost. We do not par-ticularly need the administration of angels unless we are in a condition similar to that in which Brother Kimball, Brother Smith and my-self were placed, when we could notsave our lives without them.I say to you, as Brother Cannon has, the Kingdom of God is here. The Priesthood is here. The keys of the Kingdom of God arehere. They will remain here. It makes no difference whether Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, or anybody else, remain; while these keys are here we have a right to know the mind and will of God; andwhen we do our duty, when we live our religion, we shall have these principles manifested to us. I know what awaits this nation. I know what awaits the Latter-day Saints.Many things have been shown to meby vision and by revelation. I know that the Latter-day Saints have needto repent of all their darkness, alltheir unbelief and all their disunionthat they have in Zion. Our power, our salvation, our exaltation, our re-demption, our glory and our prepa-ration for the coming of the Son ofMan, depend entirely upon our own acts. As was said today, if we are not united, we shall be chastised bythe power of God. But the Lord said: "Fear not, little flock, thekingdom is yours until I come." [##Doctrine and Covenants 35:27##]No matter if earth and hell com-bine against us, we are in His hands, and He has said that He will guide and direct the affairs of theKingdom. The Lord is no differenttoday from what He was in the days of Adam, of Enoch, of Christ, of Joseph, of Brigham. The Latter-day Saints should seek for the Spirit of God. We have great power andgreat blessings given unto us. Ashas been said here, look at our condition today, and compare it with what it has been in years past. Some of you were ac-quainted with our former condition. Here is Brother Philo Dibble. Hewas in Jackson County. He was shot through the body; but his life was preserved by the power of God. We were driven away; our property was burned and destroyed. TheLord told us to importune at the feet of the Judge and the Governor,and if they did not heed us, to im-portune at the feet of the President. And if the President would not heed us, then the Lord would comeforth out of His hiding place, "and in His fury vex the nation, and inHis hot displeasure and in His fierce anger, in His time, will cut off thosewicked, unfaithful and unjuststewards, and appoint them theirportion among hypocrites and unbe-lievers, even in outer darkness, where there is weeping, and wail-ing, and gnashing of teeth." [##Doctrine and Covenants 101:86-91##] Do you think the Lord told the truth?Yes, He did; and not one jot or tittle will fall unfulfilled. If our nation does not give us our rights; if they continue to oppressand persecute us, these things are in the hands of God. More than 50years ago the Prophet Joseph re-ceived a revelation which said: "Behold, verily I say unto you, the angels are crying unto the Lord day and night, whoare ready and waiting to be sentforth to reap down the field." [##Doctrine and Covenants 86:5##] Theseangels wanted to go and reap downthe earth. But the Lord said in effect, "No; wait till the earth iswarned; wait till the nations of theearth have the Gospel of Christpreached unto them; wait till theyhave a chance to repent and receivethe Gospel, if they will. When thisis done, then you may go down."Brethren, the heavens are full ofjudgment. And as the Lord toldthe people at the commencement of this work, "If the nation will re-pent, if they will obey my law andkeep my commandments, I, theLord, will save these judgments; otherwise they shall be poured out,as I, the Lord, have spoken." Thesethings are true. The judgments of God will increase from this hour,until the land is deluged in blood. War will overtake our nation. Thecivil war, the war between theNorth and the South, which laid in the dust nearly a million of men and cost the nation many hundredmillions of dollars, was only the be-ginning of suffering. Had this na-tion listened to the counsels of Jo-seph Smith and heeded them, this war and the terrible suffering which it entailed would have been avoided. But the judgments of the Lord are not yet ended. He is going to fulfill His work.Now, my object, and your object,is—at least it should be—to try to doour duty.

 ders of Israel; I have got to meetFather Adam, in the Kingdom of God in the heavens; and we have all got to give an account to him, as ourGreat Progenitor and the first man who held the keys of the Priesthood on the earth. When I go there andmeet him, I shall have to render an account of what I do here. TheLord has chosen the weak things ofthe world to do His work. But Heis as able to teach me, or any of my brethren, as He ever has beenin any age of the world. He hasalways selected the weak things. Take Moses in leading the childrenof Israel. Moses said he was slow of speech, and he thought that hecould not do anything. But theLord said he would raise up a spokes-man for him. When the Lord want-ed a king for Israel, he chose David, the son of Jesse, who was herdingsheep. All the sons of Jesse, exceptDavid, were brought before the Prophet; but Samuel would notanoint either of them. He asked Jesse if he had any more sons. Jesse said, Yes; there is a little fellow down here taking care of the sheep. The Prophet wanted to see him. When he came, Samuel anointed him king of Israel. [##1 Samuel 16:2-13##] So in the days of the Apostles. Who were they? Illiterate fishermen. So it is to-day. Begin with Joseph Smith and take the whole of us. Who arewe? We are poor, weak wormsof the dust. But the Lord haschosen us because He thought He could do something with us. I hope He can. I suppose I haveheld the Apostleship longer than any man that has been on the face of the earth in these last days. Should I boast over this or be proudand exalted because I have held thePriesthood so long? If I did, I should be a very foolish man. Weare obliged to honor God; we areobliged to acknowledge the hand of God. The devil has sought to de-stroy me from the time I was born until the present day. But the Lordhas always been on my right hand and saved me. There have beentwo powers at work—one to destroyme, the other to save me. And Iam here today, a weak instrument in the hands of God. But, as Godlives, if He will tell me what myduty is, I am going to do it!I pray God to bless us, and awak-en us that we may see our positionon the earth. The eyes of all heav-en are over us. The Father, theSavior, Father Adam, the Patri-archs, the Prophets, and all theApostles who have lived in our dayand generation, are watching overus, and waiting for us to do our duty; and when we perform that,the judgments of God will be mani-fest in the earth. I pray God to give us wisdom, and to help us to behumble, faithful, meek and lowly of heart. Look at the purity of theSavior, from the manger to the grave, and where is there aman on the face of the earth that canfeel anything like exaltation orglory? I have seen Oliver Cow-dery when it seemed as though the earth trembled under his feet. I never heard a man bear a strongertestimony than he did when under the influence of the Spirit. But themoment he left the kingdom of God,that moment his power fell likelightning from heaven. He was shorn of his strength, like Samson in the lap of Delilah. [##Judges 16:15-19##] He lost the power and testimony which he had enjoyed, and he never recovered itagain in its fulness while in theflesh, although he died in theChurch. It does not pay a man to sin or to do wrong. BrotherCannon spoke about difficulties be-tween ourselves. What business have we to go to law because of a little water or anything else on the earth? When we do this wehave lost the Spirit of the Gospel.You have had good counsel with re-gard to this, and if you carry it outthe blessings of the Lord will at-tend you. I hope the people ofProvo will look to this. We should be united and stand together in themidst of the opposition that we willhave to meet. I hope this powerand influence will dwell in this county and throughout these moun-tains of Israel, which may Godgrant, for Christ's sake. Amen.

 REMARKSBy President Wilford Woodruff, atthe Sanpete Stake Conference,held at Manti, Sunday and Mon-day, May 19 and 20, 1889.REPORTED BY A.

Itis a great blessing to be able to comehere as free men, and to have theopportunity of opening our mouthsand teaching the people as we aremoved upon by the Spirit of theLord. I have no right to say thatit has been so long since we preachedto the people that we have forgottenhow; but I have a right to say thatwe are just as much dependent todayupon the Lord for His Holy Spirit,to guide us in our teaching and in-struction to the people, as we everwere. And in order for us to enjoythis blessing, we need the faith andprayers of the Latter-day Saints 
 DISCOURSEDelivered by President Wilford Wood-ruff at the General Conference, Salt Lake City, on Sunday after-noon, April 7, 1889.REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.While the Sacrament is being passed to this congregation I will try to make a few remarks; but whether or not I shall be heard by this assembly I cannot say.If after the scene we have passed through during the last hour anyman can answer his mind and sat-isfy himself before an assembly of this kind to occupy the position that I do, unless he is assisted by theGod of Israel, he is made of differ-ent material to what I am. That which we have had before us this afternoon is a testimony to heaven and earth that what has been pre-sented here could not have beenwitnessed in the midst of any other people on the face of the earth, unless that people werethe children of God. Here we havehad ten thousand men and women lift up their hands in a vote to sus-tain not only the Presidency of the Church and the Twelve Apostles,but other men in their various po-sitions, and without a dissentingvote. Where on the earth can ascene of this kind be seen exceptamong the Latter-day Saints?I feel it my privilege, right and duty to now make a few remarks with regard to myself and the deal-ings of God with me. But before doing that I will say that the Lord has never set His hand, in any age of the world, to perform a work among the sons of Adam, but Hehas prepared an element for that work. You will see this in the whole history of His dealings with the human family. It is so in thegeneration in which we live. The God of heaven, having set His hand to carry out His great purposes anddecrees, which have been revealedin the records of divine truth, has been under the necessity of pre-paring a people to take hold of andto perform the work which He hasdecreed should come to pass. Ten thousand of that people are beforeme today, with tens of thousands throughout the land.With regard to myself I will saythat in my early youth, while read-ing the Bible — the record of Judah, and the New Testament — I read ofJesus Christ, of His Apostles, their works, and the dealings of Godwith them, and of the doctrines which they received and taught tothose around them. There was something glorious in those prin-ciples which the Savior of the world and His disciples taught in their day. I had a great desire in my boyhood and youth that I might live to behold a people who were in-spired of the Almighty, and who had power and authority to go forth and teach those principles which I read of within the lids of the Bible.At that time I could not hear themtaught. They were not taught by any person within my knowledge.But, as I have said, I had a long-ing desire that I might live to be-hold a people on the earth whowould teach these principles to me. I spent many a midnight hour inmy mill, and among the rocks, inthe forests and in the fields, in pour-ing out my soul to God and praying that I might live to behold a peopleon the earth who would teach theseprinciples. In answer to my pray-ers, the God of heaven promised me that I should live to find such a peo-ple. He promised me that I should have a name and a place within theHouse of God and among His peo-ple — a name that should not be cut off. I am strongly impressed today,in reflecting upon our history andthe history of myself, and the posi-tion which I occupy, with the promises of God to me in those earlydays. They have been fulfilled; and this day has crowned the pinnacle of the responsibility which is placedupon my head. I marvel when Icontemplate these things, whichare in fulfillment of the promises of God unto me. And when I saythis of myself, I speak of hundredsof the Elders of Israel who have been moved upon in the same man-ner that I have been. Those with whom I stood connected in theearly period of the Church — theProphet Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, and those men that laid thefoundation of this Church and king-dom, together with other Prophetsand Patriarchs — have passed away.They are on the other side of theveil. I still have the privilege of

XXXIX.REMARKSBy President Wilford Woodruff, atGrantsville, (Tooele Stake Con-ference), Monday Morning, July29th, 1889.REPORTED BY A. WINTER.I am very much pleased at the re-port whch we have heard from thePresident and Bishops of this Stakeof Zion. I do not know of anyStake that we have visited that hasgiven as good a report, consideringall things, as has this Stake of Zion.I rejoice that you are united, forunion is what the Lord requiresof the Latter-day Saints; and if we are not one, we cannot be counted as the Lord's.Among other things, I am very much gratified at the report con-cerning our young people. I have, I may say, peculiar feelings with re-gard to the rising generation inthese mountains. I reflect a greatdeal concerning them and what before them. The organizationsamong the young people are of vastimportance, and the Lord has great-ly blessed these organizations, in rais-ing up men who have been inspiredto labor in connection therewith. These Associations have proved ablessing in years that are past, andthey are a blessing today. Hereare the Primaries. Our sisters or-ganize the children together in these Societies. This is the firststep after they leave, as it were, theinstruction and teaching of themother. The fathers sometimesteach them, I suppose; but, as arule, we regard the mother as the one who gives shape to the charac-ter of the child. I consider thatthe mother has a greater influenceover her posterity than any otherperson can have. And the questionhas arisen sometimes, "When doesthis education begin?" Our proph-ets have said, "When the spirit lifefrom God enters into the taber-nacle." The condition of themother at that time will have itseffect upon the fruit of her womb;and from the birth of the child, andall through life, the teachings andthe example of the mother governand control, in a great measure,that child, and her influence is feltby it through time and eternity.Our children go to the Primaries. There they are taught the first prin-ciples of the Gospel and about thebirth of Christ. This lays a founda-tion for them to build upon. Fromthe Primaries they go to the Sab-bath Schools. We have a verylarge number of children—oversixty thousand—enrolled in Sabbath Schools. President GeorgeQ. Cannon has taken an active partin the organization and conductingof these schools. He was inspiredto do this, and they have been agreat blessing to this people. From theSabbath Schools these childrengo to the Young Ladies' and YoungMen's Improvement Associations,there to continue improving them-selves. When we call for Elders togo abroad on missions we almost in-variably choose those who havegraduated in this manner.Well, I will tell you some of mythoughts and feelings with regardto our young men and maidens.Of course, I know and you knowthat this is the Kingdom of God.I know that this is the great andlast dispensation, which the God ofheaven ordained before this worldwas created; for I believe that theAlmighty knew what He was goingto do with this world before Hemade it. He knew what kind ofspirits were going to occupy it, andwhat kind of work would have tobe performed in order to save Hissons and daughters who shouldcome upon the earth. And in read-ing the history of the dealings ofGod with men, from the creation of the world to this dispensation, wesee the Father has labored to bless His sons and daughters. He gaveHis only begotten Son to die to re-deem the world—a sacrifice such asonly God himself could give. Andin these last days He has com-menced the organization of the greatand last dispensation—the great-est of all dispensations. Adam,Enoch, Moses, and the prophets sawour day. They had before them thevision and revelation of this work,and they prophesied concerning it.Now, the Lord has labored with usfor nearly sixty years since theorganization of this Church. It has grown like a little child from its mother's breast. It has grown like amustard seed, until it is becoming asa tree, for the fowls of the air tolodge in the branches thereof. Itshistory has been very peculiar insome respects; but it has laid the foundation for a great deal of faithin the minds of the honest and meek of the earth. We have had awarfare right from the time whenMoroni first visited Joseph Smith,before the latter received the plates. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:49-54##]Lucifer and all his evil spirits havelabored for the destruction of work. They labored to defeat, if possible, the going forth of the Bookof Mormon—the stick of Joseph inthe hands of Ephraim. [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##] JosephSmith himself, only fourteen yearsafter the Church was organized, was martyred. He had his blood shed, as a testimony of the truth of hismission. I have traveled withJoseph Smith many hundred miles.I have also traveled with BrighamYoung and the Apostles, and I havenever had any doubts with regardto the truth and final triumph of this work. I have none today. I have no doubts about Zion becom-ing all that the prophets saw it, inits glory, its power, its dominionand strength, with the power of God resting upon it.In view of all these things, thequestion which has arisen in my mind, and which has caused me a good deal of thought, is, who is going to take this kingdom andbear it off? Unto whom is theLord going to look to take thiskingdom in its final triumph and prepare it in its perfection and gloryfor the coming of the Son of Man?To our sons and daughters. It isthese young men and maidens whodwell in these valleys of the moun-tains that have got to asume this re-sponsibility. Upon their shouldersthis kingdom has got to rest, whentheir fathers and elders have passed to the other side of the vail. Thisis before me just as plain as the light of the sun in the firmament of heaven. And when I consider this, I ask myself, what condition are our young men and women in? 
 DISCOURSEBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,Delivered in the Tabernacle, atLogan, Sunday Morning,August 1st, 1880.REPORTED BY GEORGE F. GIBBS.It is a common saying with us, that the Lord has set his hand to build up his kingdom; but, notwithstand-ing, it is a true one, and it is a veryinteresting one. Let us turn ourminds which way we will, as menof God, as Elders in Israel, if we en-joy any portion of the Spirit of the Lord, we cannot help seeing thehand of the Lord in his works inthese mountains and in the earth. It is a difficult matter, many times,for men of the world to understandthe literal fulfilment of revelation;in fact, some of our leading men,men of wisdom, men who have en-joyed a good portion of the Spirit ofthe Lord—it has been difficult forthem to understand the fulfilmentof prophecy. In conversation with persons with regard to the affairs of our nation, I remember President Young telling them that there wouldbe a division in our nation betweenthe North and South. "But," said they, "that cannot be; the stability of our government is of too durable a nature to even permit of any suchthing." This is the way that ourleading men felt before the rebellion; this is the way, as a general thing,that leading men feel to-day. They cannot comprehend, it is not in theirhearts to believe in the fulfilment ofprophecy; they cannot understandhow it is that any power or wisdomthat God can exercise can bring topass the prophecies that remain tobe fulfilled. We had examples ofthis, as I have said. But the crisis came; a four years' war was waged,which laid in the grave a millionand a half of the strength of our na-tion, and, as I have often said, andwhich I believe is true, cost them a debt which they will never live to pay. They could not comprehendthis until it was over. It is so withour nation to-day; they cannotcomprehend, notwithstanding the mighty evidence that is rolling be-fore them like the waves of the sea,one event after another in their ful-filment; but they cannot realize howthe Lord can make use of the ele-ments known to mankind to bringabout the destruction of a nation likeours. When Brother John Morgan was speaking, I was reminded of a cer-tain spirit that arose in the hearts ofmen a few years go, incited through theoppression of capital against labor.A few men rose up in Pittsburgh and other places in Pennsylvania, andin three days destroyed some twenty million dollars worth of railroadproperty. When this element oncerises, what power has law, what power have the officers of the law orthe government to control it? It cannot be controlled by human power. As Latter-day Saints, wecan in a measure understand, whenwe come to reflect that God rulesand overrules and can do anythinghe has a mind to with regard to thefulfilment of these events. I believe the Bible; I believe the Book of Mor-mon; I believe the Doctrine and Covenants, and I believe that thepredictions they contain will in theirfulfilment roll upon our heads, andupon the heads of this nation, and upon the heads of the people of Zion,and the judgments of God, that havebeen proclaimed in the hearing ofthe people for the last fifty years, through the mouth of Joseph Smithand of Brigham Young and the apos-tles and the elders of Israel, by thegift and power of the Holy Ghost—not one jot or tittle of what has beendeclared will fall to be ground un-fulfilled, and the Latter-day Saintsought to be prepared for them. Iknow many of these things look dark when men look upon themwith the natural vision, and as a consequence doubt and unbelief fol-low; but when you look upon them with your mind enlightened by theSpirit of God, the spirit of inspira-tion and revelation, we then are ableto understand them, and how easily it is for God to bring to pass the pre-dictions of his servants.The Lord, in a revelation given toOrson Hyde and William McClellanin the early days of the Church, insending them out to preach the gos-pel, told them that when they preached they should speak as theywere moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and that if they did not have the Holy Spirit to direct them, theywere told not to teach. "And,"said the Lord, "when you do speak as you are moved upon by the HolyGhost, your words are the words of God, they are scripture, and theyare the mind of the Lord to the peo-ple." (##Doctrine and Covenants 68:4|Sec. 68.##) Many have an ideathat it is something very strange formen now-a-days to have revelation, and that nobody should have revela-tion excepting Brother Taylor. Here, my brethren and sisters, youare upholding the quorum of theTwelve twice a year in General Con-ference, besides doing so at your quarterly conference, as prophets, seers and revelators, and you pray for them twice a day, and perhaps oftener, and should it be anythingvery strange if they should receivea revelation? How strange, indeed! There are in this Church some six thousand seventies, and four thou-sand high priests, and four thousand elders, who hold the Melchisedecpriesthood, which is after the orderof the Son of God, besides manythousands of priests holding theAaronic priesthood, and I would like to ask, if it was wrong to desire revelation? What business have we with this priesthood, if we have not power to receive revelation? Whatis the priesthood given for? If wedo not have revelation, it is becausewe do not live as we should live,because we do not magnify our priesthood as we ought to; if we didwe would not be without revelation,none would be barren or unfruitful.We have one man who holds the keys of the kingdom of God upon the earth, and it is his business togive the word of the Lord for theguidance of the Church. But herewe have apostles and men of God, holding the holy priesthood, acting in behalf of the Church in differentparts of this Territory, and also indifferent parts of the earth; and we have men, say, acting as Churchagents in Europe, part of whosebusiness it is to charter ships for the transit across the ocean of tens ofthousands of the people of God; is itthe right of such men to have reve-lation from the Lord to guide themin their operations? Yes, it is; and no man should undertake to act inpositions affecting the interests ofZion, unless he lives so as to be guid-ed and directed by revelations of God. And every man who presidesover a temple should live day by day in the revelations of JesusChrist. And every seventy, andevery high priest, and every manbearing the holy priesthood should live in that way to get revelation toguide and direct him in his labors.This idea that no man has any right to call upon God and receive revela-tion is wrong, and it has been wrongwhenever it has existed in any age of the world. As was said of old,when a complaint was made con-cerning certain of the elders prophe-sying in the Camp of Israel, so sayI: "I would to God that all were prophets;" because the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus.With regard to prophesying, I wishto say, that we have a great manytimes the revelations of God given unto us through his spirit, when we do not comprehend what revelationis. How many of you have had thestill small voice of the spirit whisper things to you, and when you have followed the dictations of that spirit it has become in you a principle ofrevelation. I would not be here to-day if I had not listened to thewhisperings of that still small voicewhich has guided me in my journey-ings; I never could have passedthrough the dangerous scenes and incidents of my life had I not fol-lowed the whisperings of the spiritof the Lord to me. And with regard to our preaching I will say, that asapostles of God and as men appointed to lead and guide Israel, we have a great many things presented to ourminds that at the time appear to bebeyond our comprehension. BrotherHeber C. Kimball, for instance, was a natural prophet; he would at times give utterance to things whenpreaching under the influence of the holy Spirit that would frighten himself, and has many times been known to say after he had finishedpreaching, "What have I said?" I am reminded of a circumstance which occurred in the early settle-ment of Utah, at a time when wewere all in very destitute circum-stances, without the shadow of anyreasonable hope for seeing better times. At such a time Brother Kimball in preaching one day told the congregation that many monthswould not pass before we would be able to buy goods in Salt Lake City as cheaply as they could be boughtin New York City. When BrotherKimball had said this he actually feltfrightened for he could not see how it could come to pass, but it was spoken under the influence of the HolyGhost and therefore it was revela-tion. I was thinking to-day of atime, many years ago, when PresidentYoung and several of the brethren of the Twelve, were in Logan; it wasa time when a railroad up to thisregion was not even dreamed of, the time when Brothers Ezra T. Benson and Peter Maughan presided here;when at a meeting President Youngcalled upon me to talk to the peopleassembled. The night before, how-ever, we had been met by a long line of children and young people, from 3 up to 20 years of age; theyhad come out to meet the Prophet, and presented a fine sight. While talking to the people I felt led to speak to the children and young peo-ple; and I told them that I wantedthem to remember the visit whichthe President was making them be-cause the day would come whenthey were grown up, when they would talk to one another and say, that on such a time President Young and party visited us, and we weretold then that we should see the day when a temple should be built inthis place, from the top of which wewould be able to survey the country around which would be occupied byten thousand of our people; and youwill say that this was told to uswhen Brother Benson and BrotherMaughan presided here. We neverthought of building a temple hereat that time, it had never entered into the heart of men to do so. Bro-thers Benson and Maughan havebeen for some years now in the spirit world. To-day you are engagedbuilding a temple which will be com-pleted and dedicated to the name ofthe Lord; and when this shall be done these young people will havethe opportunity of going to the topof the building and will then seewhat I promised to you in thoseearly days.I mention this to show you how things are presented to our minds and given utterance to in ourpublic teachings about which, at thetime, we have little or no idea.When in the western country,many years ago, before we came tothe Rocky Mountains, I had a dream.I dreamed of being in these moun-tains, and of seeing a large fine look-ing temple erected in one of thesevalleys which was built of cut gran-ite stone, I saw that temple dedi-cated, and I attended the dedicatory services, and I saw a good many men there that are living to-day in the midst of this people. And I saw them called of God and sent forth unto the United States and to Baby-lon, or what is called the Christian world, to bind up the law and seal up the testimony against the nations of the earth, because they had re-jected the testimony of Jesus and ofthe establishment of the kingdom of God upon the earth. When thefoundation of that temple was laid I thought of my dream and a great many times since. And whenever President Young held a council ofthe brethren of the Twelve and talkof building the temple of adobe or brick, which was done I would sayto myself "No, you will never do it;" because I had seen it in my dream built of some other material. I men-tion these things to show you thatthings are manifested to the Latter-day Saints sometimes which we donot know any thing about, only as they are given by the Spirit ofGod.I will say to Israel who are here to-day, we should take hold of this work in earnest and build this tem-ple and redeem the dead as well as the living; and have faith in God believing that this is the work of God which will roll on to its fulfil-ment in the earth. God will not dis-appoint you in these the last days;he will not disappoint the wicked, hewill not disappoint the devils in hell, nor the angels of God in the heavenwill not be disappointed with regardto the fulfilment of the revelations;whatever may be the unbelief of this generation it will make no differ-ence with regard to the fulfilment of the revelations of God and the predictions of his servants.When in the Tabernacle at SaltLake City on the 24th of July, inlooking upon the assembled mul-titude and in contemplating themagnetude and grandeur of the pro-cession I said to myself "What canbe the feelings of the world?" What can be the feelings of our enemieswho are laboring to "break up Mormonism'" and who have forthese many years past indulged inthe fond expectation, and haveeven gone so far as to predictyear after year that in a few years more "Mormonism" will be done away. The world do not know what to do with "Mormon-ism;" the heads of our own nationand the kings of the earth are alikeundecided, with regard to this hand-ful of people that are growing up inthese mountains. They see ourunion and the work already accom-plished by us; they see the elementsof prosperity and power manifestedin this people, and although they donot say it themselves it is a fact, thespirit of fear to a degree is takenhold of them, they are afraid thatthe "Mormons" tell the truth when they say the God of heaven has set his hand again for the last time toestablish his rule and governmentin the earth, which is destined tobecome a great kingdom and fill thewhole earth. The great men of theearth are not ignorant of the exist-ence of this people; they are studyingour history, and they are watching the result of our labors. Althoughwe are located in the interior of thismountain country, and so recently considered without the pale of civ-ilization, the Latter-day Saints arenot hid from view, their light is notunder a bushel, but they are already known and talked of throughout all Christendom; and this Zion will continue to grow and no power willhinder it. Let us prepare ourselvesand keep the faith, obey the com-mandments of God and exercise faithin these things; and let our prayers as-cend into the ears of the God, of Sabathday and night, for the fulfilment ofthese revelations and prophecies.The Lamanites will fulfill all thatGod has said about them, and theJews will fulfill and realize all thathas been said respecting them and all that has been promised and pre-dicted upon their heads by theirfather Jacob and by the prophets.It was foretold by the prophet Mosesthat they should be driven and des-pised by their enemies, and thatthey should be cursed of God, and that his curse should follow themuntil Christ came; and that they would reject him, and then they would be scattered as corn is siftedin a seive,etc. [##Amos 9:9##] But hear it all Israel, after your sorrow and pain and dis-tress and after the days of your trib-ulation, your great Eloheim will stretch out his hand and gather you from every nation wherever you are driven, and he will bring you hometo your own land, and you shall re-build, your temple and city, and youshall be delivered by Shiloh when he comes. That will be fulfilled; and all that God has said with re-gard to the ten tribes of Israel, strange as it may appear, will come to pass. They will, as has been saidconcerning them, smite the rock,and the mountains of ice will flowbefore them, and a great high way will be cast up, and their enemies will become a prey to them; and their records, and their choice treasures they will bring with them to Zion.These things are as true as God lives.When I contemplate the condition of our nation, and see that wicked-ness and abominations are increas-ing, so much so that the whole heav-ens groan and weep over the abomi-nations of this nation and the na-tions of the earth, I ask myself the question, can the American nation escape? The answer comes, No; itsdestruction, as well as the destruc-tion of the world, is sure; just assure as the Lord cut off and de-stroyed the two great and prosperousnations that once inhabited thiscontinent of North and South Amer-ica, because of their wickedness, sowill he them destroy, and sooner orlater they wili reap the fruits of their own wicked acts, and be num-bered among the past.I cannot help it; I would to God they would repent, that their eyes might be opened to see their condi-tion; but the devil has power overthem; he rules the children of men,he holds Babylon in his own hand,and leads the people whithersoever he will. There are changes await-ing us, they are even nigh at ourvery doors, and I know it by the revelations of Jesus Christ; I knowit by the visions of heaven; I knowit by the administrations of angels, and I know it by the inspiration ofheaven, that is given to all menwho seek the Lord; and the hand ofGod will not stay these things. Wehave no time to lose.I pray God's blessing upon the men working on the temple, andhis blessing upon the Saints, thattheir hearts may be inclined to buildthem. If you knew and understood the feelings of the Prophet JosephSmith, and those of his brethren as-sociated with him, and the feelingsof the millions of the human familywho are shut up in their prison houses we would not tire, we would labor with all our might until thebuilding was finished and dedicated,and then we would labor for the re-demption of our dead. Ask BishopHunter if he ever expects to meetwith his friends and associate withthose who have passed away, unlesshe redeems them in the flesh, andhe will tell you, no. He could notmingle with them if he did not re-deem them in the flesh. I know thesame, too.I pray God to bless you, and to pour out his spirit upon my brethrenof the quorum of the Twelve, that we may walk in the light and be guided aright in all our ministra-tions. And I tell you again, God will not disappoint you; this king-dom will never go backward, neitherwill it ever be given into the handsof another people; but it will restupon the shoulders of our sons anddaughters when Christ comes in theclouds of heaven. We have no timeto throw away, or spend in the fool-ish things of the flesh; what time is at our disposal should be used in building up the Zion of God, and inpreparing ourselves and our familiesfor the things that await us.  Oh, I wish many times that the veil waslifted from off the faces of the Lat-ter-day Saints; I wish we could seeand know the things of God as theydo who are laboring for the salvationof the human family who are in thespirit world; for if this were so, thiswhole people, with very few, if any,exceptions, would lose all interest inthe riches of the world, and instead thereof their whole desires and la-bors would be directed to redeem their dead, to perform faithfully the work and mission given us on earth; so that when we ourselves should pass behind the veil and meet withJoseph and the ancient apostles, andothers who are watching over usand who are deeply interested in our labors, we might feel satisfied inhaving done our duty.This is how I feel, this is my faith.I read the Bible, the Book of Mor-mon and the Book of Covenants,and I look for everything containedin them to be fulfilled. We aremaking history day by day, and we are fulfilling the events which the old prophets saw, and which they predicted would transpire in thelatter days. Isaiah, when he saw in vision this people in the mountains, exclaims:"Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into sing-ing, O mountains; for the Lord hathcomforted his people, and will have mercy on his afflicted."But Zion said, The Lord hath for-saken me, and my Lord hath for-gotten me."Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she could not have com-passion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I notforget thee." [##Isaiah 49:13-15##]In the own due time of the Lordall things spoken by the prophetswill be literally fulfilled.I pray God to help us to do ourduty and to help us to feel interestedin our labors in the flesh.  And as aclosing remark, seeing that this iselection time, I will say, do not, mybrethren, allow the spirit of conten-tion and dissension to creep in amongyou. I am ashamed of some of ourpeople who, instead of using theirpowers and influence in endeavoring to unite the people, go to work and stir up strife, and the result is that in some of our cities an oppositionticket is gotten up, and our own peo-ple in these places divide one againstthe other. I say, shame on the elder or man holding the priesthood, the authority delegated to him byhigh heaven, who will do this thing;the heavens are displeased with such a man, and unless he repents he willcertainly be found numbered withthose who are arrayed against God and his kingdom in the earth. Wehave the whole world against us, besides many evil spirits to contendwith, and we certainly should not divide one against another.May God bless Israel, is my prayer, through Jesus Christ. Amen.

 DISCOURSEBYElder WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVEREDAt the Semi-Annual Conference, inthe New Tabernacle, SaltLake City, Oct. 8, 1873.REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.I AM called upon to occupy a little time this morning, and I realize that I and my brethren are all de-pendent upon the Spirit of God to guide, dictate and direct us in all our public teachings, as well as in all other acts we are called upon to perform in the kingdom of God. The apostle says there is no pro-phecy of the Scripture which is of any private interpretation, butholy men of old spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. The Lord has told us in some ofthe revelations which he has given in our day that all of his messen-gers or servants, his Elders who are sent forth to teach, should speak asthey are moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and when they follow this counsel what they say, the Lord says, is Scripture, it is the mind and will of the Lord, it is the wordof the Lord and it is the power ofGod unto salvation. "And this is an ensample unto you, even all my servants who go forth to declare the words of life unto the inhabi-tants of the earth."Again, the Lord has said that it matters not whether it be by my own voice out of the heavens, whether it be by the administer-ing of angels, or whether it be bythe voice of my servants, it is allthe same, and their words shall befulfilled though the heavens and the earth pass away. This is theposition which the prophets, apos-tles and patriarchs have occupiedupon the earth in every age and dispensation. They have had to be governed by the Spirit of God; and when men are sent with a mes-sage, and they speak as they aremoved upon by the Holy Ghost,their words are the words of the Lord and they will be fulfilled.We have had a good deal of teach-ing during this Conference from the servants of God, teachings given by the inspiration of theHoly Ghost. We occupy a very peculiar position on the earth, aposition differing in many respects from any other dispensation to men. Paul says—"Though we or an angel from heaven preach unto you any other gospel than thatwhich we have preached, let him be accursed." All the teachings of the patriarchs and prophets haveshown us but one gospel. There is but one gospel, there never was but one and there never will be. The gospel revealed for the salvation of manis the same in every age of theworld. Adam, our first great pro-genitor and father, after the fall,received this gospel, and he received the holy priesthood in all its power, and its keys and ordinances. He sealed these blessings upon his sons—Seth, Enos, Jared, Cainan, Ma-haleel, Enoch and Methusaleh. All these men received this high andholy priesthood. They all professedto give revelation. They all had inspiration and left their record on the earth; and not one of them but what saw and prophecied about thegreat Zion of God in the latter-days.And when we say this of themwe say it of every apostle and pro-phet who ever lived upon the earth.Their revelations and prophecies allpoint to our day and that greatkingdom of God which was spoken of by Daniel, that great Zion of God spoken of by Isaiah and Jere-miah; and that great gathering ofthe house of Israel spoken of by Ezekiel and Malachi and many of the ancient patriarchs and pro-phets.When the Lord has attempted to perform a work on the earth therehas been one peculiarity with him, and that is, the instruments which he has made use of have occupied a peculiar position in the world. He has generally chosen the weakthings of the world to confound the wise, and things that were nought to bring to pass thingswhich were. When he wanted a man to deliver Israel, he called Mo-ses, who was in an ark of bulrushesamong the crocodiles and aligatorsof the river Nile, put there by his mother, a Hebrew woman, because Moses was her first born, and allthe first born of the Hebrews had to be slain. The daughter of Pharaoh, through the providence of God,preserved Moses, and by her he was given to his mother to raise. Whencalled to deliver Israel, Moses toldthe Lord that he was a man slow of speech. He did not feel qualifiedto perform so great a work, yet theLord chose him, and he performed the work the Lord assigned him.So when the Lord wanted a king for Israel and the lot fell upon the family of Jesse. The Prophetwent and called for the sons of Jessto pick out this king. All the boys were brought before him exceptDavid. He was the smallest of the flock, and was out taking care of the sheep. Jesse never thought ofhim at all. He brought his othersons, who had been trained in allthe arts, sciences and learning of the day, and when they came in Samuel could not see the one hewanted. He asked Jesse if he had not any more sons. Yes, he had aboy taking care of the sheep. "Let's see him," said the prophet; and when he came he was anointed king.Jesus himself was born in a stableand cradled in a manger and travel-ed in poverty all the way through his life. When he chose his disciples he did not take the great, learned, rich and noble of that generation,but he chose fishermen, the most illiterate men and, in one sense of the word, we may say, almost the lowest calling among men in thatday. They were the ones the Lord made use of to go forth to preach his gospel and to build up his king-dom on the earth.How is it in our day, in this great and last dispensation? The Lord required an instrument who wouldtake hold and work with him. He required some one to lay the found-ation of this great church and king-dom who would be willing to step forth and be led in the channel thatwas according to the mind and willof God, a man who could not beswayed by the traditions and relig-ions of the day. Whom did theLord call? The patriarchs and pro-phets not only pointed out the Zion of God and the manner in which his church and kingdom should be established and built up, but they even called the name of the manwho should be called to establishthis work, and I do not know but the name of his father. His namewas to be Joseph and he was to be a lineal descendant of ancient Joseph,who was sold into Egypt, separated from his brethren. The record orstick of Joseph in the hand of Ephraim, which Ezekiel speaks of,which was to be put with the record of the Jews in the last days, was tobe an instrument in the hands of God of performing this great workor laying the foundation of thischurch, and the gathering of the twelve tribes of the house of Israel.In that record the man's name was pointed out as well as the work hewas to do. Joseph Smith knew nothing of all this until after hewas administered to by the angel of God; he had no knowledge of thiswhen he brought forth that recordto the world, and until he translatedit, by the Urim and Thummim, into the English language. Hehad no knowledge whatever of this;but here was that great band, asstrong as iron, that surrounded him by the revelations of God, for thelast six thousand years, by every man who spoke of the work of God in the last days. These prophecies, revelations, and decrees of the Al-mighty, as it were, surrounded thatman, and he had to be taught, notby man nor by the will of man, buthe required the angels of God tocome forth and teach him; it re-quired the revelations of God to teach him, and he was taught foryears by visions and revelations, and by holy angels sent from God out of heaven to teach and instructhim and prepare him to lay the foundation of this church.As I before remarked, these pro-phecies surrounded him, forming, in one sense of the word, a band and a power he could not get out of.Why? Besause no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpre-tation, but holy men of old spoke asthey were moved upon by the in-spiration of the Holy Ghost, and when any of those prophets and patriarchs for the last six thousand years spoke, when wrapped in pro-phetic vision, of the Zion of God being established in the last dispen-sation, those decrees had to be ful-filled to the very letter.When Joseph Smith received these revelations he was an illiter-ate boy, like David among the sheep. The Lord, in this day, didnot choose one from among the great, mighty, rich or noble, but hechoose one prepared from before thefoundation of the world, to come forth in the last days, through the loins of ancient Joseph who, in thehands of God, was the savior of the house of Israel and of the Egypt-ians in his day. This man was raised up in his proper time, and came forth into the world, and the Lord began to feel after him and toprepare him; but he, himself, did not know even when he laid thefoundation of this work. The Lordtold him—"you will lay the found-ation of a great work, but you know it not." Joseph himself could notcomprehend, unless he was wrap-ped in the visions of eternity, the importance of the work the founda-tion of which he had laid. When his mind was opened he could un-derstand, in many respects, the de-signs of God; and these revelations were around him and they guided his footsteps. They could not failof fulfillment, they had to be ac-complished in the earth. The ser-vant of God came forth and he re-ceived the Book of Mormon—the record or stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim. He broughtforth that record according to the dictation of Moroni, Nephi andLehi, the angels of God who admin-istered to him, and he translated itinto the English language. before he laid the foundation of this church. Joseph Smith did not call upon any man to ordain or to bap-tize him, but he waited until theLord sent forth his servants to ad-minister unto him. He was com-manded of the Lord to go forth andbe baptized, but not until he had received the priesthood. Where did he get it, and in fact what is the priesthood? It is the authority of God in heaven to the sons of men to administer in any of the ordinancesof his house. There never was a man and never will be a man, in this or any other age of the world, who has power and authority to ad-minister in one of the ordinances of the house of God, unless he is call-ed of God as was Aaron, unless he has the holy priesthood and is ad-ministered to by those holding thatauthority.There was no man on the face ofthe earth, nor had not been for the last seventeen centuries, who had power and authority from God to goforth and administer in one of theordinances of the house of God. What did he do then? Why, the Lord sent unto him John the Bap-tist, who, when upon the earth, held the Aaronic priesthood, who was beheaded for the word of God andthe testimony of Jesus Christ. He laid his hands upon the head ofJoseph Smith and ordained him tothe Aaronic priesthood, and he neverattempted to act in any authority ofthe gospel until he received this priesthood. Joseph was then qual-ified to baptize for the remission of sins, but he had not the authority to lay on hands for the reception ofthe Holy Ghost, and he never at-tempted to administer in this ordi-nance until Peter, James and John, two of whom—Peter and James—were also martyred for the testimo-ny of Jesus and the word of God. These three men were the last who held the keys of the Apostleship inits fullness and power previous tothis dispensation. They laid their hands upon the head of Joseph Smith, and sealed upon him every power, principle, ordinance and key belonging to the Apostleship, and until he received this ordination he was not qualified and had no rightto administer in the ordinances ofthe house of God, but he did this after he received the priesthood, and on the 6th day of april, 1830, he or-ganized this church with six mem-bers, which was the foundation of what we see to-day in this taberna-cle, and for six hundred miles through this American desert. Thishas all come from that small seed—the foundation of the great king-dom of our God upon the earth.What did Joseph Smith do afterhaving received this priesthood andits ordinances? I will tell you what he did. He did that which seven-teen centuries and fifty generations,that have passed and gone, of all the clergy and religions of Chris-tendom, and the whole world com-bined were not able to do—he, al-though an illiterate youth, present-ed to the world the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its fullness, plainness and simplicity, as taught by its Author and his apostles; he presented the church of Jesus Christ and thekingdom of God perfect in their or-ganization, as Paul represents them—with head and feet, arms and hands, every member of the bodyperfect before heaven and earth.How could he, an illiterate boy, dothat which the whole of the learn-ing of the Christian world for seventeen centuries failed to do? Be-cause he was moved upon by the power of God, he was instructed by those men who, when in the flesh, had preached the same gospel them-selves, and in doing this he fulfilled that which Father Adam, Enoch, Moses, Elias, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Jesus and his apostles all propheciedabout. Well might Paul say—"I am not ashamed of the gospel ofChrist, for it is the power of Godunto salvation unto every one thatbelieves." So may the Latter-day Saints say—"We are not ashamed of the gospel of Christ." I am notashamed to say that Joseph Smithwas a prophet of God; I am not ashamed to bear record that he was called of God, and laid the founda-tion of this church and kingdom onthe earth, for this is true, and anyman or woman who is inspired by the Holy Ghost can see and under-stand these things.My brethren and sisters and friends, here is laid the foundation of the fulfillment of that mightyflood of prophecy delivered since the days of Father Adam down to the last prophet who breathed the breath of life. There has been moreprophecy fulfilled in the last forty-three years upon the face of the earth, than in two thousand years before. These mighty prophecies, as I said before, like a band of iron, governed and controlled Joseph Smith in his labors while he livedon the earth. He lived until he received every key, ordinance andlaw ever given to any may on theearth, from Father Adam down, touching this dispensation. He re-ceived powers and keys from under the hands of Moses for gathering the house of Israel in the last days; he received under the hands of Elias the keys of sealing the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers; he received under the hands of Peter,James and John the apostleship, and everything belonging thereto; he received under the hands ofMoroni all the keys and powers re-quired of the stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim; he received under the hand of John the Bap-tist the Aaronic priesthood, with all its keys and powers, and everyother key and power belonging to this dispensation, and I am not ashamed to say that he was a pro-phet of God, and he laid the founda-tion of the greatest work and dis-pensation that has ever been estab-lished on the earth.Joseph Smith lived until he gave his testament to the world, and when he had sealed all these keys,powers and blessings upon the headof Brigham Young and his breth-ren; when he had planted these keys on the earth so that they should be removed no more forever;when he had done this, and brought forth that record, that book of rev-alation, the proclamation of whichinvolved the destiny of this whole generation—Jew, Gentile, Zion and Babylon, all the nations of the earth, he sealed that testimony withhis blood in Carthage jail, where his life and that of his brother Hy-rum were taken by the hands of wicked and ungodly men. Whywas his life taken? Why were notJohn Taylor and Willard Richards,the only two of the Twelve at thattime in Nauvoo and with him, also sacrificed? Why did Willard Richards, the largest man in the prison, stand in the midst of thatshower of balls and escape without a hole in his robe or garment, or clothing? Because these thingswere all governed and controlled bythe revelations of God and the word of the Lord. The Lord took whomhe would take and he preserved whom he would preserve, and he has done this all the way through. Why has Brigham Young been preserved, when he has stood asmuch chance to lay down his life indefence of this cause, and run asmany dangers in one position andanother as anybody else? Because the Lord has had a hand and a meaning in this, and he has pre-served him for a certain purpose, and other men have been preserved by the same power. The whole of it has been the work of God on the earth. The revelations of God have surrounded Brigham Young. The revelations of God in ancient days affect him and the apostles, and the elders of Israel, as much as they have affected any people in any generation.I will speak of another branch of this subject. We have the king-dom organized, the prophecies have been fulfilled, the church has been planted in the earth, and now thereare other portions of these revela-tions which must be fulfilled. We were settled in Jackson County, Clay County, Caldwell County, in Kirtland and finally in Nauvoo.We were driven from one place to another until we settled Nauvoo,and at last we were driven from Nauvoo into the wilderness and to this land, led here by President Brigham Young under the inspira-tion of Almighty God. Some felt their faith tried that we had to leaveour lovely Nauvoo and go into the wilderness. Bless your souls, therewould have been a flood of revela-tion unfulfilled if these things hadnot been so. Isaiah speaks of the foundation of this great Zion, and writes the whole of her history and travels up to the present day, and from this time on until the windingup scene. If we had not been drivenfrom Nauvoo we would never havecome up the Platte river, where, Isaiah says, he saw the Saints going by the river of water wherein went no galley with oars; a great compa-ny of women with child and her thattravailed with child would never have come here to the moun-tains of Israel if we had not been driven from that land, and a whole flood of prophecy would have re-mained unfulfilled, with regard to our making this desert blossom as the rose, the waters coming forthout of the barren desert, our building the house of God on the tops of the mountains, lifting up a standard for these nations to flee to; all thisand much more would have remain-ed unfulfilled had we not been guid-ed and led by the strong arm of Je-hovah, whose words must be ful-filled though the heavens and the earth pass away.Having been brought to Zion an-other subject presents itself to ourconsideration—namely, the positionwhich President Young occupies inregard to us to-day. He calls uponus to build temples, cities, townsand villages, and to do a great dealof temporal work. Strangers andthe Christian world marvel at the"Mormons" talking about temporalthings. Bless your souls, two thirdsof all the revelations given in thisworld rest upon the accomplish-ment of this temporal work. Wehave it to do, we can't build up Zi-on sitting on a hemlock slab sing-ing ourselves away to everlastingbliss; we have to cultivate the earth,to take the rocks and elements outof the mountains and rear templesto the Most High God; and thistemporal work is demanded at ourhands by the God of heaven, asmuch as he require Christ to dieto redeem the world, or as much asthe Savior required Peter, Jamesand John to go and preach the gos-pel to the nations of the earth. Thisis the great dispensation in whichthe Zion of God must be built up,and we as Latter-day Saints have itto build. People think it strange be-cause so much is said with regard to this. I will tell you Latter-daySaints, and the Christian world too,our work will fall short, we willcome short of our duties, and wenever shall perform the work thatGod Almighty has decreed weshall perform unless we enter intothese temporal things. We are obliged to build cities, town and villages, and we are obliged to gath-er the people from every nationunder heaven to the Zion of God,that they may be taught in theways of the Lord. We have onlyjust begun to prepare for the celes-tial law when we are baptized intothe Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-ter-day Saints.There has been a good deal said here with regard to baptism for the dead. When Joseph Smith had laid the foundation of this work he was taken away. There are good reasons why it was so. Jesus sealedhis testimony with his blood. Joseph Smith did the same, and from the day he died his testimony has been in force upon the whole world. He has gone into the spirit world and organized this dispensation on that side of the vail; he is gathering to-gether the elders of Israel and the Saints of God in the spirit world, for they have a work to do there as well as here. Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Father Smith, David Patten and the other elders who have been called to the other side of the vailhave fifty times as many people to preach to as we have on the earth. There they have all the spirits who have lived on the earth in seven-teen centuries—fifty generations, fifty thousand millions of persons who lived and died here without having seen a prophet or apostle, and without having the word of theLord sent unto them. They are shut up in prison, awaiting the mes-sage of the elders of Israel. Wehave only about a thousand mil-lions of people on the earth, but in the spirit world they have fifty thou-sand millions; and there is not a sin-gle revelation which gives us any reason to believe that any man who

 who assemble to be taught. Everyman in the Church of God on theearth should be able to speak as heis moved upon by the Holy Ghost.Then his words are the word of theLord, the mind of the Lord, thewill of the Lord, and they arescripture.Of all people that have ever lived,the Latter-day Saints have thegreatest reason to be thankful to theLord. We possess the fulness of theGospel and are members of theChurch of Jesus Christ. We oc-cupy a place in that land whichwas given to Joseph by his father—the land of America. [##2 Nephi 3:3-5##] We have re-ceived the organization of the greatKingdom of our God—that king-dom which was spoken of by Adam,by Daniel, and by all the ancientprophets whose eyes have been uponthis age of the world. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] We arebuilding up Zion in the very placeand on the very continent whichthe Lord designed. Therefore, whyshould we not be happy? Whyshould we not be contented? Whyshould we not be united together tocarry out the purposes of the Lord?We should be. There is no manwho has received this Gospel andenjoys the Holy Ghost but can re-joice and be thankful, and be wil-ling to pass through whatever trialsor afflictions he may be called uponto endure for the Gospel's sake. Ifeel to rejoice myself at this timethat we have the privilege of meet-ing together in peace. When I con-template our position as Lat-ter-day Saints, and the re-sponsibilities that we are under,I feel that our hearts and our soulsshould be drawn out in thanksgiv-ing to God. We should labor forthe building up of the Kingdom ofGod and for the establishment ofHis work; for we have been calledof God and appointed to take thiskingdom in the latter days and bearit off. We have promises givenunto us that no other dispensationor generation of men ever had. Ithas been promised us that we shallpossess the kingdom and the great-ness of the kingdom, and it willnever be overthrown, but will re-main until Jesus Christ, the greatlawgiver to Israel, comes to reignover His people. Therefore, weneed not think that we have noth-ing to do. We have a great workbefore us, and it will require all ourexertions and all our talents andability to perform it. We must seekfor the Spirit of God to assist us;for without this Spirit we can ac-complish but very little.There is a subject pressing uponmy mind at the present time whichI want to speak upon. I refer to thetreatment of animals. My soul hasbeen pained a great deal by thetreatment which man extends to thebeasts of the field. Before therailroad was built across this conti-nent I crossed the plains severaltimes, and the abuse of animalswhich I then witnessed gave megreat pain. The Lord has givenunto us horses and cattle and otheranimals for our benefit. Not one ofthese animals can talk to us, and Itherefore look upon their ill-treat-ment as a great evil and a sin. Thisis a matter which the world considerof small consequence for the Presi-dent of a church to talk about. Ihave not done it heretofore, but Iam going to do it now.We all admire a fine horse. It isone of the noblest of animals. It isalso one of the most useful of ani-mals. The treatment that we ex-tend to horses, in many instances, isunjust and unrighteous. I have seenmen take a young horse that hadnever had a harness on. They haveharnessed it, and they have takena black-snake whip, and before itwas ever put to a wagon or any-thing of the kind they have whippedit almost to death. I have seenyoung men in these valleys do that.Does that horse know why he is thusabused? The man who does thiscommits a sin. When you harnessa young horse for the first time, heknows nothing about it and does notknow what to do. That horse shouldbe treated kindly, no matter whetherhe kicks, or jumps, or bites. Hedon't understand why that harnessis put on him, and the man who hasany kindness about him will treatthat animal kindly. If you do this,the horse will very soon learn whatyou want of him, and when he learnsthat, he will do it. Treat your ani-mals kindly and they will treat youkindly; they will do all you ask ofthem.Here is a young heifer. She hasa calf. A youug man goes to milkher. She has never been milkedbefore. She kicks and won't standstill. What does that young mando? He gets a club or something ofthe kind and goes to thrashing her.Now, whoever does that ought tobe thrashed himself. Treat thatanimal kindly. In a little whileshe will understand what is wantedof her and will then act all right.I want to see a change, especiallywith the Latter-day Saints, in theirtreatment of the beasts of the field.They have been given to us for ouruse. They are a great blessing tous, and we should treat them gent-ly and with consideration. It iswrong to exercise tyranny overanything. When I was a boy andwent to school, the schoolmasterused to come with a bundle of sticksabout eight feet long, and one of thefirst things we expected was to get awhipping. For anything thatwas not pleasing to him wewould get a terrible thrashing.What whipping I got then did notdo me any good. I have alwaysfelt that ill-treatment either of chil-dren or animals is all wrong. Kind-ness, gentleness and mercy are bet-ter every way. I would like thisprinciple instilled into the minds ofour young men, that they maycarry it out in all their acts in life.Tyranny is not good, whether it beexercised by kings, by presidents,or by the servants of God. Kindwords are far better than harshwords. If, when we have diffi-culties one with another, we wouldbe kind and affable to each other, wewould save ourselves a great deal oftrouble.I wonder if there is a man herewho ever gained anything by scold-ing or beating his wife or his chil-dren. I never saw auy good resultfrom it. You go into a family wherea man treats his wife and childrenkindly, and you will find that theywill treat him in the same way.Complaints reach me of the treat-ment of men to their wives. Theydo not provide for them. Theydo not treat them kindly. All thispains me. These things should notbe. Here is a man who has a wifeor wives. They have been givenunto him of the Lord. They haveplaced themselves under his direc-tion. This man is held responsibleby his Creator for the course whichhe pursues toward these women.He should be kind to them; and intheir afflictiou he should not tyran-nize over them, or scold them, orpain their hearts. We should bekind to one another, do good to oneanother, and labor to promote thewelfare, the interest and the happi-ness of each other, especially thoseof our own households. The manstands at the head of the family.He is the patriarch of his house-hold. I have attended meetings inthis Church where one man has hadalmost a congregation of sons anddaughters. There is no more beauti-ful sight on earth than to see aman stand at the head of his familyand teach them righteous principlesand give them good counsel. Thesechildren honor their father, andthey take consolation and joy inhaving a father who is a righteousman.Our sisters, also, have their dutiesto perform to their husbands. Theyshould consider his position and hiscircumstances. Many of our breth-ren have gone to prison, for the Gos-pel's sake. This has created a degreeof trial, affliction and sorrow in theirfamilies. As a general thing, asBrother George Q. Cannon has said,it has a tendency to draw theirwives and their children closer tothem. Every wife should be kindto her husband. She should com-fort him and do what good she canfor him, under all circumstances inlife. When all the family are unitedtogether, they enjoy a heavenlyspirit here on the earth. This ishow it should be; for when a manin this Church takes unto himself awife he expects to remain with herthrough all time and eternity. Inthe morning of the first resurrectionhe expects to have that wife and hischildren with him in a family or-ganization, to remain in that condi-tion forever and forever. What aglorious thought that is! I have feltif, when I get through this world,where I have passed through manytribulations and afflictions with mywives and children, I can only havethem with me in the next world, intheir immortal bodies, to stand withme in the presence of God and of theSavior, and ofthe patriarchs andprophets, it will pay me for all mylabors if I should live to be as old asMethusaleh. And I have no doubtthat all of you feel the same.There is another thing I wish torefer to here. I have heard that inZion there are some men who enter-tain the idea that they inherit thebody and spirit of Moses, or Abraham (OT)Abra-ham, or David, or Noah, or some-body other than themselves. I hopenone of you here indulge in any-thing of this kind, because it is a 
 remaining, and I this day have beencalled to this responsibility in themidst of my brethren — a responsi-bility that no man can fill unless heis inspired o[f] God.But I will say this to my brethren and sisters, in the name of Israel's God: The Almighty will never per-mit me, nor any other Presidentwho holds the keys of the Kingdomof God, to lead you astray. If I do not walk in the paths of righteous-ness and do what is right in theposition that I occupy, He will re-move me out of my place, or anyother man who attempts to lead thepeople astray. The position which I occupy, and that occupied by mybrethren the Apostles, should not have a tendency, if we have the Spirit of God, to make us lifted upor exalted in our spirits before the Lord.  I know, as the God of Israel lives, that I have no power, norhave I had, in this Church, to perform any work pertaining to thisKingdom until it has been givenunto me by the God of heaven. Iknow Joseph Smith had not, norBrigham Young, nor John Taylor,nor any Apostle or Elder in this Church and Kingdom. And the mo-ment that I attempt to become liftedup in the pride of my heart, becauseof any position that I hold, thatmoment I become a very unwise man. So with anyone else. Thehigher our position the more our re-sponsibility. During the little time I may spend here in the flesh, I stand in need of the prayers of theLatter-day Saints, of those who have faith in God. So do mybrethren that surround me. So doall the authorities of the Church.We all stand in need of the HolyGhost and the power of God. With-out this we are not qualified tofill the positions which we are calledto occupy.I know that this is the work ofGod. So do all you who have everhad the testimony of the Holy Ghost with you. The God of heaven has set His hand to establish His Kingdom, in fulfillment of the revelations of heaven which He has inspired men to declare and put on record from generation to gener-ation. His hand has been manifest from the beginning of the workuntil the present day. It will beuntil this scene is wound up. Ihave a great desire that, as a peo-ple, we may be united in heart; thatwe may have faith in the revela-tions of God, and look to those hings which have been promised unto us. We should be hum-ble before the Lord.  Trace the history of Jesus Christ, the Savior ofthe world, from the manger to thecross, onward through sufferings, mingled with blood, to the throneof grace, and there is an ensamplefor the Elders of Israel, an ensamplefor all those who follow the Lord Jesus Christ. In meekness and low-liness of heart He labored faithfullywhile He dwelt in the flesh to carryout the will of His Father. God haslaid upon our shoulders and hassealed upon our heads the holy and eternal Priesthood, which is from eternity unto eternity. Withoutthat Priesthood we have no powerto administer in the ordinances ofthe Gospel of Christ, either for theliving or the dead. But with thatPriesthood we have power to per-form the work that is assigned unto s. By that Priesthood we havepreached the Gospel, we have ad-ministered in the ordinances of the House of the Lord, and we havegathered together the sons anddaughters of Zion into these valleysof the mountains.I feel as though I want to bear my testimony to the truth of this good old book, the Bible, for a few min-utes—the book that all the Chris-tian world profess to believe in.There is an effort made today by theinfidel and unbelieving world to ridicule the Bible, as not being theword of the Lord. I will refer to a few things that have been manifes-ted in fulfillment of the record. Tocommence with, I will touch upon the first dealings of God with man. The first son that was begotten byFather Adam, whose name wasCain, proved to be a murderer. Heslew his brother Abel, who held the Priesthood, and the Lord pro-nounced a curse upon him. He showed Cain the position he was in,and told him what the result of hiscrime would be; and Cain said untothe Lord:"My punishment is greater than I can bear."Behold, Thou has driven me out this day from the face of the earth;and from thy face shall I be hid;and I shall be a fugitive and a vag-abond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me."But the Lord said unto him:"Therefore, whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken onhim seven fold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him."What was that mark? It was a mark of blackness. That mark rested upon Cain and descended upon his posterity from that timeuntil the present. Today there aremillions of the descendants of Cain, through the lineage of Ham, in the world, and that mark of darkness still rests upon them. Thoughnearly six thousand years have passed and gone, this mark is visi-ble to the whole human family. Yet the fool and the infidel saythere is no God, and they ridicule the Bible.The Lamanites, on this continent,suffered a similar experience. Theywent to war against the Nephites; they thirsted for blood, and theypainted themselves red; and the Lord put a curse of redness upon them. Hundreds of years havepassed since then, but wherever you meet the Lamanites today, you see that mark upon them.Read the history of ancient na-tions and the dealings of God withthem, as contained in the Bible andother historical works. When those ancient kingdoms and peoples be-came wicked and corrupt, whenthey turned away from all that wasvirtuous and holy, the Lord raised up prophets to warn them; and these prophets, though perhaps unpopu-lar in the eyes of those with whom they dwelt, warned these nationsand cities of the judgments that would overtake them. What fol-lowed the warnings of these proph-ets? Read of the fall of the mightycities of Thebes, Nineveh, Memphis, Tyre and Sidon, Babylon the Great, and Jerusalem itself. All thesegreat and mighty cities and nationswere warned by the servants of God of the judgments that wouldovertake them. Did the inhabitants of those cities believe the words of the prophets? They did not. Butdid those words come to pass? Theydid; and those cities were laid wasteand their inhabitants destroyed.Thus the words of the prophets andinspired men were fulfilled to the very letter, not one jot or tittle fail-ing unfulfilled. And yet the infidel says there is no God. These sameprophets and patriarchs also saw, byvision and revelation, our day; they pointed out the generation in which we live, and they all declared that,in the latter days, the God of heaven would set His hand to gather to-gether His people and establish His kingdom. The Revelator St. John also declared what should come topass in the latter days. In the 14thchapter of Revelation he says:"And I looked, and lo, a Lambstood on the mount Zion, and withHim an hundred forty and four thousand, having His Father's name written in their foreheads.These one hundred and forty-four thousand were sealed out of all the 
 226  THE DESERET WEEKLY.Are we, as parents, doing our duty towards them? Are they trying to qualify themselves and preparingfor the great destiny and workwhich lie before them? I thinkthey are, to a certain extent. But when I see any of these young men going astray and going to thesesaloons, drinking and smoking, instead of going to Sabbath School and to meeting to qualify them-selves, I feel sorry. I would regretto see any son or daughter of mineor of my neighbors going astray,because they would be losing great glory, and depriving themselves ofthe privilege of stepping forth andtaking the place of their fathers andof the prophets and apostles of God,and filling the different quorums ofthe Church. They would be losing that which they do not comprehend. When, however, I hear a testimonylike that given here today concern-ing our young people, it gives me joy and consolation.I feel that it is our duty to do all that we can in behalf of these insti-tutions in our midst. It is the duty of the presidents, the superintend-ents and the teachers to do all they can to influence our sons anddaughters to unite together and toqualify themselves by learning outof good books. They should betaught to seek for the Spirit of God and to treasure up wisdom, and toobtain those principles of powerwhich they will need in the day when the judgments of God shall descend upon the earth. I rejoice when I see our young men andmaidens trying to do their duty. The Lord is raising up young men who are being clothed upon with the Spirit and power of God. I rejoice in this. I am satisfied that theywill increase; but I feel that they should be taught and encouraged toqualify themselves to take theKingdom of God and bear it off.There is a great destiny awaitingour young men. Therefore, theyought to be temperate; not drinkwhiskey, not chew or smoke tobacco,and not mingle with the drunken.And it is the duty of those who are not married to take these daughtersof Zion to wife, when they arrive ata proper age. There are no betterwomen on the face of the earth thanthose that dwell in these mountainsof Israel. If there is any virtue anywhere, it exists among the women that live in Zion. The same with the men. Our young ladies are virtuous; their mothers are virtuous; and their fathers arevirtuous. There may be exceptions; but the Lord has gathered togethera people who are virtuous. My feel-ings are that every young man in Israel should get married when hearrives at a proper age. It does not cost any man more to provide thesegirls with food and clothing after they are married than it does before. Itdoes not cost any more for your-selves. But you are then preparedto begin to gather some meansaround you. Do not wait until youhave about ten thousand dollars and have fine horses and carriages. You will get them just as quickly after youare married, and possibly quicker, than you will before.It is our duty to get married at the proper time. It is the law of God. Therefore, I would like to see you young men take these daugh-ters of Zion to wife. Look at theposterity of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and see how they spread throughout the whole world. Thetribe of Judah has remained untilthis day; but had they not been of the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and had they not been blessed by father Jacob, they would doubtless have been destroyed longbefore this. The Jews put to deaththe Savior and His Apostles, andhad they not been of the chosen seed they would never have been al-lowed to remain on the earth; butthey have remained almost undi-minished, in the midst of all the persecution and tribulation whichthey have had to suffer.These are some of my feelings,brethren and sisters, with regard toour young men and maidens.They occupy a position, asI have often said, that no previous generation ever occu-pied. Many of these young men and maidens that are here today will, in my opinion, if they are faithful, stand in the flesh whenChrist comes in the clouds of heaven. These young people from the Sabbath Schools and from theMutual Improvement Associations, will stand in the flesh while the judgments of the Almighty sweepthe nations of the earth as with abesom of destruction, in fulfillment of the revelations of God, and they will be the very people whom Godwill bless and sustain. Therefore, I say, our young men cannot begin too quickly to qualify themselves bytreasuring up wisdom and calling upon God and getting the Holy Priesthood; for they have got tostand in holy places while thesejudgments are poured out upon theearth. The nations of the earth are rejecting the testimony which webear; they are rejecting the Gospel of Christ; and these judgments of God, like a few drops of rain beforethe shower, are beginning to de-scend upon the earth. We hear offloods, of fires, of earthquakes. These are only the beginning of sorrows. These judgments will increase, andthey will continue to increase until all that has been predicted by the prophets of God will come to passupon the earth.Now, brethren and sisters, we aretrying to prepare ourselves for ex-altation and eternal life. We havereceived the Holy Priesthood. There is no change to that Priest-hood. It belongs to the CelestialKingdom of our God. It does notbelong to the terrestrial nor to thetelestial kingdom. If you and Iever get into the celestial kingdom, we have got to keep the law of that kingdom. Show me the law that aman keeps and I will tell you where he is going. We, as Latter-day Saints, have everything to encour-age us. We have received the Gos-pel of Christ and the blessingsthereof. What did we know in re-gard to God and salvation until theLord revealed Himself? Who ever knew, before the Lord revealed it to us, that a man could have his wives and his children with him inthe morning of the resurrection, inthe family organization, with him-self at the head, to dwell togetherfor ever and ever? I have thought many a time that if I labored untilI was as old as Methuselah and bythat means could have my family dwell with me in glory in the eter-nal worlds, it would pay me for allthe pain and suffering I could en-dure in this world. And this is only one of the blessings that are promised unto us.Our young people should labor to qualify themselves by reading therevelations of God. There is notime to waste in reading novels. Read the Bible, the Book of Mor-mon, the Doctrine and Covenantsand the records which the Lord has given unto us, and treasure up theserevelations and see what the Lordhas promised unto us. We then treasure up something of worth to us. At one of our meetings a short time ago President Cannon read the revelation contained in the Doctrine and Covenants with regard to whatthe Lord said to Orson Hyde, Wm. E. McLellin and other Elders goingout to preach. The Lord said, speak-ing through Joseph Smith:"And whatsoever they shall speakwhen moved upon by the Holy Ghost, shall be scripture, shall bethe will of the Lord, shall be themind of the Lord, shall be the wordof the Lord, shall be the voice ofthe Lord, and the power of God un-to salvation." [##Doctrine and Covenants 68:4##]Why is this? Because the HolyGhost is one of the Godhead, and consequently when a man speaksby the Holy Ghost, it is the word of the Lord. We should seek to ob-tain this Spirit that it may be withus all the time and become a princi-ple of revelation to us. It is theright of every man in the Churchto enjoy the presence of the HolyGhost.Brethren and sisters, we are liv-ing in a fast age, and we have notime to waste. This is a time when the Lord is going to cut His workshort in righteousness. I have a desire that we, as a people, shall un-derstand the position that we occu-py before the Lord. In the 121st section of the Doctrine and Cove-nants, the Lord, in speaking toJoseph Smith while in Liberty Jail, says:"Behold, there are many called,but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen?"Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men, thatthey do not learn this one lesson—"That the rights of the Priesthoodare inseparably connected with thepowers of heaven, and that thepowers of heaven cannot be con-trolled nor handled only upon theprinciples of righteousness." [##Doctrine and Covenants 121:34-36##]In Kirtland, a number of theQuorum of the Twelve Apostlesapostatized. Why did they aposta-tize? Because they forsook the Lord,they stopped praying, they wanted to get rich, they sought for thehonors of men and for the riches ofthe world; and notwithstanding 
 DISCOURSEDelivered by President Wilford Woodruff, at the Quarterly Con-ference of the Salt Lake Stake,Salt Lake City, September 1, 1889. REPORTED BY GEORGE F. GIBBS.I feel thankful that I have theprivilege of assembling in this Tab-ernacle with my friends, the Latter-day Saints, to partake of the Lord'ssupper, the emblems of His bodyand blood, His body which wasbroken for us and His blood whichwas shed for us. I regard this as a great privilege. While meeting with the Saints upon occasions of this kind I often reflect upon theirspiritual condition, and hope and pray that those who of us who are thus favored to commemorate the deathand sufferings of our Lord and Sa-vior by partaking of the Sacrament,may so live that we may be worthy to eat and drink with Him at thegreat marriage supper of the Lamb,in company with the prophets andpatriarchs and Saints of God of form-er and latter days whom the Father hath given unto Him—those who have obeyed the law, received thetruths of the Gospel and kept His commandments.I wish to say to the Latter-day Saints that every man holding the holy Priesthood, every man called to preside over the Church or any branch of it, is dependent upon theLord for His Holy Spirit to guide and sustain him. We have found the exhortation of the Savior to theapostles of His day applicable to ourown labors and experience, whereinHe said, "And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and untomagistrates, and powers, take nothought how or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: for the Holy Ghost shall teach you inthe same hour what ye ought tosay." [##Luke 12:11-12##] We differ from many peoplein this regard. We very often call upon the Elders from among the congregation to come to the standto speak without any preparation. We all, in a measure, occupy this same position before our fellow men.I never know when appearing before an assembly of the Saintswhat I may say to them; I leaveentirely all these matters with the Lord. If the Lord gives me noth-ing, I shall certainly have but verylittle to say to the people. And this is the position that the Elders are placed in as teachers in Israel. My feelings and views are that the Lord never did have a people fromFather Adam to the present time that were called upon to build upHis Kingdom and establish HisZion in the world, or to preach thegospel of repentance to the childrenof men, but what they were de-pendent entirely upon the God ofheaven for their support.The Lord has told us by revela-tion to speak as we may be movedupon by the Holy Ghost. When a man speaks as he is moved upon bythe Holy Spirit, what he says is theword of the Lord; it is the mind ofthe Lord, it is scripture, it is thewill of the Lord, it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone thatbelieves. Why? Because the Holy Ghost is one of the personages of theGodhead. God the Father and God the Son posess tabernacles, andGod himself has created man afterHis own image; but the Holy Ghostis a personage of Spirit, which bearswitness of the Father and Son untothe children of men.With regard to the rights of the human family I wish to say that God has given unto all of His chil-dren of this dispensation, as He gave unto all of His children ofprevious dispensations, individualagency. This agency has alwaysbeen the heritage of man unto therule and government of God. Hepossessed it in the heaven of heav-ens before the world was, and the Lord maintained and defended it there against the aggression of Lucifer and those that took sideswith him, to the overthrow of Lucifer and one-third part of theheavenly hosts. By virtue of this agency you and I and all mankindare made responsible beings, respon-sible for the course we pursue, thelives we live, the deeds we do in thebody. I will repeat here what I haveoften remarked as the words and sentiments of the Prophet Josephwho once declared it in my hearing. Said he, "If I were ruler or emperor of the world, and I had power over the whole human family, I would make every man, woman and child free in the enjoyment of his or her religion, be that religion whateverit may." These are my sentiments. All people under heaven by virtue of their agency, whether living un-der a republican, a monarchical orany other form of government, are entitled to religious freedom to wor-ship God according to the dictatesof their own conscience, they beingheld accountable to God alone forthe use they make of their agency.And while we, as a community, accord this right and privilege to man the world over, we claim thesame right ourselves. For we pro-fess to believe in the fullness of theGospel of Jesus Christ which God has revealed through the ministra-tions of angels sent unto the serv-ants of God in the dispensation inwhich we live. It was made knownto John the Revelator and to othersof the Prophets and Apostles thatin the last days, among the many great events which were to take place before the coming of the Sonof Man, the everlasting Gospel would be restored to the earth. Re-ferring to this event the Apostle says: "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, havingthe everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth,and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him: forthe hour of his judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##]As Latter-day Saints we believe thatangels visited Joseph Smith whom God raised up, and delivered unto him the fulness of the Gospel; and that he was ordained under thehands of heavenly messengers whoheld the keys of the Holy Priesthoodand also the Priesthood after the order of Aaron.Nearly sixty years have past and gone since this Church was or-ganized. It has fallen to my lot to be associated with this people for thelast 56 or 57 years of my life. Itraveled with Joseph Smith and theApostles and with many who are now in the spirit world, hundreds and thousands of miles laboring forthe salvation of our fellow men.We are very differently situated to-day from what we were in the earlydays of this Church. We now oc-cupy permanent homes in the val-leys of these Rocky Mountains.I came here with Brigham Young when the country was abarren desert. The record of our lives for the last forty years, duringwhich time we have been here, is before the world as history. The aim and object of our lives today arewhat they were in the beginning, namely the building up of theKingdom of God upon the earth.And I wish to bear my testimony tothe Latter-day Saints and to theworld that this Gospel of the King-dom which the angel of God de-livered unto Joseph Smith will bepreached as a witness to all theworld before the end come. It is thesame Gospel that was preached byChrist and the Apostles, and whichthe Jews rejected. There is but oneGospel plan of salvation, and it is eternal and everlasting in its char-acter; it cannot be perverted or changed with impunity; hence theApostle Paul has said in this con-nection, "Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other Gos-pel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him beaccursed." [##Galatians 1:8##] What was the Gospel taught by Paul, and by Peter,James and John? The first princi-ple of the Gospel they taught was faith in God; the next was repent-ance of sins, and then baptism forthe remission of sins. Jesus Him-self was baptized of John, that hemight fulfil all righteousness, be-cause baptism was a righteous law,and one of the ordinances of the ever-lasting Gospel. At first John de-clined to baptize the Savior, recog-nizing the fact that He was withoutsin, and that baptism was for the re-mission of sin. But Jesus answer-ing said, "Suffer it to be so now: forthus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness." And He baptizedthe Savior and Redeemer of the world. As soon as this ordinancewas attended to the heavens ac-knowledged the act by the manifes-tation of the Holy Ghost. [##Matthew 3:13-17##] And the next ordinance after baptism is thelaying on of hands for the receptionof the Holy Ghost. This was the Gospel taught by the Apostles whilethey lived. The Holy Ghost gaveunto men a testimony that Jesus wasindeed the Christ, the Redeemerof the World; and it was a guide to their feet and a lamp to their path during their whole lives. The Church at first was organized uponthe foundation of Apostles and Prophets, Christ Jesus being thechief corner stone. We are told that Christ has set in the Church, "First apostles, secondarily prophets;" that "He gave some apostles; andsome prophets; and some evan-gelists; and some pastors and teach-ers;" and they were to be standing [##Ephesians 4:11##] 
 514 THE DESERET NEWS. Sept. 15DISCOURSEBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVEREDIn the Salt Lake Assembly Hall, atthe Semi-Annual Conference ofthe Salt Lake Stake of Zion,Saturday Afternoon,3rdJuly, 1880.------------------REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.I HAVE listened to the instructionsgiven here this afaernoon by mybrethren, as well as the remarks of Brother Cannon, this forernoon, withfeelings of a great deal of interest. When we talk of our duties as Latter-day Saints I think many times some of us, perhaps all ofus, more or less, fall short of compre-dending and understanding the re-sponsibilities which we are under to God. I believe there never was a dis-pensation or a generation of men in any age of the world that everhad a greater work to perform, orever were under greater responsibil-ity to God, than the Latter-daySaints. The kingdom of God hasbeen put into our hands. We havebeen raised up as sons and daughters of the Lord to take this kingdom, tolay the foundation of it, to build up-on it, to carry it out in its variousbranches until it becomes perfectedbefore the heavens and before the earth as God has foreordained itshould be. And those principleswhich have been referred to by the brethren in regard to our duties we cannot safely ignore them nor turnaside from them. I will say as one of the quorum of the Twelve Apos-tles, from the time I was first ac-quainted with this organization until to-day we have never felt ourselvesat liberty to stay away from ourmeetings unless we were sick or cir-cumstances hindered us in some way or other. I can say that for myself, and I believe I can say the same for my brethren. We havealways felt duty bound to attend ourmeetings, and if we do not attend the question might arise, what hasbecome of the Twelve Apostles?Where are they that they do not at-tend their meetings? It would be a very proper question to ask. And if this responsibility rests upon us in the capacity which we occupy doesit not rest upon other men? I think it does. I do not believe the Lord ever required Joseph Smith or Brig-ham Young or any of their counselors to undertake to build up this king-dom alone. He never required themto build these temples alone. They were required to perform their duties, that is true.  Joseph Smith was called of God, inspired of God, raisedup of the Lord, ordained of God long before he was born, to stand in theflesh, as much as Jeremiah or any ofthe ancient prophets, to lay the foun-dation of this Church and kingdom.He performed his work faithfully.He labored faithfully while he taber-nacled in the flesh, and sealed his testimony with his blood. Other men were called also to build uponthe foundation which he laid.We have in days that are pastand gone been under the necessityof going forth to preach the gospel inthe world. We have had this to do. We have been called to do it. We have been ordained to do it. Wehave been commanded of God to do it, and so have hundreds and thou-sands of the elders of this Churchand kingdom. We have all someresponsibility, more or less, resting upon us, whether as regards going on missions or anything else. I re-member Brother Joseph Smith vis-ited myself, Brother Taylor, BrotherBrigham Young and several other missionaries, when we were about to take our mission to England. Wewere sick and afflicted many of us. At the same time we felt to go. The Prophet blessed us as also our wives and families; and I was read-ing a day or two ago his instructions from my journal. He taught ussome very important principles, someof which I here name. BrotherTaylor, myself, George A. Smith,John E. Page and others had beencalled to fill the place of those whohad fallen away. Brother Josephlaid before us the cause of those menturning away from the command-ments of God. He hoped we would learn wisdom by what we saw withthe eye and heard with the ear, andand that we would be able to discernthe spirits of other men without be-ing compelled to learn by sad experi-ence. He then remarked that any man, any elder in this Church andkingdom — who pursued a coursewhereby he would ignore or in otherwords refuse to obey any known lawor commandment or duty — when-ever a man did this, neglected anyduty God required at his hand in at-tending meetings, filling missions,or obeying counsel, he laid a founda-tion to lead him to apostasy and this was the reason those men had fellen. They had misused the priesthoodsealed upon their heads. They had neglected to magnify their calling as apostles as elders. They had usedthat priesthood to attempt to build themselves up and to perform someother work besides the building upof the kingdom of God. And not onlydid he give us this counsel, but the same is given in the revelation ofGod to us. I have ever read witha great deal of interest that revelationgiven to Joseph Smith in answer tohis prayer in Liberty jail. I haveever looked upon that revelations ofGod to that man, considering thefew sentences it includes, as contain-ing as much principle as any revela-tion God ever gave to man. He gaveJoseph to understand that he held the priesthood which priesthood was after the order of God, after the or-der of Melchisedec, the same priest-hood by which God himself per-formed all his works in the heavens and in the earth, and any man who bore that priesthood had the same power. That priesthood had com-munication with the heavens, powerto move the heavens, power to per-from the work of the heavens, and wherever any man magnified that calling, God gave his angels charge concerning him and his ministrationswere of power and force both in thisworld and the world to come; butlet that man use that priesthood for any other purpose than the buildingup of the kingdom of God, for which purpose it was given, and the heavens withdr[a]w themselves, the power of the priesthood departs, and he is left to walk in darkness and not in light, and this is the key to apostasy of all men whether in this generation orany other.Our responsibilities before the Lord are great. We have no right tobreak any law that God has givenunto us. The more we do so the less power we have before God, before heaven and before the earth, andthe nearer we live to God, the closerwe obey his laws and keep his com-mandments, the more power wewill have, and the greater will beour desire for the building up of thekingdom of God while we dwell herein the flesh.We have no right to break the Sab-bath. We have no right to neglectour meetings to attend to our labors. I do not believe there was any manever belonged to this Church andkingdom since its organization hasever made anything by going to at-tending to his farm on the Sabbath: butif your ox falls into a pit get him out; work in that way is all just and right,but for us to go farming to the neg-lect of our meetings and other dutiesdevolving upon us is something we have no right to do. The Spirit of God does not like it, it withdraws itself from us, and we make no moneyby it. We should keep the Sabbath holy. We should attend our meet-ings.This kingdom is advancing. It has got to advance, and somebodyhas got to build it up. Somebodyhas got to labor in it. The God of heaven has had a people preparedbefore the world was made for this dispensation. He had a people pre-pared to stand in the flesh to takethis kingdom and bear it off, and thevery spirit of the prophets and apos-tles who have gone before us has been manifested in the lives of faith-ful men and women from the organ-ization of this Church until to-dayand will continue until the comingof the Lord, as there are a greatmany men and women who will live their religion and carry out the pur-poses of God on the earth.It is our duty as apostles, as eld-ers and as Latter-day Saints, to con-template, to reflect, to read the word of God, and try to comprehend ourcondition, our position, and our re-sponsibility before the Lord. If oureyes were opened, if the vail werelifted, and we should see our con-dition, our responsibility, if we couldcomprehend the feelings of God our heavenly Father and the heavenlyhosts and the justified spirits madeperfect in their watch-care over us, in their anxiety about us in our lab-ors here while we are in the flesh, we would all feel that we have notime to waste in folly or anything which brings to pass no good. All of us as elders of Israel and as Latter-day Saints bear some portion of theholy priesthood, either the Melchis-edec or Aaronic. It is a kingdom of priests, and there is work enough for this people to magnify their calling. The Lord has agreed to sustain us,and to break every weapon that is formed against us. He has promisedto sustain Zion, and when the Pro-phet saw this Zion of God in themountains his soul was filled withjoy and he cried, "sing, O heavens;and be joyful, O earth; and breakforth into singing, O mountains; forthe Lord hath comforted his people,and will have mercy upon his af-f[l]icted." Again the Prophet says, "Can a woman forget her suckingchild, that she should not have com-passion on the son of her womb,—yeathey may forget, yet will I not forgetthee." Zion has been before the face of the Lord since the creation ofthe world! Our heavenly Fatherhas protected this people. We havebeen favored from the day we setour feet in the valleys of the moun-tains notwithstanding the tribulation and opposition we have had to con-tend with. All the designs of the wicked and ungodly to stop thiswork have been thwarted. The handof God is over Zion. He is our com-forter. He sustains us, and we haveevery encouragement on the face ofthe earth as Latter-day Saints to betrue and faithful unto him the littletime we spend in the flesh.Our responsibilities are great, ourwork is great. We not only have the gospel to preach to the nations of the earth, but we have to fill thesevalleys, towns, cities &c., and wehave, among other important things,to rear those temples unto the nameof the Lord before the coming ofChrist. We have got to enter intothose temples and redeem our dead—not only the dead of our own family but the dead of the whole spiritworld. This is part of the great work of the Latter-day Saints. Weshall build these temples and if we do our duty there is no power can hinder this work, because the Lord is with us. And certainly our aim is high. As a people we aim at cel-estial glory, we aim at the kingdom of God. We have been raised up for this purpose to warn the world,to preach the gospel, to go to themeek of the earth and bring them to these valleys of the mountains, thatthey may be delivered from thepower of sin and Satan. Our num-bers are many compared with formerdispensations. Nevertheless, our nu-mbers are few when compared withthe twelve or fourteen hundred mil-lions of inhabitants who dwell in the flesh. Still with the help of God,we have power to redeem the world. This is our work. We are obliged to labor and to continue to while weare here, and when we have finishedour work our sons the rising genera-tion, have got to take this kingdom and bear it off.Eight of the quorum of the TwelveApostles are in the spirit world to-day who were in the flesh when we came here, and so they pass away oneafter another, when they finishedtheir work. Do you suppose that intheir minds and feelings they re-alized they had done too much? Ithink not. Just so with those whoremain in the flesh. There is no time to throw away, and I would toGod that the elders of Israel couldfully realize and compreehnd thegreat work that God has put upontheir shoulders—the building up of the kingdom.This kingdom has continued to in-crease and spread. When we came here 33 years ago we found this place a barren desert. There was no markof the white man here. It was a desert indeed, hardly a green thing to meet the eye. You can see to-dayfor yourselves. The inhabitants ofZion are a marvel and a wonder to the world. They occupy these val-leys of the mountains from Idahoto Arizona. The valleys, as it were, are filled with Latter-day Saints. And who are these Latter-day Saints? They are the people whom the God of heaven has raised up infulfilment of promise and revelation. He has carefully gathered them to-gether by the power of the gospel, bythe power of revelation and placedthem here in the valleys of themountains. Has there ever beenany power formed against this peo-ple that has been successful? Nay;and this people will never see theday when our enemies shall prevail,for the very reason that God had de-creed that Zion shall be built up,the kingdom that Daniel saw shallroll forth, until the little stone cut out of the mountain without handsshall fill the whole earth. Thepeople of God shall be prepared inthe latter-days to carry out the greatprogramme of the Almighty, andall the powers of the earth and hellcombined cannot prevent them. When I see the view that the worldtake in regard to this great latter-daywork; when I hear it questioned asto whether God has anything to dowith it; when I see the feeling ofhatred that is manifested towards us, to me it is the strongest evidencethat this is the work of God. Why?Because we have been chosen out ofthe world and therefore the world hate us. This is a testimony thatJew and Gentile and the whole world look at. Then if this is the work of God what is the world going to doabout it? What can this nation or thecombined nations of the earth doabout it? Can any power beneath the heavens stay the progress of thework of God? I tell you nay, it can-not be done. I do not boast of thesethings as the work of man; it is thework of the Almighty; it is not the work of man. The Lord has calledmen to labor in his kingdom, and I wish the elders would look upon this subject as it is and realize our pos-ition before the Lord. Here we are a handful of people chosen out ofsome twelve or fourteen hundredmillions of people; and my faith in regard to this matter is that before we were born, before Joseph Smithwas born, before Brigham was born—my faith is that we were chosen to come forth in this day and genera-tion and do the work which Godhas designed should be done. Thatis my view in regard to the Latter-day Saints, and that is the reasonwhy the apostles and elders in theearly days of this Church had powerto go forth without purse or scripand preach the gospel of Christ andbear record of his kingdom. Had itnot been for that power we couldnot have performed the work. Wehave had to be sustained by thehand of God until to-day, and weshall be sustained until we get th[r]ough, if we keep the command-ments of God, and if we do not weshall fall, and the Lord will raise upother men to take our place. There-fore, I look upon it that we had awork assigned to us before we were born. With regard to the faithfulleaders of this Church and kingdom,beginning with Joseph Smith, howmany times have I heard men sayin my travels—Why did God chooseJoseph Smith, why did he choosethat boy to open up this dispensationand lay the foundation of thisChurch? why didn't he choose somegreat man, such as Henry WardBeecher? I have had but one an-swer in my life to give to such a ques-tion, namely, that the Lord Almigh-ty could not do anything with them,he could not humble them. Theywere not the class of men that were chosen for a work of this kind in anyage of the world. The Lord Al-mighty chose the weak things of thisworld. He could handle them. He therefore chose Joseph Smith be-cause he was weak, and he had sense enough to know it. He hadthe ministration of angels out of heaven. He had also the ministra-tion of the Father and the Son, andof the holy men who once dweltin the flesh.We have been obliged to acknowl-edge the hand of God. From out of the pit have we been dug. We havebeen taken from the plough, the bench, the various occupations oflife, having limited knowledge ofwhat the world calls learning. TheLord has called this class of men aselders, and inspired by the power ofGod they have gone forth and warn-ed the world, and those of this gen-eration who reject the testimony ofthese elders will be under condem-nation, for the elders will rise up injudgment and condemn them. Thebuilding up of this kingdom restsupon our shoulders—not upon theshoulders of Brother Taylor and the Twelve Apostles alone, but everyman and every woman who hasheard this gospel and gone into thewaters of baptism will be held re-sponsible for the light and knowledgethey received.This is my testimony to you to-day. You have got the kingdom of God here. It has grown and in-creased, and will continue to growand increase. I look at this building;I look at the tabernacle here; I look at the temples that are being built;I see what is going on in the moun-tains of Israel, and I ask what is it?It is the work of God. I acknowledgehis hand in it. This is the reason why we are inspired to build these temples. Why we labor to build them is because the day has comewhen they are needed. JosephSmith went into the spirit world tounlock the prison doors in this dis-pensation or generation. He stayedhere long enough to lay the founda-tion of this kingdom and obtain thekeys belonging to it. The last time he ever met with the quorum of the Twelve was when he gave themtheir endowments, and when theyleft him he had a presentiment thatit was the last time they would ever meet. He had something to do theother side of the vail. He had athousand to preach to there whereyou and I have one in the flesh. And this is the great work of thelast dispensation—the redemption of the living and the dead.We ought not, as elders of Israel, to treat lightly the blessings we enjoy. We ought not to treat lightly theholy priesthood, or attempt to use itfor any other purpose under the whole heavens other than to buildup the Zion of God. The counselthat has been given this forenoonupon this matter we should lay to heart. The eyes of all the heavenlyhosts are over this people. Theyare watching us with the deepest anxiety. They understand thingsbetter than we do, for our vail is ourbodies, and when our spirits leavethem we will not have a great way to get into the spirit world. Theyknow the warfare we have withwicked spirits and with a wicked world, but what encouragement wehave when we read the revelations!We live in a generation when the Lord has decreed that his kingdomshall be preserved. The prophets ofevery other dispensation have beencalled to seal their testimony with their blood. My faith is that those of this dispensation will not be called to do this. Joseph and Hyrum, itis true, were called to lay down theirlives. Why? I believe myself itwas necessary to seal a dispensationof this almighty magnitude withthe blood of the testator for onething, and for another thing thepeople were worthy that put him todeath, and will have the bill to pay as the Jews had to pay for the blood of the Messiah; but as far as theleaders of this people and the peoplegenerally are concerned, I think theLord intends we should live at peace. With regards to Brigham Young, weall know the disposition there wason the part of his enemies to take his life. I never believed, however, that he would die a violent death.Neither do I believe that we shall be required to go forth and stain ourswords in the blood of our fellowmen in our defense. It has been decreed that the wicked shall slay the wicked. Now, I give you myviews regarding these things. Ispeak the sentiments of my ownheart and what I believe. The judg-ments of our God will be pouredforth, but the elders of Israel willnot be called upon to slay the wicked.The wicked will slay the wicked. When I read the Bible, the Book ofMormon and the Book of Doctrineand Covenants, I feel that it is withus as with the generation that livedin the days of Ezekiel. In those days the Lord told the prophet to tell the people that what he said hemeant to fulfil. And so it is in the day and age in which we live. All things will be fulfilled. The judg-ments of Almighty God will bepoured out upon the wicked. Theharvest is ripe, and I know the farmer has got to cut his crops whenthey are ripe, otherwise they will goback into the ground and rot.When I see the wickedness andabomination that prevail in Babylon,covering the earth, as it were, like a mighty sea—when I see these thingsI feel to ask myself the question, how long can these sins rise up inthe sight of heaven and not have their reward? In my own mind Ican see a change at our door. Inthe face of the revelations I cannotsee how it can be otherwise. Thesigns of heaven and earth all indi-cate the near coming of the Son of Man. You read the 9th, 10th and11th chapters of the last Book ofNephi, and see what the Lord hassaid will take place in this genera-tion, when the gospel of Christ hasagain been offered to the inhabitantsof the earth. The Lord did not re-veal the day of the coming of theSon of Man, but he revealed thegeneration. That generation is upon us. The signs of heaven and earthpredict the fulfillment of these things,and they will come to pass.Therefore, let us try to live our re-ligion. We have the kingdom of God. There is no question aboutthis. There was none with Joseph Smith when the angels of God min-istered unto him, and we had a liv-ing testimony of this work from thatday to this. What is the greatest testimony any man or woman canhave as to this being the work of God? I will tell you what is the greatest testimony I have ever had,the most sure testimony, that is thetestimony of the Holy Ghost, the testimony of the Father and theSon. We may have the ministrationof angels; we may be wrapt in the visions of heaven—these things as testimonies are very good, but when you receive the Holy Ghost, whenyou receive the testimony of the Father and the Son, it is a true prin-ciple to every man on earth, it de-ceives no man, and by that princi- 
 AN ADDRESS to the officers and members of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:Dear Brethren and Sisters—It has been a practice in the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints, sanctioned by the word of the Lord, to fast and pray, and in this manner to seek forthat faith which Saints should possess, and obtain that spirit of humility which we are commanded to cultivate.Shortly after the arrival of the peoplein the valley of the Great Salt Lake,the first Thursday in each month wasset apart as a day of fasting and prayer. The members of the Churchwere enjoined to bring on that day their contributions for the relief and sustenance of the poor, and hand themto the Bishop of the ward.At the time of the adoption of this regulation it was very convenient forthe people generally to meet together in their places of worship on that day. The conditions were such that they,being of one faith, employers and em-ployed, could leave their labor anddevote a few hours tothe Lord.For many years these meetings werewell attended, and they were of a most interesting character, and were a comfort and a strength to all who shared in them, as it was the practicefor persons of both sexes to bear their testimony and take active part in them in each ward under the direction of thebishopric.As the years rolled by, conditionschanged, and it became more difficult for the people generally, and especially those in steady employment, to attend these meetings, until at the present time they have dwindled to such an extent that comparatively few have theopportunity of attending them. Thurs-day as a day of fasting and prayer in the Church no longer serves the object for which it was intended.Our attention has been called to thissubject, and after mature deliberation, it has been decided to change the day that has heretofore been devoted tothis purpose. Instead of the custom-ary assemblages in the various wardsthroughout Zion on the first Thursdayin each month, we have concluded toset apart the first Sunday in every month as the day for the regular fast meeting.Hereafter, therefore, we desire theLatter-day Saints, under the direction of the Presidents of Stakes and theBishops, to meet in their several places of worship on the afternoon of the firstSunday in each month, whenever it can be done conveniently, and devote the meeting to the administration of the Sacrament, to the bearing of testi-mony by the members of the Church,to the blessing of children and the con-firming of members in the Church,and to such other services as haveusually been attended to at such meet-ings. We feel assured that excellent re-sults will follow the giving of members of the Church an opportunity to beartheir testimony to each other and toseek for the gifts which the Lord haspromised to those who keep His com-mandments.Care should also be taken on such occasions to see that the wants of thepoor are relieved by the contributionsof the Saints in their behalf, that no cry of the indigent or suffering shall arise from our land in the ears of theLord of Sabaoth.In Salt Lake City, instead of thepeople meeting in the Tabernacle onthe afternoon of the first Sunday in each month, we have concluded that itwill be better for that service to be dispensed with, and for the Latter-day Saints to meet in their several wardson that afternoon, so as to give all the members of the ward, including the aged and infirm, and others who are unable to go to the Tabernacle, an op-portunity to participate in the fast meeting and share in the blessings of the occasion. In other Stakes where general meetings are held as in this city, we suggest that they also be dis-pensed with on the first Sunday of each month, and that the Saints meetin their places of worship in the sev-eral wards.In some places the custom has arisen to consider it a fast to omit eatingbreakfast. This is not in accordance with the views and practice of the past. When fasts were observed in the early days, it was the rule to notpartake of food from the previousday until after the meeting in the afternoon of the fast day. In making donations to the poor also it has beenthe understanding that the food that would be necessary for the two meals should be donated to the poor, and asmuch more as those who are liberallyinclined and have the means may feeldisposed to give.In giving this counsel to the Church upon this subject, we include all the missions where the Elders are laboring, either in the United Statesor in foreign lands. We think this arrangement will suit theconvenience and circumstances ofall the Latter-day Saints throughout the world, and we would like it to beobserved by all the organized branchesof the Church in every land, so that our fasting and praying may be uni-form and the time be understood byall.Before closing this address to theSaints, we feel led to say thatif there should be sickness or anyevil resting upon or threateningthe people, these meetings furnish an excellent opportunity to bring such afflictions and troubles before the Lord. By approaching Him in the spirit ofhumility and union, we can suppli-cate Him to remove these afflic-tions or evils from the individualsor from the people. Our past ex-perience has proved to us how will-ing our Father in Heaven is to hear our cries in the hours of extremity and difficulty, when we approach Him in a proper spirit and with proper faith. He isquick to hear the cries of His people,and He has promised to us that if we will draw near unto Him, He will drawnear unto us. Such occasions as these, therefore, ought to be taken advantageof by the afflicted, whether in an in-dividual or in a collective capacity.With constant prayers for your wel-fare and happiness and the prosperityof the work of God,We are your brethren, WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEORGE Q. CANNON, JOSEPH F. SMITH,First Presidency. 
 368   THE DESERET WEEKLY:President Woodruff then addressedthe congregation. He said:I want to say to my young brethrenand sisters and friends in the Sabbathschools established here in the Rocky mountains, God bless you and I feel to bless you, as far as I have the power. I want to say that this is a scene before me today that has overpowered me—it has overpowered my speech. I would rather not say anything, still I I feel I want to make a few remarks to my friends.I never in my life have been in a similar position to that of today. The scene before me has been a fulfillment to all my prayers from my boyhood up to early man-hood. Eighty years ago I was a littleboy ten years of age attending school the same as you are here in the moun-tains of Israel. I read the New Testa-ment. I read of Jacob, I read of the Apostles and the Prophets. I could not find a man on the face of the earth who taught these principles or be-lieved in them. I prayed to the Godof heaven that I might live to see a Prophet; that I might live to see an Apostle who would say something that would satisfy me like unto the principles I read of in the New Testa-ment.Today I stand in the midst of ten thousand young men and women of Israel—sons and daughters of prophets, patriarchs and men of Israel. Men who hold the Holy Priesthood ap-pointed by God of Israel; appointed in the last days to set up and carry these laws and principles of God into effect.It is these principles that we were to look at in the last days. Now I wantto say to you as the rising generation, I never expected to see a day of this kind in my life, in my early days. I did expect as it was promised to me to see a prophet. I have lived to see him. I have traveled with prophets and patriarchs and sons of God, I have lived to see this body of intelligence of the sons of the living God, who come here to themeetings of Israel.I rejoice in this for I see before me the nature of the Latter-day Saints. We cannot say the Bible is a novel—the Bible that contains revelation. I have passed through the periods of boyhood, early manhood and old age. I cannot expect to tarry a great while longer with youbut I want to give to you a few words of counsel. You occupy a position in the Church and Kingdom of God and have received the power of the Holy Priesthood. The God of Heaven has appointed you and called you forth in this day and generation. I want you to look at this. Young men listen to the counsel of your elder brethren. Live near to God; pray while young;learn to pray; learn to cultivate the Holy Spirit of God; link it to you and it will become a spirit of revela-tion unto you, inasmuch as you nourish it. I feel thankful myself that I have lived to see this day. I declare unto you that there are many in the flesh who will remain so until the coming of the Son of Man.This is about all I wish to say. I feel thankful to my heavenly Father that I see this scene before us this afternoon; that I see the Gospel mani-festations on the earth. There hasbeen, as it was stated by our brother, two powers, one to destroy me and the other to save me. And God in heavenhas willed to spare me to see this day.He has given me power to reject everytestimony and reject every example that leads to evil. I say to you chil-dren, do not use tobacco, liquor or any of these things that destroy the body and mind, but honor Him and you will have a mission upon your heads that the world know not of. May Godbless you. Amen. 
 most foolish, nonsensical and falsedoctrine. You gaze upon a manwho professes to have inherited thebody or spirit of Moses, or any ofthose I have named, and I thinkyou will conclude that his appear-ance does not indicate that such isthe case; at any rate, it certainly hasnot improved him. Brother Wood-ruff, Brother Cannon, BrotherSmith, Brother Lorenzo Snow, orany of the brethren, will never in-herit anyone's body or spirit buttheir own, in time or in eternity,unless the devil gets into them. Itis Satan who inspires men to believein such absurd things. He delightsin having any of the brethren en-tertain false ideas, no matter whatthey are. I tell you that whoeversees me in time or eternity will seeWilford Woodruff, not Noah, norAbraham, nor Enoch. Every manhas his own identity, and he neverwill lose that identity. Therefore,when you hear such doctrine asthat advanced, do not believe it.There are a good many things Satanwould like us to believe; but wemust guard against these.The Latter-day Saints need in-struction; they need preaching to;and we esteem it a great blessing tobe able to mingle with you, to speakto you and to bear our testimony un-to you. I say to the Latter-daySaints that the visions of our mindsare open, the revelations of Godrest upon us, and the voice of Godto us is that the day has come whenwe, as shepherds in Israel, holdingthe Apostleship and keys of thekingdom of God, should stand in themidst of this people and call them torepentance, call them to open theireyes to see, and their ears to hear,and to prepare themselves for thegreat events the God of Israel isabout to bring to pass in the earth.We live in a very important day.Father Adam, three years previousto his death, called his sons together—Seth, Enos, Jared, Canaan, Ma-ha'aleel, Enoch and Methusaleh,with the residue of his posterity—into the valley of Adam-Ondi-Ahman, and there heblessed his posterity. The powerof God rested upon him andhe told the people what should be-fall them until the latest generation. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53-56##]These things are all written in theBook of Enoch, which will be re-vealed in the due time of theLord. Since then there have beenEnoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac andJacob, and other patriarchs andprophets. All of them saw, by vi-sion and revelation, this day andthis people. They proclaimed ourhistory from the beginning to theend. Where are these men today?They stand, in their immortalbodies, in the presence of God andthe Lamb. They are watching overus. We are their children and weare fulfilling the mission of the lastdispensation of the fulness of times.I feel sometimes to ask, where arethe hearts and feelings of the peoplewho have embraced this work? Itis a glorious work, a grand work.The Prophet Isaiah, in speaking ofZion, says:"Arise, shine; for thy light iscome, and the glory of the Lord isrisen upon thee. * * *And the Gentiles shall come to thylight, and kings to the brightness ofthy rising." [##Isaiah 60:1-3##]One hundred and fifty thousandof those Gentiles that Isaiah sawhave gathered to these valleys of themountains, in obedience to the Gos-pel of Christ. Is not that Gospelas true today as it ever was? Arenot the revelations of the Almightyas true today as they were in thedays of Adam, and Enoch, andMoses, and Christ and His Apostles?They are. And we have beenreserved in the spirit world forthousands of years, to stand inthe flesh in the latter days, and totake God's kingdom and build it up.Understanding these things then,what are we, as Latter-day Saints,thinking about? We have got agreat warfare to fight. Lucifer, theson of the morning, and all hishosts, are united against us. Weare but a little handful, comparedwith the inhabitants of the earth.There never were but few men andwomen, in any age of the world, whowere independent enough to rejectevil and to serve the Lord. But wehave been counted worthy to benumbered as His people. It is time,therefore, that we arose, that weawoke, and that, clothed upon withthe power of God and the HolyPriesthood, we should magnify thisPriesthood and obtain the blessingsbelonging thereto. This people havepower to contend with the heavens,and to control the heavens, in ameasure. With this Priesthoodresting upon them, this people havepower that when their prayers shallascend into the ears of the God ofIsrael, they shall be heard and ans-wered upon their heads. Shall wedesert the Lord? Shall we desertHis cause? God forbid. There is nomistake about this work. The Lordis not trifling with us. We havethe same eternal and everlastingPriesthood that God has kept in theheavens for eighteen hundred years.Will you tell me that we have notpower to fulfill the commandmentsof God? If you do, you tell methat which is not true. The Godof heaven has given us all needfulpower, if we will only rise up andmagnify it before the heavens andthe earth. We have no time tocontend or quarrel over waterditches. We should be united to-gether and magnify our callings be-fore the Lord; for I tell you there isno time to spare. The Almighty isgoing to cut short His work inrighteousness, or no flesh could besaved. The heavens are full ofjudgments, and all those who re-main in Babylon, God will notspare; they will be burned with thewicked. We are responsible for theuse which we make of the powerGod has given us. I tell you thedevil has no power, the Gentileshave no power over the Latter-daySaints when they do their duty andare united. It is not ordained for thewicked to have power to bring topass evil upon us, if we are united.Zion shall not be moved out of herplace, saith the Lord. But the dayhas come when the Lord calls uponZion to arise, and upon these Apos-tles and these Elders of Israel tofeed the flock of Christ. We shouldteach them the words of life andsalvation, and the Latter-day Saintsshould hear us and lay these thingsto heart. They should fulfil thecommandments of God. We arehere only upon a short mission. Weare the messengers of the God ofIsrael, messengers of life and salva-tion. And if we will do our dutyand obey the commandments ofGod, we shall accomplish all thatthe Lord expects us to do.Brethren and sisters, do notquarrel one with another; do notcontend about water or anything ofthat kind. I tell you that the man who, rather than quarrel with hisneighbor, will say, "Take my water;I won't contend with you," thatman will get a good deal morewheat than the one who fights andquarrels and goes to law about hiswater. He will be blessed of theLord and justified before Him. Letus put all these things aside and callupon the Lord in mighty prayer,asking that His blessings may beupon us, and that His revelationsmay be fulfilled upon our heads;that Zion may be purified and theSaints of God be united together.This is the way we, as the Presi-dency of the Church and as Apostles,feel. I want you to understand thatGod is with us, that the keys of theKingdom of God are here, and thatZion is here, and they have allcome to stay. I rejoice in this; Irejoice in the Gospel of Christ, inwhich there is no change frometernity to eternity.Brethren and sisters, let us try tolive our religion and sanctify our-selves before the Lord. Seek for theHoly Spirit; pray for it; and laborfor visions, for dreams, for revela-tions and for the gifts of the Gospelof Christ, that they may strengthenus in the good work. I pray God tobless you and those who presideover you, as well as those who laborin this Temple in Manti, and in allother Temples in Zion. They areperforming a glorious work in theseTemples. And when we get throughour work here, I trust we will betogether in the Kingdom of God onthe other side of the veil. This ismy prayer and desire, in the nameof Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 84and I now take the liberty, throughthe channel of the press, to invite allin that region of country, and in allother places, into whose hands theselines may fall, that have not alreadyobeyed the fulness of the gospel ofJesus Christ, to repent of all theirsins, and be baptized in water for theremission of their sins, that they mayreceive the gift of the Holy Ghostby the laying on of hands,--that theymay have upon them the weddinggarment, that their lamps may betrimmed and burning, and be pre-pared to go forth and meet the Bride-groom, who is at the door--for the day when the Lord Jesus shall cleansethe earth, by the spirit of judgementand the spirit of burning, from sin,wickedness, and pollution, until it be-comes a fit abode for the Saviour todwell upon, and reign one thousandyears with his saints.W. WOODRUFF.Manchester, July 9th 1840MINUTES OF THE CONFERENCEHELD AT THEGADFIELD ELM CHAPEL, IN WORCESTERSHIRE, ENGLAND,JUNE 14TH 1840.The Preachers and Members of the Bran Green and Gadfield Elm Branchof the Froome Hill Circuit of the United Brethren met at the Gadfield ElmChapel, Worcestershire, June 14th, 1840, pursuant to previous notice, whenthe meeting was called to order by Elder Thomas Kington.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  227they were Apostles their power fell from them. If a man wishes to keep faithful, he has got to live near unto the Lord, remember his prayers, and realize that he is at work for the Lord and for His Kingdom.I thank God that you are united here. I hope you will continue to be so. Do not quarrel over any-thing. It makes me sorrowful when I hear of men holding the Priest-hood wanting to go to law because they have not got sufficient water. This is wrong. It is against the law of God. When we are united we have power with God and with each other. I hope and pray that we may so live in these valleys of the mountains that every operation against us may come to naught, and it will if we do our duty. I do not pretend to know how many tribula-tions or how much suffering we shall yet have to endure before Zion is established in her beauty and glory; but I do know that Zion is not going to be moved out of her place. The Lord, however, will chastise us until we become purified before Him. He will plead with His strong ones, and what He has said concerning Zion will come to pass. I hope that we may exercise wisdom in all things, that we may escape these afflictions.Let us try to live our religion and to do right the few days we have to spend on the earth. Some of us have not got a great deal of time to spend here. We shall soon pass away. Therefore, let us be united together and all will be well. Then when we get through here we may associate on the other side of the veil with those that we have asso-ciated with here on the earth and with the Patriarchs and Prophets that have gone before. The bless-ings of God will attend Zion, and His judgments will rest upon the wicked.I pray God that the union you have here may increase, and that our young men will rise up and magnify their callings beforethe Lord, and treasure up wisdom,knowledge and understanding, and learn those things that will assist them in their duties; for, as I said before, this Kingdom has got to rest upon the shoulders of the rising generation of the Latter-day Saints. This is the destiny to which they are approaching. I feel thankful that I have had this privilege of meeting with you and of listening to what has been said. I pray God to bless you, and those who preside over you, that you may be of oneheart and one mind, and be prepared to inherit eternal life. Amen 
 twelve tribes of Israel, because they were righteous in the latterdays.Following this, John says:"And I saw another angel fly inthe midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach untothem that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, andtongue, and people,"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for thehour of his judgment is come."Again, John says:"And there followed anotherangel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wineof the wrath of her fornication.Following this, he speaks of thereaping down of the earth and ofthe judgments of God which wereto come upon the inhabitants thereof.In fulfillment of the declarationof St. John, the angel of God hasflown through the midst of heaven.He has delivered the Gospel of JesusChrist to the inhabitants of theearth, and revealed unto them theword of the Lord. The HolyPriesthood has also been restored.This Gospel was to be preached "toevery nation, and kindred, andtongue, and people." It has nowbeen preached almost sixty years —from the organization of the Churchuntil today; and in fulfillment ofthe revelations of these inspired Prophets and Apostles, a multitudeof people are today gathered to-gether in these valleys of the moun-tains. In fulfillment of those reve-lations I stand today in this Taber-nacle, which the prophet saw wasto be built upon the tops of the mountains, as a covering from theheat and the storm. In this Taber-nacle today, also, are ten thousandLatter-day Saints, which is a wit-ness to Jew and Gentile of the ful-fillment of the promises of God. Yet the infidel says, "Behold, there is no God." The man who says thereis no God is a fool. We are here infulfillment of prophesy and revela-tion. We have received the Gospelof Christ. The Kingdom of God has been organized. It is rolling on;and it will continue to roll on until this scene is wound up.Now, I want to give a little ex-hortation to my brethren. Brother George Q. Cannon touched upon a very important principle this fore-noon — a principle which has often rested upon my mind; that is, with regard to the spirits that surround us. He said that one-third of thehosts of heaven were cast out be-cause of their rebellion. I suppose we may say that at least one hun-dred thousand millions were cast down from heaven to earth. Whereare they? Some are in Salt Lake, some in New York, some in Am-sterdam, some in Constantinople,some in Jerusalem; in fact, they arein every city and hamlet wherein the inhabitants of the earth dwell, and especially where there are anyLatter-day Saints. And whetherthere are one hundred or not to every man, woman and child, there are enough of them, at least, tolabor for our overthrow. I say to my Counselors, to the Apostles, tothe Seventies, the High Priests,the Bishops, and all men who bear the Holy Priesthood, do you sup-pose these devils are around uswithout trying to do something? Are they asleep? Have they not a work to perform? I say to my brethren who bear the Priesthood,we have got a mighty warfare towage with these spirits. Wecannot escape it. What will they do to you? They will try tomake us do anything and every-thing that is not right. These devils would be very glad to makeme and my brethren think we aregreat men, smarter than any one else; to divide us one against theother, and to cause us to seek toconfess our brother's sins instead of our own. We should therefore watch ourselves well. I should do this; my Councilors and the Apostlesshould; we all should. And unless we are united together, as has been said before, we are not the Lord's.But today we have certainly mani-fested a union here that the worldis not acquainted with.  We have, however, a mighty responsibility resting upon us. The eyes of allthe heavenly hosts are upon us.The eyes of Father Adam, and thepatriarchs and prophets, both an-cient and modern, who havegone to the other side of the veil, are over us. And if our eyes are opened to comprehend the things of God, we can comprehend our re-sponsibilities; we can comprehend the powers of the Holy Priesthoodand the relationship which we sus-tain to God. We certainly shouldhumble ourselves before the Lord.We should labor with all our might to build up the Kingdom of God inwhat little time we have to spendhere in the flesh. Our aim is high. We aim at eternal life; we aim at immortal glory; we aim at a placein the celestial Kingdom of our God, with God and Christ and those whohave kept the celestial law. In order to get there, we have got to keep the same law that has exalted those who have gone before us.This is not our home. We were kept in the spirit world until thisgeneration, and have been brought forth, through the loins of Joseph and Ephraim, to stand in the flesh and to bear off the Kingdom, to hold the Holy Priesthood, to do the works of righteousness, to buildtemples, to redeem our dead, and toattend to those ordinances which theGod of heaven has declared we shall perform. This is our work. We have a long eternity before us. Butall of us will have to meet at thebar of God — the righteous and thewicked, those who are living and those who are dead.This is the condition of the Lat-ter-day Saints. I hope that we mayescape the power of the enemy.  As was said here this forenoon, it mat-ters but very little what may takeplace outside of Zion, or outside of the Kingdom of God. The God ofIsrael holds the destiny of this na-tion; He holds the destiny of this people, and of all men on the face of the earth. They are at His com-mand and in His power. He will hold this nation, as He did Jerusa-lem, responsible for the course theypursue with regard to the Latter-day Saints. We also will be held responsible for the course we pursue. The Lord has led this Church from its organization until the present day. He will lead it until the com-ing of the Son of Man. He is notgoing to desert His people nor His cause. But it is our duty to pleadwith the Lord, remember our pray-ers, keep our covenants, and walk perpetually before Him, that we may have His favor and blessingresting upon us.I wish to say with regard to the rising generation — the sons anddaughters of the Latter-day Saints— that they should take the counselof their fathers; they should honortheir parents, and honor God, andreceive such counsel as is given un-to them by wise men. I thinkmany times that our children do notcomprehend the position they oc-cupy. They do not comprehendwhat lies before them. Their fathers are passing away. Yet this King-dom has got to remain on the earthuntil the coming of the Son of Man. This work has got to follow theirfathers; it has got to rest upon thesons and daughters of Zion. I havea great desire that the institu-tions which have been organized inZion for their welfare may be blessed; that our sons and daughtersmay attend the Primaries, the Sab-bath Schools and Mutual Improve- 
 ministers to the Church "for theperfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of thebody of Christ till we all come inthe unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, into a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of fullness of Christ." [##Ephesians 4:12-13##]The Lord required Joseph Smith toorganize the Church of Christ afterthis order. He did so, and this Church has remained intact in itsorganization from that day to the present; and it will continue toremain until the coming of the Sonof Man. And I would say here that there is no change of the Gos-pel of Christ in this, neither has there been in any other age of the world. There never has been any change from eternity to eternity,neither has there been any change of the ordinances, or of the Holy Priesthood; they are the same "yes-terday, today and forever." [##Hebrews 13:8##]I will also make a remark with regard to our views of the Priest-hood. Jesus Christ is our High Priest. He held the Priesthood af-ter the order of Melchisedec, which is without beginning of days or end of years, being from eternity to eternity. We have been informed that Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuse-lah, Lamech, and Noah, were all High Priests. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] In all the dispensa-tions whenever God has had a peo-ple upon the earth, no man has ever been called to administer in any of the ordinances of the Gospel except by and through the eternal and everlasting Priesthood. We cannot learn from the Bible—"the stick of Judah," [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##] the record of the Jews—that God ever called a man to offici-ate in the offering of sacrifices, or to administer in any of the ordinances of the Gospel, ex-cept by and through the Priest-hood. And our belief is that no man has a right to minister in this age in the ordinances of the House of God, except he be duly called and ordained. The Holy Priesthood is the channel through which God communicates and deals withman upon the earth; and the heavenly messengers that havevisited the earth to communicate with man are men who held and honored the Priesthood while in the flesh; and everything that God has caused to be done for the salvation of man, from the coming of man upon the earth to the redemption ofthe world, has been and will be byvirtue of the everlasting Priesthood.Our Elders who are called to bear this Priesthood are being sent abroadto preach the Gospel without purseor script, and they are blessed in their labors. [##Doctrine and Covenants 24:18-19##] Truly has it been said the Lord has called the weak things of the world to confound the wisdom of the wise, and tobring to pass the purposes of God. And they like the servants of the Lord of former days have promisedto all those who obey the Gospelthat they should receive the Holy Ghost. I have often said, and I say again, we might have preachedto the whole world until we had be-come as old as Methuselah if thetestimony of our Elders had notbeen backed up by the gift of theHoly Ghost, Utah would be todayas barren as we found it in 1847; that is, as far as our being here is concerned. It is the Spirit of God, the testimony of Jesus, that hasbeen imparted to the Saints in fulfil-ment of the promise of the Elders who preached the Gospel to them intheir native lands, that has impelledthis people to gather to these valleys of the mountains. And if I were to call upon all those of this con-gregation who have received this testimony to rise to their feet, theLatter-day Saints of this congrega-tion would respond in a body. If the people had not received this testimony they never would haveleft their homes and friends to come here. You knew it was not the work of man, but the work ofGod, and you labored diligently to effect your deliverance from Baby-lon because you were moved uponby the Spirit of God, and you never rested until you emigrated.We are called of God to establish His Zion upon the land of Joseph. You have the Bible, which the Christian world profess to believe in, as well as the Book of Mormon, which you believe in. These rec-ords and revelations of God testify of your day. Isaiah pointed outyour history, your travels in coming to these western valleys, your labors here; and if we had not gatheredhere, much of the Bible prophesieswould have failed in their fulfil-ment. Many say these revelationsare to be spiritually construed, that they are not intended to be under-stood in a literal sense. We view these things differently. We take it what the Lord through His servants has said concerningthis matter means what He has said and said what he means. It is true we have passed through agood deal of persecution; but in this we are no exception to the rest of God's servants and people of otherages. The records that have come to us testify of these things. Oppo-sition to God and His Christ, oppo-sition to light and truth has existedsince the beginning to the present day. This is the warfare that com-menced in heaven, that has existed through all time, and that will con-tinue until the winding up scene, until He reigns whose right it is toreign, when He shall come in cloudsof glory to reward every man ac-cording to the deeds done in the body.We live in a peculiar dispensation—I will say the great and last dispen-sation of God to man. And what is the state of our nation and that ofthe Christian world? Unbelief withregard to the fulfillment of what the prophets have said should takeplace in the last days. I have felt thatthe Lord has become very unpopular in this generation, and that His revelations have become very un-popular. Common schools turn the Bible out of doors. Of course thereis a general profession of faith and belief in God, but a decided unbe-lief exists, and a general indiffer-ence with regard to the fulfillment of the predictions contained in the Bible. A great many too believe when a man dies that is the end ofhim, that there is no hereafter. Can any sensible man believe that the God of heaven has created two or three hundred thousand million spirits, and given them tabernacles, merely to come and live upon the earth and then to pass away into oblivion or to be annihilated? Itseems to me that no reflecting man can entertain such belief. It is con-trary to common sense and to seri-ous reflection. Generation after generation has lived and died,has passed into the spirit world, and we have to a limited extent an account of the doings of God with them. The Prophets, Apostles and Patriarchs have left their inspired writings on record for our use andbenefit, and we shall be held ac-countable in the exercise of our agency for the manner in which we treat the Word of God that has come unto us.I testify that the God of heaven hasset His hand to establish His Kingdom, and to build up His Church and establish His Zion upon the foundation of Prophets and Apostles, Jesus Christ being the chief corner stone. We live in a dispensation different from any other. The dispensation that ush-ered in the Christian era was one of sacrifice. The Savior came andtabernacled in the flesh, and entered upon the duties of the Priesthood at 30 years of age. After laboring three and a half years He was cruci-fied and put to death in fulfillment of certain predictions concerning Him. He laid down His life as a sacrifice for sin, to redeem the world.When men are called upon to repent of their sins, the call has reference to their own individual sins, not to Adam's transgressions. What is called the original sin was atonedfor through the death of Christ irre-spective of any action on the part of man; also man's indi-vidual sin was atoned for by the same sacrifice, but on condition of his obedience to the Gospel plan of salvation when proclaimed in his hearing. This gospel we arecalled to preach to the children of men, calling on them to repent and be baptized for the remission of their sins, and promising them through their obedience and faithfulness the gift of the Holy Ghost, which shall lead and guide them in the ways of all truth and deliver them from darkness and doubt. And the re-sults of the preaching of the serv-ants of God are seen today in what is being done by this people; and itis our duty to continue thiswork, to warn mankind andto gather the Israel of our God. We will be held under con-demnation if we do not do our duty;if we do not warn the nations. Whenever a nation or city hasripened in iniquity, the Lord hasraised up Prophets to warn them of the destruction that awaited them unless they repented. The Lordraised up Noah and commanded him to preach repentance to the peo-ple of his day, and instructed him to build an ark for the salvationof those who should believe on Him. Enoch and his people were peculiar from the rest of the world of his day, and the wicked sought his life; but the power of God was upon him 
 CONFERENCES.The Manchester Conference having been called upon to assemble in the capacity of a special conference, for the purpose of transacting such business as was deemednecessary, I had the happy privilege, in company with elders Hedlock and Ward,of meeting them on Sunday, Feb. 16th, at Mr. Heyward's large and commo-dious room, in Bridge-street, Manchester. The day was exceedingly fine, which caused a vast number of Saints to come in from the various districts until the roomwas crowded to excess.The house was called to order at half-past ten o'clock, A.M., there being presentone of the Twelve, five high priests, thirty elders, thirty-one priests, twenty-twoteachers, and four deacons.Elder Woodruff was called to the chair, accompanied by his counsellors, eldersHedlock and Ward. Conference opened by singing and prayer.The president informed the assembly, that the forepart of the day would bedevoted to teaching and setting forth principles: the afternoon to business: and the evening to preaching, and then called upon elder Hedlock to address the meet-ing, and he did so, much to the edification of the Saints. He spoke of the death of the Prophet and Patriarch, and the additional responsibility and care that was now resting upon the presidency of the churches, in the enlargement and ad-vancement of the church and kingdom of God. He spoke of the persecution and the order of the priesthood, and that the object of the Conference was to make some changes in the Manchester Conference for the advancement of the work in that region. He was followed by elder Ward, who spoke of the great-ness and magnitude of the work, the purity of the principles, and he exhorted theofficers and members to faithfulness. The President closed by bearing his testi-mony to the work, and gave such teaching and advice as was given by the Spirit of God, all of which was received by the Saints with a hearty Amen.The Saints again assembled at two o'clock, P.M. Remarks were made by the President and his Counsellors, concerning the importance of the meeting, and the changes they would recommend in the Manchester Conference. It was then moved by elder Charles Miller, "that elder Milton Holmes be appointed presidingelder over the Manchester Conference; it was seconded and carried without a dis-senting voice.Elder M. Holmes then proposed elder Charles Miller, as his counsellor to assisthim in the conference; it was also seconded and carried unanimously.It was then moved, seconded, and carried unanimously, that elder James D.Ross, from Edinburgh, who was present, should be chosen to preside over theManchester branch; there was not a dissenting voice in any resolution presentedto the conference, but peace, union, and love apparently prevailed with every heart. At the close of the afternoon service, we had the privilege of communing,by partaking of the sacrament with that vast body of the Saints who have fromthe beginning manifested much of a Zion's spirit, and brought forth the fruits ofthe gospel. 
 A SHORT TOUR THROUGH THE CLITHEROE CONFERENCE.On the 4th of May I met with the Saints in Blackburn by request, on the occa-sion of the opening a new room for worship. I addressed them in the morning and evening, and elder Speakman in the afternoon. The room was filled, and we hadan interesting time with the Saints. I found a flourishing branch of the church here; it being also the first time I had ever been privileged with meeting the Saintsin the Clitheroe conference.On the 5th, in company with elder Speakman, I visited the ruins of Whalley Abbey, situated in a most beautiful locality of hills, and woods, and streams. It had originally been very extensive, but ruins alone existed, with the exception of a small portion of building which is occupied by a few families. It appears to have been founded in the year 1000.On the 6th we were favoured with a most interesting visit to Stoneyhurst, a Catholic college, and as I was informed, the most extensive establishment in Eng-land. One large room was splendidly decorated with paintings of great value, by the great masters. The museum did not contain a large collection either of the natural or animal kingdom, yet a number of specimens were rich and costly,especially some small sculptures in marble, of the Saviour, valued at a very highprice.We visited the various apartments of this extensive library, which we foundenriched with most valuable works, many of great antiquity, especially a copy of St. Paul's Epistles, upon parchment, which was said to have been in the hands of the society more than a thousand years; besides it lay Queen Mary's prayer-book, and sundry antique articles.The lodgings, studies, and chapel for the boys, appeared convenient and comfort-able; they have several hundreds passing through a course of education.The principal chapel connected with the college is fitted up in a most costly manner; the organ, altar piece, crosses, candlesticks, &c., were rich indeed, while one window contained a representation of the thirteen apostles (including St. Paul),in stained glass as large as life, got up at a great expense. They have also a beau-tiful garden connected with the establishment, the separate compartments of which are divided by yew-tree fences, about twelve feet high, four feet thick, and fromforty to two hundred feet long, as the case required; I suppose not equalled in extent in England.After leaving the college we travelled to Waddington, a village a short distance from Clitheroe, over the Ribble on the Yorkshire side, where we partook of the hospitality of friend Cottom. While here we visited the alms-house built and dedi-ated by Sir Robert Parker, A.D. 1700, for the poor widows of the parish.On the 7th we walked to Clitheroe and Chatburn, and visited the Saints inthose places. I was much pleased with the meek and quiet spirit manifested amongstthem. I walked through the village of Chatburn, of which elder Kimball speaksin his journal, as walking through it with his head uncovered and blessing the place, while the children had hold of his garments as he passed along. I felt thespirit of God rest upon me while passing through the street where such scenes of interest had transpired with elder Kimball and other servants of God.During our travels on the 8th, we had the pleasure of witnessing fatherRichard Smithies display his skill in beguiling some fine trout from the river Ribble 
 to such an extent that the wickedtrembled at his words, and feared him. At last he and his people weretranslated, were taken from theearth, and the disobedient of his day were left to their own destruction.The same fate befell the Jewish na-tion in consequence of their rejec-tion of the truth, and their treat-ment of those who were sent untothem. They put to death the ser-vants of the Lord and crucified theMessiah. All that had been predict-ed concerning them came literallyto pass. Israel as a nation was over-thrown; their temples destroyed, andthey that escaped death by thesword were taken captive, and thatpeople have been trampled underthe feet of the Gentiles for the past1800 years.Now we understand there is afeeling and spirit working among the Jews to return to the land oftheir fathers to re-build their cityand temple and prepare for the com-ing of Shiloh their King. Andthis will in time be accomplished.We should have faith in God and His promises, and we should readthe revelations that have come untous, and treasure them up. We are all in the hands of God; He holdsour destiny and the destiny of thisnation. All are held by the powerof God. It is for us to understandthe signs of the times, for these things are before us. This is not our work; but if we are true and faithful in this ministry we shall re-ceive our inheritances upon the earthaccording to the promises. Thatour Father may bless us all, and that we may be true and faithful toHim and to one another, laboringwith all our might to build up Zionand to establish His name in honorin the earth, that at last we may re-ceive the reward of the faithful, is my prayer, for Christ's sake. Amen. 
 ment Associations, and unite to-gether in these societies, that they may receive the benefit of the same.Brethren and sisters, God bless you. Let us labor with one heart and one mind, and make our wantsknown unto the Lord. Let ourprayers ascend unto the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth, and they will be heard and answered. I know thatif we are blessed, if we are preserv-ed, and if we are saved, it is andwill be through the mercy and bless-ing of God. I know also that inas-much as we will obey His com-mandments we will receive His protection and blessing. Zion will arise. Zion will be clothed with the glory of God. Zion will be redeemed. Zion will be preparedfor the coming of the Son of Man. The Jews will be gathered home to Jerusalem. And the promises andprophecies concerning both the Jews and the Saints of God will allhave their fulfillment in the earth.My prayer to God is that we may be true and faithful to the end ofour days, and that we may magnify our calling as Apostles, Elders and Saints while we dwell in the flesh. Amen.

 738 THE DESERET NEWS. Dec. 22DISCOURSEBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,Delivered in the Salt Lake AssemblyHall, at the Priesthood Meet-ing, Sunday evening July4th, 1880.REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.As this is the priesthood meeting ofthe elders of Israel and those bearing the priesthood, I feel I would like to say a few words in connection with what Brother Taylor has said. I lookupon our condition or our position, asa people, that we are called to a cer-tain work. When we send men up-on missions or to perform any branchof business or labor, of course we ex-pect them to perform it, and the Lord expects them to do the same. Now I look upon the elders of Israelhere to-night and in this Church and kingdom as upon a mission. We have been ordained to a missionand we have our timeset to do it andto perform it. Not that I know ex-actly how many days or years we are going to spend in it. But this mission is required at our hands, notat the hands of Brother Taylor, Bro-ther Joseph, or Brother Brigham alone, but it is required at our handsby the God of heaven, and we areperforming a work and laying a foun-dation which we have got to meet on the other side of the vail. It doesnot make any difference to what position we are called or ordained.If we are called to the office of abishop we should fulfill the dutiespertaining to that office. I know ithas been considered a very hardoffice and one to which a good dealof time has to be devoted. Yet there are a great many bishops who don'tspend much time in it, while othersare true to their calling. A bishop's calling is an important one. He is called to be a father to the people ofhis ward. And when labor is laidupon us to perform we should notignore that labor or lay it aside.There is an account kept, whetherwe keep one or not. There are a good many revelations which show us that this is the case. Your his-tory goes before you. All of you will find it when you get the otherside of the vail. Every man's his-tory, his acts are written whether he has kept a record here or not. This is plainly manifested in the re-velation known as the "Olive Leaf."As I view it we are not placedhere as elders of Israel, apostles, orbishops, merely to get rich in gold and silver and the things of thisworld. We have a labor laid upon our shoulders. Joseph Smith had, Brigham Young had, the TwelveApostles have, we all have, and we will be condemned if we do not fulfillit. We will find it out when we get to the other side of the vail. It is through this neglect of duty that somany have left this Church and kingdom of God. There is hardly a tithe of the people who have been baptised in water for the remission of sin that have died in the faith. In the United States there are tensof thousands of apostate Mormons.Many a time in my reflections I have wished I could fully compre-hend the responsibility I am under to God, and the responsibility everyman is under who bears the priest-hood in this generation. But I tell you, brethren, I think our hearts are set too much upon the things of this world. We do not appreciate asmen bearing the holy priesthood in this generation should, the mighty responsibility we are under to God and high heaven as well as to the earth. I think we are too far from the Lord. I do not think we liveour religion as we ought to. I donot think our hearts are set upon building up this kingdom as they should be as Latter-day Saints. Now, do not think I am your enemybecause I tell you these things. Ifeel we have an important work to perform, and others will continue the work when we have passed away. I look around and view thework of time. I look around and find that eight of the Twelve Apos-tles have passed into the world of spirits since we came into this valley; I expect to go there myself, I expectmy brethren will, we all shall go there before many years are over. Ido not look for anything else; and I will say that for the last year or two in my reflections I have felt that I have no other business on this earth but to try to build up this kingdom. I do not feel that I am justified in setting my heart upon the things of this world to the neglect of any dutythat God requires at my hands. And another thing when I look at this generation, when I think of thetwelve hundred millions of people who dwell in the flesh, many of them ripening for the judgments of God, a generation that is ready to receive the wrath of God upon their heads—when I consider these thingsI know that if I neglect to bear my testimony before them, if I neglect to bear my tetimony to this genera-tion when I have an opportunity, I shall feel sorry for it when I go into the spirit world. That is the way I feel with regard to this work. God requires that we bear record of it to this generation; and when I think of the extent of this generation, the greatness of it, when I consider thatthis is a generation and dispensation when God has set his hand to es-tablish a kingdom, the great andlast kingdom, and the only kingdom that the Lord ever did establish in any age of the world, to remain on the earth through the millennium, when I think of these things I canrealize the greatness of this work. The Lord never had prophets in anyage of the world who could stand in the flesh and live and build up the kingdom of God. The world has always made war upon them and destroyed them with the exception of Enoch who was taken up to heav-en with his city. Now, if we could realize that we have the kingdom of God upon the earth to-day, with thepromise of God our Father that it will stay upon the earth until thecoming of the Son of Man—if we could realize this and realize our responsibility, it seems tome that we would all have a desire to magnify our calling.As I was going to say with a gen-eration like this, with the nations of the earth as they are to day, having the power to build up the kingdom of God to stay here, having the pow-er to rear temples to the Most High God against the wrath and indigna-tion of a thousand million people—Isay having this power and being sustained by the Lord, we certainly ought to be willing to do our part ofthe work. We have borne testi-mony—I have, my brethren have, the elders of Israel have—to this generation for many years. Wehave borne testimony of the gospelof Jesus Christ, of the Book of Mor-mon and of the prophets of God who have been raised up in this our own time, and those testimonies willrise up in judgment against this gen-eration and will condemn those who reject them.This kingdom is in our hands to bear it off. The God of heaven is with us. He has sustained us. Heturns away the wrath of man. Hebinds the hands of our enemies and breaks every weapon that is formed against Zion. He has established his people in these valleys of themountains.I would say to bishops, and to all men in authority, we should havean interest in carrying on this work. We should labor to get the Spirit of God. It is our right, our privilegeand our duty to call upon the Lord,that the vision of our mind may be opened, so that we may see and un-derstand the day and age in which we are living. It is your privilege, and mine too, to know the mind andwill of the Lord concerning our du-ties, and if we fail to seek after this, we neglect to magnify our calling.As Brother Taylor has said, here we are at headquarters. We are an ensample for all the other stakes to look at. We should not consider anything we are called to perform a labor. Anything we are called upon to do we should do with a will. I look back to the days of our early missions. Brother Taylor, Brother Brigham, myself and others had togo our ways sick with fever, ague, and the power of death surrounding us; had to leave our wives and chil-dren without food, without raiment, and go without purse and scrip to preach the gospel. We were com-manded of God to do it, and if wehad not done it we should not have been here to-day. But having done these things, God has blessed us.He has sustained the faithful elders of this Church and kingdom, and he will continue to do so until we get through.I wanted to express my feelingsin relation to these matters. I re-flect upon our position. I realize that we have a testimony to bear,and that we shall be held responsi-ble for the manner in which we per-form our duties. As apostles, seven-ties, elders, priests, &c., we are ac-countable to the Most High God. If we do our duty, then our skirts will be clean. We are watchmen upon the walls of Zion. It is our duty to warn the inhabitants of the earth of the things that are to come, and if they reject our testimony, then their blood will be upon their own heads. When the judgments of God over-take the wicked they cannot say they have not been warned. My garments, and the garments of thou-sands of others, are clean of the peo-ple of this generation, as also the garments of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and those of the elders of Israel who have died in the faith. We have borne our testimony, and when the judgments of God come,men cannot say they have not been warned. I consider our position be-fore this generation is of vast im-portance to us and them. I do not want, when I go into the spirit world, to have this generation rise up and condemn me, and say I have not done my duty.There never was a generation like this. There has never been a people like this. There has never been a work like this since God made the world. True, there have been men who have preached the Gospel; butin the fulness of times the Lord hasset his hand to establish his king-dom. This is the last dispensation. He has raised up men and women to carry on his work, and as I have often said, many of us have been held in the spirit world from the or-ganization of this world until the generation in which we live. Our lives have been hid with Christ in God, and the devil has sought to kill us from the day we were born until thepresent hour. But the Lord has preserved us. He has given us the priesthood, he has given us the kingdom and the keys thereof. Shallwe disappoint our Heavenly Father? Shall we disappoint the ancient prophets and apostles who looked forward to this day? Shall we dis-appoint Joseph Smith, and those brethren who have gone before, who laid the foundation of this work and left us to labor after them? Breth-ren, for God's sake do not let us set our hearts on the things of this world to the neglect of the things ofeternal life. Do not let the bishops feel it is a hard matter to carry out any of the counsels given by those who are called to direct all these things. Bless you souls, if you livedhere in the flesh a thousand years, as long as Father Adam, and lived and labored all your life in poverty, and when you got through, if by your acts you could secure your wives and children in the morning of the first resurrection, to dwell with you in the presence of God,that one thing would amply pay you for the labors of a thousand years. What is anything we can do or suf-fer to be compared with the multi-plicity of kingdoms, thrones and principalities that God has revealed to us?Well, we have got the kingdom, and we must bear it off. It won'tpay you nor me to apostatize. But then, there is this danger, you know. Brother Joseph used to counsel us in this wise: "The moment you per-mit yourselves to lay aside any duty that God calls you to perform, to gratify your own desires; the mo-ment you permit yourselves to be-come careless, you lay a foundationfor apostasy. Be careful; understandyou are called to a work, and when God requires you to do that work do it." Another thing he said: "In all your trials, tribulations and sick-ness, in all your sufferings, even unto death, be careful you don't betray God, be careful you don't betray the priesthood, be careful you don't apos-tatize; because if you do, you will besorry for it." We received a great deal of that kind of counsel, and Ihave remembered it from that day until the present.But I do not wish to detain you. I felt to back up the testimony Brother Taylor has given. I take it to my-self. I can make nothing by neg-lecting any duty. I have never com-mitted a sin in this Church and kingdom but what it has cost me athousand times more than it was worth. We cannat sin with impu-nity; we cannot neglect any coun-sel with impunity, but what it willbring sorrow; and the only safe way is to round up our shoulders and do our duty, and thus bear off the king-dom. None of us have a long time to stay here. When I look around and reflect upon my brethren that are gone I ask, where are they? Where are they gone? Here is Brother Taylor, myself and others,who form part of the early organiza-tion of this quorum, who have trav-eled with the Church for a great many years; but Brother Joseph Smith and others have been gonefor a long time—gone into the spirit world. While I reflect upon these things I often ask, what are their views toward us? How does theLord look upon us a people? I consider the Lord and the heavenly hosts are watching us. I know they manifest great interest in our wel-fare and in the course we pursue. Ido not want to miss salvation. I want to go where Brother Joseph is. I want to go to my Heavenly Father,and to his Son Jesus Christ, and to the old prophets who lived in theirgenerations.Let us try to live our religion. Let us seek for the Holy Spirit, that itmay dwell in our bosoms day by day. Bless your souls, we have all we wantof this world's goods. Who ever saw a people so well off as the people of Utah in these valleys of the moun-tains? Who has given us these things? Our heavenly Father. He has blessed the land for our use. This donation that has been made, some may call it a sacrifice; but Brother Taylor had a desire to stretch out the hand of kindness to the oppressed of the Latter-day Saints. We want them to have the benefit of this. We should there-fore labor with a will. No matter how long you are a bishop, your work will be closed in the flesh by and by. Where are many of the bishops of this church and kingdom who held office thirty years ago? Gone; and the bishops who are hereto-night others will supply theirplaces by and by. We will all passaway in our turn, and the faithfulwill come forth at the coming of theSon of Man, which is but a little while.I feel anxious that we may not forget God; I feel anxious that we may not forget the position we occu-py before him; for I will say this concerning myself: if ever I hadany satisfaction or happiness, I havehad it in "Mormonism." If there is anything to me or about me, ithas been given to me in "Mormon-ism." If I have ever received any blessings; if I have ever had power to testify of the things of God, and been the means of bringing any into the church and kingdom of God, it has been by the power of God, or by that which is termed "Mormon-ism," the gospel of Christ. I know it is the power of God that has ac-complished these things. It hasbeen by the power of God that wehave received all we are in possessionof—our riches, our gifts, our wives and our children. How many of you have had sealed upon your heads kingdoms, powers and princi-palities in the world to come? Who can compare these blessings with gold and silver and the things ofthis world? Or what is to be com-pared with the gift of eternal life?I pray God, our Heavenly Father, to bless you, to bless all those whobear the holy priesthood; that the blessings of God may be over you.I feel that we as a people have gotto rise up and clothe ourselves with the power of God. There must be areformation, or a change, in our midst. There is too much evilamong us. The devil has got toomuch power over us. A good many that bear the name of Christ and the holy priesthood are getting coldin the things of God. We must wake up; we must trim our lamps, and be prepared for the coming ofthe Son of Man. May God bless you. May he guide and direct us all. May he keep us in the hollow of his hand. May he sanctify us and prepare us to inherit eternal life, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

 The evening was occupied by elder Hedlock, about one hour, in treating uponthose labours and duties which were necessary for the Saints to enter into for theirtemporal and spiritual salvation, which was listened to with great attention; but he and elder Ward were both called to leave, in the midst of the meeting, in time to take the train for Liverpool, as their duties called them home; but no sooner had they started to leave the room than there was a rush of Saints to take the parting hand with them, that it was with much difficulty they could get out of the house; the silent but hearty shake of the hand on that occasion spoke in languagelouder than words the sentiments of the heart. When the house came to order the meeting was addressed by the President for a season, and brought to a close; and for one, I must say, it was, indeed, good to be there; the time seemed too short while mingling our joys with such spirits in rejoicing in the principles of eternal truth.I have every reason to believe that the Manchester Conference, under the super-intendence of elder Holmes, assisted by elders Miller, Ross, and the many faithfulelders in the various branches, will be much blessed, and bring forth much fruit,to the praise and glory of God.I also attended the Bradford Quarterly Conference, in Yorkshire, on the 23rdFebruary. It was held in the Philadelphia Chapel, North Wing. This is the conference in which, the worthy elder Lorenzo D. Barnes was presiding over when he died; it is now in the hands of our beloved brother Elijah F.Sheets, who, though young, is pursuing the same wise and prudent course thatmarked the life of elder Barnes.I was much delighted in my visit to this conference, elder Sheets presided, goodorder generally prevailed, the chapel was filled through the day and evening with the Saints and citizens. The singers were favoured with a band of music through the conference, which added much interest to the singing. Many Saints were present from Idle and Leeds, and I was happy in beholding the unity, order and peace that bound the Saints together in the Bradford Conference.The fore part of the day was taken up in representing the branches of the con-ference and teaching the principles; in the afternoon the sacrament was adminis-tered, four were confirmed, several children blessed, and the ordinances explainedto the assembly.In the evening I addressed a large audience on the origin, progress, and prin-ciples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also gave an account ofthe death of the prophet and patriarch, while the hearts of the Saints were madeglad, their countenances beaming with joy: the whole audience listened with the most profound attention, and a good impression seemed to be made upon the peoplethrough the whole conference.I also addressed the people on the Monday evening. I had the impression whilethere, that good will yet be done in that region. I held one meeting with the Saints in Idle, and visited the grave of elder Barnes, and spent my time while in Idle with elder Cordingly and his family, who had the charge of elder Barnesthrough his sickness and death; I spared no pains in making all diligent inquriesconcerning him during his labours, sickness, and death, in that place. I shallendeavour to communicate in some future number of the STAR what information I could obtain upon that subject; I consider it due the Zion Camp, his friends inAmerica, the quorum to which he belongs, and the whole church in whose lovehe shared, that there should be a stone erected over his grave to say to all his friendsthat may chance to pass that way, that there sleeps in peace the worthy LorenzoD. Barnes, the first member of Zion's Camp or gospel messenger from Nauvoo, who has found a grave in a foreign land.And I here take the liberty to say to all the Saints or friends of Elder D. Barnes, throughout this realm, that inasmuch as they would esteem it a favour to donateanything for the purpose of erecting a stone over the grave of elder Lorenzo D.Barnes, that if they will forward it by the presiding elders of their conference, orsome other person, to me, at the General Conference, on the 6th of April next, to be held in Manchester, I pledge myself that it shall be appropriated for that use.WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 with artificial fly. It was the first time I had ever seen this mode of fishing,and it appeared decidedly the most skilful in the whole routine of fishing. Father Smithies is seventy years of age, in good health, and as a fisherman is not supposed to be surpassed in the country. On our return to Clitheroe we visited the oldcastle or tower in that place, which appears to have been a very strong hold in itsday.On Sunday the 11th, I attended the quarterly  Conference at Clitheroe.  Elder Speakman was called to preside. The fore part of the day was taken up with a representation of the branches; some alterations in the conference, and in the ordination of one elder, two priests, three teachers, and three deacons. A shorttime was also occupied in giving instructions.In the afternoon we administered the sacrament, after which the Saints werecalled upon to occupy the time in bearing testimony to the work of God. Thebrethren and sisters followed each other in their testimony one by one, until a con-siderable number had spoken, and truly the spirit and power of God rested uponthe assembly until they were melted into tears; many wept while bearing their testimony; it was indeed, an interesting time to us all.The elder said that when brother Kimball left him, he told him to take good careof his lambs; he said he had endeavoured to do so, and indeed they had been aslambs, and as children obedient and willing to hearken to counsel.While sitting in the midst of the testimony of those loving Saints, I was over-whelmed with the spirit and power of God, and the simplicity, love, and union ofthe Saints who were assembled, I had not power of utterance to express the feel-ings of my heart, but found myself in tears of joy and gladness. I addressedthe Saints in the evening, and had a full house, and at the dismissal of the meet-ing, when I was called to take my leave of them, the hearty shake of the hand,and the flowing tears spoke louder the sentiments of the heart than the wordswhich accompanied them of "Good bye," and "God bless you!" My prayer to God is, that he will bless that people and all faithful Saints, and give them a standing with the sons and daughters of Zion.I left Clitheroe on the 12th and arrived in Preston in the evening, and had the privilege of addressing a large assembly of Saints and friends from the ##Psalm 102:16|102ndPsalm and 16th verse##. I was followed by elder Milton Holmes. We both felt thespirit of the subject, and had a good meeting. Elder Hardy, the presiding elder of the conference, was present. Preston was the first place to receive the workin this country, and it has produced much good fruit, and the Saints there stillhave the Spirit of the work.W. WOODRUFF.A DAY OF PRAYER AND FASTING.If the ancient Saints could be benefitted through the principle of prayer andfasting, so can we, and we think it would be a benefit to us; therefore we feel disposed to appropriate our time on the 27th of June, for the purpose of prayer and fasting before the Lord, and we would recommend to all the Saints to assemble themselves together upon that day and evening, as far as their circumstances will allow, in their usual places of worship, and offer up their offerings and prayers in behalf of bleeding Zion. Let your prayers ascend into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth in her behalf, that her stakes may be strengthened, her bounds enlarged;that her watchmen may be sustained and upheld through the mercy of God, that her widows and orphans, whose husbands and fathers were slain for the word of God, may be fed, clothed and blessed, and that the temple of the Lord may becompleted according to the pattern given, and accepted of the God of Israel; and that the elders in the far distant islands of the sea, with all the faithful ones in the vineyard, may have many souls given them as seals of their ministry, and return to Zion bringing their sheaves with them.W.

 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS'MILLENNIAL STAR."To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this wordit is because there is no light in them."—ISAIAH viii, 20.No. 36, Vol. L. Monday, September 3, 1888. Price One Penny.A PIONEER ADDRESS.THE following address from President Wilford Woodruff was read beforethe assembled Sabbath schools of Salt Lake City at their celebration of Pioneer Day:To the Pioneers and Citizens, and tothe Officers and Members of theSabbath Schools.MY DEAR FRIENDS, Forty-one years ago this day I passed through Immigration Canyon with President Brigham Young. He was taken sick on East Canyon Creek, and I made a bed for him in my carriage. When we came upon the bench, where we had a fair view of the valley before us, I turned the side of the vehicle to the west, so that he could obtain a fair view of the valley. President Young arose from his bed and took a survey of the country before him for several minutes. He then said to me, "Drive on down into the valley; this is our abiding place. I have seen it before in vision. In this valley will be built the City of the Saints and the Temple of our God." I drove down to the encampment already formed by a por-tion of our company, who had cut a road through the quaking-asp groves of timber which were in the bed of the canyon and come in ahead of us. We arrived in the encampment at 11:30 on the morning of the 24th of July, 1847. The brethren had already turned out City Creek and irrigated the dry and barren soil, being the first irrigation ever performed by any one in these mountains in this age. They had also commenced to plough some ground, and that noble pioneer, Wil-liam Carter, whose circumstances pre-vent him meeting with the pioneers to-day, broke the first ground and laid the first furrow. The ploughshare that performed the work is on the stand to-day. On my arrival in camp, before I ate my dinner, I planted two bushels of potatoes in the ground broken up. President Young com-menced to recover from his sickness the hour he entered the valley. On a day or two following our arrival a remarkable incident occurred. While President Young was walking with several of the apostles on the higher ground north-west of the encamp-ment, he suddenly stepped out, struck his cane into the barren ground and sagebrush, and exclaimed, "Right here will stand the Temple of our 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFwas the next speaker. He said:I feel that I want to say to you,my brethren and sisters, God blessyou. And I feel to bless you. I am thankful that I have the privilegeof spending a few moments here and bearing my testimony to theChurch and Kingdom of God hereon earth, backing up the testimonyof Brother Cannon.The God of heaven has set Hishand to carry out one of His pur-poses concerning the history of thisworld and its inhabitants. In theformation and creation of the worldthe Lord had before Him the wholehistory of the children of God, of theinhabitants of the earth. All men who have been readers and are ac-quainted with the revelations of Godin those records that have been handed down to us, can clearly see that if God has had a people on theearth, He has given unto that peo-ple the Holy Priesthood, the revela-tions of heaven, and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We read in the Rev-elations of St. John and other por-tions of the Scriptures, that in thelast days the God of heaven would set His hand to establish His king-dom to be thrown down no more for-ever. [##Revelation 11:15##] [##Daniel 2:44##] You and I have lived to see that day. The Lord has set His hand to call forth the children of men to receive His Gospel and HisPriesthood. There is this one peculiar principles connected with the King-dom of God in every age of the world, and that is, every man andwoman is dependent upon God Him-self for all the blessings and all the power that they possess to carry out His purposes. There is no changeof the Priesthood from eternity unto eternity. It has dwelt with the Godof Israel from eternity unto eternity, and will remain unchangeable.There is no change in the ordinancesof the Gospel of life and salvation. There never has been; there never will be to the endless ages of eter-nity. And whenever that Gospel has been offered to the sons of men, the Holy Priesthood has had to besent down to aid in carrying outGod's work. There is no man who ever breathed the breath of life since God made the world who has had power to go forth and adminis-ter in the ordinances of the Gos-pel of Christ without that Priesthood.Another thing I wish to say: Al-most sixty years have passed sincethe Church was organized here onthe earth, and the Lord has car-ried out one peculiar principle, and that is this—He has chosen theweak things of the world to con-found the wise, and things whichare not to bring to pass things which are. You may begin with the creation of the world. You may take all the servants of theAlmighty that the God of Israel has ever made use of in any age of the world to carry out His work, and they have been the weak sonsof Adam; they have been the weak instruments, from a worldly standpoint, in the hands of Al-mighty God. Why has the Lord chosen that class of men? Because they have been in a posi-tion that they were obliged to acknowledge the hand of God in all the power they possessed. Take our own day. Brother Cannonhas referred to this people, to thisChurch and Kingdom. He has toldyou the truth. When the time came, in fulfillment of the revelations ofSt. John and the ancient patriarchsand prophets, for Him to establishHis Kingdom on the earth, He raisedup a class of men suitable for the pur-pose. I will here say, the Lord has never undertaken to perform any work, in any dispensation or genera-tion, without preparing a people for it. The Lord raised up a young man—Joseph Smith. His spirit was kept in the eternal world for sixthousand years, to come forth byappointment, through the loins of ancient Joseph and Ephraim, to stand in the flesh and to establish this Church and Kingdom. And he only lived long enough to perform it. He only lived long enough to bring forth the record of the Book ofMormon,—the stick of Joseph in thehands of Ephraim, and put it withthe stick of Judah, in fulfillment ofthe revelations of God; and then go forth and organize the Church, withall the instruments, all the knowl-edge, that all the divines through-out the world did not have power to do, neither did they know how to perform that work. [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##] He was the firstman in the last days that ever organ-ized a church upon the foundation of Apostles and Prophets, ChristJesus being the chief corner stone, according to the order as it was in the days of the Savior. And when He established this work, he established it with prophets, with apostles, with pastors, withteachers, with gifts, with helps,with graces, with the Holy Priest-hood, with the power of God, and with the ordinances thereof. It istrue, he waded in deep water. It is true that he was sacrificed. Whenhe had got the foundation of thiswork laid, he himself laid down his life. He was martyred in a Christian country for the work of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. He was martyred for his religion. He sealedhis testimony with his blood, asJesus and other patriarchs and prophets sealed the dispensationsin which they lived.From that day until now, this Churchand Kingdom has continued to grow and increase. It mattered not whatamount of persecution, what amount of affliction, what amount of opposi-tion we had to meet with. That Godwho created the heavens and the earth holds this Church and King-dom on His hands. And I here say to my brethren and sisters, theChurch and Kingdom of God is here.It has come to stay. It has been or-ganized to stay; and that God whohas organized it will sustain it until the scene is wound up.I have been reflecting since sitting in the stand here, where are our brethren to whom we have listened for years and years? Where is Pres-ident Young? Where is Brother Kimball? Where are Orson and Parley Pratt? Where is George A. Smith? Where is President JohnTaylor? And where are all thoseother Apostles who have passed away? They are in the spirit world, mingling with the Gods, con-nected with all the patriarchs and prophets who have ever lived on the earth. You may ask the ques-tion: Why is it, then, that God, with the Savior, with Father Adam,with Noah, with Enoch, with the ancient patriarchs and prophets, andwith all the Apostles who have lived in this day and generation, counsel-ing together on the other side of thevail, do not have power to turn away this persecution that Brother Cannon has been speaking of? Jesus told His disciples that if he were to pray to the Father, He would give Him a legion of angelswho would come to defend Him; but,He said, the will of the Father would not in that way be fulfilled.So I say to you. If many things that we might desire in our hearts shouldbe fulfilled, the work of the Lord would fail in being consummated. We should remember that this gener-ation, like all other generations, have their own agency. The nation inthe midst of which we dwell today has its agency. The nations of theearth all have their agency. All sects and parties have; in fact, all thehuman family. And the God of heaven will hold them responsi-ble. He will hold us responsible, according to the course we pursue. If we work and fight against Godand the Kingdom of God, we have got to meet that in days to come.Brother Cannon has referred tothe situation of men who have fought against this work. Yes, brethren and sisters, we have seenthis from the organization of theChurch; we shall see it until thescene is wound up. But I want to tell you one thing, and that is, the God of heaven has not gone to sleep; neither has He gone on a longjourney; nor has He forgotten Hispeople. Does He intend to with-draw His hand? "Leave judg-ment with me; it is mine, saith the Lord; I will repay." [##Romans 12:19##] It is our busi-ness to leave judgment with the Lord in all these matters. Let us do our duty.Joseph Smith said fifty years agolast June, in speaking of the Priest-hood—you can read it in the history of the Church—"Men profess to prophesy. I will also prophesy. I say, in the name of the Lord, that the signs of the coming of the Son of Man have already commenced in the earth, and from this time hence-forth will the judgments of God be manifest among the nationsof the earth. Wars, blood-shed, earthquakes, storms, thun-der, lightning, pestilence, fam-ine and the judgments of God willfollow in their turn; and when thesethings go forth upon the earth, theywill never be returned or withheld until the work of God is wound up." Let Israel read, let the inhabitantsof the earth read, with regard to the signs of the times, and what do you see? There are a great many thingsmanifested that the world do notacknowledge the hand of God in; but we do and we should. There-fore I would say to the Latter-daySaints, it is the will of God that youshould not be discouraged; that you 
 enters the spirit world preached thegospel there to those who lived after him; but they all preach to men who were in the flesh before they were. Jesus himself preached to the antediluvian world, who had been in prison for thousandsof years. So with Joseph Smith and the elders—they will have to preach to the inhabitants of the earth who have died during the last seventeen centuries; and when they hear thetestimony of the elders and accept it there should be somebody on the earth, as we have been told, to at-tend to the ordinances of the house of God for them, that they may be judged according to men in the flesh and come forth in the morning of the first resurrection and have a part therein with us.These are eternal principles of the gospel of Christ. We have been commanded and have been under the necessity of going forth and de-claring it to the sons of men. I willask by what power have these apos-tles and elders taken their knapsackson their backs, wading swamps and rivers, and preaching without purseand scrip, as they have done for years and years past and gone. What power has sustained them?As I have said before, these revela-tions of God, these great command-ments and prophecies that have been given for the last six thousand years. They have been inspired by the Spirit and power of God, they have been commanded to go forthand warn this generation by preach-ing the Gospel to them. Here is President Brigham Young has trav-eled, as poor as any man could be,tens of thousand miles, withoutpurse and scrip, to preach the gos-pel to the sons of men. So have his brethren. They have been sus-tained by the hand of the Almighty, and if they had not done it theywould have been under condemna-tion. Why? The angel of God, who restored the everlasting gospel to earth, said it must be preached toevery nation, kindred, tongue and people under the whole heaven, forthe hour of God's judgement had come. The hour of God's judgment is at the door of this nation and theChristian world. Brother ErastusSnow here, a week last Sunday, told us about preaching to the dead, and the judgments that awaitedthe nations. Other elders have re-ferred to the same subject. But sev-enteen hundred years have passed without prophets, apostles and pa-triarchs. The judgments of God did not rest upon the nations of the earth during that time as they will after the proclamation of this gospel.This message that Joseph Smith brought to the world involves the destinies of this whole generation, not only of this nation, but the whole Christian and Jewish world, Zion and Babylon, the whole of it. They now stand, as it were, warned of the Lord. The gospel has had to go to them. We have been obliged to go abroad to preach the gospel to the nations; we should have been condemned, and smitten by the armof Jehovah, if we had failed to ful-fill the revelations given unto us. It is by that power that President Young, Joseph Smith, the Twelve Apostles, and the thousands of elders of Israel have been moved upon to go forth and do the work of God.Now then, my friends, are we going to stop here? Are the rest of the prophecies not to be fulfilled?Is the Lord going to cut his work in two, or let the rest go unfulfilled? I tell you nay, the word of the Lord is going to be fulfilled, and the Lord is not going to give this kingdom toanother people. The Lord has rais-ed up a set of men and women, and he will inspire and move upon themto carry out this great work, and we have got it to do. Zion is going to rise and shine, and to put on herbeautiful garments; she will be clothed with the glory of God, and for brass she will have gold; for ironsilver and for stone iron. All these revelations touching the last dayshave got to be fulfilled. PresidentYoung is moved upon to call upon Zion to do her duty. Why is hethus moved upon? Because the power of revelation surrounds himand crowds upon him to magnifyhis calling and do his duty among the sons of men. The power of God rests upon him, and he willnever hold his peace until Zion isbuilt up and perfected, the house of Israel gathered and the work of God performed under his administration as long as he dwells in the flesh.He is as much under the power of God and the revelations of JesusChrist as any man that ever breath-ed the breath of life.We have got to build this temple. The Lord requires it at our hands. We have to pay our tithing—theLord requires it at our hands. TheLord has never said by any revela-tion that Brigham Young should build a temple alone, that his coun-sellors, or that the Apostles or bish-ops should do it alone. This re-sponsibility rests upon every man and woman who has entered intocovenant with the Lord in these latter days; and if we do not dis-charge it we shall suffer, the Lord will chastise us. He is not going to leave us, and he is not going to take this kingdom away from the Latter-day Saints and give it to anybody else, for they are the Saints, and al-though mixed like corn in a sieve among the Gentile nations theyhave been prepared from the founda-tion of the world to come forth as the sons of Jacob in these latter days, to build up the Zion of God on the earth. We have got to come to it. We must give our earnest sup-port to co-operation, for it is a stepin advance towards establishing theOrder of Enoch and the building upof the Zion of God. The servant ofGod is moved upon to call upon usto perform this work, and we haveit to do.There are some prophecies per-taining to these latter days that are unpleasant to contemplate. Presi-dent Young has been calling upon the daughters of Zion day after day,now, for years, to lay aside these Babylonish fashions. I have been reading the third chapter of Isaiahand I have been hoping, all the days of my ministry, that the sayings contained in that chapter wouldnever apply to the daughters of Zionin our day; but I believe they will,and inasmuch as they will not listen to President Young and to the pro-phets, apostles and elders of Israelwith regard to throwing off these nonsensical things, I hope they will hasten the lengthening out of their skirts and drag them in the streets; that they will increase their round tires like the moon, increase theirhoops, and their headbands, in-crease their Grecian bends at onceand carry it out until they getthrough with it, so that we can turn to the Lord as a people. Some of the daughters of Zion do not seemwilling to forsake the fashions of Babylon. I to such would say hasten it, and let the woe that isthreatened on this account come,that we may get through with it,then we can go on and build up the Zion of God on the earth. But in spite of the follies that some among us delight in, we are going to build up Zion. We are going to fill these mountains with the cities and peo-ple of God. The weapons formed against Zion will be broken, and the nations of the Gentiles will visit her and their kings will come to the brightness of her rising. I often think when I see gentlemen and ladies sitting in our tabernacles, who have come over this great high-way that has been cast up, whetherthey realize that they are fulfilling the prophecies of Isaiah. I think this many times in my own mind. I am satisfied that they do not real-ize it, but they are fulfilling the rev-elations of God. The Gentiles are coming to the light of Zion and kings to the brightness of her ris-ing. All these things have been spoken of and will be fulfilled; andby and by, when we are sanctified and made perfect, when we are chastised and humbled before the Lord, when we have got our eyes opened, and our hearts set upon building up the kingdom of God, then will we return and rebuild thewaste places of Zion. We have gotthis to fulfill in our day and genera-tion. Then think not, ye elders ofIsrael, ye sons and daughters ofZion, that we are going to live afterthe order of Babylon always. We are not. We shall be chastised and afflicted, and shall feel the chasten-ing rod of the Almighty, unless weserve the Lord our God, and build up his kingdom, for he has given us all power; yes, all power is giveninto our hands to perform this work.Where is the man or the womanon the face of the earth who can-not see the hand of God in our de-liverance until to-day? Every wea-pon has been broken that has ever been formed against us. Point me out an individual or a people who have ever taken a stand against Jo-seph Smith or Brigham Young, the Zion of God or the elders of Israel,and who have sought to overthrow this work, but what the curse of God has rested upon them. Show me one of that class who has not gone down to the dust, and as it has been in days past so it will be in days to come. Woe to that nation, kindred, tongue and people underthe whole heavens who war againstZion in the latter-days; every wea-pon shall be broken that is formedagainst her, and that nation thatwill not serve her shall be utterlywasted away saith the Lord of hosts. These things are true, and I would warn Jew and Gentile, saint and sinner and all the world to becareful what they do as touching them.A few words more to the Latter-day Saints. I want to say to thebrethren and to the sisters, let us cease finding fault one with another;let us not say that this man or this woman does wrong, this family doeswrong, this person or the other sets a bad example; let us realize that we ourselves are held responsiblefor what we do. It will do me no good if I apostatize because some-body's family follows the fashions of Babylon, or because some man or woman or some set of men and women do wrong. Let us cease this kind of work, and all of us look to ourselves. It will do me no good if I apostatize because I think somebody else does not do right. We should lay aside this, there is too much of it in the Zion of God to-day, and has been a good while, finding fault with this, that and the other, instead of looking athome. Let us all look at home, and each one try to govern his own family and set his own house in order, and do that which is required of us, realizing that each one is held responsible before the Lord for his or her individual actions only.I pray God my heavenly Father that he will pour out his Spiritupon the daughters of Zion, upon themothers in Zion, upon the elders,and upon all her inhabitants, thatwe may listen to the counsels of the servants of God, that we may be justified in the sight of God, that we may be preserved in the faith, that we may have power to build temples, build up Zion, re-deem our dead, and be redeemed ourselves, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

 37  THE DESERET NEWS. Feb. 8DISCOURSE BYPREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVEREDIn the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,Sunday Afternoon, October23, 1881.REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.THERE being a little time left us this afternoon, I feel disposed to make a few remarks to those who are present. There is one principlewhich has been universally acknow-ledged by the Latter-day Saints, by Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, the Apostles and all the leading men of the Church: I have heard Joseph Smith and Brigham Young say that if they had the power over the whole world, over every human being who breathes the breath of life, they would give every inhabitant of the earth the right to worship God ac-cording to the dictates of their own conscience. This is a principle which we believe in as Latter-day Saints, we ever have believed in it, and it is a principle which even the laws of our country, the constitution of our government holds out to all of its citizens. What! would you give the Methodist, the Baptists, etc., the privilege of enjoying their religion? Certainly. Our city abounds with churches of different denominations. Have they ever been opposed by anybody belongingto this Church in the erection of their churches and in the enjoyment of their religion? I think not. If they have, they should not have been. Why would you do this? Be-cause the God of heaven gives all His children this right and privi-lege, it belongs to the whole human family, every man, woman and child under heaven has the right to worship God according to his desires, according to his own views, and ac-cording to the light which he has. The Lord gives all the children of men this right and privilege. He gives them their agency and holds them responsible for their actions, and while the Lord does this, why should the children of men inter-fere? Why those scenes of blood that have taken place on the earth through religious principles? They are unrighteous. As Latter-day Saints we claim the same right that we would give to the inhabitants of all the world. We say to all men, "Enjoy your religion, worship God according to the dictates of your own conscience." We ask the same right as the children of God. We claim this by the Constitution and laws of our country, and upon this principle we have embraced the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ.The Lord has sent forth angels out of heaven. He has delivered the fulness of the gospel to Joseph Smith. He was raised up as a Pro-phet of God, by the power of God, to lay the foundation of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on the earth, and to lay the foun-dation of that kingdom which the Prophet Daniel and the other Pro-phets spoke of, and to build up that Zion which Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel said should be built up in the latter days. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] [##Isaiah 60:14##] [##Jeremiah 31:6##] [##Ezekiel 36-37##] We believe this with every sentiment of our hearts. Now, in reading the publications of the day, I find there are many men in our country that seem to be filled with great anger against the Lat-ter-day Saints, and they belch forththeir wrath and indignation and animus against us, because we dif-fer from them in some principles pertaining to the Gospel of Christ. Now, here is one principle that I wish to impress upon the minds of every Saint of God who dwells uponthe earth—and I want our reporters to write it down—I want to impressit upon the rulers of our nation and upon all the inhabitants of this na-tion and every other nation, name-ly, that the love of God, faith, hopeand charity, and the gospel of Jesus Christ with all the ordinances thereof, with the Holy Priesthood, which has power both in heaven and on the earth, and the principles which have been revealed for the salvation and exaltation of the children of men—that these are principles you cannot annihilate. They are principles that no combi-nation of men can destroy. They are principles that can never die. Prisons cannot confine them; fire cannot burn them; the sea cannot drown them; no storm can wreck them; no gulf can swallow them up; no grave can entomb them, because they are eternal and will endure forever. They are beyond the reach of man to handle or to destroy. You may put men in prison and abuse them; you may burn men at the stake; you may drive men from their homes who advocate these principles; but it is not in the power of the whole world put together to destroy those principles, they are as firm and independent, as far as the agency of man is concerned, as the pillars of heaven or the throne of God. I want the inhabitants of the earth to hear these things and re-member them. The inhabitants of the earth have tried for generations to destroy these principles. Yet it matters not what may take place on the earth. Republics may be de-stroyed, kingdoms overthrown, em-pires broken up, thrones cast down,the sun may be turned to darkness, the moon to blood, the stars may fall from heaven, and heaven and earth itself may pass away, but not one jot or title of these principles will ever be destroyed. [##Matthew 5:18##] I would to God the world could understand this. It would have been a blessing for them if the Jews could have un-derstood it before they put to death the Lord Jesus Christ. When Jesus Christ came to the Jews He brought the everlasting Gospel. He was of the tribe of Judah himself. He came to his own father's house; he offered them life and salvation; yet He was the most unpopular man in all Judah. The High Priests, the Saducees, the sectarians of the day, were the strongest enemies He had on earth. No matter what he did it was imputed to an evil source. When he cast out devils it was im-puted to the power of Belzebub, the prince of devils. When He opened the eyes of the blind they said: "Give God the praise: we know that his man is a sinner." [##John 9:24##] Thisunpopularity followed the Lord Jesus Christ to the cross where He gave up the ghost. Now, the in-habitants of Judah had an idea that if they could only put to death the Messiah that that would end His mission and work on the earth. Vain hope of that generation as well as this. When they led Jesus to the cross the very moment that spirit departed from that sorrowful tabernacle it held the keys of the kingdom of God in all of its strength and power and glory the same as He had done while in the body. And while the body lay in the tomb, Jesus of Nazareth went and preach-ed to the spirits in prison, and when His mission was ended there His spirit returned again to His taber-nacle. [##1 Peter 3:19##] Did the Jews kill the prin-ciples He taught? No. He burst the bonds of death, He conquered the tomb, and came forth with an immortal body filled with glory and eternal life, holding all the powers and keys He held while in the flesh. Having appeared to some of the holy women and the apostles, He then went and administered to the Nephites upon this continent, and from here he went to the ten tribesof Israel, and delivered to them the gospel and when they return they will bring the history of the dealings of Jesus of Nazareth with them, while in His immortal body. [##3 Nephi 11##] The same unpopularity followed the twelve Apostles. Some of them were sawn asunder, others were beheaded, crucified, etc. But did the Jews destroy the principles they taught? Did they destroy the keys of the kingdom of God? No, verily no. They had no power over these things any more than they had pow-er over the throne of God or God Himself. These men when the spirit left their body returned hold-ing the keys of the kingdom of God into the presence of God.I will here say in passing that there is one principle that it would have been well if the Jews had un-derstood, it would be well if all the inhabitants of the earth understoodit, and that is, that it costs some-thing to shed the blood of the Lord's anointed, to shed the blood of Pro-phets and Apostles and righteous men, to fight against God, against His Christ, and against His work, when these Jews cried out, "Cruci-fy Him, crucify Him," and a Gen-tile judge had declared He could find no fault in Him, still they were ready to say—"All right, you let his blood be upon us and our children." [##Luke 23:21##] [##Matthew 27:22-25##] In this the Almighty took them at their word. The Jews have been trampled under the feet of the Gentiles for 1800 years, in ful-filment of that declaration. The yoke is not even broken to-day. In the eastern world, in Russia, and in all the nations of the earth more or less they are trampled under the feet of the Gentiles. Tens of thousands have been put to death. Nero put to death many, as also did other men in their day and time. Hence you see it has cost the Jews something for the putting to death of the Lord's anointed.Now, I want to say something with regard to the dispensation in which we live. The God of heaven has set His hand to fulfil the vo-lume of revelation which the Biblecontains, to build up that kingdom that Daniel the prophet saw in theinterpretation of the dream of Nebu-chadnezzar. The God of heaven has sent forth that angel which Johnthe Revelator saw "fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting Gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and peo-ple, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6##]That angel has delivered the Gospel to Joseph Smith, and I know it. I bear my record and testimony to this truth. It is the truth of the living God. He has set His hand, as I have said, to build up this king,dom. Isaiah has written its history. Look at these valleys of the moun-tains. I came here on the 24th of July, 1847. What did I find? A barren desert, as barren as the desert of Sahara. There was no mark of the white man. It did not look as if any white man could live here at all. How is it to-day? Tra-vel through the length and breadth of this Territory and behold the cities, towns, villages, gardens, or-chards, fields, and crops that cover this once barren desert. What does it mean? It means that God Al-mighty is carrying out His purposes, it means that He has brought to His remembrance what His pro-phets and Apostles have spoken; and all things shall be fulfilled to the very letter, even to the winding-up scene. From whence has come this congregation; from whence have come the Saints gathered together throughout these mountains of Is-rael? They have been gathered from every nation as far as the Gospel has been preached. We have been gathered together by the pow-er of the Gospel. Yet, as I have re-marked many times in my public discourses, if we had preached until we were as old as Methuselah, we could never have got men and women to leave their homes if they had not been moved upon by the Holy Ghost. The Elders of Israel preached the Gospel unto them and promised them in the name of Jesus Christ that if they would receive this gospel they would receive the Holy Ghost. Is there a man on the face of God's footstool to-day that would dare make such a promise as that unless he were backed up by the power of God? No, not one. If the Elders of Israel had been impos-tors, deceivers, they would have been very soon found out; but the God of Israel has backed up their testimony, and it is on this principle that these valleys are filling with the people of God to-day.Now, I want to say that the same principles which existed in the days of Jesus and His Apostles exist to-day. There is a spirit of oppression,opposition, and persecution againstthe Latter-day Saints, because they differ from the world in their princi-ples of religion. Jesus, however, said in his day: "If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me be-fore it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. [##John 15:18-19##] What is the cause of this hatred? It is because we declare the Gospel of Christ; it is because we believe in Prophets, Apostles, and the gifts and graces of the Gospel; It is because we preach faith, repent-ence, baptism for the remission of sins, the reception of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands; it is be-cause the church is organized with Prophets, Apostles, Priests, Teach-ers, Deacons, etc., according to the ancient order of things. This does not agree with the feelings of the sectarian world, therefore they are opposed to us. "But," says one, "it is your polygamy that has created so much trouble with you 'Mor-mons.'" Oh, indeed, is it? I will ask, where was polygamy when we were driven from Kirtland and Far West, from Jackson, Van Buren, Clay and Davis Counties, Mo., from Nauvoo, etc., to other places, men and women put to death, houses burned, etc.? We suffered more per-secution then than we have ever suffered, ten times over, since poly-gamy was revealed and advocated bythe Elders of Israel. What was the matter then? "Oh, you believe in revelation, you believe in prophetsand apostles. We cannot stand thisyou have got to give up that belief, and if you don't we will destroy you, put you to death, etc." The feeling among the people of the United Stetes then was that if they could only put to death the leaders of the Church, that that would be the end of "Mormonism." So they thought in putting to death Jesus of Nazar-eth, that that would be the end of His teachings in that land. But lo and behold! when they put to death Joseph and Hyrum, they did not kill "Mormonism," they did not kill faith in God, they did not kill hope and charity, they did not do away with the ordinances of the house of God, nor the power of the Holy Priesthood. The God of heaven had ordained these things; He had or-dained men under the hands of Peter, James and John, who held the keys of the kingdom of God in the eternal worlds, and that Priest-hood and the keys thereof was to remain on the earth forever. It is beyond the power of man to destroy it. I want the Latter-day Saints to understand this: "Fear not them," said the Savior "which kill the body,but are not able to destroy the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell." [##Matthew 10:28##]The purposes of the Lord must be fulfilled. There is not one jot ortittle of the Old Book that the sec-tarian world believe in but will be fulfilled. The same with regard to the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants. The opposition of the world cannot stay the progress of this work. Some men are tryingto do so all the time. I dislike to refer to individuals, but I have read lately of a Mr. Talmage, who seems to be in a terrible torment about the "Mormons," and is forever pouring out his wrath and indignation against them. Now, I just want to say that if we had a thousand mil-lion Talmage's, and they were to spend every breath they had they could no more stay the hand of the Almighty in the rolling forth of this work than they could stop the wind from blowing. Why? Be-cause God Almighty holds in His hands the destiny of this people, and of all nations, and this genera-tion will yet realize that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper, and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn," saith Isaiah, and I know he was a prophet. [##Isaiah 54:17##]Now, so far as I am concerned, I want to say to my friends, and to all peoples, I have no fears with re-gard to the kingdom of God; I have no fears with regard to Zion; I have no fears with regard to the Church of Jesus Christ of Datter day Saints, it is in the hands of the Al-mighty, and all that He hath said with regard to its work in the latter-days will come to pass in spite of earth and hell combined. I want the world to understand this. These are eternal truths. The principles will live when our nation is broken to pieces and wasted away, and when we ourselves have passed away to the spirit world. There is no power beneath the heavens that can hinder, stop or destroy the pro-gress of truth and the decrees of Almighty God. I want to have the Latter-day Saints understand these things. We are in the hands of God. This is a very different gene-ration from any other. It is a generation when the Lord has decreed—and that, too, before the world was made—that in the last days the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed nor given to other people; the little stone cut out of the mountains without hands shall become a great moun-tain and fill the whole earth. These are the declarations of the Lord Himself.I will now refer to another princi-ple. I am an American citizen; a great many of this people are, I hope most are. I was born in the State of Connecticut, and many of the New England forms and teach-ings in our childhood, 65 years ago, were good to receive and live by. But what I want to say is: We live in a government raised up by the God of heaven. We have a consti-tution that was given by inspiration from God to man. I believe it is the best human form of government that was ever given to the human family. Now, I say if our rulers and governors become corrupt and attempt to trample those principles under their feet; though the nation itself might go to piecas, yet it is beyond the power of man to destroy the principles of the constitution. They may destroy one another, yet the principles contained in that in-strument will live, and the God of heaven will maintain them until Jesus Christ comes in the clouds of heaven to set up His throne in Je-rusalem, and to reign on the earth athousand years.I felt that I would like to say so much. I want my brethren and sisters to understand these matters. We should live our religion. I have no fears with regard to the King-dom of God. We may have fears in regard to ourselves. This man may apostatize, the others may apostatize, John Taylor, myself, or anybody else may die, but it will make no dif-ference with regard to this work. Israel will never be without a law-giver. Zion will become all that Israel saw it, in its beauty, power and glory in the earth. I wanted to say so mch to strangers here as well as Latter-day Saints. We believe in these principles with every senti-ment of our soul. We expect to live them, we are ready to die for them, but they will never be destroyed. We may go to prison, we may suffer all manner of persecution, but the principles we advocate will remain forever. When Joseph Smith's body was laid in the grave, his spirit, like unto the Son of God, went into the spirit world with the keys of this dispensation to unlock the prison doors. There were fifty thou-sand million of spirits that never saw the face of a Prophet, or heard a gospel sermon in their lives until Joseph Smith preached to them the message of salvation. Those people in the spirit-world have got to have equal rights in the Gospel disdensation with those on the earth. That is the reason whyJesus went to preach to the spirits in prison. Joseph Smith will hold the keys of this dispensation throughout the countless ages of eternity, as Peter, James and John will hold theirs. He (Joseph Smith) will come forth in the morning of the first resurrection, and will rise up in judgment against this genera-tion. He sealed his testimony with his blood. That testimony is in force upon all the world from the hour of his death. These are eter-nal truths. I hate to see any na-tion, I hate to see our own govern-ment, I hate to see the clergy of theday rise up in anger against these Latter-day Saints because they dif-fer from them in principles of reli-gion. We know for ourselves this Gospel is true. We know it has been given unto us by the revelation of God. We know it will stand. The power of God will be made manifest. These valleys will be filled with Latter-day Saints. We will grow and increase until the coming of the Son of Man. Whatever men may do, as I have said before, they are in the hands of God.I pray God, my Heavenly Father, that He may instil these principles into your hearts, that they may ac-complish the mission for which they have been sent. Even so, Amen. 
 Sept. 15 THE DESERET NEWS. 515ple you can learn and understandthe mind of God. Revelation hasbeen looked upon by this Church, aswell as by the world, as somethingvery marvelous. What is revelation? The testimony of the Father and Son. How many of you have had revelation? How many of you have had the Spirit of God whisper untoyou—the still small voice. I wouldhave been in the spirit world a greatmany years ago, if I had not fol-lowed the promptings of the still small voice. These were the reve-lations of Jesus Christ, the strongest testimony a man or a woman can have. I have had many testimoniessince I have been connected with this Church and Kingdom. I have been blessed at times with certaingifts and graces, certain revelationsand ministrations; but with themall I have never found anything thatI could place more dependence uponthan the still small voice of theHoly Ghost.I know this is the work of God. I know God is with this people. I am anxious for them. I am anxious forthe rising generation, for the youngmen and young women, for I knowthis kingdom has got to rest upontheir shoulders. When I see theevils that exist in Salt Lake City, Irealize they are in danger. Our re-sponsibilities as parents are great. We have not only to set an example ourselves, but we must pray for them,and counsel them, and I am satisfiedthat the Lord will prepare our youngmen and young maidens, the sons and daughters of this people, so thatthey will take this kingdom and bear it off. The kingdom will neverbe thrown down or given to anotherpeople.I thank God I live in this day andage of the world. I thank God that I heard the gospel. I thank theLord I have been made partaker ofthe holy priesthood in connectionwith the gospel, and all the fears Ihave had have been about myselfand friends. I never had any fearsabout the kingdom of God. I do nothave any to-day. I realize and un-derstand, as well as I know any-thing, that this kingdom is ordainedto stand. It will grow and increase. Zion will arise and put on her beau-tiful garments. The only fears thatI have are with regard to myself, myfamily, my wives and my children.We are surrounded with temptationswhich have a tendency to lead us away. We have got to guardagainst them; we have got to in-crease our faith and live nearer andnearer to the Lord.I pray God to bless you and blessthis people, and bless those who are called to watch over us. We have got to watch as well as pray. Wehave got to guard the Church andkingdom of God. By and by our mission will close. We will soonpass away and shall reap our reward. We are living in the last dispensa-tion. Joseph Smith, I expect, willsound the sixth trumpet. He will be at the head of this dispensation;or, if he does not blow the trumpet of this dispensation, I do not knowwho will. Somebody has got to doit, and it must be somebody holding the keys of the various dispensationsof the world. No other angels arecoming from any other world to ad-minister in this dispensation; those men will minister who dwelt herein the flesh.May God bless us and help us to keep his commandments, for Jesus' sake.   Amen.

 should have faith in the revelationsof heaven and in those records that have been left for us and our guid-ance. Remember your brethren be-fore the Lord. Be true and faithful unto this Church and King-dom of God. It has been organized and established by thepower of God, and not of man. Howdid Joseph Smith have power, as I have before said, to organize the Church as it has been organized—the best organization on the face ofthe earth? It is because it was organized by revelation. How did these hundreds and thousands of Elders of Israel, many of whom arehere to-day, have power to goabroad, without purse and scrip,and preach the Gospel to the convincing of the sons and daughters of Adam?It has been done by the power ofGod. No Elder in this Church hashad power to go forth and do the will of God only by the power ofGod. If we have any power, it isof God, and we should trust Him with regard to all things.Brethren and sisters, do not be discouraged. The Kingdom of God is established here in these valleys of the everlasting hills. These arethe valleys and these are the moun-tains given by our father Jacob to his son Joseph—the utmost boundsof the everlasting hills, promisedunto Joseph, who was separated from his brethren, and whose sonsand daughters ye are. Let us befaithful. Let us try to do our duty.Let us endeavor to honor God. Wehave a long eternity before us. Wehave a great future before us. Zion will arise and shine, and the glory ofGod will rest upon her. Israel willbe gathered, Jerusalem will be re-built, Zion be established and throwndown no more forever. Thesethings are in the record of divinetruth. Not one of them will everfail of fulfillment. They were given by revelation. No matter whatthe feelings of our enemies maybe. No matter what the feeling may be of those who differ in prin-ciple from us. They have the right to their own religion, and we haveno right to disturb them. But if they war against God, against His Zion, against His people, they have got to pay the bill, the same as wehave for the deeds done in the body. This nation will be held responsiblefor the course they have pursuedtowards the Zion of God. It hasalways been to me one of thestrongest evidences—and it should be to all Latter-day Saints, if not to the world—the fact that all earth and hell, if I may be allowed to use such an expression, have been combined against this Church from the day that Joseph Smith brought forth theBook of Mormon and organized this Church with six members. Why is this? Would this opposition havebeen if it were not the Kingdom of God? It would not. For that rea-son the powers of darkness are stirred up. Darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the mindsof the people. The judgments ofGod are in the land, and the day will come when the nations will learn and understand that there is aGod in Israel.I bear my record and my testi-mony that this is the work of God. The Lord has called us here; and we should not forget Him. We should not forget our prayers. Go before the Lord and make our wants known, and He will hear our pray-ers and sustain us in carrying out this work until the scene is woundup.I pray God to bless you andclothe you with the Spirit of God. What a responsibility it is to hold this heavenly, thiseternal, this everlasting Priest-hood? And we shall have to give an account of it. Apostles, Seventies, High Priests, Elders, and all men who bear any portion of this Priesthood that has been given untous, will be held responsible for it un-til our spirits return unto God whogave them.I marvel sometimes, when I re-flect, why I am alive. I was goingto say that there is not a man liv-ing, scarcely, that I was acquainted with in Kirtland. A whole quorum of Apostles has been taken into the spirit world. But for some reason the Lord has preserved my life un-til the present day. And I sincerelydesire, in the remaining days I have to spend here, that I may do whatlittle good I can. I wish to magnifymy calling. I wish to do my duty. I wish to know the mind and willof God, and try to do it. I pray notonly that these blessings may begiven to me, but to all the Elders ofIsrael and the Latter-day Saints, which may God grant, for Christ'ssake. Amen. 
 God." We had a peg driven down,and it was nearly in the middle of theTemple as it stands to-day, which Temple was built without any regardto the spot designated by President Young at the time. On the 26th wewent to the top of a high point on thenorth of the city, which President Young named "Ensign Peak." We also visited the Hot and Warm Springs. On the 27th we drove tothe West Mountains, and visited theSalt Lake, President Young being thefirst man to dip his hand into thebriny water. We walked dryshod to the Black Rock and took a bath inthe lake. Afterwards preparations were made for laying out the city, and I with other brethren, assisted Presi-dent Young in laying out the ground and streets with chain and compass. He laid out a block of ten acres upon which to build a Temple, and citylots of one acre and a quarter, andstreets eight rods wide, all of whichhave been published by historians.President Young left Winter Quarters on the 7th day of April, accompaniedby seven other apostles and other men all told 143 men and three women. The apostles were Brigham Young,Heber C. Kimball, Wilford Woodruff, Geo. A. Smith, Willard Richards, Orson Pratt, Amasa Lyman, and EzraT. Benson. Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor arrived soon after, leadingcompanies of families. Orson Hyderemained at Kanesville. We traveledthe first 500 miles without any grass. With the exception of the little grainwe fed our animals, they lived entirely on the bark of cottonwood limbs and saplings which they knawed from the cottonwood we would lay before them for their night's meal. This companyof 143 men traveled 1,000 miles, making their roads and building theirbridges. In one instance we had to form a guard of a wedge shape for three days and nights to keep ourcompany from being trampled to death by an enormous herd of buffalothat had gathered from the mountainsand were migrating in a solid body tothe plains below. The herd was judged to be sixty miles in length, and numbered not less than one million.They were traveling east, and we weretraveling west. We were three days passing through the herd, and we allbreathed freer when we were clear ofthem. No other class of men will ever witness the same scene againupon the face of the earth. Brother Wm. C. A. Smoot, sen., got his horsesloose and mixed with the herd, and it was with great difficulty that we ob-tained them again.Notwithstanding our first care was to secure an abiding place, a home forthe people, we did not lose sight of other important matters. PresidentYoung contemplated at that early day the building of a railroad across thecontinent, and we marked out theroute which we thought the national road would take to unite the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.Brothers Orson Pratt and ErastusSnow entered the valley two or three days before the body of the pioneers;but where are those men to-day, andwhere is President Brigham Young and the apostles who accompanied him? All are in the spirit world, mingling with the martyred prophets,where they can plead for their breth-ren. Not one of them living to-day except myself, and but few of the pioneers remain. We have buried a whole quorum of twelve apostles since we entered these valleys of the moun-tains. The remnant of Zion's Camp, Mormon Battalion, and the pioneers, number but very few to-day. Thoseof us who remain will soon pass away,but our posterity lives and are num-bered in the Primaries, the SabbathSchools, and the Mutual Improve-ment Associations, and are this dayassembled in this great Tabernacle tocelebrate the arrival of the pioneersinto this great American desert, which to-day, through the blessing of Godand labor of the pioneers, is blossom-ing as the rose.This company of pioneers spent abouta month in this valley, during whichperiod we erected what is known as the Old Fort, surrounding three sides of the ten-acre block with an adobewall on the outside, and the east sidewith log cabins. We also arranged forthis fort to have four entrances, one on each point of the compass.Most of the pioneers returned to Winter Quarters, where they reached in the fall, making a journey of over 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 491PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFsaid: I feel thankful that I have lived and had the privilege of at-tending this fifty-ninth annual con-ference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is nearly fifty years since I was or-dained into the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the Lord has told us while occupying these posi-tions and holding the keys of the Kingdom of God, that whomsoever you bless shall be blessed, and whom-soever you shall curse shall be cursed. I have never seen a mo-ment in my life since I have been a member of this Church and King-dom when I felt like cursing any-body, and I would not wish to do sounless I was commanded of the Lord. I have had a desire tobless my friends, and at this time, when I have the right and privilege, I feel to bless my breth-ren, my counselors, my brethren of the Twelve Apostles; and I feel tobless in the name of the Lord also the Patriarchs, Presidents of Stakes, the High Councilors, and those who bear the Holy Priesthood, even the High Priesthood throughout the land of Zion. Likewise the Seven-ties, Elders of Israel who are called as messengers to the nations of the earth, the Bishopric, the lesser Priesthood, and all the Saints of God who dwell in our midst. I feel to bless the Primary Associations—our little children; I feel to bless the Sabbath schools, the teach-ers and pupils; the Mutual Improvement Associations, the Relief Societies, and all those or-ganizations which have been estab-lished by the hand of God and byHis power, His helps in the build-ing up and establishing of the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth. All these I feel to blessin the name of Jesus Christ and by virtue of the holy Priesthood, evenso, Amen.Brother Woodruff then pro-nounced the benediction. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.I do not know that I can make this congregation hear me, but Iwould like to make a few remarks.I will say that if this whole as-sembly could have their eyes opened to behold all the creations of God—the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the fish of the sea, and the fourteen hundred millions of people that inhabit this world, with every spear of grass and every flower—itis said you could find no two things alike. This has been represented many times by men concerning the creations of God. This eternal variety on the earth is no greater than that among the spirits who have dwelt in the presence of God in the eternal worlds and who have taken and will take tabernacles onthis earth. This variety has also been manifest in all the revelations that have been given to us concerning the children of men or the creations of God. So great has this variety been that it seems Lucifer, the son of themorning, a personage who was greatin the presence of God, rebelled against God and drew away with him one-third of the whole host ofheaven. They deserted the Lord and followed Lucifer. And I do not know how many were "astride the fence" and did not know which way to go; but I presume there were a good many of them. This variety has remained with the spirits in heaven and on the earth. The Lord revealed this principle to Father Abraham. He showed unto him the spirits that dwelt with Himand told Abraham that many of those spirits were more noble than others, and said unto him: "These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good." He also said to Abraham, "Thou art one of them, thou wast chosen before thou wast born." And the Lord blessed Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and thetwelve tribes of Israel, who sprangfrom Jacob. They all received their patriarchal blessings, and every one of those blessings has been fulfilled to the very letter as fast as the time would permit. From that day un-til the present the Almighty has made use of the seed of Abraham,

 560  THE DESERET WEEKLY.DISCOURSEDelivered by President Wilford Wood-ruff, at the General Conference,Sunday after noon, Oct. 6. 1889.The following passage from thesixty-eighth section of the Doctrineand Covenants was read by Presi-dent George Q. Cannon:My servant, Orson Hyde, was calledby his ordination to proclaim the ever-lasting gospel, by the Spirit of theliving God, from people to people, andfrom land to land, in the congrega-tion of the wicked, in their synago-gues, reasoning with, and expoundingall Scriptures unto them.And behold, and lo, this is an ensam-ple unto all those who were ordainedunto this Priesthood, whose missionis appointed unto them to go forth;And this is an ensample unto them, that they shall speak as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost,And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost,shall be scripture, shall be the will ofthe Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord,shall be the voice of the Lord, and thepower of God unto salvation:Behold this is the promise of theLord unto you, O ye my servants.President Woodruff then said: I have traveled over one hun-dred and fifty thousand miles preaching the Gospel to largeand small congregations, to saints and to sinners; and I havenever yet seen the day, on arising tomy feet, that I have known what I was going to say to the people. And this is the case with the Elders gen-erally in their ministrations. Youwho have attended the meetings ofthis Conference perceived that wecalled upon brethren from the rightand left to speak to us; and if youhave any discernment you certainlycan testify that they spoke by theSpirit and power of God.I have attended Conferences dur-ing my whole life, in company withthe Prophet Joseph, Oliver Cowdery,the witnesses of the Book of Mor-mon, with the first Twelve Apos-tles, all of whom are in the spiritworld, mingling with the Gods; andI have never attended a Conferencewhen I have felt better and beenmore edified in listening to the re-marks of the same number of men,than at this Conference. The Eldershave spoken by inspiration, and they have declared unto useternal truths. As I said last nightat our Priesthood meeting so I would remark here, no man that God ever made, beginning withFather Adam down through thehistory of the world, that has everbeen called to build up the King-dom of God, and preach the Gospel,has been able to perform that workonly by the Power of the HolyGhost; neither can any man do it today.  We are all dependent uponthe Holy Ghost. And what is theHoly Ghost? The testimony of theFather and the Son. It is one ofthe God-head—God the Father, Godthe Son, and God the Holy Ghost. Will the Holy Ghost deceive anyman? It will not. When a man speaks as he is moved upon by theHoly Ghost, it is the spirit of in-spiration; it is the word of God; it isthe will of God. It cannot lie; it cannot deceive. It leads into all truth and reveals to man the will ofhis Maker.Jesus instructed His disciples to take no thought what they shouldeat, or what they should drink. They were traveling without purseor scrip, as many of us have done in our time. The Lord knew they would have need of something toeat; and He knew that somebodywould be raised up to supply theirwants. He also instructed them totake no thought what they should saywhen having to appear before magis-trates and rulers; for the same should be given them the hour itwas needed.This is the condition of the Lat-ter-day Saints. The Apostle has said,"He hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the thingswhich are mighty; * * *and things which are not, to bring to naught things which are." Thishas been the case in the dealings ofGod with man of all ages; and it certainly is the case in this our day.When I look upon the ten thou-sand faces of Latter-day Saints be-fore me the present time; and whenI contemplate what God hath wrought in establishing this peoplein the midst of these mountain val-leys; and when I bring myself face to face with the wonderful age we live in, and sense the mighty responsibilities that restupon us, as watchmen uponthe walls of Zion, and as watchmen to this generation—whenI contemplate these things, if anyman under heaven feels his weak-ness, it is Wilford Woodruff. And in saying this of myself, I know Iam expressing the feelings of mybrethren associated with me in ref-erence to themselves, as Counselors,as well as the sentiments of theTwelve respecting themselves, andthose of every Elder of Israel who appreciates his calling in ChristJesus.We have been called from the plow, the plane and the anvil, andthe various avocations of life; andwithout preparation the Elders of this Church are sent forth, by com-mand of Almighty God, to preach to and warn the nations ofthe earth. Joseph Smith has been referred to by some of thespeakers, and their testimony of him is true. A greater prophetthan he, excepting Jesus Christ, Ido not believe ever lived. In sayingthis I give it as my own personal views. I don't believe God ever raised up a greater prophet, saveJesus himself. The dispensation hewas called to usher in is the great-est ever given to man; and it re-quired just as much a man to stand at the head of it—a man who was true to God and his brethren; who was aseer and revelator, and whose faithin God was such that he never wavered or doubted, but perseveredhimself and encouraged others to move forward in the great work be-fore them. The world called himilliterate and ignorant. Howeverthey might regard him, our testi-mony of him is that he was taught of God Himself and of the angels who visited him; and that he fulfilled certainrevelations and predictions referringto this age, as contained in the Bibleand other records of Divine truth. And, as has been stated during thisConference, he brought forth the Book of Mormon—the stick of Josephin the hands of Ephraim—in fulfill-ment of the testimony of Isaiah, translating that record through theUrim and Thummim, thereby reveal-ing to us the history of the early in-habitants of this Continent. That book informs us that two distinct nations inhabited this land, the founders of both of which were brought here bythe power of God from the easterncontinent, the first, known after-wards as the Jaredites, tracing theirorigin to the tower of Babel. They 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.President George Q. Cannon thenpresented the authorities to be votedon by the general assembly, asfollows:Wilford Woodruff, as Prophet,Seer and Revelator and Presidentof the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints in all the world.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFarose and spoke as follows:I wish to say to this assembly ofLatter-day Saints that there arethree vacancies in the Quorum of theTwelve Apostles, in consequence ofthe organization of the First Presi-dency. We have felt that it is timeto fill that quorum now, at this con-ference, and the people should beprepared for the presenting by theTwelve Apostles of such names asthey may feel by the Spirit of Godto be worthy and proper persons toreceive this ordination or to occupythis position. These Apostles areProphets, Seers and Revelators. Ihave confidence in them; I believethey have power to present suchthings as would be in accordancewith the will of God. They (theApostles) presented to me a list ofnames. I wish here to say, andI want it understood, that neithermyself, President George Q. Can-non nor President Joseph F. Smith,who are my counselors, pre-sented any of these names. We leftit with the Quorum of the Apostles.I became thoroughly satisfied thatthey had upon that list such namesas would be acceptable unto the Lord.We took those names and made it amatter of prayer, and the Spirit ofthe Lord manifested unto me thosewhom we should appoint. Theyhave all been accepted by theQuorum of the Apostles as well asthe Presi[d]ency of the Church. Ihave a reason for making these re-marks.After President Woodruff hadtaken his seat, President Cannon re-sumed the presentation of the au-thorties, submitting the names ofthe following three brethren for ap-pointment to the Apostleship, to fillthe three vacancies in the Quorumof the Twelve before referred to:Mariner W. Merrill, Anton HLund, Abraham H. Cannon.Counselors to the Twelve Apostles—John W. Young and Daniel H.Wells.The Counselors in the First Presi-dency and the Twelve Apostles, withtheir Counselors, as Prophets, Seersand Revelators.Patriarch to the Church: JohnSmith.First Seven Presidents of the Seventies: Henry Herriman, Jacob Gates, Seymour B.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    443PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S ADDRESS TO THE OLD FOLKS.IT is an established custom in Salt Lake City to give the old folks, those over seventy years of age, an outing each year, and entertain them with songs, speeches and refreshments. This year they were given a two days' outing, consisting of a trip to Saltair, a grand pavilion on the Great Salt Lake, some twelve miles from Salt Lake City, and a ride to Fort Douglas, a military post adjoining the city. Besides this, a concert was held for their entertainment in the Tabernacle, on June 22nd.President Wilford Woodruff, one of the few who has passed the ninetieth milestone of life, was on the program for an address, but being the sufferer from a bad cold, his address was a prepared one which was read by ElderDavid McKenzie. It was as follows:"My Dear Friends—I thank God that I have lived to see this day. I rejoice to behold the faces of so many of my friends gathered together in this great Tabernacle. We who have been upon this earth from seventy 
 Isaac and Jacob, in a great measure, to perform His work on the earth. Jesus Christ Himself, the Son of God and the Savior of the world, was a literal descendant of Abraham,through the loins of Judah. [##Matthew 1:1-16##]I will here say a few words in re-ference to the Prophet Isaiah. Isai-ah spoke and prophesied upon avery broad ground. In speaking of the judgments of God which wereto come upon great Babylon and the raising up of Cyrus to destroy Babylon, in fulfillment of the prom-ises which had been made, and also in speaking of the destruction of the wicked and their cities, he says: "But Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation;ye shall not be ashamed nor con-founded world without end." [##Isaiah 45:17##] That was the promise of God to Israel. And all the judgments of God that have ever followed Israel from the days of Father Abraham to this hour have come upon them through transgression.  The Jews caused Christ to be put to death, againstthe judgment of the Gentile judges who were in their midst. [##Matthew 27##] Moses told the Jews what would follow them. Jesus Christ did likewise. The Apostles also warned them of theevils that would come upon them if they turned away from the com-mandments of God. These things have been fulfilled to the very let-ter. For eighteen hundred years the Jews have been trampled under the feet of the Gentiles, and theyoke is upon them today. But the Rothschilds and other rich Jews are returning to rebuild Jerusalem, in fulfillment of the words of the an-cient prophets.Whenever and wherever God hasraised up prophets or a people, no matter who they were, the evil spirits, who are very numerous, have always sought to kill them. You cannot point me to a prophet or an apostle who has ever lived on the face of the earth that was popu-lar in his day. The people have always fought them. Jesus Christ certainly was a good man. He was the Savior of the world. He com-mitted no sin; yet all Jerusalem and Judea and the surrounding country were opposed to Him and fought Him until they put Him to death.I now say to the Latter-day Saints, you are of the house of Israel. Nearly all of you are of the tribe of Ephraim. You have been a mixed cake among the Gentiles. The Gospel of Christ found you and you have received it. You have been gathered to these valleys of the mountains. The Lord chose Joseph Smith to establish this Church and kingdom. He brought forth the blessings of the Gospel. He received the holy Priesthood fromthe angels of God. That Priesthood has been given to you. Why? You are the descendants of Israel, and God has called you and placed upon you this work, to warn the genera-tion in which you live, and if you do not do it, you will be under con-demnation. But are we popular? No. Shall we ever be? No, not in the generation in which we live. The Lord has chosen these Apostles and Prophets and Elders of Israel and laid upon themthe holy Priesthood, and we havebeen called to go forth with the ful-ness of the everlasting gospel and warn this generation. If we had not done it, we would have been under condemnation and the curse of God would have rested upon us.Latter-day Saints, you have no time to be divided. You have no time to forsake the Lord. You have no time to depart from doing the works of righteousness. If you do, the afflictions of the Lord will rest upon you, as they rested upon Israel in former days. The revela-tions of God declare this. The Bible declares that in the last days the God of heaven would set His hand to gather His people and to establish His Church and Kingdom,that Mount Zion might be built up and His People stand in holy places while His judgments overtook the world.We are here today. We profess to be Latter-day Saints, and we hold the Holy Priesthood. What Brother Geo. Q. Cannon has said to you istrue; you have never seen a day, you never will see a day, in time orin eternity, when you can get be-yond the need of the protection and care of God. You need it all the way through your lives. When our young men, or our old men, or our maidens, feel that they have arrived at a point that they are independent of the Lord, they will find that they are greatly mistaken. We are all here upon a mission. That mission is to build up Zion and to preach the gospel and warn the inhabitants of the earth of the judgments of which the heavens are full, and which are about to be poured out upon the earth. It is the lot of thiscongregation and of all people who now dwell on the face of the earthto live in the last day and generationbefore the coming of the Son of Man,in the which will be fulfilled thepromises of God concerning the winding up scene, the pouring out of the plagues, the opening of the seals and all those judgments which are to be poured out. These things will surely come to pass, in spite of all efforts of earth and hell. Therefore, I say, honor and serve God, and keep His command-ments. We shall soon go to the other side of the veil, where other generations have gone before us—the rich and the poor, the saint and the sinner, the president, the em-peror, the king, the judge, and allother men. We have been sent here upon a mission; and when you and I get through we will read our his-tory; it will be before us, and it will be before the Great Judge, who will decree righteous judgment upon allflesh.This is our condition today. I know this is the work of the Lord. I know the Lord has raised up a Prophet. I know He has given unto this Prophet and unto His servants, the Holy Priesthood, which is the power of God to ad-minister in all the ordinances of life and salvation, both for the liv-ing and the dead. We are held re-sponsible for the use we make of this Priesthood, and for the use we make of the blessings which Godhas given unto us. Therefore, brethren and sisters, let us look around ourselves. We have not yet got beyond the dictation and direction of the Lord. He is God, and there is none else. Hecreated this world. He created it tobe occupied by His children. But this eternal variety is here. Some men want to commit murder; somedelight in doing all manner of wickedness and abomination; while others do not take pleasure in this and look upon it as wrong. Thishas been so from one generation to another. These evil spirits are with us, and they make war againstthe Church of Christ and against the Priesthood: and our help, our sustenance, our defense, our refuge, and our salvation is in the God ofIsrael. As Brother Cannon has said, it is our duty to make our wants known there. If we do not do our duty, if we stray from the commandments of God, we shall be chastised.I pray God that those who have entered into covenant with the Lordand with one another will not forget their position; that they will not forget why they are here and wherethey came from, nor forget their duty to God and to one another. I pray God to bless us all, and to giveus His spirit to guide and direct us through our mission and probationhere in the flesh, that when we come into the presence of God and the Lamb and of those old patriarchsand prophets, and of our brethrenand sisters who have lived in this generation and have passed away, we may be satisfied with our lives and with our work and labor here, which may God grant, for Christ's sake. Amen. 
 2,000 miles, besides the labors per-formed while here in building a fort, laying out the city, and exploring theadjacent valleys.I wish to say a few words to themembers of the Sabbath Schools, and to all who are assembled in this Taber-nacle to-day to celebrate the arrival of the pioneers into this valley. It is not wisdom for us to occupy your timewith a long address upon an occasion of this kind; but I have referred to afew incidents of our peculiar journeyinto this barren desert, that you cankeep in mind the toil, the care, andthe hardships which your fathers en-dured in laying the foundation of the Zion of our God which is to be estab-lished in the mountains of Israel in fulfillment of the blessings the old Patriarch, Jacob, pronounced upon his posterity that should be fulfilled in the valleys of the everlasting hillsin the latter days; and upon theheads of the rising generation of theLatter-day Saints rests the responsi-bility of building up the kingdom of God upon the foundations which theirfathers have laid. And also of build-ing up a State in which shall dwellvirtue, temperance, industry, frugality, and honesty; a State which will do honor to the American Government, where wholesome laws shall be ad-ministered in equity and justice to all of its citizens according to the letter and spirit of the Constitution givenby inspiration of Almighty God to our forefathers.I feel to say to our children, honoryour father and your mother and your God, that your days may be long andprosperous in these valleys of themountains which the Lord your Godhath given unto you.That God may bless you all, and enable you to fulfill the object of your creation here on earth to the satisfac-tion of yourselves and your Creator, is the earnest desire of your friendand brother,WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  561flourished and became a mightypeople; but they turned from the right way of the Lord, and whenthey had ripened in iniquity they, like other nations of the earth, werefinally destroyed by the judgments of God. The other nation was known as Nephites and Lamanites, being named after the sons of Lehi,the head of the family who, bycommand of God, left their nativeland, Jerusalem, some four hun-dred years before Christ, and tra-veled by land, and in ships of their own construction, crossedthe great waters, and came to this land. They dwelt here for hundreds of years, and also be-came a great and mighty people, an outline of whose history is re-corded in that book. The interest-ing mission of the Savior to thepeople of this continent is also re-corded here; the establishing of the Church among the believing Ne-phites, and their labors in the workof perfection. And I may say the remains of some of the cities builtby these peoples have been dis-covered and written about by suchmen as Stephens and Catherwood and others; and doubtless much re-mains yet to come to light in corrob-oration of the testimony of this divine record.The Prophet Joseph not only per-formed this work, but organized the Church with prophets and apostles, elders, priests, teachers and deacons, as it was organized in the days of Jesus and His Apostles. And thereis a feature connected with theChurch as it exists today that is pe-culiar from all other dispensationsthat we have any account of; that is, nearly the whole body of its male members have received some portion of the Priesthood, until we have to-day in these mountains some twen-ty thousand men bearing either thePriesthood after the order of Aaron or Melchizedek. There is a reasonfor this. There never has been atime in all the dispensations of God to man, when there has been somuch need for the labors of the ser-vants of God as in this our day; andthe Lord, therefore, has called agreat number of men to bear the Priesthood, and directed them to go unto all nations, tongues and peoples, as He showed John the Reve-lator He would do in the last days, as recorded in the ##Revelation 14|14th chapter## of thebook of Revelations. And in ful-fillment thereof we have not only gone forth to the nations proclaim-ing this Gospel revealed to man bythe angel of God, but in further obedience to the divine command,have come out from Babylon, untilwe number some two hundred thou-sand gathered here. And by what power have we come here? Andwhy did you leave the States of this nation, England, Scotland, Ire-and, Wales, Norway, Sweden, Den-mark, Austria, Germany and othernations? You heard the Elders. They told you they had been sent by God and that they had the ful-ness of the Gospel to offer to man, and they explained to you the prin-ciples thereof. They told you therewas but one Gospel, and that God had never revealed but the one, theGospel that Paul referred to whenhe said, "Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other Gos-pel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8-9##] You be-lieved and obeyed, and gatheredwith the Saints. And what was it these Elders taughtyou? It was that you must have faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God; that you must repent of your sins and be baptized by immersion for remission of the same, and thenhave hands laid upon your head forthe reception of the Holy Ghost.And this Comforter, this Holy Spirit, you received, and it borewitness unto you that you had in-deed been initiated into the Churchof Christ. And if I were to call upon this congregation of Latter-day Saints today, and ask every man and woman who thus heard and obeyed, and who did receivethis testimony for themselves, to rise to their feet, how many do youthink would remain seated? Not many, if any. The fact that youare thus gathered here, and thatyou have these many years re-mained faithful to the cause you espoused, is evidence that you did receive and are still in possession of this testimony. And I would say, if there are present today any strangers who are not acquaintedwith the principles of our religion,let them gaze upon this congrega-tion of over ten thousand faces; let them travel through the settlements of the Saints northand south, and contemplate the work that has been accomp-lished in redeeming the earth andmaking it habitable, and then let them ask themselves the question,are not these people in earnest? Arethey not sincere? Are they deceiv-ers, these missionary Elders who have been the means of inducing the people of all lands to thus settleand make homes in these valleys? Do you believe in their works and their mission? You say no. But let me tell you, there is not an honestman upon the face of the earth ac-quainted with the history of theLatter-day Saints that can say thisat heart. And I testify to you, as Iwould to the whole world had I thepower to do so, that God has set Hishand to fulfil the word of the Lord as given in the Bible, the book of all books the Christian world pro-fess to believe in; the revelations of St. John, the predictions of Isaiah,Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Joel, Micah, and others contained within its sacredlids, who spoke of the great work ofthe last days; and I testify that theday has come which Daniel saw, the day referred to by him in his interpretation of Nebuchudnezzar's dream, when the God of heavenshould set up a kingdom whichshould never be distroyed.This Kingdom was represented tohim as a little stone cut out of the mountain without hands, whichstone smote the image, representing the different nations that then ex-isted and should exist, on the feet,breaking it to pieces; and it became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] Was Daniel a pro-phet? He was, and was highly favored of God because of his mighty faith. Isaiah saw our dayand time and was glad."Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into sing-ing, O mountains: for the Lord hathcomforted his people, and will havemercy upon his afflicted." What is the matter? The Lord is going tocomfort Zion; He is going to havemercy upon her afflicted ones. ButZion said, "The Lord hath forsakenme, and my Lord hath forgotten me." "Can a woman forget her sucking child?" saith the Lord."Yea, she may forget, but I will not forget thee. Behold, I have gravedthee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually beforeme." This refers to the building up of Zion in the last days; the gathering together of the people, preparatory to the coming of the Son of Man. [##Isaiah 49:13-16##]As far as constitutional liberty is concerned, I will say, the God of heaven has raised up our nation, asforetold by His Prophets genera-tions ago. He inspired Colum-bus, and moved upon him tocross the ocean in search of this continent. The world is acquainted with the history of his course; his pleadings with the courts of Europe, and his final triumph in findingsympathy in the King and Queen of Spain, who furnished the neces-sary means to make the exploration. It is also well known how our fore-fathers found a home and an asylumin this land from the hand of perse-cution, and how they planted herethe tree of liberty and jealously guarded it from the attempt of the mother country to uproot and de-stroy it. The hand of God was in all this; and it is through the inter-vention of His providences that we enjoy today the freest and most in-dependent government the world ever saw. And what was the object of this? It was to prepare the way for the building up of the Kingdomof God in this the last dispensationof the fullness of times; and as long as the principles of constitutional liberty shall be maintained uponthis land, blessings will attendthe nation. But wo unto those whofight against Zion, said the Lord. Ihave heard the Prophet Joseph Smith remark, that if he wereEmperor of the world, and had thepower to control the whole human family, he would sustain every man,woman and child in the enjoy-ment of their civil and religious rights, let their religion be what itmay. In saying this he expressedmy sentiments, and the feelings of this entire community. For Godhas given to every man individual agency, and He will hold him ac-countable for the use of this agency.And while we in our hearts and feelings accord to the whole worldthis blessing, we claim the same for ourselves. To obtain this and tosecure it to our children, we havestruggled; and we look forward withjoyful anticipation when it shall be beyond the power of man to drive it any more from the earth. Our feel-ings with regard to religious liberty have been manifested towards the religious denominations that have come among us. Nota single one of them can accuse us

XXXVIII.DISCOURSEDelivered by President Wilford Wood-ruff, at Springville, Tuesday Morn-ing, March 5th, 1889.REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.Brethren and sisters: I feel to say, God bless you. I am glad to meet with you and to have the privilege of once more bearing my testimony to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the Kingdom of God. What BrotherCannon has told you with regard tothe work of the Lord, is true.  I have traveled in my day a great many miles with the Prophet Joseph Smith. I once heard him say that if he were the emperor of the world and had control of the whole humanfamily, he would defend every man, woman and child in the en-joyment of their religion, no matter what their religion was, whether itwas true or false. He said they had a right to that privilege, and the exercise of that agency whichGod had given to the whole humanfamily. Those were his sentiments.They are my sentiments today.  TheRevelator, St. John, represented to us that there would be about sixhundred three-score and six differ-ent religions upon the earth in these last days—the number of the name that was spoken of by him. Today that number, I presume, is very nearly filled. The whole Christian world are as diverse in their viewsand principles of religion and roads to heaven or hell, as the stars arediverse in their position in theheavens. And while I would grantthis privilege that I have spoken of,to all mankind, I claim the same privilege for myself and for all our people. We have a right to the en-joyment of our religion and belief, and to practice the same on the earth; and all other sects and partieshave the same right.Inasmuch as I claim this, I wantto give some of my views and tell you my feelings with regard to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. To com-mence with, I will quote the wordsof the Apostle Paul. You are doubt-less familiar with Paul's history,and know what a persecutor of theSaints he once was, and how hebecame converted to the truth; and his conversion was so thorough and complete that he finally laid downhis life in defense of the Gospel ofChrist. That same Paul said:"Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel un-to you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."That was a strong declaration; and to make it more emphatic, he repeated it.Now, brethren and sisters, and friends, that Gospel which Paultaught is what I believe in. It is what I have believed in since I was old enough to read the New Testa-ment. My belief in that Gospel was so strong that I never joined any sect or denomination on the earthuntil I heard a man preach to me 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFdelivered the following discourse:My brethren and sisters and friends:By way of introduction I desire to saythat I feel to thank God and all myfriends for the blessing I enjoy at this time—for the privilege, once more, ofentering this Tabernacle and beholding the faces of the Latter-day Saints.And I feel a good deal as Mark Antony did when he went to buryCaesar. "I come to bury Caesar," saidhe, "not to praise him." I come to see the Latter-day Saints, but not to preach to them. You haveplenty of Apostles and Elders topreach the word of the Lord unto you.But I have long desired to again enterthis Tabernacle of the Lord and see the Latter-day Saints. It has beensome three years, I think, since I havemet with the Saints of God in thishouse; and I will tell you how I feltabout coming to Conference. I felt that it would not be doing our greatand mighty nation any harm—a nationof sixty millions of people—for two orthree old men, seventy-five or eightyyears of age, to come into this Taber-nacle and look at the Latter-day Saints, and at the faces of their wivesand children. I do not know that I have a wife or child here. If I have,they will be able to see how old I havegrown since we last met. Some of ushave tried to keep the law to such anextent that we have almost forgotten how our wives and children look. I feel, however, to say, God bless theMarshal and officers of the governmentas far as they can exercise mercy,charity and humanity toward the Latter-day Saints in ful-filling their duty as officers of the government. I feel thankful to-day for this privilege, and I feel atpeace with all mankind. I am atpeace with all my friends. As to my enemies, I do not know that I have any. If I have, I hope that we may beat peace upon the principles of theGospel of Christ, of righteousness and of truth.Now, with regard to preaching toyou, my brethren and sisters, that isa subject I have thought very little about. I have preached this Gospelfor some fifty-four years, and havelearned by experience a great whileago that it is no use for an Elder in Israel to decide in his mindwhat he is going to say to the Saintsof God. This is the way I feel to-day. And I will say this, that there aretimes in a man's life when he cannot help reflecting upon the past. That is my condition to-day. Since I haveentered this Tabernacle, and looked upon this congregation, my mind has reverted to my life fromthe time I became a mem-ber of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and this engen-ders in my bosom some very solemn reflections. Fifty-four years ago thislast spring I traveled a thousand mileswith the Prophet Joseph, and his brother Hyrum, Brothers Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, George A.Smith, and a great many other men—some 205 in all—mostly Elders inIsrael—for the redemption of our brethren—to assist them in the midstof persecution. Our Prophets andPatriarchs, many of them, have passed away. They are on the other side of the vail. Since we came into these val-leys forty years ago the twenty-fourth of last July—I drove President Younginto this valley in my carriage, and he was sick at the time—eleven of the Apostles have passed away. They arein the spirit world mingling with the Gods, where they can plead for theirbrethren. These are reflections thatrest upon my mind as I occupy this stand where I have met day after dayand year after year with these noble men. President John Taylor, who was our last President and Apostle has also taken his departure. The last time I was in this house I met herewith him. His work is finished. He has gone into the spirit world, where we shall all go very soon. Some-times, in my reflections, I feel some-what lonesome when I think these matters over. I feel as if I had lived two or three generations since thedays of Kirtland and Nauvoo, or sincethe establishment of this Church andKingdom with which I have been as-sociated for so many years. I realizemyself that I shall not dwell a great while upon the earth. I do not ex-pect to dwell a great while longer with the Latter-day Saints. Ihave lived to the age of four scoreyears, and when I contemplate themultitude that has passed away sincewe entered these valleys of the moun-tains, I can only expect to take myturn with the rest. But I will say this.I rejoice in the Gospel of Jesus Christ; I rejoice in the work of God; I rejoicein the principles of eternal life, light and truth, which have been revealed tothe Latter-day Saints.We have been called as a people topass through a great deal of afflictionin our day and time. But this eternal truth remains on earth and in heaven—that the God of Israel has set His handto establish His Church and Kingdom upon the earth, and to fulfill the reve-lations contained within the Holy Bible, the Old and New Testament, aswell as other records which have beengiven concerning the last dispensationand fulness of times.We are all of us, brethren and sis-ters, dependent upon God our Heav-enly Father for all our blessings, both temporal and spiritual. Indeed, whileI contemplate our progress, our ad-vancement, and the signs of the timesin which we live, I feel that we, asLatter-day Saints, should try to fullyrealize and comprehend our responsi-bility before God, before each other,before the heavens, and before the earth.I have for a long time had a desire tomingle with the Latter-day Saints, and to take part in their institutions—theSabbath schools, the Mutual Improve-ment Associations, and with the var-ious organizations of the Church. But for several years I have been la-boring in other portions of the coun-try, and have been deprived of theprivilege of meeting with the Saints sofar as this portion of the Territory is concerned.I have desired from my youth up tobecome acquainted with the truth ascontained in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. From my youth up I have hada desire to live and find the people ofGod on the earth. I have lived to see that day. I have lived to see Proph-ets, Apostles and inspired men. I have associated with them for many yearsof my life. This has been a greatpleasure to me, and a great satisfac-tion to my own spirit.And I desire to say to the Latter-day Saints, that we should remember that we are sent here on a mission; that we have been born in the flesh inthis last dispensation of the fulnessof times. We have been called tolabor in the vineyard of the Lord,called to preach the Gospel, called to warn the nations of the earth, andmany of them have been warned. Wehave traveled by land and by sea; havevisited many foreign nations, also al-most every part of our own nation,and some of us are drawing our mis-sions to a close.I have a desire that the Latter-day Saints should try to live their religion,and endeavor to do what is right; thatthey should have faith in God, and inthe revelations of God, and in theprinciples which have been revealed to the Saints for the salvation of the hu-man family.We have a great many organizationsin the Church and Kingdom of God,and have had almost from the be-ginning. They are so organized that all men and women, whether young or old, have a place of useful-ness. We should try to improve ourtime, our talents and our opportunities while we are here upon the earth. I realize that this world is not our abid-ing place. We have an evidence of this every day of our lives. We arecalled to bury our Prophets, Apostles,Elders, fathers, mothers, wives andchildren, all of which shows us thatwe have no lease of life. We should therefore improve our time to-day.I have felt to give the Latter-daySaints my faith and prayers in all their labors and exertions to build up the kingdom of God. I try to build it upto the best of my ability in accordancewith the light and truth and knowledgewhich God has given me.This is the first time that I have en-deavored to speak in public for a goodwhile. I have not been laboring in themidst of congregations like this. I have just passed through a week of sickness, which laid me prostrate. Ifeel the effects of it in my lungs, and inmy system, yet I feel all right in my spirit. I felt as though I desired tolook upon the faces of the Latter-daySaints, and hear the testimonies of my brethren. They have heardmy testimony in years past.I have the same testimonyto bear to-day. I bear record beforeGod, angels and men, that the fulnessof the everlasting Gospel has been re-vealed in these last days through the Prophets of God; and that JosephSmith was raised up by the power of God as a Prophet, Seer and Revelator. He laid the foundation of this Church and Kingdom in its perfection, as it is at the present time. He brought forththe record as contained in the Book of Mormon, in fulfillment of the predic-tions of the Prophets of God; also the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, which containsthose grand and solemn revelations,and those principles of eternal truth, so precious to the Latter-day Saints.These things are true. We should study them; lay them up in our hearts, and practice them in our lives. This is the kingdom of God and the Churchof Jesus Christ. The Lord Almighty has set His hand to carry out the great programme of the last dispensationand fulness of times. If this had notbeen true, Utah to-day would havebeen in all probability a desert as wefound it in 1847, when first we camehere. God has been watching over thispeople, and will continue to watch so long aswe continue to do our duty. So long a[s] we humble ourselves before the Lord, so long as we keep His command-ments, so long will the hand of God beover the Latter-day Saints; Zion willarise; Zion will be clothed upon bythe power of God. The Lord is watch-ing over her; the heavens have been watching over this people, and havebeen from the beginning. We have theblessings of God with us. They are manifest in our temporal and spiritualaffairs.As I said in the beginning of my re-marks, I realize that the voices of those we were accustomed to hear inthe past are hushed in death. We shall hear them no more. The rest of us will follow in their train. We shall all pass away in our time, and wehave a long eternity before us in theworld to come. Those that have passed away have closed their work here and are laboring to-day on theother side of the vail.You have had laid before you, dur-ing this Conference, some things per-taining to the redemption of our deadand some things in regard to the [build-]ing of temples. These, brethren andsisters, are important works. Theyare works which we do for others that they cannot do for themselves. This is what Jesus Christ did when He laiddown His life for our redemption, be-cause we could not redeem ourselves.We have fathers and mothers andkindred in the spirit world, and [we]have a work to perform in their [behalf].As an individual I have had great [in-]terest in this work of redeeming thedead, and so have my brethren andsisters. This is a labor we must [con-]tinue as far as we have opportunity. This principle was taught by [the]Apostle Paul. He asks, "If the [dead]rise not at all, why are they then [bap-]tized for the dead?" This is a [work] that rests upon the Latter-day Saints.Do what you can in this [life,]so that when you pass to the other side of the vail [your] fathers, mothers, relatives and friends will bless you for what you have done,and inasmuch as you have been in-struments in the hands of God in [pro-]curing their redemption you will berecognized as Saviors upon Mount Zion in fulfilment of prophecy.I hope that our institutions—[those]that have been referred to in our Epistle—the Relief Societies, SundaySchools, Mutual Improvement Asso-ciations, etc., will continue to do good. They have done a great [deal of]good, and still have the power to domore. These institutions [belong] to the organizations of the [Church] of Jesus Christ of Latter-day [Saints.] The brethren and sisters should [con-]tinue to labor in them in behalf [of the]rising generation of this people. [The]Mutual Improvement Assoc[iations]are good schools in which to [prepare]our young men for the [vineyard of] Christ. So also are the various [quo-]rums of the Priesthood, and we [should] all labor to the best of our ab[ility to] fulfill the duties devolving upon us.I feel the effect of my sickness[; I feel]it upon my lungs, and do not think [it] necessary to continue my rema[rks. I]am glad to see you, and say God [bless]you, and I pray that God may [pour out] His Spirit upon you, that we may [mag-]nify our calling, do our duty, keep [the]commandments of God, so that [when]we get through our work we [may be]satisfied with our history. [I]feel to bless this cong[regation],as far as I have the [right] and privilege to bless, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The La[tter-]day Saints have been trying to do [their]duty, but there is room for all to [im-]prove; let us walk uprightly and [labor] for the truth, [an]d for the [inspiration]of Almighty God to assist us in [all we]endeavor to accomplish. I [pray our]Heavenly Father to uphold and [sus-]tain you, to bless you and your [fami-]lies, to bless you as husbands [and] wives and children and as Latt[er-day]Saints, or any other capacity in [which] we are called to act. This is my [prayer]in the name of Jesus Christ, [amen.]

 562 THE DESERET WEEKLY.of doing anything to hinder them in their labors by way of establish-ing themselves among us; on the other hand, we have opened our doors to them; they have occupied our public stands until they have had meeting houses of their own. We have never had a fear that our people or our children would becaptivated by their doctrine or con-verted to their religion; if theyhave a single truth which we have not,we want it, for it is truth we are after. This Church has been or-ganized now nearly sixty years. It certainly has been like the littlestone cut out of the mountain with-out hands. [##Daniel 2:44-45##] It has withstood all theopposition that has been aimedagainst it; and it will remain firm and immovable, fulfilling the desti-ny marked out for it, until the winding up scene. Zion will arise, clothed with the glory of God, nomatter what we may have to pass through. We are in the hands of God, and so are all men and na-tions; and if this is the work of God—and we say it is—He will bear it off triumphant.Brother George Q. Cannon in hisdiscourse this morning referred tothe different laws which governman, and the different glories that attend their observance. And Iwould say, show me a nation or people and I will tell you their fu-ture condition by the laws whichgovern them. All the creations of God are governed by law; and allblessings are predicated upon the observance of law. Opposition to the laws of God commenced in thecouncils of heaven at the time one-third of the heavenly hosts werecast out; and they are here upon theearth still opposing the work of God.They are without tabernacles; theynever had bodies, and that is thecurse visited upon them. Thosewho did not rebel were permitted to take tabernacles. The war thatcommenced at that time is still be-ing waged, and the struggle will con-tinue until Christ shall come to as-sume the reigns of government.There have been very few people in any age of the world ready to receive the Gospelwhen presented to them. In thedays of Noah only eight souls be-lieved on him, although he and his sons preached to the anti-deluvianworld a hundred and twenty years. [##Genesis 6:3##] [##Moses 8:18-27##]In consequence of their having be-come ripened in iniquity, the Lord determined to destroy them from the face of the earth. Enoch appearedin his day as the representative ofGod, and succeeded in raising up aChurch who so far perfected them-selves in the ways of the Lord asto be worthy of translation. They, we are told, will return to the earth with Christ and the Church of theFirst Born, when His Saints uponthe earth shall be prepared to meetHim. [##Moses 7##] In the days of Jesus and theApostles, comparatively few be-lieved on them, and the opposition was so strong against them that they were all, excepting one, put to death. That was a day of sacrifice;the time had not then arrived forthe Lord to establish His Kingdom.The consequence was that theChurch fled to the wilderness, andthe Priesthood was taken home tothe Paradise of God, where it re-mained until the restorationthrough the Prophet Joseph Smith.We have at present about twohundred thousand people in these mountains who have received the Gospel, out of the millions that now inhabit the earth, and it seems, inconsequence of the unpopularity of the Gospel, that we are under the necessity of passing through moreor less persecution. We have these things to meet, as other men have met them. In ancient times theApostles were ready to lay downtheir lives for the truth's sake. They knew that Jesus Christ wasthe Son of God, and that they hadbeen called to and endowed withthe Priesthood of heaven. Are weany better than they? Are the Apostles of this day any better thanthose of former days? If God wereto require it at our hands that our testimony be sealed byour blood, I believe there isnot a single member of the Council of the Twelve but whatwould be ready to make the sacri-fice. Why? Because we, like the former day Apostles, know for our-selves that Jesus is the Christ, theSon of the living God, and that weare His servants. Whatever sacri-fices the Lord may require at thehands of this people, will be met bythe people. But ours is not a day of sacrifice. Our special calling is to build up Zion, and prepare thepeople to stand in holy places whilethe judgments of the Lord are being poured out upon the wicked. And whatever may be before us we must meet in the fear of our God, believ-ing that He will deliver us in Hisown due time. The Lord, for our encouragement, has told us that Zion shall not be moved out of her place. But if we do not do our part, as the brethren have said who havepreached to us this Confer-ence, we shall be chastised. This is my testimony to the Latter-daySaints.In reflecting upon these things Ihave a great deal of sympathy for those who array themselves against us, as I have for the Jews who op-posed the Savior and His Apostles. When upon the cross suffering theagonies of a cruel death, Christ ex-claimed, "Father, forgive them, forthey know not what they do." [##Luke 23:34##] Whydid the Savior feel thus towards those who opposed him? Because He had clearly before his mind theresults of their acts; that they wereonly heaping coals of fire upon theirown heads; that all He had predicted concerning them would sooner orlater overtake them; which certain-ly has been the case.The Lord is again calling uponthe human family to repent of theirsins. And while in the pursuit of their calling some of our brethrenhave been called upon to lay downtheir lives for the work of God. What will be the result of the rejec-tion of the Gospel by this genera-tion? The answer has been writtenby St. John, by Isaiah and has beenreiterated by the revelations of Godthrough the Prophet Joseph. Woeunto them, says the Lord, that fightagainst Zion; woe unto all nationsthat continue in their iniquities; they have reason to weep for them-selves and their posterity.To the Latter-day Saints I wouldsay, be ye faithful in keeping the commandments of God the little time we have to remain here. Weare as much upon a mission to thisgeneration, as the Prophets whichhave preceded us were to the gener-ations in which they lived. We have our day; they had theirs. Asthey have gone to render an ac-count of their stewardship, so we shall follow, and will be held to an-swer for the deeds done in the body, and the manner in which we shall have used the talents entrusted to us. Brethren and sisters, be trueand faithful, and keep inviolate the covenants you have entered into, that we may be worthy of eternallife, the greatest of all the gifts of God to man.I rejoice in meeting with so manyof the Latter-day Saints in Confer-ence; and I have rejoiced in listen-ing to the testimonies of the Elders.I have often said in my boyhood, Iwished I could see an Apostle or some one that was able to teach me the same Gospel I had read of in the New Testament. But I couldnever find no man that could teach those doctrines; it was said they have been done away. They were done away, it is true, but through the un-belief of the children of men. Butthey are with us. The Kingdom of God is here, and the Lord will sus-tain it. And I can bear record asmy brethren have, that this king-dom will stand; and that the Zion of God will remain upon the earthuntil Jesus shall come to receive usunto himself. And my prayer is that you and I, and all this people, may be true and faithful, workingwith an eye single to the glory of God, for the building up of Zion,and the establishing of His king-dom upon the earth; and when wego to the other side of the veil, we can there assemble with all thosewho have kept the celestial law, and honored the Holy Priesthood, from Father Adam down to ourday, and with them receive our in-heritance, and have part in themorning of the first resurrection,with our wives and children, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters,each in the family organization in the Celestial World. Amen.

 444 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.to ninety years and upward have passed through one of the most interest-ing generations of the children of men. What marvelous changes haveoccurred in our lifetime! We see things to-day and look upon them with-out wonder that in our early days would have been considered miraculous.When I was a small boy we had just emerged from under the blue laws of Connecticut—to greater freedom of thought and action. The ducking-stool and other forms of punishment akin to it had been laid aside.Women were no longer hanged or burned at the stake as witches. Greater religious liberty was enjoyed. Women were allowed to kiss their children, husbands their wives, on the Sabbath day, without being punished for it.If a boy took an ear of corn from the field, although even then he might be punished for it, he was not in danger of being sold as a slave, as in former days. The improved condition of things had just been brought about when I came into the world. But greater and more wonderfulchanges have been accomplished since that time. In my boyhood every acre of grain was cut with a sickle in New England. The first advance made in that direction was when the hand cradle came into use. Thereaper and the binder were never dreamed of in those days. If such things had been brought into the wheatfields then, the people of the land would have almost thought the millennium had come. And there has been rapid advancement in almost every department of life."I need not take up your time in detailing the many changes and improvements that have been made. We live to-day amid the won-derous powers of steam and electricity, by which such marvelous thingsare being accomplished. All these things have been brought about in our day, and I feel to thank God for what He has done for the children of men in blessing them as He has done. Mankind have great cause for thankful-ness to our Father in heaven because of the many blessings He has be-stowed upon them in this day and generation."We who live in Utah have especial cause to thank and praise His holy name for the blessings we enjoy. I have spent fifty years in these valleysof the Rocky Mountains, and have passed through all the phases of a territorial government until we have arrived at full statehood, and I feel it a great privilege to meet with so many of my friends and citizens of the State of Utah, and I consider it proper here to make some reference toour arrival as pioneers, and the commencement of our labors in this greatAmerican desert. And I should be recreant in my duty and justly place myself under strong reproof did I not give the honor and glory to our great prophet, seer, revelator and pioneer, President Brigham Young, who, under God, laid the foundation of redeeming this great, barren Americandesert from its sterility into the fruitful and noble State of Utah as wefind it to-day. President Young was inspired to come here, and he wasinspired to work after he got here, and when Samuel Brannan, who took the ship Brooklyn from New York to San Francisco, loaded with Latter-day Saints, came to this barren country and ment with the pioneers, he looked upon the desolation and barrenness, and tried with all the power he had to persuade President Young not to stop here, but to go on to California. I heard President Young give his answer to Samuel Brannan

 450 THE DESERET WEEKLYthat Gospel. He held the Priest-hood, and he taught me the same Gospel that Paul taught. As many of you may have heard me remarkbefore, I went to Sabbath school, inmy boyhood, under Dr. Porter, in Farmington, Connecticut. He and Dr. Haws, of Hartford, Conn., were Presbyterian divines, and were considered great men in that day. In that Sabbath school I read the New Testament. I learned verse after verse and chapter after chap-ter. What did the Testament teach me? It taught me the Gos-pel of life and salvation; it taught me a Gospel of pow-er before the heavens and onthe earth. It taught me that the organization of the Church consist-ed of Prophets, Apostles, Pastorsand Teachers, with helps and gov-ernments. What for? "For the per-fecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry: for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God,unto a perfect man, unto the meas-ure of the stature of the fulness of Christ." These are the things which I learned, and theymade an impression upon me. I believed in them; yet I had neverheard them taught by any clergy-man or divine upon the earth. In my early manhood I attended the meetings of almost every denomina-tion there was. On one occasion I attended one of those great meet-ings which were sometimes held inConnecticut, at which forty or fifty ministers of various denominations were gathered together. They prayed for a pentecostal season and for a good many other things. Atthis meeting permission was given for anybody to make remarks. I was quite young then. I arose and stepped into the aisle, and I said to that body of ministers: "My friends, will you tell me why you don't contend for the faith once de-livered to the Saints? Will you tellmy why you don't contend for thatGospel that Jesus Christ taught, and that His Apostles taught? Why do you not contend for that religion thatgives unto you power before God, power to heal the sick, to make the blind to see, the lame to walk, and that gives you the Holy Ghost and those gifts and graces that have been manifest from the creation of the world? Why do you not teach the people those principles that theancient Patriarchs and Prophets taught while they were clothed with the revelations of God? They hadthe administrations of angels; theyhad dreams and visions, and con-stant revelation to guide and directthem in the path in which theyshould walk." The presiding eldersaid: "My dear young man, youwould be a very smart man, and avery useful man in the earth, if youdid not believe all those foolish things. These things were given to the children of men in the dark ages of the world, and they were given for the very purpose of en-lightening the children of men in that age, that they might believe in Jesus Christ. Today we live in theblaze of the glorious gospel light, and we do not need these things."Said I: "Then give me the dark ages of the world; give me thoseages when men received these prin-ciples."There is where I stood in my youth. I did not believe that these gifts and graces were done away,only through the unbelief of the children of men. They were done away when men rejected the law of the Gospel of Jesus Christ; turned away from the Kingdom of God, built up altars to Baal, and soughtto carry out principles of their own. And the earth remained in that con-dition until the Lord raised up a Prophet in these last days. Heraised up Joseph Smith, who laid the foundation of this Church and Kingdom. And from that day un-til the present, whenever any one has embraced the Gospel of Christand lived that religion, the gifts and blessings of that Gospel have been bestowed upon them. And this will be so unto the end.I have traveled many thousands of miles, at home and abroad,preaching the Gospel of Christ to my fellow-men; and, in my experi-ence, I have never known a man or woman who, when they received the Gospel with honest hearts and were baptized, did not receive a tes-timony for themselves.  While in England, in 1840, I was inspired ofthe Lord to go to Herefordshire. There had never been any Elders in that part of the country. When I arrived there I found about six hun-dred people called United Brethren. They had broken off from the Wes-leyan Methodists. They sought for those ancient gifts that I have been speaking about. They had beenpraying to God to open the way be-fore them. What was the conse-quence? All of them, except one, including forty-five preachers, were baptized in thirty days. They re-ceived the Gospel, and the gifts and graces followed them.As I said before, these are theprinciples that I believe in. And Iwill say here that this same Gospelwas with Father Adam, with Noah, with Enoch, and with all the an-cient patriarchs and prophets. There has been no change. And I say, as a servant of God, there is nochange in the eternal and everlast-ing Priesthood. It is without be-ginning of days or end of years. Itis from eternity unto eternity. By the power of that Priesthood, God, our Eternal Father, has organized all worlds, and redeemed all worlds that have ever been redeemed. By that same Priesthood men have ad-ministered on the earth in the or-dinances of the Gospel of Christ. There is no change to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, nor to one of the or-dinances thereof. And whenever that Gospel is offered to the children of men, it is by the power of thePriesthood. No man who has everbreathed the breath of life, since God made the world, has ever had the power to go forth and ministerin one of the ordinances of the Gos-pel of Christ, without that Priest-hood; and no man ever will. This may not be believed by many of the inhabitants of the earth; but it is true.We have been gathered to these valleys of the mountains by thepower and inspiration of God. We might have gone forth and preached till we had become as old as Methu-selah, and if the power of the Al-mighty had not attended that preaching, Utah might still have been a desert. But the Spirit of Godbore record to the teachings of the Elders of Israel, and the honest inheart and meek of the earth re-ceived the Gospel and gathered to these valleys.  This is in fulfill-ment of the revelations of God. John the Revelator, in his vision on the Isle of Patmos, saw "another an-gel fly in the midst of heaven, hav-ing the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##] Those words have been fulfilled. The angel ofGod has visited the earth and deliv-ered the fulness of the Gospel untothe inhabitants thereof, and they are receiving it. By the power of that Gospel you left your homes and cameto these mountains of Israel.Now, Paul says that if we preach any other gospel than that which he taught, we should be accursed. [##Galatians 1:8##] The first principle in that Gospel is faith in Christ as the Savior of the world.

 89each individual Church, but the whole number of the Churches connectedwith the Bran Green and Gadfield Elm, and the Froome Hill Conferences, together with a small Branch of 12 Mmebers, 1 Priest, and 1 Teacher at Little Garway, is 33 Churches; 534 Members; 75 Officers, viz.---10 Elders,52 Priests, and 13 Teachers; and for the comforting of the Saints, and withheartfelt gratitude to our Heavenly Father, we would say, that it is less than four months since the fulness of the gospel was first preached in this region,which is proof that God is beginning to make a short work in these last days.W. WOODRUFFLATE FROM AMERICAManchester, July 13, 1840. TO THE EDITOR OF THE STAR.Dear Brother,Having just received a letter from Mrs. Woodruff, I make a fewextracts, to be inserted in the Star, if you think proper. --W. WOODRUFF.Montrose, Iowa Territory, North America,May 4, 1840.My dear Companion,The Conference held in Com-merce on the 6th of April, was at-tended with much interest. More than 70 were baptised, many elders ordained, and much business trans-acted. Elder O. Hyde and John E.Page, started on their mission, soonafter the Conference, to visit the Jews. They go first to the Jews in New York, and then on to Palestine. They will call upon you in England,as it will be on the way.The work is rolling on in thiscountry with a greater rapidity than ever before since the foundation of the Church. There was an Indian, his wife, and daughter, baptised in Commerce a few days since; theycame some hundreds of miles to be-come acquainted with the work; theybelieved and embraced it joyfully. They said every word of the Book of Mormon was true. He was an in-terpreter to six tribes, and he said every one of his brethren would re-ceive it; he knew it would be so.Two Elders, with their families, have gone out among the Indians on a mission. Doctor Galland has justreturned from his mission, (I think he started just before you left Mont-rose,) and has brought 60 familieswith him,and expects, it is said, 200 families more soon.Commerce is building up surpri-singly; the emigration there is said tobe much greater than it ever was in Caldwell County.I trust that you obtain the "Times and Seasons," as the Editors said they were forwarding them to each of the Travelling Council. From those papers you will learn of our Brethren's success in this country, and many things more correctly than I can in-form you by writing. There has been must destruction of shipping in this country during the past season. Since the destruction of Natchez bya whirlwind, news has reached us thatNew Orleans was covered with tenfeet of water, and that it was still rising. It is said that the Indians have been into two counties in Mis-souri, and demanded and obtainedmoney, as a kind of tax for the land; and that there are many fears enter-tained by the Missourians concerning the Indians.The Rev.
