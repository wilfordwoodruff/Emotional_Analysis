 month, exerting his influence in our behalf.Do not be surprised to learn that this Union maybe shaken to its centre before the close of the presentsession. The South is determined that the "vexedquestion" of slavery shall be disposed of, and intheir own way, and the North seem equally determin-ed not to yield an inch. One Southern ^Senator^ said to menot long since "ninety nine to one but the Union willbe disolved" Another Southern Senator told me that just before New Year that this question was now tobe settled, and was to take precedence of all otherbusiness—The South have been caucusing, but they have not been able to agree among themselves. They can-not all be brought to unite on Mr Calhoun or onany other man as their leader. In compliance withan ivitation I visited Col Benton, who was quitefriendly, and said it was clear that we aught to havea territorial government. I have also had an inter-view with Mr Calhoun who is a very agreeable andaffable man, and remarked that we should havethe same chance as other territories. When our memorial & consti-tution were presented in the Senate, Gen. Cass came to meand said, "I shall go for a state, your folks can managea state as well as anybody else". William Smith's memorial hasprevented me from seeing Mr Clay and Mr Webster whichhowever I shall do very shortly. I have an excellent littletrait by Brother Parley, which contains a synopsis ofour faith and Doctrine, which I distribute, and preach tomembers of Congress and others whenever a favorable opportunitypresents itself--I visit Mrs McLean, the lady of one of the judgesof the Supreme Court of the United States, once a week to instructher in the principles of our faith and doctrine. She has readthe Voice of Warning & Brother Spencer's Letters, with which shehas expressed herself highly gratified. She is now reading theBook of Mormon, & a little work entitled the Book of Mormon proved.  She hasa Spirit of inquiry, and her interest in the work is increasing.[Sideways text]Remember me to Sister Woodruff, and accept for yourself theassurances of your friend; J. M.

 Washington City March 22, 1850Dear Brother,I hope you will excuse my delay in replying to your last favor, my time since its reception has been very much occupied. Ourapplication for a government over the valley ofthe Great Salt Lake and the adjacent region,has given me many anxious moments since myarrival in Washington. There is not a shadowof a doubt that we shall not be admitted into the Union as a State. But the Hon Truman Smithhas proposed to me a plan for a territorial govern-ment, which authorises us to elect our own officers,and the Central Government to pay their saleries.This would do admirably well, Judge Douglasshas proposed a plan somewhat similar, whichis to legalize our present constitution and formof government—Either would entitle us to adelegate in Congress, but not Senators—It is how-ever exceedingly doubtful whether Congress canbe induced to grant us such a government.If we get but an ordinary territorial government,I entertain but faint hopes, from my knowledge 
 of men and measures here, that the Presidentwould nominate such officers as we wouldelect, and if he did the Senate would notconfirm them, and if they did, they would atany moment be liable to be removed, andwould almost certainly be when the presentincumbent of the Presidency goes out of office.There are already hungry office hunters here who are seeking for the offices in the event thatwe get a territorial government, and if somewhippersnappers or broken down politiciansshould be sent out, who would not be acceptable to us, to tyranize over us, we should certain-ly be brought into collison with the GeneralGovernment, and if a common territorial government be given us, and we should not acceptit, it would be rebellion, and we shouldbring down upon us the indignation ofthe whole nation, and measures would betaken to enforce it, and it is superfluous forme to tell you what the consequences would be.For these reasons I have, after much anxious reflection and serious deliberation, come almostto the determination, If I find that Congress will 
 not grant us such a form of government aswill authorize us to elect our own officers,to withdraw our application for a government,at least temporarily, until I can see the authoritiesin the valley, or hear from them. We can getalong very well with our provisional govern-ment, until our population is sufficient toentitle us to admission into the Union as a State,and this would be carrying out the President'swishes. Now, dear brother, I want youto [tel]l me candidly what you think ofthis matter, and whether I should, in your judgment, in the absence of instructions fromthe valley, be warrented in adopting this courseI need not add that as early an answer as you canmake will be acceptable—Brother Babbitt hastaken his departure for the west.Your friendJohn M. Bernhisel

 Historian's office.G. S. L. City April 1 1857.Brother George A. SmithDear Sir,I take pleasure in announcing to you that the Eastern mail arrived on the 24th Ulto., bringing 28 brass lock sacks, having left 2 by the way: it brought the last Oct. and Nov. mails. We have not heard anything later by the East. The Mail was accompanied by our friend J. L. Heywood; they all wintered about Devils gate with about 20 of the brethren. They suffered much: subsisting for one month on poor beef, and the next month on Hides. Brother Hey-wood considers he has gained quite an experience in cooking raw hides: they boiled, roasted, stewed and fried all ways; they all lived through it; and left as soon as they could get through for snow, and came near leaving the Mail at last. Many had much anxiety about brother Heywood, and all were glad to see him come home: he looks well, with his long sandy beard. The Mail brought me 6 letters from you, including the one sent by A. W. Babbitt, who as you know was killed by the way. I was truly glad to hear from you and that you was preserved in the railroad smash up.I was glad to hear that you had got along so well with bro. Taylor, in getting us out so good a history of the death of Joseph. I have not yet seen it. I have not heard how it was sent, if by mail I expect it will turn up by and bye when the Winter mails arrive. I called on Bathsheba and read all my letters to her:she had received letters from you too. I was pleased with your dream, and I believe that you will be enabled to start the cars, engine or no engine that is visible, it will be right anyway. We will file it in the office.We have had a hard winter in Utah, if 8 feet of snow in the^[sideways text]Rec[eive]d Sept. 31857at Salt LakeApril 1st, 1857Historian's OfficeGeo. A.

I hope it will continue. the powerof God has been with in preaching and teaching in all the Quorumsand Ward meetings. I commenced with J. M. Grant before he died,and after his death the burthen [burden] of the care of the Missionariesrested upon me and bro. F. D. Richards: who was unwell consid-erable but attended most of the time. L. Snow and O. Hydehave been with me a part of the time. The Presidency and Twelve(except my self) and about 100 others are expecting to go on a summerTrip North to Salmon river.This Spring A. Lyman & C. C.  Rich will be with us aboutthe first of May. I expect they will take a European mission, somemissionaries will be called to Europe, and to the islands. PresidentYoung would like to send a mission to Siberia and the Japan-ese islands. The Lamanites are doing well, Arrowpeene andKanosh with other chiefs are making great improvement. Arrow-peene preached a short discourse in the Tabernacle lately, itwas good.We have given up the Lead mines after making about 10 or12.00 lbs. it is quite expensive and does not work as well as expected.a cotton company are called to go to the Rio Virgin. We are going totry the chinese Sugar cane this summer as far as we can get seed.All is peace and prosperity with us throughout this Territory.some are going to California this Spring, several in the Southernsettlements have started on the short roads, [or] cut off to go there,and no doubt some others will follow them soon.  Your familyare all well, you and the brethren associated with you are 
 earnestly remembered in our prayers.As far as the History is concerned, we finished matters up tothe death of Joseph as far as we could; then brought up the othermatters including the history of the Twelve up to the organizationof the church Augt. 8. I then have taken up the history of Brigham Young and his fathers family briefly, and now am at work on thehistory of the Twelve, from their first organization in a brief form,taking all that belonged to it, up to the 8 August 1844. We haveno trouble now with the Gentiles here in court or anywhere else. Itwould amuse you to read one of the late scenes while in court filedin our office—too lengthy to insert—with Dr. Hurt, Gen. Burr andsome smaller fry, to bullyrag all our laws and their defenders, a part of them came armed with colts, revolvers, it ended in T. S. Williams resignation and Gen. Burr's dismissal from the Bar; andsome others who intended to use the pistols went out of the housein the form of a sled using the seat of their honor for run-ners, dropping their loaded weapons while going out, which theynever afterwards found. all has been quiet since, having but littlelawing on hand.Please not expose my succatash letter to the press, forI write for your own benefit and amusement, not guarded as I wouldwhile writing to men who publish papers.Gen. Burr has written to the department as we areinformed, accusing us of cutting off and wasting the government timberin the Kanyons. I expect he will have an invitation this Spring of going to the upper mill in big cottonwood kanyon, and takinga ride down to Jordan on the top of a big pine log, (if he can stay on thetop of it) and when he has finished his trip, if he thinks it will not costall it is worth to get it, we will pay to Government all that is over, leavinghim to be the judge.Yours trulyW.

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day SaintsP. O. Box, B.Salt Lake City, Utah. May 22, 1893.TO THE PRESIDENTS OF STAKES THROUGHOUT ZION,Dear Brethren:We deem it desirable and also consistent with the promises madeto the Saints that a record be opened in which will be written the namesof all who have contributed by way of donations towards the erection ofthe Salt Lake Temple, with the amount that each one has given. The nameof no person, no matter how young, nor how small the amount subscribed,should be omitted. We shall be pleased to have you forward to this officea list of donors belonging to your Stake at as early a date as practicablegiving the full name and address of every giver, with the correct amountplaced opposite each name.We are particularly desirous of obtaining particulars ofthose who have donated for this purpose since the laying of the cap-stone(6th April, 1892), but would also like your report to go back as far aspossible and contain all amounts paid, including the fifty cent monthlydonations, no matter how long ago they were received. We prefer that thenames in these lists should be arranged alphabetically, but if this isinconvenient, the report can be made out by wards, with the names in eachward placed in alphabetical order.With kindest regards, we remain, Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F. Smith 
 President Woodruff - Then addressed thecongregation.  Said he felt thankful tohis Heavenly Father that he had livedlong enough to speake to so manypeople in Provo.  The Saints must notexpect too much of an old man, ashe with all the Servants of God, wasdependent upon Him for all he done.He had lived in the history of thisChurch some fifty six years, and itwas a marvel to him that he stilllived considering all that the Churchhad passed through, but this is Godswork, and He will uphold it, andHis servants who will obey Him.Bore his testimony that God hadrestored the Holy Priesthood in this dis-pensation, and that He will accom-plish His work according to thewords of His inspired servants.Showed that the work and people ofGod had always been opposed by theinhabitants of the earth: showing alsothe awful consequences upon the nationswho have, and who will shed the bloodof the Lords anointed. He desired the 
 1889March 4ththe year 1888, was read.President Wilford Woodruff Addressedthe Conference.Said we heard this morningfrom Brother Cannon some things whichare of great importance and comfort tothe Latter-day Saints, and we shouldtreasure them up. Spoke of the mannerthe Gospel was restored to the earth inthis dispensation, through the youthfulProphet Joseph Smith, showing that hisname was had for evil among the nationsof the earth the same as that of the Saviorwas in His time. Showed the great workthat God had accomplished through theinstrumentality of the great Latter-dayProphet and his associates.The speaker then read Section 121 of theDoctrine and Covenants and desiredit impressed upon the minds of the Lat-ter-day Saints. He then showed how thejudgements of the Lord had been dealtout to those that had afflicted His Saintsnevertheless the Lord will chasten Hischildren from time to time, untilthey serve Him acceptably.He called upon all the Saints to gobefore the Lord, in humility, and prayfor those things which they need and whichZion needs: for we will have manysevere trials to pass through, and allwill need strength from the Lord.He exhorted the Saints to receive andcarry out in their lives, the counselsgiven them in this Conference and beearnest and sincere in keeping the com-mandments of God; and prayed forthe blessings of God to rest upon the con-gregations of the Saints. 
 Saints to understand that we are passingthrough an experiences all of which is infullfillment of Gods purposes, and warnedthe people not to follow after the things ofthis world, for they will fail them; butit will pay them to be united, and striveto keep the commandments of God, up-holding and sustaining His work.He especially exhorted the Saints in UtahStake to be united, as he felt they neededthis exhortation. 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff—Refered to the revelationsgiven to St John, as giving the history of the worldfrom his time down to the end of the world, makingmanifest the judgements of God which will bepoured out upon the wicked, also showing thatthe Gospel of Christ would be restored through themanifestations of angels.  Bore his testimonythat the Gospel has been restored, to the LatterDay Saints as was portrayed and they occupya much different position in the world from therest of man kind and therefore they shouldwalk uprightly before the Lord and keep allHis commandments that our fellow men seeingour good works will glorify our Father in Heaven 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff—Expressedhis astonishment at the small assemblyof the Saints which had coneved thismorning especially when Provo alonecould fill the Buiding to overflowing ifthey people would turn out. Said hewalked 30 miles in winter time to attendmeeting where he could meet the Eldersof the church and thought if these Saintscould only realize what was before themand the importance of the work theywould have been out to hear the Brethrenof the Priesthood. 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff,—Said BrotherJoseph F Smith had given the correctpattern in which the affairs of the Priet-hood are [chosen],  the one ordained  andappointed of God, and before theconference closes the Saints will haveKnow who the Lords wants to fillthe Presidency of this Stake.He desired to speak uponprinciples connected with this workwe do not understand our true relat-ionship to God, and to each other,spoke of his-feelings and prayersregarding the work of God, in his youthfor he was convinced the the minsters ofthe time were unauthorized to admin-ster the ordinances of the Gospel ofChrist.  Refered to his early exper-ences.

 Apostle Wilford Woodruff was pleased to meetwith the Saints on this Conference. Felt likesaying what the Lord whgave him whetherit be much or little. He felt that the Gospelis as good to day as when first revealed to theProphet Joseph Smith. I some times thinksaid that speaker, "that the Elders in Israelforget who they are and what their destinies ^are^.God us to bear off this work in triumph.He said we have no time to sell or drink liquorand the time will come when a man willnot be allowed to admister the sacrament or enter into the temple, who uses either oneor the other. There is no time to be lost thisgospel must be preached to every nation,kindred, tongue and people befor Jesuscomes in His glory. 
 Apostle Woodruff.  It has been asked some-times, when a person has been called ona mission What has he done? now wewant it understood that the doctrine ofChurch is not to send men on missionswho have committed sins, but thosethat have lead pure lives.Spoke of the Elders in performing missionsin the early rise of this Church; they hadit to do or come under comdemnation.The speaker gave much valuable instruct-ion which was listened to with deepinterest by the many people that were pres-ent. 
 The speaker asked, Has God ^gone^ a journey? "Haveall those revealations been fulfilled?" What are thepeople aposiatizing for? "No man with the Spiritof God will turn from the truth."The speaker earnestly exhorted the Saints toawake from their slumbers and put on thebeautiful garment, to keep the Word ofWisdom, to keep the commandments ofGod, and repent of their sins. He dealt withpleasure upon the working of the UnitedOrder in Arizona, where he had spent histime for something more than a year.The speaker stated that he visited many ofthe Lamanites in Arizona and conversed withtheir chief, and leading men. Found themanxious to hear the Word of the Lord andto learn something of their forefathers. Theyare industrious, ecanomical, and clean. 
 Aleppo, Turkey Feb 21st 1894Prest. Wilford Woodruff.Dear BrotherI write you in relation to a matter thatis the cause of much trouble to us here in this branchof the church. Dispensing with preliminaries and to bebrief I will say that we have an Elder here by thename of Geo. A. Vizerian who is giving us much troubleas follows—In the latter part of Dec. last,while residing at Aintab in the performance of my mis-sionary labors I recieved a letter signed by all of theSaints except about three, asking me to come here (Aleppo)immediately as there was trouble existing in the church.On my arrival here I found them to be in a sadcondition. There was considerable enmity between ElderVizerian on the one hand and the two Priests and the Saintson the other. Things had been going from bad to worseuntil a short time previous to my coming, when the Elder,(Vizerian would come to meeting on Sunday, administerthe Sacrament and the Saints refusing to partake of it,he would say they were all damned and call them ap-ostates etc. and dismiss the services and go away.I did not think it wisdom to enter into a judicialinvestigation of the matters for fear of iritating or wideningthe gap between them, so I appointed a meeting andafter reminding them that we all had our faults andimperfections succeeded in having them all ask 
 forgiveness of each ^other^ promising to forget the past and livebetter in the future. I thought we had made a perma-ment reconciliation but it has proven not to be so.As I have now learned the facts I find the trouble cameabout in this way.About two years or more ago, Elder Vizerian, the two Priests,and some of the Saints now here were living in Aintab.An elder by name of Garoutch was presiding over them.Elders Garoutch and Vizerian told the Saints that they wereprophets, and Garoutch had a revelation, or revelationsfor their guidance; and he did many things that did notreflect any credit on the Latter Day Saints. Some monthsafterwards he (G) became insane, and some months laterdied a violent death. The American physicians afterexamination, by his convulsions etc. pronounced hisdeath to be by poison. There seems to be some mysteryconcerning his death, of which Elder Vizerian knows butrefuses to divulge.The Priests and some of the Saints did not believe in therevelations of Garoutch whereupon he denounced themas apostates etc. Since Garoutchs' death Elder Vizeriandenounces all who speak against him (G) and his revel-ations, especially one of the priests whom he calls aJudas, and they remained away from church.Now that they have removed here, the troubles ar[e] renew-ed here of course. Elder Vizerian has been presidinghere with the results as above stated, until my arrival. 
 He has been keeping the books, tithing etc.After our reconciliation as stated above, the saints desiredand elected or sustained unanimously a brotherHagopian as clerk to keep the tithing accts etc.When Elder Vizerian came to turn over the books andfunds on hand he took his tithing and donations forseveral years past out of the fund and refused to turnit over. For the only man here holding the higherPriesthood to act in such a manner hurt the saints verymuch. To my questions as to why he did so he wouldonly answer that he acted according to the dictates of theSpirit. I could only with much difficulty apease theindignation of the saints and I felt it my duty to say thata non-tithing payer was not in good standing or fellowshipand according to Church order should not be allowed to ad-minister in any of the ordinances of the Gospel, which Ihave carried into effect, knowing that the saints would notrecieve administrations at his hands.For two months past we have been holding meeting threeor four times a week having a little peace then turmoilalternately, caused by this elders' actions and sayings.He comes to the meetings and sits quietly, but every opportu-nity he has he condemns the saints and prophesies thattrouble will come upon them (not saying what the troublewill be) and thus keeps up an agitation that will giveus no rest. Two nights ago at 12 oclock midnighthe baptised two young men and administered Sacrament 
 to them etc. without my knowledge or that of the saints.When I learned of this I told him that under existing circum-stances he should not have done so, that the saints here normyself did not approve it, to which he said "I do notcare for you, the church or any man so long as God com-mands it me." When I ask him for evidence that I mayknow that he is commanded to do these things he onlysays "I bear my testimony to you that it is true: if youwish to know more ask God he will tell you."He is an unmarried man and together with a youngman named Geo. live in a house by themselves, wherethey have dreams and visions almost without number.From his mysterious sayings and actings actions Iinfer that he thinks they are those two prophets that are tocome on this continent; in fact I am told that he has saidso. Astounding as this statement may seem I verilybelieve that he considers themselves to be such, and hedoes not hesitate in telling me that all things are madeknown to them.I say nothing against the manifestations of the Spiritfor personal advancement and benifit, on the contraryI advocate it, but I understand from Doc & Cov's thathe only who stands at the head of the church can recieverevelations for the church: else order would be subverted.He told me to day that he was spiritual president of thechurch here, I was but temporal. I was not inclinedto believe, although I heard it said many times, that he 
 thought himself a prophet until I accidentally sawa copy of his letter to you dated about Jan 12 or 13th [18]94in which he speaks of those two prophets.He since told me several times that he expected a letterfrom you, shortly, which would open my eyes to thingsimpossible to believe now and which would accountfor all his peculiar actions. I think you will under-stand his short, mysterious letter better after readingthis. I think his letter was written to you upon thesubject mentioned for your approval and confirmation.I present this case to you because he will not submit itto any lower authority, considering himself above any butyourself and agreeing to abide by your reply to his letter.You will have perhaps have answered his letterbefore this reaches you. If you have understandingit fully, I hope it may settle our affairs here.If you did not understand it fully or have not yet an-swered it, I ask you to do so at your earliest convenienceand let it be direct and emphatic that he may have aplain understanding of the same that we may be en-abled to establish peace and harmony, for a continuanceof affairs as we have had them for the last two monthsor more will soon lead to the utter anihilation of thisbranch of the church. I ask you to answer this com-munication with all the instructions you deem it nec-essary for me to have upon this matter, or any others,also a copy toof your reply to him. 
 I ask these things only if in your best judgement andby the dictation of the Holy Ghost you see fit so to do.I remain your brother inthe Gospel of Jesus ChristF. A. Huish.PS. I think you know this bro. by correspondenceat least.Our church membership might have been doubledbut for him, and some (especially the Priests) areremaining away from our services, and somepostponing baptism because of him.(I understand that it is informal to refer church troublesdirectly to yourself but as I stated he will submit itto no other, not even to the prest. of European missionpromising to govern himself according to your reply)I have stated the root of the troubles only and thereare many branches growing out of it. It is impossi-ble to describe the tumult and contentions we havehad.Trusting you may approve my actions I am,Resp[ec]t[fully],F. A.

I desire from thebottom of my heart to comminucate you my joy in beginningto a new year with the poepleof God. I thank God and knowby the power of his Spirit thatthat Joseph Smith is Prophet,and his revelations are true,as it is written in the book of 
 Doctrines & covenants.The Revelator asks—What is to be understood by thetwo witnesses, in the 11th  chapterof Revelations?Such it was answered—They are two Prophets thatare to be raised up to the Jewishnation in the last days, at the timesof restoration and to prophesy tothe Jews, after they are gathered &build the city of Jerusalim in theland of their fathers.How joyful to have faithto these words of happiness?Another question— 
 What are we to understandby the sounding of the trumpets,mentioned in the 8th chapterof Revelations?The Answer is given as youread Section 77. & 12 Verse.I Raise God with power &spirit he has bestowed upon me,because the spirit knows thesixth Angel, having autherity toordain eldesrs, one for destructionand one for salvation.I ask your prayers for methat I ever remain your brotherin preaching the Gospel of Christ.Kevork.

Notwistanding that the Seas are not calm (safe) in the month of March, I am obliged to go now first to cavoid unneccessary expense and secondly to get away from this cold placeI disire that you would paray to God especially to heal me of my sickness and also that I may arrive home in safety and prosper me in 
 my labors that I may show my gratitude for the great favors the Church has bestowed upon, by doing some little service for my Church and my bretheren.I feel regret that I was not permitted to enter the Templenor to receve a portion of the Priesthood in Zion, so that if I should die I would have been anointed and been in the Temple. It seems that God did not see fit this time; but if I live and God permits me I shall come with my family.Perhaps the Lord did not open the way this time that I might constantly desire to bring my family to ZionI belive that gGod will permit 
 me to see that day. I also disireyou to pray for me that this maybe so.I received your telegram onSunday Mar 10th and today Ireceived the money and I shallget my ticket and leave onthe 330 train this afternoonfor Brooklyn.

 Provo City, June 12  [18]89President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In conformity with Circular No. 4, and given Noticeof the Secretary of the General Board of Education, the threeappointed Examiners met with the Graduates for NormalCertificates, at the B. Y. Academy, Provo, Monday, May 27,at 9 A.M. Sixteen, that is 14 gentlemen, and 2 ladies, reported.There were two more who had previously announced their in-tention to graduate, but one was taken ill, and the other wasprevented from attending by a death in the family. It had beendecided by the Board of Examiners to have the first three daysdevoted to the written examination, and the questions, (copiesof which are herewith enclosed to be placed on file by theSecretary G. B. S.,) which had been previously submitted byeach one of us to the Board of Examiners for approval, wereplaced successively on the Blackboard, and were workedout by the Graduates under my own supervision. Everyanswer received its percentage, the total of the wholeset making the total of efficiency in that respective branchtogether them with the total in the practical and oral examinationin the same study. A Graduate considering himself as 
 by any of the Examiners in any one point, should have theright of asking for an explanation, and if then not satisfied,of an appeal in the case to the Board of Examiners. Severalexplanations have been asked, which, however, proved satis-factory in every instance, and no appeal became necessary.It had been decided that in case of the Percentage in GeneralEfficiency should fall^ing^ below 60, no Certificate should beissued. This occurred only in the case of Michael Barclay, 49%.That man is absolutely unqualified for a teacher; his answersin Grammar, Theory of Teaching, and Geography, seem almostto indicate a partially unsound mind. When he reportedhis intention to me to graduate, I cautioned him privately, buthe is so full of his own conceit that nothing could con-vince him of his incapacity. He only attended the Acade-my one term some years ago, failing them entirely. I havealso notified all Graduates that fell below 75% in anyone branch to pass another examination in that par-ticular branch next ^under one^ year, until they reach an efficiencyof at least 75%. During Thursday and Friday each oneof us three held oral and practical examinationssimultaneously in separate rooms, having a class 
 of schoolchildren (30 in number) divided between us forthat purpose. Saturday morning we spent in consul-tation and arranging the statistics of our Examination.The results of which have been put into the hands of theSecretary in the form of a Schedule. As there may be casespresenting themselves during the summer, or the next school-year, of persons soliciting examination; we have proposed,therefore, that any one of us three, residing or being inthe region of country of said person, might be commissionedby the chairman of Examiners, upon due application havingbeen made in time, to hold that examination, each oneof us furnishing the questions pertaining to this department.If this arrangement should meet your approval, our workmay be facilitated considerably in such cases.As the B. Y. Academy commences Aug. 5, and you havegiven me the privilege to remain with that institutionthe first 10 weeks for the purpose of organizing andstarting the Normal Department in conformity withthe requirement of Circular No. 4, I shall be at libertyto travel wherever you should desire me to go, on orafter October 11 or rather October 4 already, the tenth 
 week being Conference week. I should desire to visit thenorthern Stakes, where churchschools are, during the hotterseason and take the South during the fall and winter,if possible. As President Geo. Q. Cannon has granted methe privilege to have my name retained as Principalof the B. Y. Academy for the next year, I shall draw upthe Circular for that institution, meet with the newlyorganized Stake Board, and make with them such ar-rangements as the interests of the institution maty re-quire during the protracted periods of my absence afterthe first ten weeks. By a private letter from Bro. Benj-Cluff, now at Ann Arbor, I learn, that he is inclinedto come home at once, if his services would be requiredand a suitable salary could be promised him. It doesnot seem wisdom to me to make any more assurancesand promises of definite position or salary before en-tering the churchschool-service, which step should al-ways be taken by the candidate bonafide, nor couldwe venture to place any man into s such a responsibleposition as the Principalship of the B. Y. Academy is,nor in on coming directly from the East, before we have 
 ascertained to what extent his spirit and methods havebeen influenced by his eastern sojourn. I h Thus, I think,Bro. Cluff might work himself into it as my deputyduring my periods of absence, until he can take it all.That was partly the course Bro. Tanner pursued after hisreturn home and before going to Logan. In other respectsBro. Cluff would be preferable for that position to anyoneelse I know of. I also understand that the authoritiesof Bear Lake Stake have made ouvertures to Bro. Cluff;to be the Principal of their Academy. These Bear Lakepeople have done so many queer things educationally and otherwise that I do not wonder at that course so muchat variance with the instructions contained in theCirculars. The next four weeks will have to be spent most-ly at my office in order to have everything arranged in orderby July 15th, when the Records should all be straight, andthe annual Report to the General Board be made.The remaining three weeks, at least a portion of it, I hope to usefor some much needed recuperation in the mountains.With constant prayers for your welfare I remain Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser 
 Provo City, July 17 89President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,The telegram of Bro. Reynolds, concerning those Stakesthat have not yet secured Principals was just received.In answer I report as follows: Bannock  Stake Academyat Rexburg has not reported, but it is presummed that Bro.Spori with his Assistant, Bro. Nielson, will continue, althoughthe former is just now on the Underground in consequence of the unfortunate test oath trouble. To Cassia Stake BoardI have written today in answer to Bro. Thos. E. Harper's letter sent to me by Bro. Reynolds and among other points sugges-ted to them the name of Bro. Geo. Cole, who graduated thisspring before the Board of Examiners and lives in thatStake. Oneida Stake Academy at Franklin has not yet re-ported nor has asked for a successor to Bro. Cornwall,retired on account of ill health. Bear Lake Academyat Paris has not reported. Box Elder Stake Academy hasno Principal and does not know how to pay one as theysay. I have transferred Bro. Jos. J. Anderson from thereto Sevier Stake Academy at Richfield, and Bro. Hayes,resigned on account of taking a course in the Sciences. 
 Office General Board of Education. April 4, 1889.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In compliance with your letter of March 2nd, instruc-ting me to visit the Stake Academies at Salt Lake,Logan, Brigham, and Ogden, I started on the thusappointed circuitvisit Thursday, March 21, andhave the honor to submit herewith and subjoined re-port of the work assigned me.All necessary appointments in regard to my in-tended visit having been made with the respectiveStake Boards and Faculties, and having placed my-self at their disposal for any good they might thinkI could do while with them, for the cause of true edu-cation, I met with the Salt Lake Stake Board ofEducation, Thursday, March 21, at 8 P.M. PresidentAngus M. Cannon presiding, all members of theBoard, and the Principal, Prof. Talmage, present.During the progress of the meeting, a petition of thisStake Board to the General Board was called upagain and read. The Secretary stating that it ^had^ had beenduly forwarded a long time ago but no answer hadbeen returned. The purport of the petition was thesuggestion, upon the advice of the church-attorneys,that the General Board should take at once propersteps to in corporate the Stake Board of Education,as many very important property questions wereinvolved. It was also stated that difficulties hadarisen in regard to the name of their Academy,and a majority of the members seemed to favorthe name of Brigham Young Academy, to assure 
 continued.Bro. Barnes, Chairman of the Kaysville Local Boardof Education, wrote to me applying for a Principalfor their "Academy". I have answered him, thatI supposed the Board of Education for Davis Stake had fully approved of their organization this being the case,the name of Bro. Allison, their heretofore district schoolteacher, so he is an entire stranger to me, and whom theydesired for their Principal, should be presented to theStake Board also for approval. If on their requested,that Bor. Allison should write a letter of applicationto me signifying his intention to enter the Churchschool-Service, which letter should be accompanied by aBishop's Certificate of his standing in the Church, aCertificate of Efficiency of his Normal training fromwherever he had graduated, and any testimonials forhis practiced labor as a teacher which he may have.Then I should notify him when and where to reportfor his examination by a Representative of the Boardof Examiners, in order to obtain a Certificate withoutwhich he could not assume the duties of that office.Davis Stake Academy in Farmington has correspon- 
 the benefits of certain bequests. The members ex-pressed themselves much satisfied with the labors of thePrincipal of the Academy and of his Associates.Friday, March 22nd. I attended the classexercises of the Salt Lake Stake Academy, in Theology, Grammar,Arithmetic, Physics, and a General Theological Classin the afternoon. If the unappropriateness of the premisesof this institution for educational purposes, par-tially over some by many clever makeshiftarrange-ments, would only be the cause of some inconve-nience for teachers and students, this circumstancewould be entitled to but a passing remark in mypresent report, but ventilation as well as light are sodefective that the health of the students, in spite of the great caution and vigilance of the Principal,is continually endangered. Although the exceeding-ly narrow stairs caused some crowding of studentsduring changes of classes, the discipline and order-in the general management of the exercises deserveshonorable mention. The students seem interested intheir studies, their answers were bright and readilygiven, and their written work very commendable.I found the Daily Programme judiciously arran-ged, and the Plan of Studies carefully followedby the teachers. In the Faculty meeting at the closeof the school in the afternoon, the reports of thePrincipal and teachers showed to me a united fandharmonious feeling in spirit and method ofteaching. The general prospects of this Academy,intellectually and spiritually are exceedingly en-couraging. Although the singing of the Academy 
 continuedded with me about a Principal. I proposed to themthe name of Bro. Joshua Greenwood as Principal, whohas since then visited there and the preliminaries forhis engagement has already been made, pending thefixing of his salary, he demanding $800. I do not thinkthis organization of a seperate "Academy" at Kaysvillein so small a Stake a wise move. A secondary schoolas a feeder for their Stake Academy, should have beena better plan. I am afraid there is local jealousy atthe bottom of it, and it forebodes no good for theeducational interests of that Stake. The 18th WardL. D. S. School has proposed Bro. David R. Allen asPrincipal, and Miss Mattie Snow as Lady Teacher.I have submitted that case to the S. L. S. Boardand they write that they had no objection to Bro.Allen, provided he complies with the regulationsfor churchschool-teachers, set forth in Gen. Circ: No. 4.I have written Bro. Allen in the same manner, as Irequired Bro. Allison at Kaysville to do. WithRandolph, Morgan, and Coalville arrangementsfor the continuance of their former Principals have 
 Choir was creditable, the vocal art of Singing has notyet recieved that attentionin this institution which itsimportance demands, and the engagement of aSinging teacher for next schoolyear should forma point of earnest consideration for the S. L.S. Board. I regret that I had no opportunity to makethe aquaintence of this lady teacher, Ms. Mattie Hughes,and ^therefore could not^ confer with her concerning her labors amongthe female students.  The S. L. Stake Board havemade great efforts in preserving scientific apparatus andmany valuable recommendations for the benefit ofthe Academy. By special request I delivered a lecturebefore the Students' Society that Friday evening,which was well attended.Saturday, March 23rd I arrived in Logan atnoon, and was informed at my arrival that I wasexpected to lecture that evening before the Polysophi-cal Society of the B. Y. College. The subject havingbeen previously agreed upon. Although scarcelyrecovered ffrom a severe spell of sickness, andsuffering under the affects of a cold I endeavered toperform that duty to the best of my ability, andwas rewarded with a very appreciative audience.Sunday, March 24, I attended the Missionarymee-ting of the Collegestudents in the forenoon, andcannot express myself warmly enough in com-menting upon the Spirit pervailing in thatmeeting, manisfesting itself in the singing,prayers, and testimonies of the young people.After attending divine service in the afternoonI spent the remainder of the day in conversing 
 continuedbeen made. I understand that Tooele Stake has erected a fine Academy building at Grantsville,and that they desire Bishop Wm. Collett one of mydear old Graduates, to be the Principal. But neitherthey nor he have mentioned anything to me aboutit. Bro. Wootton, Chairman of the Wasatch Stake Boardhas conferred with me in person and in writing, sta-ting that they are vigorously striving to have everythingready by October 2 for opening. We promised to meetagain and I am waiting for his communicationin order to make a suitable selection for a Principal,as for various reasons a very careful choice for thatStake has to be made. Springville L. D. S. High Schoolis without a Principal; Bro. Simon Eggertson the for-mer occupant of that position, having been calledto the position of Bishop's Counsellor in the II Ward,Provo, will goin teach the District school in that Wardby general request. The Local Board have not yet ap-plied for a successor hoping to persuade Bro.Eggertson to remain with them. Ephraim andFilmore Academies retain their Principals like 
 with the Principal and some teachers of theCollege about the affairs of their institution in orderto obtain as thorough an information in regardto their station as words could convey. Monday,March 25, was devoted entirely to witnessing the class-exercises, in Theology, Rhetoric, Grammar, Mathe-matics, Geography, Reading, Theory of Teaching,General History, and Penmanship. Although onlythe Principal, Prof. Tanner, and one of his teachers, Bro.Todd, are Graduates of our [Normal] Academy, and,therefore, thoroughly posted in regard to our methodand system of teaching, it was very gratifying to ob-serve the readiness with which especially, their the teachers of Mathematics, Bro. Kerr, has identifiedwith himself with the new plan of teaching.The premises and accomodations of the Collegeare excellent both in regard to senitary as wellas disciplinary arrangement. The Ladies' Depart-ment, comprising ^also^ a Library and Readingroom,in charge of Mrs. Jennie Tanner, constitute a promi-nent feature in this institution. In Music, bothinstrumental and vocal, the B. Y. College standsahead of any of the institutions in our Church-schoolorganization, and I commend Bro. H. Wahl-strom as a Music teacher of highmerits. The VocalArt should raise great attention throughout ourChurchschoolorganization, and I should suggest tothe General Board to make this branch of studyan object of special recommendation in thenext Circular. Since the appointment ofProf. Tanner as Principal, the B. Y. College has 
 continuedLogan, Salt Lake, and Provo. There is, however, acircumstance arising in Mt. Pleasant, which I haveto report to you. Some time ago, Bro. C. N. Lund, of thatplace, wrote to me for instructions in regard to the estab-lishment of a L. D. S. school in that there as an offsetto the sectarian schools which they are ifflicted with.I told him to apply to their Stake Board for permissionto organize and then I should take pleasure in assistingthem to the best of my ability. It appears, however, thatPresident Peterson is afraid that a local institutionat Mt. Pleasant will interfere with the developmentof their Stake Academy at Ephraim, and refuses hisconsent. There is now ^[being]^ at Mt. Pleasant, Bro. Geo. Chris-tensen, who graduated with the highest honor this springbefore the Church Board of Examiners. He taughtformerly a Grammar School at Mt. Pleasant, isa favorite with the people, and carries an enormousinfluence with the young people. They are nowafraid that I will call that young man awayand give him a prominent position in one of our Academies, and implore me not to make 
 undergone a very thorough reorganization in orderto bring it more into line with our another church-schools, a change, which naturally should suggesta corresponding retardation in the regular andaccustomed advancement of the students. It givesme great pleasure, however, to state, that the general-ity of the students not only seem to be reconciledto the new regime, but appear to have enteredinto the spirit of it with vim and delight.By mangement, Bro. Samuel Cornnell, Princi-pal of Oneida Stake Academy, at Franklin,Idaho met me at Logan, and I learned fromhim following points of interest concerning hisAcademy: His health has been greatly im-paired by overtaxing himself. He had only alady teacher to assist him, who was not acquain-ted at all with any systematic way of teaching.He had no maps, charts, or any utensils of con-sequence to assist him in his labors, and noapparatus of any kind. Over 100 studentsin atendance.  He gave a public examinationwhich was highly commended upon. Thepeculiar situation of the Saints in his neighbor-hood has had a depressing effect uponthis new educational enterprise at present.He is worn out, intends resigning at theend of the present term, and take anotheryears's Normal Course as a Postgraduate. 
 continuedany appointment for him, until they would writeagain, trying in the meantime to get Pres. Peterson's con-sent. I should plead this cause before you, that youmight assist them by your counsel. Bro: AllenR. Cutler, Principal of Panguitch Stake Academywrites, that the Stake Board there has concluded tokeep their Academy only 30 weeks per year, and thatthey would pay him monthly at $7500. Bro. Cutleris not willing to continue under such conditions ashe wants to be employed for the whole year, herather will go to the Academy at Provo and studythe higher courses I wrote Bro. Allen with the requestto submit my letter to that Stake Board also, statingthat Pres. Woodruff did not approve of limitingthe school year to such an extent, and that I hadno Principal that would be willing to acceptposition under such a condition. We expected ourteachers to be employed all the year round, willnot to be compelled to travel around the countryas bookagents, serving [machine agents etc.] a [portion]of the year to make a living, or keeping strolling 
 In meeting with the Faculty of the B. Y. College, on Mon-day afternoon, I found the Daily Programme ju-diciously arranged, the progress in the exercises re-gistered weekly, and the plans and instructionsof the Principal conscientiously observed. A con-traction in the number of instructors for nextschoolyear seems to be desired, and Bro. Apperly,who is also County Superintendent of Distr. Schools,intends to retire from the College. On accountof the absence of most of the members, a meetingof the Stake Board of Education could not beheld, but it was suggested by Bro. Geo. W. Thatcher,that the members of that Board could meet at SaltLake during Conference. The title of College forthis institution is at yet somewhat inappropriate,but the facilities of the school are so excellent,that by judicious management the Collegestatusmay be obtained within a comparatively shorttime. I arrived at Brigham City, Tuesday, March26 at 2 P.M. and was hospitably recieved andentertained by Apostle Lorenzo Snow. A meeting hadbeen appointed in the Tabernacle in the evening, inwhich by request I addressed the congregation onthe objects of our churchschoolorganization in gener-al and ^of^ the Box Elder Stake Academy in particular.The fornoon of the following day was devotedto attending the class exercises at the Academy usedto meeting with the Faculty at the consultation.The Faculty had consisted of the Principal, Bro.Jos. J. Anderson and three Assistants, of whom twohowever, have retired on account of the contraction 
 from place to place, term after term, or year afteryear, teaching after a fashion, taking root no where,benefitting nobody, and accomplishing nothing.last week until last Monday I was in Beaver for a"rest". My son Reinhard has concluded to remainanother year as Principal. I met twice with the StakeBoard, and procured them an Assistant Teacher inthe person of Bro. Daniel Beck, and of our last Spring'sGraduates. The Academy will occupy the so called IIWard Meeting house until after the end of the Septemberterm of the District Court by Nov. 1 when the new Courthouse is to be occufined and the old promisses of theAcademy will be vacated. Kanab Stake Board willbe ready by October and will write again for aPrincipal, when all arrangements have been per-fected. I ahve been compelled to recall Bro. Oscar Vance from the District school at Parowan, and tosend him to Ogden at Assistant to Bro. Moench. Bro.Vance being one of our most intelligent church schoolteachers will be an indispousable acquistitive to theWeber Stake Academy at Ogden. This move being 
 of the Programme to suit the reduced number ofattendance. The Principal as well as his Assistent,Ms Sadie Tanner, are working by a carefully de-vised Daily Programme, are following closelytheir laid out Plan, and register their weeklylabors acording to instructions. Several classeshad to be reconstructed at the beginning of thepresent term on account of the change of teachers,but it was gratifying to note the readiness withwhich the students had accommodated them-selves to the new classification. This is the first, orexperimental year of this Academy and, likeall new enterprises, has to establish its reputationmore corresponding influence. The good begin-ning made will furnish the institution afair starting for the next academic year. Bro.Anderson, being a young man, has needed sev-eral times kind words of encouragement to arousehim from a growing despondency in regard tothe work assigned him. A very interesting Board- meeting was held the previous afternoon, whichwas attended by Pres. Lorenzo Snow, the Principal,all the members of the Board but one, and bymyself. The Principal complained of lack of ap-paruyus, maps, and books, of sufficient prepar-ation of students on entering the Academy, andthe frequent changes of the teachers. The members ofthe Board expressed sucessively their satisfac-tion with the teachers and their determinationto advance the interests of the Academy. TheBoard intends to enlarge the premises and the [illegible] 
 vigorously but mainly protested against by the school-authorities at Parawan, I suggested to them the advise-bility of organizing a Stake Board and get a Church-school, where it should give me great pleasure to sendthem as good a Principal for their Academy, as I for-merly had done for their district school. I was toldin Beaver, they are organizing.  St. George Academycontinues under the same Principalship and Faculty.Snowflake Academy, Arizona, writes under June 26, forPresident Jesse M. Smith, that their Academy buildingis now in good condition, having comfortable ac-comendations for 50 scholars. But they are in a quarndary for a Principal, as Bro. Webb, theirPrincipal heretofor, has a large family andcannot afford to labor any longer for such asmall salary. They would like to have Bro.Dennis Harris, now in the Southern Mission, butthink the same difficulty will be incountered in his case, although it might be more advan-tageous for him to be with them in Arizonathan to be exposed to [perciovation] in Utah.

Wednesday,March 27, I started in arrived with the afternoontrain at Ogden, where I was cordially receivedby President Shurtliff, and conveyed to his house;to recuperate before the meeting of the StakeBoard in the evening. My health being some-what impaired. The meeting of the Stake Boardof Education, President Shurtliff presiding, washeld in the Courthouse and was attended by all themembers. The amount of tuition formed a greatpart of the discussion,  as it had to be fixed very low in consideration of the peculiar sitution ofeducational affairs in Ogden. They have accom-modation just now for about 1575 students,and have three rooms at their disposal. Thenecessity of a schoolbuilding of their ownwas declared to be very urgent, and Pres. Shurt-liff intimited that he had a scheme, althoughnot yet fully matured, to obtain one. The em-ployment of a Ladyteacher, and of a teacherof Music was recognized as a matter ofgreat importance. The entire schooltime onthe following day from 8 A.M. until 4 P.M.was spent in witnessing the classexercises ofthe Academy. There was only the Principaland his first Assistant, Bro. Waldram, in attendance; his second Assistant, Bro. E. Cutler,one of the Normal students of the B. Y. Academy

Moench has been out of practice fora number of years, his classwork, consistingthus for mostly of the intermediate grade,is very satisfactory, and some points which Icalled his attention to will by strict observance,facilitate his labors greatly in future. Bro.Waldram is what may be called a teacher ofthe old school, whose methods of teaching willscarcely harmonize for a great length of timewith the rest of the Faculty of this Academy. ThePrimary Grade was conducted by one of Bro.Moench's Normals in a mattnner highly credi-table for this young beginner, especially as heconducts his classes only temperarily during theabsence of Bro. Cutler, who has since returnedto Ogden. I addressed in the evening a largeaudience under the auspices of the PolysophicalSociety of the Weber Stake Academy, and startedFriday, March 29, in the morning with thetrain for Farmington, where I had been re-quested to attend the monthly Priesthoodmee-ting of that Stake on the establishment of aStake Academy. President Smith presiding.By request I laid the aims and workings of ourChurchschoolorganizative before the bretheren.The importance of ladyteachers, and the cultiva-tion of Singing was [duelled] upon also at somelength.

I calledthe attention of these bretheren to the very elaborateoutside of the building; the great cost of whichcould only be met with under our present circumstances at the expense and to the lossof far more important and useful items inside,as for instance apparatus, library, utensils,cabinets, and laberatories [etc.] After the Priesthoodmeeting, the Stake Board of Education met,and we discussed and rectified a planfor the Stake Academy. That same morningreturned to Salt Lake City, and thus closethis circuitvisitThere are several pionts of a general nature thathave been brought out during this circuitvisitin my conversations with members of Stake boardsand Faculties.1. That only teachers be employed by StakeBoards that hold a Certificate in this for a Pri-mary, Intermediate, or Academic Teacher, issuedby the General Examining Board.2. The difference in the grades of a among ourChurch Academies is so wide, that ^a^ well definedgrade should be established for each, until changedby order of the General Board.3.

 Provo, November 24. [18]88.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Since my last letter of the 3rd inst. to you the work in our church-school-organization has been going on at an increasing ratio, andconsider it my duty to make a short summary report to you asfar as I have been able to obtain information. As until the timesof the issuing of Circular No. 2, my intercourse with the variousAcademies was confined to [illegible] occasions when I was either instruc-ted by you to write to certain parties, or my assistance was so-licited by Stake Authorities or Teachers themselves, a systemat-ic operation of all our existing schools, tending to a harmo-nious blending of all our labors to a common end, couldnot very well be attempted, without the appearance of of-ficiousness on my part, which very suspicion would domore harm than any possible good could have beengained by premature overanxiety. But your Circular,putting affairs at once into proper shape, enjoins simplyupon me the duty to inform myself to some extent inregard to the spirit, condition, and results of every church-school, and to labor with the end in view, that every schoolof our organization feels itself as a constituent part of a 
 Provo City, June 29, 89President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Referring to a passage in my letter of the 24th inst. to theSecretary Bro. Geo. Reynolds in regard to Bro. Joshua Green-wood whom I had suggested as Principal of the Box ElderStake Academy, versa Bro. J. J. Anderson resigned, I beg leaveto make following additional reports: Bro. Greenwood,being a man with a family, and naturally anxious aboutany disposition to be made of him in the church school ser-vice, wrote to me about some decision. I did quiet himuntil I should receive an ^answer^ from President Clawson ofBrigham City to my letter of inquiry. Thatis answer ar-rived this morning but leaves me in the dark as muchas ever, at least as far this Academy is concerned.  Bro. R. Clawson states in the first place, that they shouldlike to know to what extent the General Board will assistthem, and then, what amount Bro. Greenwood desires assalary. In the second place he says, if the General Boardwould pay the Principal's salary, the Stake Board couldmeet the other obligations such as providing for assis-tant teachers, running expenses viz. viz.; otherwise they

I submit, herewith a few points, intended to becommunicated to the various Principals for report, so thatI can make a summary report to you previous to nextApril Conference.Suggestive Points to the Academy Principals.1. Give full name, Priesthood, Graduating, and Curriculum,Age, and Salary of every teacher, whether regular or Specialist.2. When was your Academy organized?3. Give names of successive Principals, and ^names of^ teachers undereach.4. Which department does your Academy consist of?5. Make a general report about the condition of yourpromises, furniture, and utensils.6. What is the condition or prospect of your Laberatory,Cabinet, Library, and Scientific apparatus?7. Do you hold regular faculty meetings withMinutes on record? 
 2. continuedcould not see their way through. Thirdly, that theyhad paid Bro. Anderson $60000; 1/2 Cash; 1/4 Mdse; 1/4 Tithingwhich arrangement had been of considerable benefit tothe Academy. As points 2 and 3 hinge on the outcome ofpoint 1, no definite idea presents itself to my mind uponwhich I could formulate a proposition to Bro. Green-wood, who wants to make his arrangements before the opening of the school year.There is a great deal of crowding upon me justnow going on by many of the teachers that have not yet been disposed of, "to know what their dispositionis to be, as the district schools are after them withenticing propositions. I wish these Stake Boardswould hurry up their reports, in regard to their wantsof Principals and Teachers, that I could dispose of them.I am afraid, that when all available teachers havesecured positions for themselves, we in the church-school-service have to take what is left, instead ofhaving the first choice.With constant prayers for your welfare I remainYour brother in the Gospel.

What dates are your Public Examinations?Please to instruct me in regard to these or other pointsof a similar nature you should desire to have attendedto.As the B.Y. Academy has now reached the number of326 registered students and still more coming, and inaddition to this, Bro. N. L. Nelsen, one of my principalteachers has been prevented from being at his post on ac-count of dyphtheria in his family with no prospect ofspeedy recovery, my labors have multiplied greatly uponme, and prevent me, therefore, from visiting occasional-ly one or the other of those Academies just now, al-though quite a number of them are constantly askingme to come.Bro.

 Provo City, August 7th 89President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,The Brigham Young Academy commenced its fourteenth academic year last Monday morning with over 100 students, which number is still increasing, and by the indications we expect one of the largest atten-dances this Academy has ever seen. There are now al-ready 45 Normals enrolled, of whom 10 come under the Church appropriation thus far. The names of those selected on the strength of promises given dur-ing last academic year, are as follows:Charles Dorius, of Ephraim; Wm. Winters of ;John Johnson, of  ;  Geo. Shelley of Lehi; Alex-ander Nielson, of Provo; John H. Wootton, of American Fork; Alice Findley, of Panacca, Nev.; Mary L. Hansen, of Parowan; Amelia Fillerup, of Lake Shore; Annie E. Carlsen, of   . There have been, however,so many Normals last year, who have paid their tuition all along in the hope to come under the appropriation, that I am in great embarrassment in regard to some of them.

But a few remain concerning whom I do not know what to do. I have either to send them home again, or pay their tuition myself. They are deserving, and have had partly a promise to the effect, if there should be a chance; their names are: Alice Reynolds, of Salt Lake City; Annie Brown, of Pleasant Grove; Wallace Billings, of Manti; and George Middleton, of Ashley's Fork; and Jos. Dunyon, of Draper. I lay the case of these five last named students before you in the hope of getting some instructions in regard to the course, I shall take concerning them. The last two ^but one^ have been practical teachers already. Our Normal Department once enjoyed an additional appro-priation for ten students from the Utah County Court, which for fear of "Liberal" opposition had to be withdrawn, and we have kept up

Crosbyhas written to you also about the difficulty, enclosing myletter to the P. S. Board per A. N. Cutler. I see no other way be-sides finishing the controversy.  Permit me to call yourattention to the passage in my summary report to you,of July 17, where on page 6, I refer to the Panguitch StakeAcademy.  As my letter concerning the matter has beenforwarded to you by Bro. Crosby, a comparison bet-ween my report to you and that letter will show thecorrectness of my statement.  My enclosed letter toBro. Crosby of today, will furnish the last argumentin the case, and I shall abide by your decision.If you shall direct not otherwise, please let Bro.Geo. Reynolds send my letter to Bro. Crosby.With kind regardsYour brother in the GospelKarl G. MaeserPlease return Bro. Crosby'sletter to him.

The reorganization of the de-partment also now, in order to meet the require-ments of our advanced grade in the Churchschool-service; and the special course for lady teachers,all of which arrangements the Junior Normalsclasses in the other Academies are not yet prepared to comply with, necessitate extra pecuniary efforts, that it will be impossible for this Academy alone to make! I once before proposed to the General Board the establishment of a Primary Drill Department for our Normals, composed of about 24 to 30 children from Chartclass up to 11 Reader-grade, free of charge, to be conducted on the alterna-ting plan by Normalstudents entirely under the su-pervision of the Normal Professor. The children to be supplied under certain conditions by the four Bishops of Provo. This plan was not endorsed by the General Board just then, but I shall keepmy faith that it will yet be carried out 
 Provo City, August 26   89President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Again I am under the necessity of submitting anenclosed letter to you for the purpose of getting instructionsin regard to further proceedings in the matter. As theletter explains itself I need not refer to the special pointsthere in myself.Bro. Harnes of Kaysville, chairman of the local Boardthere, wrote me about two weeks ago, that Bro. JedediahTaylor, whom I had recommended to them as their Princi-pal for this Seminary, had not sufficiently impressedthem at his visit at Kaysville, and theyproposed, there-fore, to engage him only temporarily for one term.  Thisproposition Bro. Taylor refused to accept, and I wrotethem that I had no teacher for them under such a con-dition as t would be extremely unfair to any teacher tobe set adrift under some pretext, after all schools weresupplied, and he stood a poor chance to get a position.Another thing it would be, if there were just complaintswhich should prove by investigation to be well grounded.They have reconsidered their original proposition,

Upon your advice and instructions on any or all of these stated points will depend my course to a great extent in this Normal Department. Knowing your great sense for justice and equality for all, and at the same time the fin-ancial difficulties surrounding you, I do not make these statements for the purpose of obtaining more means, but to get your direction in regard to the best course for me to pursue in the matter.With kind regardsYour brother in the GospelKarl G.

 Provo City, Febr. 15.  [18]90President Wilford WoodruffDear Brother,In compliance with your instructions I started for PriceStation at D.g RG. Rg, Saturday, Febr. 8, at 1 P.M. having tele-graphed my arrival to Bro. L. M. Olsen, at that place. Arri-ving at Price at 5 P.M. was kindly recieved by Bro. Olsenand hospitably entertained by him until Sunday morn-ing. Starting for Huntington at 5 A.M. arriving at theplace at 9 A.M. met President Larsen of Emery Stake at theresidence of Bro. Howard, his second counsellor, and Presidentof the Stake Board of Education. One hour's conversationbefore the morning meeting convinced me of the existenceof a strong party feeling about the location of the Academy.Huntington or Castle Dale were the [watchwerds], and eachparty endeavored of its influence are in their favor Stating,however, to these bretheren your instructions, that neitheryourself nor the General Board desired to influence themeither way, leaving the settlement of their question entirelyto the Saints of Emery Stake, I had no authority whateverto take sides.  When I found that Presidency of theStake was divided, the Stake Board in its majority lean-ing one way, the High Council in its majority leaning 
 continuedthe other, and that even some bitter feeling was exis-ting, finding expression of in various insinuations andrecriminations, which it would have been extremelyunwise to permit to break out in open Conference.I proposed to President Larsen, to postpone the officialdiscussion of the subject until after the afternoon mee-ting, when he might call a special meeting for thatpurpose, composed of the Stake Presidency, High Coun-cil, Stake Board, and the whole Bishopric of theStake, all the members of these various bodies being repor-ted present. I expected under God's blessing to have oppor-tunity to engender a spirit of unanimity on this sub-ject among the Saints before that Council should meet.The meeting was crowded both in the fore- and in theafternoon, the bretheren making the most of me bothtimes as far as physical effort in talking was con-cerned. The subject of the welfare of the rising genera-tion and our educational system forming the chief-topic of all the discourses by the speakers. The Councilwas as stated above, and by request of Pres. Larsen Ilaid ^before the bretheren^ the principles according to which this wholedeliberation should be conducted. To the great 
 continuedhonor of the bretheren it must be said, that each sidewas represented sincerely, honestly, and in spirit wil-ling to abide by the decision of the whole Council.Once only a voice called for explanations of the causeof all the bad feeling in the past, that was frowned down,however, by the almost unanimous sentiment of themeeting. After Pres. Larsen had several times calledfor more expression of views on the subject, none re-sponding, "[ipoustive]" was called, and the vote taken.Pres. Larsen never committing himself for either sideduring all the proceedings. Votes stood: Huntington 10,Castle Dale 29. One of the bretheren from Huntingtonmoved to have this vote made unanimous, whichwas carried. Seldom has it been my happy lot inmy ministry to witness such a brotherly feeling asthere was mannifested in that Council-Meeting, andI blessed the brotheren in the name of the Lord, tel-ling them, that I should have done the same of thevote had gone the other way, recognizing that theSpirit of God had guided them in their deliberations.The meetings on Monday more equally crowded andblessed with a spirit of anonimity and rejoicing 
 continuedThe Conference sustained the decision of the Coun-cil to have the Academy located at Castle Dale. Onlyfive brothern from Huntington voting against it. With the exception of the rather ominous beginning of mymission on Sunday morning before meeting time,this has been one of the happiest educational visit I have made. The Stake Board of Education met at noon on Monday, accepted Bro. Alexander Jamesonas Principal, voted him a salary of $60 per month, andconcluded to run the Academy for two terms to theend of the schoolyear. I had intended to go over toCastle Dale with the brothern and start the Academy,but very stormy weather having set in during the day,the bretheren thought it better for me to return with Bro.Olsen to Price at once, as it would not be safe to riska return to Price, 22 miles on terrible road, in stormy weath-er this time of year. Arrived at Price at 9 P.M. andreturned to Provo Tuesday morning.With kind regardsYour brother in the GospelKarl G. Maeser 
 Provo city, Febr. 22nd, [18]90President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,The copy of the letter of Bro. Attewall Wootton, Pres.of the Wasatch Stake Board of Education, to President A. Hatch, is before me and has been purused with great care. As I cannot speak by personal knowledgeof the case, but have before me only Principal EnochJorgensen's letter and two printed extracts from the"Wasatch Wave," which do not coincide entirely with Bro. Wootton's report to Pres. Hatch, it reduces itself in my mind to a question of veracity between the statements in my possesion and the proceedings of investigation before the Wasatch S.B.E. As the case hasbeen reported, however, to the General Board by me, I have nothing to remark anymore in regard to the merits of the case. There is a statement, though, in Bro. Wootton'sletter to which I must take exception. He criticises Bro. Jorgensen's action in reporting ^to me^ the disgracefulconduct of a member of the Stake Board, by which the efforts of the Stake Academy in reforming thegeneral spirit of the youth in that neighborhood—were paralyzed to some extent Bro. Wootton con 
 continuedtents that the case should never have gone outside of the Stake. Not mentioning the circumstance that the offence had been known to every member of that Boardfor some time without anything being done about ituntil the General Board demanded an investigation,it was clearly that Principal's duty to ask my advice in the matter, what position he should take in the premises. I did advise Bro. Jorgensen in my answerin following words: "I fully realize, dear Brother, the difficulties of your position in that peculiar Stake of Zion, in fact, I was aware of it before you went there, and,as you know, for this reason the Lord directed me to select you for that position. I have carefully read the two clippings from the " Wasatch Wave" and your own com-mends upon them. It is a serious matter for a member of a Board of Education to disgrace himself in the manner in which Geo. Cluff has done it, and I shall report the circumstance at the meeting of the General Board next Friday, Febr. 7 for instructions." There were some general instructions in my letter to Bro. Jorgensen, which, however, had no direct bearing upon the case, besides being available in their applications to any 
 Provo City,  September 26. 89.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In compliance with your instructions of Sept 7th recievedper telegram, I made appointments for my visits at Far-mington and Kaysville for Sept 11 & 12 respectively.Having a few hours to spare on Tuesday, Sept. 10, betweenmy calls at your office, I spent them visiting the 18Ward L.D.S. Seminary, Horace Cummings, Principal,Mrs. Hardy & Miss Snow, Assistants.  I found the threeclassrooms, thus far occupied well filled with pu-pils, and the recitations in running order.  I found,however, the Daily Pogramms not yet in a settledand well defined order, nor was there a Plan for thevarious classes made out.  The discipline in Bro. Cum-mings' department did not seem to be as yet firm-ly established, while the recitations of the two lady-teachers deserve much commendation in this respect.I have called Bro. Cummings' attention to thesepoints and have received the assurance that Ishall find these draw backs over come at my next visit.  The recitations themselves, how ever, reflectmuch credit upon those three teachers.  The pupil 
 continuedemergency. I am decidedly of the opinion that Bro. Jos-gensen has simply acted in the line of his well definedduty, as much as it was mine to report the case to theGeneral Board. I should very much desire, that Bro. Woottoshould be instructed to that effect, as this case estab-lishes a precedent for similar ones in the future.If the President of that Stake Board and the othermembers are of the opinion that the Principal of theAcademy has overstepped his lines, the position ofBro. Jorgensen becomes to that extent more difficut,than it is already.With kind regardsYour brother in the GospelKarl G. Maeser 
 went through this exercies with spirit attention, andlively interest, showing such progress the short time takeninto consideration.  My next visit will be one whole day,when I shall be able to form a more correct estimateof the spiritual and intellectual standing of the insti-tution.  Wednesday, Sept. 11 I arrived at Farmington intime for the opening of the morning exercises at theDavis Stake Academy, Bro. Joshua Greenwood, Principal,James Steed, & Mr. Welling, Assistant. The students weredivided into three departments, located one in the main-hall of the Meetinghouse and the other two in Council-[shop] [wherf] and vestry.  Considering the somewhatinconvenient arrangement of the passages and studies,and the entire unappropriateness of the locality forschoolpurposes, the order, quickness, and disciplinemaintained by the students did not only reflectvery creditabilty upon the Principal and Teachers, but[madd purified] as much at home with them as ifthat school had been in operation for years in ourchurchschool system.  I attended every recitation inthe fore-and afternoon, alternating between themas circumstances suggested, and cannot 
 too much in praise of the labors of these teachers andtheir Principal. In the afternoon a young Bro. Willerfrom Farmington made his appearance, in the Academy,and took charge of classes in Gen. History, Algebra, andPhysiology in a manner that astonished me, andI recommend that young man to your attention,for there is a rising young teacher in him. I haveadvised Bro. Greenwood to have Bro. Miller applyfor a license as teacher in the Churchschool- service.The Students of that Academy, are full of enthusiasemfor their studies, and go any length for their Principal,as do the Authorities and People of Farmington.President Smith, his counselors, and several mem-bers of the Stake Board of Education met with mealso in consultation about the educational affairsof the Stake especially in regard to the Kaysvilleembroglio. It was arranged that the Stake Presidencyand myself should meet on day ^Thursday^ Sept. 12 at5 P.M. with the Local Board of the KaysvilleSeminary and try to come to an understanding.The new Academy building at Farmington re-flects much credit when the good judgement

Christensen, Principal, and Mrs. Clementine Erickson, Assistant & Lady-teacher. The Seminary occupies theupper story of the Coop-Store, two rooms, commodious,well lighted and ventilated, nicely furnished, separateentrances to each room, aby the liberality of Bro. Madsen,owner of the building, under very resonable conditionsin regard to rent for premises and use of furniture.There can be over 200 student accommodated. 100 students have been in [atten]dance during the two terms the Seminary has been in existance thus far; they wereclassified in a IV and V Reader grade; forming, how-ever, for a start, only one department, called Preparatory.The members of the Local Board have taken a very activepart in the development of their Seminary, realizing thenecessity for their utmost efforts in counteracting theinfluence of the Presbyterian Academy at Mt. Pleasant.Bro. Christensen, the Principal, is one of our most prom-ising Churchschool-teachers, combining his labors inthe Seminary with his appointments in the Sunday- 
 and [energy] of the Authorities and People of thatStake. After schoolhouse at [Farm] City, some membersof the Stake Board, and School [illegible ] students saidmyself meet in the upper room of the Academy.  Prin-cipal and Teachers made their reports and I had toanswer several points of inquiry about manag-ment and organization where I especially accen-tuated the duties of the Lady teacher to regard to herparticular mission in our churchschools.Counsellor Hays took me the same [pruening] inhis buggy to Kaysville in answer to a specialinvitation from that Local Board to attend aSoiree in the Seminary building gotten up forthe purpose of raising some more means forschool furniture and utensils. At the visit and atPres. John R. Barnes we were joined by Presidents Smith andCall of Davis Stake. The new Seminary-building is finishedand reflects much credit upon the enterprise of thepeople of Kaysville and the management of Bro.Barnes, as Chairman of the Board.  It was arranged,that all discussion of the misunderstanding betweenthe stake Authorities and the Kaysville Board 
 should be postpound until the councilormeeting on thefollowing day, in consequence of which arrangment wespent a very enjoyable at that inceedingly will coudor-ted entertainment. The size of the Kaysville Seminary-building is the same as that of Farmington Academy-building with the difference that Farmington is nowbuilding the right wing from the main entrance, whileKaysville has built the left wing. The finishing in-side is tasteful and subsationtial and will be similarin both also. As the Kaysvile Seminary was notready for opening until September 16, I had thetime on Thursday, Sept. 7 at my disposel until5 P.M.  Th. which I thought I could occupy to greater ed-vantage by opening a few hours at the Weber StakeAcademy at Ogden, and took therefore, the morningtrain for that city. Bro. L. F. Moench, Principal andOscar Vance, Assistant, with usual Volunteer [Insuibels]as Tutors, were found busily at work. The attendenceis about 90, for an Academic and In terms [with]and [^I^] [Preparator] Dept. with some academic [word smudged] thisadded. Bro. Moench explained to me he [income]as the comparitively small attendance 
 150 students, is divided into two apartments by a stage-curtain and is tolerably well furnished. The Boardowns a building which has been occupied thus farby the districtschools, but will be taken [po]ssessionof by the Academy in the fall, with prospects of gre someimprovements to insure greater convenience andfacilitates to teachers and students. A lecture by my-self to the Polysophical Society concluded the day.Sunday, March 106 gave me the opportunity of witnessingthe finest work in the organization of a Sunday schoolTheological Class that it ever has been my privilegeto become acquainted with. The credit for which isaccorded by the brethren to the untiring efforts of Bro.Alma Greenwood, that class seems to have collec-ted all the young people of Ephraim, of more matureaged filling the large hall to overflowing; they beingattracted and held there from Sunday to Sunday bythe spirited manner with which the exercises areconducted. An address the afternoon meetingin the Tabernacle, and a lecture in the evening at thesame place concluded my share of that day's work.Monday, March 167, found me spending the whole day inwitnessing the exercises at the Academy, conductedby Principal Greenwood, and his Assistant and Lady-teacher, Miss Carrie Henry. The students are dividedinto a Preparatory and an Intermediate Department,with several students taking advanced studiespreparatory to a Normal Course. All the classes re-cited very creditably, and the spirit and discipline, 
 is in the first place the "Freeschool system, recently inaugure-ted in Ogden, to content against, them the indifference of agreat many leading citizens from among our people,the many other [schoolships]. Seeing that Bros. Moenchand Vance were actually doing good work, and thatthe blame could scarcely be with them, I called on,Apostle F. D. Richards for advice in the matter.  AlthoughBro. Richards was seriously indispossed, he entered at oncewith deep earnest into the subject, and it was thoughtbest to lay this matter before you, if you would notinstruct me, perhaps to confer with Pres. Shurtliff:for the purpose meeting with that Stake Board andthe Faculty, and devise some plan by which the in-terest of the people of Weber Stake could be arousedin the educational movement of the Church forthe welfare of their own sons and daughters askinginstructions you should feel to give me in this re-gard shall be carried out to the best of my abil-ity.

John R. Barner in the chair. Present: The Stake Presiden-cy, Bishop Barton and Councillors, the Members of theLocal Board. Having became posted in general aboutsome existing misunderstanding between the Stake Authori-ties and those of Kaysville, I was expected to open the dis-cussion and was called on by the Chairman to speakfirst. I outlined to the Brothern the mode of proceedurewhich the General Board under your direction hasadopted and while has been my course throughout, [gallos-]trating it from instances occurring in our Church school-Organization, unphasising the fact that the order ofthe Priesthood and the Spirit of the Church was thekeynote of all our operation.

Although one of my mosttrustworthy Normal Graduates has been laboringhere for two years as a teacher in the district-school,having been recommended by me for thatposition, by special request of the Stake Author-ities, it seems that the contrary influences ofthat place are too much for all our efforts.Bro Hayes, the teacher, reported to me, that it hasbeen impossible for him to keep the MutualImprovement Association alive, and he is goingaway now altogether discouraged in regard tothe outlook. That place seems to be a "ForlornHope," and ought to be held at any price.Richfield.Arrived at Richfield, Friday, March 21, and hadto address the by special invitation, the CountyTeachers Association immediately after myarrival, and spent the rest of the day inconversation with Bro. Jos. J. Anderson aboutAcademy-affairs.Saturday, March 21. Went with Pres. Seegmillerand others to Monroe to fill an appointmentfor the evening. The Stake Authorities andBoard of Education deem it advisable to havea churchschool in this place, although the [mans] 
 their Stake President, ever acting upon any advice of hisin their educational movement. In honor to the brethernof Kaysville it must be said, that one after anotheracknowledges his ^and their^ mistakes declaring, if they had under-stood this matter as they did now, this ill feeling andmisunderstanding would never have arisen. Onlyone member seemed to remain unreconciled and saidso. President Smith addressed the meeting with greatform, logic, and feeling, promising to get at the rootof all these hankerings by communening with theHigh Council of the Stake. There certainly was mani-sested in the beginning of the remarks of all theKaysville Brotheren a sentiment of accusations a-gainst the Stake Presidency, which I endeavored to show them, was the very cause of taking them offthe track. The meeting adjourned with the bestof feeling, apparently, between all parties, and thedifficulties amicably settled, pending some pointsto be adjusted here after at the High Counsil.  Byspecial appointment I addressed at 8 P.M. a largeaudience of young people in the interest of edu-cation in the Kaysville Meeting house

By special solicitation of the Ward Authorities I permitted Bro. John Johnson,one of this year's Normal Graduates, and a Church-Normal at that, to teach their district-school thecoming school year. Elsinore being his homethey intend starting a churchschool sooner orlater, when Bro.

Spent the whole day duringschoolhours at the Academy, conducted by Bro.Jos. J.

The Academy occupies the oldmeetinghouse, with four classrooms, and aPrincipal's office, and enjoys all the convenien-ces possible under the circumstances. The or-ganization of the school, the classwork, spirit,and discipline of the school characterize Bro.Anderson as a teacher of much ability, and asbeing ably supported by his Assistants

 Somehow, however, Bro. Anderson has laboredunder the disadvantage of suceeding Bro. Isaac Hayes, who had possessed the hearts of the Au-thorities, the pupils, and the people at large, to anunusual degree. He being different from hispredecessor, and yet being measured by accordingto the latter's standard, my difference was chargedagainst him, and some influential men havingsecretly made up their mind before hand, inspite of my protestation, to have Bro. Hayes backanyway, no matter who succeeded him—allthis combined to operate against Bro. Anderson,obstacles which his own disposition was not cal-culated to remove either. Hence a very un-pleasant scene, entirely undecerved and un-called for at on the at the Boardmeeting in theafternoon took place, in consequence of whichBro. Anderson's labors as Principal of the Sevier S.A.will cease at th[e] [c]lose of the term, and I have prom-ised to sustain Bro. Hayes as his successor, if theBoard can make satisfactory arrangements withhim. In company with Pres.

The Prin-cipal exercising only a general supervision overthe Academy during the first and fourth term,and being actively engaged only in class workduring the second and third terms. This arrange-ment is decided unsatisfactory on generalprinciples, but must be tolerated temperarilyin consideration of the surrounding circum-stances. Bro.

Records of pro-ceedings have been carefully kept and are respectfully submittedin accompanying book. Results thus far obtained show, that15 Candidates have passed ^for^ the Primary Grade, 47 for the Intermediate Grade, and 3 as Specialists in Music.The Board of Examiners had held several consultations pre-vious to the appointed times for examinations, to decide uponthe propositions and the general mode procedure, minutes of which deliberations have also been recorded in the book beforeyou.Owing to the serious illness of Bro. Talmage, Bro. BenjaminCluff jr. recently returned from Michigan University, acted, accord-ing to your instructions, as Assistant Examiner, taking spea-cial charge of the examination-exercises at Salt lake City,while Bro. Tanner conducted those at Logan, and I thoseat Gunnison, Cedar, and Provo, although attending also 
 to study hard outside of schoolhours, preparatoryto his expected responsibilities. But althoughhe has done most excellent work in the lowergrade, his advancement in his studies is not yetmarked enough to notify me in recommendinghim to the Principalship for next year, and thetime of probation must be extended. The Boardhave sent me a petition to nominate him as Prin-cipal, he being quite popular, but mere popu-larity and efficient primary work are not theonly essential qualifications of a Principal.The Beaver Stake Board of Education have in cor-porated, bought a lot in town, have the foundationlaid for an Academy-building, and hope tohave it ready for occupancy in the fall. The planis good. Two story-building; seatingroom for 250 students.

Jensen has given entire satisfaction,the people looked longingly back to Bro. Oscar Vance, their former teacher, until now laboringas teacher in the Weber S. Academy at Ogden, andBro. Jensen himself, being a married man, desiresto be nearer Sanpete, the home of his relatives.Bro. Jensen goes, but Bro. Vance does not comeback as he intends to take a course of higherstudies at the L.D.S. College. This arouses the breth-eren at Parowan to start at once a church school,for which I will have to find a Principal.Cedar CityTuesday, April 22 left for Cedar where I had to fillan appointment to address in the new beautifulTabernacle the people in the evening.Wednesday, April 23. spent the day during schoolhours the exercises at the Stake Academy, conduc-ted by the Principal Bro.

 at Logan and Salt Lake part of the time.This being the first experiment of the kind in our Church-school-Organization, a great many difficulties had to be over-come and much patience and persuasion to be broughtinto requisition in order to accomplish the object in view,namely to lay a sure foundation of efficiency in our Church-school-Service.As the manuscript list of Percentages now before you showsseveral vacancies as yet it has been impossible for the Board of Examiners to determine the Percentage of "General Efficiency."Several of the candidates were not able to attend the regular ex-aminations in consequence of which special examinations eith-er in writing or oral had to be held, involving a large am-ount of correspondence. The Board of Examiners asks here-by for instructions, whether the "General Efficiency" should bedetermined upon the Percentages obtained thus far, andor whether it should be left open until next year, untilthe Certificates be made out accordingly.By As instructed, Bro. Benjamin Cluff jr. is now engagedto have his academic diploma as Bachelor of Mathematicsand Didactics (BMD) corresponding to his diploma from theMichigan University as B.S. and will submit it to the Presidentfor signature in due time.In addition to the items contained in my letters of July 24, Sept. ^5 and^ and Sept. 250, ^all^both addressed to the Secretary Bro.

I have visited the Church schools at Nephi, Provo,Huntington, Castle Dale, Cottonwood, 14 Ward, 18 Ward, andthe L. D. S. College since the opening of the school season, metwith the Seventies, Boards, and in several instances alsowith the people of the respective districts in public meetings.Several schools have started in August, some in September,some before Conference in October, and some intend star-ting Oct. 13 and 20. The establishment of special theologicalclasses for children not attending church schools has been made one of the subjects of my remarks to the people. A course of instructions from the General Board is one of the essentialrequirements for this movement. In connection with this I recommend also to the General Board the imme-diate consideration of the report of the Ladies' Committee.In consideration of the importance of vocal instructionsin our church schools, I have requested that all Lady-Normals in our Normal classes should make thatbranch one of their specialties.

Theexercises conducted by Bro. Nephi Savage, as Prin-cipal, Bro. Frank Woodbury, Assistant, & Mrs. Ro-seinia Jarvis, Assistant, and by two Normal-stu-dents with single classes, were exceedingly creditable.But Mrs. Jarvis as Lady-teacher, has not worked upsufficient courage to commence a course ofspecial instructions to the lady-students, adeficiency which I hope will be overcome inthe future with the help of the general instruc-tions to be published by our General LadiesCommittee, for the guidance of all ourLady Teachers throughout the Organization.From among the many interesting remarks madeby the Members of the Board, Stake- and Temple-Authorities present at the occasion, I only statethe one as characteristic of the spirit of thewhole school, viz: "That it had not be found ne-cessary to establish any special domestic regula-tions for the students outside of school, as theirconduct had been conceded by all to be so that they enjoyed the fullest confidence of [Board since][illegible] of it is the highest testimonial that canbe given to any school in point of worshipSaturday April 26, addressed by spirit I invite [illegible]& [illegible] school-teacher.

 Immediately after my visits to the church schools in the North, it will become necessary to attend the church schoolsat St. Johns, Snowflake, and St Joseph, Arizona, that havenever been visited, and are clamoring for a visit. The dis-tance I would entail ^cause^ expenses which I could not venture to in-cur without special instructions from the General Board.The irregularity with which many of our church schools have commenced this year's operations have in several instancesproved disadvantageous to our interests, in as much as somevery efficient teachers could not afford to wait until so latein the season before the schools to which I had assignedthem would open, and I had to grant them the privilegeof accepting positions in district–schools. Some are askingnow for teachers after all available talent has been disposedof.Karl G. Maeser, Gen. Supt.P. S.

If so that opportunity should not besuffered to pass by in securing it, and not let-ting it go into the hands of our enemies.There is, however, ^throughout the whole Stake^ a very pronounced feeling a-gainst the ^permanent^ location of the Stake Academy atFillmore, they prefer Holden for that end.It will require the advices of President Wood-ruff to guide the people in the solution of theproblem.

 Constantinople, Sept 1st 1898.President Wilford Woodruff and Counsellors,Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A.Dear Brethern, When I last reported to you I was at Sivas. I at once left for Zara to visit the Branch of our church there. I found them very faithful and filled with the love of the Gospel. They were, of course, very anxious to gather, and were very happy in the thought that the Lord would soon open up de liverence for them from bondage. They are not so hard up for food as are the saints in Aintab, but they are more in thraldom which makes life tiresome. The hope which the Gospel gives is their life. Elder Nishan Sheriman presides.He is a faithul man & much beloved of the saints. He is also respected of the outsiders & of the Government. The prospects there are not flattering, a few are investigating. They were very fortunate in not having to go through the massacre. The saints fasted & prayed for seven days when they noticed preparations for slaughter & God heard their prayers & delivered the town from destruction, for which they are very thankful.They plad with me continually to ask the Brethern in Zion not to forget them, that they might also be gathered to some place where they could learn more of the ways of the Lord and help to build up His Kingdom. A circumstance happenedwhile at Zara which impressed me with a new idea about traveling & preaching the Gospel in Turkey. I was for a little while mistaken for an English Consul. From the whole af- 
 F. F. HintzeJune 21 [18]98Sivas, Asia Minor, June 21 [18]98President Wilford Woodruffand CounsellorsSalt Lake City, Utah,Dear Brethern,  June the19th Brother Nishan Sherinian andmyself reached safely this city after arather remarkable expeirience.According to instructions from Apos-tle Lund I started north emediatlyafter his leaving Haifa for Zion.At Beyrout I mailed him someinformation including a map ofEl gere, the villige for sale, all of whichI learn by letter from him has safelyreached him at Islington 42.  As hewill present that part of our workI will not mention it here.May 23rd We arrived at Allepo (Halep)And found President Maycock & ElderLarsen together with the saints well & happy.  During the week we were envi-ted to a discussion with the Catholics 
 -fair I understood that if I were careful to notify my Consul of my intended trip and obtained a Gen I'armefrom the Government, that I could travel & stay at pleasure without trouble. To prove this I determined on a trip to Gürünewhere I knew the Government did not want any foreigners to go if they could help it. As soon as I arrived at Sivas I turned my pass over to my consul Dr. Jewet who treated me with ^consideration^. He sent it by the Dragoman to the Government who fix it O.K. and gave me a guide. I also asked him to inform the Kaimakam at Gürüne of my coming. When I arrived at Gürüne I had perfect liberty, was treated with respect by the officials and met only the opposition which our presence always produces with the Protestants. The experiment was a success. It was said that several were ready to be baptized but I did not so find it. There were good peopleand investigators, and probably those who would have been baptized had not the Protestants raised such a storm.Brethern, the breaking loose from this world is hard every where, but it is harder where no political rights are enjoyed. neither have we had any formal acknowledgement from the Government so that we could offer the needed protection. I know we say have faith in the Lord, do right and obey the gospel and let the consequences follow. But that is hard for them to do ^who^ have, as a rule, but little moral force of character. Much less than a century ago they were ignorant priest-ridden Armenians. Now the Protestants have enlightened them alittle. They are far from possessing that courage and stability which our fathers have transmitted to us, and which they possessed long before we heard the Gospel, Many are 
 in an anti chamber of the ChaldeanCatholic church of Aleppo. We excepted theinvitation. And for two evening we werediscussing the question of athe Original Sin.Many were present and we hope muchgood was done, yet you know the Catholicsatre, as a rule, not open to conviction. Itwas more remar^k^able because we wereenvited to a catholic Church. They suposedthe victory easy, but found on the lastend that the question envolved a great dealwhich they could not explain away. Iwas much troubled because I had tospeak through an enterpretor.On May 29th we had the pleasure tobaptize 8 persons. Several were personsof good families.June the first we arrived at Aintab &the following Sunday, fast day, we baptized5 persons, One of whom is ^a^ man of somestanding, his children ^are^ well educated. A-nother leading man is redy to be baptized.The step is a great trial to them. Everyeffort is being made by the Protestantsto hinder new members from joining. 
 honest and good, but thy need the same development as we have to do as we do. They have not inherited the experience, the self reliance nor the development of moral thought & courage that we inherited from our parents, and which is in-creased & intensified in us by the knowledge of the gospel & by the free institutions with which we are invironed.At Gürüne I met a Gentleman from Albistan about 75miles south of there. He ^is^ what is called a Campbellite. He was quite interested and told ^me^ of a little church in Albistan which are seeking for truth. But his position was like the others. He asked, are you recognized? I told him no. He urged recognitionas did the others. The dominant churches over tax our people,They annoy them in numerous ways so that to step out to begin anew takes courage. The Zara Aintab & Alepo branches were organized before the lines were drawn so sharply. I therefore earnestly plead with you, my Brethern, that you do all you can for our Brothers and Sisters in GTurkey. In their present condition they will need help continually, but if they can be gathered out to one place they will evidently soon improve as they are smart & apt to adopt new ideas & practices. That you did not at once adopt our report and decide to buy the Gire' property did not suprise me, indeed, had you done so I should have been suprised. But it was all we could seein the short time we were investigating. We were looking more for what we wanted, pr. instructions, than for what we could get.I am now looking for what we can get and where we can get it. My observations will be reported promptly to you from time to time.And if we cannot now locate in the "Jackson County" of Pale-stine, I supose we can go to the "mountains" or some other 
 their houses are visited, All mannerof vile stories are told. The families areshamed down ^& made fierce opposers to the men^ telling them that it wouldbe better that they became Muhammedansor that they should commit some crimeand be inprisoned than to join such anorganization of out laws. They site withsome force the fact that we are not rec-congnized by the Government of Turkey,while this is true it is certainly no crime;still it is being worked to a good advantagewhich you will see by the following accountof our trip north. At Aintab our land-lord has been rather dilatony about fixingup outr room according to agreement &it bothers us some, but he will probablymake it right on the last end. It is notso easy to accomplish just what you wanthere owing to the poor mail & transpor-tation service in this land.  Then maybehe also feels this as we are not recognized weare not very dangerous. Regcogniztion au-thority or a display of power is a great thingin this land of despotism. People are so cowedor bowed down that it is hard for a foreignor to understand. 
 place until we can, and there prepare the people to buildup the Centre Stake in the Orient. We do not need to go so far, All we need to do is to brave the danger of frontier life as we did in Utah, and we can get plenty of Good land & water almost for nothing. Syria is large, but Mesopotania with its ancient water canal systems is empty & iddle. I am told by those who know that there is not finer country in the world, But ^it^ is well inland. Yet Uncle Sam backed by the Lord is good enough for anybody. Since seeing what I have on this trip my language is quite insufficient to express my gra titude to God for America & her institutions, even aside from what I know of the gospel. I shall, however, do nothing except by your authority, but I have not lost hope in the Ottoman Government giving us land on easy terms now that we are not opposed by our own U.S. officials. They used to oppose us now we have their assistance. I am told by Mr. Allaimby U. S. Marshall to Turkey, that the Legation here 10 years ago wentso far as to tell the Porte that we were not acknowledge as a church at home and that they could not protect us. The Portesnubed them nicely by giving them to understand that we would have the same recognition & protection as others. This was most agreable news to me. The Marshall said it was on file at the Legation & if I can secure a copy of it I will send it to you.Mr Allaimby has visited Utah, and has in his possession a letter from President John Taylor. He offered me any needed as-sistance in his power, For which I was thankful.Since coming to Constantinope I have labored with the question of recognition. I move slow & I find it Benificial.Dr. Angel, the Minister received me kindly but left at once 
 After encouraging the saints to faith-fulness at Aintab & having arrangedall matters as best we could we left Presi-dent Maycock & the Saints June the 7thfor [Shusni Mansur] whence we had re-ceived a number of pressing invitationsto come and baptize etc. Our caravanbeing a large one we had no police orsoldier with us. In four days we arrivedsafely & found that the whole town wasin one stir about us and our coming.The wildest rumors about our givingmany wives & much money to all whowould join had deceived many who hadsuch bugs in their brains. Could we havecomplied with their wish we could havedone great business. But when they foundour business of a quite different nature,that we required faith & works, that wereceived from members, tithing etc, & did notgive the whole thing flatened with that crowd.In the mean time we had been visitedby the police, my teskere (pass) & books hadbeen taken to the police station, and a chargeor suspicion had been trumped up by the 
 (second sheet)for the United States. The Charge d'Affaires, Mr JohnRiddle has assited me very willingly. He at once sent a dragoman to the Government ^to find out^ how to proceed in this matter, and finally we were refered to the Minister of Religions, Mr. Ziver Bey. He remembered me from former visits. He explained to us that it was nessesary first to send the petition to Alepo and have it signed by the native Elders of our Church, then to the Vali who would investigate if we had a people there and certify to the findings. Then the petition would come here and be considered by the sublime Porte. This government could not recogni-ze us as we are foreigners but it would consider a petition fromits own citizens. He promised his assistance. He has read and formally excepted the petition with a slight correction and it is now ready to sent to Sivas & Alepo. Please find a copy with thisreport in seperate envelope marked A.Just at the time of getting up this petition I was in a littletrouble how to begin and where to get assistance. Mr. Riddle presented me with a ticket to go to Selamlik, to see the Sultan drive to the Hamidiea Mosque to prayer. I attended and upon my return I was hailed by Brother Binyad, our Greek brother & a sort of lawyer by profession. We were so pleased to meet. After investigating his condition I sent him to find out from some high officials all he could of how we should proceed & he returned a report identical with Ziver Bey's advise. He at once struck up a plan or form which was excepted as above stated.Ziver Bey & the Legation people promised such aid as we would need when the petition comes back. And Mr. Garqiula the Legation enterpreters presence upon each visit gave a greatdeal of force to my position. 
 Protestants & the Government to gather thatwe were agitators. They telegraphed to theMutesarif at Malatia who ordered us sentthere. As a foreingnor I refused to be confirmedor even to acknowledge arrest and it seemsthat they did not dare to handle me roughly.I went in and ^out^ of the police room as I pleased& told them that they could choose one outof two, either let me live at the khan, werewe had a room, until they got ready or sendme at once as I possitively refused to gowillinging into confinement without acharge ^complaint^. They chose to send us at once & in ashort time we were sent out of town, ahorse back at our own expence, under twogaurds to Malatia, Of course we suffereda great deal of indignity from a worldlystandpoint but we were happy. BrotherNishan proved a great healp to me as hewas used to such indignities has advisehad a good effect. My obstainasy saved usfrom further trouble & in two days, wei. e. part of three days travel we were atMalatia. The road, or trail, was of the roughestI ever traveled & still entitlled to the name of 
 As these men at the Legation & General Consulate wouldnot take any backshish for services, I offered them a Book of Mormon as a present from the Church. They seemed very much gratified with the proposition & would except the books with thanks. I have therefore ordered a Book of Mormon for Mr. Garqiula & a Voice of Warning for Mr. Dimitri adus of the General Consulate, from Bern as they desire French.I hope you will approve of this as it is an easy, and may be a benificial way to remember them and to show our appricia-tion of their assistence which we may need much more in the future. The cash expences of the petition will be about five^eight^ Dollars.I called on Mr. Dickensen Consul General To Turkey. He received me very cordially & answered my questions without reserve.He said that America had better treaty rights with turkey than any other nation, and that we were perfectly secure in property holding in Turkey, that is, said he, as secure as ^a^ governmeent like this can make it. He said the Turkish Government lived up to the treaty better than the Americans, & that he was sorry that there were some Americans who seem to think it an honor if they could defy the Turks or say something to offend them under the Juristection of the U.S. Government. Mr. Dimitriadus, the vice Consul & sec. of the Consulate has furnished me a copy of the protocal & enterpretation of our priviledges relating to property rights, and security from interference by Turkish officials. The copy is also made part of this report and is marked B.I would ask these questions. Is the gathering limited to Palestine? And further, Shall I look toward a petition to the Porte for land for our saints if we are successful with the petition for recognition? 
 malil route. Over mountain passes, downwashout's, crossing several ranges thetrail being many places very dangerous.At Malatia we were soon released, ortold there was no change. We were told we werenot arrested but that as the road was unsafe (also true) we were only gaurded fromthe robbers etc. This was a cute explaina-tion. My pass & books had been seized &sent here under double seal. I gave themto understand I quite knew the differencebetween arrest & liberty. It was clearthat we were not entirely free as the Mu-tesarif desierd we should lodge in thebarracks telling us it was better that thefilthy khan. I thanked him but toldhim if I was free I would go to the khana little discussion issued between themselves,and the police commissioner, who proved tobe a gentlemen, came & told us we mightgo to the Khan. They evidently were figuringon some plan to let us go, which is not theeasiest thing in the world in this land wereno one seems to know just what to do es-pecially in cases envolving foreignors. 
 I ask these questions now that I may receive an answer in time to continue my labors when I come back to Constantinople if required. I expect to leave this week for Palestine to see the Gire' property & Palestine in Sept. according to the instructions from Apostle Lund. Afterwards I will go north to Alepo to help the petition work there. And if you think proper I will investigate chances for land in Northern Syria. As for the natives I see no more to fear from themthan we had to fear from the Indians in Utah. There are difficulties but they can be overcome by the Lord's assistance.Go where we will and we shall find difficulties to surmount but if we begin right by sending enough foreigners to our place of settlement to beget confidence & ^to^ establish respect and confidence in the movement we will soon be alright. Aforeign hat is a great power in Turkey.A friend and investigator Mr. Negro, a Polish Gentlemenof fine education & attainments came here as an exile fromPoland. He is now a Turkish subject & has worked for yearsfor them as an ingeneer. He also states that there is plenty of land to be had in Syria & that good tittles can be had. A little backshish is needed. Then let a man who is a citizen & in whom we have confidence buy & imidiately transfer to an American. He has extensive experience in land matters. I became aquainted with him 10 years ago and he seems like and exceedingly good man.In regard to the mission in General I believe it is progressing favorably. The probability of a place of gathering gave a good deal of new life and energy as it does in all countries. This is natural to the Gospel. 
 We left the barracks, however, & went tothe Khan were we found to our surprisethat we had a guard placed over us. Iat once sent a nother soldier to notify thegovernment that I positively objected toany such indignity. The soldier was prompt-ly removed. It was some time before wecould decide washat was coming next. Butit soon dawned on us that the Mustesarifhad telegraphed the Govenorrnor at Kharpootfor instructions. The Vali telegraphed backthat in as much as we were desirous ofgoing to Sivas not to hinder us, but togive me back my books, & examine anyArmenian papers found. This was com-plied with. Our Armenian writings wereendorsed O. K. by the Commissionor.So far so good, but it was not untiltwo days out from Malatia that we werenoright sure that we were not in some un-derhanded way being sent to Sivas. But oneof the Gen I'arneo hwho ackcompanied us wasinduced to show us his papers by speakingof the general method of protecting travelors.This was a great relief to us. As I was all the 
 New hopes have been engendered by this prospects of the realization of the promises to the House of Israel.  I have not heard whether or not Brothers Vizirian and Nadjarian have been released from prison, but they are reported as bearing faithful testamonies in their cell in Diarbekr and they have found believers, Those men are very energetic.I would reco^m^mend that one or two more experienced Elders be sent here. And that each Utah Elder traveling has a native Brother as his assistance. The native Bro-ther to act as interpretor, He can do the preaching, as a rule,better than we. It also helps to put the Utah Elder in good standing before the Government & people. The actual expence of keeping a native Elder is not much. And alone the native can do nothing. The situation has entirely changed since the massacre. Natives are under restrictions all the time & are not safe from arrest unless in the imploy of some foreignor. And Foreingners must put themselfves in a position to hold the respect of the people by the dignity & authority which our treaties and consular aid affords, otherwise we are liable to arrest and much trouble. We hope this condition will soon change but until then we must proceed in some such way to preach the Gospel in Turkey. Turkey is a peculiar country with peculiar laws and customs, & very strange ways of inforcing them as few persons under stand the laws. But if they think you are in Good standing inStamboul or well backed by your own Government they look upon you as Lords. And it is very profitable & convenient to have them continue to think so. A show of superiority seems necessary. The people here must look up to some authority

Nishan should be taken from mein anyway it m^i^g^ht^ prove a heaard case for him, besides hurting his enfluence atZara, his home, where hise is the leadingChristian citizen. We are thankful thatGod delivered us & that at this writing we^have^ passed police examination and all is well.It is awful to think that men whose actsare strickly honest & whose conscience isclear & who try earnestly to comply withthe law of the land shall still fear & trembleat meeting & officer lest something unfore-seen shall turn up and one be mistrusted.At Husni Masur a good and faithfultestomony was left to hundreds. At Ma-latia only little was done beyound destributingtrack. We felt that our liberty depended largelyupon our leaving town soon so we leftat once otherwise we would have been sentto Kharpoot the  Governor's seat and of thecase had been augmented from there toConstantinople. The lower officers at Husni 
 Mansur tryed hard to fix suspicionon my journal. This they could not read& it came back unread. While it is free from anything obnoxious to the Ottoman GovernmentYet it contains much important matterpertaining to our special mission whichmight for a while have put me in ^a^ wronglight & done us injury. but all is now well.This trap was set by the College people atAintab of whom Bro. Lund will tell you.they have notified their preachers near& narefar of our intentions of visiting theircities. They have been instructed to notify thecity authorities that we are sedicious & un-recognized therefore have not rights.Theis was a smart trick. We have beentold the whole scene by Army officers & others who deplored our fate but could nothelp us. Now that it is over it is clearto me that the time is ripe for an ap-plication to become recognized. This ex-perience wisely used will furnish anexcelent-opening wedge. Not as a complaintbut as a reason to our Minister at Con-stantinople to whom I hold a special 
 (third sheet)in man which they themselves do not possess. Whenthey see a superiority then they are humble and submissive.This is their education for centuaries, with them it is second nature. If we try to be their equals, as the Gospel teaches, and as we would naturally like to be, we destroy our influence, To the members we may be what the Gospel teaches, but to the others we must appear above.I thank you for the appropriation fo the schools in Turkey. At Zara a young sister is instructing the children of the saints & it works very well. I have not heard ^what^ is being done at Aintab aboout the school.Bread has gone up at Constantinope and it is possible our Saints at Aintab will have to be assisted as they will undoubtedly be short of food when winter comes.Work is so poor that it seems at best as though it would keep no one. They manage, however, if they can only find work. I think the saints in Livas & Zara will not suffer.The crops are good there, bread is cheap & work better than at Aintab. The saints at Haifa continue the same.Sister Hilt continues unwell I am sorry to say. She is the soul of that branch.Personally I am well as I believe President Maycock & Elder Larsen are. Individually I feel well in the Gospel & take great pleasure in my labors. Yet I confessthat the trial to leave home & family has been much greater this time than ever before. And then I feel a great responsibility connected with this whole mission. So long as I had the pleasant copmpany and advise of Apostle Lund I was all right but now I feel lost often 
 in these ever changing conditions.In conclusion I would ask you kindly to write me a few lines to Alepo c/o Dr Arminag.That I may know your wish about some of these important questions.  Also that President Wells be notified of the monies we are allowed from time to time so that we will meet with no trouble in obtaining them when needed.

 Provo City, November 11, [189]1President Wilford Woodruff.Chairman General Board of Education.Dear Brother,In compliance with your isntructions concerning myeducational tour to the church schools in Arizona, Ihave written to the each of the Presidents of Snow-flake, St. Johns, St. Joseph, and Maricopa Stakes,placing myself at their disposal during the timeof my stay in their respective Stakes to fill anyappointments they should deem proper to makefor me in the interest of our church schools, ReligionClasses, Sunday schools, & M. I. Associations.The program of this tour is as follows:Wednesday, November 18.  Start from Provo to HolbrookNovember 18—21.  Railroad from Provo to Holbrook.[November] 21—24.  Snowflake.[November] 25. Going to St. Johns.[November] 26—29.  incl.

 Two new Seminaries have been reported to have beenorganised with the sanction of their respectiveStake Boards.  The first is at Escalante, Gar-field County, for which, by request, I have nom-inated this day Bro. Martin I. Bushman, a Normalof the B. B. Y. Academy.  The second is at WestJordan, Salt Lake Co. As I have not yet beenofficially notified by that Local Board, butonly by Counsellor Jos. E. Taylor in privateconversation, I cannot make a definite appoint-ment, but have selected in my mind Bro.Eugene Hart, of Bloomington, Idaho.  Bro. Hart wasuntil recently a teacher on the Bear Lake Stake Ac-ademy, Paris, but had to discontinue with theother teachers, except the Principal, on accountof the financial embarrassment of that in-stitution.Ever praying for the blessings of theLord to rest upon you, I remainWith kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G.

 Provo, September 12th [189]1President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Bro. James E. Talmage has just now left me after explainingto me your approval of the plan of having ^gotten up^ a series of textbooksfor the three grades of religions instructions in our Churchschools,Sundayschools, Primaries [et. et.] When Bro. Talmage first sugges-ted this idea to me, I saw at once the great benefits that wouldprobably be derived from such a step, in as much as I haverealized for a long time the want of a religious textbookconstructed upon correct Normal principles. Hence myenthusiastic endorsement of the Sunday school Leaflets,the first real step in that direction. With great joy I learned,therefore, of your approval of Bro. Talmage's plan, which hehad laid before you upon my suggestion. Consideringalso the many difficulties which the introduction of theReligion-Classes is encountering in some Stakes, amongwhich the want of proper methods is the most promin-ent, the publishing of suitable textbooks would removemany objections that have been raised against thiswise move of the First Presidency. The ReligiousClasses is a supplement ^and effect^ to the secularisation of our district-schools have become a necessity in 
 those Stakes of Zion, or Bishop's Wards, where theschools are in the hands of the opponents to theLatterday Work, and where Sunday schools and Primaries, can with these new textbooks as guides,would prove too feeble bulwarks against the flood-of evil influences bearing down upon our childrenduring the whole working school directed by inmany cases professionally efficient teachers ^but opposed to our faith^. In someStakes also noble work has already been donein those Religion-Classes, promising a further de-velopment, especially when assisted by those booksin contemplation, the results of which cannot bemeasured by human calculation.The question of authorship appears to me verysimple as for the qualification is concerned, inas much as we have no educational author thusfar among as equal to Dr. James E. Talmage.If he shall find time for this work depends en-tirely upon the direction of the First Presidency.I shall take great pleasure in rendering all possibleassistance in this work, but Bro. Talmage ought tobe the man to do it.I have looked over with Bro. Talmage the manu-script for Gen. Circ. No. 7, and approve fully of his suggestions.Bro. Woodbury has been recalled to Farmington andwill see that your daughter Mary gets there also. Hestaid with me here yesterday.With kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser. 
 Provo City, April 13. [189]1President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In conversations held separately with Bros. Howard andSeeley, Counselars of President Larson of Emery Stake, duringConference, and by letters from Bro. Eli A. Day, Principal of theirStake Academy, I discovered such a hopeless case of disunionexisting in the Stake Board of Education, that steps leadingto an improvement in this state of affairs become imperative.Both Principals, the one of the Stake Academy at Castle Dale, andthe other of the Seminary at Huntington are completely discouraged.The latter has quit already and has gone home, and the formerwants to quit at the end of this term, and intends to attend^ the NormalCourse at the B.Y. Academy for a term or two, if he shallget a chance.  He has been arrested again during Confer-ence on the ongoing charge, having served already a term inthe pen.  It appears from all that I can learn, that theold jealousy between Huntington and Castle Dale, especiallyon the part of the former place, led by Bros. Howard andJohnson, is handicapping all the operations of the StakeBoard, of which Bro. Howard is the nominal President.Bro. Larsen, the Stake President, being no member of the Boardat all on account of some mistaken modesty of his. 
 As this is a matter concerning Board affairs I have no authorityto give instructions, but report the case to you. Counselor Seelyimplored me to see that something be done, and I promised himthat I would lay this case before for you, so that relief fromthis strained condition of affairs could be obtained.With kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser1. P.S. Bros Geo. W. Ingram, of Mesa, and Geo. A. Crosby, of St. George,have been placed on the Beneficiary list of the Normal Dept. ofthe B.Y. Academy for next year, as director, and been dulynotified of the fact.K.G.M.2. P.S. I enclose letter from Randolph which explains itself.What and how shall I answer Bro. Larsen?KGM. 
 Provo City, January 19th [189]2President Wilford WoodruffDear Brother,At an official visit I paid yesterday to the BrighamYoung Academy, taking notes, attending the recitations ofthe teachers, and meeting with the Faculty after schoolin special session, of which proceedings I shall makedue report to you in connection with my report of mysouthern circuit commencing with today—I foundthat all the teachers of the Brigham Young Academy,teaching academic studies, are using officially the title"Professor" on the bulletin-boards and elsewhere inthe Academy. As this is against the rule adopted bythe General Board of Education, laid down in GeneralCircular No. 7, page 5, I objected to this at the Faculty-meeting. None of these teachers, except Professor Cluff,who has his Diploma, holds even a License for theseacademic studies. Several of them have handed to melast night their applications for Licenses in their re-spective academic studies, endorsed by Prof. Cluff asPrincipal. I have filled out blanks accordingly andsubmit them herewith respectfully for your con-sideration. These teachers solicit the permission of 
 the General Board to use the title "Professor" on thestrength of these Licenses, as they are ready to passtheir examination for the "Academic Degree" nextspring.According to your instructions to submit myopinion on all pending questions in Church Schoolmatters, I venture to state, that this question does notconcern the teachers of the Brigham Young Academyalone, but can be applied to the Colleges at Salt Lake and Logan as well. The granting of therequest of the B.Y.A. teachers would necessitate,therefore, some modification of the paragraphin the Gen. Circ. No. 7, above alluded to.I shall return from Fillmore to Provo, Friday,Jan. 29th, when I should be pleased to receiveany instructions from you on this point, orcan call on you any day between January 30 andFebruary 1st.With kind regardsYour brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser

 Provo City, March 2d [189]2President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,According to program submitted in my letter to Bro. Reynolds,January 15, I have visited in the interest of our Church SchoolOrganization the Stakes of Juab, Millard, Emery, Sanpete, and Sevier from January 19 until February 26; attended during that period the Stake Academies at Nephi, Fillmore, Castle Dale,Ephraim, and Richfield, and the Seminaries at Hunting-ton, Manti, and Gunnison, spending in each of these schools one whole day, from the opening exercises in the morning until the closing exercises in the afternoon; taking notes, examining the the records required in Gen. Circ. No 7, page 17;met with the respective Faculties for consultation; and met also with the Stake and the Local Boards to ascertain the condition of their general affairs.  Appointments by the Stake Superindendents for me to address public meetings were made at Nephi, Fillmore, Meadow, Kanosh, Deseret, Scipio, Holden, Huntington, Castle Dale, Ferron, Orangeville,Ephraim, Manti, Gunnison, and Richfield, at all of which occasion our Church Schools and Religion Classes werethe leading subjects; Sunday Schools, Primaries, and MutualImprovement Associations, as corroborate institutions, re-

 ceiving due attention in all my public addresses.The school's, without one exception, have been betterpatronized than the previous year and a marked progress toward permanency is observable in all of them.  The only drawback is the financial embarrass-ment under which some of them are laboring yet.There is one feature, however, to which I take the liber-ty of calling the attention of the General Board for the earliest possible consideration viz:  The annual change of Principals in many of our Church Schools, in con-sequence of which such schools can never ^hope to^ emerge out of the experimental stage and to reach a leading po-sition ahead of the District Schools at least not to a very pronounced degree.  The main reason is the comparatively poor salary, and the absence of any pro-spective improvement in this regard, forcing us to supply these schools every year or so with new be-ginners, as their predecessors are compelled to seek for better chances elsewhere.  A proposition has suggested itself to my mind which, if it can be car-ried out, might circumvent this difficulty.  I should suggest an addition to any Principal's salary after five years' service in one school, and so on after every five yearsmore until a stipulated maximum should be reached.With kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser, Gen Supt 
 Provo City, March 21st [189]1President Wilford WoodruffDear Brother,Last Thursday morning I presented the two letters to Pres. A. O. Smoot andto Bro. George Cluff respectively.  The latter intends acknowledging the recieptof his letter forth with, but with the former some very earnest conversationensured, a report of the main features of which I herewith respectfullysubmit. Calling at Pres. Smoot's office Thursday morning after mailtime,I found him and Bros. D. John and H. H. Cluff, a waiting me being,it appears, privately advised by Bro. B. Cluff that some important com-munication was to be made to them.  After the reading of your letter,feeling began to run very high, and the message of Pres. Geo. Q. Cannondelivered by me verbatim did not seem to carry any conviction withit.  The arguments of the Bretheren of thie Stake Presidency was as fol-lows:  1. Whenever a young man of talent had been made an efficientteacher in the B.Y. Academy, he had been taken away, the school leftin a crippled condition until some  one else became qualified to be taken away in his turn, vide Bros. Tanner, Talmage, Maeser, andnow Cluff. 2. The B. Y. Academy were the mother institution of our churchschools the most of whom were conducted by Graduates of this insti-tution; she had proved her integrity to the First Presidency and to wholeIsrael, and it would not be wise to break down a welltriedinstitution for the sake of building up an experimental one.

That thedeeds and consequences of the real estate were now in the hands ofthe Board of Trustees, and that the latter had receised very encouragingassurances from all the leading businessmen of Provo, in andout of the Church, to support them in their efforts to dispose ofreal estate at once, and finish the new Academy-building, butthat all these efforts would be frustrated, as soon this new blowat the prosperity of the institution would become known.  That thepeople would say there were no use trying to do anything here,for the Authorities at Salt Lake wouldwill continue to take alwaysour best men away.I suppose that the Board of Trustees will meet here next week,when it is intended to have your letter discussed and answeredofficially.  My report is merely for the purpose of posting you inregard to the prevailing sentiments here in regard to this matter.Not sharing myself the spirit of despondency in this case, but seeing that I could make no impression upon the Stake Presi-dency, I invited all the teachers of the B. Y. Academy to a privateconsultation at my office, yesterday afternoon.  Except Bro. B. Cluff,all were present and each expressed his determination to standby the Academy now, although the most had intended to re-sign at the end of the schoolyear before anything of thecontemplated change was known.

 Provo City, May 26th [189]1President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In as much as the time for our Annual Church SchoolConvention is near at hand, it becomes my duty to submitto you a few suggestions for your consideration to instructmembers of the General Board present at the occasion to bringwhat extent they might bring before the Convention anyor all of them, or other points of importance which youmay desire to have them speak upon.1. It has been noticed with regret that several ChurchSchools have not yet made arrangements that the copies of theJuvenile Instructor, containing the "Church School Papers",are kept on file for reference, in consequence of which omis-sion many of our Church School Teachers are kept in ignoranceof this content.2. As the Religion-Classes are an appendage to ourChurch School Organization, and as such are underthe control of the respective Stake Boards of Educa-tion, and the Principal of the Stake Academy, whereaspracticable, should act as Stake Superintendent overthese classes, but the majority of our Religion-Class-Instructors are not professional teachers, all our 
 continuedWoodruff would kindly permit the B. Y. Academy to use Bro. Mae-ser's name for next year as Principal, and that Pres. Smoot be re-quested to secure the services of Bro. Geo. Brimhall, Principal ofthe Provo District Schools, as teacher for the Normal Department.With these arrangements being granted, they were willing to laboron at any sacrifice for the sake of bridging over the trying positioninto which their dear Academy were just now placed.  They all havereceived their training, spiritual and mental, in the Academy,and owed this debt of gratitude to her.  There was much emotionexhibited in that meeting.Last night I had a private interview with Pres. Smoot at hisresidence, by appointment.  By representing to him the fact that theB. Y. Academy had passed through many and severe struggles,among which the ordeal of fire was not the least, and had beengaining in spite of all that in influence and usefulness, andhad manifestly enjoyed the approval of the Lord and HisServants, she would continue to hold her own as long her Boardand Faculty would keep in the line of the Spirit of the Gospel.I told Bro. Smoot that the First Presidency were loyal to theB. Y. Academy, and that, in establishing a much needed Univer-sity at Salt Lake, for the purpose of eventually stopping thatpernicious annual exodus of our young people to  Eastern 
 regular Church-School-Teachers should render us allpossible assistance in the further development ofthat great work.3. It is very desirable that a report of the complete or-ganization of these Religion Classes should be receivedfrom every stake of Zion on or before Sept. 15.4. Many of our "District-Conventions" have passedthrough the experimental stage, and are in goodworking order. Several Branch Conventions havebeen organized for the greater convenience offar off members, and promise to become soonindependent District-Conventions. As the officeof Chairman of Convention has been found todevelop into one of great responsibility, it is thoughtbest that the General Board should reserve ^to itself^ thenominations for that office.5. Attention is called on it more to the instructions givenin our General Circulars that no branches of studiesshould be announced in Church School Annuals,was placed into the Curriculum, for which thereis not ^properly^ licensed or certificated teacher in thatschool. This rule applies also to Normal Classes inStake Academies.6. The unprecedented development of our Church SchoolsOrganization recalls to mind the ia discussion in theGeneral Board of Education preceding the issuanceof one of the General Circulars, when it was understood 
 High Schools, it was not intended to interfere in the least with the noble mission which the B. Y. Academy was performing. TheFirst Presidency had called away, it is true, thus far the leadingteachers from the Academy, but simply for the reason that therehad been no others available at the time, and not for thereason of keeping down the Academy. Bro. Smoot feels somewhat more encouraged, and instructed me to see Bro. Brimhall forthe purpose above alluded to.In connection with this B. Y. Academy affair, I beg leave to callyour attention also to the B. Y. College at Logan. Bro. JM. Tanner has an-nounced his intention to go East after the close of the schoolyear,and study also for a year or two as Bros. Talmage and Cluff havedone in order "to be even with them". Now, there is the AgriculturalCollege at Logan with its financial advantages gaining influenceand power in ever increasing ratio. The B. Y. College  must notbe suffered to be swamped by that Gentile Institution, which itcertainly would be, if Bro. Tanner, who has been working upa fine spirit among the young people there, leaves and no suitableman to continue the work. Suitable is only one that comes withan already established reputation. There are hundreds of youngmean in Israel that will be in a short time just as good andprobably better than any ofthe present known Educatorsamong the Latterday Saints, but they have to make theirreputation first. I have no one to suggest as suitable to carryon the work, if Bro. Tanner should leave this year. If youcould induce Bro. Tanner to stay one more year the difficulty 
 continuedby the members present that it would take about fiveyears before our contemplated standard of efficiencycould be reached. Two of these five years have nowpassed, and although much has been accomplished,a by far greater work is yet bifore us to attend to. Amongthe many problems awaiting solution is the one thatrequires all desirous of occupying the high responsibilityof Principal of a Stake Academy to hold the "AcademicDegree." It is to be hoped that this point can be reachedwithin the remaining three years.7. The permanency of the position of Principal is anotherpoint of vital importance, the attainment of which noBoard of Education can afford to lose sight of.Not only is the annual change in the Principalshipdeterimental to the best interests of the school in thespecial instances, but ^also^ has a tendency of lowering thestartndard of the whole profession, in not giving securityto talented persons for permanent homes and for thecreation of personal influences for golasting good in anygiven locality.8. Fully realizing the financial difficulties the mostof our Boards of Education have to contend with, 
 continuedmay ^be^ successfully met.A very similar case presents itself at the Millard Stake Acad-emy, Fillmore. President I. N. Hinckley has obtained from GovernorThomas the use of the "State House" at Fillmore, and is now engaged withhis Brothern to secure the building for a long term of years by awell fortified Lease. This move will require some extra financial ex-ertion on the part of the Saints in that Stake, but just at this junc-ture, Bro. Josiah Hickman, the Principal of the Stake Academy, intendsto resign for the purpose of taking a higher course at the L.D.S. College.I bound myself by my word to him last year, not to raise any objec-tion to his leaving this year, if he would hold on another year, asI had no suitable successor then, Bro. Hickman having done asplendid work down there and became the idol as it were of hisBoard, Students, and the People. That makes it very difficult for anyone to follow after such a man, for everything he does or say willbe measured by the standard of his predecessor. Pres. Hinckleyrequested me to use my influence with Bro. Hickman to remain an-other year until the S. Academy should be fairly started in thenew building. As my word had been given to the contrary,I could not do so, but Bro. Hickman will abide by your counselin the matter. He will call on you on the subject.There is a great deal of diffidence on the part of [several] 
 the General Board, nevertheless, can not urge earnestlyenough the necessity of having the services of every Prin-cipal at least secured for the whole schoolyear, thatis 40 weeks. For, if this cannot be done, we willbe beaten in the long run. The District School Servicesis only too anxious to secure our best teachers by offersof pecuniary remuneration exceeding ours by far,and asking for less efficiency. We would onlyeducate teachers practically for two or three years,in order to turn them over as experienced teachers intothe District School Service. Teachers cannot be askedto labor always on missionary rates, or fill outthe balances of the year with other occupations tomake both ends meet.9. It is very desireable that the Stake Presidents should bepresiding over the Stake Boards of Educations wheneverpracticable, and that noone ^member^ should continue hismembership in such a Board that is not willing toput forth his energies for the advancement ofthe respective school.10. It has come to the notice of the General Boardthat the interests of our educational movementare greatly interfered with in some Stakes bylocal jealousies. Wherever this spirit has shown itselfit has proven itself antagonistic to the true interestin Zion.11. There is no Stake Board of Education in Cache Stakeof Zion. The Board of Trustees of the B. Y. College at 
 Stake Presidents in regard to the introduction of these "ReligionClasses", and one, President Smith of Davis Stake, told me atFarmington during the meeting, Sunday afternoon, that they didnot need these classes in Davis Stake.Questions have been asked me from many sides, ifthese Instructors in the Religion Classes, should not beset apart for their mission by their Bishopric? AlthoughI am of the opinion that they should be, I had no authorityto give such instruction. If this should be your mind, pleaseto instruct me accordingly, that I could put it into the next"Church School Papers."With kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser 
 continuedLogan is composed in its majority of Brethren not be-longing to the Stake, I understand. As the Religion-Classesare under the direction of a "Stake Board of Education"some provision should be made in this regard.12. As the Principals of the Stake Academies at BrighamCity, ^and^ Ephraim, and also hold no Academic Diplomas as yet,but these Academics have appropriations for JuniorNormal Classes, in what moment can these Principalsbe authorized to teach those classes? This pointneeds some adjustment in order to bring it inharmony with our general instructions.13. Bros. Moench in Ogden, and Hickman in Fillmore have also carried on for several yearsquite successfully some normal instructions, andraised a number of good district-school-teachers.It would prove almost disastrous to these two insti-tutions to discontinue that work for the future.No provisions for the examination in a course inPedagogy have been made as yet, pending theinstructions on the subject by the General Board inthe revised edition of the General Circulars. Whatis to be done in these two cases for the time being 
 I should suggest an "Annual License" for allof these Principals, pending thesie examination forthe "Academic Degree" in "Pedagogy", next year.14. In compliance with the instructions of Gen Circ. No. 5.I reminded Bro. Moench in a letter of May 14, of thenecessity of completing his examination in Drawing,Music, & Logic in the Intermediate Grade which hehad not done last year, thus not getting a Percentagein "General Efficiency." I also suggested to him theadvisability of preparing himself for the "AcademicDegree," as it became necessary for such an importantplace as Ogden to have its Church Academy presided overby a regular "Professor" by and by. This I wrote in anofficial letter, of which the copy is on file. In consid-eration, however, of the long and faithful services ofBro. Moench, I wrote him also a private letter ofencouragement and explanation. All this Bro. Moenchhas answered by enclosed letter. I am in favor ofBro. Moench being granted his full papers for theIntermediate Grade without any further examinationby order of the General Board, in consideration of hislong and faithful services. But the "Academic Degree"he should obtain in the prescribed course of pro-ceedings. Please return his letter to me withyour instructions.15. From several directions have propositions beenmade by Church School Teachers to organize into aregular body for mutual support, to which endthey ask for the privilege of electing a Committee 
 Provo City, November 6, [189]0President Wilford Woodruff,Dear Brother,Since the opening of the present academic year, I have visited theChurchschools in Emery, Sanpete, Juab, Utah, and Salt Lake Stakes. In thefirst one of these, I found the Seminary at Huntington, James E. Brown,Principal, in a very satisfactory condition, there were already in the fourthweek of its organization 42 pupils, all of the IV and V Reader Grades inattendance. No Lady-Teacher as yet, but called for since then, and willarrive there, probably next week. Large attendance anticipated for thewinter season. Bro. Brown is a great favorite with the people & stake.Academy at Castle Dale, Bro. Eli A. Day, Principal, has only 16 stu-dents. Bro. Day was not sufficiently familiar with our system, but is afaithful and hardworking teacher. I parted him soon and madearrangements with him and Bro. Brown to meet often and harmo-nize their labors. Both schools in that Stake have separate housesto meet, Huntington ^Seminary^ being somewhat more conveniently fixedthan the Stake Academy at Castle Dale. Both Boards are current-ly working for the good of their respective schools.In Sanpete I had the pleasure in visiting at the inauguration of the Seminary at Manti, Andrew C. Nelson, Principal,of the Seminary at Gunnisan, Joseph Y. Jensen, Principal, [2]Manti Seminary  opened with 76 students and miss [Hon]
