 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day Saints.P.O. Box B.Salt Lake City, Utah, March 23rd, 1896.ELDERS JAMES E. STEELE,ROBERT L. BYBEE,JOS. S. MULLINER,Presidency of the Bingham Stake.Dear Brethren:Your letter of the 13th inst., addressed to PresidentGeorge Q. Cannon, contains an enquiry concerning the correct languageto be used in ordaining a man to the office of an Elder. You say somelittle difference of opinion exists among the brethren of your Stake onthis point.We do not like to write out a form of ordination for theoffice of an Elder. But it is a very simple ceremony, as are all theceremonies connected with the ordinances. This is beautifully illustra-ted in the form which the Lord gives, on page 609 of the Book of Mormon,concerning the ordination of Priests and Teachers.There are some people who seem to attach great importanceto phraseology, and are very technical, and think things are not doneright unless every word is spoken just as it should be. This is notright. A spirit of that kind leads to disputations as to forms; and wefind considerable of that arising from time to time in theological clas-ses and among others. That which is necessary in ordaining a man isto ordain him to the office in the Aaronic Priesthood or the MelchisedekPriesthood (whichever it may be) by the authority of tyhe Holy Priesthood 
 and in the name of Jesus. This, in a few words, is all that we thinknecessary to be said upon the subject.With kindest regards,Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F. Smith 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said we all stood in need of Faith, especially at the present time, we have ^had^ good peace for a great many years, and he had no doubtbut every one would sooner or later be tried to the very core. We should be prepared for every thing that may come along. We are the friends of God, and the world is it war with us, and he was glad of it. God has put into ourhands the Gospel of Christ, the Kingdom of God, and that makes the world mad, as for Polygamy they did not care so much for it, as for the dust under their feet.If it requires the United States to shed moreblood of the saints, before their cup is full, they will shed it, there never was a more corrupt nation dwell on the face of the earth, than that which now exists on this covenant.And the saints should never in their prayers 
 forget to pray for Colfax, and the Government in the right way. We have everything to encourage us in doing right -- to keep the word of Wisdom, and whatever is required of usNo man ever apostatizes from this church without transgressing the laws of God, either secretly or openly -- the Spirit of God will never leave any one without sufficient cause.Prest Young is not without Revelation, he is not without the power and Spirit of God, he has councilled the saints for a great many years, by the mind and will of God, and if everything had to be done by Revelation, many of us would now be living under great condemnation. 
 Elder W. Woodruff in his acquaintance with Joseph Smith & Brigham Young, said he never kneweither to give any council but what always came out true, instancing the Sidney Rigdonwhom Joseph wished to through [throw] off &cWe have got to follow the Lord—the Celestial law must be abided or we never can be exhalted.Prest. Young is our Lawgiver and standsbetween us and God, and if God has any revelation to give to man, he willnot give it to him ^me^, nor Billy Godbe, but it will come through Prest. Young—he will speak through his mouthpieceGod has placed him as our leader in temporal as well as in other things—weshall be dictated by revelation and counciland those who abide it and will be saved. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff. Moved and was secondedThat this meeting be turned into a caucusmeeting, for the purpose of making nominating our City Officers, preparatory to the forthcoming Election. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we were approaching a very interesting time, and as the Lordwill have a tried people—we shall ^have^ a severe test to prove and try the saints—something that make us look around us, and ascertain where we shal stand—the nation on this continent is nearly ripe in iniquity, and willcertainly be destroyed, according to the revelations given to Joseph—Men that are not groundin their faith by revelation, must past away in the trying hour—every weapon that is formed against us, will not prosper—Let the Elders read the revelations and become acquainted with them—that we may seewhat is coming—The Lord does not require us to make war upon our enemiesuntil he reveals it from heaven—He could afford to lay down his temporallife, rather than forfeit his eternal salvation—If it was necessary let Prest Young and others be hid up in these mountains—but he did not think the Lord was going to destroy the faithful saints of God—but let every faithfulMan of God be willing to assume his share of responsibility, instead of throwing everything on the 
 Elder W. Woodruff said, this being a school of ^the^ prophets,should be profitable to those who come here, the spirit of God that each Elder possesses is the spirit of prophesy--we have had the living oracles in our midst for 40 years on the 6th April next--And as a people we have got to prepare a place for the coming of the Son of Man--the United States had been warned ^lately^ by several hundredmissionaries, perhaps for the last time, and their testimonies will stand good before God, Angels and Men--the situation of the people required the Servants of God to interfere with temporalthings, and council and instruct them in the principle of cooperation &c, this gives offence to some,but all things are necessary from time to time --he then urged the necessity of each one who comes to this school, observing the rules which we have covenanted to observe -- We want an increase of faith, so as to meet all the opposition and persecution we may have to encounter.He then commended the Calmness and composure of our leader Prest Young, under the most trying 
 shoulders of Prest Young—There was a very wicked spirit in this City, which was connected with the same lying spirit at Washington.When Colfax was here, he had the pleasure of preach-ing the Gospel to him and warn him against sheddinginnocent blood—let us stand valiently and bear our testimony, and leave the event in the hands of God let us go before the Lord, and pray that Hypocrites and liars may be gathered out. 
 circumstances, encouraged the school to put their trust in God, and be united, and do our duty,And our Leaders will be inspired to lead this peoplein a straight path and Zion will be built up --and the Go blessings of God will rest upon his people, and may thHe enable each one to do their is my prayer in the name of Jesus -- 
 Elder W. Woodruff, loved to see men valient in a good cause, especially in the testimony of Jesus—He had known Elder Taylor as far backas Kirtland, stand up nobly in defending the prophet Joseph—The spirit made manifest here to day, he had no doubt existed amongall the Elders of Israel.This was the great Kingdom of our God, and our Government will not rot and come to 
 Elder W. Woodruff . said a Man must live his religion if he expects to be benefited by it.He was satisfied that a faithfull man of God willhave his rewardOne fault among latter day saints was a looseness in paying his obligations. We should improve in this No one apostatizes from this church in a day, it generally commences in a neglect of dutyMany both in and out of the Church find faultwith Prest Young, and say that he tyranizes over the people, but he has known him fir many years, both in public and private, and no one, whom he ever knewhad so few failings as Brigham Young, butHe had been a great benefactor to the poor, whom he had brought from their poverty in the old country and placed them in comfortable circumstances in these vallies. We as a people must keep the commandments of God if we expect to be saints - we must try to overcome our taste for Tea, Coffee,Tobacco, Whiskey &c it was a warfare, and will be, as long as we live, but the truth that leads to eternal life is a narrow one. 
 nought, hav being about to fill up the measure of their iniquity—we do not know what the Lord wants to do with us, but we must take it patiently, and whatever the Lord says through his servant Brigham, we will do.He had been baptized for all his friends, and was ready to go behind the vail any time the Lord wanted him—but Zion will prosper and be built up, every latter day Saint should live to build it as far as they have strength and ability. He then prophesied the speedy destruction of this Nation, and the establishment if the Kingdom of God— 
 our future condition and exaltation, certainly depends on the course we pursue here.We are the best people on the earth, and he had no doubt but we were trying to improve our lives.He did not believe, the wicked will ever disturb us from our homes — if we will only do right, and prize our priveleges.He knew this was the Gospel, and these are the people of God, and we have the ordinancesbut if Zion needs cleansing, God will cleanse her. He prayed that God would prepare us for whatever is coming — to be true and faithful & c 
 On Saturday May 14th 1870Theological Class met at the Tabernacleat One o clock pmPresent Prest Geo. A. Smith presidingAfter singing Prayer by Elder S. W. Richards SingingElder A P. Rockwood recommended a systematic organized effort being made to destroy the Grasshoppersunless it is done, he was satisfied there will be but little raised this season.Elder W. W. Woodruff  said the best plan he had found to destroy them was to get a large sheet, and a man at each corner to drag it through the grain, and when caught & bury them—it certainly was their duty to make an organized effort, and if after that is done, and the Crops are destroyed, we shall have the satisfaction of having done our duty. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff reported that a considerable effort had been made during the week by BroTurnbow and those who had turned out to assist him, in the destruction of the Grasshoppers, and hoped that a union of Gra exertion will be continue to be made that our wheat may be spared 
 Elder W. Woodruff had a pleasant journey up north—the leading Council given, was ^for^ the Saints to lay up their grain—had they heeded it before, the Grasshoppers would not have visited usWoollen and other Factorys were also recommended for the saints to buildZion is increasing—We shall soon have a Mighty host in these vallies—Parents should teach their children the Gospel of ChristHe hoped the Saints would magnify their callings and build up the Kingdom of GodHe would like to have them build one Templein these vallies—hundreds had got to be built.If we did our duty, we shall never be driven away from these valliesWhen the time comes, for the Saints to go back to build up Zion in Jackson County—that these vallies will not be vacated entirely, neither will all return to that Country. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff refered to the manypriveleges that latter day Saints enjoy, wasglad many were waking up to the subjectof Baptism for the dead—He had beenbaptized and sealed to all his progenitorsthat he could find out—He then madecomparisons between the beautify and gloryof our religion, and the nonsense ofwhat the world called  religion—When we pray, we pray to a being who hasa Head, a Heart, and a perfect organization—people apostatize, because they dont keep thecommandments of God, they dont study thescriptures,— what is not yet revealed will be, a little at a while until we shallreceive all ^that^ is essential for our perfection &c 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff  said we are all here by FaithUtah would never have been inhabited without faithJoseph Smith brought forth the book of Mormonthrough faith—He himself, had been sustainedAnd done what he had done since he embracedthe Gospel, by Faith—He was one who wentup in Missouri to fight the state, to redeem Zionby Faith 
 All our works had been performed by faithHe had faith that our enemies would be stirredup to fight against us—but Salvation, such thatis promised unto us should stimulate us to exercisefaith and our works should correspond to do whatGod required of us—Some had not faithenough to retain their standing in the church, they hadgradually given way to temptation and given wayto overt acts until the Spirit of the Lord was entirelywithdrawn from them.God was going to build up Zion in spite of Earthor Hell—A man who has received the HolyGhost had the Apostleship &c and then fallaway, had far better have had a Millstone coput around his neck and cast into the seaHe did not want to live one hour onlywhile he continued in the faithLet our wants be known before the Lord, and prayfor our friends and enemies also.We will ^have^ plenty of new principles as fast as wecan appreciate and live up to them 
 Elder W. Woodruff commented severely on the wilful practise of Herd boys destroying fences, and damaging the late crops,And shewed the necessity of enter^ing^ into all our operations, the principle of cooperation.^The importation of Bees and Fish^ 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said, he alone was responsible for what was said about Bp Gardners ward party, he was not present himself, but from reports that reached him, he had stated last saturday what he did, was pleased with Bp Gardners statement, realized the difficulties that B'ps labour under, especially in the management of parties, where licquor happens to get in, if only by a few He hoped Bp Gardner would be blest in controuling his ward he entertained a high regard for him 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we had been in school a good while, and ^he^ believed we were approaching avery great and important crisis as a people he also believed, we were improving and ad-vancing. The Angel told Joseph what wouldbecome of cerain nations, quoted many passages of ancient scriptures, and taught him their application, by this means he was t instructed and taught from a pure and correct fountain.the spirit of revelation grew up in him until he became throughly acquainted with it.The same spirit dwelt in Bro Brigham and ^had^ been growing in him for many yearswe want to learn God and the spirit of Godas well as the sciences, for there are many great philosophers well versed in the sciences are not only ignorant of God, but are infidelin their principles. Let any one read the Pro-phecies in Isaih, Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants with a prayerful spirit, and we can almost write the future of many nations.He spoke of the diversity of gifts and qualifications, some quick to discern one thing, and some another. There was a necessity for each one to learn the voice of the Spirit, mentioning two cases ^of^ self preservation in is own experience by listening to and obeying the whisperings of the spirit. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said in behalf of the parent association, for the introduction of Improved Stock, Bees, Swine, Sheep &c &c, while they were calling ^upon^ other counties to cooperativee with them in establishing branch associations—it was very necessary for us in Salt Lake County to start in a cooperative effort to herd our stock so as to have the ranch cleared of all that is now running loose—have a regular system on an upright principle that every one may have their rights—there as been a great amount of dishonesty practised by individuals who have undertaken to take stock & sheep on shares, and we want to do away with this. 
 (3) Jan 14, 18701W. Woodruff. continued adverted to the hand of God in our present peace and quiet we enjoy in this City, notwithstanding the hue and cry of our bitter enemies, in the set time of the almighty Not only this Nation, but other Nations that lift their hands against this work will be broken to pieces and come to nought. Prayed that we might all become more acquainted with the spirit of God, understand his purposes, and be prepared for the great things that are coming to pass. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said these important subjects, require our wisdom, patience and perseverance—He spoke of Father Russell ship builder, who before embracing the Gospelhad his Life & Ships Insured, but after that, drew his interest out, and paid his Insurance money into the church, and trusted in God to take care of his life and property.He also explained some particulars about starting the Co operative HerdSpoke of the opposition we have had to contend with from the Government Officials who have tried to bring us into bondage & trouble—but have signally failed, God has heard the prayers of the faithful and delivered us out of the hands of the wicked—he feels that God will continue to break every weapon that is formed against us—our enemies are very short lived, God has cut them off—and will do so, & build up Zion.let us therefore combine and cooperate together and have integrity and shew that are in every worthy of the confidence of both God and man 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we ought to rejoice in the privelege of living in a day when we can assist in building a Temple to the name of the most highno one since the days of Solomon has had such a privelege—many efforts have been made to destroy us in this generation, but the hand of God has been outstretched towards us and delivered us from the hands of our enemies 
 We are abundantly able to do what is required of us if we are only willing.He felt anxious to respond to the call made last Saturday for funds to emigrate the poorbut having no ready means on hand was the only cause he did not.He would give 1,000 lbs Flour to help feed the hands that work on the TempleIt was quite a privelege to help build up the Kingdom of God—We cannot take behind the vail any of our property with us, but we can take with us, those blessings that have been put on our heads by the servants of God, if we will only live for them. 
 Elder W. Woodruff, spoke on the same subject ^of sustaining home manufactory;^Shall we sustain our own machinery and manufactories, or shall we neglect itwe ought to study the interests of Zion, if we dont study its interests, we had better g leave and go to California—we had better Cooperate in everything that will build up Zion—we  have the power to build a Temple and occupy it—a privelege which the ancient apostles never had—We are building a Zion here, though Earth & Hell are opposing us—whatever council is given us, let us carry it out. 
 Elder W. Woodruff warned the school against telling out of this house what is spoken here, but keep sacred the covenantswe have made 
 Elder W. Woodruff, said the secret of the present antagonism about Polygamy, was simply, because it was a command of God, and Lucifer was opposed to it. He did not believe in abandoning one principle of the Gospel to please this Nation or any other. We can afford to risk the issue and consequences of the present persecution—the controversary is between God and the Nation.Let us remember to keep the commandmentsof God, to attend to our prayers and duties and God will deliver us—We shall certainly come off much better, by cleaving to our religion than by bartering any portion of it away for the sake of a state government—Let us unite our prayerstogether. 
 Elder W. Woodruff strongly recommended the Elders of Israel to keep a Journal of the dealings of God with them—the Prophet Joseph used to urge this upon the Elders—k Bro Woodruff said heco Kept a record of every sermon that he heard Joseph preach—He wished that a more correct account had been Kept of the early doings of the early Elders of the church, and the dealings of God with his people—he has never neglected one day without writing something in his diaryIn regard to the spirit of Prophecy, we are apt to look two high, and except too much in the wrong direction—the still small voice of the spirit was what we should seek after and cultivate—the church in its infancy When a man was called to go on a mission, the Lord 
 had to be enquired of, and obtain from Him a revelationbut now Prest. Young living in the light of revelationhundreds are called to go on a mission and have to start in a few hours—the Church has grown, andwe are continually led by the spirit of revelation—We have much to be grateful for, the Kingdom is onward and upward—He then related several forewarnings of danger ^by the spirit of God^ which he always listened to and acted upon, and himself, family & friends saved from sudden destruction 
 Elder W. Woodruff spoke of ^the^ immutability of the wordof God—he could see the s hand of God as he leads and guides the destinys of this people.a dark cloud had been over us, for some months past—and yet, the spirit of calmness & composurehas rested upon his Servants—let us do right, have faith in God, and nothing can checque this onward course of this church—during the past 40 yearsthe Lord has been giving us an experience, and pre-paring us to accomplish his purposes.all that fight against Zion will certainly ^be^ put to shame and confusion, as past experience proves.If its the will of the Lord to give us a State Government, we shall certainly have less to do with the Government, than we have now in a Territorial capacity, then, we can elect our own Governor, Judges &c whereas now, those officers are forced upon us without our consent. 
 Elder W. Woodruff hoped to live long enough to see pleasant Ephraim enjoy all the blessings,that were long since, enjoyed by their forefathers  he then spoke of the Elders of Israel who held the destinies of the Nations in their hands, and the necessity of them living worthy of their high and holy calling. He then related a dream that he had while on a Mission to in England  pertaining to the Lamanites. he saw a beautiful Temple rerected on the mountains of Israel, he went in, and while there, a large number of Laman-ites came in and seated themselves in a placeby themselves, by and bye, they began to work,and they seemed to accomplish more in two hours than others could do in a day, but a strict account was kept of ^all^ the labour that was performed by every one in that house. and they appeared to have been inspired by some prophet to enter that Temple, and enter upon those blessings promised by their forefathers. 
 the acts of the wicked will fall upon their own head, and the righteous will be delivered—it is our privelege to ask the Lord for a State Government, and if its his will, he will grant it, by raising up friends to urge our petition through both Houses of Congress—do not forget our prayers, nor fail in any of our duties and God will establish Zion in these Mountains. 
 Elder W. Woodruff spoke with gratitude to God, for the prospect of a bountiful Harvest. He wa had also commenced to favour Zion, to build it up, gather the poor, would bless the leaders of Iassrael with the light of revelationand,  &c 
 We are a branch of Ephraim, and received the Gospel first. and should treat the poor degraded Indian with Kindness, for they fellthrough unbelief, we should also be anxious to build this Temple here, and that in St George.He then spoke of the persecution that was pressing upon us by the heads of this nation, by unlawfully keeping in bondage, our Brethren. as Latter day Saints, we should seek the blessing of God of upon the saints, and his displeasure upon his enemies. The Leaders of this people have stood the test, and been proved for many years hence, we should hold up their hands, and exercise faith for them, these honours and labours that God has put upon our brethren, should stimulate us follow in their footsteps. a faithfulhumble follower of Jesus Christ, is in a far more exalted position, than can be confer'd upon men by the world. Let us be faithful to God and each other, and endure to the end, that we may be saved for Jesus sake. Amen.

 Great Salt Lake City Oct. 16, 1849Elder Wilford WoodruffBeloved BrotherWe received lengthy communications, scraps and Papers from you,by the last mail, which we have scarce had time to read, in full; businesshas pressed so heavily upon us, but we understand your situation, and willmake all the communication at this time, that the nature of the case will admit.Our mail is closed, and about ready to start. OurGeneral Epistle is in Type, by which you will learn General news, and weshall send this, and many more communications by Express, to overtake themail in the mountains. Your friends are well, and the People generally,and we would all be glad to see you here with your family.Gather up all the Saints in the East, this Winter, andmake ready, and in the Spring come with them, and you will see greatimprovements have taken place since you left home. Tell the brethren ofCapital to bring means to establish factories.Say to the brothers Livingston, at Peterboro, that nextyear there will be wool enough raised in the Valley, to supply aconsiderable factory, that the cloth is needed here, that here is the placefor building Zion, that here is a better place to manufacture and makemoney than any other place: and persuade one or all, and all suchto remove with delay to this place. Next Season we design asettlement over the rim of the Basin on the South, where cotton,rice and sugar cane will flourish, and from whence we can getour supplies: but even at present, it would be far better to transportthe raw cotton from the States and have it manufactured here,than to bring the cloth, for there are good water privileges in abundance,and experienced workmen on hand. therefore start out a companyboth for cotton and woollen manufacturing, this Winter ready forspring's emigration with machinery, &c, and every facility will begranted them in this place, which possible can be. 
 Also we want some Iron founders. There is coal and Ironnot far distant in good locations, and moulders in the Valley, thereforedo not fail to bring us a founder, for castings of all descriptions aremuch needed, and there is no location in the States so good as thisfor the business.There is no class of mechanics or manufactures but can do well here, for we are in the centre of Creation, and in need of manythings except Gold, but should we tell you all we have seen andhandled you could scarce believe.In the short space of about onemonth we have received by voluntary donation over 5,500 dollarsfor a perpetual emigrating fund, and sent Bishop Hunter, to the States to gather up the Poor. Further particulars you will glean from ourEpistle, and our letters to brother Hyde, a copy of which you willdoubtless see. You are an agent to solicit and receive donations forsaid fund: any means you can gather and forward to Bishop Hunterat Kanesville early in the Spring will be immediately applied, toits destined object.Find brother Benjamin S. Wilber of New York and bring him on with all his goods. We also want brother Jesse C. Little to settleup his affairs and come to this place. This is the place for business,for increasing and doing good.Come with the Saints, Master Workmen, machinery, with yourGold, (not Silver 'tis too heavy) and all precious things, and when you arrive,we shall have so much to tell you what we cannot write, youwill be ready to declare "a half has not been told me," Yes Bro Woodruffstretch out your arms like a man of God, and gather up and bringa host to Zion.With our best wishes and blessings on yourself and family andall the faithful. We remain your brethren in Christ.Brigham YoungHeber C. KimballWillard Richards 
 P.S. Agreeably to your last letter, brother Richards expects you haveaccomplished your mission with brother Russel, and that the transferhas been completed long before this.WR

 a speaker are as remote as they were at the commencementof the session. Yesterday Mr Mead of Va called MrDuer of N. Y. a liar which was followed by a scenethat may be more easily imagined than described.The report this morning is that Mead will challenge Duerto mortal combat, and in the event of his declining,which Madam Vernons says he will, then he (Mead)will attack him in the street or wherever he may meethim—This will be an exciting and stormy session,and if there be not some duels fought I shall bedisappointed—The Lord has indeed and in truthcome out of his hiding place to vex this nation—I avail myself of the accosion to tender to sister Woodruffmy kind regards, and to renew to you ^assurances of^ my highrespect and esteem—John M. BernhiselP. S. I have presented a specimen of salt from the GreatSalt Lake and a copy of the Book of Mormon to theLibrary of Congress, which were gladly receeived,and the Salt was placed along side of some whichwas brought by Leut. Lynch from the Dead Sea or Salt Sea, and said to be part of Lot's wife—I avail myselfof every proper accasion to preach the Gospel to members of Congress and other distinguished per-sonages—Brother Babbitt and I get along pretty well.In haste &cJ.

 [sideways text] Elder Orson SpencerJany. 18 1848 [end of sideways text]Liverpool Jan. 18, 1848Dear Pres. Wilford WoodruffHaving learnt by a Letterreceived yesterday from Pres. Brigham Young dated Nov.25th that you with the greater part of your Quorum hadreturned to Winter Quarters, I resolved to Seize, (nota favorable moment for writing to you,) but rathera forced capture of some fleeting moments to fulfillmy promise & delight in the matter. It cheers my heartto learn that you have become sound enough tomake a visit of two thousand miles over the mountainsin one season in company with so many of yourbeloved Quorum. All in health & increased strengthI say to glory to God for this glorious & successful butarduous expedition of the Latter Day Liberators!This expedition will constitute a new epoch in theannals of the everlasting kingdom, that will beconspicuous for worlds to come for the energyenterprize & indefatigable endurance of the performanceThe results of this expedition are endlessly by praiseworthyand glorious. I shall now venture to tell the BritishSaints and the Nations of Europe that Zion is establishedThat their eye may look upon her that is to be thejoy of the whole earth & and an eternal excellency."Beautiful for Situation is that place. The mountainsare round about the fat valley of the great basin 
 as a munition of Rocks. The splendid intelligence of the millennial Era is requisite in order to appreciatethe worth of the labors of the first founded of the kingdomof Latter day glory. I shall boldly declare that aresting place for the laboring & heavy laden of allNations is now prepared. I can now answer themoanful cry of the emigrant that has often beenreiterated in my ears in this land; "When maywe emigrate? I have long been out of businessand expending my means, when can I emigrate?Now I have the happiness through your toils andmemorable discovery & liberal permission to announcethe welcome day. I do not regret having come toEngland on this important mission, neither shallI regret an invitation to return when it comes fromyour dear & honored Quorum. The past year hasbeen one of great prosperity as to the enlargementof the Church in this Island & the increase of faith anddiligence & zeal in the work of the Lord. Many thousandshave been added to the Church & peace & unionhave pervaded all parts of the Kingdom of Christ on this Island. In Wales there has been addedto the Church about one hundred & fifty a monthfor five or six months past. In nearly all placesthe work moves forward with the most delightfulimpulse. All feel strong & ardent for the increaseof the Saved. What will be the effect of Emigrationupon the future impulse & progress of the work is 
 yet problematical. American Elders will become scarce after three more leave the Island. A few recruitswould not come amiss. Agreeable to my instructionsfrom counselcil I shall open the channels of emigrationwith all possible diligence. The Emigrants will almostunavoidably stop at different places. Some areanxious to go, if they can reach no further than St Louisor even New Orleans & I am glad that the Councilsaw fit to appoint an agent to look after them at theseplaces. I need not inform you that it will be verynecessary. I have increased the number of our Paperduring the year about 5 or six hundred. The presentnumbers now issued at the commencement of theTwo first no's of the tenth volume are about 32,000I have printed nearly 200,000 small Tracts or"Invitations" and more than 150,000 pages of largerTracts which are spread abroad among the peopleaiming thereby to warn & invite all the inhabitanitsof this Island as far as practicable. The Saints arealmost enthusiastic in preaching & warningthe people in every possible way. The new Editionof the Hymn Book is nearly all sold. A smallnew Edition of the Book of Mormon is also just printed.I have also just printed a Small volume mostlyof Letters in continuation of a reply to Rev. Wm CrowilBoston Mass. U. S. A. which received a ready demandI have purchased a Phonatic Font of 329 poundswright for the Council according to request, and shall 
 Send ^it^ by Bro Wheelock Soon; having no chance toSend it Sooner safely. I shall also purchase agood microscope to send at the same time. I haveaddressed three Letters to Pres. Young since I havebeen here, one of them was Superscribed to Pres.Young or Pres. Hyde. I have in the absence ofPres. Young (over the mountain) written to Eld.Orson Hyde on the business of the Church, supposinghim to be the proper authority to counsel me.I am fully ready to return home or to remain orgo elsewhere hopeing thereby to secure the confidenceof the "Twelve" whom I ever desire to obey in the Lordas it is meet. The friendly hint given me by Pres.Young when he appointed me to this mission and latelyrepeated & formerly seconded by Bro Pratt, viz notto walk in the steps of my defaulting predecessors in officealmost inclined me to look over my geography tosee in what part of the world it is that they poke onehorse because another horse is unruly. My heart is sometimes melted like wax to think of my desolate andnow sick little children & I could return to them withjoy if so counselled. But I am blessed so far with the faith & support of all Israel & hope ever to merit thesame by well doing. Crime & distress are awfulin this land and the evils increase rather than disminish.The power of the endowment is mightily visible in Europeif not in America. My playful allusion to the hint toPres. Young is, done with the utmost kindness & respectfor his motives & the wisdom of the hint. Remember mein the praying circle for I never felt my need of wisdommore. Give my love to your wife & Pres Young & I want to say morebut business hurries & my sheet is full.Orson Spencer

The most of the leavesremain on the appletrees yet. My health is not veyvery good this win-ter I fearl much of the effects of my summers work. The chil-dren all go to school but Bula, Willford has had very bad eyesfor 8 or 10 days so that he cannot read or study. Fathers health isuncommonly good this winter but I never knew him as fractiousas he is and has been lately. Last thursday sister's Pratt, Hyde,Taylor Kimball Benson Hooper & Smith made me a visit, (sisterYoung being quite sick she could not come,) the most of thembrought their letters and read them and we had a very pleasenttime. Sister Smith's letter was read first which gave the infor-mation of Br. Pratt's addition to himself. I think there was somejokes passed and prophecyes, delivered upon the occasion, however it was 
 nothing unexpected to her as she said they had decided upon itbefore he went away that is if he saw any one that would answerthe purpose that he wished, he then wrote her that he had foundone she said that he had been trying a number of months ^to find someone.^I soon sent to the office when I had time and received yourpackage and distributed them according to the directions I amglad to have you write to them ^the children^ as they have often told me thatyou cared nothing about them but to scold them, they were muchpleased with their letters I thought them very good and they allwant to write you Moroni not excepted he was much pleasedand wants the children to write you for him but Bula thinksshe can write write and dictate herself, so she has written some.Moroni does about as well as can be expected but he requires atight reign kept. I thought I would not say any thing aboutmy family cares to you to distrub your felicity but you askedme to tell you how the children Emma & Sarah got along. Ithink the children & Emma get along very well in schoolWillford has not been able to study much for sometime onaccount of his eyes I have got him a new pair of boots and paid$3.50 cts for them. E s^t^ays with me most of the time but the childrendo much better without her than with her as she waits for them &they for her so the work is principally left for me also she stirsthem up to make a noise and theirs is much jargon betweenher and Susan which frets father much she inclines tostay here all the time she makes me much more trouble than she

I am very glad to hear from you oftenI forgot to tell you that we get but one numberof the news—I thought perhaps you had one numbersent to you. We are all well. The measles are aboutand I am afraid that Bula will get them.We have sent a large package of letters to youby Br Haywood with which I think you will beamused and Phebe has just received one by mailin answer to one she wrote on the windowseat in the dusk I knew nothing she wrote, she says she will do better nexttime. The weather for 3 days past has been very cold but todayis mild. Br Haywood expected to have gone 2 day before thisbut he expects to start in the morn. I have just writenthis to say that we have received I think all your lettersSo good by my love good byPhebe W. WoodruffI think if you had as much confusion about youas I think you have it would be perplexing to you 
 does me good but she thinks she thinks she does well. If thechildren were alone I could say to them you must and youmust not but with her I must be very careful to not give offence—she was quite offended to think that you told Sarahthat her education and principles were establish she said sheshould tell you that it was a fine thing that one of the familywas established—baulderdash has showed itself a numberof times there by her but I have as yet kept my foot on it.Sarah has had a cold but has got over it and is as crossas is possible she has got a web in the loom of about 20 yds.she has been 2 weeks about it and I think if she keeps on shewill get it out by spring. Miss Bula is so turbulent thematI am obliged to take a stick to her sometimes, taking allthings here together I have all that I can get along withI think S. & E. will write you. I am thinking of takeingthe children to the ward party ^on christmas^ to please them but myself wouldmuch rather stay at home I suppose you will have fine timeswith you on Christmas & New years well I hope you willenjoy yourself while you can. I feel that the cares andtroubles of this life are many but time rolls rapidly andI am glad of it. Susan has teased a long time to let her askyou one question at last I gave her permission so she hasdictated all herself. 25th Br.

 Brother W. Woo^d^ruff.Sir, your Letter of the 9th of March, dire-cted to Bishop Partridge, Presidents Joseph Smith Jr, SidneyRigdon, ^and^ Hyram Smith, and the Saints in Zion, came safely tothem, some day's since. aAnd on account of the press of businessnow on their hands, ^and the request of J Smi◊th Jr,^ I have taken it upon me to answer it.You say, that you have heard of the deplorable state of things inKirtland; and it gave me much Joy to learn by your letter, thatyou viewed those things in their true light. Great has been theafflictions of the saints in that place, particularly our belovedBrotheren Joseph Smith Jr, and S. Rigdon.In the pastsummer; I Journeyed from this place in company with WmSmith, and D. W. Patten, to Kirtland, for the purpose ofmeeting in conference those with the 12 ^twelve^. On our arrival,we soon learned the difeculties that then existed than: thesehowever wase all appearantly settled, preveious by to my leavingKirtland: And ^W^ Parish, who has since become  so [3 illegible words] ^an unbeliever in the book^^of Mormon, reveiled religion, [illegible],^ affected to repent and become sattisfied, with Br. Josephand the Church. oOthers also did the same: But this settlementwas not of long duration. Soon after this, President HyramSmith and I, left Kirtland for the upper Missouri: andPresident Joseph Smith, President S. Rigdon, and ^Prest.^ WmSmith, soon followed us to Far West: and during theirabsence, it seemes that ^Wr^ Parish, J. F Bointon, LukeJohnson, Joseph Coe, and some others, [illegible] ^united^ togeather infor the [2 illegible words] ^repecting the procedings^ of the Church. President Smith andhis company returned on or about the 10th of December;soon after which this [2 illegible words] ^decenting^ band, openly, and publickly,renounced the Church of Christ of Latterday Saints, and claimed,themselves to be the old standard, called themslves the Churchof Christ, excluded that of saints, and set at naught BrJoseph and the whole Church, denounceing them as Heriticks 
 How blind and infatuated are the minds of men, when once turned fromRigteousness to wickedness? They did not understand, that by takingupon them the name of Latter day Saints, did not do away that of theChurch of Christ. Neither did they consider, that the ancient church,was the Church of Christ, and that they were Saints. And again,it appears that they did not consider the Prophesy, of Daniel, whichsaith; ^says^ "The saints shall take the Kingom" &c "Again, "the Kingdom, andthe greatness of the Kingdom, under the whole Heaven, was given tothe people, (the Saints) of the most High" &c And the Saintshere alluded to, were certainly Latterday Saints; was much, as theabove prophesy is to be fulfilled, in the Last days; and is yetfuture, as all professed readers of the bible will confess.We have of late learned, that pParish, and the most [rest] of this [2 illegible words], ^combination^have openly renounced the Book of Mormon, and becme deists.I will now Leave Kirtland, and give you some acount of the move-ment of things here, as they are and have been.You, undoubtedly, will remember the visit, which I, in company withElder Groves, made to the Churches in Kentucky and Tennessee, inthe summer of 1836. You also may reecollect, the nature andresult, of our visit. We came to solisit assistance, for Poorbleeding Zion: And we obtained, through the goodnes of theChildren of God, in those regeons, the sum of fourteen hundredand fifty dollars, which we delivered unto Wm Phelps & JohnWhitmer, on our arrival to this place. But these men, insteadof laying out the money for the benefit of Poor bleedingZion, purchased Land for their own emolument. They g^e^nerallydid their business, independantly of the aid, or council of ^either^ the bishopor High Council. This gave some uneasiness to the 2 ^two^ author-ities of Zion: not only because they purchased land WithChurch funds, in their own name, for their own agrandisement,but because they selected the place of the City Far Westand appointed the spot for the House of the Lord to bebuilt on, drew the plan of said house, and appointed andordained a committee to build the same, withoutasking or seeking council at the hand of either Bishop,High Council, or first presidency; when it was well under-stood that these authorities wer ^appointed^ for the purpose of coun-ciling on all important matters pertaining to the saints ofGod.These two presidents also managed to get the town plottinto their own hands, that they that they might reap the availsariseing from the sale of the lots. In consequence of these, withmany other things, the Council met by themselves on the 3rd day ofApril 1837, and resolved to invite the two presidents, the Bishopand his council, and the two apostles, namely T. B. Marsh and D. W.Pattatten, to meet with them, on the 5th inst. to which time theyadjourned. Acordingly the above named authorities met, on the

 Jan" 29th 1840. At Alfred Cordon's, Club buildings, Navigation road, Burslem, Staffordshire, England.My Dear PhebeWhile seated in a foreign land I once more take up my pen to fill a sheet for your perusalMay grace, mercy, faith, peace, health, strength, & patience & resignation, rest upon you from GOD our Father & our LORDJESUS CHRIST. I have chosen a large sheet because I have much I wish to say unto you. I sent you a letterwhen I first arived in Liverpool but had not time to write but few words but merly designed you to know of my arivalBut knowing that you feel interested in my mission. I will coppy from my journal in this letter an account of myvoyage & travels since I left New York to the present time, & then make such other remarks as I may have room. Dec 18th, 1839in New York. I laboured hard all day to prepare for sailing. Three of us went on board (with our Baggage) of the Oxford a regularpacket ship of the New York & Liverpool line. viz Elders Taylor, Turley & myself, we slept on board. 19th The Oxford left the dock &moved out into the stream. 20th At 12 oclock she spread her canvass & set sail, was assisted a few miles by a steam Boat.She had on board 15 cabin & 64 steerage passengers & Capt John Rathbone, 1st Mate Yates, 2nd mate Jones, one carpenter & 26 sailors, making109 souls in all. Cabin fare $1.40 dollars steerage $15. Fair wind & sail well. 21st stift breeze & fair wind most allon board sea sick. 22nd Most are still sick Taylor, Turley, & myself some sick, a high wind through the day & a high gale atnight, Boat rocked & pitched Badly. 23rd Sea vary rough & winds high, some still sick 24th Sea mountains high & asrough as the Hills & valies of Kirtland. when we were in the trough of the sea, the waters would appear to be an hundred feetabove us in the air, the waters broke over the ship, & I got vary wet, & as their was no fire to go to except to cook by, I sat ondeck in the wind untill late in the evening to get dry, & though it was winter it was not vary cold. 25th A calm in the morning, the ship rocked bad upon the dead swells, wind soon rose & we sailed well 26th A rough sea & strong Breeze. 27th fairwinds, but some short squals. got over sea sickness, have a sharp appetite 28th Rough sea saw a large school of Blackfish & porposes. 29th pleasant morning & high breeze though the day. 30th A rough sea severe gale at night. it was with diffi-culty we could keep our births, while at the same time, Boxes, Barrels, & trunks were tumbling about the cabins. Thiswith the noise of the Officers, & sailors reefing & taking in sail, together with the sound of the roaring winds & rushing wavesmade much confusion. 31st Sea rough, sails under class reef, cloudy weather. This is the Last Day of 1839. Their isnot much to interest the mind while taking a voyage at sea. (excepting the roo^ll^ing [P]illows which are magestic) for oneis frecquently for many days without the sight of land or ever seeing a sail at sea, & must be crouded thicktogether in a cabin or stay upon dek in the spray, wind, or storm &c. JAN. 1st 1840. So time rolls alongrough sea, blustering, cloudy, & high winds 2nd The sun rose clear, it being the first time we have seen it for 5 dayswe have a calm, a sail is in sight, the first one we have seen since we left New York it is stern of us. 3rd Fair & good breezesail 12 miles an hour. We spoke a British Brigg from Halifax 20 days at sea bound for Liverpool in Long. 34.40. We past herwith great speed. 4th Fair weather & wind, stiff Breeze & fast sailing. They had a time of butchering hogs & sheep on board.5th rough sea, high winds, & rain. We saw a large school of porposes. A calm & pleasant evening which we spent on deckviewing the stars & Ocean. 6th A calm we have 12 sails spread. 7th A dead calm to day in Lon. 17.40 The passengers shot a numberof fowls which fell dead into the water. We spoke a Scottish Bark from Leith Scotland bound for Granada a west Indies Island 7 days atsea. We saw a large school of Black fish some of them were 20 feet in length. 8th a good wind. a lighted bar Barrel was sat afloatfrom the ship at night which appeared Brilliant at sea. Jan 9th cloudy & cold. smooth sea & fair breeze. We are about enter-ing the St George's channel. !!! Ho !!! Ho the cry of land land is herd from mast head. We went on to the forecastle & after straining oureyes for a few moments we got sight of it. It was the Irish Coast lying 3 points to our lee bow. this is the first land we have seen for 20days. At 8 oclock PM the revolving lamp at the lighthouse a cape clear came in full view. 10th The mountains of the Irishcoast, & also 6 or 7 sail is in ful view weather cloudy, & rather cold. We walked the deck untill 9 oclock viewing the lighthouses &c. 11th We had a heavy gale commenced at one oclok in the morning. We were in danger having the Irish coast on one side^the^ coast &^of^ wales on the other. their was a great bustle & noise on board from the captain, Mates, sailors, winds & waves &c. Wereached the pilote ground at daylight & raised colours for a pilot... a pilot Boat soon appea[r]ed & came along side & sent a piloton board of us, who arived in the midst of the gale. The pilot informed the captain that the steam ship Liverpool had notyet arived & she left New York 5 days befor[e] we did. & that the packet ship Independance had not reached Liverpool & she leftNew York 10 days before us. This intelligence created a great shout of rejoicings on board the ship, for it was the first timethat they had known a steam ship, beaten by a packet ship. but the intelligence was no sooner commun[ic]atedbefore the steam ship Liverpool [here] in sight behind us & was gaining upon us. The pilot ordered the sails to beunreefed notwithstanding it was blowing or gale & we were soon out of sight of the Liverpool again. We had notsailed but a short time with this speed before the town of Liverpool in England was in sight & an English steamBoat soon came & took us in tow & soon brought us along side of the quay in Liverpool upon which stoodthousands of human beings looking to see us land. the steam ship Liverpool came up just as we landed& fired two salutes of cannon at us as she past by. & Also the packet ship Independance came in in a fewminutes after. It was truly a singular circumstance that the Oxford, steam ship Liverpool, & Independance shouldall reach the quay at Liverpool within 20 minutes of each other, when one left N.Y. 5 days & the other 10 before the Oxfordbut so it was… Thus you see after 22 days sail we arived safe in Liverpool in good health & spirits & for the first timeI began to tread the soil in Old England. We took a walk into the streets of Liverpool. & visited some of the most Noted places of the Town, such as New Market, Custom House, Lord Nelsons Monument, &c. all of whichwere splendid. The Market contained a vast variety of evry kind of meats, fish, fowls, & vegitables that I ever sawThe Custom House was built of hewn stone in the form of an H and covered four acres of grouned. Lord Nelson'sMonument is all of Brass about 14 feet high & 3 rods around it their is 4 large personages as large as life with a chainaround their necks ^hands^ with one end of it in the mouth of a Lion, these are 4 Kings that Lord Nelson subdued in his day.Lord Nelson stands above those 4 Kings holding 4 crowns [FIGURES] in his hand, & death stands by his side partly coveredwith a shroud with one hand upon his Body. these are some of the prominent features of Lord Nelsons monument thoughthere are others of miner consequence. He was killed in batle while commanding his fleet, his monument is muchNoted in England. Their is not as much taste in general in pollishing, painting, & garnishing the out side of the buil--ldings in the cities & towns in England as in America, but they build more for duribility, their buildings arefar more expensive than in America, for they are composed of vast masses of huge stone or brick, though some of theirbuildings are far more spe^l^ended than those of America. Their is one thing vary disagreeable throughout England, the wholehemisphere or air is filled with smoke, smut, & gases, that rise from the dens population & burning of coal &c., the airis vary heavy & bad for the lungs, but the weather is not cold as in America, it is quite mild weather notwithstandingEngland is in 51 to 55 degrees North Lat I have not seen a flake of snow since I left New York is^t^ is 3,500 miles from  New York toLiverpool. Jan 12 Sunday I attended meeting at St Pauls Church, St Thomases Church which is the church of England I thought it varysingular to hear the Rector's, & Curit's preach against a form of Godliness without the power theirof & professing religion withouthaving the fruits of it. while perhaps their is no people more formal than themselves. In the evening I attended meeting atPitt street methodist chapel, the speaker appeared quite co[z]y & simple in his manners. All of the above named churches were 
 quite splendid with the pulpit or stand in or near the centre of the house which is the english custom. Another thinghas attracted my attention while visiting public places in England ie a great plainness of dress with both rich & poormale & female, their cloth may be equ⬦ally as good if not better than that worn in America but they do not appearas tasty & flashy. I think the Americans pattern more after the French than English in their dress. The Encllish deposittheir dead in vaults in the church yard & them lay the grave stons flat upon the ground over their dead which forms apavement to walk upon so you walk over the ded as you go in & out of church. Jan 13th Monday our trunks had to betaken from the ship & go to the custom Hou⬦se & by examined by the Officer. & after much jaming, crouding and rocking about, we were permitted to depart with our trunks & baggage after paying 16 ^pence^ sterling on evry pound of Books &papers that were American that we had with us. We then took the rail road at Liverpool for preston. & for the first mile the cars  run under ground on a track that was cut out of a solid Rock, while buildings & inhabitants were over our heads. The carsrun rapid in England. we arived in Preston, Lancashire, England. at 8 oclok P.M on this 13th day of Jan 1840 in the midst of the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints & I soon had Elder W. Richards by the hand & it was truly a happy meeting. I felt to rejoice to oncemore behold this Brother face to face & all the Saints who flocked around us with great rejoicings, after spending most of the night in conversation I retired to rest. 14th Preston contains a population of 60,000 the streets are crouded with the poor going to & from thethe factories wearing wooden or clog shoes which makes a great ratling over the pavement. The poor here in England I shouldthink were under as great Bondage as the children of Egypt Israel in Egypt. We held a council at Elder Richards house inPreston on Jan 17th & the following was one of the Resolutions post. Resolved that Elder's John Tailor & Joseph Fielding go to Liverpool &Elders Hiram Clark & Wm Clayton labour in Manchester & Elder Willi^a^rd Richards tarry in Preston & its neighbourhood & WillfordWoodruff & Theadore Turley go to the Potteries & warn the People in that place & then inquire the mind of the Lord & if it is his will goto Birmingham. The potteries contain a population of 65,000 persons & Birmingham 300,000 & the place is larger than New york& is in the centre of England 18th I took the parting hand with the Saints in Preston & in company with Elders Turley andClark took the rail car & rode to Manchester 36 miles whare we were soon greeted by Elder William Clayton & many Saints.Manchester is a vary beatiful Town containing a Pop of 280,000 souls & is as large as New york on the ground. It already has aChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in it, with 164 members & the work still rolling on. It is the Metropolis of the cottonmanifactoring district in England. I had not been in the place but a few minutes before I was called upon with my Brotherto visit a sister possessed with the devil & a burning fever. When we arived at the house she was in great rage & required 3 or 4 mento keep her from taring herself to peaces. We lade hands upon her & commanded the devil to come out of her in the name ofJesus Christ & also rebuked the fever & after a mighty struggle the devil came out of her, & the fever left her, & she was come [calm]& composed. The devel entered into her child next morning & made it stiff as a stake. we lade hands upon the child & rebu[k]edthe devil in the name of Jesus Christ & he instantly came out & the child fell asleep, & the woman attended meeting during the dayI do not speak of these things boasting, but thank my Heavenly Father that he is rebuking the devourer for our sakes. 19thSunday I preached to day in Manchester to a crouded congregation, it is the first time that I have preached the gospel in Englandthe people gave good attention, many that were sick came forward to be healed, we lade hands upon 20 most of which werehealed. The ordinance of Baptism was also administered. Jan 21st I left Manchester & in company with Elder Turley took coach& road (on the outside as the custom is) through Stockport, Mackelsfield, Congleton, Tunstell, & to Burslem at the Potteries & spent the night with Elder Alfred CordenThis is our place of labour for a few days or weeks. I am now in the midst if the Potteries which are so noted in England whare mostof the English china, crockery & stone were ware is made Pop. 65,000. Their ^x^ is an Elder lives in this town by the name of Alfred Cordonhe went 40 miles to recieve the work & be baptzed & was ordained an Elder. he works in the potter^i^es in Burslem 6 days in aweek for his daily bread & preaches evry evening in a week & 3 times on Sunday & he has alredy a little flock of Saints of66 in number around him. When We arived in England we found the churches under excellent order & dissipline; the Saintshave the utmost confidence in their Elders, knowing they are the servants of God. consequently they give strict heed to theirteachings. We soon expect most of the Twee^l^ve in this country. We shall then hold a general conference, & my prayer to God isthat all of the Quorum of the Twelve that come^c^ome from America will have means to come soon & labour while the day lastfor I believe that what we do in Old England must be done quickly. Elders Mullenner & Wright are in Scotland have beganto preach & to Baptize. Elder Wright has had the small pox since he went to Scotland, & the doctors told him to take medicine& keep warm or die, but he took no medicine continued to go about his business was but little sick & soon got well. persecutiondoes not rage much yet in England, sometimes the Elders get the candlesticks & candles flung at their heads while preaching &occasionally stoned in the streets but in general good attention is paid. Jan 24 I preached  in the town of Stoke Elder Turley followedme two were Baptzed. 25th Sunday I preached in Burslem & Elder Turley in Hanley. We Baptzed 3 persons. We have crouded & att[en]ti[ve]congregations. We have now sent out appointments in a number of new places in the adjoining towns. We have foundit to be the will of God to open a door immediately in Birmingham which is about 50 miles from these potteries, one of us willgo there day after tomorrow probably Elder Turley, we are determined to immediately erect the standard in evry town from thepotteries to Birmingham which is a number of large towns & vary populous & whare they have not as yet herd theword at all, But it will give at least one million of souls the privili^e^ge of hearing the word. I think some of makingBirmingham my stand for labour for a seasons as it is mear the centre of  England & contains a large number of inhabitants & will open a vast field of labour beteen the potteries & Birmingham. & we have already given out appointments partof the way. My Dear Wife As I have taken up most of this sheet in giving you an account of our journey & of the country&c. I will now give some general remarks concerning the signs of the times & the vineyard of the Lord in this Easterncountry. Signs, wonders, & fearful sights are appearing, & the words of the Ancient & modern Prophets are fulfillings in this landEearthquakes are following each other in quick succession, fires are vary frecquent. A great light lately appeared in London so that the fireman with their Engines rushed to one part of the city supposed it to be on fire but found it to be inthe heavens. At Kanturk Dec 26, 1839 300 acres of Col Lonford's bog land rose up from its mighty bed & travled with the rapidity of a steam Engine for the distance of a steam 4 miles through the country carrying destruction in its progress rising in angry surges like the ungovernable sea heaving from 10 to 30 feet of Earth upon the land in many places as it past over & in addition to these & many other signs awful awful is the state of things thoroughout England, hundreds of thousandsof people have met together in different places against the government or determined to have a reform in thegovernment they are called chartist or radicals. the Queen & parliment depend upon the Ma^i^litia toto protect them, & they have to be vary busy to break up the plots which are lade to break out in a civel war. Thousands are in a state of almost utter starvation, whole families are going th[r]ough the streets beggingBread from dore to dore. hundreds of people in one town will be turned out of the factories & out of Employ & bread in one day, & I see them standing in large groups at the corners of the streets consulting what to do, & in fact the whole face of the Earth is ripened in iniquity & sin as well as trouble & distress& it appears as though the earth was ownly spared for a little season that the worning voice may gothrough. The English Publications of late have given an account of the excitement of the Radical question &c.for my part I have nothing to do with any of these matters of the government any further than to exhortthe Saints to be as quiet as possible & be subject to the Laws of the Land & the powers that be. but it requires the greatest of prudence & wisdom to hold public meetings & do the work of God in this country at the presenttime & under the present state of things. But I believe the harvest of Old England is fully ripe & must spedily be 
 be reapted if the wheat is sowed. & God is a[s]sisting his servents in this country, & the work is begining to roll forth more & more whare it is faithfully proclaimed & signs do truly follow believers for which we feel thankful. I believe that churches will spedily be esstablished in London, Liverpool, Birmingham & that all of the capitol places of England will hear the sound of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There appears to be many looking for truth to come forth from some quarter & they appear willing to hear, receive & imbrace it when it comes unto them & while we are preaching & baptizing such as shall be saved in England our Brethren have also began to preach & baptize in Scotland & thus the work rolls on. pray for us that our work may be finished spedilythat truth may prevail upon the face of the earth. We hold a meeting every evening in a week & several times on the Sabbath & baptize almost daily. Jan 27th I preached last night in Burslem to a crowded congregation & a man came forward with two constables as I was informed to keep the peace while he read a pamphlet containing Mormon-ism unveiled W Parish's letters P. P. Pratts letters, signed Luke Johnson, & John F Boyanton [Boynton]. &c &c I was informed the man was a Methodist preacher & brought the constables with him because he feared the people. We helped him to read it what we could by giving him lights, & water to quench his thirst. I think on the whole it did no injuryI answered him when he got through, & the people herd my answer with attention.

 [sideways text] Orson Hyde Dec 29 1860 [end of sideways text]Hon.[or] W. Woodruff, Moroni Sanpete Co U TDear Brother, Dec 29, 1860.I owe you manyapologies for not earlier answering your kindletter of the 20th Ult. ins I have written to myfamily in the city but once since I left, andhave seen my wife in Sanpete but about threetimes since the President was here. I have been very busy in building me a house and inpreaching the gospel. Away from home I seldomcould find a decent pen, or a half sheet of cleanpaper. I have written a little through necessityand a very little only. I might urge many othrreasons for not writing sooner, but none for wantof a disposition to write. I have not had timeeven to write a love letter, however strong my in-clinations may have been to do so. I never labored with body and mind more intently in my lifethan during the past season. I Am now reducedto the size of a decent man. But my house isso far finished that my goods are pitched intoit, and have left my family to regulate forthemselves while I go to Fillmore where I expect to be on New Years night. I am nowon my way there.Accept my thanks for your Kindattention to my vineyard. It was a swamp 
 Snow at Springtown is about 18 Inches deep andat this place about 6, and only 6 miles apart. We havehad a beautifully mild season until Wednesday last whenthe snow fell very freely and it became intensly cold. We haveno wind storms to do us any serious damage in the countywith the exception of about one third of the roof of the Meetinghouse at Fort Ephraim which was blown off by reasonof a door being left open and the house being tight, it hadto burst. But it is all repaired. I regret the losses sustainedby our Brethren in the North, yet I am thankful that nohuman lives were lost. Speaking of Judgments, the Lordsaid, "My saints shall hardly escape." Sickness and deathare our common lot; and though the summons be directagainst us or our best friends, we have to obey the mandateSickness is only one trial to prepare us for glory, and deaththe gate through which the just enter into it.Bro. Gibson, of whom you speak, is something morethan a political Mormon, I hope. He has an extensivemission. I hope he may do good, he can do no harm to the cause.The road from the North Bend to Spanish Fork is workedthrough for horsemen and empty wagons, but to make ita good and safe thoroughfare, will require very much morelabor. Many of the citizens here have petitioned for anappropriation to work it through. Not, however, by my counselor suggestion, not but that such a measure is desirableto me; but I think the Legislation has appropriated too muchalready for individual aggrandizement with the view ofpublic good. I have counseled the people to forward their 
 Petitions to Hon G. A. Smith instead of forwarding themto a man who, after voting for a measure, turns round andsays, "you can't do any thing—it is the height of nonsenseto ask two dollars a bushel for wheat when it can bebought for a dollar or a dollar and a quarter." Wewant men who can do something. "You can't, you can't"never built, even, a house of Commons, let a lone the Kingdomof God. But when stray cattle are required to pay privateliabilities, the tone changes to, "I can, I can." This is no privacy. ItTwo weeks ago today, I preached just such a discourse inManti as I hinted to them that I should th in the second discoursethat I preached there. It made quite a fluttering in some quarters,yet the masses of the people brightened as though ten tuns burthenhad been removed from their shoulders. Many were in tears,others smiled, some as white as ghosts while the power ofGod enabled me to tell things about as existing evidencewill substantiat[e] them. One remarked that that discoursecaused many a drooping branch to lift up its headIt was a faithful warning to evil doers.When a legal Governor vetoes the acts of an illegal Legislature, it is as 'twas; and 'twas as 'tisLincoln is Elected, and God's will in that is done.The times are becoming quite interesting. The Lord help all parties on in the way they want to go.The people are gathered for meeting so I must stopwriting and go to preaching6 o'clock Sunday eveningand all is well. Your Brother in the gospelOrson Hyde 
 P.S. I perceive by the News that Bro Gardner Snow ofManti City is elected Probate Judge for this County. He isa very good man; but is completely wraped up in his sonWarren and in George Peacock. The people of Sanpetehave paid Taxes now for many years, and no improvementscan be seen but the jail half finished by Bishop Snow. Itis like all improvements in Manti, unfineshed. SeveralBack houses have been begun, but I know not one finishedThe jail in like condition. $4,500 was the contract pricefor completeing it, as I am told, when $2,000 would build andcomplete a much better building than that would be of finishedThe county is greatly in debt, and no improvements that areof much or any use at all. The tithing office has suffered,the county has suffered, the Perpetual Fund has sufferedThe people have suffered by their stoks [stock] being made intostrays and then into beef. The Indian department hassuffered, Missionaries have suffered by their donations goingin the same way. The people of Sanpete think theBourbons have reigned long enough, and that BornbasDynasty should end. If the county seat were removedforom Manti to Moroni or to Springtown it wouldsuit the notions of the people much better. If to MoroniM. D Hamilton should be Probate Judge, if to Springtown,Redick Allred should be appointed the Judge, I haveexpressed no opinion here as to the removal of the countyseat, neither any with regard to this choice of a Judgeyet the above are my true sentiments and 19 twentiethsof the people here would endorse them, the opinionof our representative to the contrary notwithstanding 
 Elder W. Woodruff said the only way forthe Committee to do was for them to dojust what Prest. Young wanted them to dolet us unite and cooperate as a people, andturn out our means to relieve Prest. Young,and become part owners of the Railroad --the Lord has blest us, and we are all betteroff, than ever before and let us find out whatour duty is and then do it -- He was willingto do all he could himself &c 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff Strongly recommended thebrethren to exercise Faith and prayer for GovernorChaffer, the Judges and the other members of the ring.& that the Lord would overrule their acts for the good ofIsrael. 
 Elder W. Woodruff regarded this school was one of the greatestpriveleges the Elders can enjoy—we are taught herehow to build up the Kingdom of God—we can seethe hand of God in inspiring his servant Brighamin opening this school, the Cooperative movement&c which soon developed a secret of plot of apostacyAnd which had been revealed to Prest Young some timebefore it was making made manifest.The cup of this Nations iniquity will soonbe filled up, and the judgments of God will breakit to pieces.He then read a little from page 79 Doc & Cov.and by making comparisons with what is foundin the Bible, Book of Mormon & Doc & Covr. pertainingto Father Adam, as to ^who^ he was &c, we can learnmuch that will strengthen our faith & comfort ourhearts.Dad by day the Gentiles who are constantlycoming up to Zion, are fulfilling the scriptures. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff  said the Lord intends to build up Zion, but the enemy is so far on the alert, that we may expect to be met on all sides. the Land question is very important, and should not be neglected, or we will suffer by it. Ours is a constant warfare, and has been from the beginning. we have got to watch and guard ourselves, lest the enemy gets an advantage over us.4God was going to build up Zion on this Land and we ought to carry out the counc^i^l of his Servants. We had got to Labour, and cease to sustain the enemies of our God.Though the Government, through its Officialsare seeking to destroy every constitutionalright, and deprive us of them, they will certainly find it a dear bought effort, for if we do our duty, God will frustrate their plans, and bring them to shame. 
 He hoped every Elder & boy in Israel, will have agood rifle and ammunition, all in readinessto defend ourselves and families, that God andAngels may see that we are willing to doanything that is required of us—but He for one had great Faith in prayer—let every saint bear up before the Lord thosewho are in our midst seeking to destroy ushe believed God will not only hear, but answerthe prayers of his Saints, which are offered upin earnestness & faith. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff said we have not sufficiently realized our responsibilitys as parents or members of the church, though he himself had always been used to work, and his wives and children also had to work and be industrious, it was not right for us to allow our children to be out late at night, and mingle with evil associations. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff had visited Fort Herriman preached there, and attended a party— He bitterly complained of conduct which he had been eyewitness to in Bp Gardners ward ^at a party^and was sorry that Bp Gardner was not presentto day—Bishops ought to be the most honest of any people in the Territory—and especially those who have charge of cooperative stores, and not permit their wives and daughters to draw goods out of the store without Keeping out any account of it—Bp Gardner ought to be had before Bp Hunterand tried for such conduct—in permitting such deviltry to exist in his ward. 
 they should be taught to respect and honour their parents.He was truly thankful for the institution of Sabbath Schools, and our children should be sent thereto learn the principles and doctrine of Christ.Some of us will soon pass away, and the responsibilities of the Kingdom of God, will fall upon the heads of our children, therefore they should be instructed in everything that pertains to the government of God. Zion will conquer, and prevail, and our duties ^which^ are ^of^ the most various kinds, if we will only attend to them,we shall gain an experience that will qualify us for increasing usefulness. We should teach our wives, (in our absence) to pray with their fachildren, and teach them to be honest.also, that when they find anything, it is not theirs, but seek to find the owner.We have been greatly blest, and softened the hearts of men in our behalf in times past,and if we do right, God will give our ^us^ power to retain our possessions and keep the balance of power in this city. 
 Elder W. Woodruff  sanctioned the remarks of the previous speaker, said no one living in the Zion of Enock would make promises and not fulfill them, and before we can enter into the order of Enock, we have got to practise the principle of righteousness 
 Elder W. Woodruff was glad to hear the voice of Prest Young's voice again, to listen to his councils - the Spirit of God had been with Prest Wells hduring his absence. He also refered to the wicked world who are much opposed to the Kingdom of God as ever, there [h]as been a strong combination among the wicked to bring us into trouble during the past winter, but we have been preserved, and have met in our School, Tabernacle & Ward Houses, without interruption. It was also a wise sugges-tion of Prest Young to introduc^e^tion the use of oxen for during much of our labour instead of Horses as a source of economy.He also named a few things about the mines.the hand of the Lord was in it, and much good would come out of it. Let farmers cultivate the soil, and every mechanic cleave to his mechanism 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we should watch and pray and especially deposit our votes on Monday next, and use every means to influence others do the same. 
 if every man would fulfil their their promises to each other, confidence will be increasedboth Joseph Smith & prest. Young have taught us the principles of Honesty and Integrity and we should try to carry them out.The rules of the School are just and good,and we should observe them.We cannot be saved in the Celestial Kingdom of God, unless we practise principles of righteousness & Honesty—it does not pay any of us to do wrong—He teaches hischildren to be honest, and he believes they will grow up as Honest men.We must not encourage our children to do wrong, if we do, they are lit almost sure to make it manifest as they grow up.Let us set good examples before our wives and children.He then recommended the brethren to get up what Horses or Cattle they have over Jordan, if not, we shall certainly lose them, for their is no feed for them there.Put them in Cooperative Herds where they can be taken where proper care of 
 by and bye, we shall see the wisdom that God has in permitting them to be opened here & thereHe had been absent a few days looking out a Herd ground for a Cooperative Herd, and hoped the brethren would rally round the effort and help it along.Zion will arise, and triumph on the face of the earth, and all opposition will have to give way, and the Kingdom will be built up. We must attend to our prayers, and our works must be good, and we shall have a home here, and the wicked and ungodly will have nopower to prevent it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff felt thankful that he lived to see the commencement of a grand cooperative movement, which he had no doubt would continue until it circumscribed the whole of our temporal matters. We should learn to sustain ourselves, and leave off as fast as possible the patronage of our enemies. Let alone those who support our bitter enemies. He heartily endorsed this movement, and prayed that we might grow brighter and brighter. Motioned & Seconded, & CarriedThat the Constitution be accepted and the Books be opened for subscription. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said the nearer we get to the Lord, the more mercy we see displayed towards erring humanity - hence it is that Prest Young entertains the most mercifulfeelings towards those who have done wrong and would gladly assst towards reclaiming them. And he for one did not feel like saying anything to oppose it 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff Gave out a notice of a 1/4 Sec. of land in the Pulsipher field, and requested all landowners of that 1/4 Section to meet at the close of the School, as some-thing had to be done, or the land would be lost. 
 Elder W. Woodruffrecommended us to travel in travelshallow water, and not to trouble ourselves about the mysteries that are all around us- spoke of the increase of infidelity among the nations of the world.Let any one deny the Holy Ghost and the atonement of Jesus Christ, then the Devil leads them to lead shed innocent blood. 
 Elder W. Woodruff gave a graphic account of his experience with a very severe Snow Storm, on his way from Randolph to Evanston, having to travelsome 15 miles in the Storm, and after a very providential opening, he reached Ogden, and finally to this City, in health and strength, for which he acknowledges the hand of the Lord.It is our duty to trust in God, be diligent,and faithful & true in all our duties to God and each other, and the Kingdom will be established in spite of all the opposition that is now arrayed against it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said ever since he was a little boy, he never could think there was anybody on the earth that loved the Lord, unless there was a Head and body of the Church, which is so beautifully exprest by the Apostle Paul.He had observed a greadt many cripples in his life, some lacking one limb and some another- but he never say ^saw^ any without a Head- so with the Christian world, having no Head, are without life, just as much as a natural body, without a Head  one. He was not at all surprised at the persecution we are receiving, he was astonishedthat we did not have more, but God will bring us off victorious. Since we had openly come out with the principle of Polygamy, God had thrown a shield around us, and protected us. 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said the Lord never fails in any promise that he gives to the children of men. He deals with men in on the most broad democratic principles. The Law that God has revealed to us in this day, is easily understood by the most illiterate—this Law of the Gospel was given that man might be brought back into his presence, and exalted in the Celestial Kingdom, but the human family must abide the Law, as or they cannot gain the promise. He felt to rejoice that Prest.Young was here with us again—when he was first arrested, he said, that all their efforts would turn out a great fizzle—the Prayers of the servants of God have prevailed, and God has delivered those ^who^ were inbonds. We should never lose sight of the promises,and so live, that we can lawfully claim them.When Pres.t Young first set foot on this temple block, he put down his cane upon it and said, Here the greater Temple of God will be built.No man who has l ever lifted up his hand against this Kingdom, as ever pro^s^pered. No weapon that was ^is^ formed against Zion can prosper. this prophecy has been most remarkably fulfilled.We shall prosper, if we keep the commandments of God-the Hand of God has been over us as a people. 
 The Nation we live in, has become corrupt with Whoredoms, Thieving, & every foul crime that will shortly sink it to perdition. It may be that the highest tribunal in the land, viz The Supreme Court, may also be induced to turn against us -- the President has tried his hand, and perhaps Congress may legislate against us -- but the Lord willbring us off victorious. And this nation will fill up the measure of their iniquity. 
 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day SaintsP.O. Box, B. Salt Lake City, Utah. March 19th, 1894.Elder Cornelius D. Schettler,Dear Brother:I have taken it upon myself to write a few lines to our youngElders who went together from Salt Lake upon their first mission toGermany. We have had a number of letters from Owen, and I have likedvery much the spirit of them.Mrs. Woodruff and myself took supper with your father andmother on the 14th and we had a good time. Herman and Irene made ussplendid music. A good deal was said about Cornelius' mission and theother boys. Of course, you are now beginning to make your first markin the ministry. I have been there before you and I know what it is;though you have the language to learn, which I did not. I went on myfirst mission without purse or srcrip. I went through the wilderness, waded swamps, traveled alone as a priest, and baptized many that I couldnot confirm.  You are a Seventy and can attend to all the ordinancesnecessary in organizing branches of the Church. I have great hopes inyou young men. I suppose you naturally will have some difficulty inpreaching to these foreign governments considering the laws and politics.But I think there is a good deal of the blood of Israel in Germany andSwitzerland. We have everything to encourage us in searching out hthehonest in heart among the nations. The Lord told Oliver Cowdery that ifhe spent his whole life in saving one soul how great would be his joy inthe eternal world over that one soul. I have felt that I have greatcause to rejoice in that respect; I have had the credit of bringing more 
 souls into the Church than any one man in the Church; I do not know howthat is. I brought two thousand into the Church in the south of England-in Herefordshire, &c., in 1840; but I never felt to boast or to take anycredit to myself in any of these things, for it was God not WilfeordWoodruff that did it. Yet I felt it was a great blessing to be aninstrument in the hands of God of performing siuch a work. So I look uponyou young brethren who are sent now to the nations of the earth to preachthe gospel and save the souls of men.  No greater or more glorious workcould you be called to.  Therefore, my dear brother, take hold with allyour might. Call upon the Lord in mighty prayer for the Holy Ghost tobe with you to give you power to preach the Gospel and give you souls insearch of your ministry, and the Lord will hear your prayers and giveyou power to accomplish a good mission which will be a satisfaction toyourself and your friends and acceptable unto God who has called you.And this applies not only to yourself, but to every Elder with you, andall who are in the vineyard of the Lord. Therefore, fear not, but laborfaithfully to prune the vineyard once more for the last time and preparethe earth for the coming of the Son of Man. Avoid all evil, resist alltemptations, and the angels of God will be your constant companions.Give my love and blessing to Prest. Naegle and wife and all theElders with you. I am interested in the welfare of every Elder laboringin the vineyard of the Lord.Spencer Clawson's wife died last week, and will be buried onSunday. I would be glad to hear from you and know how you are gettingalong. Sister Woodruff, Blanch and Alice join me in love to you and Bro.and Sister Naegle.From your Brother in the Gospel, Wilford Woodruff

Sal.Kjebenhavn, Sept. 12 1893.President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake CityDear Brother:When I was appointed to take charge of theScandinavian Mission, May 1st Bro. JosephChristiansen turned over to me as "Resources," a list of notes due this Offise from parties nowin Utah, which notes, according to your suggestionshad been sent to you for colection, in order tohelp this office out with the much neededfunds.  I write this by way of a reminder.I will also state, that during the last few monthsbut very little money has been sent from home, tothis office for Emigrations; The few emigrantsthat has goen this summer, has mostly goenon money that has been to thier or here for a longtime, and as stated above, but very little hascome from home to Reimburse the office.  Wehave had several calls from home for money, thathas been sent here for Emigrations, but when theparties, for whom it was intended could not go "atonce", the money was recalled.  I suppose becauseof the hard times at home and the scarcity of money.All this has drained us interely and we arenot now able to remit to Liverpool the fullamounts for the emigrations as they go.  If

I expect Prest.Lund over here next week and I shall thentake great plasure in showing him thecondision of the mission financily,  I hopeto hear from you favorably on this matter.The work of God is progressing in thislands, many are investigating the Gospelafpecialy in Norway and Sweden and if weonly had more missionaries to send upthere much more good could be done.I remain yours in the Gospel of christC. A. CarlquistBro. Jack sayes, we are doing the best wecan to collect those notes, but in these hardtimes, no one seems able to pay,  and thereis but little hope of getting the money just now.Besides the Copenhagen office has drawn on the Lpool office and the latter has drawnon this office, and will no doubt continueto do so.J.

Brother Anderson came here last May and was according to your wish, sent to the City of Stockholm, where he gained admittance to the best school in this country for the study which he was to pursue—Figure Molding. When Prest. Lund and I visited Stockholm conference last fall we had several talks with brother Anderson and learned that he was progressing very rapidley, using every opertunity offered for study.

Sal.Kjebenhavn March 13 1891President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City.Dear Brother:We need thirty missionaries for the ScandinavianMission as early as possible in the Fall of 1891. As tonationality and dialect, they should be divided as follows:Danish, 8: for Stockholm and Goteborg, Sweden, 12; forSkane, Sweden, 4; for Christiania, Norway, 6.Our progress during the past four months,has averaged that of the past two winters. A numberof the older brethren, however, have been unable to work,owing to sickness, which has crippled our work some.As far as I know; all are now well.The present edition of the Danish Hymn Book isnearly exhausted, and before a new edition is published,the work should be carefully revised, which should bedone so that we could send it to press next winter.I think this labor is of great importance, as it is afact that our hymns have a great influence in spread-ing the truth, and numbers of people have been con-verted by hearing and reading our songs. I suggest,therefore, that a committee of interested and capableScandinavians be selected to do the revising, which, tosave expence, should be done at home in Utah, and thework sent over here for publication.  To make it whatit should be, there are a number of improvements needed 
 in the book which will be fully apparent to those whoundertake the task. The meter should be changed in a number of the songs so as to make these suitable forour psalmody music instead of the folk-lore melodysnow used, which are often very inappropriate ina house of worship; and more of the principles anddoctrines should be treated upon with less of Zionand the gathering, which latter not only the Saints, buteven strangers are often too eager to embrace. Aconsiderable proportion of those who emigrate eachyear are Gentiles, and our people are continuallysending for their friends who care nothing in a num-ber of instances, for the Gospel, but often prove ofgreat injury to the cause by returning unfavorablewritings to these lands, after they are gathered.Elders J. M. Sjodahl, P. O. Thomasen, and C. C. A. Chris-tensen would be among the best that could be foundto do the work of revision, or to supervise it, with the assistance of such other talent as might be selected.Elder C. E. Thorstensen, a good choir leader, who is nowworking in this office, but who expects to return home next Fall, would be of much assistance in the workowing to his musical ability, and his familiarity withthe wants of choirs and singers in this mission.Hoping that these matters will received yourfavorable consideration, and praying God to bless youabundantly, I remain,Your brother in the Gospel of Christ,Edw. H. Anderson.

Kjebenhavn Nov. 8 1890President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City.Dear Brother:I have just made a round tour of this mission, leaving here on Oct. 4th, and returningon the 3d of the present month. I have sent Prest. Young an account in detail of our conferences, andof matters as I found them. The work is progress-ing quite favorably in this mission, and especiallydo we find many in Northern Sweden who investi-gate the principles of the Gospel. During the pastsix months there have been 312 baptisms in the mission.We will need 20 missionaries next spring, which should be divided as follows: Danes—5; from Stockholm or Goteborg, North-ern Sweden—7; from S Kane, southern Sweden—4; from Norway—4,. We can not use South-ern Swedes for the north part of that country;and as the northern portion is the bestfield we hope to have the full quota forthat part as early as they can be sent over;in fact, it would be well if they were nowin the field.I take the liberty of suggesting that we 
 Den skandinaviske Missions Kontor.Lorentzensgade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.Kjebenhavn 189need a Danish writer and a Swedish writer, torelieve the brethren who are now laboring in that calling. It is well to have them on hand, so as tofamiliarize themselves with their work, some lengthof time before the present laborers leave. I suggestas the Danish translator Elder O. J. Anderson, ofCastle Dale, Emery Co. and as the Swedish translator, Elder Charles Kallstrom of Logan. These brethrenshould be here early in the summer. We needalso some specially qualified men to relieve the Conference presidents who will return next sum-mer and fall. I suggest the following namesfrom which a selection could be made:Danes: Jos.

Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, UtahDear Brother:  I herewith enclose a list ofnames of persons recommended as being quali-fied and capable of filling missions in Scan-dinavia, and if you deem it proper we wouldbe pleased to have them called and sent to thesecountries to assist in the work of the Lord.I sent a similar list to Prest. Young at Liver-pool on the 9th Jan., but for some cause it can notnow be found there, and, having been mislaid, ithas not been forwarded to you.  It is thereforeby the suggestion of Prest. Young, or the brotherat Liverpool having charge of the mission,that I send this list direct to you.  It is nowvery late, but these Elders were intended to havebeen among the Spring supply of missionaries.You have no doubt by this time been informedof the number of needed for Scandinavia -- 30,(12 Swedes, 8 [Norwegians ] and 10 Danes.)By request of Prest. Young, I also send youa list of notes due this office from parties mostby residing in Utah.  These amounts have beenloaned to the respective parties on their promiseof paying same as specified in the notes; some

Sal.Kjebenhavn, _______ 189__.of these accounts are now nearly ten yearsold, and, to judge from the past, they willnever be paid if left in this office.  I wouldsuggest, that these notes be sent to the churchoffice in Salt Lake City for collection, andthis office, if possible, get credit for the a-mounts, as the Scandinavian Mission canill afford to do without the means.  No doubtif the notes are presented for collection athome, the greater portion at least will bepaid, but if left here, it is very doubtful.This money was borrowed from amountson hand here for emigrations purposes, and,besides this amount, we have a borrowedbalance from the same source of Kr. 6827.25or L379.5 "  9 3/4 (about $1845.00)By this you can judge of our financialcondition, and any disposition you canmake in favor of the mission is greatly need-ed and will be thankfully received.Awaiting your favor,I remain,Your brother in the Gospel,Joseph ChristiansenPrest.

 Wilford Woodruff made remarks of a similar character. This work cannot stand still, it must go forward or go backward. 
 Elder W. Woodruff  spoke of the necessity of pruning the tree off the dead branches from the tree, and those who would not pay their tithing, did not deserve the fellowshipof the saints, and ought to be cut off 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said the best time for Farmers to pay their tithing was at the time they raise their produce, before they put it away in their bins and cellars - 
 Elder Woodruff mentioned an instance in his experience while with Elder Patten, who on one occasion, whenthe people had rejected their testimony—washed their feet, as a testimony against them; he did know that God backed up and sustained the testimony of the lessor priesthood, but the power spoken of in the section just readhe thought was of a more special character, than that commonly held by ^all^ Elders who go forth to preach the gospel. 
 Elder W. Woodruff bore testimony to the truth of Pres.t. Wells re-marks—and named an instance of bearing testimony to a number of individuals, especially one who had once held the priesthood &c—and apostatized, he was constrained by the spirit to go and warn him three times, the man was coming towards him, and fell dead at his feet. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said it was very plain, that the judgments of God commenced upon the inhabitants of this wicked world—after the introduction of the Gospel—especially this and other civilized or ^Christian^ nations—this is according to all the revelations we have on the subject. 
 Elder W. Woodruff, said, all the outside world were united in fighting against Zion—and the great work of the Almighty God had to be carried out by the handful of people in these vallies—and if we have not faith enough as yet, to enter into the Order of Enock, we surely have sufficient to enter upon an effort of co operation, like the one suggested.We are too anxious to get rich as a people, and get Railroad stock, or Bank stock &c 
 Elder W. Woodruff said he did not believe either ^in^ one or the other of those doctrines. but he did believe that many who went in the spirit world, who will receive the Gospeland enter into the Celestial Kingdom—and moreover that those who have had one wife sealed to them over the Alter, and should die before they had a chance to obtain a second, would certainly be entitled to a Celestial Glory. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said that while he acted under the Aaronic priesthood, as a priest, God manifested his power quite as much as since he held the Apostleship, he gave him dreams and visions &c, no matter what priesthood a man may hold, if he magnified it, God would own and bless him under it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff ^said^ that he did not think it wisdom to have our minds exercised about any matter that revelation was silent upon,and as to whether or not, the high priesthood was enjoyed between the time of Moses and the Saviour, did not really concern us, as we had many pressing duties that should engage our attention in preference. 
 Elder W Woodruff felt very thankful for the changes that are now being made, especially in the Temporal affairs of the Kingdom of God, a vast amount of responsibilites had been upon the shoulders of Prest Young for a long time as the leading Spirit of all the great enterprizes in our midst, such as the Railroad, Zions Coope Merchantile Instn, The Bank &c.He felt that the Kingdom of God was moving onward at a very rapid ^rate^, hence the necessity of new offices, and more good men being called into active service, not only in Temporal but spiritual things. Was much pleased with the Patriarchal Ordination being extended to others, to meet the growing wants of the people. 
 Elder W Woodruff spoke of the drivings and fightings of the Indians by the Government, the hand of the Lord was over that people, there is a great work for them to do in building up Zion & the new Jerusalem, they will certainly be inspired, and ^receive^ revelations from God, and we who have come into the Gospel a little before them, and we should exerciise faith for them, and pray for them. A few days us after they came into the Vallies, they saw a few Indians who came to their camp, and they gave them some bread 
 since that time, we have grown and the Lord has blest us, and the Indians are better fed and clothed than they were. we have many duties to perform towards the Indians.God alone is our friend and the Lamanites around us, had they li not been a portion of the House Indians of Israel they would have been cut off root and branch long agothey are of the seed of Joseph, and God requires us to look after their salvation. He Prophesied in the name of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that this Government ^or nation^ was nearly ripe for the Damnation of Hell. He spoke of the first Elders of the Church who had been taken away, for a wise purpose, it was necessary for an organization in this dispensation behind the vail, he believes that Joseph had lived his time out until done his work. Let us do right, build up Zion, and establish the Kingdom. Keep the commandments of God, and no earthly power can drive us from these vallies. 
 Elder W Woodruff felt satisfied that very many of our people do not pay their tithing, he kept an account of his money receipts and the products of the earth, and paid a tenth of each the law of tithing was of God, and none can neglect it without suffering loss, it has never been annulled, and has been in existance ever since the days of Adam, we shall prosper by Keeping the commandments of God, and visa, versa. 
 Elder W Woodruff said there was a great contrast between the laws, refered to and the Celestial law as given through the Gospel, if the eyes of the people of this City were opened, they would be more alive to their duties, and would hunger and thirst after righteos-ness. We are living under great priveleges, and have had many keys and principles pertaining to the living and the dead - he denounced the fashions of the Babylon which are so eagerly sought after by our Wives and Daughters - We have a great amount of preaching and are more or less responsible for this privelege.  Many of the Elders are giving way to Smoking & Drinking &c which he was sorry to see. 
 Elder W. Woodruff  spoke of the opposing element to the priesthood from the days of Joseph until now, the many excellent traits of character in Prest Young, as coined by his works, the necessity of wise legislation, by good men, to be of good courage, do right, be faithful and united, then Congress and her many bills cannot hurt us. 
 Elder W. Woodruff also adverted to the unreliability of memory especially after a great lapse of time since the sayings had been made he himself has written a great many sayings and sermons of Joseph Smith, but when once written they invariably left his memory.The Lord lead and instructed the Prophet Joseph like a child and many things he was taught, he had but a very imperfectunderstanding at first, his on the resurection changedsomewhat prior to his death. He then traced the principle of progressin the dealings of God with his people, since the rise of the church especially in reference to Baptisms for the dead, The calling of Elders to preach the Gospel &c 
 Elder W. Woodruff has noticed that all Hell had been opposed to the Priesthood ever since the rise this church and where is the man whose works speak more favorably than Pres.t is the man whose works speak more favorably than Pres.t Young, yet he is not without falt, neither is any other man perfect, we are called to legislate for the best interests of the people, we have not got the light we might have as Apostles, Elders &c — but bring forward your good men that will guard the liberties of the people, this is a good place to select them, and he would vote for them.  This is an important time and we have got to build up the Kingdom of God, no matter what Congress may do, nor how many bills they may pass.Let us reason together, and have the Spirit of God for we are the only friends that God has got, therefore let us be faithful and unite together and maintain our position in these mountains 
 Elder W. Woodruff stated that inasmuch as Dr Benedich is a member of the church, should he not be dealt with for lying about their his brethrenHe also suggested the propriety of getting up a ticket here to night& Elder Orson Pratt seconded the suggestion carried unanimously 
 Elder Woodruff made some remarks about the Municipal Elec-tion to-day in which he gave his views about those who suffered their names to stand in oppossition to the expressed wish of the saints and be voted for by our enemies. 
 Elders John Taylor & W. Woodruff ventilated the subject at considerable length,showing the absolute necessity of ^for^ a change in our Temporal matters, in order to unite and bind us together as a community, or we will never have power among the Nations, this Dispensation comprizes in it, every good principle that existed in all past dispensations. Celestial Law & Baptism for the dead were revealed just at the right time, so the Order of Enock comes along when circumstances that now surround us, demand a change in our social policy. 
 Prest. Wells & Elder Woodruff each bore testimony to the remarkable quality of our soil, especially adapted to the growth of wheat, having tested for a thousand years and received the washings from these mountains, each gave some timely council to the cultivators of the soil shewing the necessity of replenishing it I with manure to prevent its entire exhaustion of the Wheat element, as was the case in some countries, where wheat used to be grown in great quantitites, now they cannot grow a bushel, we have in this Territory some of the choicest virgin soil in the world, but and needs care and cultureto preserve it - 
 Elder W Woodruff  said there never was anything revealed to this people, as raised the Devil so universally as this united orderand no one who either acts as Ananias did, or tries to safe draw off and throw cold water upon it, ^but^ what little sap there is, will run out of them. He 
 Mt. Pleasant UtahJune 24 + 1898President W. Woodruff -and CouncilorsS L City,Dear Brethren:--As I did not have the opportunity of seeing youwhen I called at your Office last week when I returnedfrom my mission to Scandinavia's I deem it proper towrite you and give you a brief report of theMission and the labor performed there during the lasttwo years.  During those years there have been onan average 125 Utah Elders and 4 or 5 natives inthe field and when I left here there were 150.According to the reports received there has been some 200,000Families visited by our Elders, and about the same numberof tracts distributed, and over one thousand souls havebeen added to the church.  The ages of theElders there averagesfrom 18 to 73.  We find that the climate in thosenorthern lands is very trying on our Brethren, especiallyon this advanced in years, not so much on account 
 of extreme cold, as on account of the damp and heavyatmosphere, rain and fog.  We have a number of menthere now past 60 and where they have to take theirchances in the field in common write others it is almostmore than they are able to stand.The Elders have with scarsely an exception labored dilligently and with good success and the blessings and powerof god have followed them in their ministry.  We have onvarious occasions seen the power of God made manifestin a remarkable manner.  The sick have beenrestored to health where they in some instances hadbeen lying on their beds of affliction for many yearsand to all human appearance there was but little orno hope for their recovery.-We have met with but very little interference fromgovernment officials or from the clergy.  Our motto has beento respect and honor those to whom honor was due, andto observe the laws of the countries where we were laboringand exercise love and charity for all and malice towardnone, hence we have been treated ^with^ courtesy and respect.On One or two occasions some of our Elders were banishedfrom Denmark, this was done on complaints centeredby the Ministers of the State Church who thought theywere annoying them by their presence.-- 
 under those circumstances we have simply transferedthem to Sweden or Norway.Some 300 have emigrated from that mission duringthe past two years, and nearly all on money sent themby their friends in Utah.  The fact that we have beeninstructed not to encourage Emigration, but ratherencourage the Saints to remain and help to build up andstrengthen the branches of the Church where they arehas proven a great benefit to our work in thoselands, as the good Saints who live exemplary lives areamong our very best missionariesWe have encouraged the Saints everywhere, althoughpoor, to pay their tithing, and we have heard manyenspiring testimonies from them how the Lord hasmade good His promises and blessed them as a rewardfor their faithfulness.  The people in Scandinaviado not seem to be so hospitable as are the people ofthe U S hence our Elders find it very difficultto travel without money, but as a rule the managerto get along with a little.  The general feeling andSpirit among the people is more liberal and tolerantthen years go, and the prejudin so strong andpronmuced against us in early days, is muchmodified.  One great drawback to our work in 
 the cities is the want of suitable, and I may say respectable, places where to hold our religious serviceswe have encouraged a bettering of conditions in thatline.  We have in all the Conferences and in manyof the principle branches, good choirs provided withorgans, and they are a great help to our work,but we have been much in need of men of talentin that line. -The Gospel is more and more attracting the attentionof the more intelligent and better classes of the peopleand there is at present an exellent prospect forthe work in Scandinavia.  I am not enclined toshare in the sentiment often expressed by ourElders: that the harvest is over and we are butgleaning, but rather think that the precious seedsown in our day will yet bear a rich harvest -The mission was a few years ago involved ina heavy debt, part of that was canceled by PrestP. Sundwall, my predecessor, and I am pleasedto be able ^now^ to report the mission out of debt and ina good footing financially as well as otherwise. 
 #2Elder George Christensen, who has been by your appointedto take charge of the mission temporarly, has laboredwith me in the office for the past two years, partof the time as writer and translator for the danishStar, and has rendered me very valuable assistance,he is a young man of exceptional abilities, and wellqualified for the position he now fills. - We are also publishing a Star in the Swedishlanguage, of which Elder Geo, A. Brandt of Salinais the writer and translator. -Personally I feel pleased to return to my familyfriends at home, and find all well --.My mission has been full of interest andexperiences to me and I trust it has been of courseprofit to the work of God and the people among whereI have labored.Hoping that this brief Statement may take the place ofa personal report and be thus accepted by youI have the honor to subscribe myself--Your Brother in the GospelC. N. Lundover 
 P. S. I here inclose financial Statement -You will see that although this notes inyour Office is connected in our favor.Should they be worthless, we are not relyingupon them, we can throw them all out ifnecessary and be on the square anyhow.but likely something will be realized fromthem.Lund -Excellent report.

He arrived here as aMissionary, June 29, 1895, and was appointed by Pres. Sunduvallto labor in Stockholm Conference. His field of labor wasSolvarbo Branch in Dalarne, where he, in connection withElder Lennberg, has performed a good work, laboringthere until death call him hence.A day or two before his death he separated from ElderLen^n^berg, making an appointment to meet him a few dayslater. Elder Björkman remained in Solvarbo to preparethe report of the Branch to be forwarded to Stockholm.On the 19th of Aug, he seemed to be in his usual healthand partook of dinner with the family of Saints with whom he was staying. After dinner he went with theminto the field where the work of harvesting was going on.

Hastening to his side, theyfound him apparently lifeless, and all attemp^t^s toarouse him proved in vain. A physician was then sum-moned who after a brief examination, pronounced himdead, ^and gave as the cause a bursting of a bloodvessel in the head,^ stating that death had come without pain.As Solvarbo is located in a sparsely settled andmountainous region some 130 miles from Stockholm, meansof communication are very primitive, and two days lapsedbefore the Saints could find his partner, Elder Lennberg,who, when found, wired the sad news to Stockholm andthence it was forwarded here. A letter was sent fromhere to the Office at Liverpool, containing the news; butwe waited for further particulars before sending the word home, as we did not know where he died, northe address of his family, or whether word had beensent to them from Sweden. Further particulars couldnot be had here until the Brethren from Stockholm reachedthe scene of his death, which necessarily consumed considerabletime. Upon receipt of the first news from Solvarbo wewired you, and having just now received a completeaccount of the death and funeral, forward you same.As soon as Bro. Ahlquist, President of Stockholm Conference,and the Elders with him arrived, necessary steps were imme-diately taken for the funeral, Temple clothing having been prepared

 President W. Woodruff. I desire to make a few remarks, with the President's permission. Theordinance of washing of feet was introduced byJoseph associated with the School of the Prophets;there was also a washing of feet connected withthe endowments given in the Kirtland Templewhich was continued until the time the Saintsleft there. In Nauvoo, he introduced theendowments we are receiving to-day.I agree with President Taylor's views withregard to our giving endowments. I do thinkwe should be more cautious and careful whowe receive into our Endowment House to givethem full endowments. With regard to givinga portion thereof, and then letting candidatesprove themselves worthy before receiving therest, that of course is a matter to be left toPrest. Taylor. I do not believe, however, thata man should be allowed to go into thathouse who does not pay tithing, and whodrinks and curses and swears.President Taylor. And breaks the Sabbath dayPresident Woodruff. Yes, sir; a man who breaksthe Sabbath day has no business there. 
 1883-09-28President W Woodruff: I want to say tothe First Presidency that we havebeen together as a quorum since thismornings meeting except for one hour.We have had a free and full talkupon our individual affairs--uponour family matters, thupon the word ofwisdom, the duties and responsibilitiesthat devolve upon us as apostles &c.And we have come to the conclusionthat we will now fully observe the Wordof Wisdom as we have all more or lessbeen negligent upon that point, that wewill conduct our personal lives and the 
 affairs of our families in a moreconsistent manner in the future ^and^ inconformity with our calling andhigh profession as apostles of theLord Jesus Christ.  ThatWe have examinedinto the reported crimniality of BrotherCarrington while in England, and havehad a full explanation from him ofthose matters, and find there is nocriminality to be attached to him yet hewas very unwise and imprudent in hiscourse while abroad which might havehavegiven cause for grave suspicions.Bro Carrington ^is^ also convinced that his conductwas not such as became consistent withhis calling as an apostle.Bro John W Young has also expressed hisdesires to more fully live up to the requirements 
 of his religion and to magnify hiscalling. Hence we havepassed upon and accepted each ofthe members of our quorum who havebeen with us dto day and nowpresent, and now submit ourselvesand our action for the consideration ofthe First Presidency. 
 ^Apostle^ W. Woodruff, Endorsed ^the^ teachings ofPresident Taylor. Felt a change wascoming on the church and ^on^ the world spoke of ^the greatness of^ coming eventsfor which a people had to be prepared,and that revelation would be given tofit us for the work, and to stand inthe midst of the judgments, or else wego down with the rest ^of the world^. We ought towake up, and ^get our^our hearts set upon thebuilding up of the Kingdom of God. Then 
 President W. Woodruff said this meetinghad been called for a purpose that wouldhereafter be revealed. It would requirethe brethren to keep their own council.There are ordinances in this house that aresacred and should not be revealed. All theordinances are sacred, and we must learnto keep our own councils.A note was then taken not to reveal any thing 
 there would be no lack of means. Feltlike Pres. Taylor there would have to be a change in the giving of endownments.Refd where prayer of Joseph and the answerhereto ^to be found in the Book of Doctrine & Covenants,^ with its complete fulfillment. ^He continued,^ I believethat this priesthood has power with theheavens, Our man power-slaves Somecalled us slaves, why do we submit toour leaders, because we know what theyare controlled of God and empowered byhim; we are no more slaves, than itcould be consistintly said that Gabriel,Michael & other ^angels^ are slaves to God. in Thepriesthood will prevail, as the world willfind out. God has not stopped givingrevelation; Revelation regarding workin the temples for our dead &c WhenIsrael rises up ^& lives their religion^ then we shall nothave trouble about glory [shaps] &c 
 that should transpire in our meeting.,which was carried unanimously.Prest Woodruff said that the time hadcome for us to enter a higher plane andto understand the further ordinances ofthe Kingdom of God.
