 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints.    P.O. Box B.    Salt Lake City, Utah, March 23rd, 1896.    ELDERS JAMES E. STEELE,  ROBERT L. BYBEE,  JOS. S. MULLINER,    Presidency of the Bingham Stake.    Dear Brethren:    Your letter of the 13th inst., addressed to President  George Q. Cannon, contains an enquiry concerning the correct language  to be used in ordaining a man to the office of an Elder. You say some  little difference of opinion exists among the brethren of your Stake on  this point.    We do not like to write out a form of ordination for the  office of an Elder. But it is a very simple ceremony, as are all the  ceremonies connected with the ordinances. This is beautifully illustra-  ted in the form which the Lord gives, on page 609 of the Book of Mormon,  concerning the ordination of Priests and Teachers.    There are some people who seem to attach great importance  to phraseology, and are very technical, and think things are not done  right unless every word is spoken just as it should be. This is not  right. A spirit of that kind leads to disputations as to forms; and we  find considerable of that arising from time to time in theological clas-  ses and among others. That which is necessary in ordaining a man is  to ordain him to the office in the Aaronic Priesthood or the Melchisedek  Priesthood (whichever it may be) by the authority of tyhe Holy Priesthood 
 and in the name of Jesus. This, in a few words, is all that we think  necessary to be said upon the subject.    With kindest regards,    Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said we all stood in need of   Faith, especially at the present time, we have ^had^ good   peace for a great many years, and he had no doubt  but every one would sooner or later be tried to   the very core. We should be prepared for every   thing that may come along. We are the friends   of God, and the world is it war with us, and   he was glad of it. God has put into our  hands the Gospel of Christ, the Kingdom of God,   and that makes the world mad, as for   Polygamy they did not care so much for it,   as for the dust under their feet.    If it requires the United States to shed more  blood of the saints, before their cup is full, they   will shed it, there never was a more corrupt   nation dwell on the face of the earth, than   that which now exists on this covenant.    And the saints should never in their prayers 
 forget to pray for Colfax, and the Government   in the right way. We have everything to   encourage us in doing right -- to keep the word   of Wisdom, and whatever is required of us    No man ever apostatizes from this church   without transgressing the laws of God, either   secretly or openly -- the Spirit of God will   never leave any one without sufficient cause.    Prest Young is not without Revelation,   he is not without the power and Spirit of God,   he has councilled the saints for a great many years,   by the mind and will of God, and if everything   had to be done by Revelation, many of us would   now be living under great condemnation. 
 Elder W. Woodruff in his acquaintance with Joseph   Smith & Brigham Young, said he never knew  either to give any council but what always   came out true, instancing the Sidney Rigdon  whom Joseph wished to through [throw] off &c    We have got to follow the Lord—  the Celestial law must be abided or we   never can be exhalted.    Prest. Young is our Lawgiver and stands  between us and God, and if God has   any revelation to give to man, he will  not give it to him ^me^, nor Billy Godbe, but   it will come through Prest. Young—  he will speak through his mouthpiece  God has placed him as our leader in   temporal as well as in other things—we  shall be dictated by revelation and council  and those who abide it and will be saved. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff. Moved and was seconded  That this meeting be turned into a caucus  meeting, for the purpose of making nominating   our City Officers, preparatory to the forthcoming   Election. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we were approaching   a very interesting time, and as the Lord  will have a tried people—we shall ^have^ a severe   test to prove and try the saints—something   that make us look around us, and ascertain   where we shal stand—the nation on this   continent is nearly ripe in iniquity, and will  certainly be destroyed, according to the revelations   given to Joseph—Men that are not ground  in their faith by revelation, must past away   in the trying hour—every weapon that   is formed against us, will not prosper—  Let the Elders read the revelations and become   acquainted with them—that we may see  what is coming—The Lord does not   require us to make war upon our enemies  until he reveals it from heaven—    He could afford to lay down his temporal  life, rather than forfeit his eternal salvation—  If it was necessary let Prest Young and others   be hid up in these mountains—but he did   not think the Lord was going to destroy the   faithful saints of God—but let every faithful  Man of God be willing to assume his share of   responsibility, instead of throwing everything on the 
 Elder W. Woodruff said, this being a school of ^the^ prophets,  should be profitable to those who come here, the spirit of God   that each Elder possesses is the spirit of prophesy--we have   had the living oracles in our midst for 40 years on the   6th April next--And as a people we have got to   prepare a place for the coming of the Son of Man--  the United States had been warned ^lately^ by several hundred  missionaries, perhaps for the last time, and their   testimonies will stand good before God, Angels and   Men--the situation of the people required   the Servants of God to interfere with temporal  things, and council and instruct them in the   principle of cooperation &c, this gives offence to some,  but all things are necessary from time to time --  he then urged the necessity of each one who   comes to this school, observing the rules which we   have covenanted to observe -- We want an   increase of faith, so as to meet all the opposition   and persecution we may have to encounter.    He then commended the Calmness and composure   of our leader Prest Young, under the most trying 
 shoulders of Prest Young—    There was a very wicked spirit in this City, which   was connected with the same lying spirit at Washington.    When Colfax was here, he had the pleasure of preach-  ing the Gospel to him and warn him against shedding  innocent blood—let us stand valiently and bear   our testimony, and leave the event in the hands of God   let us go before the Lord, and pray that Hypocrites and   liars may be gathered out. 
 circumstances, encouraged the school to put their   trust in God, and be united, and do our duty,  And our Leaders will be inspired to lead this people  in a straight path and Zion will be built up --  and the Go blessings of God will rest upon   his people, and may thHe enable each one to   do their is my prayer in the name of Jesus -- 
 Elder W. Woodruff, loved to see men valient in   a good cause, especially in the testimony of   Jesus—He had known Elder Taylor as far back  as Kirtland, stand up nobly in defending the   prophet Joseph—The spirit made manifest   here to day, he had no doubt existed among  all the Elders of Israel.    This was the great Kingdom of our God, and   our Government will not rot and come to 
 Elder W. Woodruff . said a Man must live his religion   if he expects to be benefited by it.  He was satisfied that a faithfull man of God will  have his reward    One fault among latter day saints was a looseness   in paying his obligations. We should improve in this   No one apostatizes from this church in a day, it   generally commences in a neglect of duty  Many both in and out of the Church find fault  with Prest Young, and say that he tyranizes over the   people, but he has known him fir many years, both   in public and private, and no one, whom he ever knew  had so few failings as Brigham Young, but    He had been a great benefactor to the poor, whom   he had brought from their poverty in the old country   and placed them in comfortable circumstances in   these vallies. We as a people must keep   the commandments of God if we expect to be saints -   we must try to overcome our taste for Tea, Coffee,  Tobacco, Whiskey &c it was a warfare, and will   be, as long as we live, but the truth that leads to   eternal life is a narrow one. 
 nought, hav being about to fill up the measure   of their iniquity—we do not know what   the Lord wants to do with us, but we must take   it patiently, and whatever the Lord says through   his servant Brigham, we will do.    He had been baptized for all his friends, and   was ready to go behind the vail any time the   Lord wanted him—but Zion will prosper   and be built up, every latter day Saint should   live to build it as far as they have strength   and ability. He then prophesied the speedy   destruction of this Nation, and the establishment   if the Kingdom of God— 
 our future condition and exaltation, certainly   depends on the course we pursue here.    We are the best people on the earth, and he had   no doubt but we were trying to improve our   lives.    He did not believe, the wicked will ever   disturb us from our homes — if we will only   do right, and prize our priveleges.    He knew this was the Gospel, and these are the   people of God, and we have the ordinances  but if Zion needs cleansing, God will cleanse her.   He prayed that God would prepare us for whatever   is coming — to be true and faithful & c 
 On Saturday May 14th 1870  Theological Class met at the Tabernacle  at One o clock pm    Present Prest Geo. A. Smith presiding  After singing Prayer by Elder S. W. Richards Singing  Elder A P. Rockwood recommended a systematic   organized effort being made to destroy the Grasshoppers  unless it is done, he was satisfied there will be but   little raised this season.    Elder W. W. Woodruff  said the best plan he had found   to destroy them was to get a large sheet, and a   man at each corner to drag it through the   grain, and when caught & bury them—it   certainly was their duty to make an organized   effort, and if after that is done, and the   Crops are destroyed, we shall have the satisfaction   of having done our duty. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff reported that a considerable   effort had been made during the week by Bro  Turnbow and those who had turned out to assist   him, in the destruction of the Grasshoppers, and   hoped that a union of Gra exertion will be   continue to be made that our wheat may be   spared 
 Elder W. Woodruff had a pleasant journey up north—  the leading Council given, was ^for^ the Saints to lay   up their grain—had they heeded it before, the   Grasshoppers would not have visited us    Woollen and other Factorys were also recommended   for the saints to build    Zion is increasing—We shall soon have a   Mighty host in these vallies—Parents should   teach their children the Gospel of Christ    He hoped the Saints would magnify their callings   and build up the Kingdom of God    He would like to have them build one Temple  in these vallies—hundreds had got to be built.    If we did our duty, we shall never be driven   away from these vallies    When the time comes, for the Saints to go back to   build up Zion in Jackson County—that these vallies   will not be vacated entirely, neither will all   return to that Country. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff refered to the many  priveleges that latter day Saints enjoy, was  glad many were waking up to the subject  of Baptism for the dead—He had been  baptized and sealed to all his progenitors  that he could find out—He then made  comparisons between the beautify and glory  of our religion, and the nonsense of  what the world called  religion—    When we pray, we pray to a being who has  a Head, a Heart, and a perfect organization—  people apostatize, because they dont keep the  commandments of God, they dont study the  scriptures,— what is not yet revealed   will be, a little at a while until we shall  receive all ^that^ is essential for our perfection &c 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff  said we are all here by Faith  Utah would never have been inhabited without faith    Joseph Smith brought forth the book of Mormon  through faith—He himself, had been sustained  And done what he had done since he embraced  the Gospel, by Faith—He was one who went  up in Missouri to fight the state, to redeem Zion  by Faith 
 All our works had been performed by faith    He had faith that our enemies would be stirred  up to fight against us—but Salvation, such that  is promised unto us should stimulate us to exercise  faith and our works should correspond to do what  God required of us—Some had not faith  enough to retain their standing in the church, they had  gradually given way to temptation and given way  to overt acts until the Spirit of the Lord was entirely  withdrawn from them.    God was going to build up Zion in spite of Earth  or Hell—A man who has received the Holy  Ghost had the Apostleship &c and then fall  away, had far better have had a Millstone co  put around his neck and cast into the sea    He did not want to live one hour only  while he continued in the faith    Let our wants be known before the Lord, and pray  for our friends and enemies also.    We will ^have^ plenty of new principles as fast as we  can appreciate and live up to them 
 Elder W. Woodruff commented severely   on the wilful practise of Herd boys destroying   fences, and damaging the late crops,  And shewed the necessity of enter^ing^ into all our   operations, the principle of cooperation.^The importation of Bees and Fish^ 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said, he alone was responsible   for what was said about Bp Gardners ward party,   he was not present himself, but from reports that   reached him, he had stated last saturday what   he did, was pleased with Bp Gardners statement,   realized the difficulties that B'ps labour under,   especially in the management of parties, where   licquor happens to get in, if only by a few   He hoped Bp Gardner would be blest in controuling   his ward he entertained a high regard for him 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we had been in school a   good while, and ^he^ believed we were approaching a  very great and important crisis as a people   he also believed, we were improving and ad-  vancing. The Angel told Joseph what would  become of cerain nations, quoted many passages   of ancient scriptures, and taught him their appli  cation, by this means he was t instructed and   taught from a pure and correct fountain.  the spirit of revelation grew up in him until   he became throughly acquainted with it.  The same spirit dwelt in Bro Brigham   and ^had^ been growing in him for many years  we want to learn God and the spirit of God  as well as the sciences, for there are many   great philosophers well versed in the sciences   are not only ignorant of God, but are infidel  in their principles. Let any one read the Pro-  phecies in Isaih, Book of Mormon, Doctrine &   Covenants with a prayerful spirit, and we can   almost write the future of many nations.    He spoke of the diversity of gifts and qualifica  tions, some quick to discern one thing, and some   another. There was a necessity for each one   to learn the voice of the Spirit, mentioning two   cases ^of^ self preservation in is own experience   by listening to and obeying the whisperings   of the spirit. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said in behalf of the parent associ  ation, for the introduction of Improved Stock, Bees,   Swine, Sheep &c &c, while they were calling ^upon^ other   counties to cooperativee with them in establishing   branch associations—it was very necessary   for us in Salt Lake County to start in a   cooperative effort to herd our stock so as   to have the ranch cleared of all that is now   running loose—have a regular system   on an upright principle that every one   may have their rights—there as been a great   amount of dishonesty practised by individuals   who have undertaken to take stock & sheep on   shares, and we want to do away with this. 
 (3) Jan 14, 18701  W. Woodruff. continued adverted to the hand   of God in our present peace and quiet we enjoy   in this City, notwithstanding the hue and cry of our   bitter enemies, in the set time of the almighty   Not only this Nation, but other Nations that   lift their hands against this work   will be broken to pieces and come to   nought. Prayed that we might all   become more acquainted with the spirit   of God, understand his purposes, and   be prepared for the great things that   are coming to pass. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said these important   subjects, require our wisdom, patience and   perseverance—He spoke of Father Russell   ship builder, who before embracing the Gospel  had his Life & Ships Insured, but after that,   drew his interest out, and paid his Insurance   money into the church, and trusted in God to   take care of his life and property.    He also explained some particulars about   starting the Co operative Herd    Spoke of the opposition we have had to   contend with from the Government Officials   who have tried to bring us into bondage & trouble—  but have signally failed, God has heard   the prayers of the faithful and delivered us   out of the hands of the wicked—he feels   that God will continue to break every weapon   that is formed against us—our enemies are   very short lived, God has cut them off—  and will do so, & build up Zion.    let us therefore combine and cooperate together   and have integrity and shew that are in every   worthy of the confidence of both God and man 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we ought to rejoice in the   privelege of living in a day when we can assist in   building a Temple to the name of the most high  no one since the days of Solomon has had such a   privelege—many efforts have been made to destroy   us in this generation, but the hand of God has been   outstretched towards us and delivered us from the   hands of our enemies 
 We are abundantly able to do what is required of   us if we are only willing.    He felt anxious to respond to the call made   last Saturday for funds to emigrate the poor  but having no ready means on hand was the only   cause he did not.    He would give 1,000 lbs Flour to help feed   the hands that work on the Temple    It was quite a privelege to help build up the Kingdom   of God—We cannot take behind the vail   any of our property with us, but we can take with   us, those blessings that have been put on our   heads by the servants of God, if we will only live   for them. 
 Elder W. Woodruff, spoke on the same subject ^of sustaining home manufactory;^  Shall we sustain our own machinery and   manufactories, or shall we neglect it  we ought to study the interests of Zion, if   we dont study its interests, we had better g leave   and go to California—we had better   Cooperate in everything that will build   up Zion—we  have the power to build   a Temple and occupy it—a privelege   which the ancient apostles never had—  We are building a Zion here, though Earth   & Hell are opposing us—whatever   council is given us, let us carry it out. 
 Elder W. Woodruff warned the school against telling out   of this house what is spoken here, but keep sacred the covenants  we have made 
 Elder W. Woodruff, said the secret of the present   antagonism about Polygamy, was simply, because   it was a command of God, and Lucifer was opposed   to it. He did not believe in abandoning one principle   of the Gospel to please this Nation or any other.   We can afford to risk the issue and consequences   of the present persecution—the controversary   is between God and the Nation.    Let us remember to keep the commandments  of God, to attend to our prayers and duties   and God will deliver us—We shall certainly   come off much better, by cleaving to our religion   than by bartering any portion of it away for the sake   of a state government—Let us unite our prayers  together. 
 Elder W. Woodruff strongly recommended the   Elders of Israel to keep a Journal of the dealings   of God with them—the Prophet Joseph used   to urge this upon the Elders—k Bro Woodruff said   heco Kept a record of every sermon that he heard Joseph   preach—He wished that a more correct account   had been Kept of the early doings of the early Elders   of the church, and the dealings of God with his   people—he has never neglected one day without   writing something in his diary    In regard to the spirit of Prophecy, we are apt to look   two high, and except too much in the wrong direction—  the still small voice of the spirit was what we should   seek after and cultivate—the church in its infancy   When a man was called to go on a mission, the Lord 
 had to be enquired of, and obtain from Him a revelation  but now Prest. Young living in the light of revelation  hundreds are called to go on a mission and have   to start in a few hours—the Church has grown, and  we are continually led by the spirit of revelation—  We have much to be grateful for, the Kingdom   is onward and upward—He then related several   forewarnings of danger ^by the spirit of God^ which he always listened   to and acted upon, and himself, family & friends   saved from sudden destruction 
 Elder W. Woodruff spoke of ^the^ immutability of the word  of God—he could see the s hand of God as he   leads and guides the destinys of this people.    a dark cloud had been over us, for some months   past—and yet, the spirit of calmness & composure  has rested upon his Servants—let us do right, have   faith in God, and nothing can checque this onward   course of this church—during the past 40 years  the Lord has been giving us an experience, and pre-  paring us to accomplish his purposes.    all that fight against Zion will certainly ^be^ put to   shame and confusion, as past experience proves.    If its the will of the Lord to give us a State Govern  ment, we shall certainly have less to do with the   Government, than we have now in a Territorial capa  city, then, we can elect our own Governor, Judges &c   whereas now, those officers are forced upon us   without our consent. 
 Elder W. Woodruff hoped to live long enough   to see pleasant Ephraim enjoy all the blessings,  that were long since, enjoyed by their forefathers    he then spoke of the Elders of Israel who held the   destinies of the Nations in their hands, and the   necessity of them living worthy of their high and   holy calling. He then related a dream   that he had while on a Mission to in England    pertaining to the Lamanites. he saw a beautiful   Temple rerected on the mountains of Israel, he   went in, and while there, a large number of Laman-  ites came in and seated themselves in a place  by themselves, by and bye, they began to work,  and they seemed to accomplish more in two hours   than others could do in a day, but a strict   account was kept of ^all^ the labour that was performed   by every one in that house. and they appeared   to have been inspired by some prophet to enter   that Temple, and enter upon those blessings promised   by their forefathers. 
 the acts of the wicked will fall upon their own head,   and the righteous will be delivered—it is our   privelege to ask the Lord for a State Government,   and if its his will, he will grant it, by raising up   friends to urge our petition through both Houses of   Congress—do not forget our prayers, nor fail in any   of our duties and God will establish Zion in these   Mountains. 
 Elder W. Woodruff spoke with gratitude to God, for the prospect   of a bountiful Harvest. He wa had also commenced to   favour Zion, to build it up, gather the poor, would bless   the leaders of Iassrael with the light of revelation  and,  &c 
 We are a branch of Ephraim, and received the   Gospel first. and should treat the poor   degraded Indian with Kindness, for they fell  through unbelief, we should also be anxious to   build this Temple here, and that in St George.  He then spoke of the persecution that was pressing   upon us by the heads of this nation, by unlawfully   keeping in bondage, our Brethren. as Latter   day Saints, we should seek the blessing of God   of upon the saints, and his displeasure upon his   enemies. The Leaders of this people have stood   the test, and been proved for many years hence,   we should hold up their hands, and exercise   faith for them, these honours and labours that   God has put upon our brethren, should stimulate   us follow in their footsteps. a faithful  humble follower of Jesus Christ, is in a far more   exalted position, than can be confer'd upon men   by the world. Let us be faithful to God and   each other, and endure to the end, that we may   be saved for Jesus sake. Amen.

 Salt Lake City  Great Bason  North America    Oct 7th 1848    Dear Br & Sister Woodruff  with pleasure I set me down this morning in  great hast to address you a few lines from  which Leaves us all in good health Except myself  I have had a short addttacts of the mountion fevar  cussed by exposier on my Journey to sweet water  & back where I met the companies the 26 day of Sept ^August^  I was also much Exposed to cold in the Salt Lake  Since my returne.  Mrs Smoots gener^a^l health  is much the same it was in winter quarters    Father Woodruffs health is some better at this  time than it has been since he has been in the valy  Yet he feels dizcuraged in meny things & often  wishes himself back to the East where he could  have some comforts the remander of his days    BJames Bevin who you Left in charge of your  Buness has actterd Eevery thing but the part of  a Gentleman with the old man.  The wolves Eat  the mans corn Last winter by neglect of hurding her  regular which I was unable to have attended to myself  haveing a house to build & other buness that  I was  a blessed to attend to.  Your oter Bevin had two good  Cows in his charge that he took out on the farme  & milked & Left the father Woodruff perfectly destitute  of milk & Butter only as Iwe furnished him 
 I repeatedly requestied him to Let the old man have a   a cow but he refused as often. I then complaned of him  before the council & their compelle ^him^ to let the old  man have a cow. With my assistence Father Woodruff  Saved Last fall 3 acres of wheat & 2 1/2 of rye, but  it all didnot Yeald him 12 bushels of grain which   has bredid them up to this time & some 2 or 3 bushels   Left for Seed a po[r]tion of which Bevin clames  he also ^clames^ one half or 2 thirds of the corn crop for which  he has commenced a Suit, if he obtaines it it will Leave  the old man vary Scant of breadstuff. Bevin says he  has nothing more to do with you only to retain posses  ion of one of those roomes you built untill he  gits his pay for the building of them. That deprives  Br Benbow of going into Eather of them. Consequen  tely he refuses to take charge of your goods & they Lye  Just as they did the Last year Exposed to the murcy of  whom soever Bevin is disposed to quarter their in    he however tells brother Benbow that he may come ^the room^ in  with him in according to your request in the Letter  you wrote to him. Br Benbow says their was no such  understandings between you & him. & he willnot submit  to Live in a room with Eny Man I dont know yet what  disposition will be made of your good.

 Great Salt Lake City Oct. 16, 1849    Elder Wilford Woodruff    Beloved Brother    We received lengthy communications, scraps and Papers from you,  by the last mail, which we have scarce had time to read, in full; business  has pressed so heavily upon us, but we understand your situation, and will  make all the communication at this time, that the nature of the case will admit.    Our mail is closed, and about ready to start. Our  General Epistle is in Type, by which you will learn General news, and we  shall send this, and many more communications by Express, to overtake the  mail in the mountains. Your friends are well, and the People generally,  and we would all be glad to see you here with your family.    Gather up all the Saints in the East, this Winter, and  make ready, and in the Spring come with them, and you will see great  improvements have taken place since you left home. Tell the brethren of  Capital to bring means to establish factories.    Say to the brothers Livingston, at Peterboro, that next  year there will be wool enough raised in the Valley, to supply a  considerable factory, that the cloth is needed here, that here is the place  for building Zion, that here is a better place to manufacture and make  money than any other place: and persuade one or all, and all such  to remove with delay to this place. Next Season we design a  settlement over the rim of the Basin on the South, where cotton,  rice and sugar cane will flourish, and from whence we can get  our supplies: but even at present, it would be far better to transport  the raw cotton from the States and have it manufactured here,  than to bring the cloth, for there are good water privileges in abundance,  and experienced workmen on hand. therefore start out a company  both for cotton and woollen manufacturing, this Winter ready for  spring's emigration with machinery, &c, and every facility will be  granted them in this place, which possible can be. 
 Also we want some Iron founders. There is coal and Iron  not far distant in good locations, and moulders in the Valley, therefore  do not fail to bring us a founder, for castings of all descriptions are  much needed, and there is no location in the States so good as this  for the business.    There is no class of mechanics or manufactures but can do   well here, for we are in the centre of Creation, and in need of many  things except Gold, but should we tell you all we have seen and  handled you could scarce believe.    In the short space of about one  month we have received by voluntary donation over 5,500 dollars  for a perpetual emigrating fund, and sent Bishop Hunter, to the States   to gather up the Poor. Further particulars you will glean from our  Epistle, and our letters to brother Hyde, a copy of which you will  doubtless see. You are an agent to solicit and receive donations for  said fund: any means you can gather and forward to Bishop Hunter  at Kanesville early in the Spring will be immediately applied, to  its destined object.    Find brother Benjamin S. Wilber of New York and bring   him on with all his goods. We also want brother Jesse C. Little to settle  up his affairs and come to this place. This is the place for business,  for increasing and doing good.    Come with the Saints, Master Workmen, machinery, with your  Gold, (not Silver 'tis too heavy) and all precious things, and when you arrive,  we shall have so much to tell you what we cannot write, you  will be ready to declare "a half has not been told me," Yes Bro Woodruff  stretch out your arms like a man of God, and gather up and bring  a host to Zion.    With our best wishes and blessings on yourself and family and  all the faithful. We remain your brethren in Christ.    Brigham Young  Heber C. Kimball  Willard Richards 
 P.S. Agreeably to your last letter, brother Richards expects you have  accomplished your mission with brother Russel, and that the transfer  has been completed long before this.    WR

I suppose some of my goods have  been consederably damaged by getting  wet.

 Washington City Dec. 14, 1849    Dear Brother,    I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt  of your letters ^dated^ at Bordentown & New York, as well as three  letters from your friend Mr Carter to member of Congress.  The petition for a territorial government to which the signa-  tures are affixed will not be presented to Congress, but  the memorial accompanying the Constitution which asks  for our admission as a state, or for such other form of  government as Congress may grant us—I had a long  and pleasant interview with jude Douglass the other  evening, and his advice was to apply for admission  as a state or for a territorial government, and leave  the alternative with Congress which to give us, he said  this would show our readiness to defray the expenses  of a state government, and our willingness to accept  a territorial government, that this course would be manly  and honorable—From the intercourse I have had  with members of Congress, I am pretty well satisfied  that we shall not get anything more than a territorial  government, in this event I shall do all I can to have  President Young appointed governor, and such other  officers as will be acceptable to the people—Ten  days have now been spent by the House in unavail-  ing attempts to elect a Speaker—The excitement and  confusion in the House yesterday & the day before  were at times very great.

 New York Octobr 18 1849    Dear Brother,    On my arrival here I found a letter  from the Presidentcy of the Church, informing me  that a constitution had been formed, and a state  government organized in the valley, and instruct-  ing me to apply to Congress at its approaching  session for the admission of Deseret into the  Union on the same footing as the original states—  I am also desired not to deliver my letter to  Col Kane, therefore I shall consider myself  under particular obligations to you if you  will have the goodness to favor me with a  letter of introduction to Col Kane, saying  that any assitance he may render me in  my the proposed application to Congress  will gratefully acknowledged &c    Be pleased to direct to the City of New York,  if I should not be here your letter will be  forward to me—My respects to sister Woodruff—    Yours Truly  J.

Y. a liar which was followed by a scene  that may be more easily imagined than described.  The report this morning is that Mead will challenge Duer  to mortal combat, and in the event of his declining,  which Madam Vernons says he will, then he (Mead)  will attack him in the street or wherever he may meet  him—This will be an exciting and stormy session,  and if there be not some duels fought I shall be  disappointed—The Lord has indeed and in truth  come out of his hiding place to vex this nation—  I avail myself of the accosion to tender to sister Woodruff  my kind regards, and to renew to you ^assurances of^ my high  respect and esteem—    John M. Bernhisel    P. S. I have presented a specimen of salt from the Great  Salt Lake and a copy of the Book of Mormon to the  Library of Congress, which were gladly receeived,  and the Salt was placed along side of some which  was brought by Leut. Lynch from the Dead Sea or Salt   Sea, and said to be part of Lot's wife—I avail myself  of every proper accasion to preach the Gospel to   members of Congress and other distinguished per-  sonages—Brother Babbitt and I get along pretty well.

 [sideways text] Elder Orson Spencer  Jany. 18 1848 [end of sideways text]    Liverpool Jan. 18, 1848    Dear Pres. Wilford Woodruff    Having learnt by a Letter  received yesterday from Pres. Brigham Young dated Nov.  25th that you with the greater part of your Quorum had  returned to Winter Quarters, I resolved to Seize, (not  a favorable moment for writing to you,) but rather  a forced capture of some fleeting moments to fulfill  my promise & delight in the matter. It cheers my heart  to learn that you have become sound enough to  make a visit of two thousand miles over the mountains  in one season in company with so many of your  beloved Quorum. All in health & increased strength  I say to glory to God for this glorious & successful but  arduous expedition of the Latter Day Liberators!  This expedition will constitute a new epoch in the  annals of the everlasting kingdom, that will be  conspicuous for worlds to come for the energy  enterprize & indefatigable endurance of the performance  The results of this expedition are endlessly by praiseworthy  and glorious. I shall now venture to tell the British  Saints and the Nations of Europe that Zion is established  That their eye may look upon her that is to be the  joy of the whole earth & and an eternal excellency."  Beautiful for Situation is that place. The mountains  are round about the fat valley of the great basin 
 as a munition of Rocks. The splendid intelligence of   the millennial Era is requisite in order to appreciate  the worth of the labors of the first founded of the kingdom  of Latter day glory. I shall boldly declare that a  resting place for the laboring & heavy laden of all  Nations is now prepared. I can now answer the  moanful cry of the emigrant that has often been  reiterated in my ears in this land; "When may  we emigrate? I have long been out of business  and expending my means, when can I emigrate?  Now I have the happiness through your toils and  memorable discovery & liberal permission to announce  the welcome day. I do not regret having come to  England on this important mission, neither shall  I regret an invitation to return when it comes from  your dear & honored Quorum. The past year has  been one of great prosperity as to the enlargement  of the Church in this Island & the increase of faith and  diligence & zeal in the work of the Lord. Many thousands  have been added to the Church & peace & union  have pervaded all parts of the Kingdom of Christ   on this Island. In Wales there has been added  to the Church about one hundred & fifty a month  for five or six months past. In nearly all places  the work moves forward with the most delightful  impulse. All feel strong & ardent for the increase  of the Saved. What will be the effect of Emigration  upon the future impulse & progress of the work is 
 yet problematical. American Elders will become   scarce after three more leave the Island. A few recruits  would not come amiss. Agreeable to my instructions  from counselcil I shall open the channels of emigration  with all possible diligence. The Emigrants will almost  unavoidably stop at different places. Some are  anxious to go, if they can reach no further than St Louis  or even New Orleans & I am glad that the Council  saw fit to appoint an agent to look after them at these  places. I need not inform you that it will be very  necessary. I have increased the number of our Paper  during the year about 5 or six hundred. The present  numbers now issued at the commencement of the  Two first no's of the tenth volume are about 32,000  I have printed nearly 200,000 small Tracts or  "Invitations" and more than 150,000 pages of larger  Tracts which are spread abroad among the people  aiming thereby to warn & invite all the inhabitanits  of this Island as far as practicable. The Saints are  almost enthusiastic in preaching & warning  the people in every possible way. The new Edition  of the Hymn Book is nearly all sold. A small  new Edition of the Book of Mormon is also just printed.  I have also just printed a Small volume mostly  of Letters in continuation of a reply to Rev. Wm Crowil  Boston Mass. U. S. A. which received a ready demand  I have purchased a Phonatic Font of 329 pounds  wright for the Council according to request, and shall 
 Send ^it^ by Bro Wheelock Soon; having no chance to  Send it Sooner safely. I shall also purchase a  good microscope to send at the same time. I have  addressed three Letters to Pres. Young since I have  been here, one of them was Superscribed to Pres.  Young or Pres. Hyde. I have in the absence of  Pres. Young (over the mountain) written to Eld.  Orson Hyde on the business of the Church, supposing  him to be the proper authority to counsel me.    I am fully ready to return home or to remain or  go elsewhere hopeing thereby to secure the confidence  of the "Twelve" whom I ever desire to obey in the Lord  as it is meet. The friendly hint given me by Pres.  Young when he appointed me to this mission and lately  repeated & formerly seconded by Bro Pratt, viz not  to walk in the steps of my defaulting predecessors in office  almost inclined me to look over my geography to  see in what part of the world it is that they poke one  horse because another horse is unruly. My heart is   sometimes melted like wax to think of my desolate and  now sick little children & I could return to them with  joy if so counselled. But I am blessed so far with   the faith & support of all Israel & hope ever to merit the  same by well doing. Crime & distress are awful  in this land and the evils increase rather than disminish.  The power of the endowment is mightily visible in Europe  if not in America. My playful allusion to the hint to  Pres. Young is, done with the utmost kindness & respect  for his motives & the wisdom of the hint. Remember me  in the praying circle for I never felt my need of wisdom  more. Give my love to your wife & Pres Young & I want to say more  but business hurries & my sheet is full.    Orson Spencer

Last thursday sister's Pratt, Hyde,  Taylor Kimball Benson Hooper & Smith made me a visit, (sister  Young being quite sick she could not come,) the most of them  brought their letters and read them and we had a very pleasent  time. Sister Smith's letter was read first which gave the infor-  mation of Br. Pratt's addition to himself. I think there was some  jokes passed and prophecyes, delivered upon the occasion, however it was 
 nothing unexpected to her as she said they had decided upon it  before he went away that is if he saw any one that would answer  the purpose that he wished, he then wrote her that he had found  one she said that he had been trying a number of months ^to find someone.^    I soon sent to the office when I had time and received your  package and distributed them according to the directions I am  glad to have you write to them ^the children^ as they have often told me that  you cared nothing about them but to scold them, they were much  pleased with their letters I thought them very good and they all  want to write you Moroni not excepted he was much pleased  and wants the children to write you for him but Bula thinks  she can write write and dictate herself, so she has written some.  Moroni does about as well as can be expected but he requires a  tight reign kept. I thought I would not say any thing about  my family cares to you to distrub your felicity but you asked  me to tell you how the children Emma & Sarah got along. I  think the children & Emma get along very well in school  Willford has not been able to study much for sometime on  account of his eyes I have got him a new pair of boots and paid  $3.50 cts for them. E s^t^ays with me most of the time but the children  do much better without her than with her as she waits for them &  they for her so the work is principally left for me also she stirs  them up to make a noise and theirs is much jargon between  her and Susan which frets father much she inclines to  stay here all the time she makes me much more trouble than she 
 G. S. L. Citty Dec 28 [18]55    My Dear Willford    With pleasure I acknowlege  the reception of your general epistle from the hand of  br Pugh which was well written and a rich treasure  well distributed to the family and they duly appreciated  it Your letters have quite an effect upon the children  and family. I am very glad to hear from you often    I forgot to tell you that we get but one number  of the news—I thought perhaps you had one number  sent to you. We are all well. The measles are about  and I am afraid that Bula will get them.    We have sent a large package of letters to you  by Br Haywood with which I think you will be  amused and Phebe has just received one by mail  in answer to one she wrote on the windowseat in the dusk   I knew nothing she wrote, she says she will do better next  time. The weather for 3 days past has been very cold but today  is mild. Br Haywood expected to have gone 2 day before this  but he expects to start in the morn. I have just writen  this to say that we have received I think all your letters    So good by my love good by    Phebe W. Woodruff    I think if you had as much confusion about you  as I think you have it would be perplexing to you 
 does me good but she thinks she thinks she does well. If the  children were alone I could say to them you must and you  must not but with her I must be very careful to not give   offence—she was quite offended to think that you told Sarah  that her education and principles were establish she said she  should tell you that it was a fine thing that one of the family  was established—baulderdash has showed itself a number  of times there by her but I have as yet kept my foot on it.  Sarah has had a cold but has got over it and is as cross  as is possible she has got a web in the loom of about 20 yds.  she has been 2 weeks about it and I think if she keeps on she  will get it out by spring. Miss Bula is so turbulent themat  I am obliged to take a stick to her sometimes, taking all  things here together I have all that I can get along with  I think S. & E. will write you. I am thinking of takeing  the children to the ward party ^on christmas^ to please them but myself would  much rather stay at home I suppose you will have fine times  with you on Christmas & New years well I hope you will  enjoy yourself while you can. I feel that the cares and  troubles of this life are many but time rolls rapidly and  I am glad of it. Susan has teased a long time to let her ask  you one question at last I gave her permission so she has  dictated all herself. 25th Br. Haywood has kindly sent me word  this morn that he will take letters or any small package to you I dont think  of any thing save these letters and Phelps bill that you will need before you  come home. 
 Phebe W. Woodruff  Dec 28th 
 Wenll Christmas is passed and the weather was very cold. I had Emma  Sarah David and James Jackson to dine with me James spent  the day here. I wish you could have been here unless you was better  provided for, but any way we would like to see you home. I hope  you will not be sick while away as you spoke of not haveing an  appetite. Last rvr the children E. and myself went to the ward party  and had a very pleasant time—wish you could have been there, very  many went to the Hall. I find myself very comfortably situ provided  for this winter I think I should enjoy it much better if the one who  provided it could partake with us but I shall try to save something  against you come with your new bride, for from a dream that I had  on the night of the 20th about you you had or was about to get one—then  you spoke of the &c. The man that spoke to you about threshing the  wheat called to do it but I told him he must wait untill you come  home. My children are as kind and good to me as children could  possibly be with the exception of Susans & Bula's freakes they have all  taken turns with me in family prayr ever since you left Emma  wanted to be excused but I told her she could not if she staid  with me. The children have all dictated their own letter as you will  perceive I have not read one of them yet. I have much work to  do yet but hope you will leave your hurry at Fillmore    We ask the blessings of God to rest upon you morn. & eve.    I remain yours truly  Phebe W. Woodruff    My kind love to bother & sister Holbrook    [upside-down text] Please accept a kiss from Phebe [end of upside-down text]

 Brother W. Woo^d^ruff.    Sir, your Letter of the 9th of March, dire-  cted to Bishop Partridge, Presidents Joseph Smith Jr, Sidney  Rigdon, ^and^ Hyram Smith, and the Saints in Zion, came safely to  them, some day's since. aAnd on account of the press of business  now on their hands, ^and the request of J Smi◊th Jr,^ I have taken it upon me to answer it.  You say, that you have heard of the deplorable state of things in  Kirtland; and it gave me much Joy to learn by your letter, that  you viewed those things in their true light. Great has been the  afflictions of the saints in that place, particularly our beloved  Brotheren Joseph Smith Jr, and S. Rigdon.    In the past  summer; I Journeyed from this place in company with Wm  Smith, and D. W. Patten, to Kirtland, for the purpose of  meeting in conference those with the 12 ^twelve^. On our arrival,  we soon learned the difeculties that then existed than: these  however wase all appearantly settled, preveious by to my leaving  Kirtland: And ^W^ Parish, who has since become  so [3 illegible words] ^an unbeliever in the book^  ^of Mormon, reveiled religion, [illegible],^ affected to repent and become sattisfied, with Br. Joseph  and the Church. oOthers also did the same: But this settlement  was not of long duration. Soon after this, President Hyram  Smith and I, left Kirtland for the upper Missouri: and  President Joseph Smith, President S. Rigdon, and ^Prest.^ Wm  Smith, soon followed us to Far West: and during their  absence, it seemes that ^Wr^ Parish, J. F Bointon, Luke  Johnson, Joseph Coe, and some others, [illegible] ^united^ togeather in  for the [2 illegible words] ^repecting the procedings^ of the Church. President Smith and  his company returned on or about the 10th of December;  soon after which this [2 illegible words] ^decenting^ band, openly, and publickly,  renounced the Church of Christ of Latterday Saints, and claimed,  themselves to be the old standard, called themslves the Church  of Christ, excluded that of saints, and set at naught Br  Joseph and the whole Church, denounceing them as Heriticks 
 How blind and infatuated are the minds of men, when once turned from  Rigteousness to wickedness? They did not understand, that by taking  upon them the name of Latter day Saints, did not do away that of the  Church of Christ. Neither did they consider, that the ancient church,  was the Church of Christ, and that they were Saints. And again,  it appears that they did not consider the Prophesy, of Daniel, which  saith; ^says^ "The saints shall take the Kingom" &c "Again, "the Kingdom, and  the greatness of the Kingdom, under the whole Heaven, was given to  the people, (the Saints) of the most High" &c And the Saints  here alluded to, were certainly Latterday Saints; was much, as the  above prophesy is to be fulfilled, in the Last days; and is yet  future, as all professed readers of the bible will confess.    We have of late learned, that pParish, and the most [rest] of this [2 illegible words], ^combination^  have openly renounced the Book of Mormon, and becme deists.  I will now Leave Kirtland, and give you some acount of the move-  ment of things here, as they are and have been.    You, undoubtedly, will remember the visit, which I, in company with  Elder Groves, made to the Churches in Kentucky and Tennessee, in  the summer of 1836. You also may reecollect, the nature and  result, of our visit. We came to solisit assistance, for Poor  bleeding Zion: And we obtained, through the goodnes of the  Children of God, in those regeons, the sum of fourteen hundred  and fifty dollars, which we delivered unto Wm Phelps & John  Whitmer, on our arrival to this place. But these men, instead  of laying out the money for the benefit of Poor bleeding  Zion, purchased Land for their own emolument. They g^e^nerally  did their business, independantly of the aid, or council of ^either^ the bishop  or High Council. This gave some uneasiness to the 2 ^two^ author-  ities of Zion: not only because they purchased land With  Church funds, in their own name, for their own agrandisement,  but because they selected the place of the City Far West  and appointed the spot for the House of the Lord to be  built on, drew the plan of said house, and appointed and  ordained a committee to build the same, without  asking or seeking council at the hand of either Bishop,  High Council, or first presidency; when it was well under-  stood that these authorities wer ^appointed^ for the purpose of coun-  ciling on all important matters pertaining to the saints of  God.    These two presidents also managed to get the town plott  into their own hands, that they that they might reap the avails  ariseing from the sale of the lots. In consequence of these, with  many other things, the Council met by themselves on the 3rd day of  April 1837, and resolved to invite the two presidents, the Bishop  and his council, and the two apostles, namely T. B. Marsh and D. W.  Pattatten, to meet with them, on the 5th inst. to which time they  adjourned. Acordingly the above named authorities met, on the

We have made an excedg [exceeding]  good voyage considering the time of the year & weather, the  Steam Ship Liverpool left New York 5 days before the Oxford  & yet we reachd the dock at Liverpool about 10 minutes before  her & about 30 minutes before the Indipendance that left N.Y.  10 days before us the Oxford, Liverpool, & Indipendance, all reachd  Liverpool at the same hour. We had rough weather the foore  part of the voyage sone of the tine it blew a gale but it was  quite plesant the latter part of the time We were becalned  4 days. we were a little Sea Sick the first few days but  very healthy since I think our Sea voyage has done us  all good for we are all quite harty & healthy. We were 20  days out of sight of land. We had 107 souls on board composed of  Anercans [Americans], English, Scotch, Irish, Weltch, Dutch, &c. We took  Stearage pasage fare $15. dollars, We were quite crowded but the  weather was quite comfortable I was quite pleased to once more  walk on land esspecially to tread the Soil of Old Englad I have  been quite pleased with Liverpool what little I have seen  of it excepting the Smoke which is quite Dense We have just 
 visited the Liverpool New Market which is exceding splended. We  shall take the cars for Preston on Mondy we cannot pass the  Custom house officers untill that tine our trunks are still  on boord the Oxford where they must be examined on Mondy  I have just written a Letter to Ilus Carter & one to PP P^r^att  both of New York City The reason of my writig to you  & other friends this evenig is because a packet Ship Sails  tomorrow morning for New York by which I shall send my  letters As it happens it appears that Elder Taylor & myself  were the first of our quorum that left Commerce to perform  this journey & the first that arivd in Englad. but I expet sone  of the rest will soon follow us Elder P.P. Pratt said when  we left him we might look for him soon. I can  not tell you anything about the Saints in this country for  you see I have not had time as yet to see them or  hear any thing about them. phebe dont fail to write to  me often I want to hear from you much as I have  ownly had one letter from you since I left Montrose  remember to Direct to Preston, Lancashire, England I will  pay the postage on all my letters to New York & then they will  pass safe both ways & if you will do the same I shall obtain  yours, please inform me of the dates of all letters you  recieve from me (I have sent you some little money & ♢  wish to know if you have recievd it)   
 give me all the news you have when you write  I shall write to you again after I visit the Church  & get to work about my Master business which I am  determined shall not be long. Give my respects  to all who inquire I wish to share an interest in  your prayers & the prayers of all Saints for we  need them for wickedness reigns. I hope you will  excuse my short epistle & haste in writing at this time  for my main object at this time was merely to  inform you of our arival in England    That health, temperance, truth, wisdom the [page torn]  of God may rest upon us, & health contentment per [page torn]  & the blessing of heaven may rest upon you & all Saints  is the prayer if your Friend & Companion  Phebe.

 Jan" 29th 1840. At Alfred Cordon's, Club buildings, Navigation road, Burslem, Staffordshire, England.    My Dear Phebe    While seated in a foreign land I once more take up my pen to fill a sheet for your perusal  May grace, mercy, faith, peace, health, strength, & patience & resignation, rest upon you from GOD our Father & our LORD  JESUS CHRIST. I have chosen a large sheet because I have much I wish to say unto you. I sent you a letter  when I first arived in Liverpool but had not time to write but few words but merly designed you to know of my arival  But knowing that you feel interested in my mission. I will coppy from my journal in this letter an account of my  voyage & travels since I left New York to the present time, & then make such other remarks as I may have room. Dec 18th, 1839  in New York. I laboured hard all day to prepare for sailing. Three of us went on board (with our Baggage) of the Oxford a regular  packet ship of the New York & Liverpool line. viz Elders Taylor, Turley & myself, we slept on board. 19th The Oxford left the dock &  moved out into the stream. 20th At 12 oclock she spread her canvass & set sail, was assisted a few miles by a steam Boat.  She had on board 15 cabin & 64 steerage passengers & Capt John Rathbone, 1st Mate Yates, 2nd mate Jones, one carpenter & 26 sailors, making  109 souls in all. Cabin fare $1.40 dollars steerage $15. Fair wind & sail well. 21st stift breeze & fair wind most all  on board sea sick. 22nd Most are still sick Taylor, Turley, & myself some sick, a high wind through the day & a high gale at  night, Boat rocked & pitched Badly. 23rd Sea vary rough & winds high, some still sick 24th Sea mountains high & as  rough as the Hills & valies of Kirtland. when we were in the trough of the sea, the waters would appear to be an hundred feet  above us in the air, the waters broke over the ship, & I got vary wet, & as their was no fire to go to except to cook by, I sat on  deck in the wind untill late in the evening to get dry, & though it was winter it was not vary cold. 25th A calm in the mo  rning, the ship rocked bad upon the dead swells, wind soon rose & we sailed well 26th A rough sea & strong Breeze. 27th fair  winds, but some short squals. got over sea sickness, have a sharp appetite 28th Rough sea saw a large school of Black  fish & porposes. 29th pleasant morning & high breeze though the day. 30th A rough sea severe gale at night. it was with diffi-  culty we could keep our births, while at the same time, Boxes, Barrels, & trunks were tumbling about the cabins. This  with the noise of the Officers, & sailors reefing & taking in sail, together with the sound of the roaring winds & rushing waves  made much confusion. 31st Sea rough, sails under class reef, cloudy weather. This is the Last Day of 1839. Their is  not much to interest the mind while taking a voyage at sea. (excepting the roo^ll^ing [P]illows which are magestic) for one  is frecquently for many days without the sight of land or ever seeing a sail at sea, & must be crouded thick  together in a cabin or stay upon dek in the spray, wind, or storm &c. JAN. 1st 1840. So time rolls along  rough sea, blustering, cloudy, & high winds 2nd The sun rose clear, it being the first time we have seen it for 5 days  we have a calm, a sail is in sight, the first one we have seen since we left New York it is stern of us. 3rd Fair & good breeze  sail 12 miles an hour. We spoke a British Brigg from Halifax 20 days at sea bound for Liverpool in Long. 34.40. We past her  with great speed. 4th Fair weather & wind, stiff Breeze & fast sailing. They had a time of butchering hogs & sheep on board.  5th rough sea, high winds, & rain. We saw a large school of porposes. A calm & pleasant evening which we spent on deck  viewing the stars & Ocean. 6th A calm we have 12 sails spread. 7th A dead calm to day in Lon. 17.40 The passengers shot a number  of fowls which fell dead into the water. We spoke a Scottish Bark from Leith Scotland bound for Granada a west Indies Island 7 days at  sea. We saw a large school of Black fish some of them were 20 feet in length. 8th a good wind. a lighted bar Barrel was sat afloat  from the ship at night which appeared Brilliant at sea. Jan 9th cloudy & cold. smooth sea & fair breeze. We are about enter-  ing the St George's channel. !!! Ho !!! Ho the cry of land land is herd from mast head. We went on to the forecastle & after straining our  eyes for a few moments we got sight of it. It was the Irish Coast lying 3 points to our lee bow. this is the first land we have seen for 20  days. At 8 oclock PM the revolving lamp at the lighthouse a cape clear came in full view. 10th The mountains of the Irish  coast, & also 6 or 7 sail is in ful view weather cloudy, & rather cold. We walked the deck untill 9 oclock viewing the light  houses &c. 11th We had a heavy gale commenced at one oclok in the morning. We were in danger having the Irish coast on one side  ^the^ coast &^of^ wales on the other. their was a great bustle & noise on board from the captain, Mates, sailors, winds & waves &c. We  reached the pilote ground at daylight & raised colours for a pilot... a pilot Boat soon appea[r]ed & came along side & sent a pilot  on board of us, who arived in the midst of the gale. The pilot informed the captain that the steam ship Liverpool had not  yet arived & she left New York 5 days befor[e] we did. & that the packet ship Independance had not reached Liverpool & she left  New York 10 days before us. This intelligence created a great shout of rejoicings on board the ship, for it was the first time  that they had known a steam ship, beaten by a packet ship. but the intelligence was no sooner commun[ic]ated  before the steam ship Liverpool [here] in sight behind us & was gaining upon us. The pilot ordered the sails to be  unreefed notwithstanding it was blowing or gale & we were soon out of sight of the Liverpool again. We had not  sailed but a short time with this speed before the town of Liverpool in England was in sight & an English steam  Boat soon came & took us in tow & soon brought us along side of the quay in Liverpool upon which stood  thousands of human beings looking to see us land. the steam ship Liverpool came up just as we landed  & fired two salutes of cannon at us as she past by. & Also the packet ship Independance came in in a few  minutes after. It was truly a singular circumstance that the Oxford, steam ship Liverpool, & Independance should  all reach the quay at Liverpool within 20 minutes of each other, when one left N.Y. 5 days & the other 10 before the Oxford  but so it was… Thus you see after 22 days sail we arived safe in Liverpool in good health & spirits & for the first time  I began to tread the soil in Old England. We took a walk into the streets of Liverpool. & visited some of the   most Noted places of the Town, such as New Market, Custom House, Lord Nelsons Monument, &c. all of which  were splendid. The Market contained a vast variety of evry kind of meats, fish, fowls, & vegitables that I ever saw  The Custom House was built of hewn stone in the form of an H and covered four acres of grouned. Lord Nelson's  Monument is all of Brass about 14 feet high & 3 rods around it their is 4 large personages as large as life with a chain  around their necks ^hands^ with one end of it in the mouth of a Lion, these are 4 Kings that Lord Nelson subdued in his day.  Lord Nelson stands above those 4 Kings holding 4 crowns [FIGURES] in his hand, & death stands by his side partly covered  with a shroud with one hand upon his Body. these are some of the prominent features of Lord Nelsons monument though  there are others of miner consequence. He was killed in batle while commanding his fleet, his monument is much  Noted in England. Their is not as much taste in general in pollishing, painting, & garnishing the out side of the buil-  -ldings in the cities & towns in England as in America, but they build more for duribility, their buildings are  far more expensive than in America, for they are composed of vast masses of huge stone or brick, though some of their  buildings are far more spe^l^ended than those of America. Their is one thing vary disagreeable throughout England, the whole  hemisphere or air is filled with smoke, smut, & gases, that rise from the dens population & burning of coal &c., the air  is vary heavy & bad for the lungs, but the weather is not cold as in America, it is quite mild weather notwithstanding  England is in 51 to 55 degrees North Lat I have not seen a flake of snow since I left New York is^t^ is 3,500 miles from  New York to  Liverpool. Jan 12 Sunday I attended meeting at St Pauls Church, St Thomases Church which is the church of England I thought it vary  singular to hear the Rector's, & Curit's preach against a form of Godliness without the power theirof & professing religion without  having the fruits of it. while perhaps their is no people more formal than themselves. In the evening I attended meeting at  Pitt street methodist chapel, the speaker appeared quite co[z]y & simple in his manners. All of the above named churches were 
 quite splendid with the pulpit or stand in or near the centre of the house which is the english custom. Another thing  has attracted my attention while visiting public places in England ie a great plainness of dress with both rich & poor  male & female, their cloth may be equ⬦ally as good if not better than that worn in America but they do not appear  as tasty & flashy. I think the Americans pattern more after the French than English in their dress. The Encllish deposit  their dead in vaults in the church yard & them lay the grave stons flat upon the ground over their dead which forms a  pavement to walk upon so you walk over the ded as you go in & out of church. Jan 13th Monday our trunks had to be  taken from the ship & go to the custom Hou⬦se & by examined by the Officer. & after much jaming, crouding and   rocking about, we were permitted to depart with our trunks & baggage after paying 16 ^pence^ sterling on evry pound of Books &  papers that were American that we had with us. We then took the rail road at Liverpool for preston. & for the first mile the cars    run under ground on a track that was cut out of a solid Rock, while buildings & inhabitants were over our heads. The cars  run rapid in England. we arived in Preston, Lancashire, England. at 8 oclok P.M on this 13th day of Jan 1840 in the midst of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints & I soon had Elder W. Richards by the hand & it was truly a happy meeting. I felt to rejoice to once  more behold this Brother face to face & all the Saints who flocked around us with great rejoicings, after spending most of the night in con  versation I retired to rest. 14th Preston contains a population of 60,000 the streets are crouded with the poor going to & from the  the factories wearing wooden or clog shoes which makes a great ratling over the pavement. The poor here in England I should  think were under as great Bondage as the children of Egypt Israel in Egypt. We held a council at Elder Richards house in  Preston on Jan 17th & the following was one of the Resolutions post. Resolved that Elder's John Tailor & Joseph Fielding go to Liverpool &  Elders Hiram Clark & Wm Clayton labour in Manchester & Elder Willi^a^rd Richards tarry in Preston & its neighbourhood & Willford  Woodruff & Theadore Turley go to the Potteries & warn the People in that place & then inquire the mind of the Lord & if it is his will go  to Birmingham. The potteries contain a population of 65,000 persons & Birmingham 300,000 & the place is larger than New york  & is in the centre of England 18th I took the parting hand with the Saints in Preston & in company with Elders Turley and  Clark took the rail car & rode to Manchester 36 miles whare we were soon greeted by Elder William Clayton & many Saints.  Manchester is a vary beatiful Town containing a Pop of 280,000 souls & is as large as New york on the ground. It already has a  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in it, with 164 members & the work still rolling on. It is the Metropolis of the cotton  manifactoring district in England. I had not been in the place but a few minutes before I was called upon with my Brother  to visit a sister possessed with the devil & a burning fever. When we arived at the house she was in great rage & required 3 or 4 men  to keep her from taring herself to peaces. We lade hands upon her & commanded the devil to come out of her in the name of  Jesus Christ & also rebuked the fever & after a mighty struggle the devil came out of her, & the fever left her, & she was come [calm]  & composed. The devel entered into her child next morning & made it stiff as a stake. we lade hands upon the child & rebu[k]ed  the devil in the name of Jesus Christ & he instantly came out & the child fell asleep, & the woman attended meeting during the day  I do not speak of these things boasting, but thank my Heavenly Father that he is rebuking the devourer for our sakes. 19th  Sunday I preached to day in Manchester to a crouded congregation, it is the first time that I have preached the gospel in England  the people gave good attention, many that were sick came forward to be healed, we lade hands upon 20 most of which were  healed. The ordinance of Baptism was also administered. Jan 21st I left Manchester & in company with Elder Turley took coach  & road (on the outside as the custom is) through Stockport, Mackelsfield, Congleton, Tunstell, & to Burslem at the Potteries & spent the night with Elder Alfred Corden  This is our place of labour for a few days or weeks. I am now in the midst if the Potteries which are so noted in England whare most  of the English china, crockery & stone were ware is made Pop. 65,000. Their ^x^ is an Elder lives in this town by the name of Alfred Cordon  he went 40 miles to recieve the work & be baptzed & was ordained an Elder. he works in the potter^i^es in Burslem 6 days in a  week for his daily bread & preaches evry evening in a week & 3 times on Sunday & he has alredy a little flock of Saints of  66 in number around him. When We arived in England we found the churches under excellent order & dissipline; the Saints  have the utmost confidence in their Elders, knowing they are the servants of God. consequently they give strict heed to their  teachings. We soon expect most of the Twee^l^ve in this country. We shall then hold a general conference, & my prayer to God is  that all of the Quorum of the Twelve that come^c^ome from America will have means to come soon & labour while the day last  for I believe that what we do in Old England must be done quickly. Elders Mullenner & Wright are in Scotland have began  to preach & to Baptize. Elder Wright has had the small pox since he went to Scotland, & the doctors told him to take medicine  & keep warm or die, but he took no medicine continued to go about his business was but little sick & soon got well. persecution  does not rage much yet in England, sometimes the Elders get the candlesticks & candles flung at their heads while preaching &  occasionally stoned in the streets but in general good attention is paid. Jan 24 I preached  in the town of Stoke Elder Turley followed  me two were Baptzed. 25th Sunday I preached in Burslem & Elder Turley in Hanley. We Baptzed 3 persons. We have crouded & att[en]ti[ve]  congregations. We have now sent out appointments in a number of new places in the adjoining towns. We have found  it to be the will of God to open a door immediately in Birmingham which is about 50 miles from these potteries, one of us will  go there day after tomorrow probably Elder Turley, we are determined to immediately erect the standard in evry town from the  potteries to Birmingham which is a number of large towns & vary populous & whare they have not as yet herd the  word at all, But it will give at least one million of souls the privili^e^ge of hearing the word. I think some of making  Birmingham my stand for labour for a seasons as it is mear the centre of  England & contains a large number of inha  bitants & will open a vast field of labour beteen the potteries & Birmingham. & we have already given out appointments part  of the way. My Dear Wife As I have taken up most of this sheet in giving you an account of our journey & of the country  &c. I will now give some general remarks concerning the signs of the times & the vineyard of the Lord in this Eastern  country. Signs, wonders, & fearful sights are appearing, & the words of the Ancient & modern Prophets are fulfillings in this land  Eearthquakes are following each other in quick succession, fires are vary frecquent. A great light lately appeared in London   so that the fireman with their Engines rushed to one part of the city supposed it to be on fire but found it to be in  the heavens. At Kanturk Dec 26, 1839 300 acres of Col Lonford's bog land rose up from its mighty bed & travled with the rapidity   of a steam Engine for the distance of a steam 4 miles through the country carrying destruction in its progress rising in   angry surges like the ungovernable sea heaving from 10 to 30 feet of Earth upon the land in many places as it past over   & in addition to these & many other signs awful awful is the state of things thoroughout England, hundreds of thousands  of people have met together in different places against the government or determined to have a reform in the  government they are called chartist or radicals. the Queen & parliment depend upon the Ma^i^litia to  to protect them, & they have to be vary busy to break up the plots which are lade to break out in a civel   war. Thousands are in a state of almost utter starvation, whole families are going th[r]ough the streets begging  Bread from dore to dore. hundreds of people in one town will be turned out of the factories & out of   Employ & bread in one day, & I see them standing in large groups at the corners of the streets consulting   what to do, & in fact the whole face of the Earth is ripened in iniquity & sin as well as trouble & distress  & it appears as though the earth was ownly spared for a little season that the worning voice may go  through. The English Publications of late have given an account of the excitement of the Radical question &c.  for my part I have nothing to do with any of these matters of the government any further than to exhort  the Saints to be as quiet as possible & be subject to the Laws of the Land & the powers that be. but it   requires the greatest of prudence & wisdom to hold public meetings & do the work of God in this country at the present  time & under the present state of things. But I believe the harvest of Old England is fully ripe & must spedily be 
 be reapted if the wheat is sowed. & God is a[s]sisting his servents in this country, & the work is begining to roll forth   more & more whare it is faithfully proclaimed & signs do truly follow believers for which we feel thankful. I   believe that churches will spedily be esstablished in London, Liverpool, Birmingham & that all of the capitol   places of England will hear the sound of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There appears to be many looking for truth   to come forth from some quarter & they appear willing to hear, receive & imbrace it when it comes unto   them & while we are preaching & baptizing such as shall be saved in England our Brethren have also began to   preach & baptize in Scotland & thus the work rolls on. pray for us that our work may be finished spedily  that truth may prevail upon the face of the earth. We hold a meeting every evening in a week & several times on the   Sabbath & baptize almost daily. Jan 27th I preached last night in Burslem to a crowded congregation & a man   came forward with two constables as I was informed to keep the peace while he read a pamphlet containing Mormon-  ism unveiled W Parish's letters P. P. Pratts letters, signed Luke Johnson, & John F Boyanton [Boynton]. &c &c I was informed   the man was a Methodist preacher & brought the constables with him because he feared the people. We helped him   to read it what we could by giving him lights, & water to quench his thirst. I think on the whole it did no injury  I answered him when he got through, & the people herd my answer with attention. All stories & reports that were   afloat in America are now going the rounds in England, but they will ownly stir the people up to come   out & hear &c. but I will leave this part of the subject. I have many things I wish to say to you, but   you see that I have touched upon a variety of things appertaining to my journey, the country & the vine  yard of the Lord &c in this land. B[u]t I will now say that I feel exceding anxious to hear from you   by some means or other, yes my desire to recceve a letter from you is vary great. for I have never recceved   but one letter from you since I left Montrose the 8th day of last August, I have written 7 or   8 letters to you since I left you how many of them you have obtained I know not. I feel vary   anxious to hear from you & Sarah Emma & also about the Church around you, perhaps you may  have written some letters that may be on the way that I may yet get I hope this is the case. I want   you to write as soon as you get this, wont you & give me an account of all matters & things   with you & Sarah, how your health is, & how you get along for help; food & rament, is their war between   Missouri & Ioway, tell all the news of a National character, I herd New Orleans was destroyed by   the Mississppi River is it so, how is the Saints getting along in Montrose, Lovely Street, & Commerce   tell me all about it. are they publishing the times & Seasons. give my respects to all the friend[s]  in Lovely Street, Mo[n]trose, & Commerce as far as you have an opportunity. Elder T[aylor]  [page torn]    sent a letter home [to] [page torn] his family a few days since in Commerce. I expect Elder Taylor h[as] [page torn]   written to his family by this time. Remember me to all of our friends unto who you [page torn]  write. I shall not have time to send many as lengthy letters as this to America, but I shall endea  vour to give you an account of all important matters with me. & I hope you will write to   [m]e a[s] often as you can conveneintly please drect your next letter to Mr Willford Woodruff   in care of Alfred Cordon ^Club Buildings^ Navigation road at Mr Godwin's works, Burslem, Staffordshire England. It is a long direc^t^ion  I know but it is my place of address at present, please pay the postage to New York or it will not come  but if paid there it will come safe. I will also pay the postage on the letters that I write to you as far as N.Y.   also. I will direct this letter to Commerce Illinois & diret the post Master to inform you of it   I do this lest their should be some difficulty about the post Office at Montrose. I do not value the writing  of a lengthy letter letter like this if you ownly obtain it. & I do pray my heavenly Father that you may  obtain this letter. & that it may n[o]t [page torn] be written in vain. Phebe I hope I shall continue to share in   your prayers, remember me consta[n]tly [page torn] at the Throne of grace that I may have Wisdom, grace, & fa[ith] [page torn]   according to my day: & I do pray the Lord to Bless you, with health & strength & suppoort you in   the midst of all troubles, trials, temptations, afflictions & distress untill the end come when we may  enter unto that rest together which remains for the people of God. Jan 29th I held a meeting last evening in New Castle & preached to an attentive congregation one offered himself for Baptzm. I have this morning visited   the large silk factory in New Castle & seen them make silks from the ball or raw article to the weavers loom  whare ribbons, sattins, & silks, are finished. I have since walked to Burslem 3 miles though Parks, lanes, fields, & while the sun   shines beatiful & pleasant, the parks, walks, & fields, are as green as they would be in the month of May in America. I sit   down this morning to finish this Letter as I cannot write as lengthy letter as this at once for I am broke   of by many calls, so I have had several spells about it. & now Phebe wont you sit down & do so by me give   me a kind of a journal or history of all things with you [&] Sarah. E. since I left you ie if you are able, git  a large sheet & fill it full. I want to know about the sickness & who is dead. & what Joseph & Sidney done at Washington  & what the prospect is concerning the Church & its progress in America. What news have you from our friends  in Maine remember me to all of Father Carters family when you write. I do not know that you will be able to  read all of this letter but make it out as well as you can. please keep this letter & not lose it as I shall wish  to see it when I come home. I do not yet know how long my mission will be in England but I calculate to  labour faithfully while I do labour that I may the sooner get through & again meet with my family  But my Dear Friend & Companion let us try to be resigned to the will of God in all things relative to our seperation  for a season, for it is to do the work of God, to fill a responsible station in preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ  & warn the people of this generation, & prune the vineyard once more, that the children of God may be pre-    [page torn] [-pai]red for the coming of the Son of Man. & if we are faithful in this great work, & do the will of Jesus Christ & are   wise stewards over the things commtted to our charge, the war will soon be ended & the victory won, then how  sweet will be our rest, how great our glory, how rich our  reward & how Eternal our happiness. & May the Lord   Jesus Christ intercede for us, & all Saints that we may overcome through the Blood of the Lamb that when he   comes we may be like him & reign with him upon the Earth which may our Heavenly Father grant for Christs sake Amen    I remain forever your Companion & Friend    Willford Woodruff    Phebe W.

 [sideways text] Orson Hyde Dec 29 1860 [end of sideways text]    Hon.[or] W. Woodruff, Moroni Sanpete Co U T    Dear Brother, Dec 29, 1860.    I owe you many  apologies for not earlier answering your kind  letter of the 20th Ult. ins I have written to my  family in the city but once since I left, and  have seen my wife in Sanpete but about three  times since the President was here. I have been   very busy in building me a house and in  preaching the gospel. Away from home I seldom  could find a decent pen, or a half sheet of clean  paper. I have written a little through necessity  and a very little only. I might urge many othr  reasons for not writing sooner, but none for want  of a disposition to write. I have not had time  even to write a love letter, however strong my in-  clinations may have been to do so. I never labor  ed with body and mind more intently in my life  than during the past season. I Am now reduced  to the size of a decent man. But my house is  so far finished that my goods are pitched into  it, and have left my family to regulate for  themselves while I go to Fillmore where I   expect to be on New Years night. I am now  on my way there.    Accept my thanks for your Kind  attention to my vineyard. It was a swamp 
 Snow at Springtown is about 18 Inches deep and  at this place about 6, and only 6 miles apart. We have  had a beautifully mild season until Wednesday last when  the snow fell very freely and it became intensly cold. We have  no wind storms to do us any serious damage in the county  with the exception of about one third of the roof of the Meeting  house at Fort Ephraim which was blown off by reason  of a door being left open and the house being tight, it had  to burst. But it is all repaired. I regret the losses sustained  by our Brethren in the North, yet I am thankful that no  human lives were lost. Speaking of Judgments, the Lord  said, "My saints shall hardly escape." Sickness and death  are our common lot; and though the summons be direct  against us or our best friends, we have to obey the mandate  Sickness is only one trial to prepare us for glory, and death  the gate through which the just enter into it.    Bro. Gibson, of whom you speak, is something more  than a political Mormon, I hope. He has an extensive  mission. I hope he may do good, he can do no harm to   the cause.    The road from the North Bend to Spanish Fork is worked  through for horsemen and empty wagons, but to make it  a good and safe thoroughfare, will require very much more  labor. Many of the citizens here have petitioned for an  appropriation to work it through. Not, however, by my counsel  or suggestion, not but that such a measure is desirable  to me; but I think the Legislation has appropriated too much  already for individual aggrandizement with the view of  public good. I have counseled the people to forward their 
 Petitions to Hon G. A. Smith instead of forwarding them  to a man who, after voting for a measure, turns round and  says, "you can't do any thing—it is the height of nonsense  to ask two dollars a bushel for wheat when it can be  bought for a dollar or a dollar and a quarter." We  want men who can do something. "You can't, you can't"  never built, even, a house of Commons, let a lone the Kingdom  of God. But when stray cattle are required to pay private  liabilities, the tone changes to, "I can, I can." This is no priva  cy. It    Two weeks ago today, I preached just such a discourse in  Manti as I hinted to them that I should th in the second discourse  that I preached there. It made quite a fluttering in some quarters,  yet the masses of the people brightened as though ten tuns burthen  had been removed from their shoulders. Many were in tears,  others smiled, some as white as ghosts while the power of  God enabled me to tell things about as existing evidence  will substantiat[e] them. One remarked that that discourse  caused many a drooping branch to lift up its head  It was a faithful warning to evil doers.    When a legal Governor vetoes the acts of an illegal Legisla  ture, it is as 'twas; and 'twas as 'tis    Lincoln is Elected, and God's will in that is done.  The times are becoming quite interesting. The Lord help   all parties on in the way they want to go.    The people are gathered for meeting so I must stop  writing and go to preaching    6 o'clock Sunday evening  and all is well. Your Brother in the gospel    Orson Hyde 
 P.S. I perceive by the News that Bro Gardner Snow of  Manti City is elected Probate Judge for this County. He is  a very good man; but is completely wraped up in his son  Warren and in George Peacock. The people of Sanpete  have paid Taxes now for many years, and no improvements  can be seen but the jail half finished by Bishop Snow. It  is like all improvements in Manti, unfineshed. Several  Back houses have been begun, but I know not one finished  The jail in like condition. $4,500 was the contract price  for completeing it, as I am told, when $2,000 would build and  complete a much better building than that would be of finished  The county is greatly in debt, and no improvements that are  of much or any use at all. The tithing office has suffered,  the county has suffered, the Perpetual Fund has suffered  The people have suffered by their stoks [stock] being made into  strays and then into beef. The Indian department has  suffered, Missionaries have suffered by their donations going  in the same way. The people of Sanpete think the  Bourbons have reigned long enough, and that Bornbas  Dynasty should end. If the county seat were removed  forom Manti to Moroni or to Springtown it would  suit the notions of the people much better. If to Moroni  M. D Hamilton should be Probate Judge, if to Springtown,  Redick Allred should be appointed the Judge, I have  expressed no opinion here as to the removal of the county  seat, neither any with regard to this choice of a Judge  yet the above are my true sentiments and 19 twentieths  of the people here would endorse them, the opinion  of our representative to the contrary notwithstanding 
 Elder W. Woodruff said the only way for  the Committee to do was for them to do  just what Prest. Young wanted them to do  let us unite and cooperate as a people, and  turn out our means to relieve Prest. Young,  and become part owners of the Railroad --    the Lord has blest us, and we are all better  off, than ever before and let us find out what  our duty is and then do it -- He was willing  to do all he could himself &c 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff Strongly recommended the  brethren to exercise Faith and prayer for Governor  Chaffer, the Judges and the other members of the ring.  & that the Lord would overrule their acts for the good of  Israel. 
 Elder W. Woodruff regarded this school was one of the greatest  priveleges the Elders can enjoy—we are taught here  how to build up the Kingdom of God—we can see  the hand of God in inspiring his servant Brigham  in opening this school, the Cooperative movement  &c which soon developed a secret of plot of apostacy  And which had been revealed to Prest Young some time  before it was making made manifest.    The cup of this Nations iniquity will soon  be filled up, and the judgments of God will break  it to pieces.    He then read a little from page 79 Doc & Cov.  and by making comparisons with what is found  in the Bible, Book of Mormon & Doc & Covr. pertaining  to Father Adam, as to ^who^ he was &c, we can learn  much that will strengthen our faith & comfort our  hearts.    Dad by day the Gentiles who are constantly  coming up to Zion, are fulfilling the scriptures. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff  said the Lord intends   to build up Zion, but the enemy is so   far on the alert, that we may expect   to be met on all sides. the Land question   is very important, and should not be neglected,   or we will suffer by it. Ours is a   constant warfare, and has been from the   beginning. we have got to watch and   guard ourselves, lest the enemy gets an   advantage over us.    4    God was going to build up Zion on this Land   and we ought to carry out the counc^i^l of his   Servants. We had got to Labour, and cease   to sustain the enemies of our God.    Though the Government, through its Officials  are seeking to destroy every constitutional  right, and deprive us of them, they will certainly   find it a dear bought effort, for if we do our   duty, God will frustrate their plans, and bring   them to shame. 
 He hoped every Elder & boy in Israel, will have a  good rifle and ammunition, all in readiness  to defend ourselves and families, that God and  Angels may see that we are willing to do  anything that is required of us—  but He for one had great Faith in prayer—  let every saint bear up before the Lord those  who are in our midst seeking to destroy us  he believed God will not only hear, but answer  the prayers of his Saints, which are offered up  in earnestness & faith. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff said we have not sufficiently   realized our responsibilitys as parents or members of   the church, though he himself had always been   used to work, and his wives and children also   had to work and be industrious, it was not   right for us to allow our children to be out late   at night, and mingle with evil associations. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff had visited Fort Herriman   preached there, and attended a party—   He bitterly complained of conduct which he   had been eyewitness to in Bp Gardners ward ^at a party^  and was sorry that Bp Gardner was not present  to day—Bishops ought to be the most   honest of any people in the Territory—and   especially those who have charge of cooperative   stores, and not permit their wives and   daughters to draw goods out of the store   without Keeping out any account of it—    Bp Gardner ought to be had before Bp Hunter  and tried for such conduct—  in permitting such deviltry to exist in his ward. 
 they should be taught to respect and honour their parents.    He was truly thankful for the institution of Sabbath   Schools, and our children should be sent there  to learn the principles and doctrine of Christ.    Some of us will soon pass away, and the   responsibilities of the Kingdom of God, will fall   upon the heads of our children, therefore they   should be instructed in everything that pertains   to the government of God. Zion will conquer,   and prevail, and our duties ^which^ are ^of^ the most   various kinds, if we will only attend to them,  we shall gain an experience that will qualify   us for increasing usefulness. We should teach   our wives, (in our absence) to pray with their fa  children, and teach them to be honest.    also, that when they find anything, it is not   theirs, but seek to find the owner.    We have been greatly blest, and softened the   hearts of men in our behalf in times past,  and if we do right, God will give our ^us^ power   to retain our possessions and keep the balance   of power in this city. 
  Elder W. Woodruff  sanctioned the remarks   of the previous speaker, said no one living   in the Zion of Enock would make promises   and not fulfill them, and before we can   enter into the order of Enock, we have got   to practise the principle of righteousness 
 Elder W. Woodruff was glad to hear the voice   of Prest Young's voice again, to listen to his councils -   the Spirit of God had been with Prest Wells h  during his absence. He also refered to the wicked   world who are much opposed to the Kingdom   of God as ever, there [h]as been a strong combination   among the wicked to bring us into trouble during   the past winter, but we have been preserved, and   have met in our School, Tabernacle & Ward Houses,   without interruption. It was also a wise sugges-  tion of Prest Young to introduc^e^tion the use of oxen   for during much of our labour instead of Horses   as a source of economy.    He also named a few things about the mines.  the hand of the Lord was in it, and much good   would come out of it. Let farmers cultivate   the soil, and every mechanic cleave to his mechanism 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we should watch and pray   and especially deposit our votes on Monday next, and   use every means to influence others do the same. 
 if every man would fulfil their their promises   to each other, confidence will be increased  both Joseph Smith & prest. Young have taught   us the principles of Honesty and Integrity   and we should try to carry them out.    The rules of the School are just and good,  and we should observe them.    We cannot be saved in the Celestial Kingdom   of God, unless we practise principles of   righteousness & Honesty—it does not pay   any of us to do wrong—He teaches his  children to be honest, and he believes they   will grow up as Honest men.    We must not encourage our children to do   wrong, if we do, they are lit almost sure   to make it manifest as they grow up.  Let us set good examples before our wives   and children.    He then recommended the brethren to get up   what Horses or Cattle they have over Jordan,   if not, we shall certainly lose them, for their   is no feed for them there.    Put them in Cooperative Herds where   they can be taken where proper care of 
 by and bye, we shall see the wisdom that God   has in permitting them to be opened here & there    He had been absent a few days looking   out a Herd ground for a Cooperative Herd,   and hoped the brethren would rally round the   effort and help it along.    Zion will arise, and triumph on the face   of the earth, and all opposition will have   to give way, and the Kingdom will be built   up. We must attend to our prayers, and our   works must be good, and we shall have a home   here, and the wicked and ungodly will have no  power to prevent it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff felt thankful that he   lived to see the commencement of a   grand cooperative movement, which   he had no doubt would continue   until it circumscribed the whole of our   temporal matters. We should learn   to sustain ourselves, and leave off as fast   as possible the patronage of our enemies.   Let alone those who support our bitter   enemies. He heartily endorsed this movement,   and prayed that we might grow brighter and   brighter. Motioned & Seconded, & Carried    That the Constitution be accepted and   the Books be opened for subscription. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said the nearer we   get to the Lord, the more mercy we see displayed   towards erring humanity - hence it is that   Prest Young entertains the most merciful  feelings towards those who have done wrong   and would gladly assst towards reclaiming   them. And he for one did not feel like   saying anything to oppose it 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff Gave out a notice of a 1/4 Sec. of land   in the Pulsipher field, and requested all landowners of   that 1/4 Section to meet at the close of the School, as some-  thing had to be done, or the land would be lost. 
 Elder W. Woodruffrecommended us to travel in travel  shallow water, and not to trouble ourselves   about the mysteries that are all around us-   spoke of the increase of infidelity among   the nations of the world.    Let any one deny the Holy Ghost and   the atonement of Jesus Christ, then the   Devil leads them to lead shed innocent blood. 
 Elder W. Woodruff gave a graphic account of his   experience with a very severe Snow Storm, on his   way from Randolph to Evanston, having to travel  some 15 miles in the Storm, and after a very   providential opening, he reached Ogden, and   finally to this City, in health and strength, for   which he acknowledges the hand of the Lord.    It is our duty to trust in God, be diligent,  and faithful & true in all our duties to God   and each other, and the Kingdom will be   established in spite of all the opposition   that is now arrayed against it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said ever since he was a little   boy, he never could think there was anybody on   the earth that loved the Lord, unless there was a   Head and body of the Church, which is so   beautifully exprest by the Apostle Paul.    He had observed a greadt many cripples in his   life, some lacking one limb and some another-   but he never say ^saw^ any without a Head- so with   the Christian world, having no Head, are without   life, just as much as a natural body, without   a Head  one. He was not at all surprised   at the persecution we are receiving, he was astonished  that we did not have more, but God will bring   us off victorious. Since we had openly come   out with the principle of Polygamy, God had   thrown a shield around us, and protected us. 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said the Lord never fails in any   promise that he gives to the children of men.   He deals with men in on the most broad demo  cratic principles. The Law that God has revealed to   us in this day, is easily understood by the most   illiterate—this Law of the Gospel was given that   man might be brought back into his presence, and   exalted in the Celestial Kingdom, but the human   family must abide the Law, as or they cannot   gain the promise. He felt to rejoice that Prest.  Young was here with us again—when he was first   arrested, he said, that all their efforts would turn out   a great fizzle—the Prayers of the servants of God   have prevailed, and God has delivered those ^who^ were in  bonds. We should never lose sight of the promises,  and so live, that we can lawfully claim them.    When Pres.t Young first set foot on this temple block, he   put down his cane upon it and said, Here the greater   Temple of God will be built.    No man who has l ever lifted up his hand against   this Kingdom, as ever pro^s^pered. No weapon that   was ^is^ formed against Zion can prosper. this prophecy   has been most remarkably fulfilled.    We shall prosper, if we keep the commandments of   God-the Hand of God has been over us as a   people. 
 The Nation we live in, has become corrupt with   Whoredoms, Thieving, & every foul crime that will   shortly sink it to perdition. It may be that the   highest tribunal in the land, viz The Supreme Court,   may also be induced to turn against us -- the   President has tried his hand, and perhaps Congress   may legislate against us -- but the Lord will  bring us off victorious. And this nation   will fill up the measure of their iniquity. 
 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P.O. Box, B. Salt Lake City, Utah. March 19th, 1894.    Elder Cornelius D. Schettler,  Dear Brother:    I have taken it upon myself to write a few lines to our young  Elders who went together from Salt Lake upon their first mission to  Germany. We have had a number of letters from Owen, and I have liked  very much the spirit of them.    Mrs. Woodruff and myself took supper with your father and  mother on the 14th and we had a good time. Herman and Irene made us  splendid music. A good deal was said about Cornelius' mission and the  other boys. Of course, you are now beginning to make your first mark  in the ministry. I have been there before you and I know what it is;  though you have the language to learn, which I did not. I went on my  first mission without purse or srcrip. I went through the wilderness,   waded swamps, traveled alone as a priest, and baptized many that I could  not confirm.  You are a Seventy and can attend to all the ordinances  necessary in organizing branches of the Church. I have great hopes in  you young men. I suppose you naturally will have some difficulty in  preaching to these foreign governments considering the laws and politics.  But I think there is a good deal of the blood of Israel in Germany and  Switzerland. We have everything to encourage us in searching out hthe  honest in heart among the nations. The Lord told Oliver Cowdery that if  he spent his whole life in saving one soul how great would be his joy in  the eternal world over that one soul. I have felt that I have great  cause to rejoice in that respect; I have had the credit of bringing more 
 souls into the Church than any one man in the Church; I do not know how  that is. I brought two thousand into the Church in the south of England-  in Herefordshire, &c., in 1840; but I never felt to boast or to take any  credit to myself in any of these things, for it was God not Wilfeord  Woodruff that did it. Yet I felt it was a great blessing to be an  instrument in the hands of God of performing siuch a work. So I look upon  you young brethren who are sent now to the nations of the earth to preach  the gospel and save the souls of men.  No greater or more glorious work  could you be called to.  Therefore, my dear brother, take hold with all  your might. Call upon the Lord in mighty prayer for the Holy Ghost to  be with you to give you power to preach the Gospel and give you souls in  search of your ministry, and the Lord will hear your prayers and give  you power to accomplish a good mission which will be a satisfaction to  yourself and your friends and acceptable unto God who has called you.  And this applies not only to yourself, but to every Elder with you, and  all who are in the vineyard of the Lord. Therefore, fear not, but labor  faithfully to prune the vineyard once more for the last time and prepare  the earth for the coming of the Son of Man. Avoid all evil, resist all  temptations, and the angels of God will be your constant companions.    Give my love and blessing to Prest. Naegle and wife and all the  Elders with you. I am interested in the welfare of every Elder laboring  in the vineyard of the Lord.    Spencer Clawson's wife died last week, and will be buried on  Sunday. I would be glad to hear from you and know how you are getting  along. Sister Woodruff, Blanch and Alice join me in love to you and Bro.  and Sister Naegle.    From your Brother in the Gospel,   Wilford Woodruff

 De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hovedkontor  for den skandinaviske Mission.  Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.    Kjebenhavn, Sept. 12 1893.    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother:    When I was appointed to take charge of the  Scandinavian Mission, May 1st Bro. Joseph  Christiansen turned over to me as "Resources,"   a list of notes due this Offise from parties now  in Utah, which notes, according to your suggestions  had been sent to you for colection, in order to  help this office out with the much needed  funds.  I write this by way of a reminder.  I will also state, that during the last few months  but very little money has been sent from home, to  this office for Emigrations; The few emigrants  that has goen this summer, has mostly goen  on money that has been to thier or here for a long  time, and as stated above, but very little has  come from home to Reimburse the office.  We  have had several calls from home for money, that  has been sent here for Emigrations, but when the  parties, for whom it was intended could not go "at  once", the money was recalled.  I suppose because  of the hard times at home and the scarcity of money.  All this has drained us interely and we are  not now able to remit to Liverpool the full  amounts for the emigrations as they go.  If 
 De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hovedkontor  for den skandinaviske Mission.  Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.    Kjebenhavn, _____, 189_____    we had the cash which these notes represents  then we would be allright as far as the  emigrations is concerned.  I expect Prest.  Lund over here next week and I shall then  take great plasure in showing him the  condision of the mission financily,  I hope  to hear from you favorably on this matter.  The work of God is progressing in this  lands, many are investigating the Gospel  afpecialy in Norway and Sweden and if we  only had more missionaries to send up  there much more good could be done.    I remain yours in the Gospel of christ    C. A. Carlquist    Bro. Jack sayes, we are doing the best we  can to collect those notes, but in these hard  times, no one seems able to pay,  and there  is but little hope of getting the money just now.    Besides the Copenhagen office has drawn on the Lpool office and the latter has drawn  on this office, and will no doubt continue  to do so.    J. F. S.

Kjebenhavn, Feb. 13 1894  President Wilford Woodruff   Salt Lake City, Utah    Dear Brother:  Thinking the enclosed letter would interet you I   send it, I would translate it but knowing that   this can be done at your office and knowing that   the original gives a better idea I take the liberty   of sending it. Brother Anderson came here last   May and was according to your wish, sent to the   City of Stockholm, where he gained admittance to the   best school in this country for the study which he   was to pursue—Figure Molding. When Prest. Lund   and I visited Stockholm conference last fall we had   several talks with brother Anderson and learned   that he was progressing very rapidley, using   every opertunity offered for study.  The teachers   seems to take a special interest in him and he   feels that the Lord has His hand in this—    Praying God to bless us all in our efforts to   do good I remain your brother in the Gospel    C.

Kjebenhavn March 13 1891    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:    We need thirty missionaries for the Scandinavian  Mission as early as possible in the Fall of 1891. As to  nationality and dialect, they should be divided as follows:  Danish, 8: for Stockholm and Goteborg, Sweden, 12; for  Skane, Sweden, 4; for Christiania, Norway, 6.    Our progress during the past four months,  has averaged that of the past two winters. A number  of the older brethren, however, have been unable to work,  owing to sickness, which has crippled our work some.  As far as I know; all are now well.    The present edition of the Danish Hymn Book is  nearly exhausted, and before a new edition is published,  the work should be carefully revised, which should be  done so that we could send it to press next winter.  I think this labor is of great importance, as it is a  fact that our hymns have a great influence in spread-  ing the truth, and numbers of people have been con-  verted by hearing and reading our songs. I suggest,  therefore, that a committee of interested and capable  Scandinavians be selected to do the revising, which, to  save expence, should be done at home in Utah, and the  work sent over here for publication.  To make it what  it should be, there are a number of improvements needed 
 in the book which will be fully apparent to those who  undertake the task. The meter should be changed in   a number of the songs so as to make these suitable for  our psalmody music instead of the folk-lore melodys  now used, which are often very inappropriate in  a house of worship; and more of the principles and  doctrines should be treated upon with less of Zion  and the gathering, which latter not only the Saints, but  even strangers are often too eager to embrace. A  considerable proportion of those who emigrate each  year are Gentiles, and our people are continually  sending for their friends who care nothing in a num-  ber of instances, for the Gospel, but often prove of  great injury to the cause by returning unfavorable  writings to these lands, after they are gathered.    Elders J. M. Sjodahl, P. O. Thomasen, and C. C. A. Chris-  tensen would be among the best that could be found  to do the work of revision, or to supervise it, with the   assistance of such other talent as might be selected.  Elder C. E. Thorstensen, a good choir leader, who is now  working in this office, but who expects to return home   next Fall, would be of much assistance in the work  owing to his musical ability, and his familiarity with  the wants of choirs and singers in this mission.    Hoping that these matters will received your  favorable consideration, and praying God to bless you  abundantly, I remain,    Your brother in the Gospel of Christ,  Edw. H. Anderson. 
 Den skandinaviske Missions Kontor.  Lorentzengade Nr. 14, 1. Sal. Kjebenhavn Nov. 8 1890    President Wilford Woodruff,   Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:  I have just made a round tour of this   mission, leaving here on Oct. 4th, and returning  on the 3d of the present month. I have sent Prest.   Young an account in detail of our conferences, and  of matters as I found them. The work is progress-  ing quite favorably in this mission, and especially  do we find many in Northern Sweden who investi-  gate the principles of the Gospel. During the past  six months there have been 312 baptisms in the   mission.    We will need 20 missionaries next spring,   which should be divided as follows:   Danes—5; from Stockholm or Goteborg, North-  ern Sweden—7; from S Kane, southern Sweden—  4; from Norway—4,. We can not use South-  ern Swedes for the north part of that country;  and as the northern portion is the best  field we hope to have the full quota for  that part as early as they can be sent over;  in fact, it would be well if they were now  in the field.    I take the liberty of suggesting that we 
 Den skandinaviske Missions Kontor.  Lorentzensgade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.    Kjebenhavn 189    need a Danish writer and a Swedish writer, to  relieve the brethren who are now laboring in that   calling. It is well to have them on hand, so as to  familiarize themselves with their work, some length  of time before the present laborers leave. I suggest  as the Danish translator Elder O. J. Anderson, of  Castle Dale, Emery Co. and as the Swedish translator,   Elder Charles Kallstrom of Logan. These brethren  should be here early in the summer. We need  also some specially qualified men to relieve the   Conference presidents who will return next sum-  mer and fall. I suggest the following names  from which a selection could be made:    Danes: Jos. Christiansen, Mayfield SanpeteCo.  Dr. Chr: Madsen, Salina, SevierCo.  John Christophersen, Richmond CacheCo.  I. C. Thoresen, Hyrum, Cache Co.    Swedes: Hugo Peterson, Salt Lake City.   Charles Nyman, Logan.   John Bowman, Jr. Monroe, Sevier Co.  C. A. Carlquist, Salt Lake City    Norwegians: C. H. Monsan, Richmond, Cache  Chr: Bouderud, Salina, Sevier Co.  Ingebrigt Paulsen, Salina  Hans A. Petersen, Logan. 
 Den skandinaviske Missions Kontor.  Lorentzensgade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.    Kjebenhavn 189    Among these, I will name I. C. Thoresen, Hyrum;   Jes. Christiansen Mayfield; C. A. Carlquist Salt  Lake City; and C. H. Monsen, Richmond, as  men who would be good laborers in the  field and who could hold responsible po-  sitions.    Trusting that these suggestions may not  be out of place, and that the subject may  receive the consideration that its importance   demands, I remain,    Your humble brother in the cause of God,    Edw. H. Anderson    P.S.—I would like to know as early as possible   in relation to the translators, as we have here-  tofore found it difficult to get them here on  time.    E. H. A

Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City,   Utah    Dear Brother:  I herewith enclose a list of  names of persons recommended as being quali-  fied and capable of filling missions in Scan-  dinavia, and if you deem it proper we would  be pleased to have them called and sent to these  countries to assist in the work of the Lord.  I sent a similar list to Prest. Young at Liver-  pool on the 9th Jan., but for some cause it can not  now be found there, and, having been mislaid, it  has not been forwarded to you.  It is therefore  by the suggestion of Prest. Young, or the brother  at Liverpool having charge of the mission,  that I send this list direct to you.  It is now  very late, but these Elders were intended to have  been among the Spring supply of missionaries.  You have no doubt by this time been informed  of the number of needed for Scandinavia -- 30,  (12 Swedes, 8 [Norwegians ] and 10 Danes.)    By request of Prest. Young, I also send you  a list of notes due this office from parties most  by residing in Utah.  These amounts have been  loaned to the respective parties on their promise  of paying same as specified in the notes; some 
 2    De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hoveddkontor  for den skandinaviske Mission  Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.    Kjebenhavn, _______ 189__.    of these accounts are now nearly ten years  old, and, to judge from the past, they will  never be paid if left in this office.  I would  suggest, that these notes be sent to the church  office in Salt Lake City for collection, and  this office, if possible, get credit for the a-  mounts, as the Scandinavian Mission can  ill afford to do without the means.  No doubt  if the notes are presented for collection at  home, the greater portion at least will be  paid, but if left here, it is very doubtful.  This money was borrowed from amounts  on hand here for emigrations purposes, and,  besides this amount, we have a borrowed  balance from the same source of Kr. 6827.25  or L379.5 "  9 3/4 (about $1845.00)    By this you can judge of our financial  condition, and any disposition you can  make in favor of the mission is greatly need-  ed and will be thankfully received.    Awaiting your favor,  I remain,  Your brother in the Gospel,  Joseph Christiansen  Prest. Scand. Mission 
 Jos. Christiansen  Mar 7 [18]93   
 Wilford Woodruff made remarks of a   similar character. This work cannot stand   still, it must go forward or go backward. 
 Elder W. Woodruff  spoke of the necessity of pruning   the tree off the dead branches from the tree, and those who   would not pay their tithing, did not deserve the fellowship  of the saints, and ought to be cut off 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said the best time for Farmers to pay their tithing   was at the time they raise their produce, before they put it away in their   bins and cellars - 
 Elder Woodruff mentioned an instance in his experience   while with Elder Patten, who on one occasion, when  the people had rejected their testimony—washed their   feet, as a testimony against them; he did know   that God backed up and sustained the testimony of the lessor   priesthood, but the power spoken of in the section just read  he thought was of a more special character, than that   commonly held by ^all^ Elders who go forth to preach the gospel. 
 Elder W. Woodruff bore testimony to the truth of Pres.t. Wells re-  marks—and named an instance of bearing testimony   to a number of individuals, especially one who had once   held the priesthood &c—and apostatized, he was constrained by   the spirit to go and warn him three times, the man was coming   towards him, and fell dead at his feet. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said it was very plain, that the   judgments of God commenced upon the inhabitants   of this wicked world—after the introduction of   the Gospel—especially this and other civilized or   ^Christian^ nations—this is according to all the revelations we have   on the subject. 
 Elder W. Woodruff, said, all the outside world were   united in fighting against Zion—and the great   work of the Almighty God had to be carried out by   the handful of people in these vallies—and if   we have not faith enough as yet, to enter into the   Order of Enock, we surely have sufficient to enter   upon an effort of co operation, like the one suggested.    We are too anxious to get rich as a people, and   get Railroad stock, or Bank stock &c 
  Elder W. Woodruff said he did not believe either ^in^ one or   the other of those doctrines. but he did believe that many   who went in the spirit world, who will receive the Gospel  and enter into the Celestial Kingdom—and moreover   that those who have had one wife sealed to them   over the Alter, and should die before they had a chance   to obtain a second, would certainly be entitled to a   Celestial Glory. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said that while he acted under the Aaronic   priesthood, as a priest, God manifested his power quite as much   as since he held the Apostleship, he gave him dreams and   visions &c, no matter what priesthood a man may hold, if he   magnified it, God would own and bless him under it. 
  Elder W. Woodruff ^said^ that he did not think it wisdom to have our   minds exercised about any matter that revelation was silent upon,  and as to whether or not, the high priesthood was enjoyed   between the time of Moses and the Saviour, did not really   concern us, as we had many pressing duties that should engage   our attention in preference. 
 Elder W Woodruff felt very thankful for the changes that   are now being made, especially in the Temporal affairs of the   Kingdom of God, a vast amount of responsibilites had been   upon the shoulders of Prest Young for a long time as the leading   Spirit of all the great enterprizes in our midst, such as   the Railroad, Zions Coope Merchantile Instn, The Bank &c.  He felt that the Kingdom of God was moving onward at a very   rapid ^rate^, hence the necessity of new offices, and more good   men being called into active service, not only in Temporal   but spiritual things. Was much pleased with the Patriarchal   Ordination being extended to others, to meet the growing wants   of the people. 
 Elder W Woodruff spoke of the drivings and fightings of   the Indians by the Government, the hand of the Lord was   over that people, there is a great work for them to do in   building up Zion & the new Jerusalem, they will certainly   be inspired, and ^receive^ revelations from God, and we who have   come into the Gospel a little before them, and we should   exerciise faith for them, and pray for them. A few days   us after they came into the Vallies, they saw a few Indians   who came to their camp, and they gave them some bread 
 since that time, we have grown and the Lord has blest us,   and the Indians are better fed and clothed than they were.   we have many duties to perform towards the Indians.  God alone is our friend and the Lamanites around us, had   they li not been a portion of the House Indians of Israel   they would have been cut off root and branch long ago  they are of the seed of Joseph, and God requires us to look   after their salvation. He Prophesied in the name of the   name of the Lord Jesus Christ that this Government ^or nation^ was nearly   ripe for the Damnation of Hell. He spoke of the   first Elders of the Church who had been taken away, for a wise   purpose, it was necessary for an organization in this dispensation   behind the vail, he believes that Joseph had lived his time   out until done his work. Let us do right, build up Zion, and   establish the Kingdom. Keep the commandments of God, and no   earthly power can drive us from these vallies. 
 Elder W Woodruff felt satisfied that very many of our people   do not pay their tithing, he kept an account of his money receipts   and the products of the earth, and paid a tenth of each   the law of tithing was of God, and none can neglect it without   suffering loss, it has never been annulled, and has been in   existance ever since the days of Adam, we shall prosper by   Keeping the commandments of God, and visa, versa. 
 Elder W Woodruff said there was a great contrast   between the laws, refered to and the Celestial law   as given through the Gospel, if the eyes of the people   of this City were opened, they would be more alive to   their duties, and would hunger and thirst after righteos-  ness. We are living under great priveleges, and have had   many keys and principles pertaining to the living and the   dead - he denounced the fashions of the Babylon which are so   eagerly sought after by our Wives and Daughters -   We have a great amount of preaching and are more or less   responsible for this privelege.  Many of the Elders are giving way   to Smoking & Drinking &c which he was sorry to see. 
 Elder W. Woodruff  spoke of the opposing element to the priesthood from the days of Joseph until   now, the many excellent traits of character in Prest Young, as coined by his works, the necessity of   wise legislation, by good men, to be of good courage, do right, be faithful and united, then Congress   and her many bills cannot hurt us. 
 Elder W. Woodruff also adverted to the unreliability of memory especially   after a great lapse of time since the sayings had been made   he himself has written a great many sayings and sermons of Joseph   Smith, but when once written they invariably left his memory.    The Lord lead and instructed the Prophet Joseph like a child   and many things he was taught, he had but a very imperfect  understanding at first, his on the resurection changed  somewhat prior to his death. He then traced the principle of progress  in the dealings of God with his people, since the rise of the church   especially in reference to Baptisms for the dead, The calling of Elders   to preach the Gospel &c 
 Elder W. Woodruff has noticed that all Hell had   been opposed to the Priesthood ever since the rise this church   and where is the man whose works speak more favorably   than Pres.t is the man whose works speak more favorably   than Pres.t Young, yet he is not without falt, neither   is any other man perfect, we are called to legislate for   the best interests of the people, we have not got the   light we might have as Apostles, Elders &c — but bring   forward your good men that will guard the liberties of the   people, this is a good place to select them, and he would   vote for them.  This is an important time and we have   got to build up the Kingdom of God, no matter what   Congress may do, nor how many bills they may pass.  Let us reason together, and have the Spirit of God   for we are the only friends that God has got, therefore let   us be faithful and unite together and maintain our   position in these mountains 
 Elder W. Woodruff stated   that inasmuch as Dr Benedich   is a member of the church,   should he not be dealt with   for lying about their his   brethren    He also suggested the   propriety of getting up   a ticket here to night  & Elder Orson Pratt   seconded the suggestion   carried unanimously 
 Elder Woodruff made some remarks about the Municipal Elec-  tion to-day in which he gave his views about those who suffered   their names to stand in oppossition to the expressed wish of the saints   and be voted for by our enemies. 
 Elders John Taylor & W. Woodruff ventilated the subject at considerable length,  showing the absolute necessity of ^for^ a change in our Temporal matters, in order to unite   and bind us together as a community, or we will never have power   among the Nations, this Dispensation comprizes in it, every good principle that   existed in all past dispensations. Celestial Law & Baptism for the dead   were revealed just at the right time, so the Order of Enock comes along   when circumstances that now surround us, demand a change in our   social policy. 
 Prest. Wells & Elder Woodruff each bore testimony to the remarkable   quality of our soil, especially adapted to the growth of wheat, having   tested for a thousand years and received the washings from these mountains,   each gave some timely council to the cultivators of the soil   shewing the necessity of replenishing it I with manure to prevent   its entire exhaustion of the Wheat element, as was the case in some   countries, where wheat used to be grown in great quantitites,   now they cannot grow a bushel, we have in this Territory some   of the choicest virgin soil in the world, but and needs care and culture  to preserve it - 
 Elder W Woodruff  said there never was anything   revealed to this people, as raised the Devil so   universally as this united order  and no one who either acts as Ananias did,   or tries to safe draw off and throw cold water   upon it, ^but^ what little sap there is, will run out of   them. He 
 Mt. Pleasant Utah  June 24 + 1898    President W. Woodruff -  and Councilors  S L City,  Dear Brethren:--    As I did not have the opportunity of seeing you  when I called at your Office last week when I returned  from my mission to Scandinavia's I deem it proper to  write you and give you a brief report of the  Mission and the labor performed there during the last  two years.  During those years there have been on  an average 125 Utah Elders and 4 or 5 natives in  the field and when I left here there were 150.  According to the reports received there has been some 200,000  Families visited by our Elders, and about the same number  of tracts distributed, and over one thousand souls have  been added to the church.  The ages of theElders there averages  from 18 to 73.  We find that the climate in those  northern lands is very trying on our Brethren, especially  on this advanced in years, not so much on account 
 of extreme cold, as on account of the damp and heavy  atmosphere, rain and fog.  We have a number of men  there now past 60 and where they have to take their  chances in the field in common write others it is almost  more than they are able to stand.    The Elders have with scarsely an exception labored dilligently   and with good success and the blessings and power  of god have followed them in their ministry.  We have on  various occasions seen the power of God made manifest  in a remarkable manner.  The sick have been  restored to health where they in some instances had  been lying on their beds of affliction for many years  and to all human appearance there was but little or  no hope for their recovery.-    We have met with but very little interference from  government officials or from the clergy.  Our motto has been  to respect and honor those to whom honor was due, and  to observe the laws of the countries where we were laboring  and exercise love and charity for all and malice toward  none, hence we have been treated ^with^ courtesy and respect.  On One or two occasions some of our Elders were banished  from Denmark, this was done on complaints centered  by the Ministers of the State Church who thought they  were annoying them by their presence.-- 
 under those circumstances we have simply transfered  them to Sweden or Norway.    Some 300 have emigrated from that mission during  the past two years, and nearly all on money sent them  by their friends in Utah.  The fact that we have been  instructed not to encourage Emigration, but rather  encourage the Saints to remain and help to build up and  strengthen the branches of the Church where they are  has proven a great benefit to our work in those  lands, as the good Saints who live exemplary lives are  among our very best missionaries    We have encouraged the Saints everywhere, although  poor, to pay their tithing, and we have heard many  enspiring testimonies from them how the Lord has  made good His promises and blessed them as a reward  for their faithfulness.  The people in Scandinavia  do not seem to be so hospitable as are the people of  the U S hence our Elders find it very difficult  to travel without money, but as a rule the manager  to get along with a little.  The general feeling and  Spirit among the people is more liberal and tolerant  then years go, and the prejudin so strong and  pronmuced against us in early days, is much  modified.  One great drawback to our work in 
 the cities is the want of suitable, and I may say   respectable, places where to hold our religious services  we have encouraged a bettering of conditions in that  line.  We have in all the Conferences and in many  of the principle branches, good choirs provided with  organs, and they are a great help to our work,  but we have been much in need of men of talent  in that line. -    The Gospel is more and more attracting the attention  of the more intelligent and better classes of the people  and there is at present an exellent prospect for  the work in Scandinavia.  I am not enclined to  share in the sentiment often expressed by our  Elders: that the harvest is over and we are but  gleaning, but rather think that the precious seed  sown in our day will yet bear a rich harvest -  The mission was a few years ago involved in  a heavy debt, part of that was canceled by Prest  P. Sundwall, my predecessor, and I am pleased  to be able ^now^ to report the mission out of debt and in  a good footing financially as well as otherwise. 
 #2    Elder George Christensen, who has been by your appointed  to take charge of the mission temporarly, has labored  with me in the office for the past two years, part  of the time as writer and translator for the danish  Star, and has rendered me very valuable assistance,  he is a young man of exceptional abilities, and well  qualified for the position he now fills. -   We are also publishing a Star in the Swedish  language, of which Elder Geo, A. Brandt of Salina  is the writer and translator. -    Personally I feel pleased to return to my family  friends at home, and find all well --.    My mission has been full of interest and  experiences to me and I trust it has been of course  profit to the work of God and the people among where  I have labored.    Hoping that this brief Statement may take the place of  a personal report and be thus accepted by you    I have the honor to subscribe myself--    Your Brother in the Gospel  C. N. Lund    over 
 P. S. I here inclose financial Statement -  You will see that although this notes in  your Office is connected in our favor.  Should they be worthless, we are not relying  upon them, we can throw them all out if  necessary and be on the square anyhow.  but likely something will be realized from  them.  Lund -    Excellent report.

Björkman, who died ^in^ 19 inst. at Solvarbo,  Sweden, Chaving now received full particulars, we deem it  proper to forward same to you. A full account of  his labors, death and burial has been sent to his family.    Elder Andrew Björkman was born in Björklinge, Upland,  Sweden, Jan. 22, 1838. ^He^ Rreceived the Gospel, by Baptism, May 18, 1864,  and emigrated to Utah in 1869. He arrived here as a  Missionary, June 29, 1895, and was appointed by Pres. Sunduvall  to labor in Stockholm Conference. His field of labor was  Solvarbo Branch in Dalarne, where he, in connection with  Elder Lennberg, has performed a good work, laboring  there until death call him hence.    A day or two before his death he separated from Elder  Len^n^berg, making an appointment to meet him a few days  later. Elder Björkman remained in Solvarbo to prepare  the report of the Branch to be forwarded to Stockholm.    On the 19th of Aug, he seemed to be in his usual health  and partook of dinner with the family of Saints with   whom he was staying. After dinner he went with them  into the field where the work of harvesting was going on.

Hastening to his side, they  found him apparently lifeless, and all attemp^t^s to  arouse him proved in vain. A physician was then sum-  moned who after a brief examination, pronounced him  dead, ^and gave as the cause a bursting of a bloodvessel in the head,^ stating that death had come without pain.    As Solvarbo is located in a sparsely settled and  mountainous region some 130 miles from Stockholm, means  of communication are very primitive, and two days lapsed  before the Saints could find his partner, Elder Lennberg,  who, when found, wired the sad news to Stockholm and  thence it was forwarded here. A letter was sent from  here to the Office at Liverpool, containing the news; but  we waited for further particulars before sending the   word home, as we did not know where he died, nor  the address of his family, or whether word had been  sent to them from Sweden. Further particulars could  not be had here until the Brethren from Stockholm reached  the scene of his death, which necessarily consumed considerable  time. Upon receipt of the first news from Solvarbo we  wired you, and having just now received a complete  account of the death and funeral, forward you same.    As soon as Bro. Ahlquist, President of Stockholm Conference,  and the Elders with him arrived, necessary steps were imme-  diately taken for the funeral, Temple clothing having been prepared

At 4 o'clock, Aug. 25 1896 the funeral services  were commenced, a congretation of about 200 persons, mostly strangers,   having gathered in to pay their last respects to Bro. Björkman.  The services were conducted as on such occassions at home.   The speakers were Elders C. A. Ahlquist, O. E. Olson, A.  Petersen and E. Lennberg, all from Zion, who all spoke  feelingly of the excellent qualities of the deceased, and  bore powerful testimonies to the large assembly.    After the dedicatory prayer had been offered by Pres.  Ahlquist, the mortal remains of Elder Björkman were  consigned to the silent tomb. He lies buried in a  lovely spot in the Gustafs Cemetery in Dalarne, Sweden.  Much credit is due to Pres. Ahlquist and the Brethren  with him, who did all in their power that Brother  Björkman might be laid to rest in a proper man-  ner, befitting a servant of God.    While we would ^have liked^ very much ^had^ liked to have been present  at the funeral of our Brother, the information as to  where he died, and where and when he would be  buried, did not reach us in time, the distance from  here being some over 500 miles, and we felt sure that  that the Brethren who were there would do all that could  be done.    It is very sad that one of our brethren should thus

 President W. Woodruff. I desire to make a   few remarks, with the President's permission. The  ordinance of washing of feet was introduced by  Joseph associated with the School of the Prophets;  there was also a washing of feet connected with  the endowments given in the Kirtland Temple  which was continued until the time the Saints  left there. In Nauvoo, he introduced the  endowments we are receiving to-day.    I agree with President Taylor's views with  regard to our giving endowments. I do think  we should be more cautious and careful who  we receive into our Endowment House to give  them full endowments. With regard to giving  a portion thereof, and then letting candidates  prove themselves worthy before receiving the  rest, that of course is a matter to be left to  Prest. Taylor. I do not believe, however, that  a man should be allowed to go into that  house who does not pay tithing, and who  drinks and curses and swears.    President Taylor. And breaks the Sabbath day    President Woodruff. Yes, sir; a man who breaks  the Sabbath day has no business there. 
 1883-09-28    President W Woodruff: I want to say to  the First Presidency that we have  been together as a quorum since this  mornings meeting except for one hour.  We have had a free and full talk  upon our individual affairs--upon  our family matters, thupon the word of  wisdom, the duties and responsibilities  that devolve upon us as apostles &c.  And we have come to the conclusion  that we will now fully observe the Word  of Wisdom as we have all more or less  been negligent upon that point, that we  will conduct our personal lives and the 
 affairs of our families in a more  consistent manner in the future ^and^ in  conformity with our calling and  high profession as apostles of the  Lord Jesus Christ.  ThatWe have examined  into the reported crimniality of Brother  Carrington while in England, and have  had a full explanation from him of  those matters, and find there is no  criminality to be attached to him yet he  was very unwise and imprudent in his  course while abroad which might have  havegiven cause for grave suspicions.    Bro Carrington ^is^ also convinced that his conduct  was not such as became consistent with  his calling as an apostle.    Bro John W Young has also expressed his  desires to more fully live up to the requirements 
 of his religion and to magnify his  calling. Hence we have  passed upon and accepted each of  the members of our quorum who have  been with us dto day and now  present, and now submit ourselves  and our action for the consideration of  the First Presidency. 
 ^Apostle^ W. Woodruff, Endorsed ^the^ teachings of  President Taylor. Felt a change was  coming on the church and ^on^ the   world spoke of ^the greatness of^ coming events  for which a people had to be prepared,  and that revelation would be given to  fit us for the work, and to stand in  the midst of the judgments, or else we  go down with the rest ^of the world^. We ought to  wake up, and ^get our^our hearts set upon the  building up of the Kingdom of God. Then 
 President W. Woodruff said this meeting  had been called for a purpose that would  hereafter be revealed. It would require  the brethren to keep their own council.  There are ordinances in this house that are  sacred and should not be revealed. All the  ordinances are sacred, and we must learn  to keep our own councils.    A note was then taken not to reveal any thing 
 there would be no lack of means. Felt  like Pres. Taylor there would have to be a   change in the giving of endownments.  Refd where prayer of Joseph and the answer  hereto ^to be found in the Book of Doctrine & Covenants,^ with its complete fulfillment. ^He continued,^ I believe  that this priesthood has power with the  heavens, Our man power-slaves Some  called us slaves, why do we submit to  our leaders, because we know what they  are controlled of God and empowered by  him; we are no more slaves, than it  could be consistintly said that Gabriel,  Michael & other ^angels^ are slaves to God. in The  priesthood will prevail, as the world will  find out. God has not stopped giving  revelation; Revelation regarding work  in the temples for our dead &c When  Israel rises up ^& lives their religion^ then we shall not  have trouble about glory [shaps] &c 
 that should transpire in our meeting.,  which was carried unanimously.    Prest Woodruff said that the time had  come for us to enter a higher plane and  to understand the further ordinances of  the Kingdom of God. He asked if there  was any present who had not obeyed  and entered into the law of God (plural  marriage).    There wasere none present who had not en-  tered into this covenant.    Prest Woodruff then gave instructions upon  the necessity of keeping the Word of Widsom  and to k.eep their ^of preserving order in our^ families. in order ^He urged the brethren to^ To be   kind to their families and just in all  their relations with their wives and fam  iles. We should all obey the law of  Tithing and observe all the law of  God, acting consistently in all our doings  gave instructions on the Word of Wisdom  the necessity of observing it in its full  spirit and meaning, showing the  necessity of overcoming all our bad  habits and to be ^of being^ obedient to the require  ments of the Almighty.  Spoke of the  necessity of our advancing in the  Knowledge of God and the principles  of eternal life and ^of^tokeep^ing^ oursel-  ves pure and virtuous 
 President Woodruff then gave instructions  and stated the effects that had follow-  ed this ordinance. Spoke upon the shaking  off the dust off the feet and washing the  feet in pure water in wsummer or winter and  the judments of God that had followed    Referred to a revelation that he had had  in the wilderness and exhorted the bretheren  to dilligence and faithfulness 
 President W. Woodruff had not said  anything about the school of the Pro-  phets intending to have asked the bre-  thren of their standing, but as it  had been spoken of he would say  there had been an attempt to es-  tablish a school of the prophets  but men could not keep their own  council, they betrayed their trust 
 Prest Woodruff spoke of the difficulties  existing in families and difficulties  that we could not always controle in  our families as we could wish and  unless there was something very serious  we should have some charity and  gave some very excellent council.  bore testimony concerning the integ-  rity of Bro Bleak 
 It is necessary to have men who  can keep the law of God and livee  their religion, being exemplary men  and true to thier covenants    Apostle Teasdale felt truly thankful to God  for this privilege of meeting with the  brethren in this room. In the past it  has seemed impossible to keep our own  counsels some one would betray, but we  ought surely to know to keep our coven  ants, our own counsels, God will not  teach us in these schools unless we keep  these things to ourselves for they are sacred  We must honor the law of God.  We are  surely slothful if we have been in the  church for some time and have not  obeyed the law of plural marreage.  We  must have order in our families—bretheren  be candid speak your feelings freely,  preach the gospel by example. ^Let us^ love   each other as ourselves, not speak evil  against the Lord's anointed, exercise  righteous dominion over our families  and God's heritage, and overcome and  keep the whole law of God. Theory will  not exalt us, hold each others interest  sacred, live so as to keep ourselves  clean, and be prepared for the revela-  tions of God who has promised to  reveal himself.

 Pres 3 Woodruff was glad to see this day and  time. ^He^ expressed great satisfaction at seeing  these brethren making the sacrifices they  are making. Instructed the brethren to come  together on the morrow in fasting and in pray-  er, with clean bodies and garments to have  no intercourse with their wives. We have heard  you express yourselves. you have ganied a  great victory in overcoming your habits &c. The  Lord requires us to keep the Word of Wisdom accor  ding to the best of our ability.

He had taken up a labor  with himself for the time has come for us to  keep the word of wisdom as far as we can before  the Lord. Come together at 9 am, &c 
 school in Salt Lake it is the only one  at present.  Before I left in conversing  with President Taylor I was permitted to  organize a school at St. George, by for-  warding athe list of names to him for the  approval of the Presidency.  Plural mar-  riage and the word of Wisdom were  two important principles to be observed  in order to stand in this holy order.    He then called for an expression of the feel-  ings and status of the bretheren present  Bp. Marius Ensign had tried to live these prin  ciples and was in harmon with and rejoiced  in these principles and the privilege of this  meeting. 
 The brethren then retired to behind  the veil and were introduced by Prest  Snow to Prest Wilford Woodruff who  stood on the steps beside the stand  with uplifted hands    Prest Woodruff, "Art thou brethren? I  salute you in the name of the Lord  Jesus Christ, in token or rememberance  of the Everlasting covenant, in which  covenant I receive you to fellowship, in  a determination that is fixed, im-  movable, and unchangeable, to be  your friend and brother through the  grace of God, in the bonds of love,  to walk in all the commandments  of God blameless, in thanksgiving,  for ever and ever, Amen."    Prest Snow replied "Art thou a brother?  We salute you in the name of the  Lord Jesus Christ  &c &c as above 
 The brethren were then listed by age  President Woodruff then laid aside  his coat & vest, and girded himself  with a towell. All things being pre  pared, John Lytle, who was the  oldest man present, being born on  the 18th day of August 1803, then  took his seat and President W.  Woodruff washed his feet. He said  "By virtue of the Holy Priesthood  and in the name of Jesus Christ I  wash thy feet according to an  Holy ordinance introduced by our  Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ with  his disciples when he washed their  feet, and told them to wash one 
 anothers, and also by Joseph  Smith, the Prophet of the Lord,  an introductory ordinance to  the school of the Prophets, and  pronounce thee clean from the  blood of this generation, and  say unto thee, thy sins are for-  given thee, and ^I^ seal and con-  firm upon thee all the rights,  powers and privileges associated  with this ordinance in the author  ity of the Holy Presthood and  the name of the Lord Jesus Christ  Amen  Then ^Prest Woodruff then^ dried his ^Brother Lytle's^ feet whilset fresh
