"It has been said that Buchanan was in his dotage &amp; feeble in mind which was the cause of his course towards Utah &amp; many other acts of his Administration but this is not the case, he is just as much of a man now as he ever was in his life and it was the first time He ever was in a situation to fully carry out the evil designs of his heart, and his acts are carrying out his principles. E R Young said that the Judges in this Territory would not have taken the course they did if they had not Believed the President would have sustained them  in it.

President Young said in speaking of the Temple  to Jackson County in 7 years I said Amen but if we go back  in that time we shall have to hasten to get our temple Built I chink we must commence it next spring, uncover the founda all over the foundation, For Brother Raleigh appears as though he wished to destroy that Temple He would not take Brother  Angels levil which He had got up with great care and he would not trust to his own Judgment but got Brother Fox to help him get the levil. But Raleigh made one himself and he made the foundation not levil &amp; in order to levil up the last tier he put under small stones which would all crush-  that Building would crack it from top to Bottom I have had much trouble with masons upon this subject, and it  is strange to see this spirit manifest among our leading masons I should be glad to see the day when all men who profess to be saints will impart what knowledge they possess to each other I do not know as Brother Raliagh realizes what He is doing but it appears to me that He is trying to destroy the Architecture of that Building.
