But Raleigh made one himself and he made the foundation not levil and in order to levil up the last tier he put under small stones which would all crush- edbeneath the building and one quarter of an inch setling of that Building would crack it from top to Bottom I have had much trouble with masons upon this subject, and it  is strange to see this spirit manifest among our leading masons I should be glad to see the day when all men who profess to be saints will impart what knowledge they possess to each other I do not know as Brother Raliagh realizes what He is doing but it appears to me that He is trying to destroy the Architecture of that Building.
