And did not mentionthat he would be absent throughthe evening. I left when I gotready. He was in bed whenI returned and arose to letme in chiding me for not tellinghim that I was going awayDoubtless his mood to day originatedin this insident. he probablyeither blames me for not tellinghim that I was going out at thesame time that I had not beenin the store an hour during theday or he thinks I blamehim for leaving without in timeacting is to me and hence 
 [UPSIDE DOWN]Mr Mullen, an acquaintance waskind enough to favor me with anintroduction to his sister to MissLyon and to Miss McKinsley, bywhich good fortune I was enabled to pass the night pleasantlyI returned to Town in the morninghighly gratified with an entertainmentwhich had cost me so little emb--arrasment and left me this sideup.The evening of Jan 10th I spentat Mrs Coles. Misses Catharine and Dorothea entertaining withall possible good will. We toldeach others fortunes.

 [UPSIDE DOWN]Friday ensuing the first of Jan. 7I went up to Doles. in companywith Horace Blinn, WilliamWarren and Smith to attenda Ball in honor of the GloriousEighth. The company was largeand quite miscellaneous The object appeared to be. The great--est possible quantity of Amusementestimated by the greatest grossamount of dancing squeezed outof the occasion, and it wasattained, for during the Twelvehours I remained there. There was no cessation of hop skipand jump excepting the hourallotted to supper.No hearts I believe were lost thoughthere was a good deal of flow ofsoul. There might indeed havebeen some exchanged made- 
 [UPSIDE DOWN]In the course of the ensuing weekI changed my place of boarding tothe Table of my friend Mr IrishI was induced to do so partly on accordof my conveniencce, but mainly becauseI was pleased with the dociety of thefamily. My Irish did not wishboarders but took me out of regardfor my wishes And perhaps be-cause he did not choose to deny myrequest He said "there seems to be a perfect understanding betweenyou and Mrs Irish" And I accepted of his a place at his Table becauseI had then pressed the matterto far to recede. I have sinceregretting this step for I fancythat I am considered as actingupon the principle that "It isuseless to have a friend unless weuse him." 
 [UPSIDE DOWN]Jan 1 1837New Year happened on SundayF. M. Irish came the the Storeand proposed going to Church withme And to this singular circumstancewas added another, still more surprising,in the fact that Mr Smith mypartner offered to join us! And weall went to the Court House andheard Elder Bennett from N.Y.but Alas poor Smith! he wasso stricken in conscience for hispresumption that he found no peaceuntill he made atonement at theDutchmans Coffe House.I passed the evening at the house of Mrs Coles mostly in the company of Catharine & Dorothea.

 Written along right side edge going down the page:  Page  A B C D E F G H ISon Wilfordhaving some few things layingupon my mind in addition to what I havealready exspressed to you in this little book& feeling that it is the only way in which I canliberate my mind so as to enjoy comfortablecomfortable feelings I will further say, thataltho I do not calcute to notice so as to lay upevery little trivial circumstance which mayBarn Iasiah      2receive from time to time in a casual mannerwhich are not according to the principle ofrighteousneys.  Yet permit me to say in thespirit of love & Christian charity that I do,Company Mill     1stCrittenden Amos   bRowler Qust           b& shall exspect, to notice those deviations fromthe path of restitude which are calculated intheir nature to produce unhappiness of mind& uncomfortableness of body, especially when 
 80a design is evidently connected with a dailyperformance of the same for it is indeedmy manner to judge of things accordingto this rule, but I do not wish Wilfordto make you any additional trouble orgive you any feelings of an unpleas-ent nature, & due it not that I doconcider it a duty I owe to are to myselfto open my mind to you in regardto some things relating to some portionof the treatment I have received sinceI have been journeying with you aswell as to the cause of truth. I wouldnot disturb your mind with these purp-lexing things, I am confident you arenot aware of things which do really exist& that you would not approve of themfor if I believed otherwise I should regretcoming, for I cannot believe that it is thewill of God I should ^suffer^ just such things asthro this I may be called to suffer greaterones, I have, & I do exspect to become asharve with you not only in the comr 
 common blessings of life, such as food & rainment, but also in the privations & hardships which you may be called in the providence of God to pass through which journeying to the place of our destinationBut, when on a certain day we were journeying & it had got be noon and I felt quite faint& you had stopped, to feed your cattle, I waited a good while to have some one introduce the sating some bread & milk but,the next day I thought I would notwait again, for I was sure it couldnot make any difference as one & another were getting milk to drinkso I said I would eat a little break& milk for I felt the need of it, soMiss King helped me to the same& asked Phebe which she should get the last nights milk or mornings, & she replied, the skim,d milk, I was astonished, as I knew they had allas it were been drinking milk all the morning & new milk too, but I never 
 drink any myself & I felt that it was truly hard that I must be deniedthe privilege of a little good milk & I said, why, you exspect I suppose[ illegible]your new milk eat or I should [illegible]it was better to have the poorest drand, & the best meat & that for mypart I had a peculiar preference to new milk  Why said Miss K.this is good milk, I dipped it out & I ate it, but exspressed feelings of not entire satisfaction & Phebe says, we have calculated for a generalthing to use our nights milk first so that we can get some cream from the best I could not understand how they could raise cream while the milkwas in the waggon, so I enquired ofher, & I also knew that the new milk had been eaten & drank every after I came here, & she finally said, Why no, we don't exspect to set our milk for butterin the day time, & so it ended leaving 
 me as much in the dark as when I(Gillet Samuel - 1Giddings Linus - 3)commenced the inquiry.  I mustsay, I was tried, a day or two after thisbecoming way faint before anyone spoke of eating & as you had stopped, I got some milkto eat, I helped your father to some also &(Hurd Willson  strane as it may (Hart Beaulah)appear there seemed to be a dissatisfaction in Phebes mind on account of the liberty taken, tho nothing was said in regard to new milk or old milk for I think it was mixed together, but while father & I waseating something was said about her eating some & ^she^ replied that she had beenwaiting for others to get through, why said I Phebe need you wait for me so long as I bring my own dishes & bread, she replied that we could not all eat at once & this Idid not then, nor do I now comprehend, the next thing that presented itself in regardto milk was that as Sarah had been 
 Dear Sonhaving some few thingslaying on my mind in addition twhat I have already exspressed to yI will further say, that altho I do nofeel disposed to notice every littletrivial occurrence which may, haor shall, hereafter occur in a unusalmanner, & yet permit ^me^ to say, that I do think I have not myself beentreated in some respects according to justice & judgement since I have been in your said midst  I will however say that I do exspect so long as you Iremain with you to become a sharer in all the varied sanes which a wiled omnipotent hand shall see fit to call us unto whether it be in adversity or prosperity,in privation & want, or in a state of plenty.But I do feel that as you have takenas your Parents with also with the intention of providing for us the 
 that daughter Phebe should feeldisposed to turn me off with a piece of oldbread for supper which was so hard that I would not give it[ illegible] to Wilford to eat (as he asked me just before to give him some).& especially since I gave what I had the night before to the family being enough for thier mealsfor my family & it was very light, tender &good too, & Wilford, I did want it, tho, all the fussI made about it, was, that I went to the [pandor]by & helped myself to some new bread, saying meantime, that I had ^no^ notion of accepting ofsuch hard bread in exchange for that which was tender & good, & now I will say, that I could nothave done less than I did without being made really afflicted with hard feelings such as Ido not like to feel 
 entrusted with the care of the smilkPhebe preposed in my presence that Sariah shouldshould be called on to dip out milk for every one who wanted G I think, I remarked to herthat I thought there might be ^*at the time^ some execpt-ions to that rule ^for, indeed I was wanting some^ with out destroying theorder of the same for indeed I felt, at oncethat I should never be conformed to a rulelike that, which living with my children &especially when I was as competent to notonly to dip out ^milk^ with as great carefulnessas any one but also to make & take enough butter in quite as orderly a manner yetwas fucrueted by Sahab, but I was at oncethat Phebe intended to suffer any no exceptto the rule as she said it would be of no useto establish such a rule unless it was closlyadharied to by every individual, but for my partI felt that it might be necessary for the familyin general, especially for men & children at theparticular ones were not subjugated & now Iwill say to you that I have not practiced it all sincethe time of calling on Sarah for milk & I will I ever of all 
 more butter ^at^ a meal usually than yourfather has formu  enoumy reasons.  In the first place Iconsidered it as unsaint like, & in the next asunchild like to require me todoso, & in the thirdplace, I was sure that I should not enjoy anythingin mind if I felt obliged to conform to a rulelike this, I should feel it ^to^ be wrong & onlyintly should have hard feelings I this Ido not like to feel towards any friend &besides, just look at the necessity of yourMother being conformed, or subjectto such a rule, when the only time I shouldhave occasion to call on Sarah is at night& then I am almost surrounded with newMilk in our Tent every pan just alikeexcept there should be one not quite as fullas the rest, & in this case, I am sure to knowwhich it is without going to Sarah but nowWilford you will see at once that you need notmuch disestorment to see that your Mother isrequired to take a lower seat than yoursevants, for she is denied privilege that 
 enterested with the can of themilkPhebe proposed in my busines that Sariah thatthey do enjoy, for Sarah of course   foreverycan have the frivilege of getting milk when& where, & as much as she pleases nowI do think it a little curious, that whenyou do have such an abundance of milk& every one who wishes can drink it whenthey please, & as I do not drink any at all, butonly want the privilege of eating a littlewith bread, at night as well as at noon,since itis the case, that Ido not take butvery little supper, of course want a little ongoing to bed, a thing which I have preach-ed a good many years. when I hadmilk & when I had not, a little of something else, I say, I do think it curious thatI should be this restricted in regard tothis privilege & in a special manner asas I have eat but so very little buttersince I have been journeying, & I am surethat my family have not disposed of 
 more butter ^at^ a meal usually than yourfather has formerly made use himself, but,enough about the aitute, milk, & I will leave this sub-ject by saying that I do concider it the most anaccountable thing that Pheby, mind should beled to such a course of treatment towards me un-less it be a trade in her disposition for I can say intruth, that I came with all her friendly feelingstowards her, which are necessary to treat onewith every due isprest, & I designed in myheart to be to her as a Mother, the same as toCunice Savr, that I did not calculate, asshe has a number of children, that Ishould ^not^ be able to assist in the taking caseof children, neither did I think it necessaryas she was well provided for with help, & Icannot think Wilford that there was anythingin my demeanour towards Phebe that couldpossibly be the occasion of such treatment as I havein many other instances (which I have notnamed) viewed from her hand for indeedthere has been many things tho small in theirnature which have been extremely mortisfying 
 74  to my feelings.  & such things as I have[heuting you] been an entire stranger unto,The uncommeitating spirit manifestedby Mis King in regard to cooking [illegible] does Ithink bear testimony to the degree of resect bywhich I am held, in her estimation ^th them^ & now I^& family^ will say, that after all, as much as I sat by thisarticle milk the principle manifested in thepresence of strangers have wieghed more inmy mind than all the rest, but anothersmall thing I will just name which hurt myfeelings at the time we had occasion to tarryover night away from our provisions a littlebefore you came, Phebe, in reply to my sayingI did not know what we should do in regardto supper, asked if I had not some bread, Itold her I had a few biscuit she said we wouldtake them & they would make us some inthe morning if I insisted on it.  The next day thatnight as we had not our bread baked for supp to& Miss King had got hers done & cooked I saidto Phebe that I should like to get some of themfor supper she says, will but as I turnedto go into the tent where the bread was sheenjoined there is a piece of old bread thatought to be eaten first!

Another thing I willState which I think may be a samplel of them isrepresentations which have existed between usyou will recollect of milking a little one daat noon for your Joseph & I partook with himwas the manner in which Phebe interdlivedthe thing to you, caused me to feel ashamedof myself she says Wilford Mother wanted alittle new milk I could not avoid saying thatPhebe designed to have some for Joseph & I said 
 that I should like a little warm milkshould they be at the trouble to milk sometho, I had no Idea of having any, & Pheb saysyou can have some Mother, I thought her very good but, did not think it fair her putting the matter in such a light, for indeed it is not my principle nor never was my disposition to require such attentions, tho, I think theremay have been some excatisons to make it appear that I have been selfish, a trial which I have never before been accused of & it is my opinion, that if you Wilford have any feelings inyour breast, that I have [illegible] in my daily conduct or conversation, from the froth of rectitude, or wisdom, since I have been in yourmidst, It must be ^either^ from a course of such misrepresentations as was manifest in regard to the milk or of a similar nature, or perhaps in connections with some thingsof a grosser nature from others, or from the factthat you & I differ in jugment in respect to what is right & wrong, you may perhapsthink I lay too much stress upon the mannerof Phebes speaking to you as she did about the  
 Milk, but, just look at the subject for one moment & concider what your viewssould have been without an explanation, &tho, the thing in itself concidered was smallyet it is easy to be seen that great thingsmight come from it, for instance, that shee was really disposed to make it appear toyour mind that your Mother was very difficult, notional, & selfish, what better evidence could she want to present to yourmind, than the fact, that your Mother required the privilege of having a cowmilked at noon, that she might be accom-modated with new & warm milk, certainly thereis no one but would concider it an unreason-able requirement. Well, did not the languagePhe used, convey the Idea in full that I requiredthis privilege, most certainly it did, but afterall it could not be said in truth that I askedsuch a thing, altho, I said, to be sure aftershe told me of her intended to have some milked for Joseph, that I should likesome good warm milk very well, my-self - But one thing I will suggest, that  
 I have ^had^ newly much occasion of forMatrimonythought upon since I have been with you vis, that of having some rule, or somewhatsaid, whereby I might know what,& where, such provisions were that you exspected me & my family to share with you in, for indeed I have thought strangethat Phebe did not, (unless she had heard you give the invitation,) just say, Mother here is this, that & the other perhaps some beans, a little rice, Pork &c, which we shall exspect you to help yourselves to, as you like, but nothing of this sorthas been said to me at any time the first  I knew about any Beans Phebe gives dir-ections to have some cooked for her fami-ily, I felt in a particular manner as if I shouldlike some to cook, but nothing was said, tilla day or two I then to her that I shouldlike some beans to cook also. Shereplied, you know where they are 
 which was the first knowedge I hadof the beard any way suffice it to say thenI cooked some (soon after this ground therewas rice on board by their making somepudding of it. but not one word hadbeen said to me abut helping myself& family, but I do think Wilford that itis me more than propper if you expectI wish your Parents to share with ^you^ in thecomforts you have to give them a generalinvitation to help them set up & that tooin the presence of your family for indeedthere is no one, but would feel delicatein my situation but feel delicate to havefor things in the persence of strangers ina special manner but you ^may^ be as sendthat if Phebe had asked as great excitingones taken me helpers to the comforts oflife as she has to keep them from me. Ishould not have wanted for any thingI do think as you assay. to provide for yourParents on this occasion, that it is no more ^than^propper I should have the privilege of havingchange of so great as have of the Meth as 
 impression from that Betsay 63Bedfore I came here was full of remarksagainst the principles of the church& that you could not nor would not havesuch things, well, I thought it ratherstrange that Betsay should exerciseso little wisdome, but I determinedto speak to her on the subject & I didso but she seemed astonished, I saidshe could not remain ^any^ at first of one wordbeing said on the subject, but finally she saidshe did recollect that ^on^ a certain occasion a fewwords was exchanged in some what of a [tarfline]character, by way of argument which amounted tonothing as it were, but it was spoken openlyin a more said or thought about it as she knewI was convienced that whoever was instrumentalof making such [illegible]  pression on yourmind was strangely out of the way, but dutycalls me to you ^she also^ of the incident which took placeyesterday morning between Phebe and Betsey, Phebecame in while we were all about dressing & theyas is very common was cleaning the bed afterI was & bring close by Betsey she happened to 
 throw some of her bigmeared thingsonto Betseys bed or to her & Betsey, saysto her (as she afterwards informed me)I wish you would not throw your dirtycloaths onto me & as I do not want besmeardthings under my nose, always, This shesaid she had often exspressed to Mary & she would care nothing about it but on thisoccasion Phebe being resent her grit was stirred, & she spoke very short & harshly to Betsey& threw spring, out to in of her being so part-icular tha no one might touch her thingsBetsey insisted that she had done no morethan to tie up her bed for the sake of convinience & to keep it as desent as possibly & alsoto have a plan to lay other things onto &Phebe said, you will throw other peoplesthings about, but this Betsey denied a Phebesaid she had been told so, Betsey then askedthe girls if they had told her such things& they all at one denied telling any suchthing, but Betsey heard, Phebe sying to Maryyou did tell me that Betsey threw off at acertain time some shitten clouths you puton her bed three times over but Mary said shecould remember one such thing, of coursethe great accersation against Betsey was whenthe girls threw shitten cloaths on her bed, that she 
 took the liberty to throw them off, & Betseysfeelings on regard to this subject is similar tomine viz that  that the more careful we areto keep our things orderly the better it will be fortheir company in general - more I do not knowof but one thing that Phebs can with anyperprinty bring up against me & that is nothingat all in one sense, but one day, as little Phebeoders an too, I think come in to the Tent withsome greasy rituals in their hands butBetseys bed was tied up & any convinientto sit down on they took seats on it & as shewas absent I felt it duty to call them as I didthat they shouldnot sit with their rituals on& and Betseys bed, & added, you should neversit down on other peoples bed, wondering thatI was talking to children but just at thatmoment Phebe came in & I can assure youthat she took me to do at a great rate I told herthat I was one of the last persons that everpractised any [patirulanslief] that would come in con-trol with any ones comfort or happinessthat I concidered on this occasion that I wastalking to childre, but all did not do, but I dowonder if Phebe thinks that after all the childrenI have taken care of both of our own & Br Ozuns 
 to go to school, &c I concidering my poorhealth, as also the abundance of help she has for the taking care of children, that I came here with the exspectation of having ansort of care of her children, I have thoughtfa good while that if any of my sisters shouldie & leave young children that I should not feel it duty to do anything about taking carof them, but last of all, I must say that I never in my whole life avoided viewed myself soThankfully treated, as she treated me thismorning, as the girls were going to wash I told father to present his shirts, as I was not able to do more than wash my own[ illegible]& tho I might sometimes wash my nightdress 2 shimms & as for Betsey, I have neverexpected she would do my washing for shehad not been able to do more than her own for a good while past, I also had a sheet on my bed which was got very dirty in the wet weather & sheet I spoke at being washed, & Phebe hearing athe waggon sent for Mary & told her they might wash fathers cloaths, but no more  I went to the carriage & said to her, that there is a very dirty sheet on my bed, which I was u[n]able to wash, butshe gave me understand no washing but father would be done & after saying I thought there was ple 
 of help to do it & she says, how great help.I replyed, that when she was at our house in Farmington & I had one wash woman, which came once in two weeks to wash for me & I had her do your washing, Phebe replied, she did not do my clothing, for I did it myself & a great deal more when I want able hardly, to sit upPhebe, said &, you did not do your washing at least not a great deal of it, you might have done your childs, will you give me the lie Mother [illegible] she, Phebe said I, I know what I said to you on the subject, for I told you that you need not undertake to wash at all, that Mrs Stone would do it tho if you were[ illegible]you might do your diapers, & I do know that Wilford heard me on some occasions tell you not do do it, you might however done somepart of it, but as for your doing the whole &much more washing any of my cloaths you never did it Phebe, she then comes up & in the presence of Miss King, says, & besides that, I had to take care of my child when I want hardly able to get up, & you never pretended to take it up or take any notice of it good heavens said I Phebe I was in a glorious good state to be able to give special time to the taking care of my child when I had been worn down to the quick by being up nights & upon a[ illegible]thro the daytime on account of Ex extreme 
 69   sickness & at the time you were hereI had quite a number in my family to cook for ^ wait upon & no soul to helpme except as Wilford having some compas-sion on me & some of the feelings of achild offered to wash my dishes for meonce & again while you was seated in thefront chamber a working of muslin.but to sum it up I could hardly get a chanceto put in ^a^ word edgeways,  I tell you what I think about Phebe & mr Wilford & feelings,such a spirit towards me as it evident shehas a very bad ^one^ towards me, it is becausethat when we arrived at Nauvoo, I found Eunwith a babe of a week old, that I did notinstead of helping her & taking care of herbabe when they were not able even to hire anurse go into your room & wait on her child-ren & herself & be ready to &do anything that mightcome in my way & let Eunice go & her fam-ly, go but on the whole I more believe that thegreat mistery is contained in this that she isnot pleased with our coming in the wayhave, I should like to manifest the the if[illegible]& tember of mind she exspressed to metwo different reasons & the control betweenown sentiments she said to me I told W I thoughtMother was sick but she does more work thanI could a day or two after she says I wish youwould take a little more care & take some burdensoff from me

 Son Wilford as I have a few things which I wish to communicate to you & having no opportunity but by my pen, I improve the same, but I can assure you, it is not a very delightful task to either speak, think, or write upon the subject which has for the most part lain heavy upon my mind, eversince my arrival at Nauvoo but more particularly since I joined the Camp of the Saints, most confidently do I believe that that there is not a woman on the earth who can claim the aphellation of a wife whose feelings are [illegible] susceptible of kindness or [illegible] by a companion, nor one who is under more universally miserable [illegible] neglected or an[ illegible ] kind treatment than her,  was had the honor to be recounted your Mother neither do I believe there is any one who has been called & ever 
 88the days of the ancient Apostlyto labour with greater [earnistings]for the duration of the sould of afirmntto their deliverance from the reign-ing power of sin & Satan, than has your Mother in your Fathers behalf &I had thought, those seasons of opporti-tion on account of the same of which thereshared in neat abundance [illegible]depenating since in again digeepassed a way but I perceive aseerived of the same in a specialmanner since I joined this Campwhich has tended to weigh downmy spirits & to cast a gloom overmy journey to California, butwhatever you may fel to impartthis change in the mind of your Fatherunto any one else, I can say in truththat I know when it commandsby what instrument [illegible] he limplion 
 was presented to his mind, it wasat the time we were looking for yourarrival at Farmington & began to fearyou were Shipwricked, & we both feltvery anxious, but as you did not comeyour father said to me one day onwhat do you think we shall do if heshould not come, (suming to feel a verydifferent frame of mind than he had before)Why, said I, have no doubt but thierwould be some way provided for us butI should feel it to be a great calamitywhatever might become of us, but Ipercieved at once that your father hador was giving away to quite a newspirit from what he had for a longtime previous, as he began to explictupon me for those things & others, forwhich I was no more to blame thanI was because you didnot come atthe time appointed & this spirit hascontinued to a greater or less degree tillthe present time. & when we came to Nauvoo 
 there seemed to be a plenty to feed & promote this undue & unjust spirit,every word spoken by myself ever so honestly was invested into a bughear & become a crime worthy of deep censure, & sinceI joined the Camp, your father has treated me with the greatest neglect, indifference, & hostility, so much as that he has hardly given me a pleasant word & besides in one or two instances he has treated me before company in the most unfeeling & unreasonable manner as in the case of three evenings past, the one in which I dissolved a part of a pill for susane& wailed on Marys limb which she hadhurt & administered some what to Lars he being sick, & what was the great cause, of those dreadful answers I had why, after I had got through the doing of good, I seated myself in the Rocking chair to rest a moment expe-cting to undress me very shortly but But had wanted a discloth & I took in my 
 Saunders Oliver  2Saunders Harry   2hand a piece of old bed tick to cut off one or two, while I rested me a little, your father had got to bed & as is very natural to him began to speak of my going to bed I told him I was coming directly but wanted to sit one moment, &c , but this did not satisfy but began to frown in a most unfriendly manner & to accuse me of such things as a great deal of women far worse than myself never ought to be guilty of & that in the presence of Miss King, Mary & Sarah untill I was ashamed, yet I could not think neither can I now, that I had done anything out of order, or negleglected to do any thing which I ought to have done & I felt & do still, that the trials I have been called to pass through of leaving Eunice & family with her poor state of health & extreme poverty, is absuredtly sufficient for me to grapple with 
 92without the addition of a repecticianof those trials which I have fomerlyexperiences in consequence of anearnest desire for the salvation of thesoul of my companion, & I deffeelan assurance that your father cannotenjoy any good degree of prosperty eitherin body or spirit untill he seeks repentanceat the hand of god, & I ahve no moredoubt of his being convinced eerlings of the unrighteous coursehe has persued than I have of anything which I am assured will comeIndeed he cannot stand it muchhe already fals with the ApostlePaul that it is hard to kick agaisntthe pricks I do not wish, nor haveI time to particularize but, whenyour father left son Websters houseat bedrim just before he was aabout to take his final leave of hisonly Daughter when he designed

 574 pounds 16 shillings and one penny.After regulating the accounts and writingMy Valedictory For the Starall in the midst of a whirl of business I bade farewell to EldersHedlock Ward and Wilson and others around ^and^ with Elder JosephA. Stratton I went on board the packet ship Ashburtonof the Swallow-tail line bound for New York with itspassengers and crew.We hoisted anchor and was towed outinto the channel by a steam tug on the morning of the 23 of January. The tug left us about 15 miles outand we set sail and went on our course.My wife and children with a companyof the Saints were crossing the Atlantic for New Orleans onthe ship Liverpool and I now commencing my voyageaccross to New York. It was designed that my wifewith the two children with her should go direct towards Nauvooand I by the way of New York to fetch my daughter Phebefrom my wife's sister ^Sarah Foss^ in Sc^arborough^ and alsoto take with me to Nauvoo my Father and Stepmother.Man OverboardAbout a week after we set sail during a roughish day ^storm^ the second mate steped forward to the bowof the ship and ordered one of the hands to do something onthe bowsprit who refused upon the plea that it wasdangerous and at the risk of his life. The mate repliedthat he would not ask a man to do a thing he was notwilling to do himself and forthwith attempted the taskAt the same moment we shipped a sea which instantly 
 washed him overboard. The cry of second mate overboard immediatelyrang through the ship and ropes were thrown out to him but hecould not get them. The buoy was next flung to him and he swamhard to reach it but could not as the sea was running so high itfloated to the leeward of him. The captain then gave orders to ^bout^the ship which was going 8 knotts an hour. This was done as spedilyas possible still it took several minutes to accomplish. TheLife boat was then ^let^ down at the same time and Harry the boatswainand four other hands maned it. Notwithstanding the high seasthey managed the boat well. The second mate continued to swimfor 15 or twenty minutes in the raging billows even until theLife boat was within a few rods of him when he instantly sunkto rise no more. They remained on or near the spot wherehe was last seen—both the ship and the boat—but nothing more wasseen of him. The boat then came along-side but it was with great difficulty they put on board the ship and they came near beingswamped several timesAfter every exertion had been made they wereoblidg[ed] to trim the sails to the wind and continue their courseleaving the unfortunate mate in his watery grave. The Captainand crew seemed much affected by the event.The name of the second mate was William Drummond an American native of floshing ^Flushing^ Long Island New YorkHe was a single man had been in the East Indian trade with ourCaptain William Holland. This was his first trip in the Liverpooltrade and he was now on his return home. He was a stirringambitious young man and it was remarkable with what pleasurethe night before he spoke of taking tea with his mother on his arrvalhome. But in the midst of his young ambitious hopefullife he was suddenly in death burried in his watery graveHarry the boatsman took the place of the unfortunate secondmate and soon the ship's companywas sailing on as though nothing had happened. 
 A Strange StoryWhile on our voyage Elder Stratten related to methe following narativeI ^"^iIn company with some friends on the 22nd ofOctober 1845 I went to visit a young maiden who was in a ^kind^ ^of^ trance. She was the daughter of James and Susan Corner ^Comer^and her own name was Ann Corner ^Commer^. Her parents lived atthe village of Farrington Gurney Sommersertshire England; and the village is 12 miles from Bath and 15 from Bristol.Ann was a sprightly child until the age of 12 years atwhich time she was take[n] with convulsions and fits for five weeksHer jaws became locked and eyes closed; she lost the use of herlimbs and was only able to turn her head and raise her hand a fewinches. The last article of food she was ever known to eat wasa small portion of an egg. This was upwards of eight yearsago during which time there has nothing entered her mouthor passed from her. She breaths through her nose withregular breathing and her pulse also beats regularly thoughquite feble. She has grown about 2 inches in height duringthis state looks very pleasant and has a smile upon hercountenance. It is the oppnion [opinion] of some that she is notinsensible and as incredible as the case may seem I couldnot find a doubt among any one in the neighbourhood of thecorrectness of the statement given me. I pressed her handseveral times and received a light pressure in return. Herfingure nails have come off three times during the eightyears but at the present time they are perfect. Manyof the first Physicians in Bath have visited her andsome have spent three or four days at a time with herThey have desired to have her removed to the Hospitalbut her parents will not alow it and as much as possible 
 the family have tried to prevent the rumour of the case of theirdaughter from going abroad.We Arrive at New YorkMarch the 6thAfter a very long ^stormy^ and fatiguing passage of ^43^days we landed on my native shore thankful enough oncemore to put our feetAs soon as we landed brother Stratton MrHastings and myself went to an eating house and got a bo ^dish^of oysters which we relished very much after so long a trip and the exhausted ship's fare; but we were more reconcilled to ourhard passage when we found that other ships had passedquite as long and hard a voyage as ourselves that trys some ofthem coming in dismasted and all had suffered muchElder Stratton started for Nauvoo and I to Farmington my native place to take my father andstep-mother with me to Nauvoo and thence to find a newhome with the Saints in their exodus to the Rocky MountainsI reached Farmington on the 11th found all matters concerningmy father and mother as I ^according^ to my expectations butmy Aunt Anna Cossett had died which broke up the ^her^family. Her daughter Ann was going into a factory Cyrusto Canton in the blacksmith business which left mycousin Betsey alone and she desired to go with myfathers family and the SaintsLeaving Farmington for a season Istarted for my wife's father's to fetch my daughter Phebewhom I found a large fleshy girl.I reached Saco on the 17th and calledupon my wifes sister whom I found in good health faithand spirits and with her Phebe her daughter and my childPhebe whom I soon caught in my arms and kissed 
 I took dinner with my sister-in-law ^Sarah^Foss and then went with her to Father Carter's in a wagon.I found my wife's father well and the rest of the family exceptingMary whom I thought had somewhat failed since I last sawher. With my father-in-law and others of the family I spent thenight at his house. He told me that the spirit of motherdid often at night visit him. ^visited him almost evey night.^My wife had given me as her last requestthat her father should be baptized and receive the Priesthood atmy hands before I left him and thus I communicated tohim. He said that he had desired at times to be baptized and thought he would at this time if I stayed over anotherday but next morning he was reluctant as the waterwas frozen &c so I thought it best to start on my journeythat day as I was so late in the season and our people hadto leave Nauvoo that SpringFather Carter was 73 years of age thatvery day. Before I bade him farewell we visited togethermother's grave walking on the crust of snow that coveredthe ground but her grave was bare. The old manpointed to a spot beside it and said "that place willsoon be my bed." I took some pebbles from the graveto carry to Phebe.At our parting our aged fatherwas much affected and wept. He sent his best parentallove to his daughter and wished me to say to her that he was a firm beleivedr in the Book of Mormon and thefaith of the Latter-day Saints and that as soon as he sawhis way clear he would endeavour to be baptizedI arrived at Farmington onthe 9th and we commenced directly our packingand arrangements for our journey 
 Farewell To My Native PlaceWe arose early on the morning of the 23 of Marchto start on our journey to Nauvoo. We took breakfast and badefarewell to the town of Farmington and the inhabitants thereofOur company consisted of my father mother and cousin BetseyCossett with myself and little daughter PhebeIt was a pleasant morning. We rode to New Britain in a waggon and when we were on the topof the mountain I cast my eyes back upon my native placeI gave to it a final and probably my last adieuWe did not get to the station in seasonfor the passenger train so we took the baggage train to New Haven. Here I found Elder ^Bro^ Adams from Springfieldand he went with me to the United States Riffle Factoryand I bought four riffles with extra barrelsAfter the various incidents usualon such a journey we arrived in Nauvoo on the 13th ofApril. We stoped at Keokuk for an hour and atabout 2 o'clock we started to assend the Rapids. Inabout 2 hours we came in sight of the Temple andthe city of Nauvoo. I immediately got my spy glassand tookA View in the Distance of the Cityand Temple which to my eyes looked truly splendidThe boat stoped at Montrose andthen crossed to Nauvoo at the upper landing. I soongot a waggon and took my friends to my house where I hadthe happy privilege of again meeting my dear wife andchildren who arrived only a few days before me having alsolike myself had a long voyage accross the ocean being 9 weeksand fourteen days on the passage 
 [top of page blank]When I arrived at Nauvoo I found the Saints[bottom of page blank] 
 Dedication of The Templeof the Lord in NauvooApril the 30th 1846In the evening of this day I repared to the Temple andwith Elder Orson Hyde and about 20 others of the Elders of Isreal alldressed in our Priestly robes we dedicated the Temple of the Lord builtunto His most Holy Name by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Notwithstanding the prophesies of SydneyRigdon and others that the roof should not go on and the Houseof the Lord be finished and the threats of the mob that we shouldnot dedicate it we had finished the work of the Temple of God and now dedicated it to his most holy name ^him^. After thededication we raised our voices in the united shout of Hosanna toGod and the Lamb.After our dedication and the offering up of our prayers for the Camp of Israel and that we might not be disturbed byany mob during our further services of dedication we returned to ourhomes thankful for the privilege which we had enjoyed in our eveningsservice.Public Dedicationof the Temple of the LordMay the 1st 1846Next On this day we met for a public dedicationof the Temple and on entering each paid one dollar to clear the debt upon it and pay the hands who had built it. I paid seven 
 dollars for my company who were seven in number consisting of myself wife fathermother cousin ^and others^I opened the meeting by prayer and was followed with remarksfrom Elder Orson Hyde who also offered up the dedication prayer. AfterwardsElder Almon Babbit was called upon to address the meeting which he did muchto the edification of the assembly.On Sunday the 3rd the dedication was continued.The Saints began to assemble at an early hour and at ten o'clock the housewas well filled. Orson Hyde myself and Elder Stratton occupied the upperstand.After ^the^ singing Elder Stratton opened the service by prayerand then Elder Orson Hyde arose and addressed the congregation fromthe passage of Scripture:"What is man that thou art mindful of himor the Son of man that thou visiteth^est^ him"After Elder Hyde had closed I addressed the assembly and the meeting desmissed and the dedication of the Templeended.On the 7th I had an interview with John Taylorwho had returned to the City to settle his business and next day wentover the river to the camp and on the following one our company fromthe east arrived with our baggageOn the Sunday I received several lettersone of which was from President Brigham Young from the Campof Israel and another from Elder Elijahsha H Davis from LondonI went to the Temple at an early hourand found the house filled. Elder Phelps opened by prayer and I addressed the congregation ^from the words of Solm. There is a time for all things &c^ and was followed by Elders ^Amos^ FieldingBenjamin Clap and others. This wasThe Last Time I Preachedin theTemple of the Lord at Nauvoo. 
 Next day I crossed the river to Montroseand bought 2 yoke of oxen and Paid 50 dollars per yoke and thendrove them up to the camp where my waggons were and during severalfollowing days I was busy at home preparing for my journeyI left Nauvoo on the 16th and crossed theMissisippi with my wagons and family and camped about one mile fromMontrose where also Orson Hyde was camped. I was very weary withthe continued and unceasing exertions which I had for months been making bothbefore and after my return to Nauvoo to follow with my family the body of the Church to find a new home.The next day was one of the most perplexingof my life. I had on the ground three baggage waggons one familycarriage six yoke of oxen six cows 4 calves one yearling and a pairof mules making in all 25 head. I started to go to the Black JackGrove to Camp. The whole care was upon myself. As soon as we hadstarted the cows and calves all ran various ways and while I was tryingto get them together the oxen broke the tongue out of my carriage  Afterthat was mended by leaving part of our stock we got started but we hadnot gone far before my father drove into a mud hole and the oxenmired down. We put on 8 yoke of oxen to draw the waggonout but we could not and broke four chains in the attempt. Wehad to dig the waggon out at last and finally got camped at BlackJack Grove very weary though we had made ^but^ four miles.I returned to Nauvoo on the morrowand sold our prairie land for goods and next day crossed the river to Montroseand had an interview  with a company of Saints from Pennsylvaniaand among them was Brother Sidwell who gave to Brother Orson Hydeseven hundred dollars for the Camp $100 for himself and $100 for meI again returned to Nauvoo and arrangedsome business. Here I saw Mother Woodruff my sister Eunice and her husband and Mother Smith together and some unpleasant feelingswere manifested upon the subject of Strang and his followers. Iparted with Eunice and her husband for the last time and again 
 crossed the river and road^rode^ to the Camp a distance of 20 milesI rode to Montrose next day and got my goods. I hadto pay 100 dollars on my patent flouring mill and 70 for freightage. I returnedto the Camp where I spent the next day.Adieu to NauvooI was in Nauvoo on the 22nd for the last time andleft this city of the Saints feeling that most likely I was taking a final farewellof it in this life. I looked upon the Temple and city as it recededfrom me and I asked the Lord to ^remember^  preserve it as a monument of thesacrifices of His Saints.I returned to Camp Painted my ^waggon covers^ and prepared formy journey during the several following days and struck our tents onthe 25th and drove to Charlestown where we camped for the night. HereI remained in Camp during the next day. as I had taken cold andfelt quite lame and had a few days before sprained my sholder and thumbamong the cattle. Brother H. Clark J Townsend and many others passedus during the day and brother Smoot came up and camped with us forthe night.My Father Nearly KilledJust before we stoped to camp on the 27 a serious accidenthappened to my father. He went to get into the waggon whilethe oxen were travelling and the foreboard which he had taken holdof gave way. He fell instantly upon his back and  both wheels of the waggon loaded with 25 cwt passed over his legs and arms and camenear passing over his head. I expected at first that it had killedhim but we soon found that it had not nor broken any bones thoughit had badly brused his flesh.We journeyed to Farmington next day. Here the whole of the company bought their flour—I bought 4 barrels—and then we 
 crossed the Desmoin River at the Farmington Ferry and went four miles andcamped. We were now twenty five miles from NauvooWe lay still through the next day and I reloadedmy teams ^waggon^ and sent back to Farmington for sundry articles. Father wasquite lame but doing well considering how badly he was injuredSeveral days after we overtook the Ramus Company of about 25 waggons and on the next I went to Bloomfield and bought two more yoke of cattle for which I paid $20 for one yoke and $30for the other.Sunday the 7th we killed our last calf andin the afternoon travelled till sundown when we came to a longswail one mile and half across. This was the worse piece of roadwe had passed. My carriage and family went through it andI got my waggons half through by dark when the wheels of mywaggon cut to the hub in turf and mud and with 8 yoke of cattle I could not get through and two of my waggons remainedin the swamp all night. My cousin Betsey was in one ofthen and remained all night. I was in the mud and waterup to my knees till 2 o'clock and among the cattle nearly all night. At daylight I rolled myself up in a Buffaloo robe and got some sleep and we rested through the day both man and beast.We travelled 20 miles next day and campednear the Macedonia Company consisting of 31 waggons and travelledwith them through the following day an^d^ at night I called thecamp together and addressed them.Next morning I started the company accordingto our organization. We passed through a bad swail and my men brokeanother tongue out of my waggon. We went to timber cut a stick and put in a new one and camped for the dayWe journeyed on for the next few dayspassing camps of the Saints and holding occassional connection with otherfamilies on the road and on the 15th of June we arrived at the 
 Camp of Israel called Mount Pisgah. I had an interview with brothers Charles C. Richand Huntington the President and Council at Mount Pisgah and many otherfriends. I encamped on the east side of the creek and the Camp ofIsrael. Here I learned that Brother Noah Rogers who had just returned froma mission to the South Sea Islands was dead and the first person burriedin the burrying ground at Mount Pisgah. Bro Turnbow one of our companyalso lost a child to day. I attended to its burrial on the morrow andvisited the encampment.The day after I rode through the encampmentto buy a ton of flour to fit out my company. I rode thirty miles and was sick at night and continued unwell next day but rode a good part of thetime. I went to see Lorenzo Snow who had been quite sick. I administeredto him and he was relievedThe following day I got home my flour. I boughtfor myself 16 80 lbs at 3 cts per lb and also some for brother Blanchard andSanders and the next day I had a thorough overhauling of my loads andrepacking. I left a number of chests barrels &cOn the Sunday the 21st I preached to a largecongregation of the Saints on Mount Pisgah and enjoyed the spirit ofGod and was followed by Elders Huntington Rich Benson and SherwoodWe had a good meteting. Some assistance was called for to help meoff. Some money was donated and oxen and waggons promisedAfter meeting an express came from thePresident at Council Bluffs requiring 100 mounted men as dragoonsfor a guard and Buffalou Hunters for the Camp of Israel.Next evening I met the people to raisethe 100 volunteers of mounted men and addressed the assembly on theimportance of complying with the request made and assisting the Twelveand those associated with them to go to the Mountains and liftup the Standard of Zion. I then called for the volunteers andabout 60 followed me out in the line. We appointed the next evening to meet again at which time we met and afterwards wroteto the President reporting what we had done in the matter. 
 The Call For Five Hundred Volunteersby President PolkOn the 26th our Camp was thrown into some excitementby the appearence of JCapt. J. Allen with 3 drggoons of the US. armyI soon met Bro Huntington and his council with Capt Allen to enquireinto his business and he informed us that he was sent by order of Capt Col Kerney who had been instructed by President Polk to givethe Mormons an invitation to raise five hundred volunteersto assist the United States in the Mexican War. We treatedthe agent courteously and directed him on to Council Bluffs to laythe matter before the President Young.Next day I received a letter fromPresident Young and wrote him one and sent him a messenger beforethe troops.I was unwell on the Sunday yet I preachedto the Saints at Mount Pisgah and had an interview with ElderClayton and next day I gathered my company with their cattleand waggons together and bid adieu to the friends at Mount Pisgah and travelled on.When I started from Mount Pisgah I hadsix waggons one carriage sixteen yoke of oxen 7 cows 2 mules and one horse in all 42 headAfter we had completed building a new bridgeover the creek by ^when^ we camped at the end of our first days journeyfrom Mount Pisgah we gathered up our cattle and started on our wayI stoped my carriage on the top of arolling prarrie where I had a fine view. I could stand and gazeto the east west north and south and behold the Saints pouring out andgathering like clouds from the hills and dales groves and prairieswith their teams waggons flocks and herds by hundreds and thousandsIt looked like the Moving of a Nation 
 Call For the PioneersAfter travelling a few miles on the 1st of July we werevisited by Elder Parley P. Pratt who was direct from Council Bluffs and wasa Messenger to all the Camp of Isreal. I formed a circle of about 50 waggonsand he delivered his errand. He was sent to raise a company ofmen as pioneers to go immediately to the mountains without their familiesto pick out a location and put in Spring and fall crops. The quorum ofthe Twelve had volunteered to goAfter we got our message I drove ahead as fast aspossible with my teams. We travelled 20 miles with our ox waggonsand camped at about 10 o'clock at night man and beast wearied out.Next day we journeyed till 7 o'clock at nightand on the following one was overtaken by Brother Parley returning in company with Brother Benson who had been nominated to fill the placeand wear the crown of John E. Page.Brothers Pratt and Benson wished me to returnaccompany them to the Bluffs so I saddled my horse and started withthem.Village of the Pottawattime Indians.It was interesting to be once more with brother Parleyand to add to the interest of our day's ride we passed through themain village of the Pottawatamie Indians. This was the firsttime in my life I had ever passed through a large villiage ofIndians.After viewing the Indians and their villageawhile we continued our journey and rode until dark thenunsaddled our horses and made our bed in the grass onthe side of the hill but the musketoes soon routed us outWe had to go to the top of the hill where we again laiddown and spent the night in the wind and in the morningI felt quite stiff and sore. 
 Next day was the 4th of July—Independence dayWe arose saddled our beasts and rode about 10 miles and took breakfastwith some brethren and as we had no supper the night before our appetiteswere good. Here we were informed that President Brigham YoungHeber C. Kimball and Willard Richards were but a short distancefrom us encamped and were on their way to Mount Pisgah. Weimmediately rode down to them and it was truly a happy meetingand I rejoiced once more to st[r]ike hands with these noble men forit was the first time we had met since I left Nauvoo on mymission to England in 1844 soon after the martyrdom of Joseph andHyrumBrother Brigham and his companions Heberand Willard insisted that I should return with them so brother Bensonmyself and several of the Life guard returned until I met my familyand company and I had the privilege of introducing to the brethrenmy father and others. After spending a little time together theycontinued their journey to Mount Pisgah to raise the five hundredvolunteers for the service of the United States. I tarried withmy family. I had ridden about 50 miles already that day andwas exceedingly sore and stiff and almost sick.The Sunday followed and we continued to journey slowly through the day and on the next evening wecamped at the same place where I had camped with Parley inthe grass. An Indian Chief camped near us with somesquaws. The Indian said he was going to meet with Mormonsand smoke the pipe of peace.Early next morning some 50 Indianssaid to belong to the Sioux passed our camp for the east.They said they were going to meet the Mormon Chief. We supposed they ment President Young who had gone to MountPisgah. They were noble looking IndiansWe laid by this day to let our cattlerest. I was called upon to administer the ordinance of the Church 
 to sister Grant and she had a daughter born in five minutes after I left. Thuschildren were born unto Israel in the wilderness and by the way side as in thedays of oldNext morning we continued our journey and came along side of the General encampment at Council Bluffs at about noon.I saw the encampment of some of the Twelve and had an interview withElders Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor and many other friends.I pitched my tent and camp on a bluff near Elders Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor. It rained hard at night.In the evening we held a council about raisingthe 500 volunteers for the President of the United States to go to UpperCalifornia and for the Mexican warVisit From Col. KaneI spent the 11th in Camp assisting to gatherthe Volunteers. We had a visit from Col. Kane from the city ofWashington confirming the declaration that President Polk had sent for five hundred Mormon Volunteers. He informed us that thePresident was very favourable to our people and that he had taken thiscourse for our good. Col. Kane manifested the spirit of a gentlemanand much interest in our welfare.From the information received from Col. Kane ^him represented^ we were convinced that God had begun to move upon theheart of the President and others of the nation to act for our interest andthe general good of Zion. The object of Presedent Polk was to enlist500 of the Latter-day Saints and feed cloth[e] and pay them andlet them go direct to California via Santa Fe and take possessionof that country and prepare a way for the body of the Churchto come which would make them the first settlers of thatcountry.Elder Taylors company was encamped on thesouth of the chime ridge or Redemption Hill and mine on the north 
 about 5 rods apart. Elder Parley P. Pratt was ten rods north of my companyWe built a bowery between Elder Taylor's ten and my own and a largeassembly of the Saints met at an early hour the first Sunday afterI arrived at Council Bluffs. I was called upon to address themand give an account of my travels through England Scotland Waleswhich I did for about the space of an hour. Parley P.

Pratt and John Taylor go to England forthwith andremove Reuben Hedlock from office and also Thomas Wardand call them to America and regulate all the business of the British MissionThe enrolment of the companies forthe service of The United States in the Californian expeditionhad been prompt and strongly characteristic of the loyalspirit of our people. Notwithstanding the ill treatment 
 and sufferings we had endured in the persecutions yet while in the midst of a long journey we steped forward as a people at once at the call of our countryThe President of the United States asked us for 500 volunteers for the serviceof the Mexican war and instantly the men steped forth at the callThe Mormon BattaliaonThe 16th was a great day in the Camp of Israel and importantto the whole Church. Four companies of the volunteers were organized and ready for marching. They were brought together and formed into a hollow square by their Captains and then addressed by several of thequorum of the Twelve in a very suitable mannerThe MarchAt the close of the address the Battalion commencedits march in double file from Redemption Hill for seven milesacross the Missouri River Bottom to the Ferry. The brethrenwho formed these companies had left their families teams and waggonsand cattle standing by the way side not expecting to meet them againfor one or two years. Yes here by the way side they left theirwives and children to the mercy of God and their brethren but theywent away with cheerful hearts beleving they were thus doing the willof God. As I viewed them I considered that I was lookingupon the first Battalion of the army of Israel engaged in the serviceof the United States.Ordination of Ezra T. Benson to the Twelve^(July 16)^After the march of the Battalion the quorum of theTwelve met in Council and ordained Ezra T Benson to fill the placeof John E.

Herewe camped for the night with some of the Saints who had arrivedtwo hours before us. This was the first Mormon camp on theBig PigeonNext morning I arose took breakfast and thenwent to examine the Big Pigeon which I found well supplied with goodfish. I returned to the waggons and then with the Twelve to RedemptionHill but a company of six men crossed the Big Pigeon to explorethe country.With Mrs Woodruff I rode to the encampmentnear the Ferry to see the Mormon Battalion of 500 men who weremaking preparations to start on their journey to California PresidentYoung called the officers of the company together and gave themgood counsel concerning their march to their destination.

We put on our robes and offered up our prayersto God conversed upon principle and decided that no man has a right toattend to the ordinance of sealing except the President of the Church or those who are directed by him so to do and that the ordinance should be confinedto Zion or her stakes. This was the last council we were expectedto hold together before the departure of Elders O Hyde P. P. Pratt andJohn Taylor for EnglandWe had an interesting time in our counciland at the close Brother Parley, George A. and John Taylor started forour camp at the Bluffs. We rode part of the way to the river in acarriage and then I walked with Brother Parley and took skiff and rowedover the river and then started for home but in taking a near road acrossa slough in the dark we missed our way and wandered some time in thedense weeds willows bushes &c. We at last found our road and arrivedat brother Pratts tent in the bottom where I parted from him and lostmy way ^again^ going to the Bluff but arrived at last at my tent at 10 o'clockvery weary having walked about 12 miles after sundownNext day I got together my teams early inthe morning and started for the ferry to cross but found Brother 
 Pratt before me with twelve wagons and as it took the whole day to get theseover I had to remain with mine on the bank until the morrow whenwe commenced about sunrise to take our cows over with a skiff bytying their heads to the boat and rowing them over. We took over twenty thus and also some oxen and as we had not enough men I tookone of the oars myself and assisted in ferrying in the hot sun andthen drove teams up the hills through the mud and when I gotthrough my days work I felt hardly able to stand up and nex[t]day we were all unwell in consequence of fatigueI continued unwell also on the followingday but attended a council of the Twelve and dined with DrWillard RichurdsSuddenly a thunderstorm struck us.The water beat through our waggon covers and the wind drove ourfamily carriage down a steep hill turned it bottom side upwardand smashed the top to pieces but providentially there wasno one in it and everything was saved ^that was in the carriage medicine bottles and all^ but the bottles in the carriage Very heavy thunderstorms continued during the night and the bedsbedding and family was drenched and several tents in the camptorn downWinter Quarters DecidedAugust the 2ndThe council of the Twelve met on this Sunday afternoonand decided that Winter Quarters of the Camp of Israel shouldbe located near where we then wereA messenger had just arrived from theMormon Battalion within 30 miles of Fort Leavenworth.

Fromthence we rode to the Camp of Israel and saw on our way theOmaha Village or lodges which was quite a picteresque viewWe carried home to our families some vegatables.On our return to the Camp we found thepeople much improved in health but we also found an evil in the Camp. A man by the name of Barnum not a member of the Church had joined with other young men in spending their timeat nights in fiddling and dancing and afterwards leading away youngwoman into folly and wickednessIn Council with Two Tribes of IndiansAugust the 27thI met with the Twelve and High Council with twotribes of Indians. The object was to get permission to stayon the land that season and to use wood grass and water fortwo or three years or as long as we wished while gathering to themountains.We first met with the Otoes between whomand the Omahas there was a dispute as to who owned the landThe Otoes said the land was theirs. The chief with fiveor six others were present. We talked to him and he went home. 
 We afterwards all met in Council with the Omahas. The oldchief's name was Big Elk and his son a young chief called Young Elk. Therewere also present about 60 old men and braves of the tribe. As it was latethe Council was adjourned until the morrow. We then met incouncil among ourselves and did some business and among other thingsappointed 3 men to buy up the cattle and sell beef.

We smoked the pipe of peace and thenPresident Young spoke to them through their interpreter. He toldthem it was our desire to winter there and that if they wished wewould do some work for them—make them a field fix theirguns &c and said many other things which I did not report.The Big Elk replied:"My Son, Thou hast spoken well. I haveall thou hast said in my heart. I have much I want to sayWe are poor. When we go to hunt game in one place we meet anenemy, and so in another place. Our enemies kill us. We do notkill them. I hope we will be friends. You may stay on theselands two years or more. Our young men may watch yourcattle. We would be glad to have you trade with us. We willwarn you from^of^ danger from other Indians."Much more was said by Big Elk.

KimballWillard Richards W Woodruff George A Smith and A Lymanof the Twelve with others started in search of Council Bluffswe had a pleasant day's ride and we all enjoyed ourselves well 
 excepting that I suffered from caker in the mouth. We rode over hill and daleabout 25 miles and camped 12 miles above the BluffsThe Old Council BluffsSeptember the 1st. We arose washed prayed breakfastedand started down the river to find the Bluffs. We came to a creek andhad to build a bridge before we could cross. The Indian trail went upthe Bluff which was the road to be taken but as we didhad no guidewe kept the table land under the bluff.We passed through a flat about two milesacross covered with pea vines grass weeds and cane from five to tenfeet high. We had to wallow through without ^our^ horses anwaggons. Four of us finally climbed the bluff and traced the trailback to the bridge we made and then returned to the horsemen andwaggons. There were 10 of the former and three of the latter.We came to another creek which we had tobridge and after crossing it on to another flat of about 600 acresand here we found Council Bluffs at ^near^ sundownThere was nothing standing of the old Barracksexcept the body of the Magazine with one gable end made ofbrick arched over. We walked to the edge of the bluff. Beforeus on the bottom appeared a small grove of willows beyond it a smallstream of muddy water and in the distance a dense mass of Cottonwoodand Willow. I started up a deer a few rods of me and we tried to get a shot at him but could not. A wolf also wentinto the forest before us.W After looking about the premises of theold Council Bluffs about an hour and seeing nothing invitingwe started on our return and after travelling about a milewe found a good spring and camped for the night. Nearthis place we started up a deer and the horsemen gave chasebut lost him. There were signs of deer and elk very 
 plentiful. Both man and beast of the company were very weary having ^going^through such heavy bottomsNext day we arose prayed and started for the Campof Israel which we reached in about 10 miles from the BluffsOn the following evening I was in Council with the Twelve and High Council and Orson Pratt wass called upon to report thevisit to the Otoes and Omahas. He reported that the Otoes would notgive a decesion until they came to the Camp and gave a dance. TheOmahas wanted also to come and give a war dance on their way to warwith the Sioux. The report was accepted and Brigham Young madea report of our journey North.Brothers O Pratt H C. Kimball P. RockwellJ. M Grant, Eldridge myself and others on the 5th went in searchof a new ferry.

Kane Receives His Patriarchal BlessingSept. the 7thCol. Kane called upon me at my tent for the lasttime to day as he was about to leave for the east. He had beensick for several weeks but was now getting well. Before he lefthe desired to receive his Patriarchal Blessing under the handsof Father John Smith. I went with him to the tent of the 
 Patriarch who laid his hands upon Col. Kane and blessed himI wrote the blessing and presented the Col. with a copy of itin my own handwritingNext morning I took the parting hand of ColKane who left the Camp for the east also Bishop Whitney with several of the brethren started for St Louis to buy goods for theCamp of IsraelOn Sunday the 13th we held meeting. OrsonPratt discoursed upon Sceentific principles. He was followed byPresident H. C. Kimball and then the Marshall of the city ^said^that the City Council had passed certain acts among which werethat "there shall be no firing^shooting^ of firearms after sundownand no timber cut within 20 miles of the place without thedirection of the council and that dogs be taken care of andno more shot without the direction of the MarshallDiscourse of President YoungAfterwards President Young arose and said:"I wish to say a few words upon principleI desire the brethren and sisters to be taught in all things necessaryThere is one thing I want you to realize and that is that Godangels and Saints—heaven and all of Gods creations are governedby law. And I want the Camp of Israel to understandthat we must be. If Heaven was not controlled by lawwhat sort of a place would it be? I would not wish to be therefor where we rushed into heaven without law every man wouldbe in danger of loosing his rights and having them trampledupon. But all celestial beings are governed by law andorder for the celestial law is a perfect order of things—aperfect system of light law intelligence exaltation and glorywhere every person's right's are sustained to the fullest extent 
 But we do not arrive at this at once. As an Apostle said we have preceptupon precept line upon line here a little and there a little until wearrive at a fulness of knowledge and glory even that fulness whichreigns in the heavensWe must begin to be governed by law herebefore we are prepared to receive the fulness that reigns in Heaven.The whole law has not been given and you cannot abide the whole asyet. If it had all been given we should all have been smashedup and destroyed. A people must become acquainted thoroughly with law before they can abide it; but the time has come whenwe must have law and order in our midstThere has been some feelings of late in theCamp because some unruly boys have been floged by the Marshallfor their wickedness; but if this Camp is not willing to let lawand order reign here and put a stop to such wickedness I wishyou to let me know it and I will go away from you for thosewho wish to sustain crime and corruption let them return andstrike hands with the mob and carry out their principles and bedamned. But if you want to do right say so. This peoplehave been driven here for their desires to do righteousness andthis wickedness shall be put a stop to that has been manifest inthe camp by certain young people of late. Yes it will bestopped if God comes out and smites it by judgement. TheMarshall did not whip them hard enough or they would nothave spit out their revenge but it would have been whippedout of them. If I am drove to the necessity of whippinga person in such a case they will not spit out revenge afterwardsfor I will whip it out of them.Shall we any longer sustain in our midstmen who will carry out the principles of John C. Bennett andother corrupt scoundrils? No: I will sware by the EternalGod of Heaven that such conduct shall be stopped and shallnot be permitted in this Camp for if they continue it I will 
 tell the Marshall what the law is and they shall be taken care offin a manner that they will not whine and I will whip any manwho will sustain it. And I prophesy in the name of Godthat such a man whether old or young shall be bowed down withsorrow and mourning even more than this people have. Thenstop before you further go and not sport upon the brink ofsorrow and mourning. This people have the law of libertyand the Gospel and the more the light and liberty and greaterthe privileges the stricter the law. We are going into thewilderness and shall we suffer such things? No: I sware bythe Eternal God such things shall not be while Brighamlives.Brother Kimball gave a good shotwhen he said that no man would run into his waggon andsware that he would shoot the Marshall if he came after himexcept he was guilty of crime. No man is affraid excepthe is guilty. No man need be affraid who does rightI defy the world to say that I have taken away ^any^ man's right^s^ butafter we have been driven into the wilderness we are still followedby men who sware that they will steal what they get in ourmidst. I sware tThey shall not have it in our midstSome young Elders who never preacheda sermon in their lives are affaid that I shall have more blessings than they or more wives or something or other but letthem go and preach the world over as I have in poverty anddistress with blood in my shoes and spent years and yearsat it and left my wife and children who have also suffered much,let them do as we have done and they will not be jealous of meabout blessings. If the Lord should give me a thousandwoman is it any man's business. No. Let such go andspend as much time as I have and there will be many clinging on to their skirts to be savedThe majority of the men of the Gentile 
 world will be damned and the women wished to be saved by going with good menA woman that has the Spirit of God will go with a good man who has been faithfuland spent much time in saving mankind and who has the Priesthood. Such men ifthey continue faithful will be saved in eternal glory and those who are with themI am determined that my affections shall be withGod. I will not alow them to be placed on things that perish. When plaguesand disease get hold of our bodies we become loathsome and beautey fades awaybut our affections should be placed upon things that are noble exalted lastingand glorious. I love an exalted mind for it is eternal and cannotfade. I want all my affections to be subject to God and glory andeternal life. May God bless you: Amen.Removal Of the Camp of IsraelSeptember the 23rdOn this day we removed our encampment from theprairie ridge to the table land on the bank of the Missouri RiverThis was a beautiful place for a city and we laid our city out in blocksof 20 rods by 40 each lot 4 by 10. I had one block for mycompany which consisted of nearly 40 families so I had to put twofamilies on a ^lot^ block. It was a very busy day and as we had noyard we lost many of our cattle at night and I was hunting cattleall the next day while most of my division drew poles and made a fence to keep our cattle in.Arrival of Daniel H.
