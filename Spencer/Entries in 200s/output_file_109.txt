 [UPSIDE DOWN]  he lacks confidence and holds  his tongue.  This is one of the comforts in  partnerships.    I left Town in time to drive  to Doles where I put for the  night. On the way I stopped  to warm at Peeks and receieved  some very wholesome advice  to get be nighted somewhere  near Lyons for an excuse to  spend the night in company  with Miss Lyon his daughter  This was ingenious but as I could  not discover the propriety I rejected  the idea.  Early in the evening in attempting  to go to bed I got into the Kitchen  where were Mrs Noble Miss  Harriett Dole Mr Newman 
 [UPSIDE DOWN]  Jan 11th This morning find  Smith unsociable I left the Store  last night unlocked expecting his  return soon as he had gone  out while I was preparing to  go visiting. And did not mention  that he would be absent through  the evening. I left when I got  ready. He was in bed when  I returned and arose to let  me in chiding me for not telling  him that I was going away  Doubtless his mood to day originated  in this insident. he probably  either blames me for not telling  him that I was going out at the  same time that I had not been  in the store an hour during the  day or he thinks I blame  him for leaving without in time  acting is to me and hence 
 [UPSIDE DOWN]  Mr Mullen, an acquaintance was  kind enough to favor me with an  introduction to his sister to Miss  Lyon and to Miss McKinsley, by  which good fortune I was enabled   to pass the night pleasantly  I returned to Town in the morning  highly gratified with an entertainment  which had cost me so little emb-  -arrasment and left me this side  up.  The evening of Jan 10th I spent  at Mrs Coles. Misses Catharine   and Dorothea entertaining with  all possible good will. We told  each others fortunes. Played cards  talked sentiment, a little sense and  more nonsense concluded we liked  each other pretty well and  should be glad to see each other  now and then and quit. 
 [UPSIDE DOWN]  of hearts for sighs, or rather  more likely of sighs for hearts  And I am quite sure that one  sweet kiss from one of the fairest  of damsels went forth begging  sympathy where it should not,  I did not choose to dance  but one of my companions (it   was William) that to trip the  fantastic toe with a Young Belle  of a neighboring Town and  accordingly we find our Young  Hero at a suitable time bowing  most obsequiously before the fair  one and with breast swelling   high in Expectation we behold  him extending his arm with the  modest request that Miss would  dance with him. No-I thank  ye I jest has been dancing!! 
 [UPSIDE DOWN]  Friday ensuing the first of Jan. 7  I went up to Doles. in company  with Horace Blinn, William  Warren and Smith to attend  a Ball in honor of the Glorious  Eighth. The company was large  and quite miscellaneous The   object appeared to be. The great-  -est possible quantity of Amusement  estimated by the greatest gross  amount of dancing squeezed out  of the occasion, and it was  attained, for during the Twelve  hours I remained there. There   was no cessation of hop skip  and jump excepting the hour  allotted to supper.  No hearts I believe were lost though  there was a good deal of flow of  soul. There might indeed have  been some exchanged made- 
 [UPSIDE DOWN]  In the course of the ensuing week  I changed my place of boarding to  the Table of my friend Mr Irish  I was induced to do so partly on accord  of my conveniencce, but mainly because  I was pleased with the dociety of the  family. My Irish did not wish  boarders but took me out of regard  for my wishes And perhaps be-  cause he did not choose to deny my  request He said "there seems to   be a perfect understanding between  you and Mrs Irish" And I accepted   of his a place at his Table because  I had then pressed the matter  to far to recede. I have since  regretting this step for I fancy  that I am considered as acting  upon the principle that "It is  useless to have a friend unless we  use him." 
 [UPSIDE DOWN]  Jan 1 1837  New Year happened on Sunday  F. M. Irish came the the Store  and proposed going to Church with  me And to this singular circumstance  was added another, still more surprising,  in the fact that Mr Smith my  partner offered to join us! And we  all went to the Court House and  heard Elder Bennett from N.Y.  but Alas poor Smith! he was  so stricken in conscience for his  presumption that he found no peace  untill he made atonement at the  Dutchmans Coffe House.    I passed the evening at the house   of Mrs Coles mostly in the company   of Catharine & Dorothea.

 50  City of New Haven where we tarried  till we took a very plasent trade  soon after took the new steamer  Thavoiller for New York & set sail at  seven o clock the traverller was elegant  furnished & the Ladies Cabin well  filled with resputable looking Ladies  I did not retire early as I found the  most easy places for sitting,  We arrived in New York about one  of clock in the morning, at an early   hour we tooik coach for Mr Ilus Charter  who had previously invited Son W.  to take his Parents to his house  on his arrival in the City we met  with a hearty reception from her  she a Mis Charter spent their time  very agreeably untill Saturday  Morn when we left New York for  Philedelphia took steam boat &   rail road & arrived about 9 
 PM, & after riding about 9 miles    51  into the City took lodgings for the  Sabbath at a boarding house when  a number of the Saints also part up  on their way to Illinois, to day I  do not feel as comfortable in here  as when I left Farmington tho  the Journey has agreed with me  but the exercise of walking up  so many pairs of stair, as I have  had occasion to do to get to my  sleeping room does not so well  agree with me at New York at  Mr Carters I was conducted up thur  or four pair of stairs all nicely carpet  ed & slept on a bedstead ^of^ majogany  worth. I should think not car from a  hundred Dollars & coverlets of damask  silk & counter panes I spent the time very  agreeably with Mrs Carter & was favored  with an Interview with her sisters being four  in number but I have digussed, to day 
 being Monday March 30th we had  designed starting again on our Journey  for Nauvoo. But on account of  damage done by the [fleach eseh yot]  o[ver our judgment] till Sunday  this moner 31st we took baep for B  Baltemore the Morning pleasnt  I felt bad in health an hour or so,  but soon revised felt comfortable  arrived at Batimore about 2 O'ell  part up at a boarding house till'  next noon, took a supper ^ break-  fast, for which we paid twelve &   a half cents for meal. next morn  we started for Pittsburgh took cays,  st assed thro I did I are left the  cars about Sun Set took our Supper  at the stage Hotel, & made prepaeration  for Journeying through the night by  Coach to Pittsburgh a member of coach  esever made ready but I can supreance 
 53  of Mrs not being able to get where he  could pay his passage among the  fust, we took the last coach which  proved to be miserable filled out for   the object we wished to accomplish  by riding thro the night their horses  being worm out so that we did not  arrive at Pittsburgh like the next eve at  sunset, indeed it was not Pittsburgh  that we arrived at but Wilmington  from which place we took a steamer  & arrived some time in the night  next Morn we went into another  boat called the Clipper here we shipped  for Cincinnatti fore 5 Dollars, ech. -  board included got a good table quite a  large company on board of Ladies &  Gentlemen I have stood my journey   extremely well & on order of my low  state of health; I have enjoyed it much  have rested well at night untill the lest  in consiquence of being very busy yesterday   
 54  in arranging my Trunk around  or its contents I found myself quite  fatigued so that I did not rest at  night but awaked before morn  with a throbbing pain in my head  I have our felt better after ausing  from my bath & taking breakfast  we arivoed at Cincinnatti Sunday  Morn April 5th two days from Pitts-  burge being five hundred miles,  about five, & Sanu Morm, we left the  Clipper & took passage in the Lady-  Madison bound for St. Louis.  Monday morn April 6th  we are yet  laying at harbor but exspect to set  sail in the course of the afternoon  the chamber maid informs us that  Lady M, will probably make St. Louis  in three days.  This encourages us to  the belief that the last part of our journey  will be less fatigueing that the former 
 55  part & more expreditions as we shall  not have occasion to change[ ownyl]  of conveyance as much as in the former  As the time draws near of greeting  my dear friends by our arrival at the  place of their location an only daughter  with her little family husband & child.  The excellection of whom is associated  with many feelings of interest & affection  the question often arises in my mind  how shall I find my dear friends,  shall I be so favored at the hand of  providence, may I indulge the ^one^ hope of  beholding my dear daughter, her  companion & child, in the land of the  living, a whisper I[ anatinept as very]  me that I shall.  I also feel much  interest in the welfare of our dear  son He is with a g by  whose liberality  through the blessing of God we are  enabled to perform thiat Journey which 
 56  has a two gold object vis of visiting  our Children, & of gathering with  the Saints of the last days to ful  fil the Prophets diclaration of  the ancients Prophets That when  the Gentiles should reject the  fulness of the gospel of the Son  of God that he would take stus  same & com among them &  carry it to his ancient covenant people  & that they would [seive ]or it & become  a holy & delightsome people.

 78  PS  A word or two more in explanation   of my remaks at the close of what I have   written, It was the morn, the calf was   killed, I wished to roast a piece &   asked Phebe where it ^was^ carried as I   had not seen it why don't you see it   Mother said she (in quite an angry   tone) & after looking sometime I espied   it on a tree at some distance I do   wish said she Mother you   would take a little more care of   things & liberate me some I feel said   I Phebe that I have a plenty care already &  & quite as much work as I am able   to perform,  I do not exspect to be   able to do more than take close of  my   own family  Indeed I have exected   myself too much already, for my   stength but I must close without   date or hardly dreemy    Sigour Mother 
 Written along right side edge going down the page:  Page  A B C D E F G H I    Son Wilford  having some few things laying  upon my mind in addition to what I have  already exspressed to you in this little book  & feeling that it is the only way in which I can  liberate my mind so as to enjoy comfortable  comfortable feelings I will further say, that  altho I do not calcute to notice so as to lay up  every little trivial circumstance which may  Barn Iasiah      2  receive from time to time in a casual manner  which are not according to the principle of  righteousneys.  Yet permit me to say in the  spirit of love & Christian charity that I do,  Company Mill     1st  Crittenden Amos   b  Rowler Qust           b    & shall exspect, to notice those deviations from  the path of restitude which are calculated in  their nature to produce unhappiness of mind  & uncomfortableness of body, especially when 
 80  a design is evidently connected with a daily  performance of the same for it is indeed  my manner to judge of things according  to this rule, but I do not wish Wilford  to make you any additional trouble or  give you any feelings of an unpleas-  ent nature, & due it not that I do  concider it a duty I owe to are to myself  to open my mind to you in regard  to some things relating to some portion  of the treatment I have received since  I have been journeying with you as  well as to the cause of truth. I would  not disturb your mind with these purp-  lexing things, I am confident you are  not aware of things which do really exist  & that you would not approve of them  for if I believed otherwise I should regret  coming, for I cannot believe that it is the  will of God I should ^suffer^ just such things as  thro this I may be called to suffer greater  ones, I have, & I do exspect to become a  sharve with you not only in the comr 
 common blessings of life, such as food   & rainment, but also in the privations &   hardships which you may be called in the   providence of God to pass through which   journeying to the place of our destination  But, when on a certain day we were journey  ing & it had got be noon and I felt quite faint  & you had stopped, to feed your cattle, I waited   a good while to have some one introduce   the sating some bread & milk but,  the next day I thought I would not  wait again, for I was sure it could  not make any difference as one &   another were getting milk to drink  so I said I would eat a little break  & milk for I felt the need of it, so  Miss King helped me to the same  & asked Phebe which she should get   the last nights milk or mornings, &   she replied, the skim,d milk, I was   astonished, as I knew they had all  as it were been drinking milk all the   morning & new milk too, but I never 
 drink any myself & I felt that it   was truly hard that I must be denied  the privilege of a little good milk & I   said, why, you exspect I suppose[ illegible]  your new milk eat or I should [illegible]  it was better to have the poorest   drand, & the best meat & that for my  part I had a peculiar preference   to new milk  Why said Miss K.  this is good milk, I dipped it out   & I ate it, but exspressed feelings   of not entire satisfaction & Phebe   says, we have calculated for a general  thing to use our nights milk first so   that we can get some cream from the   best I could not understand how they   could raise cream while the milk  was in the waggon, so I enquired of  her, & I also knew that the new milk had   been eaten & drank every after I came   here, & she finally said, Why no, we   don't exspect to set our milk for butter  in the day time, & so it ended leaving 
 me as much in the dark as when I    (Gillet Samuel - 1  Giddings Linus - 3)    commenced the inquiry.  I must  say, I was tried, a day or two after this  becoming way faint before anyone spoke of   eating & as you had stopped, I got some milk  to eat, I helped your father to some also &    (Hurd Willson  strane as it may   (Hart Beaulah)    appear there seemed to be   a dissatisfaction in Phebes mind on account of   the liberty taken, tho nothing was said   in regard to new milk or old milk for I think it   was mixed together, but while father & I was  eating something was said about her   eating some & ^she^ replied that she had been  waiting for others to get through, why said   I Phebe need you wait for me so long as   I bring my own dishes & bread, she replied   that we could not all eat at once & this I  did not then, nor do I now comprehend,   the next thing that presented itself in regard  to milk was that as Sarah had been 
 Dear Son    having some few things  laying on my mind in addition t  what I have already exspressed to y  I will further say, that altho I do no  feel disposed to notice every little  trivial occurrence which may, ha  or shall, hereafter occur in a unusal  manner, & yet permit ^me^ to say, that   I do think I have not myself been  treated in some respects according to   justice & judgement since I have been   in your said midst  I will however   say that I do exspect so long as you I  remain with you to become a sharer in   all the varied sanes which a wiled   omnipotent hand shall see fit to call us   unto whether it be in adversity or prosperity,  in privation & want, or in a state of plenty.  But I do feel that as you have taken  as your Parents with also with the   intention of providing for us the 
 that daughter Phebe should feel  disposed to turn me off with a piece of old  bread for supper which was so hard that   I would not give it[ illegible] to Wilford to eat (as   he asked me just before to give him some).  & especially since I gave what I had the night   before to the family being enough for thier meals  for my family & it was very light, tender &  good too, & Wilford, I did want it, tho, all the fuss  I made about it, was, that I went to the [pandor]  by & helped myself to some new bread, saying   meantime, that I had ^no^ notion of accepting of  such hard bread in exchange for that which   was tender & good, & now I will say, that I could not  have done less than I did without being made   really afflicted with hard feelings such as I  do not like to feel 
 entrusted with the care of the smilk  Phebe preposed in my presence that Sariah should  should be called on to dip out milk for every   one who wanted G I think, I remarked to her  that I thought there might be ^*at the time^ some execpt-  ions to that rule ^for, indeed I was wanting some^ with out destroying the  order of the same for indeed I felt, at once  that I should never be conformed to a rule  like that, which living with my children &  especially when I was as competent to not  only to dip out ^milk^ with as great carefulness  as any one but also to make & take enough   butter in quite as orderly a manner yet  was fucrueted by Sahab, but I was at once  that Phebe intended to suffer any no except  to the rule as she said it would be of no use  to establish such a rule unless it was closly  adharied to by every individual, but for my part  I felt that it might be necessary for the family  in general, especially for men & children at the  particular ones were not subjugated & now I  will say to you that I have not practiced it all since  the time of calling on Sarah for milk & I will I ever of all 
 more butter ^at^ a meal usually than your  father has formu    enou    my reasons.  In the first place I  considered it as unsaint like, & in the next as  unchild like to require me todoso, & in the third  place, I was sure that I should not enjoy anything  in mind if I felt obliged to conform to a rule  like this, I should feel it ^to^ be wrong & only  intly should have hard feelings I this I  do not like to feel towards any friend &  besides, just look at the necessity of your  Mother being conformed, or subject  to such a rule, when the only time I should  have occasion to call on Sarah is at night  & then I am almost surrounded with new  Milk in our Tent every pan just alike  except there should be one not quite as full  as the rest, & in this case, I am sure to know  which it is without going to Sarah but now  Wilford you will see at once that you need not  much disestorment to see that your Mother is  required to take a lower seat than your  sevants, for she is denied privilege that 
 enterested with the can of themilk  Phebe proposed in my busines that Sariah that  they do enjoy, for Sarah of course   forevery  can have the frivilege of getting milk when  & where, & as much as she pleases now  I do think it a little curious, that when  you do have such an abundance of milk  & every one who wishes can drink it when  they please, & as I do not drink any at all, but  only want the privilege of eating a little  with bread, at night as well as at noon,  since itis the case, that Ido not take but  very little supper, of course want a little on  going to bed, a thing which I have preach  -ed a good many years. when I had  milk & when I had not, a little of some  thing else, I say, I do think it curious that  I should be this restricted in regard to  this privilege & in a special manner as  as I have eat but so very little butter  since I have been journeying, & I am sure  that my family have not disposed of 
 more butter ^at^ a meal usually than your  father has formerly made use himself, but,  enough about the aitute, milk, & I will leave this sub-  ject by saying that I do concider it the most an  accountable thing that Pheby, mind should be  led to such a course of treatment towards me un-  less it be a trade in her disposition for I can say in  truth, that I came with all her friendly feelings  towards her, which are necessary to treat one  with every due isprest, & I designed in my  heart to be to her as a Mother, the same as to  Cunice Savr, that I did not calculate, as  she has a number of children, that I  should ^not^ be able to assist in the taking case  of children, neither did I think it necessary  as she was well provided for with help, & I  cannot think Wilford that there was anything  in my demeanour towards Phebe that could  possibly be the occasion of such treatment as I have  in many other instances (which I have not  named) viewed from her hand for indeed  there has been many things tho small in their  nature which have been extremely mortisfying 
 74  to my feelings.  & such things as I have  [heuting you] been an entire stranger unto,  The uncommeitating spirit manifested  by Mis King in regard to cooking [illegible] does I  think bear testimony to the degree of resect by  which I am held, in her estimation ^th them^ & now I  ^& family^ will say, that after all, as much as I sat by this  article milk the principle manifested in the  presence of strangers have wieghed more in  my mind than all the rest, but another  small thing I will just name which hurt my  feelings at the time we had occasion to tarry  over night away from our provisions a little  before you came, Phebe, in reply to my saying  I did not know what we should do in regard  to supper, asked if I had not some bread, I  told her I had a few biscuit she said we would  take them & they would make us some in  the morning if I insisted on it.  The next day that  night as we had not our bread baked for supp to  & Miss King had got hers done & cooked I said  to Phebe that I should like to get some of them  for supper she says, will but as I turned  to go into the tent where the bread was she  enjoined there is a piece of old bread that  ought to be eaten first!  I was struck at the tho 
 that daughter Phebe should feel disposd  to tuson me off with a piece of old bread for  supper which was so hard that I would not  give it to Wilford (as he asked me for some)  a spicially since I gave what I had the night  before to her family being enough for three  heats for my family, & it was very light, tender &  good, too.  & I alsoways feel that good bread makes  every thing good & that which is poor, therewise  & Wilford I did want it, this all the first I made  about it was, to go to the fan don by helped  myself to some new bread , saying meanti-  me, that I had no notion of accepting of such  hard bread, in exchange fo that which was  tender & good,  & now I will say that I would not  have done less than I did without being  miserably afflicted, with hard feelings such  as I do not like to feel, Another thing I will  State, which I think may be asample of thme is  representation which have existed between us  you will rcollect of milking a little one day   at noon for your Joseph & I partook with him  yaco, the manner in which Phebe [inter  liece]  the thing to you, caused me to feel ashamed  of myself, she says, Wilford, Mother, wanted a  little new milk I could not avoid saying that  Phebe designed to have some for Joseph & I said 
 74   to my feelings & such things as I have  beuting you been an entire stranger unto  The uniommetating spirit manifested  by Miss King in regard to cooking & to does I  think bear testimony to the degree of espect by  which I am held in her estimation &by them^ & now I  ^& family^ will say, that after all, as much as I sat by this  asticle milk the principle manifested in the  presence of Strangers has wieghed more in  my mind than all the rest, but another  small thing I will just name which hurt my  feelings at the time we had occasion to tarry  overnight awy from our provisions a little  before you came, Phebe, in reply to my saying  I did not know what we should do in regard  to supper, asked if I had not some bread, I   told her I had a few biscuit, she said we would  take them & they would make up some in  the morning if I insisted on it.  The next day has  night as we had not our breat baked for supp to  er Miss King had got hers done & cooled I said  to Phebe that I should like to get some of them  for supper she says, will but as I turned  to go into the itent where the bread was she  enjoin& there was a piece of old bread that  ought to be eaten first!  I was struck at the that   
 that daughter Phebe should feel disposd  between me off with a piece of old bread for  supper which was so hard that I would not  give it to Wilford (as he asked me for some)  acespecially since I gave what I had the night   before to the family being enough for three  meals for my family, & it was very light, tender &  good too, & I always feel that good bread makes   every thing good & that which is poor, the reverse,  & Wilford I did want it, the all the fuss I made  about it was to go to the pan clon &y helped  myself to some new bread saying meanti-  me that I had no notion of accepting of such  hard bread, in exchange for that which was  tender & good, know I will say that I would not  have done less than I did, without being  miserably afflicted, with hard feelings such  as I do not like to feel. Another thing I will  State which I think may be a samplel of them is  representations which have existed between us  you will recollect of milking a little one da  at noon for your Joseph & I partook with him  was the manner in which Phebe interdlived  the thing to you, caused me to feel ashamed  of myself she says Wilford Mother wanted a  little new milk I could not avoid saying that  Phebe designed to have some for Joseph & I said   
 that I should like a little warm milk  should they be at the trouble to milk some  tho, I had no Idea of having any, & Pheb says  you can have some Mother, I thought her very good   but, did not think it fair her putting the   matter in such a light, for indeed it is not   my principle nor never was my disposition   to require such attentions, tho, I think there  may have been some excatisons to make it   appear that I have been selfish, a trial which   I have never before been accused of & it is my   opinion, that if you Wilford have any feelings in  your breast, that I have [illegible] in my daily   conduct or conversation, from the froth of   rectitude, or wisdom, since I have been in your  midst, It must be ^either^ from a course of such   misrepresentations as was manifest in   regard to the milk or of a similar nature, or   perhaps in connections with some things  of a grosser nature from others, or from the fact  that you & I differ in jugment in respect   to what is right & wrong, you may perhaps  think I lay too much stress upon the manner  of Phebes speaking to you as she did about the    
 Milk, but, just look at the subject for   one moment & concider what your views  sould have been without an explanation, &  tho, the thing in itself concidered was small  yet it is easy to be seen that great things  might come from it, for instance, that shee   was really disposed to make it appear to  your mind that your Mother was very   difficult, notional, & selfish, what better   evidence could she want to present to your  mind, than the fact, that your Mother   required the privilege of having a cow  milked at noon, that she might be accom-  modated with new & warm milk, certainly there  is no one but would concider it an unreason-  able requirement. Well, did not the language  Phe used, convey the Idea in full that I required  this privilege, most certainly it did, but after  all it could not be said in truth that I asked  such a thing, altho, I said, to be sure after  she told me of her intended to have some   milked for Joseph, that I should like  some good warm milk very well, my-  self - But one thing I will suggest, that    
 I have ^had^ newly much occasion of for    Matrimony    thought upon since I have been with you   vis, that of having some rule, or some  whatsaid, whereby I might know what,  & where, such provisions were that you   exspected me & my family to share with   you in, for indeed I have thought strange  that Phebe did not, (unless she had heard   you give the invitation,) just say, Mother   here is this, that & the other perhaps some   beans, a little rice, Pork &c, which we   shall exspect you to help yourselves to,   as you like, but nothing of this sort  has been said to me at any time the   first  I knew about any Beans Phebe gives dir-  ections to have some cooked for her fami-  ily, I felt in a particular manner as if I should  like some to cook, but nothing was said, till  a day or two I then to her that I should  like some beans to cook also. She  replied, you know where they are 
 which was the first knowedge I had  of the beard any way suffice it to say then  I cooked some (soon after this ground there  was rice on board by their making some  pudding of it. but not one word had  been said to me abut helping myself  & family, but I do think Wilford that it  is me more than propper if you expect  I wish your Parents to share with ^you^ in the  comforts you have to give them a general  invitation to help them set up & that too  in the presence of your family for indeed  there is no one, but would feel delicate  in my situation but feel delicate to have  for things in the persence of strangers in  a special manner but you ^may^ be as send  that if Phebe had asked as great exciting  ones taken me helpers to the comforts of  life as she has to keep them from me. I  should not have wanted for any thing  I do think as you assay. to provide for your  Parents on this occasion, that it is no more ^than^  propper I should have the privilege of having  change of so great as have of the Meth as 
 impression from that Betsay 63  Bedfore I came here was full of remarks  against the principles of the church  & that you could not nor would not have  such things, well, I thought it rather  strange that Betsay should exercise  so little wisdome, but I determined  to speak to her on the subject & I did  so but she seemed astonished, I said  she could not remain ^any^ at first of one word  being said on the subject, but finally she said  she did recollect that ^on^ a certain occasion a few  words was exchanged in some what of a [tarfline]  character, by way of argument which amounted to  nothing as it were, but it was spoken openly  in a more said or thought about it as she knew  I was convienced that whoever was instrumental  of making such [illegible]  pression on your  mind was strangely out of the way, but duty  calls me to you ^she also^ of the incident which took place  yesterday morning between Phebe and Betsey, Phebe  came in while we were all about dressing & they  as is very common was cleaning the bed after  I was & bring close by Betsey she happened to 
 throw some of her bigmeared things  onto Betseys bed or to her & Betsey, says  to her (as she afterwards informed me)  I wish you would not throw your dirty  cloaths onto me & as I do not want besmeard  things under my nose, always, This she  said she had often exspressed to Mary   & she would care nothing about it but on this  occasion Phebe being resent her grit was   stirred, & she spoke very short & harshly to Betsey  & threw spring, out to in of her being so part-  icular tha no one might touch her things  Betsey insisted that she had done no more  than to tie up her bed for the sake of convin  ience & to keep it as desent as possibly & also  to have a plan to lay other things onto &  Phebe said, you will throw other peoples  things about, but this Betsey denied a Phebe  said she had been told so, Betsey then asked  the girls if they had told her such things  & they all at one denied telling any such  thing, but Betsey heard, Phebe sying to Mary  you did tell me that Betsey threw off at a  certain time some shitten clouths you put  on her bed three times over but Mary said she  could remember one such thing, of course  the great accersation against Betsey was when  the girls threw shitten cloaths on her bed, that she 
 took the liberty to throw them off, & Betseys  feelings on regard to this subject is similar to  mine viz that  that the more careful we are  to keep our things orderly the better it will be for  their company in general - more I do not know  of but one thing that Phebs can with any  perprinty bring up against me & that is nothing  at all in one sense, but one day, as little Phebe  oders an too, I think come in to the Tent with  some greasy rituals in their hands but  Betseys bed was tied up & any convinient  to sit down on they took seats on it & as she  was absent I felt it duty to call them as I did  that they shouldnot sit with their rituals on  & and Betseys bed, & added, you should never  sit down on other peoples bed, wondering that  I was talking to children but just at that  moment Phebe came in & I can assure you  that she took me to do at a great rate I told her  that I was one of the last persons that ever  practised any [patirulanslief] that would come in con-  trol with any ones comfort or happiness  that I concidered on this occasion that I was  talking to childre, but all did not do, but I do  wonder if Phebe thinks that after all the children  I have taken care of both of our own & Br Ozuns 
 to go to school, &c I concidering my poor  health, as also the abundance of help she   has for the taking care of children, that I   came here with the exspectation of having an  sort of care of her children, I have thoughtf  a good while that if any of my sisters shoul  die & leave young children that I should not   feel it duty to do anything about taking car  of them, but last of all, I must say that I   never in my whole life avoided viewed myself so  Thankfully treated, as she treated me this  morning, as the girls were going to wash   I told father to present his shirts, as I was not   able to do more than wash my own[ illegible]  & tho I might sometimes wash my night  dress 2 shimms & as for Betsey, I have never  expected she would do my washing for she  had not been able to do more than her own for a   good while past, I also had a sheet on my bed   which was got very dirty in the wet weather &   sheet I spoke at being washed, & Phebe hearing a  the waggon sent for Mary & told her they might   wash fathers cloaths, but no more  I went to the   carriage & said to her, that there is a very dirty   sheet on my bed, which I was u[n]able to wash, but  she gave me understand no washing but father   would be done & after saying I thought there was ple 
 of help to do it & she says, how great help.  I replyed, that when she was at our house in   Farmington & I had one wash woman, which came   once in two weeks to wash for me & I had her do   your washing, Phebe replied, she did not do   my clothing, for I did it myself & a great   deal more when I want able hardly, to sit up  Phebe, said &, you did not do your washing   at least not a great deal of it, you might have   done your childs, will you give me the lie   Mother [illegible] she, Phebe said I, I know what   I said to you on the subject, for I told you that   you need not undertake to wash at all, that   Mrs Stone would do it tho if you were[ illegible]  you might do your diapers, & I do know that   Wilford heard me on some occasions tell you   not do do it, you might however done some  part of it, but as for your doing the whole &  much more washing any of my cloaths   you never did it Phebe, she then comes up &   in the presence of Miss King, says, & besides   that, I had to take care of my child when I   want hardly able to get up, & you never pretended   to take it up or take any notice of it good   heavens said I Phebe I was in a glorious good state   to be able to give special time to the taking   care of my child when I had been worn down   to the quick by being up nights & upon a[ illegible]  thro the daytime on account of Ex extreme

 88  the days of the ancient Apostly  to labour with greater [earnistings]  for the duration of the sould of afirmnt  to their deliverance from the reign-  ing power of sin & Satan, than has   your Mother in your Fathers behalf &  I had thought, those seasons of opporti-  tion on account of the same of which there  shared in neat abundance [illegible]  depenating since in again digee  passed a way but I perceive a  seerived of the same in a special  manner since I joined this Camp  which has tended to weigh down  my spirits & to cast a gloom over  my journey to California, but  whatever you may fel to impart  this change in the mind of your Father  unto any one else, I can say in truth  that I know when it commands  by what instrument [illegible] he limplion 
 was presented to his mind, it was  at the time we were looking for your  arrival at Farmington & began to fear  you were Shipwricked, & we both felt  very anxious, but as you did not come  your father said to me one day on  what do you think we shall do if he  should not come, (suming to feel a very  different frame of mind than he had before)  Why, said I, have no doubt but thier  would be some way provided for us but  I should feel it to be a great calamity  whatever might become of us, but I  percieved at once that your father had  or was giving away to quite a new  spirit from what he had for a long  time previous, as he began to explict  upon me for those things & others, for  which I was no more to blame than  I was because you didnot come at  the time appointed & this spirit has  continued to a greater or less degree till  the present time. & when we came to Nauvoo 
 there seemed to be a plenty to feed &   promote this undue & unjust spirit,  every word spoken by myself ever so hone  stly was invested into a bughear & become   a crime worthy of deep censure, & since  I joined the Camp, your father has treated   me with the greatest neglect, indifference,   & hostility, so much as that he has hardly   given me a pleasant word & besides in   one or two instances he has treated me   before company in the most unfeeling   & unreasonable manner as in the case   of three evenings past, the one in which   I dissolved a part of a pill for susane  & wailed on Marys limb which she had  hurt & administered some what to Lars   he being sick, & what was the great   cause, of those dreadful answers I   had why, after I had got through the   doing of good, I seated myself in the   Rocking chair to rest a moment expe-  cting to undress me very shortly but But   had wanted a discloth & I took in my 
 Saunders Oliver  2  Saunders Harry   2    hand a piece of old bed tick to cut off   one or two, while I rested me a little, your   father had got to bed & as is very natural   to him began to speak of my going to bed   I told him I was coming directly but wanted   to sit one moment, &c , but this did not   satisfy but began to frown in a most   unfriendly manner & to accuse me of   such things as a great deal of women   far worse than myself never ought to   be guilty of & that in the presence of   Miss King, Mary & Sarah untill I was   ashamed, yet I could not think neither   can I now, that I had done anything   out of order, or negleglected to do any   thing which I ought to have done & I   felt & do still, that the trials I have   been called to pass through of leaving   Eunice & family with her poor state of   health & extreme poverty, is absuredtly   sufficient for me to grapple with 
 92  without the addition of a repectician  of those trials which I have fomerly  experiences in consequence of an  earnest desire for the salvation of the  soul of my companion, & I deffeel  an assurance that your father cannot  enjoy any good degree of prosperty either  in body or spirit untill he seeks repentance  at the hand of god, & I ahve no more  doubt of his being convinced eer  lings of the unrighteous course  he has persued than I have of any  thing which I am assured will come  Indeed he cannot stand it much  he already fals with the Apostle  Paul that it is hard to kick agaisnt  the pricks I do not wish, nor have  I time to particularize but, when  your father left son Websters house  at bedrim just before he was a  about to take his final leave of his  only Daughter when he designed 
 to spend the night with us &  that without any provceation at all  again intimating that he had been  driven back by opporition & Slander  I tumbled in view of the final wait  to him especially knowing that he would    Wordruff Aphak    2 . 3 - 4 and/2  Woodruff Wilford    3  Woodruff Armon    2  Woodruff Thomson   4  Woodruff Oren   3 = 12  Woodruff Caltha   8    have to retrace this step with sortoud  for in just no one in the house said  a word but myself (save to express  their pleasure at his calling on them)  I am sure that I said nothing but  what was highly proper & not cal-  culated in its nature to injure  any one, & I will now say that there  has been the greatest misrepresent-  ations as to the remarks & feelings  both of myself (both of myself)  & Eunice & Wibster

 574 pounds 16 shillings and one penny.    After regulating the accounts and writing    My Valedictory For the Star    all in the midst of a whirl of business I bade farewell to Elders  Hedlock Ward and Wilson and others around ^and^ with Elder Joseph  A. Stratton I went on board the packet ship Ashburton  of the Swallow-tail line bound for New York with its  passengers and crew.    We hoisted anchor and was towed out  into the channel by a steam tug on the morning of the   23 of January. The tug left us about 15 miles out  and we set sail and went on our course.    My wife and children with a company  of the Saints were crossing the Atlantic for New Orleans on  the ship Liverpool and I now commencing my voyage  accross to New York. It was designed that my wife  with the two children with her should go direct towards Nauvoo  and I by the way of New York to fetch my daughter Phebe  from my wife's sister ^Sarah Foss^ in Sc^arborough^ and also  to take with me to Nauvoo my Father and Stepmother.    Man Overboard    About a week after we set sail during a   roughish day ^storm^ the second mate steped forward to the bow  of the ship and ordered one of the hands to do something on  the bowsprit who refused upon the plea that it was  dangerous and at the risk of his life. The mate replied  that he would not ask a man to do a thing he was not  willing to do himself and forthwith attempted the task  At the same moment we shipped a sea which instantly 
 washed him overboard. The cry of second mate overboard immediately  rang through the ship and ropes were thrown out to him but he  could not get them. The buoy was next flung to him and he swam  hard to reach it but could not as the sea was running so high it  floated to the leeward of him. The captain then gave orders to ^bout^  the ship which was going 8 knotts an hour. This was done as spedily  as possible still it took several minutes to accomplish. The  Life boat was then ^let^ down at the same time and Harry the boatswain  and four other hands maned it. Notwithstanding the high seas  they managed the boat well. The second mate continued to swim  for 15 or twenty minutes in the raging billows even until the  Life boat was within a few rods of him when he instantly sunk  to rise no more. They remained on or near the spot where  he was last seen—both the ship and the boat—but nothing more was  seen of him. The boat then came along-side but it was with   great difficulty they put on board the ship and they came near being  swamped several times    After every exertion had been made they were  oblidg[ed] to trim the sails to the wind and continue their course  leaving the unfortunate mate in his watery grave. The Captain  and crew seemed much affected by the event.    The name of the second mate was William   Drummond an American native of floshing ^Flushing^ Long Island New York  He was a single man had been in the East Indian trade with our  Captain William Holland. This was his first trip in the Liverpool  trade and he was now on his return home. He was a stirring  ambitious young man and it was remarkable with what pleasure  the night before he spoke of taking tea with his mother on his arrval  home. But in the midst of his young ambitious hopeful  life he was suddenly in death burried in his watery grave    Harry the boatsman took the place   of the unfortunate secondmate and soon the ship's company  was sailing on as though nothing had happened. 
 A Strange Story    While on our voyage Elder Stratten related to me  the following narative    I ^"^iIn company with some friends on the 22nd of  October 1845 I went to visit a young maiden who was in a ^kind^   ^of^ trance. She was the daughter of James and Susan Corner ^Comer^  and her own name was Ann Corner ^Commer^. Her parents lived at  the village of Farrington Gurney Sommersertshire England; and   the village is 12 miles from Bath and 15 from Bristol.  Ann was a sprightly child until the age of 12 years at  which time she was take[n] with convulsions and fits for five weeks  Her jaws became locked and eyes closed; she lost the use of her  limbs and was only able to turn her head and raise her hand a few  inches. The last article of food she was ever known to eat was  a small portion of an egg. This was upwards of eight years  ago during which time there has nothing entered her mouth  or passed from her. She breaths through her nose with  regular breathing and her pulse also beats regularly though  quite feble. She has grown about 2 inches in height during  this state looks very pleasant and has a smile upon her  countenance. It is the oppnion [opinion] of some that she is not  insensible and as incredible as the case may seem I could  not find a doubt among any one in the neighbourhood of the  correctness of the statement given me. I pressed her hand  several times and received a light pressure in return. Her  fingure nails have come off three times during the eight  years but at the present time they are perfect. Many  of the first Physicians in Bath have visited her and  some have spent three or four days at a time with her  They have desired to have her removed to the Hospital  but her parents will not alow it and as much as possible 
 the family have tried to prevent the rumour of the case of their  daughter from going abroad.    We Arrive at New York  March the 6th    After a very long ^stormy^ and fatiguing passage of ^43^  days we landed on my native shore thankful enough once  more to put our feet    As soon as we landed brother Stratton Mr  Hastings and myself went to an eating house and got a bo ^dish^  of oysters which we relished very much after so long a trip and   the exhausted ship's fare; but we were more reconcilled to our  hard passage when we found that other ships had passed  quite as long and hard a voyage as ourselves that trys some of  them coming in dismasted and all had suffered much    Elder Stratton started for Nauvoo and   I to Farmington my native place to take my father and  step-mother with me to Nauvoo and thence to find a new  home with the Saints in their exodus to the Rocky Mountains  I reached Farmington on the 11th found all matters concerning  my father and mother as I ^according^ to my expectations but  my Aunt Anna Cossett had died which broke up the ^her^  family. Her daughter Ann was going into a factory Cyrus  to Canton in the blacksmith business which left my  cousin Betsey alone and she desired to go with my  fathers family and the Saints    Leaving Farmington for a season I  started for my wife's father's to fetch my daughter Phebe  whom I found a large fleshy girl.    I reached Saco on the 17th and called  upon my wifes sister whom I found in good health faith  and spirits and with her Phebe her daughter and my child  Phebe whom I soon caught in my arms and kissed 
 I took dinner with my sister-in-law ^Sarah^  Foss and then went with her to Father Carter's in a wagon.  I found my wife's father well and the rest of the family excepting  Mary whom I thought had somewhat failed since I last saw  her. With my father-in-law and others of the family I spent the  night at his house. He told me that the spirit of mother  did often at night visit him. ^visited him almost evey night.^    My wife had given me as her last request  that her father should be baptized and receive the Priesthood at  my hands before I left him and thus I communicated to  him. He said that he had desired at times to be baptized   and thought he would at this time if I stayed over another  day but next morning he was reluctant as the water  was frozen &c so I thought it best to start on my journey  that day as I was so late in the season and our people had  to leave Nauvoo that Spring    Father Carter was 73 years of age that  very day. Before I bade him farewell we visited together  mother's grave walking on the crust of snow that covered  the ground but her grave was bare. The old man  pointed to a spot beside it and said "that place will  soon be my bed." I took some pebbles from the grave  to carry to Phebe.    At our parting our aged father  was much affected and wept. He sent his best parental  love to his daughter and wished me to say to her that he   was a firm beleivedr in the Book of Mormon and the  faith of the Latter-day Saints and that as soon as he saw  his way clear he would endeavour to be baptized    I arrived at Farmington on  the 9th and we commenced directly our packing  and arrangements for our journey 
 Farewell To My Native Place    We arose early on the morning of the 23 of March  to start on our journey to Nauvoo. We took breakfast and bade  farewell to the town of Farmington and the inhabitants thereof  Our company consisted of my father mother and cousin Betsey  Cossett with myself and little daughter Phebe    It was a pleasant morning. We rode to   New Britain in a waggon and when we were on the top  of the mountain I cast my eyes back upon my native place  I gave to it a final and probably my last adieu    We did not get to the station in season  for the passenger train so we took the baggage train to   New Haven. Here I found Elder ^Bro^ Adams from Springfield  and he went with me to the United States Riffle Factory  and I bought four riffles with extra barrels    After the various incidents usual  on such a journey we arrived in Nauvoo on the 13th of  April. We stoped at Keokuk for an hour and at  about 2 o'clock we started to assend the Rapids. In  about 2 hours we came in sight of the Temple and  the city of Nauvoo. I immediately got my spy glass  and took    A View in the Distance of the City  and Temple which to my eyes looked truly splendid    The boat stoped at Montrose and  then crossed to Nauvoo at the upper landing. I soon  got a waggon and took my friends to my house where I had  the happy privilege of again meeting my dear wife and  children who arrived only a few days before me having also  like myself had a long voyage accross the ocean being 9 weeks  and fourteen days on the passage 
 [top of page blank]    When I arrived at Nauvoo I found the Saints    [bottom of page blank] 
 Dedication of The Temple  of the Lord in Nauvoo    April the 30th 1846    In the evening of this day I repared to the Temple and  with Elder Orson Hyde and about 20 others of the Elders of Isreal all  dressed in our Priestly robes we dedicated the Temple of the Lord built  unto His most Holy Name by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints. Notwithstanding the prophesies of Sydney  Rigdon and others that the roof should not go on and the House  of the Lord be finished and the threats of the mob that we should  not dedicate it we had finished the work of the Temple of   God and now dedicated it to his most holy name ^him^. After the  dedication we raised our voices in the united shout of Hosanna to  God and the Lamb.    After our dedication and the offering up of   our prayers for the Camp of Israel and that we might not be disturbed by  any mob during our further services of dedication we returned to our  homes thankful for the privilege which we had enjoyed in our evenings  service.    Public Dedication  of the Temple of the Lord  May the 1st 1846    Next On this day we met for a public dedication  of the Temple and on entering each paid one dollar to clear the   debt upon it and pay the hands who had built it. I paid seven 
 dollars for my company who were seven in number consisting of myself wife father  mother cousin ^and others^    I opened the meeting by prayer and was followed with remarks  from Elder Orson Hyde who also offered up the dedication prayer. Afterwards  Elder Almon Babbit was called upon to address the meeting which he did much  to the edification of the assembly.    On Sunday the 3rd the dedication was continued.  The Saints began to assemble at an early hour and at ten o'clock the house  was well filled. Orson Hyde myself and Elder Stratton occupied the upper  stand.    After ^the^ singing Elder Stratton opened the service by prayer  and then Elder Orson Hyde arose and addressed the congregation from  the passage of Scripture:    "What is man that thou art mindful of him  or the Son of man that thou visiteth^est^ him"    After Elder Hyde had closed I addressed the   assembly and the meeting desmissed and the dedication of the Temple  ended.    On the 7th I had an interview with John Taylor  who had returned to the City to settle his business and next day went  over the river to the camp and on the following one our company from  the east arrived with our baggage    On the Sunday I received several letters  one of which was from President Brigham Young from the Camp  of Israel and another from Elder Elijahsha H Davis from London    I went to the Temple at an early hour  and found the house filled. Elder Phelps opened by prayer and   I addressed the congregation ^from the words of Solm. There is a time for all things &c^ and was followed by Elders ^Amos^ Fielding  Benjamin Clap and others. This was    The Last Time I Preached  in the  Temple of the Lord at Nauvoo. 
 Next day I crossed the river to Montrose  and bought 2 yoke of oxen and Paid 50 dollars per yoke and then  drove them up to the camp where my waggons were and during several  following days I was busy at home preparing for my journey    I left Nauvoo on the 16th and crossed the  Missisippi with my wagons and family and camped about one mile from  Montrose where also Orson Hyde was camped. I was very weary with  the continued and unceasing exertions which I had for months been making both  before and after my return to Nauvoo to follow with my family the body of the   Church to find a new home.    The next day was one of the most perplexing  of my life. I had on the ground three baggage waggons one family  carriage six yoke of oxen six cows 4 calves one yearling and a pair  of mules making in all 25 head. I started to go to the Black Jack  Grove to Camp. The whole care was upon myself. As soon as we had  started the cows and calves all ran various ways and while I was trying  to get them together the oxen broke the tongue out of my carriage  After  that was mended by leaving part of our stock we got started but we had  not gone far before my father drove into a mud hole and the oxen  mired down. We put on 8 yoke of oxen to draw the waggon  out but we could not and broke four chains in the attempt. We  had to dig the waggon out at last and finally got camped at Black  Jack Grove very weary though we had made ^but^ four miles.    I returned to Nauvoo on the morrow  and sold our prairie land for goods and next day crossed the river to Montrose  and had an interview  with a company of Saints from Pennsylvania  and among them was Brother Sidwell who gave to Brother Orson Hyde  seven hundred dollars for the Camp $100 for himself and $100 for me    I again returned to Nauvoo and arranged  some business. Here I saw Mother Woodruff my sister Eunice and   her husband and Mother Smith together and some unpleasant feelings  were manifested upon the subject of Strang and his followers. I  parted with Eunice and her husband for the last time and again 
 crossed the river and road^rode^ to the Camp a distance of 20 miles    I rode to Montrose next day and got my goods. I had  to pay 100 dollars on my patent flouring mill and 70 for freightage. I returned  to the Camp where I spent the next day.    Adieu to Nauvoo    I was in Nauvoo on the 22nd for the last time and  left this city of the Saints feeling that most likely I was taking a final farewell  of it in this life. I looked upon the Temple and city as it receded  from me and I asked the Lord to ^remember^  preserve it as a monument of the  sacrifices of His Saints.    I returned to Camp Painted my ^waggon covers^ and prepared for  my journey during the several following days and struck our tents on  the 25th and drove to Charlestown where we camped for the night. Here  I remained in Camp during the next day. as I had taken cold and  felt quite lame and had a few days before sprained my sholder and thumb  among the cattle. Brother H. Clark J Townsend and many others passed  us during the day and brother Smoot came up and camped with us for  the night.    My Father Nearly Killed    Just before we stoped to camp on the 27 a serious accident  happened to my father. He went to get into the waggon while  the oxen were travelling and the foreboard which he had taken hold  of gave way. He fell instantly upon his back and  both wheels of the   waggon loaded with 25 cwt passed over his legs and arms and came  near passing over his head. I expected at first that it had killed  him but we soon found that it had not nor broken any bones though  it had badly brused his flesh.    We journeyed to Farmington next day. Here the   whole of the company bought their flour—I bought 4 barrels—and then we 
 crossed the Desmoin River at the Farmington Ferry and went four miles and  camped. We were now twenty five miles from Nauvoo    We lay still through the next day and I reloaded  my teams ^waggon^ and sent back to Farmington for sundry articles. Father was  quite lame but doing well considering how badly he was injured    Several days after we overtook the Ramus Company   of about 25 waggons and on the next I went to Bloomfield and bought   two more yoke of cattle for which I paid $20 for one yoke and $30  for the other.    Sunday the 7th we killed our last calf and  in the afternoon travelled till sundown when we came to a long  swail one mile and half across. This was the worse piece of road  we had passed. My carriage and family went through it and  I got my waggons half through by dark when the wheels of my  waggon cut to the hub in turf and mud and with 8 yoke of   cattle I could not get through and two of my waggons remained  in the swamp all night. My cousin Betsey was in one of  then and remained all night. I was in the mud and water  up to my knees till 2 o'clock and among the cattle nearly all   night. At daylight I rolled myself up in a Buffaloo robe and   got some sleep and we rested through the day both man and   beast.    We travelled 20 miles next day and camped  near the Macedonia Company consisting of 31 waggons and travelled  with them through the following day an^d^ at night I called the  camp together and addressed them.    Next morning I started the company according  to our organization. We passed through a bad swail and my men broke  another tongue out of my waggon. We went to timber cut a stick and   put in a new one and camped for the day    We journeyed on for the next few days  passing camps of the Saints and holding occassional connection with other  families on the road and on the 15th of June we arrived at the 
 Camp of Israel called Mount Pisgah. I had an interview with brothers Charles C. Rich  and Huntington the President and Council at Mount Pisgah and many other  friends. I encamped on the east side of the creek and the Camp of  Israel. Here I learned that Brother Noah Rogers who had just returned from  a mission to the South Sea Islands was dead and the first person burried  in the burrying ground at Mount Pisgah. Bro Turnbow one of our company  also lost a child to day. I attended to its burrial on the morrow and  visited the encampment.    The day after I rode through the encampment  to buy a ton of flour to fit out my company. I rode thirty miles and   was sick at night and continued unwell next day but rode a good part of the  time. I went to see Lorenzo Snow who had been quite sick. I administered  to him and he was relieved    The following day I got home my flour. I bought  for myself 16 80 lbs at 3 cts per lb and also some for brother Blanchard and  Sanders and the next day I had a thorough overhauling of my loads and  repacking. I left a number of chests barrels &c    On the Sunday the 21st I preached to a large  congregation of the Saints on Mount Pisgah and enjoyed the spirit of  God and was followed by Elders Huntington Rich Benson and Sherwood  We had a good meteting. Some assistance was called for to help me  off. Some money was donated and oxen and waggons promised    After meeting an express came from the  President at Council Bluffs requiring 100 mounted men as dragoons  for a guard and Buffalou Hunters for the Camp of Israel.    Next evening I met the people to raise  the 100 volunteers of mounted men and addressed the assembly on the  importance of complying with the request made and assisting the Twelve  and those associated with them to go to the Mountains and lift  up the Standard of Zion. I then called for the volunteers and  about 60 followed me out in the line. We appointed the next   evening to meet again at which time we met and afterwards wrote  to the President reporting what we had done in the matter. 
 The Call For Five Hundred Volunteers  by President Polk    On the 26th our Camp was thrown into some excitement  by the appearence of JCapt. J. Allen with 3 drggoons of the US. army  I soon met Bro Huntington and his council with Capt Allen to enquire  into his business and he informed us that he was sent by order of   Capt Col Kerney who had been instructed by President Polk to give  the Mormons an invitation to raise five hundred volunteers  to assist the United States in the Mexican War. We treated  the agent courteously and directed him on to Council Bluffs to lay  the matter before the President Young.    Next day I received a letter from  President Young and wrote him one and sent him a messenger before  the troops.    I was unwell on the Sunday yet I preached  to the Saints at Mount Pisgah and had an interview with Elder  Clayton and next day I gathered my company with their cattle  and waggons together and bid adieu to the friends at Mount   Pisgah and travelled on.    When I started from Mount Pisgah I had  six waggons one carriage sixteen yoke of oxen 7 cows 2 mules and   one horse in all 42 head    After we had completed building a new bridge  over the creek by ^when^ we camped at the end of our first days journey  from Mount Pisgah we gathered up our cattle and started on our way    I stoped my carriage on the top of a  rolling prarrie where I had a fine view. I could stand and gaze  to the east west north and south and behold the Saints pouring out and  gathering like clouds from the hills and dales groves and prairies  with their teams waggons flocks and herds by hundreds and thousands  It looked like the Moving of a Nation 
 Call For the Pioneers    After travelling a few miles on the 1st of July we were  visited by Elder Parley P. Pratt who was direct from Council Bluffs and was  a Messenger to all the Camp of Isreal. I formed a circle of about 50 waggons  and he delivered his errand. He was sent to raise a company of  men as pioneers to go immediately to the mountains without their families  to pick out a location and put in Spring and fall crops. The quorum of  the Twelve had volunteered to go    After we got our message I drove ahead as fast as  possible with my teams. We travelled 20 miles with our ox waggons  and camped at about 10 o'clock at night man and beast wearied out.    Next day we journeyed till 7 o'clock at night  and on the following one was overtaken by Brother Parley returning in   company with Brother Benson who had been nominated to fill the place  and wear the crown of John E. Page.    Brothers Pratt and Benson wished me to return  accompany them to the Bluffs so I saddled my horse and started with  them.    Village of the Pottawattime Indians.    It was interesting to be once more with brother Parley  and to add to the interest of our day's ride we passed through the  main village of the Pottawatamie Indians. This was the first  time in my life I had ever passed through a large villiage of  Indians.    After viewing the Indians and their village  awhile we continued our journey and rode until dark then  unsaddled our horses and made our bed in the grass on  the side of the hill but the musketoes soon routed us out  We had to go to the top of the hill where we again laid  down and spent the night in the wind and in the morning  I felt quite stiff and sore. 
 Next day was the 4th of July—Independence day  We arose saddled our beasts and rode about 10 miles and took breakfast  with some brethren and as we had no supper the night before our appetites  were good. Here we were informed that President Brigham Young  Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards were but a short distance  from us encamped and were on their way to Mount Pisgah. We  immediately rode down to them and it was truly a happy meeting  and I rejoiced once more to st[r]ike hands with these noble men for  it was the first time we had met since I left Nauvoo on my  mission to England in 1844 soon after the martyrdom of Joseph and  Hyrum    Brother Brigham and his companions Heber  and Willard insisted that I should return with them so brother Benson  myself and several of the Life guard returned until I met my family  and company and I had the privilege of introducing to the brethren  my father and others. After spending a little time together they  continued their journey to Mount Pisgah to raise the five hundred  volunteers for the service of the United States. I tarried with  my family. I had ridden about 50 miles already that day and  was exceedingly sore and stiff and almost sick.    The Sunday followed and we continued   to journey slowly through the day and on the next evening we  camped at the same place where I had camped with Parley in  the grass. An Indian Chief camped near us with some  squaws. The Indian said he was going to meet with Mormons  and smoke the pipe of peace.    Early next morning some 50 Indians  said to belong to the Sioux passed our camp for the east.  They said they were going to meet the Mormon Chief. We   supposed they ment President Young who had gone to Mount  Pisgah. They were noble looking Indians    We laid by this day to let our cattle  rest. I was called upon to administer the ordinance of the Church 
 to sister Grant and she had a daughter born in five minutes after I left. Thus  children were born unto Israel in the wilderness and by the way side as in the  days of old    Next morning we continued our journey and came   along side of the General encampment at Council Bluffs at about noon.  I saw the encampment of some of the Twelve and had an interview with  Elders Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor and many other friends.    I pitched my tent and camp on a bluff near   Elders Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor. It rained hard at night.    In the evening we held a council about raising  the 500 volunteers for the President of the United States to go to Upper  California and for the Mexican war    Visit From Col. Kane    I spent the 11th in Camp assisting to gather  the Volunteers. We had a visit from Col. Kane from the city of  Washington confirming the declaration that President Polk had sent   for five hundred Mormon Volunteers. He informed us that the  President was very favourable to our people and that he had taken this  course for our good. Col. Kane manifested the spirit of a gentleman  and much interest in our welfare.    From the information received from   Col. Kane ^him represented^ we were convinced that God had begun to move upon the  heart of the President and others of the nation to act for our interest and  the general good of Zion. The object of Presedent Polk was to enlist  500 of the Latter-day Saints and feed cloth[e] and pay them and  let them go direct to California via Santa Fe and take possession  of that country and prepare a way for the body of the Church  to come which would make them the first settlers of that  country.    Elder Taylors company was encamped on the  south of the chime ridge or Redemption Hill and mine on the north 
 about 5 rods apart. Elder Parley P. Pratt was ten rods north of my company  We built a bowery between Elder Taylor's ten and my own and a large  assembly of the Saints met at an early hour the first Sunday after  I arrived at Council Bluffs. I was called upon to address them  and give an account of my travels through England Scotland Wales  which I did for about the space of an hour. Parley P. Pratt and  John Taylor and others followed particularly taking up the subject  of the volunteers for the United States and the expedition to California    Next day which was Monday the 13th  President B. Young H. C. Kimball and Willard Richards  returned from Mount Pisgah and we met in council. All  of the quorum was present except Lyman Wight. Col  Kane was present.    On the following day also the Twelve  met in council and then a general meeting of the Camp of   Israel was called when three companies of one hundred each  volunteered for the California service. Several measures were  entered into by the Twelve. At the close of the business of  the day a concert of music was called on Redemption Hill and  some felt so well they danced.    A Special Mission to England    On the 15th I met in council with the quorum of  the Twelve and we passed the resolutions that Elders Orson Hyde  Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor go to England forthwith and  remove Reuben Hedlock from office and also Thomas Ward  and call them to America and regulate all the business of the   British Mission    The enrolment of the companies for  the service of The United States in the Californian expedition  had been prompt and strongly characteristic of the loyal  spirit of our people. Notwithstanding the ill treatment 
 and sufferings we had endured in the persecutions yet while in the midst of   a long journey we steped forward as a people at once at the call of our country  The President of the United States asked us for 500 volunteers for the service  of the Mexican war and instantly the men steped forth at the call    The Mormon Battaliaon    The 16th was a great day in the Camp of Israel and important  to the whole Church. Four companies of the volunteers were organized   and ready for marching. They were brought together and formed into a   hollow square by their Captains and then addressed by several of the  quorum of the Twelve in a very suitable manner    The March    At the close of the address the Battalion commenced  its march in double file from Redemption Hill for seven miles  across the Missouri River Bottom to the Ferry. The brethren  who formed these companies had left their families teams and waggons  and cattle standing by the way side not expecting to meet them again  for one or two years. Yes here by the way side they left their  wives and children to the mercy of God and their brethren but they  went away with cheerful hearts beleving they were thus doing the will  of God. As I viewed them I considered that I was looking  upon the first Battalion of the army of Israel engaged in the service  of the United States.    Ordination of Ezra T. Benson to the Twelve  ^(July 16)^    After the march of the Battalion the quorum of the  Twelve met in Council and ordained Ezra T Benson to fill the place  of John E. Page as a member of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
 Some other business was also attended to and then in company with  the Twelve I rode across the bottom and we returned home and they took supper  with me.    Next day I met in council with my quorum  and then we called a general meeting of the people to transact business  Men were called upon to go to work on the road at the ferry. About  20 volunteered. Ninety men were also appointed to act as Bishops  to take charge ^of the famlies^ of those who had volunteered for the Californian  service.    At the close of the meeting in company with  President Young the Twelve and others we left Redemption Hill  Council Bluffs and rode 5 miles to the French and Indian Village  and Mills. We then took the Indian trail across the ridges bluffs  hills and dales on the road that Emmit travelled to big Pigeon. Here  we camped for the night with some of the Saints who had arrived  two hours before us. This was the first Mormon camp on the  Big Pigeon    Next morning I arose took breakfast and then  went to examine the Big Pigeon which I found well supplied with good  fish. I returned to the waggons and then with the Twelve to Redemption  Hill but a company of six men crossed the Big Pigeon to explore  the country.    With Mrs Woodruff I rode to the encampment  near the Ferry to see the Mormon Battalion of 500 men who were  making preparations to start on their journey to California President  Young called the officers of the company together and gave them  good counsel concerning their march to their destination. After  this instruction to the officers they were dismissed and a concert  was given to Col. Allen in the afternoon and we returned  home in the evening    On the Sunday we met assembled at  the usual place of meeting and the people were addressed by  Elders Parley P. Pratt John Taylor and myself and at the close 
 of the meeting 40 persons came forward and joined the Volunteers to fill  up the companies.    Appointment of the High Council at Council Bluffs  July the 21st    I met with the quorum of the Twelve on the morning of the 21st andwe  appointed 12 men with Father Morley as their head to act in the capacity   of a High Council to take charge of affairs at Council Bluffs while the  quorum of the Twelve go on to the Island ^f establish Winter Quarters^    On the 23 I crossed the river Mo. to the  camp to attend a council with the Twelve but they had gone to Elkhorn and  did not return until the evening so our council was put off unto the  the next day when we met on a high prairie ridge. Eleven of our  quorum were present. We put on our robes and offered up our prayers  to God conversed upon principle and decided that no man has a right to  attend to the ordinance of sealing except the President of the Church or those   who are directed by him so to do and that the ordinance should be confined  to Zion or her stakes. This was the last council we were expected  to hold together before the departure of Elders O Hyde P. P. Pratt and  John Taylor for England    We had an interesting time in our council  and at the close Brother Parley, George A. and John Taylor started for  our camp at the Bluffs. We rode part of the way to the river in a  carriage and then I walked with Brother Parley and took skiff and rowed  over the river and then started for home but in taking a near road across  a slough in the dark we missed our way and wandered some time in the  dense weeds willows bushes &c. We at last found our road and arrived  at brother Pratts tent in the bottom where I parted from him and lost  my way ^again^ going to the Bluff but arrived at last at my tent at 10 o'clock  very weary having walked about 12 miles after sundown    Next day I got together my teams early in  the morning and started for the ferry to cross but found Brother 
 Pratt before me with twelve wagons and as it took the whole day to get these  over I had to remain with mine on the bank until the morrow when  we commenced about sunrise to take our cows over with a skiff by  tying their heads to the boat and rowing them over. We took over   twenty thus and also some oxen and as we had not enough men I took  one of the oars myself and assisted in ferrying in the hot sun and  then drove teams up the hills through the mud and when I got  through my days work I felt hardly able to stand up and nex[t]  day we were all unwell in consequence of fatigue    I continued unwell also on the following  day but attended a council of the Twelve and dined with Dr  Willard Richurds    Suddenly a thunderstorm struck us.  The water beat through our waggon covers and the wind drove our  family carriage down a steep hill turned it bottom side upward  and smashed the top to pieces but providentially there was  no one in it and everything was saved ^that was in the carriage medicine bottles and all^ but the bottles in the carriage   Very heavy thunderstorms continued during the night and the beds  bedding and family was drenched and several tents in the camp  torn down    Winter Quarters Decided  August the 2nd    The council of the Twelve met on this Sunday afternoon  and decided that Winter Quarters of the Camp of Israel should  be located near where we then were    A messenger had just arrived from the  Mormon Battalion within 30 miles of Fort Leavenworth. He gave  a good report of the brethren who were all well and doing  honour to the cause    During the evening President Young  and Dr Richards called at my tent and President Young addressed  us upon the Priesthood and the principle of sealing. There 
 were present Phebe W. Woodruff Caroline Barton Sarah Brown and  Mary Jackson.    I was now surrounded by two or three hundred  waggons belonging to the Camp of Israel but I had been so busy in our  journying caring for cattle &c and so few men to assist according to the  amount of labour that I had not been able to devote so much time  to my Journals necessary to do them justice in keeping a record of the  exodus from Nauvoo of this great people and their travels in the  wilderness towards the Mountains    On the 3rd I travelled 9 miles with my  company and camped for the night. Col. Kane camped with  me and his horse ran into my tent tore it badly to pieces  and broke all the poles    Next day I travelled with President Young's  company 9 miles and camped on a prairie ridge near the timber  and on the following one rode with the Twelve and others to  view the timber and find a place of encampment and on  the next again met in council with the Twelve after which  we rode out and enjoyed a pleasant day    Winter Quarters Organized  August 7th    We held a public meeting in the Camp of Israel  on this day and chose twelve men as a High and  City Council to transact all business appertaining to the  settlement during the winter    We also held a consultation with  Col. Kane and some important things were said and  a resolution formed to address certain resolutions to  President Polk expressive of our gratitude for his kindness  to the Latter-day Saints in his design of arming and  planting 500 of Volunteers from us to take possession of 
 of California and for our good and also urging against Governor Boggs  being Governor of California and Oregon as his friends were trying  to make him    President Young informed Col. Kane that our  intention was to settle in the Great Basin or Bear Valley and  that a Territorial Government would be petitioned for as soon as  we got settled.    We rode out in the evening and pitched  upon a location in a valley the east side of the timber.    On the Sunday a large congregation of  the Saints assembled in their new meeting place in the valley  sellected for Winter Quarters. The Stand and seats sufficient  to hold about 300 were made the evening before. I was called  upon to address the congregation which I did about an hour  and was followed by several of the Elders and then President  Young closed with an interesting address. He said he  did not expect to see the Rocky Mountains that year but when  the Lord commanded him to go direct he intended to go if he  left all and went alone but thought the Lord would let him  take the People with him. When he found the place for  the Temple he would work hard until it was built.    In the evening I met in council with Presidents  Young Willard Richards and others until about 12midnight and  we drew up a plan of the encampment.    Next day my company and I was  engaged in building a fence around my encampment and I also  met with the High Council    Forming the Encampment No 1.    The following day was the eleventh of August  when the whole of President Young's company moved from  where it was on to another prairie ridge. This was 
 company No I. I^t^ was only seperated from company No II by a valley  of about 50 rods. Heber C. Kimball was the Captain of No 2.    We formed a hollow square with an L  of about 350 waggons in encampment No 1, and then built a strong fence  as an enclosure of the whole. The fence was built five rods from  the waggons and the waggons were placed mouth fronting the Square  The encampment made a fine appearence and we had a busy  day in setting it in order.    Next day was a busy day for me and my  company in building a fence for our cattle and looking them up. I also  met in council with the Twelve and we had a public meeting in  Encampment No 1 when the encampment was devided into eleven divisions  and numbered. My company formed the 10 Division. The  meeting was held in the hollow square    My Division    The following is a copy of the form of my division of  Encampment No 1 President Young    August 12th 1846    Cutlers Park Omaha Nation    The roll or memorandum of the men and boys; number of waggons  horses oxen cows mules and sheep belonging to the Tenth Division    Wilford Woodruff captain  John S.

Porter Rockwell arrived in Camp on the 17th  and brought the mail from Nauvoo. I received one paper and  learned that the mob spirit was still alive in Hancock Co.  and that they were mobing whipping and killing ^the Saints^each other.   The Saints ^who^ were leaving as fast as they could and the new  citizens had taken the matter in hand and the war was now  between them and the mob. Porter Rockwell was kept in  jail as long as they could keep him and when brought to court  no one appeared against him.    During our sujorn in the wilderness  Mrs Woodruff had been tried severely in her health and it required  great care to preserve her in life.    On the morning of the 20th I carried Mrs Woodruff  in her carriage into a deep vale of a shaded grove to spend the day  away from the noise and bustle of camp in solitude for her health    I returned and met in Council with the   Twelve and 3 of the High Council from the Bluffs—namely Isaac  Morley J. H. Hale and P. Richards. We spent the forenoon  in doing business for the benefit of the people.    In the afternoon the two High Councils  and the Twelve resolved into one council for the day. We heard 
 a report from Bro Griffin from the Pawnee village stating that about 20 waggons  would spend the winter there, 160 waggons had gone on with brother Miller to  the Punkas village with ten chiefs to spend the winter. The Pawnees  numbered about 4000 men woman and children. The Punkas are a part of   the Sioux nation    News From the Mormon Battalion    Our Messenger to the Mormon Battalion had returned and we also  heard his report. All was well with them. They were getting  praise and fame wherever they went. A mail was brought in from   them.    We conversed upon the subject of a mail route. President  Young suggested the propriety of employing some of the Omahas to  watch our cattle &c. We also met in the evening and passed resolutions  concerning cutting hay sowing turnips &c.    On the 22nd in company with the  quorum of the Twelve I rode to the Mo. River crossed the Ferry  and on to Council Point where there was an encampment of  from 40 to 50 waggons we found many sick.    Sunday the 23rd we assembled a congregation  of the Church at Council Point to give instruction to the Saints  concerning sending the money received from the army and all money  in their hands to St Louis to buy goods and clothing for their outfit  the next spring. President Young H C. Kimball G A. Smith  A Lyman O Pratt and W. Woodruff spoke and then it was  voted that the monies be appropriated according to counsel  in the purchase of goods clothing &c    We found many sick at this place and  after a lengthy meeting we laid hands upon them and rode  to Redemption Hill.    Next day seven of the Twelve—B Young  H. C Kimball O Pratt W. Richards W. Woodruff G. A Smith and 
 A Lyman rode 5 miles to Mr Henry Millers and had a feast of mellons  corn and vegatables and then returned to Redemption Hill and crossed  Musketoe Creek on to Perkins' Camp over hills and dales. Here we spent  the night and on the morrow buck to Redemption Hill and thence  to Council Point where we found many upon whom we had laid  our hands recovering from their sickness    Next day we rode to the Mo. River and   crossed the ferry. Two of the Omahas were with us to the Cold  Spring and they shot their pointed arrows to divert us. At the  Cold Spring we saw Erastus Snow and several families. From  thence we rode to the Camp of Israel and saw on our way the  Omaha Village or lodges which was quite a picteresque view  We carried home to our families some vegatables.    On our return to the Camp we found the  people much improved in health but we also found an evil in the   Camp. A man by the name of Barnum not a member of the   Church had joined with other young men in spending their time  at nights in fiddling and dancing and afterwards leading away young  woman into folly and wickedness    In Council with Two Tribes of Indians    August the 27th    I met with the Twelve and High Council with two  tribes of Indians. The object was to get permission to stay  on the land that season and to use wood grass and water for  two or three years or as long as we wished while gathering to the  mountains.    We first met with the Otoes between whom  and the Omahas there was a dispute as to who owned the land  The Otoes said the land was theirs. The chief with five  or six others were present. We talked to him and   he went home. 
 We afterwards all met in Council with the Omahas. The old  chief's name was Big Elk and his son a young chief called Young Elk. There  were also present about 60 old men and braves of the tribe. As it was late  the Council was adjourned until the morrow. We then met in  council among ourselves and did some business and among other things  appointed 3 men to buy up the cattle and sell beef. They were  Lorenzo Young, C D. ^P.^ Lott and A Cutler.    Privilege of the Land Granted by the Indians    August the 28th    We met in the morning with the Omahas chiefs and  braves in Council. We smoked the pipe of peace and then  President Young spoke to them through their interpreter. He told  them it was our desire to winter there and that if they wished we  would do some work for them—make them a field fix their  guns &c and said many other things which I did not report.  The Big Elk replied:    "My Son, Thou hast spoken well. I have  all thou hast said in my heart. I have much I want to say  We are poor. When we go to hunt game in one place we meet an  enemy, and so in another place. Our enemies kill us. We do not  kill them. I hope we will be friends. You may stay on these  lands two years or more. Our young men may watch your  cattle. We would be glad to have you trade with us. We will  warn you from^of^ danger from other Indians."    Much more was said by Big Elk. The  Council closed and the Indians were fed and returned home.    On Sunday we held meetings in the  Camp of Israel and on the Monday B. Young H. C. Kimball  Willard Richards W Woodruff George A Smith and A Lyman  of the Twelve with others started in search of Council Bluffs  we had a pleasant day's ride and we all enjoyed ourselves well 
 excepting that I suffered from caker in the mouth. We rode over hill and dale  about 25 miles and camped 12 miles above the Bluffs    The Old Council Bluffs    September the 1st. We arose washed prayed breakfasted  and started down the river to find the Bluffs. We came to a creek and  had to build a bridge before we could cross. The Indian trail went up  the Bluff which was the road to be taken but as we didhad no guide  we kept the table land under the bluff.    We passed through a flat about two miles  across covered with pea vines grass weeds and cane from five to ten  feet high. We had to wallow through without ^our^ horses an  waggons. Four of us finally climbed the bluff and traced the trail  back to the bridge we made and then returned to the horsemen and  waggons. There were 10 of the former and three of the latter.    We came to another creek which we had to  bridge and after crossing it on to another flat of about 600 acres  and here we found Council Bluffs at ^near^ sundown    There was nothing standing of the old Barracks  except the body of the Magazine with one gable end made of  brick arched over. We walked to the edge of the bluff. Before  us on the bottom appeared a small grove of willows beyond it a small  stream of muddy water and in the distance a dense mass of Cottonwood  and Willow. I started up a deer a few rods of me   and we tried to get a shot at him but could not. A wolf also went  into the forest before us.    W After looking about the premises of the  old Council Bluffs about an hour and seeing nothing inviting  we started on our return and after travelling about a mile  we found a good spring and camped for the night. Near  this place we started up a deer and the horsemen gave chase  but lost him. There were signs of deer and elk very 
 plentiful. Both man and beast of the company were very weary having ^going^  through such heavy bottoms    Next day we arose prayed and started for the Camp  of Israel which we reached in about 10 miles from the Bluffs    On the following evening I was in Council with   the Twelve and High Council and Orson Pratt wass called upon to report the  visit to the Otoes and Omahas. He reported that the Otoes would not  give a decesion until they came to the Camp and gave a dance. The  Omahas wanted also to come and give a war dance on their way to war  with the Sioux. The report was accepted and Brigham Young made  a report of our journey North.    Brothers O Pratt H C. Kimball P. Rockwell  J. M Grant, Eldridge myself and others on the 5th went in search  of a new ferry. We travelled down the Missouri River  five miles on the Bluff and saw many hops elderburies and grapes, killed  one turkey and saw two deer    We had brought with us a leather boat in  which we crossed the river with seven persons in it. Here we met  a committee from Council Point who was upon the same business as  ourselves. This committee was composed of Bishop Morley Harris  Miller Richards and others some of whom returned with us    Several of us spent some time in picking  grapes of which were picked 2 bushels and after making a bridge  across a creek we started for home    Col. Kane Receives His Patriarchal Blessing  Sept. the 7th    Col. Kane called upon me at my tent for the last  time to day as he was about to leave for the east. He had been  sick for several weeks but was now getting well. Before he left  he desired to receive his Patriarchal Blessing under the hands  of Father John Smith. I went with him to the tent of the 
 Patriarch who laid his hands upon Col. Kane and blessed him  I wrote the blessing and presented the Col. with a copy of it  in my own handwriting    Next morning I took the parting hand of Col  Kane who left the Camp for the east also Bishop Whitney with   several of the brethren started for St Louis to buy goods for the  Camp of Israel    On Sunday the 13th we held meeting. Orson  Pratt discoursed upon Sceentific principles. He was followed by  President H. C. Kimball and then the Marshall of the city ^said^  that the City Council had passed certain acts among which were  that "there shall be no firing^shooting^ of firearms after sundown  and no timber cut within 20 miles of the place without the  direction of the council and that dogs be taken care of and  no more shot without the direction of the Marshall    Discourse of President Young    Afterwards President Young arose and said:    "I wish to say a few words upon principle  I desire the brethren and sisters to be taught in all things necessary  There is one thing I want you to realize and that is that God  angels and Saints—heaven and all of Gods creations are governed  by law. And I want the Camp of Israel to understand  that we must be. If Heaven was not controlled by law  what sort of a place would it be? I would not wish to be there  for where we rushed into heaven without law every man would  be in danger of loosing his rights and having them trampled  upon. But all celestial beings are governed by law and  order for the celestial law is a perfect order of things—a  perfect system of light law intelligence exaltation and glory  where every person's right's are sustained to the fullest extent 
 But we do not arrive at this at once. As an Apostle said we have precept  upon precept line upon line here a little and there a little until we  arrive at a fulness of knowledge and glory even that fulness which  reigns in the heavens    We must begin to be governed by law here  before we are prepared to receive the fulness that reigns in Heaven.  The whole law has not been given and you cannot abide the whole as  yet. If it had all been given we should all have been smashed  up and destroyed. A people must become acquainted thoroughly   with law before they can abide it; but the time has come when  we must have law and order in our midst    There has been some feelings of late in the  Camp because some unruly boys have been floged by the Marshall  for their wickedness; but if this Camp is not willing to let law  and order reign here and put a stop to such wickedness I wish  you to let me know it and I will go away from you for those  who wish to sustain crime and corruption let them return and  strike hands with the mob and carry out their principles and be  damned. But if you want to do right say so. This people  have been driven here for their desires to do righteousness and  this wickedness shall be put a stop to that has been manifest in  the camp by certain young people of late. Yes it will be  stopped if God comes out and smites it by judgement. The  Marshall did not whip them hard enough or they would not  have spit out their revenge but it would have been whipped  out of them. If I am drove to the necessity of whipping  a person in such a case they will not spit out revenge afterwards  for I will whip it out of them.    Shall we any longer sustain in our midst  men who will carry out the principles of John C. Bennett and  other corrupt scoundrils? No: I will sware by the Eternal  God of Heaven that such conduct shall be stopped and shall  not be permitted in this Camp for if they continue it I will 
 tell the Marshall what the law is and they shall be taken care off  in a manner that they will not whine and I will whip any man  who will sustain it. And I prophesy in the name of God  that such a man whether old or young shall be bowed down with  sorrow and mourning even more than this people have. Then  stop before you further go and not sport upon the brink of  sorrow and mourning. This people have the law of liberty  and the Gospel and the more the light and liberty and greater  the privileges the stricter the law. We are going into the  wilderness and shall we suffer such things? No: I sware by  the Eternal God such things shall not be while Brigham  lives.    Brother Kimball gave a good shot  when he said that no man would run into his waggon and  sware that he would shoot the Marshall if he came after him  except he was guilty of crime. No man is affraid except  he is guilty. No man need be affraid who does right  I defy the world to say that I have taken away ^any^ man's right^s^ but  after we have been driven into the wilderness we are still followed  by men who sware that they will steal what they get in our  midst. I sware tThey shall not have it in our midst    Some young Elders who never preached  a sermon in their lives are affaid that I shall have more   blessings than they or more wives or something or other but let  them go and preach the world over as I have in poverty and  distress with blood in my shoes and spent years and years  at it and left my wife and children who have also suffered much,  let them do as we have done and they will not be jealous of me  about blessings. If the Lord should give me a thousand  woman is it any man's business. No. Let such go and  spend as much time as I have and there will be many   clinging on to their skirts to be saved    The majority of the men of the Gentile 
 world will be damned and the women wished to be saved by going with good men  A woman that has the Spirit of God will go with a good man who has been faithful  and spent much time in saving mankind and who has the Priesthood. Such men if  they continue faithful will be saved in eternal glory and those who are with them    I am determined that my affections shall be with  God. I will not alow them to be placed on things that perish. When plagues  and disease get hold of our bodies we become loathsome and beautey fades away  but our affections should be placed upon things that are noble exalted lasting  and glorious. I love an exalted mind for it is eternal and cannot  fade. I want all my affections to be subject to God and glory and  eternal life. May God bless you: Amen.    Removal Of the Camp of Israel  September the 23rd    On this day we removed our encampment from the  prairie ridge to the table land on the bank of the Missouri River  This was a beautiful place for a city and we laid our city out in blocks  of 20 rods by 40 each lot 4 by 10. I had one block for my  company which consisted of nearly 40 families so I had to put two  families on a ^lot^ block. It was a very busy day and as we had no  yard we lost many of our cattle at night and I was hunting cattle  all the next day while most of my division drew poles and made a   fence to keep our cattle in.    Arrival of Daniel H. Wells  To the Camp of Israel  Sep. the 25    Squire Wells arrived in Camp to day and also Brother  Cutler. They were both direct from Nauvoo. I sat about one
