The Morning came And disappoint- ment came with it for I found on enquiry that  Father Carter had made up his mind not to be  Baptized this time As the other page will show He  firmly believed in the book of Mormon And in our  faith but could not get an evidence that it was  his duty to be baptized at this time I laboured  hard to take away his objections but his mind was  made up And I saw it could not be changed   ENDENTRY March 18, 1846    I went below found Father ready for Breakfast it is his birth Day EZRA CARTER sen is FIGURE 73 years old this day He informed  me that he had meditated much upon the subject of being baptized by me before I left but it was A vary cold day the snow over the ground And water frooze over And he could not get an evidence that it was his duty then And thought  it best to omit it.

I plucked some Pebbles from Mother  Carters grave to take to Phebe I then returned to the house bought some calf skin And Father Carter made Phebe  A Present of one which I took with me I took some of Father Carters Hair And the rest of the family except Mothers Carters And there was none of hers saved.

My Mother, cousin &amp; others took A seat in front of the Melchez idec Priesthood I occupied the uper stand  in company with Br Stratton. After singing Elder J A Stratton opened the meet- ing by Prayer. After which Elder Orson Hyde Arose And Addressed the Assembly from the following words. "what is man that thou  art mindful of him or the sun of man that thou visits him" My object says the speaker is to inquire what kind of A being man is. Man is As Eternal as God himself And is Just As much in Eternity now as he ever will be after Death, the period called time is ownly one portion of Eternity the same as the outer wall of A building incloses many rooms within or As the months Days, Hours minutes or seconds in a year while in any portion of them we are in the year still, while we exhist before the world was, or in the flesh or after  Death, it is all in eternity. The world opposes the principle of Revelation And does not wish man to obtain knowledge in that way, but what Earthly Father that feels interested in  the welfare of his children but what desires to teach his children &amp; reveal to them  the knowledge He possesses And would feel interested in there Advancement so with the Lord He gives gifts &amp; knowledge   ENDENTRY  men get the more refined are there feelings the knowledge is great &amp; so was his sympathy in giving his Son Jesus Christ to save man The world may oppose Revelation but God does not. we have recieved Revelation &amp; visions &amp; God hath shown us many things it is true these blessings have cost us great sacrafizes we have been oppressed all the day long And at last are now driven to the wilderness, but we will go &amp; not stay with the world, And when we go we remove the candle light from there midst And take it to the sons  of Nature who have not shed the blood of Prophets. I will leave my testimony with you, though it should be like A Harpoon. As respects the finishing of this house I will ask why have we laboured to complete it when we were not expecting to stay. there is two sides to every thing but Mormonism as to that there is but one side on earth the other is in  Heaven. If we moved forward &amp; finished this House we should be recieved  as A church with our dead but if not we  should be rejected with our dead. these things have inspired And stimulated us to Action in the finishing of it which through the blessing of God we have been enabled to accomplish And prepared it for dedication  In doing this we have ownly been saved as  it were by the skin of our teeth. The enemy Prophesyed we should not get the roof on but we have finished it. And on Thursday  night we met in this temple Arayed in our white robes &amp; dedicated it unto God And truly   ENDENTRY  to live And Die for the cause, you may wish to know what we have been doing in this house I will tell you. We have been anointing And ordaining Kings And Priest unto God. I have been Anointed A king &amp; Priest unto God. If any one wishes to kill me for it let them do it We have laboured hard to ordain kings &amp; Priest unto God to reign here on the earth but not now, but I will tell you when it will be. when the LORD JESUS CHRIST comes to reign and recieve his Crown And sit upon  his Throne, The Twelve Apostles will sit upon there Thrones &amp; Judge the Twelve tribes of Israel then is the time we expect to recieve our crown And inherit this earth. We look forward for A new Heaven &amp; earth but it will be the old concern made gloriously And renewed those who have been ordained unto this  office will be born at the resurrection in the royal linage. If this religion Gospel &amp; Priest- hood has not power to bind on earth and in heaven, it is good for nothing when A man has recieved this gospel Anointing And endow- ments let him go to the dust but He will  arise And take his place on his throne, then will the Nations serve And obey us. They are now Persecuting us And there Persecutions  are bringing gray hairs upon the Saints but  the Heads of the persecutors will be covered with blackness. Men may have been ordained from before the foundation of the world to have performed certain works, there are different stations in the next world And men will  be delt with  done in the body A man ought to be good   ENDENTRY  his duty And obtaines the Priesthood and honors it will have his reward. His exhaltation thrones &amp; dominions according to his faithful- ness. we like our Master have desended below all things so shall we arise above all things I have seen this by vision we shall be connected with the kingdom of Jesus Christ. To the vary place And station will A man arise in the resurrection to which He Has been sealed &amp; anointed on earth It is said that God will judge the world so will the saints. On earth Presidents &amp; Govornor do not Judge, but Judges apointed for the purpose so in Heaven we shall judge the world Holding the keys of the kingdom And will rise in judgment against our enemies who are heaping there persecutions upon our heads, so with the Ancient Twelve they will judge Israel for they  brought evil upon them I see the thousands of poor saints going out to the wilderness in there oppressions drove out by wicked men, such men I will not bless but testify against them they may kill me but I will speak my mind  that man that has the Priesthood and honors it, is God Himself as much as Moses was to the People we are sons of God And Saviors on Mt Zion. If ye are the sons of God ye shall have all things. He that over cometh shall  upon my throne &amp;c. The Lord owns all the Thrones &amp; will give us some. A man in the Priesthood has persons sealed to him  in his kingdom And is subject to him in the   ENDENTRY  continually being formed which adds to the  glory of God. Blessed is he who escapes the  second death, evry saint has A guardian  Angel with him so death cannot kill him  the Angels accompanied the Ancients so they  do us. The Angels of the waters &amp; there  was 4 on the cornors of the earth. when  the guardian Angel is called away we are  left to grapple with death. So with Jesus  He said my God, my God, why hast thou  forsaken me. In three days the Angel  returned rolled back the stone And raised  the Lord the Angels will not stay away forever  but will all come with Jesus Christ to raise  all the bodies every man in his own order this is the way the resurrection is brought  about. Jesus Christ was slain And buried yet  Arose, assended on high And was crowned  Lord of all so with the Prophets martered  in Carthage Jail they must come forth  And be crowned And sit upon there thrones  And Judge there persecutors If ye were  of the world the world would love its own  but because I have chosen you out of the  world there fore they hate you, but they must  be judged of you at last. Man is destined  to occupy A great place to increase in dominion  And Power And this is the secret spring of our  Action. I have A word of caution to all for  one I feel to resign my citizenship because  I cannot enjoy it. I would Advise all the saints  that they cast not another vote in this state  but resign all offices that they hold And all  our friends to do the same I do not say they  shall do it but advise them to. There is a   ENDENTRY  to come As our father And Mother or the  Nation that has bourn us has rejected us  And driven us out there is A National  calamity At the door. All things are not  known at once, this Temple was built  for A certain purpose that is gained will  we now sell, A vote was taken last fall not  to sell it, but A key that will not open a door And shut it again is not A good one  so if we have to sell the Temple to  remove the Poor the People that make  us do it must pay the bill &amp; meet the  consequences. All who are in favor of  selling this House if it meets with the council  of the Twelve manifest it by raising the right  hand it was A unanimous vote save one   by     And in speaking of the martydom of the  Smiths said they would rise in Judgment  against Against this Nation, the state of Illinois  Hancock ^Co^ And esspecially Carthage And the  murderers it contains, they are the most  suitable persons to rise in judgment against them, for they were martered by them yes the mob of Hancock Co had not yet  got through with Joseph Smith for He was  in the Presence of God and the Lamb in  company with Abram Isaac &amp; Jacob And was  our senator in the Court of Heaven And would  plead our cause And his own And knowing  the cause to be a just will do sumthing  that will have effect   ENDENTRY  the Temple &amp; were now recieved as A church  with our dead this is glory enough for building  the Temple And thousands of the Saints  have recieved there endowment in it And  the light will not go out many other remar- ks were made by Elder Woodruff when  the meeting &amp; dedication of the Temple  closed.
