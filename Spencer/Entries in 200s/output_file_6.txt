She stands greatly in need of the money for I left her destitute and she has receved nothing from me since I have been in England  Bro Pratt has said she might come to England if she saw propper.

It is a disgrace for the so called Republic  of North America ^to persecute^ the Church of J. C. of L. D. S. so unjustly and to the detriment of all humanity.

I offered my name as Bondsman among others, and was  accepted; and I think I placed it on the prophet's Bond; I distinctly recollect that his Bond called for more than double the maximum of the liability in case of conviction; this little incident confirmed it in my mind that  my name went on his Bond. They were then all dis- charged. But this was hardly effected before a mit- imus was served on Joseph and Hiram, and ^in^ it, the consta- ble was directed to confine them both in jail, this was alredy after dark. It is worthy of note, that they had not yet been brought before the justice on the charge of Treason, on which they were arrested, for examination, The illegality of their imprisonment was therefore urged by their Counsel, Esqr. Reed; but the Magistrate was Captain of the mutinous "Carthage Greys", as well as Justice of the Peace; so he had them forced to jail, notwithstanding the protests of their counsel, or the Governor's pledge, and the honor of the State that they should be protected from all illegality or violence.

To work for nothing and find himself; which he did faithfully and got nothing in return. He is very poor and broken. There are many things pertaining to this case, which I will not here mention; but your oft' repeated  declarations of your sense of justice and magnanimity, prompts me to believe, that you would acquiesce in, and even suggest something to the Presidency, which would induce them to render a little assistance to Br Mikesell's family. It reminds me of the Savour's Golden Rule.  I am prompted to take this step, because ENDENTRY I had the honor of being admitted into the jail with the prisoners that night; we were ushered into the lower north room, where there was no bed, cot, or chair that I can recall to mind, and here, if I recollect aright, we spent the night ^amusing ourselves^ as best we could.  The next morning the gentlemanly jailor called us to breakfast; and after partaking with him and family of a well prepared meal, he conducted us into an upper room, being the South East room, in which the prisoners, Taylor were  afterwards shot.  The party thus imprisoned were, the prophet, his brother Hiram, John Taylor, Dr. Willard Richards, Dan Jones, and a gentle- man friend from Texas, whose name I have forgotten, and (myself) John S. Fullmer.  It was on wednesday the 26th that the Governor redeemed his pledge to give "General Smith" a personal interview. This he did in company of a friend of his, when the prophet, like Paul, had the privilege of answering for himself. He rehearsed all the detailes of the causes which led to the present crisis; reminded his Excellency that "the question in dispute was a civil matter, and, to settle which, needed no resort to arms, and that he was at any time, and had always been, ready to answer to any charge in the premises that might be preferred against him, either as Mayor of the City, or as a private individual, in any Court of Justice, unintimidated by a mob or military array, and make all the satisfaction that the laws required, if any," andc. His Excellency stated that he "had not called out the force at hand ENDENTRY STOVER and CO., GENERAL MERCHANDISE, WOOL, HIDES, PELTS, WAGONS, CARRIAGES, andC.

Several hours after the interview mentioned, an officer arrived with a requision from the Magistrate then in Court, for the two prisoners, Hiram to forthwith appear before his Hon's court on the charge of Treason; their counsel plead, that as they had been imprisoned, the examination would be informal, and therefore they were not bound to appear. A posse soon afterwards appeared, headed by Lieutenant Worrel; opened a hollow Square with fixed bayonets, before the door of the prison, and demanded the prisoners, with a stern, defiant mien: Joseph hesitated; Hiram took him by the arm, saying, there is no getting round it, Joseph, we had better go.

On the next morning, the 27th it was ascertained that the Governor was preparing to leave for the city, as was already intimated, and that the trial had been postponed to suit the occasion; not fearing any danger at hand I sug- gested to the prophet, that unless he desired me to remain with them that day, I should like to also go to the city to witness the proceedings there, and again return to see the thing out in Hiram approved of my going, and in addition gave me a mission to assist Bro.

Woodruff  The foregoing in a copy of a  letter sent to England by Brother Levi Richards and have taken the opportunity of presenting the same to you that you might understand the arrangement made there.  Brother Philo Dibble's Sceneries Museum andc Beloved brethren Osrson Spencer.  Levi Richards to England affords me an opportunity of addressing you upon a subject the interest of which I know lies very near your hearts. Inasmuch as your name Bro Spencer was given ^1st^ to sanction and influence my feeble efforts in support of the noble cause of illustrating by painting the history of the Church. Others in common with yourself gave the helping hand, until the pencil of the Artist yielded to the inspiration of mind and the mighty passing events, the changing scences, the Vicissitudes of the Saints under the direct persecutions, and the travails of the Church, contending against the oppressions, errors, and superstitions of ungodly men.  Which will stand forever as a "way mark" of the rise and progress of the Church of the last days. As the importance of the work grew, upon me and I needed a more extensive patronage.  The 1st Presidency and the leading authorities of the Church were the willing supporters and the hearty co-operaters, in placing these high objects before the saints, scattered  throughout all the world and their magnitude.  The importance of uniting their Interests, with my labors in this Department of of the building up the Kingdom of God  To you also Bro Pratt I am indebted, for your whole soul engagedness as a living witness of the Truthfulness of my humble efforts to make a Hyram appear and speak to the Eye and heart of the thousands of Saints assembled at nauvoo, Council Bluffs, and may I not say, shall yet speak to the millions of this generation.  Permit me therefore dear brethren to lay before the the Saints in England, Ireland, Wales and wherever your infulence can be extended.  The nature, design, history, and importance of this work. I have already  nearly completed two scenes of a series, one illustrating Joseph addressing the Nauvoo Legion three Days prior to his imprisionment in Carthage Jail The other the murder of Joseph and Hyrum, while under arrest each scene comprising 128 feet of canvass.  The designs are by Bro Robert Campbell who is engaged in visiting places taking sketches, and making himself acquainted with all the essential matters and facts, as they may connect themselves with historical paintings The execution of the designs of the above sceneries, established the reputation of Bro Campbell among as for faithful portraiture  Bro Major of many years experience, has also devoted his labors in this work Many painters have made a sacrifice of time in responding to my calls upon their labors. Bro Campbell has many sketches of the sceneries mentioned in my "preface" These will appear as soon as means can be obtained to carry on the work in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake  Eschition Exhibition of the Sceneries are given from time to time, as wisdom shall dictate ENDENTRY Mount Pleasant, Jan 4th 1892  President W. Woodruff Salt Lake City  Dear Brother:  Your communication dated Dec: 31st in relation to my willingness to go on mission received. In reply will say:  The Lord has blessed me very much since I came to Zion and it would be ingratitude in me were I to refuse or excuse myself from going and spending my means and time for a season in His service.  I will obe on hand, nothing unforseen preventing me, at the time you designate Feb: 19th.  I am your Brother in the Gospel Rasmus Rasmuson 2nd  C. N. Lund. Bishop.  O.K. J. F. S.

I now want to go  home, but I can neither Borrow nor beg the means  at present as I know of, or at least I shall not try the Beging part.  Dear Br, I am not discouraged in the least we shall take the Kingdom yet, and enjoy it.  Tell Br. Hedlock his money came verry timely, and the  rest of it will be looked for with anxiety, as Brannan and another Br, have given their note to Winchester  and took the account, and all to keep Wm out of prison. the Prophet has stoped for the present for want of support.
