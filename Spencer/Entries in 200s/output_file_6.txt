 of the Methodist church and a priest. The timber is pine, fir, spruce, hem-lock and birch, also gooseberries,raspberries, whortleberries and uplandcranberries; bushes and timber grow out of the crevices of the rocks.There is a great amount and varietyof fish in the waters around these Islands, viz.: whale, black fish, shark,ground shark, pilot fish, horsemackerel, sturgeon, salmon, halibut, cod, pollock, tomcod, hake, haddock, mackerel, shad, bass, alewives, herring,pohagen, dolphin, whiting, frost fish,flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp, shad, cusk, blue backs, scollop, dogfish, muttonfish, lumpfish, squid, five fin-gers, monkfish, nursefish, sunfish,swordfish, thrasher, cat, scuppog, two-tog, eyefish, cunner, ling eels, lobsters, clams, mussels, winkels, porpoises, seals, &c.Sept. 6—The harbor was filled with a school of mackerel, which werecaught in great numbers by the people standing upon the wharf.While standing upon the farm ofEleazar Carver on the north island I counted fifty five islands, many of which were inhabited.Oct. 2—I left the island with Elder Hale; Cap. Ames took us to Thomas-town in a sloop.—3—We walked forty six miles to Bath.—4—We attended a baptist conven-tion, and preached to a large congrega-tion in the evening in Pierce's hall; the people listened attentively.—5—We walked thirty six miles to Portland.—6—Walked ten miles to father Carter's in Scarborough, where I found my wife and friends well.—9—I parted with Elder Hale, who returned to Kirtland. I contin-ued preaching through various towns on the main land until Nov. 2, when I again returned to Fox Islands, ac-companied by my wife.—15—I visited the Isle of Holt,twelve miles east, and preached to an attentive congregation, leaving themthe Book of Mormon, which they pro-mised to read. I returned on the16th.I continued my labors during thewinter of 1837-8, and nearly every person had attended my meetings, and taken sides for or against. Our enemies made attempts to break up our meetings.Jan. 15, 1838—A company of sailors belonging to the United Statesrevenue cutter, brought on shore aswivel and joined the mob, paradingnear the house where I was preaching,and discharged it several times, accom-panied with small arms, with the in-tention of breaking up the meeting. Some of the mob gathered around tosee what effect this would have. Iwarned them in the name of the Lord, and proclaimed the judgements ofGod that awaited the wicked, and shook my garments in the presence ofthe people, and told them I was clear of their blood; but they only heard my voice intermingled with the roar of cannon and musketry. Before Iclosed speaking, the sailors went back on board the revenue cutter. At the close of the meeting I baptized two,also one next day, and while baptiz-ing, the mob again commenced firingguns. The Baptists and Methodists got up the mob. Mr. Douglas, the Methodist Priest, when argumentfailed him, applied to all the magis-trates for warrants against me; theyrefused to grant them as he had nocause of complaint.Feb. 13—I crossed in the mailboat to Hampden, and ordained James Townsend. We walked togetherthrough deep snows, and visited and preached in the towns of Searsmont,Belfast, Northport, Frankfort, Hamp-den, and twice in the city hall in Ban-gor, to large assemblies, and returnedto Fox Islands via Casteem and theIsle of Holt. Arrived in Vinal HavenMarch 8. Elder Townsend returnedhome.March 22—I accompanied brother Stirrat, at low tide, on to a bar some forty rods from shore, to dig some clams. We were soon joined by Mrs. Woodruff and sister Stone, who had a curiosity to see how clams were dug. The ground for about twelve rodsnearer shore was several feet lowerthan the point we were on, but wewere so busily engaged we did not observe the flowing tide until we were surrounded by water, and having no boat, our only alternative was to wadeashore and carry the women, which 
 we safely accomplished amid the re-flection that time and tide waited for no man.April 4—Mr. Kent, the post mas-ter, showed me a letter containing two sheets of foolscap, signed by Warren Parrish and several of the Twelve, who had apostatized and been cut offfrom the Church. The communica-tion was full of slander and falsehoods against Joseph Smith and all thatstood by him. It was sent with the intention of breaking up the work upon these islands.11—I was visited by Elders Town-send and Milton Holmes, who atten-ded conferences with me upon bothislands, and bore their testimony tothe people, but the spirit of oppositionincreased to a great height. I was warned by the Spirit of the Lord to leave for a season and take a western mission. After visiting the Saints from house to house, and praying withand encouraging them, I left on the28th and went to the main land with Elders Townsend and Holmes. Mrs.Woodruff returned to her father's. We walked to Scarborough. I left May 7th, and walked to Bradford, where I left Elder Holmes, and pro-ceeded to Boston.May 11—I gave out an appoint-ment to preach at sister Vose's room, and I went to Cambridgeport to visitElder A. P. Rockwood, who had beenimprisoned in jail on pretence of debt, but in reality out of religious persecu-tion. The jailor locked me in until ten p.m.; but while it disappointed a congregation of people, it gave me ahappy visit with Elder Rockwood, conversing upon the Work of God. On my return to Boston the people were waiting to hear me; I spoke tothem a short time.(To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 296)HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-May 14—I left Boston, and walked some thirty miles to Holliston; staidat Deacon Haven's, and preached. I walked to Providence, R. I., fromthence took steamer to New York, and arrived on the 18th. Met and at-tended meetings with brother O. Pratt until the 27th, when I went up the North river to Newburgh, and preach-ed in several towns in New York andNew Jersey, and walked across the country to Farmington, Connecticut, and arrived at my father's June 11, 1838.I commenced preaching at my fa-ther's house. July 1st, I baptized six persons in Farmington river, inclu-ding my father, stepmother and myonly sister, Eunice; also cousin Seth Woodruff, aunt Anna Cossett and Dwight Webster, a Methodist class leader, who was boarding at my fa-ther's.When the Patriarch Joseph Smith, sen., gave me my blessing, he saidI should bring my father's householdinto the kingdom of God, which words were fulfilled this day.I confirmed those baptized, and organized this small Branch of the 
 Church, consisting of nine members, eight of whom were relatives. I or-dained Dwight Webster a Priest, andadministered the sacrament.July 3—I started for the State of Maine, and arrived at father Carter's, in Scarborough, on the 6th.—14—My wife was delivered of adaughter at her father's house; we named her Sarah Emma.22—I wrote to Thomas B. Marsh, an account of my labors upon Fox Islands and the eastern country.—30—I left Scarborough and re-turned to the islands. I preachedseveral times to large congregations in the Methodist meeting-house, in East Thomastown, and in the town hall in Camden, before crossing to the islands, where I arrived August 7th.August 9—I received a letter fromThomas B. Marsh, informing me of my appointment to fill the place, inthe Quorum of the Twelve, of one who had fallen, and I was requested to come to Far West as soon as possi-ble, to prepare for a mission to Eng-land in the sprlng. I immediatelyvisited all the Saints upon both islands,and earnestly exhorted them to selltheir property and prepare to accom-pany me to Missouri. Several im-mediately sold, but many were poor. Brother Nathaniel Thomas said hewould furnish means to help off all the poor Saints who desired to go, and for this purpose went with me tothe main land on the 13th, and I assisted him in purchasing two thou-sand dollars worth of horses, harness, wagons and tents for the company.He paid about $1,500 of the expenses himself, $1,000 of which went to fur-nish conveyance for the poor. Afterpurchasing the outfit for the company, I urged the importance of their start-ing as soon as possible, not later than the 1st of September.August 19—I left the town of Camden, where we had prepared our outfit, and returned to Scarborough to prepare my family for the journey, expecting to see the company in a few days; but here I remained in great suspense until October 1st, when Elder Townsend went to meet the company. They arrived in Scar-borough on the 3rd, with their wagon covers flying.The company stopped at the houseof sister Sarah B. Foss. We nailed down the covers and painted them,which made them waterproof.—4—We started upon our journey. My child was in the first stages of thewhooping-cough. Our company con-sisted of fifty-three persons; we hadten wagons, with a pair of horses toeach. We had before us, at this late period, a gloomy land journey of twothousand miles, from Maine to Mis-souri. We continued to travel through rain, mud, cold, frost and snow, until we arrived in Rochester, Sangamon county, Illinois, Dec. 19th, where Istopped and settled my family and company for the winter, being unable to proceed further. My wife had passed through a severe course of the brain fever while upon the journey; her sufferings had been very great.Her spirit had left her body twice toall human appearance, and only been called back through the prayer offaith and the power of God. Our child had also been very sick, and Ihad become so thoroughly chilled through my whole system, in crossingthe bleak prairies, that it was two months after I stopped, before I got sufficiently warmed to feel natural.Brother Thomas buried one child, and nearly all the company had been sick through exposure; some of them had stopped by the way.I spent the winter laboring with my hands for the support of my family.March 8, 1839—I attended a Con-ference at Springfield, Illinois.—13—I took my family and started for Quincy, where I arrived on the 16th. I dined with Emma Smith, atJudge Cleveland's. I then went onto the bank of the river near Quincy,and saw a great many of the Saints, old and young, lying in the mud and water, in a rain storm, without tentor covering, which suffering was caused by the unhallowed persecutionof the State of Missouri. The sightfilled my eyes with tears, while my heart was made glad at the cheerful-ness of the Saints in the midst of theiraffliction.—17 (Sunday)—I had an interview with President Brigham Young and John Taylor. We held a meeting with the Saints; $50 and a number 
 of teams were raised to bring out the remainder of the poor from Missouri. President Young counselled the Twelve to locate their families for the time being in Quincy. I returned toRochester for my effects. While at Springfield, I collected $70 for therelief of the Saints in Quincy, which I sent to them. I returned to Quincy on the 8th of April, where I left myfamily, and went to Far West withthe Twelve, and attended the Con-ference on the Temple block on the  26th, where I was ordained one of the Twelve Apostles, on the corner stone of the Temple, under the hands of the Twelve, Elder Brigham Youngbeing mouth. Elder Geo. A. Smith was also ordained at the same time. We returned to Quincy on the 2nd day of May.On the 3rd, in company with fiveof the Twelve, I went to Judge Cleve-land's, and had a happy interview with President Joseph Smith, whohad just escaped out of the hands of his persecutors in Missouri; it wasthe first time I had seen him for morethan two years, and it was a happymeeting. I attended the Conferenceand meetings with the Saints in Quin-cy, until the 15th, when I moved myfamily to Montrose, and occupied aroom in the barracks with PresidentYoung and family. I spent my time in attending the meetings, Councilsand Conferences. I wrote in my journal the teachings, sayings and prophecies of Joseph from time to time, as I had opportunity.(To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 312.)HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-July 22—I was with President Joseph Smith and his Council and theTwelve; it was a day of God's powerwith the Prophet. He healed many who were sick nigh unto death, among whom were Elijah Fordham andJoseph B. Nobles; even the wicked rabble followed to see the sick healed. As Joseph was about to cross theriver, a man came to him and asked him if he would go about three miles and heal two of his small children, who were twins, about three months old, and were sick nigh unto death. He was a man of the world, he hadnever heard a sermon preached by a Latter-day Saint. Joseph said he could not go, but he would send a man. After hesitating a moment, heturned to me and said, "You go with this man and heal his children," atthe same time giving me a red silk handkerchief, and said, "After you lay hands upon them, wipe their faces with it, and they shall be healed; and as long as you will keep that handker-chief, it shall ever remain as a league between you and me." I went and did as I was commanded, and the children were healed.On the 25th, I was attacked withchills and fever. I had a chill every other day, and was very sick.August 8—I laid my hands uponmy wife and children, blessed them,committed them into the hands of God, and started upon my English mission, leaving my family sick, and with not more than four days' pro-visions. Brother Brigham Young rowed me across the Mississippi in a boat; I was sick and feeble. When 
 I landed, I laid down upon the bankof the river on a side of sole leather. The Prophet Joseph came along and looked at me, and said, "You arestarting on your mission." I saidyes, but I look like a poor instrumentfor a missionary; I look more fit fora hospital or dissecting room than amission. He replied, "What do you say that for? Go ahead in the name of the Lord, and you shall be healed and blessed on your mission." I thanked him. A brother came alongwith a wagon, and carried me a few miles on my road. I started without purse or scrip, and passed by ParleyP. Pratt, who was hewing logs for a house; he was bare-footed, bare-headed, without coat or vest on. He said, "I have no money, but I havean empty purse; I will give you that." I went a few rods, and found Elder H. C. Kimball building a log cabin. He said, "I have one dollar, I will give you that to put in your purse."He blessed me, and I went my way, accompanied by Elder John Taylor. I had a shake of the ague every other day, and lay on the bottom of thewagon while I travelled.We staid with Samuel H. and DonCarlos Smith at Macomb, and held a meeting with the Saints, who contri-buted $9 to our necessities, and GeorgeMiller gave us a horse. Father Colt-rin was going east; he took us into his wagon to help us along. We spent five days in Springfield, whereElder Taylor printed fifteen hundred copies of a pamphlet upon the Mis-souri persecution. We sold our horse, and left on the 21st, and continued our journey. We spent the night ofthe 24th with Dr. Modisett, of Terre-haute.On the 28th, while travelling, Elder Taylor fell to the ground as though hehad been knocked down. We admini-stered to him, and he revived. On the following day he fell again, andfainted several times; it seemed asthough the destroyer would take hislife. We travelled with him four daysafter he was taken sick. His sicknessproved to be bilious fever. We stop-ped with him two days at a German tavern, in Germantown, Wayne county,Indiana, with a kind family withwhom he was acquainted. Father Coltrin would stay no longer. I pro-posed to remain with Brother Taylor,but as I was sick with fever and ague, and not able to take care of myself, brother Taylor advised me to continuemy journey with Father Coltrin, say-ing, "It is easier to take care of onesick man than two." I committedhim into the hands of God, and thefamily promised to do all in their power to make him comfortable. I parted from him with a heavy heart.Sept. 2—I continued my journey with Father Coltrin to Cleveland,Ohio. I there took steamer on the 10th for Buffalo; had a severe gale,and did not reach Buffalo until the 12th. I travelled to Albany on a canal boat; had the ague daily, was very sick; had no companions exceptsectarian priests, who were daily ly-ing about the "Mormons." I took stage at Albany for Farmington, Con-necticut, on the night of the 19th, and rode all night and the following day; suffered severely with fever and ague.I arrived at my father's house in Farmington on the 21st, quite sick.I found my father and family well.On the 27th Sept., 1839, my mater-nal grandmother, Anna Thompson,died, aged 84; I was too sick to attend her funeral. It is a singular incidentthat my grandfather, Lot Thompson,and Anna Thompson his wife, Samuel Thompson and Mercy Thompson, allof one family, died in their 84th year.On the 4th October, Adner Hart,brother to my step-mother, died, aged 43. He requested me to preach his funeral sermon. I had been sick atmy father's house, with the ague, for fifteen days, attended with a severe cough, and the hour appointed for the funeral was the time for my ague, yet I attended the funeral and preached, and I had no more ague for many days. I left on the 7th, and visited New York, Long Island, and NewJersey, in very poor health.Nov. 1—I assisted Elders Clark, Wright and Mulliner, to set sail for England. Elder John Taylor had re-covered from his sickness, and arrivedin New York on the 13th December.Dec. 19—In company with Elders John Taylor and Theodore Turley, I went on board the packet-ship Oxford,and sailed for Liverpool, where I 
 landed January 11, 1840, in goodhealth and spirits. When I left my father, he gave me some money to assist in paying my passage; also gaveme five dollars, which he requestedme to keep until I arrived in Liver-pool, saying, I would there need it. This I found to be true after landing;that money was all we had to pay our expenses to Preston, and we had two-pence left.We arrived in Preston on the 13th. Had a happy interview with brother Willard Richards; held a Council, and agreed that Elder Taylor go to Liverpool, Turley to Birmingham, andI to Staffordshire Potteries.Jan. 18—I arrived in Manchester; met Elder William Clayton, who pre-sided over that Branch, numbering 164 members. I was immediatelycalled upon to visit a woman possessed with the devil. She was raging and foaming, and had to be held by four men. The more we rebuked the devil, the worse she raged. We con-tinued to pray and administer, until we cast the devil out. She arose and gave thanks to the Lord. The devilthen entered into a young child, andwe cast him out. I preached severaltimes, and laid hands on twenty-eight persons. I went to Burslem on the21st, and met with Elder Alfred Cordon, President of the BurslemBranch, which numbered 66. I com-menced preaching in the StaffordshirePotteries. Elder Turley left for Bir-mingham on the 29th. I remained in the Potteries some forty days, preach-ing, baptizing and confirming, andblessing children.(To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 328.)HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-March 1—As I met in the evening with a large assembly in Hanley, the Lord revealed unto me that it would be the last meeting that I would hold with the Saints in the Potteries for many days. I told the people it wasthe last meeting I should hold withthem for a season; it created much excitement. I had appointments out for a week, which I got brother Cor-don to fill. I went before the Lord inprayer, and asked him where I should go; the Spirit said, "Go to the south." According to the directions of the Spirit, on the 3rd I went toHerefordshire, and called upon John Benbow, at Castlefroom. I found a people prepared for the Gospel. Ipreached twice at his house. On the6th, I baptized six persons, includingJohn Benbow and wife. I here founda society called "United Brethren," numbering about six hundred mem-bers, and about fifty preachers; Tho-mas Kington was the presiding elder. They came from all quarters to hear me preach, and believed my testimony,and I preached and baptized daily. The ministers of the Church of Eng-land sent three church clerks to seewhat I was doing, and I baptized them.One constable came to arrest me forpreaching, and I baptized him. In about thirty days I baptized 160, forty-eight of whom were preachers of the "United Brethren," including theirpresiding elder, Thomas Kington.I established forty-two preaching places, licensed according to law.On the 9th April, I had an appoint-ment at Haw Cross. As I was goinginto the meeting, letters were put into my hands from Elder Brigham Young and others, informing me of his arri-val with five of the Twelve, and re-questing me to come to Preston, andattend a General Conference. A vast assembly had gathered to attend my meeting; the house, yard and streetwere crowded; a mob had also gather-ed. I preached to the people; five came forward to be baptized. The mob surrounded the pool, armed withstones. I dismissed the meeting and went away, but the congregation and mob remained on the ground till mid-night; and as there was no prospect of their dispersing, and the candidateswere anxious to be baptized, I went down into the water and baptized five, in the midst of a shower of stones. The water was all in a foam for a rod around me. None that I baptized were hit, and I was only hit twice, once on my hip and once on my head; the blow on my head raised a large bump, which went away while I was confirming. Subsequently I baptizedmany of the mob.I left next morning for Preston, and attended the Conference with theTwelve, and returned to Hereford-shire, accompanied by Elder BrighamYoung, on the 22nd April, and was soon joined by Elder Willard Rich-ards. Elder Young remained twenty- 
 seven days, preaching, baptizing, con-firming and counselling. Numbers were added daily to the Church. He then returned to Manchester.I spent about seven months inHerefordshire, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. We baptized over eighteen hundred, including all of the "United Brethren" save one. Webaptized over two hundred preachersof various denominations in that part of the vineyard. A synod of churchministers became so alarmed for their flocks in that part of the vineyard, they petitioned Parliament to adopt measures to stop our preaching. Theyreceived for an answer, that if theywere as well acquainted with the Bible as their hunting grounds, andwere as much interested in the welfareof the souls of men, as the chasing of the stags and foxes, they would not lose so many of their congregations.Aug. 18—I visited London in com-pany with Elders H. C. Kimball andG. A. Smith. I labored with them in establishing a church, spending over five months in that populous city.We visited nearly every part of the city, and all the notable places that we could have access to.I attended all the General Confe-rences in England, and set sail with my brethren of the Twelve on the shipRochester, April 20, 1841. Arrived in New York May 20th(To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 344.)HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-I went to Scarborough, Maine, aftermy wife, and also my son, Wilford,who was born March 22, 1840. My daughter, Sarah Emma, had died July 17, 1840.I returned to New York, and started for Nauvoo, via the Lakes; was wrecked on Lake Michigan in the steamer Chesapeake, but arrived in Nauvoo in safety Oct. 6, 1841, when I had the happy privilege of meeting with the Prophets Joseph and Hyrum, and my brethren of the Twelve.I bought a log house of brother Tracy, on lot No. 1, block 106, on Hotchkiss and Durfee Streets. Presi-dent Joseph Smith afterwards gave me the lot.I spent the winter of 1841-2 attend-ing meetings, councils, and laboringwith my hands. I attended the Nau-voo House provision store until the 3rd Feb., 1842, when I took chargeof the business department of theprinting-office.On the 5th of March, my daughter, Phebe Amelia, was born.Sep. 24—The printing-office took fire in the upper story, in the midst of a large amount of paper, and was with difficulty extinguished.I remained in Nauvoo, attending council meeting and the business of the printing-office, until the 7th of July 1843, when I started on a mission with Elders Brigham Young and Geo. A. Smith, to the Eastern States, to collect funds fo the Temple and Nau-voo House. I gave bonds in the sum of two thousand dollars for the faith-ful return of all monies received.On my return home in the fall, Ipurchased a supply of paper and other materials sufficient for the print-ing-office for more than a year, andarrived in Nauvoo on the 4th of Nov.I spent the winter of 1843-4 in Nauvoo, received my endowments 
 with the Twelve, and remained in the printing-office until the 20th of Janu-ary 1844, when I closed the business, and left it well supplied with materialsin the hands of Elder John Taylor.I built a two story brick house upon my lot.In the spring of 1844, I was ap-pointed a mission to go through theEastern States with the Quorum of the Twelve, and on the 9th of May 1844, I took the last parting hand with President Joseph Smith, in hisown house, in company with J. M. Grant. He blessed me, and bid meGod speed. I left Nauvoo in companywith Elders G. A. Smith, J. M. Grantand Ezra Thayer. We travelled through Illinois, Indiana and Michi-gan, and preached and held Confe-rences.June 17—I parted with Elder G. A. Smith in Franklin, Michigan, andwent to Boston via the Lakes and Albany; met with the Twelve in Boston on the 27th of June. I at-tended Conferences and meetings withthe Twelve, and visited Maine. I was in Portland, ready to step onboard of a steamer for Fox Islands, when I saw an account of the martyr-dom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith in Carthage jail; the Spirit bore record tome it was true. I immediately return-ed to Boston, met in Council with the Twelve, returned with them to Nauvoo, where we arrived on the 6th of August. I attended the Special Conference of the Authorities of the Church, when the thousands who assembled on theoccasion, voted unanimously to sus-tain the Quorum of the Twelve Apos-tles as the Presidency and leaders ofthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.I have ever been impressed, since my first acquaintance with the Church and kingdom of God upon the earth, with the importance of keeping a journal and record of the dealings ofGod with this people, and our official acts in the ministry, and under this view I have written sketches of mostof the sermons and teachings which I have heard from the mouth of Joseph Smith the Prophet, and many of the teachings of the Twelve Apostles and others. Believing this course to be beneficial, I would recommend theElders of Israel to do likewise, thatwhat is recorded on earth may be re-corded in heaven.CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.(Written at Great Salt Lake City, Feb. 1858.)Varied and diverse are the lives and fortunes of men; while the paths of some are strewn with flowers and ease from the cradle to the grave, with naught to disturb their peace, others are marked victims of variedmisfortunes, accidents and dangers. The last-named class is the one in whose ranks I have stood through myinfancy, childhood, youth and man-hood, up to the present time, so much so, that it has seemed as though someinvisible power or fate was watchingmy footsteps, in order to find someopportunity to take my life from theearth. I can only attribute the con-tinuation of my life to the presenttime to a merciful God, whose hand has been stretched out, and rescuedme from death in the midst of the many dangers and hairbreadth escapes I have passed through, some of which I will here mention.When three years of age, I fell intoa caldron of boiling water, was in-stantly caught out, but was so badly scalded, that it was nine months be-fore I was considered out of danger.At five years of age, I fell from the great beam of a barn, striking my face upon the floor, which came near breaking my neck.Three months afterwards, I broke one of my arms, by falling downstairs. I soon after broke my otherarm, by falling out of a high stoop upon a pile of timber.When six years of age, I came nearbeing killed by a surly bull. My father and I were feeding pumpkinsto the cattle, a surly bull drove my cow away from the one she was eating. I took the pumpkin he had left, upon which he pitched at me. My father told me to throw down the pumpkinand run. I ran down a steep hill, and took the pumpkin with me, being determined that the cow should haveher rights. The bull pursued. As he was about to overtake me, I step-ped into a post hole and fell; the bull leaped over me, after the pumpkin, and tore it to pieces with his horns, 
 and would have served me in the same way, had I not fallen.During the same year, I went intomy father's saw mill, with several others. I got upon the head-block totake a ride, while the carriage wasrunning back, not anticipating any danger; my leg was caught between the head-block and the fender-post, and broke both bones of my leg belowthe knee. I was taken to the house, and lay nine hours before my bones were set, suffering severe pain; but being young, my bones soon knit together, and I was upon my feet again. During my confinement by this lameness, my brother Thompsonwas also confined in the same roomwith the typhus fever.When seven years of age, I was riding on the top of a load of hay, which my uncle, Ozan Woodruff, wasdriving to the barn; he turned the load over upon me; I was nearlysuffocated for the want of air, before the hay was removed.At eight years old, I was riding ina one-horse wagon with several others,the horse took fright, ran down asteep hill, and turned the wagon overupon us; but again, while in the midst of danger, my life was preserved;none of us were seriously injured.When nine years old, I climbed into an elm tree to obtain bark. I steppedupon a dry limb, which broke, and I fell about fifteen feet upon my back, which beat the breath out of my body. A cousin ran and told my parents I was dead. Before they arrived at the spot, I came to my senses, and metthem.When twelve years of age, I was drowned in Farmington river, andsunk in 30 feet of water, and after carrying one person to the bottom with me, I was miraculously saved by a young man named Bacon diving tothe bottom, and carrying with him a large stone, to hold him down until heobtained my body, not expecting to save me alive. I suffered much in being restored to life.(To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 360.)HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.(Written at Great Salt Lake City, Feb. 1858.)At thirteen years of age, while passing through Farmington meadows,in the depth of winter, the roads weredrifted with snow; and in an ex-ceedingly blustering day, I became so chilled and overcome with cold, thatI could not travel. I crawled intothe hollow of a large apple tree. Aman in the distance seeing me go in, hastened to my rescue, realizing mydanger more fully than I did. Whenhe arrived at the spot, I had fallenasleep, and was nearly insensible; hehad much difficulty in arousing me toa sense of my situation. He procuredmeans to carry me to my father'shouse, and through a kind Providence,my life was again preserved.At fourteen years of age, I split my left instep open with an ax, which went nearly through my foot; it was nine months getting well.At fifteen years of age, I was bittenin my left hand by a mad dog in thelast stage of hydrophobia. He dented my hand with his teeth, but did notdraw blood, and I was again pre-served, through the mercies of God, from an awful death.At the age of seventeen, I was riding a very ill-tempered horse that I was not acquainted with; and while going down a very steep rocky hill, the horse taking advantage of the ground, suddenly leaped from the road, andran down the steep, amid the rocks, at full speed, and commenced kicking up, and attempted to throw me overhis head upon the rocks; but I lodged upon the top of his head, graspedhold of each ear as with a death grip, expecting every moment to be dashed to pieces against the rocks. While inthis position, sitting astride of his neck, with no bridle to guide him buthis ears, he plunged down the hill under full speed, until he ran againsta rock, and was dashed to the ground. 
 I went over both his head and the rocks, about one rod, and struck the ground square on my feet, being theonly thing visible that saved my life; for, had I struck upon any other part of my body, it must have killed meinstantly; as it was, my bones crushedfrom under me as though they were reeds. It broke my left leg in two places, and put out both my ankles ina shocking manner, and the horse came near rolling over me in his strug-gles to get up. My uncle, Titus Woodruff, saw me fall, got assistance, and carried me to his house. I layfrom 2 p.m. till 10, without medical aid; then my father arrived, bringing Dr. Swift, of Farmington, with him,who set my bones, boxed up my limbs, and carried me in his carriage eight miles that night to my father's. My sufferings were very great. I had good attention, however, and in eightweeks I was out-doors upon my crutches.In 1827, while attempting to clear the ice out of a water-wheel, standingupon the wheel with one arm around the shaft, a man hoisted the gate, andlet a full head of water upon it. As soon as the water struck the wheel it started, my feet slipped into the wheel, but I immediately plunged head foremost over the rim into about three feet of water, and my weightdrew my legs out of the wheel, or I should have been drawn under a shaft and crushed to death.In 1831, while having charge of theflouring mill in Collinsville, Connecti-cut, I was standing inside of a breast wheel, 20 feet in diameter, upon one of the arms near the top, clearing out the ice, when a full head of water was let on to it. The wheel immediatelystarted; but I dropped my ax andleaped through it to the bottom, bythe shaft and arms, about twenty feet;as I struck the bottom of the wheel, I was rolled out against a ragged stone wall, with only about two feet clear-ance between it and the wheel. The wheel caught me and rolled me outinto the water below, where I foundmyself without any bones broken, butwith some bruises and much fright.During the winter of 1831, while in New Hartford, Ct., I passed througha severe course of lung fever.In 1833, the day I was baptized, one of my horses, newly sharp shod, kicked my hat off my head, and hadhe struck two inches lower, wouldprobably have killed me instantly. Inten minutes afterwards, while drivingthe same team down a hill, on a sleigh without any box, the bottom boards slipped forward under the roller and caught the ground, turned endwise, and fell on the horses' backs, throw-ing me between the horses; they ranto the bottom of the hill, dragging me with the lines, head foremost, withthe sleigh on top of me, about twenty rods over a smooth snow path; I es-caped unharmed, however, in themidst of both dangers.In 1834, while travelling in Zion's Camp in Missouri, a rifle was acci-dentally discharged, and the ball passed through three tents, with abouttwelve men in each, and lodged in a wagon axle-tree, while a man wasstanding behind it, and injured no one. It passed within a few inchesof my breast, and many others es-caped as narrowly as myself.A few months afterwards a musket, heavily loaded with buckshot, was accidentally snapped within a few feet of me, with the muzzle pointed at my breast; it had a good flint and was well primed, but it missed fire, and my life was again preserved.In April 1839, in Rochester, Illinois, I was riding upon the running gears of a wagon without a box, sitting uponthe forward axle-tree, when the bolt, fastening the coupling pole, came out, which left the hind wheels; and my weight on the forward bolster and tongue, turned the coupling pole overon to the horses, turning the stakes upside down, and shut me up fast be-tween the bolster and tongue, but in such a manner that my head and shoulders dragged on the ground; my horses took fright, and ran out into an open prairie, and dragged mein this position for about half a mile. I managed to guide them with myleft hand, so as to run them into a corner of a high worm fence, where we landed in a pile together. I was considerably bruised, but escaped without any broken bones.July 23, 1842—President Joseph Smith sent me from Nauvoo to St. 
 Louis to procure a stock of paper. Iwent down upon a steamboat; wassix days on the way, during whichtime I was severely attacked with bilious fever. The day I made mypurchase, the fever was so high I was scarcely sensible of what I was doing. As soon as I made my purchase and got my freight on board, I took my berth, and lay there until I arrived at Nauvoo on the 10th of August. Iwas confined to my bed forty days, and passed through the most severefit of sickness I ever endured; my life was despaired of by many of myfriends. I was administered to by President Smith and the Twelve; mylife was preserved by the power of God. I took a relapse twice after I began to recover; once while in Coun-cil with the Presidency and Twelve, my strength left me, my breath stop-ped, and I felt as though I was struck with death.Sept. 12, 1843—At five o'clock p.m., I left Boston on the expresstrain for Portland. While passingthrough Chesterwoods, six miles southof Kennebunk, after dark, and while going at full speed, we struck one ofthe rails which some persons hadraised by rolling a log under it, and landed in a pile; three cars werefilled with passengers, and their liveswere saved by having a long train offreight between the passenger cars andthe engine; all of them were mashedto pieces; the engineer was killed,some of the passengers had bones broken; I escaped unhurt.(To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 376.)HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.(Written at Great Salt Lake City, Feb. 1858.)On the 5th of October, 1846, whilewith the camp of Israel building up winter Quarters, on the west side of the Missouri river, (then Indian country) I passed through one of themost painful and serious misfortunesof my life. I took my axe and wenttwo and a half miles on to the bluffs tocut some shingle timber to cover my cabin; I was accompanied by two men. While the third tree was falling, which was an oak, over two feet in diameter,I stepped behind it some ten feet, andalso to one side the same distance, where I thought I would be entirely out of danger; but when the tree fell,there being a crook in the body of it,which struck a knoll on the ground, the whole body shot endways back of the stump and bounded, and the buttof the tree struck me on the breastand knocked me several feet into theair against a standing oak, and the falling tree followed me in its boundand caught me against the standingtree, and I came down between them;before reaching the earth, however, I was liberated from them, and struck the ground upon my feet in a badlybruised condition. My left thigh, the whole length of it, and my hip andleft arm were much bruised; my breast bone and three ribs on my left side were broken; my lungs, vitals and left side were also bruised in a shocking manner. After the accidentI sat upon a log until Mr. JohnGarrison went a quarter of a mile toget my horse. Notwithstanding I was so badly hurt, I mounted my horse, and rode two and a half miles over a very rough road, dismounting twice in consequence of miry places, my breastand vitals were so badly torn to pieces, that at each step of the horse the painwent through me like an arrow. I con-tinued on horseback until I arrived at Turkey creek, on the north side of Winter Quarters. I then becameexhausted, and was taken off my horse 
 and carried to my wagon in a chair. I was met in the street by Presidents Brigham Young, H. C. Kimball andW. Richards and others, who assistedin carrying me to my family. Beforelaying me upon my bed, the Presidency laid hands upon me, rebuked my suffering and distress in the name of the Lord, and said I should live and not die. I wasthen laid upon my bed in my wagon,and as the Apostles prophesied uponmy head, so it came to pass. I employed no physician on this occasion, but was administered to by the Elders of Israel and nursed by my wife. I lay upon my bed unable to move untilmy breast bone began to knit together, which commenced on the ninth day. I began to walk about in twenty days; in thirty days from the time I was hurtI again commenced to do hard labor.July 5th, 1848—While on a missionto the Eastern States, I drove mycarriage, containing myself and family into the dooryard of brother JamesWilliams in Iowa, to camp for thenight. I tied my mules to a large oak tree several rods from the carriage. As we were about to lay down in thecarriage for the night, I was stronglyimpressed to go and move my mulesfrom the oak tree, and also to movemy carriage. I followed the dictatesof the spirit, and removed my mules toa small hickory grove, also moved mycarriage several rods, and retired to rest. In a short time a heavy rainstorm came on, which broke the tree near the ground, and laid it prostrate where my carriage had stood. As it was, the top struck the hind end of the carriage; the tree was two feet in diameter. Thus, by obeying the whisperings of the Spirit, myself and family werepreserved.On the 21st day of April, 1856, while assisting to remove an ox thathad died from poison and had beenskinned, I inoculated my arm withpoison and mortification ensued. Thepoison worked through my system for seven days before it showed itself out-wardly. On the 28th my arm began to swell, was in great pain and showedsigns of mortification. I showed it to President Young, who advised me to cleanse my stomach immediately, and put on onion poultices, and anythingthat would draw the poison from my system into my arm, which counsel I immediately put in execution. The 29th was another trying day to mylife; the poison had so thoroughly penetrated my whole system, that my strength left me; I could not stand, I was led to my bed, my bowels and stomach ceased to act, my speech was like that of a drunken man. PresidentYoung called, in company with Dr. Sprague, and laid hands upon me, andrebuked the disease and the power ofthe destroyer which had seized my body, and promised me in the name ofthe Lord, that I should not die but live to finish my work which was appointedme upon the earth. I soon began to re-cover. The poison and mortification left my system and centered in my arm, and was drawn from my arm through the aidof charcoal poultices, moistened with a strong decoction of wormwood, ragweed and wild sage; the dead fleshwas removed from my arm withinstruments and lunar caustic, and ina few days I was well again.I have occupied considerable space in referring to those peculiar circum-stances which have attended me during life, and to sum the matter upit stands thus:—I have broken both legs—one in two places—both arms, my breast bone and three ribs, and had both ankles dislocated. I have been drowned, frozen, scalded and bitby a mad dog—have been in two water wheels under full head of water—have passed through several severe fits of sickness, and encountered poison in its worst forms—have landed in a pile of railroad ruins—have barely beenmissed by the passing bullets, andhave passed through a score of other hair-breadth escapes.It has appeared miraculous to me, that with all the injuries and brokenbones which I have had, I have not alame limb, but have been enabled toendure the hardest labor, exposures and journeys—have often walked forty, fifty, and on one occasion, sixty milesin a day. The protection and mercy of God has been over me, and my lifethus far has been preserved; for which blessings I feel to render the gratitudeof my heart to my Heavenly Father, praying that the remainder of my daysmay be spent in His service and in the building up of his kingdom.(To be continued.)

Thesecond Mate steped forward to the bow ofthe ship & ordered one of the hands todo sumthing on the bowsprit He refused uponthe principle that it was dangerous & a riskof his life the Mate said He would not ask aman to do a thing that he was not willing todo himself And stept forward to do it whileat the same moment they shiped A seawhich instantly washed him overboardthe seas were running high & the ship going8 not an hour the cry of second mateoverboard was instantly rung through theship ropes was flung to him but he cold notget them the Bouy was next flung to himHe swam hard to get to it but He could notget him it as the seas were runing so highit floated to the leeward of him. The captthen gave orders to wear the ship which wasdone as spedily as possible still it took severalminutes the Life boat was let down at thesame time maned by Harry the Boatswain 
 And four others hands notwithstanding theHigh seas they managed the boat well, theMate continued to swim for 15 or 20 minutesamid the raging billows even untill the lifeboat was within A few rods of him whenHe instantly sunk to rise no more theyremained on or near the spot whare hewas last seen both with the life boat & shipfor near an hour but nothing more was seenof him the life boat then came along sideAnd it was with great difficulty they goton board of the ship as they came nearbeing swamped several times but after evryexhertion being made they were obliged totrim there sails to the wind & continue therecourse & leave there mate in his watery gravespeaking loudly that while in life we are in themidst of death the captain & crew seemedmuch affected by the incident. His Namewas William Drummond An American, nativeof Flushing Long Island New York hisParents live near the city of New Yorkwas A single man had been in the EastIndia trade with this same Captain WilliamHowland this was his first trip in the Liverpool trade And was now on his return homwas A stirring Ambitious young man wasremarking last night what pleasure He wouldhave in taking tea with his Mother on his arivalin New York but his hopes are suddenlyblasted And A Mother will be disappointedHarry the Boatswain was Appointed to take

I spent the day mostly Arangingmy BooksFebruary 6, 1846 ~ Friday6th A Steemer hove in sight this morning on herway to Liverpool remained in sight about onehour, we still have A head wind I was sea sickat night we run about 7 nots per hour. we arein constant danger of being destroyed by firethrough the carlessness of the passengers withthere pipes And candles about there strawbeds & crates of crockery filled with straw 
 February 7, 1846 ~ Saturday7th Saturday I was sea sick this morning And vomited some we have still head wind And make but slow progress which is vary discourageing to us considering our situation as our business requires haste but we would console ourselves the best we could each one would tell what he would do when he got on shore we first would take a dish of oysters together I would take A keg of oysters & some clams And A fresh codfish to My father & Mother from New Haven (I must see that I do it) each one was to take there friends sumthing so we would occasionally feed upon these reflections. One man A steerage passenger got several buckets of water flung on to him & the ropes end for his filthiness about the floor. The man thate broke his choler bone is getting betterFebruary 8, 1846 ~ Sunday8th Sunday I had some plesant dreams last night in visiting my friends when I awoke the first sound I heard was from the steward saying After so long a time the wind has changed in our favor And that we were running on our course 11 1/2 nots an hour before a good fare breeze this was Joyful news to us it cheered up our spirits As we had been warring Against Head winds ever since we had left Liverpool over 17 day during which time we had got ownly about 1200 miles And we have got nearly 3000 miles yet to gowe dressed ourselves & went on deck And it was truly a glorious view All the sails were well filled & we were plunging through the ocean like the horse rushing to battle, the log was 
 flung at 12 oclok And it was found the ship was running 13 not an hour on our course As we have had bad beginning I hope we may have good ending. A squall struck us at 4 oclok the Log was flung All the line run from the reel befor the sand was out it was supposed to be running 14 not an hour which is as fast as the ship could sail this is the first day we have had a fair wind A whole day sinc we left LiverpoolFebruary 9, 1846 ~ Monday9th We have had an Easterly wind through the night which has caused the ship to roll in the trough of the sea untill Boxes trunks cans &c were tumbling through the ship & we could scarcely keep his our berths we are going 10 not an hour this morning on our course we have made 400 miles since the wind changed we are having a rough day in consequence of the rocking of the shipFebruary 10, 1846 ~ Tuesday10th A fair wind but light breeze we run 5 nots in the evening A strong breeze fair wind smooth sea run 13 nots we had A good short cake & Apple Dumplings for dinner All sail is set I never saw a ship carry so much sail in strong winds And gales as the AshburtonFebruary 11, 1846 ~ Wednesday11th We have this morning A strong South East wind with fore & main top gallant sails set we run 13 nots an hour on the course this is truly incourageing And things are turning in our favor they have so much canvass 
 up it tries the whole strength of the ship most ships with the same wind would be under closs reef top sails I spent the day in writing. A gale struck us at 4 oclok though the wind was fare the ship was immediately put under closs reef top sail & they let her drive on her course some of the time strong gusts would strike her And make her tremble, it was the roughest night we have had on the voyage but the Byrometer to day speaks of a still greater storm ahead seas are vary highFebruary 12, 1846 ~ Thursday12th Seas High & rough this morning the wind still continues vary strong from the South East we are still under reef top sails though they make A little sail this morning we all felt some unwell it is supposed we shall reach the Bank of Newfoundland this evening at 6 ocl[ock] the capt had the lead cast for soundings we have made 1000 miles on our course during the last 4 days nearly as much as we made the first 17 days I hope the wind may continue favorableFebruary 13, 1846 ~ Friday13th The wind changed to the west again during the last night. It is an exceding cold day like the bank weather of thecoast of North America we have a light head wind but a vary heavy swell As though there had been A Heavy blow or 
 immediately would be And According to the Barometer yesterday A cold snow storm set in at 10 oclok the snow and wind contin[ue]d untill 4 oclock which covered the ship with snow sleet & frost, it then increased to a gale And the Air so full of snow we could not see scarcely any distance the whole rigon began to be covered with ice & it was so cold the wheel & watch had to be releaved vary often to keep them from freezing it is a cold North wester the gale in the evening arose to A Hurricane And dreadful cold I never saw so gloomy A time for sailers All canvass was taken in except one or two small stay sails to steady the ship they then lit her d[◊◊◊] I never saw so gloomy a time at sea on board of A ship in the midst of A Hurricane, the raging billows pouring out there fury upon us evry thing stifning up with cold & frost No one knowing whats [next] the yards would be blown away or a mast go by the board or the ship spring a leak or founder & go to the bottomIt was Amid these reflections late in the evening that I stood on deck & gazed late in the evening upon the wild & dismal appearanc that surrounded me And raised A secret pray to my Heavenly father to protect us then with calmnes & composur retired to my bunk leaving all in the hands of God 
 No person can form any idea of the Awfully grandure & dismal appearance of such a scene without the sight it is in the midst of such seenes that I wonder And marvel that men enough can be found in the world to carry on the com-merce of the Nations of the earth by sea that can be hired to follow such a trade pass through such exposures & suffer such privations for the paltry sum of $10 or$15 per month. we however through the goodness of God And the strenght of a str[on]g oak ship passed through the scene withot damage the wind died away during the night & the gale ceased & we were all preservedFebruary 14, 1846 ~ Saturday14th It is exceding cold we have A fair wind run 10 nots an hour the wind again arose to a gale in the night And we had a dredful rough night we rocked andpitched so bad it made us sick we could not sleep & hardly keep in bedFebruary 15, 1846 ~ Sunday15th Sunday the cold is increasing & gettg into our cabins I have now been with my feet wet boots daily soaked with water 23 days without deing near any fire And we are now dailly obliged to go to bed to warm our feet this is the coldest day we have had we had a still night And we got a good nights rest 
 February 16, 1846 ~ Monday16th The wind has changed to the South East so we have A fair wind again we run about 8 nots an hour on our course we are now about 800 miles from New York it is not quite as cold to day as yesterday as we are getting further SouthElder J. A. Stratton Rehearsed Nto us A vary singular circumstan that fell under his obser-vation which was truly A singular phenonamen on the 22nd day of october 1845 in [FIGURE] company with some friends He went to visit A certain female by the name of Ann Comer daughter of James and Susan Comer living at the villiage of Farrington Gurney 12 miles from Bath 15 from Bristol Summersetshire England. She was A well sprightly child untill her 12th year At which time she was taken with convulsions & fits for 5 weeks when her joys Jaws became locked & eyes closed she lost the use of her limbs was ownly able to turn her head And raise her hand a few inches the last article of food she was ever knownto eat [was] A small bite of an egg this was upwards of eight years since during which time there has nothing entered her mouth or passed from her she breaths through her nose which seems regular and her puls beats regular but quite feble she has grown about 2 inches in length during this state, she looks vary plesant has her a smile upon her countenanceIt is the opinion of some the she was not insensible as incredible as this may seem Elder Stratton said He could not 
 find a doubt with any one in the Neighborhood of the correctness of this statement. He pressed her hand several times & recieved A light pressure in return the family had tried to keep it from being know abroad as much as possible her fingers nails have come off 3 times during the eight years but are at the present time are perfect many of the first Physicians in Bath have visited her some have spent three or four days at a time with her they have desired to have her removed to the Hospital but her parents will not Admit of itIn the afternoon we had a calm with quite moderate weather untill 6 oclok when a heavy squall suddingly struck us with 3 ^top^ gallant sails set evry exhertion was made by the whole crew to get the sail in as spedily as possible the gale increased for about one hour when it blew a Hurrycane but they saved all their sail but one gib which tore to atoms & blew away it was considered the heaviest wind we have had on the voyage it imme-diately raised a highsea sea & we had an exeeding rough night pitching tumbling rooling & Rocking untill I was sore tumbling in bed and trying to hold myself in It turned vary cold so that a person would be chilled through in a few moments on deck 
 February 17, 1846 ~ Tuesday17th The coldest morning we have had on board sails & ropes froze stiff And Ice all over the ship most of the passeger kept there beds untill late to keep warm it is vary tedious upon the sailors several of them are sick this morning through the exposures of the night there is but one of us in our state room out of bed at a time to watch & take care of things we take turns & go bed to get warm Any man that would sell a farm & go to sea for a living has A different taste from mine but I cannot write more now for it is so cold & the ship rocks so bad it is with difficulty I can make A letter.February 18, 1846 ~ Wednesday18th Head wind we are running South it is not so cold as yesterday yet it is quite uncomfortable we had a rough rocking night I was quite unwellI have spent most of the last two days in reading the travels of Edward Daniel Clark, L.L.D. through Russia Tartary And Turkey which I found to be highly interesting His style of writing is quite similar to that of Stephen He draws however A Horrid picture of the whole Russin Nation He speaks of the Cossacks vary highly He considers the meanest of them superior to the most noble of the Russian No Nation that he visited but what he gave a better character than the Russions 
 February 19, 1846 ~ Thursday19th We have still head wind but varystrong it is much warmer this morn[in]gI was quite unwell this morningThe wind increased to A strong gale at9 oclok they were oblieged to put the shipnearly under bare poles left nothing up butcloss reef top reef main top sail And one gibthe sun shone most of the day & it does notlook possible for the wind to blow so hardAccording to the looks of the weather, butit continued to blow a strong gale through theday yet we were in hops the wind would layat sun set but we were disappointed Andthe edge of the evening showed us we mustbe prepared for a most dismal night the galewas from the North West & clouds now beganto rise from that quarter black as ink & rose inthe Heavens with Awful majesty And terriblefury the gale immediately increased to A Hurricanwhich lasted through the night which wasthe longest & most dismal night I ever spentat sea we are truly experiencing A passage ofthe roughest class. I knew we were in a shipof the strongest class And my hope is whollyin that God who has carried me through allgangers [dangers] thus far in life. The wind & wavesincreased & continued to spend there fury uponus amid the darkness of the night we wereshiping some heavy seas when about 11 oclokA heavy sea rolled over us the main body ofwhich buried the Aft quarter deck As it passedAlong it stove to peases the compass house washedit against two men at the wheel it smashedthe wheel that governs the helm came nearwashing the men overboard it dashed the windowof the first cabin & water poured into 
 the cabin some Hogheads of water run fromthe captains cabin into ours when the seapassed over evry timber in the ship trembledlike An aspen leaf The mate informed us thatthe wheel was broken that governed the helmthey had to lash down the helm & let her rideuntill the wheel could be mended we gotup And Assisted about mending the compasshouse. No one can form an Idea of such scenessurrounded by the raging billows of the deepunless they experience them. The Atlanticis the roughest ocean in the world to navigateAnd we were in the worst season of the year But we spent the remainder of the nightwithout further Accident except washingof the door of the cook Galley & washingout a man who had fallen asleep in it buthe was suddenly aroused from his slumber by takingA ride on A sea several times for & aft acrossthe deck At length day light appeared whichwe were all glad to seeFebruary 20, 1846 ~ Friday20th The North west gale still continues thoughnot as strong As through the night they nowcarry closs reef main & fore top sails I am quiteunwell to day having no sleep for two nights inconsequence of the rough weather & tumblingof the ship I shall know how to prize theprivilege of on[c]e more setting my feet on landwhen I can get the chance of enjoying itwe made a good dinner of Apple Dumpling today made By Elder Stratton the wind diedaway towards evening And they wereenabled to carry sail again but we wererunning far South of New York

 the Latter Day Saints And thought if I would stay over another day He would be baptized I immediately consented to do so for I felt willing to make any sacrifice in my power to accomplish so desireable An object And be enabled to carry such glad tidings to his worthy Daughter Phebe who had made the request at his hands in fact I was so over wheled with joy at the thought that my eyes sent forth A fountain of tears of Joy And gladness I spent A vary plesent evening with him I knew it would require much faith And perseverance for him to go foreward in that ordinance in his old age in the midst of cold weather with the ground covered with snow And the water with Ice I read And Prayed with them And retired to there front chamber A spent the night alon for the last time in that House probably in this life I bowed my knees & offered up my Prayer to God for Father Carter & all the family esspecially for my Dear wife And children with whom I had spent many A sweet hour beneath that roof And who are truly worthy O How I want to see themMy Prayer to God is that they may be preserved from sickness And death.

The Morning came And disappoint-ment came with it for I found on enquiry that Father Carter had made up his mind not to be Baptized this time As the other page will show He firmly believed in the book of Mormon And in our faith but could not get an evidence that it was his duty to be baptized at this time I laboured hard to take away his objections but his mind was made up And I saw it could not be changed

Aftersinging Elder J A Stratton opened the meet-ing by Prayer. After which Elder OrsonHyde Arose And Addressed the Assembly fromthe following words. "what is man that thou art mindful of him or the sun of man thatthou visits him" My object says the speakeris to inquire what kind of A being man is.Man is As Eternal as God himself And isJust As much in Eternity now as he ever willbe after Death, the period called time isownly one portion of Eternity the same asthe outer wall of A building incloses manyrooms within or As the months Days, Hoursminutes or seconds in a year while in any portionof them we are in the year still, while we exhistbefore the world was, or in the flesh or after Death, it is all in eternity. The world opposesthe principle of Revelation And does notwish man to obtain knowledge in that way, butwhat Earthly Father that feels interested in the welfare of his children but what desiresto teach his children & reveal to them the knowledge He possesses And wouldfeel interested in there Advancementso with the Lord He gives gifts & knowledge 
 to his children, and the more intelligencemen get the more refined are there feelingsthe knowledge is great & so was his sympathyin giving his Son Jesus Christ to save manThe world may oppose Revelation but God doesnot. we have recieved Revelation & visions& God hath shown us many things it is truethese blessings have cost us great sacrafizeswe have been oppressed all the day long And atlast are now driven to the wilderness, butwe will go & not stay with the world, Andwhen we go we remove the candle lightfrom there midst And take it to the sons of Nature who have not shed the blood ofProphets. I will leave my testimony withyou, though it should be like A Harpoon.As respects the finishing of this house I will askwhy have we laboured to complete it whenwe were not expecting to stay. there is twosides to every thing but Mormonism as to thatthere is but one side on earth the other is in Heaven. If we moved forward & finishedthis House we should be recieved a& acceptedas A church with our dead but if not we should be rejected with our dead. these thingshave inspired And stimulated us to Actionin the finishing of it which through theblessing of God we have been enabled toaccomplish And prepared it for dedication In doing this we have ownly been saved as it were by the skin of our teeth. The enemyProphesyed we should not get the roof onbut we have finished it. And on Thursday night we met in this temple Arayed in ourwhite robes & dedicated it unto God And truly 
 An interesting season we enjoyed. I am willingto live And Die for the cause, you may wishto know what we have been doing in thishouse I will tell you. We have been anointing And ordaining Kings And Priest unto God. I have been Anointed A king & Priest unto God. If any one wishes to kill me for it let them do it We have laboured hard to ordain kings & Priest unto God to reign here on the earth but not now, but I will tell you when it will be.when the LORD JESUS CHRIST comes toreign and recieve his Crown And sit upon his Throne, The Twelve Apostles will situpon there Thrones & Judge the Twelve tribesof Israel then is the time we expect to recieveour crown And inherit this earth. We lookforward for A new Heaven & earth but it willbe the old concern made gloriously And renewedthose who have been ordained unto this office will be born at the resurrection in theroyal linage. If this religion Gospel & Priest-hood has not power to bind on earth and inheaven, it is good for nothing when A manhas recieved this gospel Anointing And endow-ments let him go to the dust but He will arise And take his place on his throne, thenwill the Nations serve And obey us. They arenow Persecuting us And there Persecutions are bringing gray hairs upon the Saints but the Heads of the persecutors will be coveredwith blackness. Men may have been ordainedfrom before the foundation of the world to haveperformed certain works, there are differentstations in the next world And men will be delt with here according to the deedsdone in the body A man ought to be good 
 Here as he grows older. A man that doeshis duty And obtaines the Priesthood andhonors it will have his reward. His exhaltationthrones & dominions according to his faithful-ness. we like our Master have desendedbelow all things so shall we arise above allthings I have seen this by vision we shallbe connected with the kingdom of JesusChrist. To the vary place And station willA man arise in the resurrection to which HeHas been sealed & anointed on earthIt is said that God will judge the worldso will the saints. On earth Presidents & Govornordo not Judge, but Judges apointed for the purposeso in Heaven we shall judge the world Holdingthe keys of the kingdom And will rise injudgment against our enemies who are heapingthere persecutions upon our heads, so with theAncient Twelve they will judge Israel for they brought evil upon them I see the thousandsof poor saints going out to the wilderness in thereoppressions drove out by wicked men, suchmen I will not bless but testify against themthey may kill me but I will speak my mind that man that has the Priesthood andhonors it, is God Himself as much asMoses was to the People we are sons of GodAnd Saviors on Mt Zion. If ye are the sonsof God ye shall have all things. He thatover cometh shall inherit all things, sit downupon my throne &c. The Lord owns allthe Thrones & will give us some. A man inthe Priesthood has persons sealed to him in his kingdom And is subject to him in the 
 dominions of God worlds And dominions are continually being formed which adds to the glory of God. Blessed is he who escapes the second death, evry saint has A guardian Angel with him so death cannot kill him the Angels accompanied the Ancients so they do us. The Angels of the waters & there was 4 on the cornors of the earth. when the guardian Angel is called away we are left to grapple with death. So with Jesus He said my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me. In three days the Angel returned rolled back the stone And raised the Lord the Angels will [not] stay away forever but will all come with Jesus Christ to raise all the bodies every man in his own orderthis is the way the resurrection is brought about. Jesus Christ was slain And buried yet Arose, assended on high And was crowned Lord of all so with the Prophets martered in Carthage Jail they must come forth And be crowned And sit upon there thrones And Judge there persecutors If ye were of the world the world would love its own but because I have chosen you out of the world there fore they hate you, but they must be judged of you at last. Man is destined to occupy A great place to increase in dominion And Power And this is the secret spring of our Action. I have A word of caution to all for one I feel to resign my citizenship because I cannot enjoy it. I would Advise all the saints that they cast not another vote in this state but resign all offices that they hold And all our friends to do the same I do not say they shall do it but advise them to. There is a 
 foundation in this that may serve us in days to come As our father And Mother or the Nation that has bourn us has rejected us And driven us out there is A National calamity At the door. All things are not known at once, this Temple was built for A certain purpose that is gained will we now sell, A vote was taken last fall not to sell it, but A key that will not opena door And shut it again is not A good one so if we have to sell the Temple to remove the Poor the People that make us do it must pay the bill & meet the consequences. All who are in favor of selling this House if it meets with the council of the Twelve manifest it by raising the right hand it was A unanimous vote save one Elder Hyde closed his remarks and was followed by Elder W. Woodruffwho backed up the testimony of Elder Hyde And in speaking of the martydom of the Smiths said they would rise in Judgment against Against this Nation, the state of Illinois Hancock ^Co^ And esspecially Carthage And the murderers it contains, they are the most suitable persons to rise in judgment againstthem, for they were martered by themyes the mob of Hancock Co had not yet got through with Joseph Smith for He was in the Presence of God and the Lamb in company with Abram Isaac & Jacob And was our senator in the Court of Heaven And would plead our cause And his own And knowing the cause to be a just will do sumthing that will have effect 
 The saints had laboured faithfully & finished the Temple & were now recieved as A church with our dead this is glory enough for building the Temple And thousands of the Saints have recieved there endowment in it And the light will not go out many other remar-ks were made by Elder Woodruff when the meeting & dedication of the Temple closed.May 4, 1846 ~ Monday4th I spent the day ^morning^ in the city vary busy getting ready to go about 30 miles into the country to visit Br & Sister Scammans I started with my mules & carriage & got 4 miles out of the city & got stalled in a mud hole & had to get oxen to draw us out I then returned home covered with mud & gave it up for a bad Job spent the remainder of the day cleaning the Mules & Harness &cMay 5, 1846 ~ Tuesday to May 6, 1846 ~ Wednesday5th & 6 I spent making preperations for the JourneyMay 7, 1846 ~ Thursday7th I had an interview with Elder Taylor who called to the returned to the city to settle his private businessMay 8, 1846 ~ Friday8th I went over the river to the campMay 9, 1846 ~ Saturday9th Our company from the east arived at night with our baggageMay 10, 1846 ~ Sunday[FIGURES]10th Sunday I wrote A letter to Mr Roe at Farmington I recieved 3 letters one from Br E.

He saidevil must be put down in the Camp ourcouncil held untill 11 oclockSeptember 13, 1846 ~ Sunday13th Sunday I met the Twelve & saints atthe meeting ground. Meeting opened by prayerby O Pratt who arose we have often been taught to listen to council given from the headI do not consider it necessary to treat to dayupon the first principles of the gospel as thosethings are understood by you as well as by me. Ihave thought of treating upon scientific Principlesthere is no truth but what comes from God, itrequires a portion of the spirit of God to know 
 what portion of truth to lay before the peoplesome classes adore the book of nature & denya God, others Profess to adore God and are afraidto contemplat Natural things but evry truth should be acknowledged as from God a varietyis interesting & not always remain in one channelone of the most interesting feasts I ever enjoyed was in contemplating the worlds and laws bywhich they are governed. Men should be learned in order to convince the learned for instansa man rises up & says I will not believe athing that I cannot comprehend by one of my 5 senses but the learned man knows that many truths come by reflection thinking& s & not by seeing feeling hearing eating & drinking & again an Elder may tell a con-gregation that matter is an eternal principle andexhisted before God made this world they wouldnot believe it because it comes in contact with theretradition for they have been taught to believe from there youth up that God made the Heavensand earth and all the planetary system in six days out of nothing. But let that Elder become acquainted with facts that can be demonstratedand he can present arguments to that people thatwill convince them the more learned the betteras a proof that worlds exhisted before this was formedor at least more than 7000 years let him present thedemonstrated fact that through the aid of strong glassesthat planets can be seen so far distant that it would take 24000 years for the light of them to reachthis planet according to asstrinomical calculationsthey then must be 24000 years old & just as likely to have exhisted millions of years beforeagain as a proof that matter is eternal and that this earth was formed out of unorganized matter 
 let a man take a good telescope at 4 oclock in a clearmorning & look at the sword in the belt of orionand he can see unorganized matter enough to makea Million of Million of Million of worlds each as large as the sun. A man of wisdon & Judgment candemonstrate truth for himself independant of allauthors and when he finds a thing is true believeit though all the world disbelieve it besides & whenhe finds a thing fals disbelieve it & renounce it thoghit be sustained by all Christondon & phylosiphersand asstronimers of the age. we should esstablishschools for our children to teach them principle &truth learning is a good thing a blessing from God &will prove so to us if we make a right use of [it] but abad use would prove a curse. but because some havemade a bad use of learning or even of the Holy Ghost& power of God as Lucipher in the rebellion ofHeaven does that argue that we should not getlearning or seak for the Holy Ghost certainly not.there are many hours that both parents & childrensquander away that might be spent in learning, butif our children grow up in ignoranc they withthere posterity would degenerat untill they would beas ignorant as the savagas that surround us. The Lordwill not do a miracle to give us learning when we canget it ourselves. Some have an idea that is no matterabout getting knowledge here thinking that by & bythat they will enter heaven & that God will fill thereminds with all the knowledge of the eternal worldsbut they will be mistaken in this for they will have to learn it little by little as here.Elder Kimball arose & said it was necessary for thisPeople to be subject to council. like clay in the handsof the Potter as to learning there is difference in menin this thing I spent one winter in learning grammer and all I did learn about it was the difference betweesingular & plural number what knowledge I ever didget God helped me to I desire to love that which is 
 our spirits ought not to stoop to any mean thing &our bodies ought not to bow down to any wrong thing& ought not to be defiled but to be used for noblepurposes and as our bodies & spirits are used for goodand good purposes they have no time to do evil butascendency is gained over evil & that spirit that hasthe power brings forth the fruit of its own work whether it be good or evil. He said while on thisJourney many said they would do so & so if thePresidency commanded them so Brigham had tocommand them before he could get it done butwe should do good without being commanded todo itThe Marshall arose & said there were some actspassed by the City Council which he would mentionthat there be no shooting of fire arms after sun downand no timber cut within 20 miles of here withoutthe direction of the Council. Also that dogs betaken care of & to shoot no more dogs without theorder of the Marshall &cPresident Young arose & said I wish to say a fewwords upon Principle I desire the brethren and sisters to be taught in all things necessary. Thereis one thing I want you to realize and that is that God, Angels, & Saints Heaven and all ofGods creation are governed by law and I wantthe Camp of Israel to understand that we mustbe and if Heaven was not controlled by law whatfor a place would it be I would not wish to be there for were we rushed into Heaven without law evry man would be in danger of loosing his rights & having them trampeld upon but allcelestial beings are governed by law & perfect order yea the celestial law is a perfect order ofthings a perfect system of light, law, intelligenceexhaltation & glory where evry persons rights aresustained to the fulest extent 
 but we do not arive at this knowledge at once, butas an Apostle said we have precept upon precept,line upon line, here a little and there a little, untillwe arive at a fulness of knowledge & glory eventhat fulness that reigns in the Heavens. wemust begin to be governd by law here before weare prepared to recieve those blessings. the wholelaw has not been given & you cannot abide the wholelaw as yet. if it had all been given, we should have been smashed up & destroyed a peoplemust become acquainted thoroughly with law beforethey can abide it but the time has come whenwe must have law oand order in our midst.There has been some feelings of late in thecamp because some unruly boys have been flogedby the Marshall for thiere wickedness, but ifthis camp is not willing to let law & order reign here & put a stop to such wickedness I wish you to let me know it & I will go away from you for those that wish to sustain crime & corrup-tion let them return & strike hands with themob & carry out there principles & be damm-ed. but if you want to do right say so, this peoplehave been driven here for there desires to dorighteousness. And this wickedness shall beput a stop to that has been manifest in thecamp by certain young people of late yes it willbe stoped if God come out & smites it byJudgment. The Marshall did not whipthem hard enough, if he had theywould not have spit out there revengebut it would have been whiped out ofthem. If I am drove to the necessit ofwhipping a person in such a case they willnot spit out revenge afterwards for I willwhip it out of them. Shall we any longer sustain in our midst men that will carry out the principles of John C Bennet and 
 other corrupt scoundrils no I will sware by the Eternal God of Heaven shuch conduct shall be stoped & shall not be permitted in this camp for if they continue it I will tell the Marshall what they the law is & they shall be taken care of in a manner that they will not whine and I will whip any man that will sustain it for those that will sustain it shall be whiped. And I prophecy in the name of God such a man whether old or young shall be bowed down with sorrow & morning even more than this people have. then stop before you further go & not sport upon the brink of sorrow & morningThis people have the Law of Liberty & the gospel & the more the light & liberty & greater the privileges the stricter the Law. we are going into the wilderness & shall we suffer such things no I swear by the Eternal God such things shall not be while brigham lives. Br Kimball gave a good shot when he said no man run into his waggon & swore he would shut the Marshall if he come after him except he was guilty of crime no man is afraid except he is guilty. No man need be afraid that does right. I defy the world to say I have taken any mans right but after we have been driven into the wilderness we are still followed by men who sware they will steal what they have in our midst, I sware they shall not have it in our midst. Some young Elders that never preached a sermon in their lives are afraid that I shall have more blessings than they, or more wives or sumthing or other but let them go & preach the world over as I have done in poverty 
 and distress with blood in my shoes & spent years & years at it & left my wife & children who have also suffered much. let them do as we have done & they will not be jealous of me about blessings. If the Lord should give me a thousand women is it any mans business No. Let such go and spend as much time as I have and there will be many clinging on to there skirts to be saved. the majority of the men of the gentile world will be damned and the women wish to be saved by going with good men. And a woman that has the spirit of God will go with a good man who has been withfaithful & spent much of his time in saveing mankind and has the priest hood such men if they continue faithful will be saved in eternal glory & those that are with him. I an determined that my affections shall be with God, I will not allow them to be placed on things that perish when plagues & diseases get hold of our bodies we become loathsome & beauty fades away but our affections should be placed upon things that are noble exhalted lasting & glorious I love an exhalted mind for it is eternal & cannot fadeI want all my affections to be subject to God and glory & eternal life. May God bless you amenSeptember 14, 1846 ~ Monday14th Monday I spent the day in laying out a city for the winters encampmentSeptember 15, 1846 ~ Tuesday15th In company with Father Woodruff & John Fowler and my family I started with my carriage & mules for a ride we rode 4 miles to the general hayfield I crossed the table land to the buff there left the family & carriage & we mounted our horses & rode about 2 miles to a lake about 2 miles in length & 1/4 mile wide 
 It was surrounded by high grass, weeds, & peavine the surface of the lake was dotted over with a great variety of ducks young & old geese brant &c. I shot 6 ducks & got 4 of them by waiding into the lake after them I waided for near a mile in the lake & weeds lost one of my shoes & had to travel bare foot Br Fowler was taken sick and in travelling through the high weed's, grass mud & water back to the place of begining I was exeeding weary, but before returning home I took my salmon rod & line & spent a few moments in trying to ketch fish but could not start any, we then mounted our mules & returned to our carriage, took the family & returned to the camp wet cold and hungry changed my cloths& retired to rest. 10September 16, 1846 ~ Wednesday16th A hard rainy day Br Shirtliff called upon me in the morning he had returned from the Punka village to get goods of Sarpee to go out on a hunting tour with the Punka & Sioux Indianshe said they had been vary kind to themI attended council in the afternoon. went on to the ground in the evening to pick out a lot. went at night to look up the cows in the dark got lost in the river bottomcould not find the bridge to cross the stream for a length of time at last I got home about 10 oclok was most sick through the nightSeptember 17, 1846 ~ Thursday17th Arose quit unwell in the morning I rodewith councillors B. Young H. C. Kimball & A. Cutler to the river bottom whare they are cutting hay, we found good land for farming purposes. I was quite unwell most of the day. I attended [blank] 12 miles 
 September 18, 1846 ~ Friday18th I went in company with the Twelve & others to the Mo river on a piece of table land to lay out the city or place for the encampment we abandoned the prairie ridges where we first laid out the place for the encampment in consequence of the block winds, we held a council with the H. Council they spoke there feelings were divided to a tie about there place of location President Young spoke his feelings about it & called for a vote to have the lot located on the table land near the Mo river & it was a universal vote. we examined the ground it was a vary windy day. 10 mileSeptember 19, 1846 ~ Saturday19th Saturday a vary windy day, early in the morning I was on the ground for the city plot in company with the Twelve & others. Br Young was the chief surveyer of the plot we laid of[f] lots sufficient to settle about 150 families. we set some hooks & cot some cat fish & returned home. 10 mileI met in council in the evening with the Twelve & H. Council. & several items of business was attended to. At the close I conversed with Br Young & others abut a report that hadreached our ears that the Marshall of the State of Missouri was on his way with a Posse to take the Twelve with some kind of a warrant O Missouri when will thou scease seeking for the blood of the Twelve Apostles and the Saints of God. there were 12 horses deposited on an Island oposite of us draggoon horses completely mounted for riderscapapie were put on by three men what the intention was we could not tell but such movements was watching 
 September 20, 1846 ~ Sunday20th Sunday I met at the stand withe saintsB. Young, Kimball, O Pratt & Woodruff of the Twelve were present. Meeting opened by prayer by the President. H C. Kimball made a few remarkssaid he had no time to be sick he had so much to do. If he lay down to be sick he would be called up so soon that he had no time to be sick & made remarks upon a variety of thingsPresident Young followed & said he could soon answer his mind did not fell [feel] much like preaching had to administer to the sick brethren [who] are labouring hard to keep soul and body together when I see the suffering that this people are enduring from the conduct of professed Christians I feel more like fighting & swearing than preaching for I see such strugling to live that I have feelings for the brethren to see them suffer for their religionI am glad I have not power for I should use it. when I have I shall have knowledge to use it. offenses must come but wo unto those by wholm they come. we are followed by wicked men who will lie about us & run to Missouri & say we are triying to kill them &c I hope such will go away & fall & die. Some are whineing because we will not strike hands with the devilI wish they knew right from wrong. the High Council are appointed to do business for the Churchwill they not do right yes they will regulate the affairs of cutting timber and all affairs for the benefit of the people. Some act selfish but I want to act for the good of all, because all things do not go to suit the convenienc of all some want to run to Mo but I want to let Mo alone 
 for they will rot in their own corruption and burn up but if any man wants to go & join the mob I hope he will get marked so as to stay marked untill the resurrection, other remarks were made & meeting dismissedSeptember 21, 1846 ~ Monday21st I spent a hard days work in stakeing out our new city or locationSeptember 22, 1846 ~ Tuesday22nd A report reached us that a mob or company of armed men were coming toward us from Missouri on the west side of the river. we called the men together in the encampment & organized them into a legion Brigham Young occupied his former place as Major General of the Legion Mr Stephen Markham appointed Collonel, Hosea Stout 1st Major Mr [blank] Scott 2nd Major [blank lines]And officers to fill out the legion, the whole numbering about 500 men including three companies of artillery men of 25 each the day was mostly spent in this way all were well armed and equiped for self defenceSeptember 23, 1846 ~ Wednesday23rd We removed our encampment this day from the prairie ridge to the table land on the bank of the Missouri River which was a beautiful place for a city the city was laid out in blocks of 20 rods by 40 each lot 4 by 10. I had one block for my company which consisted of near 40 families so I had to put about 2 families on a block. It was a vary busy day we had no yard so we lost many of our cattle at night 
 September 24, 1846 ~ Thursday24th I hunted cattle all day most of the division drew poles & made fence to keep the cattleSeptember 25, 1846 ~ Friday25th Square  Wells arived in camp also Br Cutler direct from Nauvoo I sat about one hour and herd them relate the state of affairs in that city the mob of Hancock county & the State of Illinois had swollen to about 1000 men had come upon Nauvoo & 100 of the Saints had kept them off 3 days then had a pitched battle ofone hour 20 minutes & drove the mob of[f] the ground with the loss of three of the Saints & how many of the mob was not known by us but as Br Wells will give a public statement I shall write it more full. I spent the day hunting cattle and lost my mule saddle bridle and 2 ducks I had killed I got wet & had to walk home. 15 milesSeptember 26, 1846 ~ Saturday26th Saturday I found my mule this morningsaddle & ducks all right I spent the day hunting cattle & exploring the country I found all our cattle. And traveld a long distance up & down the river. I also got wet feet to day halling several cattle out of the mud to save life. I travled during the day. 30 milesIn the evening a drove of wolves caught a calf that bauled at a dreadful rate untill he was dead it was heard over the encampment I was with B Young Kimball & Richard of the 12 untill midnight in council & retired to restSeptember 27, 1846 ~ Sunday27 Sunday I spent the morning hearing a paper from Missouri read giving an account of the battle between the mob & mormons of NauvooAlso of General Karney army of the west 
 among wholm was 50 of the Mormonsthere was a prospect of the whole armeysuffering for want of food. We appointeda meeting at 2 oclok in our new city tohear a statement made by square wells ofthe affairs in Nauvoo before meeting the cryof fire was heard on the prairie grass ofthe encampment & all run to put it out &it was soon extinguished.Meeting opened at 2 oclok PM at the CouncilBlock. Meeting opened by prayer by O. Prattwho also remarked that we had sufferedby the gentiles a long time; but had now goneout of there midst & hoped we should restfor a season from there grasp. had rathersuffer the fatigues of this wilderness journeyand live on game than suffer by mobs. wouldrather fall into the hands of God than a mobas God is more merciful. I have heard theprophet say that God could not controle thewicked at all times and let them act upontheir agency without operating upon them asa machine. I am contented whare I ambut should be more so if we had an abundancof the necessaries of life, the mob at last have had courage after gathering & threatning for about 6 years to come against the Saintsin Nauvoo from one thousand to twelve hundredmen had came against one hundred of theSaints and have a pitched battle, but the Saintswent out to battle in the name of God & their ene-mies were defeated.Daniel H Wells arose and said, I will by requestgive a short account of affairs in Nauvoo concerningtheir late difficulties. You have heard thatmen were lynched there. we took 15 of the 
 of the offenders who were sent to Quincy fora trial were let out on bail, the mob thenissued writs against Picket, Clifford & Furnicethe two latter went Picket would not a mob was then raised as a possee to execute the writs they said. they staid several weeks toincreas there numbers they had at firstabout 300. ^and increased to 1000^ the 100 men we had lay inambush for the mob they canonaded throughthe day but done no harm. Next day theytried the same again we repelled them. OnSaturday at one oclok they advanced upon thecity with 1000 or 12000 men we met them in the name of God and gained the victorythe action lasted one hour & 20 minutes theyfired 42 cannon ball & we 32 ball thoughthe mob were 10 to our one they were defeated &retreated from the battle field we had threekilled and none wounded. the mob would not acknowledge any killed but we walkedove[r] the battle ground & found a plenty ofmob blood. One man not a member ofthe Church said he saw them put 15 bodiesin one waggon that were handled like dead& other waggons were loaded in the sameway. one of the Saints lying in a suller saw8 wounded brought to the building each onetelling whare he was shot, they dug at thereintrenchment after the battle it was supposedthey buried there dead there. the next day was sunday they did not shute any we flungsome ball & burst one cannon on Mondaythe mob sent us a cannon ball to let us knowthey had some left & we sent it back agan during the fight the boys would watch thecannon ball strike & run & get it & bring itto us & we would send it back. OnTuesday a committee was sent to us 
 to make a treaty but it was rejected by bothparties a brigade was then called for, butafterwards a treaty was made. we agreedto surrender the city & leave in 5 daysOn wednesday evening the treaty was madeand the Saints bgan to pack up their goodsand the next day all goods was removedas the mob came in we left 2 blocks inadvance. we met many of the Saints onthis side of the river in distress & it drewtears from the eyes of some of the mobWe saw camp fires of the mob the samenight we left on both sid[e]s of the riverThere were scenes transpired in the siege enoughto melt the heart of a stone, the lynching of menwhen they are labouring for a living & whiping themuntill they cannot stand alone as the mob didwas a damnable thing they made them kneelon a spot whare they said some one was buriedplaced them in a position so they could be whipedeasy an old revolutioner was one of them and was so beat by the mob that he has not beenable to get about all summer. I have an oldgrand Father, a Revolutioner I have thought Iwould not let him know any thing about itbut keep it from him that his feelings maynot be harrow up as he is about ready to stepinto his grave. But I will say no more butgive way for Father ^Br^ CutlerBr Cutler arose and said I can bear my testim-ony that what Br Wells has said is strictly trueaccording to the best of my knowledge. If I wasto talk untill sun down the whole could not be told. I have been kept in Nauvoo by the handof God others wanted to have been here andwould have been had it not been necessary tohave stoped to save our brethren there who could 
 not get away. I know the hand of God has beenmade manifest in the salvation of the people inNauvoo I thank God I had a hand in the battleand the hand of God was so visible in that battle that many that were weak & faltering havebeen much strengthend by it and will gatherwith the saints. I did not expect that God would deliver their enemies into their hands butexpected that God would save them out of the hands of their enemies and this he has doneI was sensible we must leave Nauvoo the time hascome for us to depart God has called upon us togo and if we will not he will let the mob looseupon us to drive us out, but they will not get any glory for it but will have to sufferfor their wrongs to the. I hope the day willcome when we shall not have to suffer fromMobs as we have done. But if we had sought to have saved our lives in this case by fleeingmany would have lost them for but few could have fled. But we went out in thename of God and conquered through theblessings of God we done well. one brotherput on a sheep bell and went near the camp to spyout the enemy and they supposed it to be a sheep. The mob do not acknowledge theyhad any killed dut they had a good deal ofblood spilled which they could not cover up which I saw. Capt Smith who was Captof the guard at the time of the death ofJoseph was shot in the neck but not killed another commander was also shot, we have done thebest we could, to kill the poor Devels and weare satisfyed with the result and leave it allin the hands of God. Br Wells has done well 
 in all places where he has been put, in the midst ofdanger, as well as safety. with regard to the citizensof Nauvoo there were but few who stood by usin time of trouble there are many spirits in Nauvoo that are like bats ready to join any party that conquer if the beast conquer they will show therlegs if the featherd tribe there wings. we leftthe mob in the city hoping that the timewould come when we could gain a greatervictory over them.President Young arose and said I wish to makea few remarks attached to the remarks thathave been made. I will inform the brethrenthat have come up we are glad to see them. BrCutler has been with us before. Br Wells hasbeen in our society for several years and Ihave had considerable acquaintance with him and I am more than ever satisfyed with his course. we have prayed for our brethren con-tinually I am sensible there is a good deal of suffering there and here, but let me say the Lord God who has fed us all the day long, has his care stillover us, when the Saints are chastened enoughit will scease at least the hand of God will bevisible in there salvation, some individualsmay fall but the body will be sustained Ihave never believed the Lord would suffera general Massacrce of this people by a mob. If10,000 men were to come against us ifno other way was open the earth would openand swallow them up some say they can stay in Nauvoo and can live there in perfetpeace they are so righteous, there are somethat have no better eyes than to say let me livewith the wicked in peace but there blessings will be scearce with the mob, and if they do not leave I fear they will prove a scourge 
 in the hands of God. He works with the wickedby law and when they trespass upon hisrights God is there to maintain them. Manyother remarks were made by PresidentYoung when meeting was dismissed one hour during the intermission Elders Ivisited the sick council met in the afternoon and attended to some business on handSeptember 28, 1846 ~ Monday28th I went over the river & took a ramblefor house logs & some of the company dugout a canoe. 12September 29, 1846 ~ Tuesday29th I went up the river on the west sidein company with several others I cut 100house logs and returned home vary weary 14 mSeptember 30, 1846 ~ Wednesday30th I went up the river to day & cut about 100 house logs within about 2 miles of the camp. 4October 1, 1846 ~ ThursdayOct 1st I was nearly sick and confinedto my bed in consequence of hard labourOctober 2, 1846 ~ Friday2ndnd I spent apart of the day in councilOctober 3, 1846 ~ Saturday3rd I spent this day in council & the eveningOctober 4, 1846 ~ Sunday4th Sunday O Pratt deliverd a sermonon the first principle of the gospel had anintermission one hour.
