I had secreted a single barrel pocket pistol, about six inches in length, silver mounted, which I carried unobserved in my boot top, and after arriving in the jail, I handed it to Brother Joseph for his protection if necessary. My attention was called to it several times by Bro. Historian's Office, and I recognised it as the identical one I handed to the prophet.

He laid down on the floor side by side with the rest of the brethren; he lying on the east side of the row as they were down, their heads to the south against the wall; He asked me to lay down by his side; he stretched out his right arm and told me to lay my head upon it, which I did, feeling grateful for the privelege, but which I esteem since his martyrdom as one of the greatest privileges of my life.
