 of the Methodist church and a priest.   The timber is pine, fir, spruce, hem-  lock and birch, also gooseberries,  raspberries, whortleberries and upland  cranberries; bushes and timber grow   out of the crevices of the rocks.      There is a great amount and variety  of fish in the waters around these   Islands, viz.: whale, black fish, shark,  ground shark, pilot fish, horse  mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, halibut,   cod, pollock, tomcod, hake, haddock,   mackerel, shad, bass, alewives, herring,  pohagen, dolphin, whiting, frost fish,  flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp, shad,   cusk, blue backs, scollop, dogfish,   muttonfish, lumpfish, squid, five fin-  gers, monkfish, nursefish, sunfish,  swordfish, thrasher, cat, scuppog, two-  tog, eyefish, cunner, ling eels, lobsters,   clams, mussels, winkels, porpoises,   seals, &c.      Sept. 6—The harbor was filled with   a school of mackerel, which were  caught in great numbers by the people   standing upon the wharf.      While standing upon the farm of  Eleazar Carver on the north island I   counted fifty five islands, many of   which were inhabited.      Oct. 2—I left the island with Elder   Hale; Cap. Ames took us to Thomas-  town in a sloop.      —3—We walked forty six miles to   Bath.      —4—We attended a baptist conven-  tion, and preached to a large congrega-  tion in the evening in Pierce's hall;   the people listened attentively.      —5—We walked thirty six miles to   Portland.      —6—Walked ten miles to father   Carter's in Scarborough, where I found   my wife and friends well.      —9—I parted with Elder Hale,   who returned to Kirtland. I contin-  ued preaching through various towns   on the main land until Nov. 2, when   I again returned to Fox Islands, ac-  companied by my wife.      —15—I visited the Isle of Holt,  twelve miles east, and preached to an   attentive congregation, leaving them  the Book of Mormon, which they pro-  mised to read. I returned on the  16th.      I continued my labors during the  winter of 1837-8, and nearly every   person had attended my meetings,   and taken sides for or against. Our   enemies made attempts to break up   our meetings.      Jan. 15, 1838—A company of   sailors belonging to the United States  revenue cutter, brought on shore a  swivel and joined the mob, parading  near the house where I was preaching,  and discharged it several times, accom-  panied with small arms, with the in-  tention of breaking up the meeting.   Some of the mob gathered around to  see what effect this would have. I  warned them in the name of the Lord,   and proclaimed the judgements of  God that awaited the wicked, and   shook my garments in the presence of  the people, and told them I was clear   of their blood; but they only heard   my voice intermingled with the roar   of cannon and musketry. Before I  closed speaking, the sailors went back   on board the revenue cutter. At the   close of the meeting I baptized two,  also one next day, and while baptiz-  ing, the mob again commenced firing  guns. The Baptists and Methodists   got up the mob. Mr. Douglas, the   Methodist Priest, when argument  failed him, applied to all the magis-  trates for warrants against me; they  refused to grant them as he had no  cause of complaint.      Feb. 13—I crossed in the mailboat   to Hampden, and ordained James   Townsend. We walked together  through deep snows, and visited and   preached in the towns of Searsmont,  Belfast, Northport, Frankfort, Hamp-  den, and twice in the city hall in Ban-  gor, to large assemblies, and returned  to Fox Islands via Casteem and the  Isle of Holt. Arrived in Vinal Haven  March 8. Elder Townsend returned  home.      March 22—I accompanied brother   Stirrat, at low tide, on to a bar some   forty rods from shore, to dig some   clams. We were soon joined by Mrs.   Woodruff and sister Stone, who had a   curiosity to see how clams were dug.   The ground for about twelve rods  nearer shore was several feet lower  than the point we were on, but we  were so busily engaged we did not   observe the flowing tide until we were   surrounded by water, and having no   boat, our only alternative was to wade  ashore and carry the women, which     
 we safely accomplished amid the re-  flection that time and tide waited for   no man.      April 4—Mr. Kent, the post mas-  ter, showed me a letter containing two   sheets of foolscap, signed by Warren   Parrish and several of the Twelve,   who had apostatized and been cut off  from the Church. The communica-  tion was full of slander and falsehoods   against Joseph Smith and all that  stood by him. It was sent with the   intention of breaking up the work   upon these islands.      11—I was visited by Elders Town-  send and Milton Holmes, who atten-  ded conferences with me upon both  islands, and bore their testimony to  the people, but the spirit of opposition  increased to a great height. I was   warned by the Spirit of the Lord to   leave for a season and take a western   mission. After visiting the Saints   from house to house, and praying with  and encouraging them, I left on the  28th and went to the main land with   Elders Townsend and Holmes. Mrs.  Woodruff returned to her father's.   We walked to Scarborough. I left   May 7th, and walked to Bradford,   where I left Elder Holmes, and pro-  ceeded to Boston.      May 11—I gave out an appoint-  ment to preach at sister Vose's room,   and I went to Cambridgeport to visit  Elder A. P. Rockwood, who had been  imprisoned in jail on pretence of debt,   but in reality out of religious persecu-  tion. The jailor locked me in until   ten p.m.; but while it disappointed a   congregation of people, it gave me a  happy visit with Elder Rockwood,   conversing upon the Work of God.   On my return to Boston the people   were waiting to hear me; I spoke to  them a short time.      (To be continued.)     
 (Continued from page 296)      HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      May 14—I left Boston, and walked   some thirty miles to Holliston; staid  at Deacon Haven's, and preached. I   walked to Providence, R. I., from  thence took steamer to New York, and   arrived on the 18th. Met and at-  tended meetings with brother O. Pratt   until the 27th, when I went up the   North river to Newburgh, and preach-  ed in several towns in New York and  New Jersey, and walked across the   country to Farmington, Connecticut,   and arrived at my father's June 11,   1838.      I commenced preaching at my fa-  ther's house. July 1st, I baptized six   persons in Farmington river, inclu-  ding my father, stepmother and my  only sister, Eunice; also cousin Seth   Woodruff, aunt Anna Cossett and   Dwight Webster, a Methodist class   leader, who was boarding at my fa-  ther's.      When the Patriarch Joseph Smith,   sen., gave me my blessing, he said  I should bring my father's household  into the kingdom of God, which words   were fulfilled this day.      I confirmed those baptized, and   organized this small Branch of the     
 Church, consisting of nine members,   eight of whom were relatives. I or-  dained Dwight Webster a Priest, and  administered the sacrament.      July 3—I started for the State of   Maine, and arrived at father Carter's,   in Scarborough, on the 6th.      —14—My wife was delivered of a  daughter at her father's house; we   named her Sarah Emma.      22—I wrote to Thomas B. Marsh,   an account of my labors upon Fox   Islands and the eastern country.      —30—I left Scarborough and re-  turned to the islands. I preached  several times to large congregations in   the Methodist meeting-house, in East   Thomastown, and in the town hall in   Camden, before crossing to the islands,   where I arrived August 7th.      August 9—I received a letter from  Thomas B. Marsh, informing me of   my appointment to fill the place, in  the Quorum of the Twelve, of one   who had fallen, and I was requested   to come to Far West as soon as possi-  ble, to prepare for a mission to Eng-  land in the sprlng. I immediately  visited all the Saints upon both islands,  and earnestly exhorted them to sell  their property and prepare to accom-  pany me to Missouri. Several im-  mediately sold, but many were poor.   Brother Nathaniel Thomas said he  would furnish means to help off all   the poor Saints who desired to go,   and for this purpose went with me to  the main land on the 13th, and I   assisted him in purchasing two thou-  sand dollars worth of horses, harness,   wagons and tents for the company.  He paid about $1,500 of the expenses   himself, $1,000 of which went to fur-  nish conveyance for the poor. After  purchasing the outfit for the company,   I urged the importance of their start-  ing as soon as possible, not later than   the 1st of September.      August 19—I left the town of   Camden, where we had prepared our   outfit, and returned to Scarborough   to prepare my family for the journey,   expecting to see the company in a few   days; but here I remained in great   suspense until October 1st, when   Elder Townsend went to meet the   company. They arrived in Scar-  borough on the 3rd, with their wagon   covers flying.      The company stopped at the house  of sister Sarah B. Foss. We nailed   down the covers and painted them,  which made them waterproof.      —4—We started upon our journey.   My child was in the first stages of the  whooping-cough. Our company con-  sisted of fifty-three persons; we had  ten wagons, with a pair of horses to  each. We had before us, at this late   period, a gloomy land journey of two  thousand miles, from Maine to Mis-  souri. We continued to travel through   rain, mud, cold, frost and snow, until   we arrived in Rochester, Sangamon   county, Illinois, Dec. 19th, where I  stopped and settled my family and   company for the winter, being unable   to proceed further. My wife had   passed through a severe course of the   brain fever while upon the journey;   her sufferings had been very great.  Her spirit had left her body twice to  all human appearance, and only been   called back through the prayer of  faith and the power of God. Our   child had also been very sick, and I  had become so thoroughly chilled   through my whole system, in crossing  the bleak prairies, that it was two   months after I stopped, before I got   sufficiently warmed to feel natural.      Brother Thomas buried one child,   and nearly all the company had been   sick through exposure; some of them   had stopped by the way.      I spent the winter laboring with my   hands for the support of my family.      March 8, 1839—I attended a Con-  ference at Springfield, Illinois.      —13—I took my family and started   for Quincy, where I arrived on the   16th. I dined with Emma Smith, at  Judge Cleveland's. I then went on  to the bank of the river near Quincy,  and saw a great many of the Saints,   old and young, lying in the mud and   water, in a rain storm, without tent  or covering, which suffering was   caused by the unhallowed persecution  of the State of Missouri. The sight  filled my eyes with tears, while my   heart was made glad at the cheerful-  ness of the Saints in the midst of their  affliction.      —17 (Sunday)—I had an interview   with President Brigham Young and   John Taylor. We held a meeting   with the Saints; $50 and a number     
 of teams were raised to bring out the   remainder of the poor from Missouri.   President Young counselled the   Twelve to locate their families for the   time being in Quincy. I returned to  Rochester for my effects. While at   Springfield, I collected $70 for the  relief of the Saints in Quincy, which I   sent to them. I returned to Quincy   on the 8th of April, where I left my  family, and went to Far West with  the Twelve, and attended the Con-  ference on the Temple block on the    26th, where I was ordained one of   the Twelve Apostles, on the corner   stone of the Temple, under the hands   of the Twelve, Elder Brigham Young  being mouth. Elder Geo. A. Smith   was also ordained at the same time.   We returned to Quincy on the 2nd   day of May.      On the 3rd, in company with five  of the Twelve, I went to Judge Cleve-  land's, and had a happy interview   with President Joseph Smith, who  had just escaped out of the hands of   his persecutors in Missouri; it was  the first time I had seen him for more  than two years, and it was a happy  meeting. I attended the Conference  and meetings with the Saints in Quin-  cy, until the 15th, when I moved my  family to Montrose, and occupied a  room in the barracks with President  Young and family. I spent my time   in attending the meetings, Councils  and Conferences. I wrote in my   journal the teachings, sayings and   prophecies of Joseph from time to   time, as I had opportunity.      (To be continued.)     
 (Continued from page 312.)      HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      July 22—I was with President   Joseph Smith and his Council and the  Twelve; it was a day of God's power  with the Prophet. He healed many   who were sick nigh unto death, among   whom were Elijah Fordham and  Joseph B. Nobles; even the wicked   rabble followed to see the sick healed.   As Joseph was about to cross the  river, a man came to him and asked   him if he would go about three miles   and heal two of his small children,   who were twins, about three months   old, and were sick nigh unto death.   He was a man of the world, he had  never heard a sermon preached by a   Latter-day Saint. Joseph said he   could not go, but he would send a   man. After hesitating a moment, he  turned to me and said, "You go with   this man and heal his children," at  the same time giving me a red silk   handkerchief, and said, "After you   lay hands upon them, wipe their faces   with it, and they shall be healed; and   as long as you will keep that handker-  chief, it shall ever remain as a league   between you and me." I went and   did as I was commanded, and the   children were healed.      On the 25th, I was attacked with  chills and fever. I had a chill every   other day, and was very sick.      August 8—I laid my hands upon  my wife and children, blessed them,  committed them into the hands of   God, and started upon my English   mission, leaving my family sick, and   with not more than four days' pro-  visions. Brother Brigham Young   rowed me across the Mississippi in a   boat; I was sick and feeble. When     
 I landed, I laid down upon the bank  of the river on a side of sole leather.   The Prophet Joseph came along and   looked at me, and said, "You are  starting on your mission." I said  yes, but I look like a poor instrument  for a missionary; I look more fit for  a hospital or dissecting room than a  mission. He replied, "What do you   say that for? Go ahead in the name   of the Lord, and you shall be healed   and blessed on your mission." I   thanked him. A brother came along  with a wagon, and carried me a few   miles on my road. I started without   purse or scrip, and passed by Parley  P. Pratt, who was hewing logs for a   house; he was bare-footed, bare-  headed, without coat or vest on. He   said, "I have no money, but I have  an empty purse; I will give you that."   I went a few rods, and found Elder   H. C. Kimball building a log cabin.   He said, "I have one dollar, I will   give you that to put in your purse."  He blessed me, and I went my way,   accompanied by Elder John Taylor.   I had a shake of the ague every other   day, and lay on the bottom of the  wagon while I travelled.      We staid with Samuel H. and Don  Carlos Smith at Macomb, and held a   meeting with the Saints, who contri-  buted $9 to our necessities, and George  Miller gave us a horse. Father Colt-  rin was going east; he took us into   his wagon to help us along. We   spent five days in Springfield, where  Elder Taylor printed fifteen hundred   copies of a pamphlet upon the Mis-  souri persecution. We sold our horse,   and left on the 21st, and continued   our journey. We spent the night of  the 24th with Dr. Modisett, of Terre-  haute.      On the 28th, while travelling, Elder   Taylor fell to the ground as though he  had been knocked down. We admini-  stered to him, and he revived. On   the following day he fell again, and  fainted several times; it seemed as  though the destroyer would take his  life. We travelled with him four days  after he was taken sick. His sickness  proved to be bilious fever. We stop-  ped with him two days at a German   tavern, in Germantown, Wayne county,  Indiana, with a kind family with  whom he was acquainted. Father   Coltrin would stay no longer. I pro-  posed to remain with Brother Taylor,  but as I was sick with fever and ague,   and not able to take care of myself,   brother Taylor advised me to continue  my journey with Father Coltrin, say-  ing, "It is easier to take care of one  sick man than two." I committed  him into the hands of God, and the  family promised to do all in their   power to make him comfortable. I   parted from him with a heavy heart.      Sept. 2—I continued my journey   with Father Coltrin to Cleveland,  Ohio. I there took steamer on the   10th for Buffalo; had a severe gale,  and did not reach Buffalo until the   12th. I travelled to Albany on a   canal boat; had the ague daily, was   very sick; had no companions except  sectarian priests, who were daily ly-  ing about the "Mormons." I took   stage at Albany for Farmington, Con-  necticut, on the night of the 19th, and   rode all night and the following day;   suffered severely with fever and ague.  I arrived at my father's house in   Farmington on the 21st, quite sick.  I found my father and family well.      On the 27th Sept., 1839, my mater-  nal grandmother, Anna Thompson,  died, aged 84; I was too sick to attend   her funeral. It is a singular incident  that my grandfather, Lot Thompson,  and Anna Thompson his wife, Samuel   Thompson and Mercy Thompson, all  of one family, died in their 84th year.      On the 4th October, Adner Hart,  brother to my step-mother, died, aged   43. He requested me to preach his   funeral sermon. I had been sick at  my father's house, with the ague, for   fifteen days, attended with a severe   cough, and the hour appointed for the   funeral was the time for my ague, yet   I attended the funeral and preached,   and I had no more ague for many   days. I left on the 7th, and visited   New York, Long Island, and New  Jersey, in very poor health.      Nov. 1—I assisted Elders Clark,   Wright and Mulliner, to set sail for   England. Elder John Taylor had re-  covered from his sickness, and arrived  in New York on the 13th December.      Dec. 19—In company with Elders   John Taylor and Theodore Turley, I   went on board the packet-ship Oxford,  and sailed for Liverpool, where I     
 landed January 11, 1840, in good  health and spirits. When I left my   father, he gave me some money to   assist in paying my passage; also gave  me five dollars, which he requested  me to keep until I arrived in Liver-  pool, saying, I would there need it.   This I found to be true after landing;  that money was all we had to pay our   expenses to Preston, and we had two-  pence left.      We arrived in Preston on the 13th.   Had a happy interview with brother   Willard Richards; held a Council,   and agreed that Elder Taylor go to   Liverpool, Turley to Birmingham, and  I to Staffordshire Potteries.      Jan. 18—I arrived in Manchester;   met Elder William Clayton, who pre-  sided over that Branch, numbering   164 members. I was immediately  called upon to visit a woman possessed   with the devil. She was raging and   foaming, and had to be held by four   men. The more we rebuked the   devil, the worse she raged. We con-  tinued to pray and administer, until   we cast the devil out. She arose and   gave thanks to the Lord. The devil  then entered into a young child, and  we cast him out. I preached several  times, and laid hands on twenty-eight   persons. I went to Burslem on the  21st, and met with Elder Alfred   Cordon, President of the Burslem  Branch, which numbered 66. I com-  menced preaching in the Staffordshire  Potteries. Elder Turley left for Bir-  mingham on the 29th. I remained in   the Potteries some forty days, preach-  ing, baptizing and confirming, and  blessing children.      (To be continued.)     
 (Continued from page 328.)      HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      March 1—As I met in the evening   with a large assembly in Hanley, the   Lord revealed unto me that it would   be the last meeting that I would hold   with the Saints in the Potteries for   many days. I told the people it was  the last meeting I should hold with  them for a season; it created much   excitement. I had appointments out   for a week, which I got brother Cor-  don to fill. I went before the Lord in  prayer, and asked him where I should   go; the Spirit said, "Go to the   south." According to the directions   of the Spirit, on the 3rd I went to  Herefordshire, and called upon John   Benbow, at Castlefroom. I found a   people prepared for the Gospel. I  preached twice at his house. On the  6th, I baptized six persons, including  John Benbow and wife. I here found  a society called "United Brethren,"   numbering about six hundred mem-  bers, and about fifty preachers; Tho-  mas Kington was the presiding elder.   They came from all quarters to hear   me preach, and believed my testimony,  and I preached and baptized daily.   The ministers of the Church of Eng-  land sent three church clerks to see  what I was doing, and I baptized them.  One constable came to arrest me for  preaching, and I baptized him. In   about thirty days I baptized 160, forty-  eight of whom were preachers of the   "United Brethren," including their  presiding elder, Thomas Kington.      I established forty-two preaching   places, licensed according to law.      On the 9th April, I had an appoint-  ment at Haw Cross. As I was going  into the meeting, letters were put into   my hands from Elder Brigham Young   and others, informing me of his arri-  val with five of the Twelve, and re-  questing me to come to Preston, and  attend a General Conference. A vast   assembly had gathered to attend my   meeting; the house, yard and street  were crowded; a mob had also gather-  ed. I preached to the people; five   came forward to be baptized. The   mob surrounded the pool, armed with  stones. I dismissed the meeting and   went away, but the congregation and   mob remained on the ground till mid-  night; and as there was no prospect   of their dispersing, and the candidates  were anxious to be baptized, I went   down into the water and baptized five,   in the midst of a shower of stones.   The water was all in a foam for a rod   around me. None that I baptized   were hit, and I was only hit twice,   once on my hip and once on my head;   the blow on my head raised a large   bump, which went away while I was   confirming. Subsequently I baptized  many of the mob.      I left next morning for Preston,   and attended the Conference with the  Twelve, and returned to Hereford-  shire, accompanied by Elder Brigham  Young, on the 22nd April, and was   soon joined by Elder Willard Rich-  ards. Elder Young remained twenty-     
 seven days, preaching, baptizing, con-  firming and counselling. Numbers   were added daily to the Church. He   then returned to Manchester.      I spent about seven months in  Herefordshire, Gloucestershire and   Worcestershire. We baptized over   eighteen hundred, including all of the   "United Brethren" save one. We  baptized over two hundred preachers  of various denominations in that part   of the vineyard. A synod of church  ministers became so alarmed for their   flocks in that part of the vineyard,   they petitioned Parliament to adopt   measures to stop our preaching. They  received for an answer, that if they  were as well acquainted with the   Bible as their hunting grounds, and  were as much interested in the welfare  of the souls of men, as the chasing of   the stags and foxes, they would not   lose so many of their congregations.      Aug. 18—I visited London in com-  pany with Elders H. C. Kimball and  G. A. Smith. I labored with them   in establishing a church, spending   over five months in that populous city.      We visited nearly every part of the   city, and all the notable places that   we could have access to.      I attended all the General Confe-  rences in England, and set sail with   my brethren of the Twelve on the ship  Rochester, April 20, 1841. Arrived in   New York May 20th      (To be continued.)     
 (Continued from page 344.)      HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      I went to Scarborough, Maine, after  my wife, and also my son, Wilford,  who was born March 22, 1840. My   daughter, Sarah Emma, had died   July 17, 1840.      I returned to New York, and started   for Nauvoo, via the Lakes; was   wrecked on Lake Michigan in the   steamer Chesapeake, but arrived in   Nauvoo in safety Oct. 6, 1841, when   I had the happy privilege of meeting   with the Prophets Joseph and Hyrum,   and my brethren of the Twelve.      I bought a log house of brother   Tracy, on lot No. 1, block 106, on   Hotchkiss and Durfee Streets. Presi-  dent Joseph Smith afterwards gave   me the lot.      I spent the winter of 1841-2 attend-  ing meetings, councils, and laboring  with my hands. I attended the Nau-  voo House provision store until the   3rd Feb., 1842, when I took charge  of the business department of the  printing-office.      On the 5th of March, my daughter,   Phebe Amelia, was born.      Sep. 24—The printing-office took   fire in the upper story, in the midst   of a large amount of paper, and was   with difficulty extinguished.      I remained in Nauvoo, attending   council meeting and the business of   the printing-office, until the 7th of   July 1843, when I started on a mission   with Elders Brigham Young and Geo.   A. Smith, to the Eastern States, to   collect funds fo the Temple and Nau-  voo House. I gave bonds in the sum   of two thousand dollars for the faith-  ful return of all monies received.      On my return home in the fall, I  purchased a supply of paper and   other materials sufficient for the print-  ing-office for more than a year, and  arrived in Nauvoo on the 4th of Nov.      I spent the winter of 1843-4 in   Nauvoo, received my endowments     
 with the Twelve, and remained in the   printing-office until the 20th of Janu-  ary 1844, when I closed the business,   and left it well supplied with materials  in the hands of Elder John Taylor.      I built a two story brick house upon   my lot.      In the spring of 1844, I was ap-  pointed a mission to go through the  Eastern States with the Quorum of   the Twelve, and on the 9th of May   1844, I took the last parting hand   with President Joseph Smith, in his  own house, in company with J. M.   Grant. He blessed me, and bid me  God speed. I left Nauvoo in company  with Elders G. A. Smith, J. M. Grant  and Ezra Thayer. We travelled   through Illinois, Indiana and Michi-  gan, and preached and held Confe-  rences.      June 17—I parted with Elder G.   A. Smith in Franklin, Michigan, and  went to Boston via the Lakes and   Albany; met with the Twelve in   Boston on the 27th of June. I at-  tended Conferences and meetings with  the Twelve, and visited Maine. I   was in Portland, ready to step on  board of a steamer for Fox Islands,   when I saw an account of the martyr-  dom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith in   Carthage jail; the Spirit bore record to  me it was true. I immediately return-  ed to Boston, met in Council with the   Twelve, returned with them to Nauvoo,   where we arrived on the 6th of August.   I attended the Special Conference of   the Authorities of the Church, when   the thousands who assembled on the  occasion, voted unanimously to sus-  tain the Quorum of the Twelve Apos-  tles as the Presidency and leaders of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints.      I have ever been impressed, since   my first acquaintance with the Church   and kingdom of God upon the earth,   with the importance of keeping a   journal and record of the dealings of  God with this people, and our official   acts in the ministry, and under this   view I have written sketches of most  of the sermons and teachings which I   have heard from the mouth of Joseph   Smith the Prophet, and many of the   teachings of the Twelve Apostles and   others. Believing this course to be   beneficial, I would recommend the  Elders of Israel to do likewise, that  what is recorded on earth may be re-  corded in heaven.      CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.      (Written at Great Salt Lake City, Feb. 1858.)      Varied and diverse are the lives   and fortunes of men; while the paths   of some are strewn with flowers and   ease from the cradle to the grave,   with naught to disturb their peace,   others are marked victims of varied  misfortunes, accidents and dangers.   The last-named class is the one in   whose ranks I have stood through my  infancy, childhood, youth and man-  hood, up to the present time, so much   so, that it has seemed as though some  invisible power or fate was watching  my footsteps, in order to find some  opportunity to take my life from the  earth. I can only attribute the con-  tinuation of my life to the present  time to a merciful God, whose hand   has been stretched out, and rescued  me from death in the midst of the   many dangers and hairbreadth escapes   I have passed through, some of which   I will here mention.      When three years of age, I fell into  a caldron of boiling water, was in-  stantly caught out, but was so badly   scalded, that it was nine months be-  fore I was considered out of danger.      At five years of age, I fell from the   great beam of a barn, striking my face   upon the floor, which came near   breaking my neck.      Three months afterwards, I broke   one of my arms, by falling down  stairs. I soon after broke my other  arm, by falling out of a high stoop   upon a pile of timber.      When six years of age, I came near  being killed by a surly bull. My   father and I were feeding pumpkins  to the cattle, a surly bull drove my   cow away from the one she was eating.   I took the pumpkin he had left, upon   which he pitched at me. My father   told me to throw down the pumpkin  and run. I ran down a steep hill,   and took the pumpkin with me, being   determined that the cow should have  her rights. The bull pursued. As   he was about to overtake me, I step-  ped into a post hole and fell; the bull   leaped over me, after the pumpkin,   and tore it to pieces with his horns,     
 and would have served me in the same   way, had I not fallen.      During the same year, I went into  my father's saw mill, with several   others. I got upon the head-block to  take a ride, while the carriage was  running back, not anticipating any   danger; my leg was caught between   the head-block and the fender-post,   and broke both bones of my leg below  the knee. I was taken to the house,   and lay nine hours before my bones   were set, suffering severe pain; but   being young, my bones soon knit   together, and I was upon my feet   again. During my confinement by   this lameness, my brother Thompson  was also confined in the same room  with the typhus fever.      When seven years of age, I was   riding on the top of a load of hay,   which my uncle, Ozan Woodruff, was  driving to the barn; he turned the   load over upon me; I was nearly  suffocated for the want of air, before   the hay was removed.      At eight years old, I was riding in  a one-horse wagon with several others,  the horse took fright, ran down a  steep hill, and turned the wagon over  upon us; but again, while in the   midst of danger, my life was preserved;  none of us were seriously injured.      When nine years old, I climbed into   an elm tree to obtain bark. I stepped  upon a dry limb, which broke, and I   fell about fifteen feet upon my back,   which beat the breath out of my body.   A cousin ran and told my parents I   was dead. Before they arrived at the   spot, I came to my senses, and met  them.      When twelve years of age, I was   drowned in Farmington river, and  sunk in 30 feet of water, and after   carrying one person to the bottom   with me, I was miraculously saved by   a young man named Bacon diving to  the bottom, and carrying with him a   large stone, to hold him down until he  obtained my body, not expecting to   save me alive. I suffered much in   being restored to life.      (To be continued.)     
 (Continued from page 360.)      HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.  (Written at Great Salt Lake City, Feb. 1858.)      At thirteen years of age, while   passing through Farmington meadows,  in the depth of winter, the roads were  drifted with snow; and in an ex-  ceedingly blustering day, I became so   chilled and overcome with cold, that  I could not travel. I crawled into  the hollow of a large apple tree. A  man in the distance seeing me go in,   hastened to my rescue, realizing my  danger more fully than I did. When  he arrived at the spot, I had fallen  asleep, and was nearly insensible; he  had much difficulty in arousing me to  a sense of my situation. He procured  means to carry me to my father's  house, and through a kind Providence,  my life was again preserved.      At fourteen years of age, I split my   left instep open with an ax, which   went nearly through my foot; it was   nine months getting well.      At fifteen years of age, I was bitten  in my left hand by a mad dog in the  last stage of hydrophobia. He dented   my hand with his teeth, but did not  draw blood, and I was again pre-  served, through the mercies of God,   from an awful death.      At the age of seventeen, I was riding   a very ill-tempered horse that I was   not acquainted with; and while going   down a very steep rocky hill, the   horse taking advantage of the ground,   suddenly leaped from the road, and  ran down the steep, amid the rocks,   at full speed, and commenced kicking   up, and attempted to throw me over  his head upon the rocks; but I lodged   upon the top of his head, grasped  hold of each ear as with a death grip,   expecting every moment to be dashed   to pieces against the rocks. While in  this position, sitting astride of his   neck, with no bridle to guide him but  his ears, he plunged down the hill   under full speed, until he ran against  a rock, and was dashed to the ground.     
 I went over both his head and the   rocks, about one rod, and struck the   ground square on my feet, being the  only thing visible that saved my life;   for, had I struck upon any other part   of my body, it must have killed me  instantly; as it was, my bones crushed  from under me as though they were   reeds. It broke my left leg in two   places, and put out both my ankles in  a shocking manner, and the horse   came near rolling over me in his strug-  gles to get up. My uncle, Titus   Woodruff, saw me fall, got assistance,   and carried me to his house. I lay  from 2 p.m. till 10, without medical   aid; then my father arrived, bringing   Dr. Swift, of Farmington, with him,  who set my bones, boxed up my   limbs, and carried me in his carriage   eight miles that night to my father's.   My sufferings were very great. I had   good attention, however, and in eight  weeks I was out-doors upon my   crutches.      In 1827, while attempting to clear   the ice out of a water-wheel, standing  upon the wheel with one arm around   the shaft, a man hoisted the gate, and  let a full head of water upon it. As   soon as the water struck the wheel it   started, my feet slipped into the   wheel, but I immediately plunged   head foremost over the rim into about   three feet of water, and my weight  drew my legs out of the wheel, or I   should have been drawn under a   shaft and crushed to death.      In 1831, while having charge of the  flouring mill in Collinsville, Connecti-  cut, I was standing inside of a breast   wheel, 20 feet in diameter, upon one   of the arms near the top, clearing out   the ice, when a full head of water was   let on to it. The wheel immediately  started; but I dropped my ax and  leaped through it to the bottom, by  the shaft and arms, about twenty feet;  as I struck the bottom of the wheel,   I was rolled out against a ragged stone   wall, with only about two feet clear-  ance between it and the wheel. The   wheel caught me and rolled me out  into the water below, where I found  myself without any bones broken, but  with some bruises and much fright.      During the winter of 1831, while in   New Hartford, Ct., I passed through  a severe course of lung fever.      In 1833, the day I was baptized,   one of my horses, newly sharp shod,   kicked my hat off my head, and had  he struck two inches lower, would  probably have killed me instantly. In  ten minutes afterwards, while driving  the same team down a hill, on a sleigh   without any box, the bottom boards   slipped forward under the roller and   caught the ground, turned endwise,   and fell on the horses' backs, throw-  ing me between the horses; they ran  to the bottom of the hill, dragging me   with the lines, head foremost, with  the sleigh on top of me, about twenty   rods over a smooth snow path; I es-  caped unharmed, however, in the  midst of both dangers.      In 1834, while travelling in Zion's   Camp in Missouri, a rifle was acci-  dentally discharged, and the ball   passed through three tents, with about  twelve men in each, and lodged in a   wagon axle-tree, while a man was  standing behind it, and injured no   one. It passed within a few inches  of my breast, and many others es-  caped as narrowly as myself.      A few months afterwards a musket,   heavily loaded with buckshot, was   accidentally snapped within a few feet   of me, with the muzzle pointed at my   breast; it had a good flint and was   well primed, but it missed fire, and   my life was again preserved.      In April 1839, in Rochester, Illinois,   I was riding upon the running gears   of a wagon without a box, sitting upon  the forward axle-tree, when the bolt,   fastening the coupling pole, came out,   which left the hind wheels; and my   weight on the forward bolster and   tongue, turned the coupling pole over  on to the horses, turning the stakes   upside down, and shut me up fast be-  tween the bolster and tongue, but in   such a manner that my head and   shoulders dragged on the ground;   my horses took fright, and ran out   into an open prairie, and dragged me  in this position for about half a mile.   I managed to guide them with my  left hand, so as to run them into a   corner of a high worm fence, where   we landed in a pile together. I was   considerably bruised, but escaped   without any broken bones.      July 23, 1842—President Joseph   Smith sent me from Nauvoo to St.     
 Louis to procure a stock of paper. I  went down upon a steamboat; was  six days on the way, during which  time I was severely attacked with   bilious fever. The day I made my  purchase, the fever was so high I was   scarcely sensible of what I was doing.   As soon as I made my purchase and   got my freight on board, I took my   berth, and lay there until I arrived at   Nauvoo on the 10th of August. I  was confined to my bed forty days,   and passed through the most severe  fit of sickness I ever endured; my life   was despaired of by many of my  friends. I was administered to by   President Smith and the Twelve; my  life was preserved by the power of   God. I took a relapse twice after I   began to recover; once while in Coun-  cil with the Presidency and Twelve,   my strength left me, my breath stop-  ped, and I felt as though I was struck   with death.      Sept. 12, 1843—At five o'clock   p.m., I left Boston on the express  train for Portland. While passing  through Chesterwoods, six miles south  of Kennebunk, after dark, and while   going at full speed, we struck one of  the rails which some persons had  raised by rolling a log under it, and   landed in a pile; three cars were  filled with passengers, and their lives  were saved by having a long train of  freight between the passenger cars and  the engine; all of them were mashed  to pieces; the engineer was killed,  some of the passengers had bones   broken; I escaped unhurt.

 (Continued from page 376.)      HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.  (Written at Great Salt Lake City, Feb. 1858.)      On the 5th of October, 1846, while  with the camp of Israel building up   winter Quarters, on the west side of   the Missouri river, (then Indian   country) I passed through one of the  most painful and serious misfortunes  of my life. I took my axe and went  two and a half miles on to the bluffs to  cut some shingle timber to cover my   cabin; I was accompanied by two men.   While the third tree was falling, which   was an oak, over two feet in diameter,  I stepped behind it some ten feet, and  also to one side the same distance,   where I thought I would be entirely   out of danger; but when the tree fell,  there being a crook in the body of it,  which struck a knoll on the ground,   the whole body shot endways back of   the stump and bounded, and the butt  of the tree struck me on the breast  and knocked me several feet into the  air against a standing oak, and the   falling tree followed me in its bound  and caught me against the standing  tree, and I came down between them;  before reaching the earth, however,   I was liberated from them, and struck   the ground upon my feet in a badly  bruised condition. My left thigh, the   whole length of it, and my hip and  left arm were much bruised; my   breast bone and three ribs on my left   side were broken; my lungs, vitals and   left side were also bruised in a   shocking manner. After the accident  I sat upon a log until Mr. John  Garrison went a quarter of a mile to  get my horse. Notwithstanding I was   so badly hurt, I mounted my horse,   and rode two and a half miles over a   very rough road, dismounting twice in   consequence of miry places, my breast  and vitals were so badly torn to pieces,   that at each step of the horse the pain  went through me like an arrow. I con-  tinued on horseback until I arrived at   Turkey creek, on the north side of   Winter Quarters. I then became  exhausted, and was taken off my horse     
 and carried to my wagon in a chair.   I was met in the street by Presidents   Brigham Young, H. C. Kimball and  W. Richards and others, who assisted  in carrying me to my family. Before  laying me upon my bed, the Presidency   laid hands upon me, rebuked my suffering   and distress in the name of the Lord, and   said I should live and not die. I was  then laid upon my bed in my wagon,  and as the Apostles prophesied upon  my head, so it came to pass. I   employed no physician on this occasion,   but was administered to by the Elders   of Israel and nursed by my wife. I   lay upon my bed unable to move until  my breast bone began to knit together,   which commenced on the ninth day.   I began to walk about in twenty days; in   thirty days from the time I was hurt  I again commenced to do hard labor.      July 5th, 1848—While on a mission  to the Eastern States, I drove my  carriage, containing myself and family   into the dooryard of brother James  Williams in Iowa, to camp for the  night. I tied my mules to a large oak   tree several rods from the carriage.   As we were about to lay down in the  carriage for the night, I was strongly  impressed to go and move my mules  from the oak tree, and also to move  my carriage. I followed the dictates  of the spirit, and removed my mules to  a small hickory grove, also moved my  carriage several rods, and retired to   rest. In a short time a heavy rainstorm   came on, which broke the tree near the   ground, and laid it prostrate where my   carriage had stood. As it was, the top   struck the hind end of the carriage;   the tree was two feet in diameter.   Thus, by obeying the whisperings of   the Spirit, myself and family were  preserved.      On the 21st day of April, 1856,   while assisting to remove an ox that  had died from poison and had been  skinned, I inoculated my arm with  poison and mortification ensued. The  poison worked through my system for   seven days before it showed itself out-  wardly. On the 28th my arm began   to swell, was in great pain and showed  signs of mortification. I showed it to   President Young, who advised me to   cleanse my stomach immediately, and   put on onion poultices, and anything  that would draw the poison from my   system into my arm, which counsel I   immediately put in execution. The   29th was another trying day to my  life; the poison had so thoroughly   penetrated my whole system, that my   strength left me; I could not stand, I   was led to my bed, my bowels and   stomach ceased to act, my speech was   like that of a drunken man. President  Young called, in company with Dr.   Sprague, and laid hands upon me, and  rebuked the disease and the power of  the destroyer which had seized my   body, and promised me in the name of  the Lord, that I should not die but live   to finish my work which was appointed  me upon the earth. I soon began to re-  cover. The poison and mortification left   my system and centered in my arm, and   was drawn from my arm through the aid  of charcoal poultices, moistened with   a strong decoction of wormwood,   ragweed and wild sage; the dead flesh  was removed from my arm with  instruments and lunar caustic, and in  a few days I was well again.      I have occupied considerable space   in referring to those peculiar circum-  stances which have attended me   during life, and to sum the matter up  it stands thus:—I have broken both   legs—one in two places—both arms,   my breast bone and three ribs, and   had both ankles dislocated. I have   been drowned, frozen, scalded and bit  by a mad dog—have been in two water   wheels under full head of water—have   passed through several severe fits of   sickness, and encountered poison in its   worst forms—have landed in a pile of   railroad ruins—have barely been  missed by the passing bullets, and  have passed through a score of other   hair-breadth escapes.      It has appeared miraculous to me,   that with all the injuries and broken  bones which I have had, I have not a  lame limb, but have been enabled to  endure the hardest labor, exposures   and journeys—have often walked forty,   fifty, and on one occasion, sixty miles  in a day. The protection and mercy   of God has been over me, and my life  thus far has been preserved; for which   blessings I feel to render the gratitude  of my heart to my Heavenly Father,   praying that the remainder of my days  may be spent in His service and in the   building up of his kingdom.

 After regulating these accounts And writing  A peace for the Star As An farewell Address  All in the midst of A Hurricane of business  I bid farewell to Elders Hedlock, Ward,  Wilson And all others concerned And in  company with Elder Joseph Albert Stratton  I went on board of the Packet Ship  Ashburton of the swallowtail line 1150  tons Capt Wm Howland 1st Mate Mr  Williams 2nd Mate Wm Drummond with  4 cabin passengers 22 second cabin  passengers & about 50 steerage passengers  we had A state room in 2nd cabin at  mid ship oposite the main mast fare  £4 pound each All bound for New York  Elder Stratton & myself occupied the  lower berth in the state room & Mr  John Hastings Plesant Valley Dutchess  co N York An Irishman occupied the  upper birth with A man by the name  of Cox we spent most of the day  regulating our baggage And getting  ready for sea the ship remained  in dock over night & we lay on board  I lay upon a straw bed some damp &  with the wind from the Hatchess I  took quite A cold thus ende one of  my Hurried disagreeable day     
 January 22, 1846 ~ Thursday      22nd I arose quite Ill & went to Br Halls to  get some breakfast went to the ship & spent  the day but not a soul came on board  to see us but Br Cowley to do some  earands for us at 4 oclok we left the  dock and halled out into the river cast  Anchor & spent the night      January 23, 1846 ~ Friday      23rd we hoisted Anchor at 8 oclok &  And A Steemer hiched onto us & took  us into the Channel about 15 miles &  left us we then made sail for our  course the ship was However  searched before the Steemer left for  smuglers when 5 persons were found  stowed away in the Hold they were  printices [apprentices] had run away from there  Masters they were taken on shore And  probably had to return to there Masters  we sailed through the day before A  light breeze And while my wife children  And other friends are crossing the Atlantic  to New orleans on the ship Liverpool  I am now starting to cross the same  sea to New York May the Lord preserv  us all safe to meet again is my prayer      January 24, 1846 ~ Saturday      24th A Dead calm the fore part of the  day a head wind in the Afternoon but  light breeze I was not sick but quite  chilled we had A rough night     
 January 25, 1846 ~ Sunday      25 Sunday we have still & head wind  And Are beating in the Channel Elder  Stratton was sick last night, I Am  sick today but it works downward      January 26, 1846 ~ Monday      26th At is stormy today, beating against  A strong head wind in the Irish Chan-  nel do not gain any ownly hold our  own besides in danger of being  wreked on shore we are all sea sick  in our state room. Mr Hastings is   A Gentleman And A peaceable man  Mr Cox his bedfellow was of A different  Stamp He left our room & took up his  quarters with another man As he founly [found]  no gamblers or blacklegs in our room  we were glad to get rid of him as  he was A quarrelson man      we had A terrible night gale of wind run  under Almost bare poles dangerous business  this I pray the Lord to give us a change  of wind soon      January 27, 1846 ~ Tuesday      27th Still head wind we gain but  little I Am still vary sick it is distresing  to be confined as we are beating in a  narrow channel dangerous coast  head wind, And all sea sick we spent  A gloomy night     
 January 28, 1846 ~ Wednesday      28th An exceding gloomy day constant  gales & Head winds we do not gain any  Are still beating the Channel opposite  the Tuscan light House whare we have  been for several days we came near  Having A collision last night with an  other ship the Henry Clay going into  Liverpool, they ownly seperated as they  passed A few feet of each other had the  struck one or both would probably have  gone down we are all seasick pitching  And rocking so in the sea we have no  Appetite for eating anything. I never was in  m more discourageing circumstances at  sea in my life constant head winds danger  of shore rough weather sea sick loss of  Appetite long nights And to lie abed nearly  all day      January 29, 1846 ~ Thursday      29th Still dead head wind we are still in sight  of the Tuscan light we have now been 6 days  beating in this channel & ownly got 150 miles  last night was Also a tedious night to us. I trust  my family & friends are doing better on the  Liverpool than we are I feel vary anxious  to get to my friends in Con so that we can  continue our Journey west with the labours  And cares I have resting upon me it is trying to  be confined so long in one place doing nothing  the wind changed this afternoon so we  were enabled to make about 50 miles today     
 January 30, 1846 ~ Friday      30th The wind is again dead ahead And  we have to persue the old course to beat  against gales & stormes & rough winds I  was quite sick this morning And vomited  the first time since I have been on board  it is truly A gloomy day we had a gale at  night it rocked so bad I could scearcely  keep in bed      January 31, 1846 ~ Saturday      31st Rough sea & head winds we are all  still sick & no appetite      February 1, 1846 ~ Sunday      Feb 1st 1846 Sunday I arose quite unwell  this morning being rocked so badly through  the night we have a calm this morning  this is the 10th day since we left Liverpool  And it is supposed we are still in the mouth  of the British Channel opposite Cape Clear  about 300 miles from Liverpool about what  we ought to make in 24 hours with a good  fair breeze this is bad beginning certainly  what the end will be time must determin  I read the latest London times to day but  found nothing important in them It is  still gloomy times with us      February 2, 1846 ~ Monday      2nd This is the most cheering day we have  had since we left Liverpool we are now clear  of the channel and a good breeze from the  North west enabled us to run nearly on our  course about 8 not an hour it blew a gale  for a little time last night I slep well &  had some plesant dreams we are  getting some better in health & spirits     
 February 3, 1846 ~ Tuesday      3rd This is the first day on the voyage we have  heard the command to square the yards  wind is now favorable we run 8 not an hour  in the morning at 12 oclok the wind changed  again dead ahead we run the ship on the south-  ern tack we again have to contend with a  strong head wind, we shiped a vary heavy sea  And wet many of the passengers And upset  the Negros Cook galley there is one sail in sight  on our lee bow Elder Stratten Appetite is some  improveing Mr Hastings is still rather feble  A squll struct us at 3 oclok but lasted but a  few moments      [FIGURE] At 4 oclok one of the most exciting scenes  took place that I ever saw at sea. The  second Mate steped forward to the bow of  the ship & ordered one of the hands to  do sumthing on the bowsprit He refused upon  the principle that it was dangerous & a risk  of his life the Mate said He would not ask a  man to do a thing that he was not willing to  do himself And stept forward to do it while  at the same moment they shiped A sea  which instantly washed him overboard  the seas were running high & the ship going  8 not an hour the cry of second mate  overboard was instantly rung through the  ship ropes was flung to him but he cold not  get them the Bouy was next flung to him  He swam hard to get to it but He could not  get him it as the seas were runing so high  it floated to the leeward of him. The capt  then gave orders to wear the ship which was  done as spedily as possible still it took several  minutes the Life boat was let down at the  same time maned by Harry the Boatswain     
 And four others hands notwithstanding the  High seas they managed the boat well, the  Mate continued to swim for 15 or 20 minutes  amid the raging billows even untill the life  boat was within A few rods of him when  He instantly sunk to rise no more they  remained on or near the spot whare he  was last seen both with the life boat & ship  for near an hour but nothing more was seen  of him the life boat then came along side  And it was with great difficulty they got  on board of the ship as they came near  being swamped several times but after evry  exhertion being made they were obliged to  trim there sails to the wind & continue there  course & leave there mate in his watery grave  speaking loudly that while in life we are in the  midst of death the captain & crew seemed  much affected by the incident. His Name  was William Drummond An American, native  of Flushing Long Island New York his  Parents live near the city of New York  was A single man had been in the East  India trade with this same Captain William  Howland this was his first trip in the Liver  pool trade And was now on his return hom  was A stirring Ambitious young man was  remarking last night what pleasure He would  have in taking tea with his Mother on his arival  in New York but his hopes are suddenly  blasted And A Mother will be disappointed  Harry the Boatswain was Appointed to take     
 his place And all is going on as though nothing  had happened      February 4, 1846 ~ Wednesday      Feb 4th Dark and rainy light Head bree at  4 oclok the whole Heavens covered blacknes it   was expected a severe gale was at hand  all sail were spread when the squall struck  the ship all sail was then furled as soon as  possible the passengers went out to assist but the  wind soon changed to the North East And  the sails were spread before it And we had for  once A fair breeze but it did not last long but  shifted to various points we did not have so  rough a night as was expected      February 5, 1846 ~ Thursday      5th It is two weeks to day since we drew out  into the channel at Liverpool And we are not  yet 1000 miles on our way we have A comfortab  le breeze to day from the N West we can run  our course into 2 points to the southerd we have  A vary plesant afternoon the most so of any day  since we left we are all much better in health  And spirits And getting good Appetites there  was A fight Among the steerage passengers  one man fell down the Hatch way & broke  his cholar bone. I spent the day mostly Aranging  my Books      February 6, 1846 ~ Friday      6th A Steemer hove in sight this morning on her  way to Liverpool remained in sight about one  hour, we still have A head wind I was sea sick  at night we run about 7 nots per hour. we are  in constant danger of being destroyed by fire  through the carlessness of the passengers with  there pipes And candles about there straw  beds & crates of crockery filled with straw     
 February 7, 1846 ~ Saturday      7th Saturday I was sea sick this morning   And vomited some we have still head wind   And make but slow progress which is vary   discourageing to us considering our situation   as our business requires haste but we would   console ourselves the best we could each one   would tell what he would do when he got   on shore we first would take a dish of oysters   together I would take A keg of oysters &   some clams And A fresh codfish to My father   & Mother from New Haven (I must see that   I do it) each one was to take there friends   sumthing so we would occasionally feed   upon these reflections. One man A steerage   passenger got several buckets of water flung   on to him & the ropes end for his filthiness   about the floor. The man thate broke his   choler bone is getting better      February 8, 1846 ~ Sunday      8th Sunday I had some plesant dreams last   night in visiting my friends when I awoke   the first sound I heard was from the steward   saying After so long a time the wind has changed   in our favor And that we were running on   our course 11 1/2 nots an hour before a good   fare breeze this was Joyful news to us it   cheered up our spirits As we had been   warring Against Head winds ever since   we had left Liverpool over 17 day during   which time we had got ownly about 1200 miles   And we have got nearly 3000 miles yet to go  we dressed ourselves & went on deck And it   was truly a glorious view All the sails were   well filled & we were plunging through the ocean   like the horse rushing to battle, the log was     
 flung at 12 oclok And it was found the ship   was running 13 not an hour on our course   As we have had bad beginning I hope we   may have good ending. A squall struck   us at 4 oclok the Log was flung All the   line run from the reel befor the sand was   out it was supposed to be running 14 not an hour   which is as fast as the ship could sail   this is the first day we have had a fair wind   A whole day sinc we left Liverpool      February 9, 1846 ~ Monday      9th We have had an Easterly wind through   the night which has caused the ship to   roll in the trough of the sea untill Boxes   trunks cans &c were tumbling through   the ship & we could scarcely keep his   our berths we are going 10 not an hour   this morning on our course we have made   400 miles since the wind changed we   are having a rough day in consequence of   the rocking of the ship      February 10, 1846 ~ Tuesday      10th A fair wind but light breeze we run 5 nots   in the evening A strong breeze fair wind   smooth sea run 13 nots we had A good   short cake & Apple Dumplings for dinner   All sail is set I never saw a ship carry   so much sail in strong winds And gales as   the Ashburton      February 11, 1846 ~ Wednesday      11th We have this morning A strong South   East wind with fore & main top gallant sails   set we run 13 nots an hour on the course   this is truly incourageing And things are turning   in our favor they have so much canvass     
 up it tries the whole strength of the ship   most ships with the same wind would   be under closs reef top sails I spent the   day in writing. A gale struck us at 4 oclok   though the wind was fare the ship was   immediately put under closs reef top sail   & they let her drive on her course some   of the time strong gusts would strike her   And make her tremble, it was the roughest   night we have had on the voyage but   the Byrometer to day speaks of a still greater   storm ahead seas are vary high      February 12, 1846 ~ Thursday      12th Seas High & rough this morning   the wind still continues vary strong from   the South East we are still under reef   top sails though they make A little sail   this morning we all felt some unwell   it is supposed we shall reach the Bank of   Newfoundland this evening at 6 ocl[ock] the capt   had the lead cast for soundings we have   made 1000 miles on our course during the last   4 days nearly as much as we made the   first 17 days I hope the wind may   continue favorable      February 13, 1846 ~ Friday      13th The wind changed to the west again   during the last night. It is an exceding   cold day like the bank weather of the  coast of North America we have a light   head wind but a vary heavy swell As   though there had been A Heavy blow or     
 immediately would be And According to the   Barometer yesterday A cold snow storm   set in at 10 oclok the snow and wind contin[ue]d   untill 4 oclock which covered the ship with   snow sleet & frost, it then increased to   a gale And the Air so full of snow we   could not see scarcely any distance the   whole rigon began to be covered with ice   & it was so cold the wheel & watch had   to be releaved vary often to keep them   from freezing it is a cold North wester   the gale in the evening arose to A Hurricane   And dreadful cold I never saw so gloomy   A time for sailers All canvass was taken   in except one or two small stay sails to   steady the ship they then lit her d[◊◊◊]   I never saw so gloomy a time at sea on   board of A ship in the midst of A Hurrica  ne, the raging billows pouring out there   fury upon us evry thing stifning up with   cold & frost No one knowing whats [next]   the yards would be blown away or a   mast go by the board or the ship spring   a leak or founder & go to the bottom  It was Amid these reflections late in   the evening that I stood on deck & gazed   late in the evening upon the wild & dismal   appearanc that surrounded me And raised   A secret pray to my Heavenly father to   protect us then with calmnes & composur   retired to my bunk leaving all in the hands   of God     
 No person can form any idea of the   Awfully grandure & dismal appearance of   such a scene without the sight it is in   the midst of such seenes that I wonder   And marvel that men enough can be   found in the world to carry on the com-  merce of the Nations of the earth by sea   that can be hired to follow such a trade   pass through such exposures & suffer such   privations for the paltry sum of $10 or  $15 per month. we however through the   goodness of God And the strenght of a str[on]g   oak ship passed through the scene withot   damage the wind died away during the   night & the gale ceased & we were all preser  ved      February 14, 1846 ~ Saturday      14th It is exceding cold we have A fair   wind run 10 nots an hour the wind again   arose to a gale in the night And we had a   dredful rough night we rocked and  pitched so bad it made us sick we   could not sleep & hardly keep in bed      February 15, 1846 ~ Sunday      15th Sunday the cold is increasing & gettg   into our cabins I have now been with   my feet wet boots daily soaked with   water 23 days without deing near any   fire And we are now dailly obliged to   go to bed to warm our feet this is   the coldest day we have had we   had a still night And we got a good nights   rest     
 February 16, 1846 ~ Monday      16th The wind has changed to the South   East so we have A fair wind again we run   about 8 nots an hour on our course we are   now about 800 miles from New York   it is not quite as cold to day as yesterday   as we are getting further South      Elder J. A. Stratton Rehearsed Nto us A vary   singular circumstan that fell under his obser-  vation which was truly A singular pheno  namen on the 22nd day of october 1845 in   [FIGURE] company with some friends He went to visit   A certain female by the name of Ann Comer   daughter of James and Susan Comer living   at the villiage of Farrington Gurney 12 miles   from Bath 15 from Bristol Summersetshire   England. She was A well sprightly child   untill her 12th year At which time she was   taken with convulsions & fits for 5 weeks   when her joys Jaws became locked & eyes   closed she lost the use of her limbs   was ownly able to turn her head   And raise her hand a few inches the   last article of food she was ever known  to eat [was] A small bite of an egg this was   upwards of eight years since during   which time there has nothing entered her   mouth or passed from her she breaths   through her nose which seems regular   and her puls beats regular but quite   feble she has grown about 2 inches in length   during this state, she looks vary plesant   has her a smile upon her countenance  It is the opinion of some the she was   not insensible as incredible as this may   seem Elder Stratton said He could not     
 find a doubt with any one in the   Neighborhood of the correctness of this   statement. He pressed her hand several   times & recieved A light pressure in return   the family had tried to keep it from   being know abroad as much as possible   her fingers nails have come off 3 times   during the eight years but are at the   present time are perfect many of the   first Physicians in Bath have visited   her some have spent three or four days   at a time with her they have desired   to have her removed to the Hospital but   her parents will not Admit of it      In the afternoon we had a calm with   quite moderate weather untill 6 oclok   when a heavy squall suddingly struck   us with 3 ^top^ gallant sails set evry exherti  on was made by the whole crew to get   the sail in as spedily as possible the   gale increased for about one hour   when it blew a Hurrycane but they   saved all their sail but one gib   which tore to atoms & blew away   it was considered the heaviest wind   we have had on the voyage it imme-  diately raised a highsea sea & we   had an exeeding rough night pitching   tumbling rooling & Rocking untill I   was sore tumbling in bed and trying   to hold myself in It turned vary   cold so that a person would be chilled   through in a few moments on deck     
 February 17, 1846 ~ Tuesday      17th The coldest morning we have had   on board sails & ropes froze stiff And   Ice all over the ship most of the passeger   kept there beds untill late to keep warm   it is vary tedious upon the sailors several   of them are sick this morning through   the exposures of the night there is   but one of us in our state room out   of bed at a time to watch & take care   of things we take turns & go bed to get   warm Any man that would sell a farm   & go to sea for a living has A   different taste from mine but I   cannot write more now for it is so   cold & the ship rocks so bad it is with   difficulty I can make A letter.      February 18, 1846 ~ Wednesday      18th Head wind we are running South it   is not so cold as yesterday yet it is   quite uncomfortable we had a rough   rocking night I was quite unwell  I have spent most of the last two days   in reading the travels of   Edward Daniel Clark, L.L.D. through   Russia Tartary And Turkey which I   found to be highly interesting His style   of writing is quite similar to that   of Stephen He draws however A Horrid   picture of the whole Russin Nation   He speaks of the Cossacks vary highly   He considers the meanest of them   superior to the most noble of the   Russian No Nation that he visited but   what he gave a better character than   the Russions     
 February 19, 1846 ~ Thursday      19th We have still head wind but vary  strong it is much warmer this morn[in]g  I was quite unwell this morning  The wind increased to A strong gale at  9 oclok they were oblieged to put the ship  nearly under bare poles left nothing up but  closs reef top reef main top sail And one gib  the sun shone most of the day & it does not  look possible for the wind to blow so hard  According to the looks of the weather, but  it continued to blow a strong gale through the  day yet we were in hops the wind would lay  at sun set but we were disappointed And  the edge of the evening showed us we must  be prepared for a most dismal night the gale  was from the North West & clouds now began  to rise from that quarter black as ink & rose in  the Heavens with Awful majesty And terrible  fury the gale immediately increased to A Hurrican  which lasted through the night which was  the longest & most dismal night I ever spent  at sea we are truly experiencing A passage of  the roughest class. I knew we were in a ship  of the strongest class And my hope is wholly  in that God who has carried me through all  gangers [dangers] thus far in life. The wind & waves  increased & continued to spend there fury upon  us amid the darkness of the night we were  shiping some heavy seas when about 11 oclok  A heavy sea rolled over us the main body of  which buried the Aft quarter deck As it passed  Along it stove to peases the compass house washed  it against two men at the wheel it smashed  the wheel that governs the helm came near  washing the men overboard it dashed the window  of the first cabin & water poured into     
 the cabin some Hogheads of water run from  the captains cabin into ours when the sea  passed over evry timber in the ship trembled  like An aspen leaf The mate informed us that  the wheel was broken that governed the helm  they had to lash down the helm & let her ride  untill the wheel could be mended we got  up And Assisted about mending the compass  house. No one can form an Idea of such scenes  surrounded by the raging billows of the deep  unless they experience them. The Atlantic  is the roughest ocean in the world to navigate  And we were in the worst season of the year   But we spent the remainder of the night  without further Accident except washing  of the door of the cook Galley & washing  out a man who had fallen asleep in it but  he was suddenly aroused from his slumber by taking  A ride on A sea several times for & aft across  the deck At length day light appeared which  we were all glad to see      February 20, 1846 ~ Friday      20th The North west gale still continues though  not as strong As through the night they now  carry closs reef main & fore top sails I am quite  unwell to day having no sleep for two nights in  consequence of the rough weather & tumbling  of the ship I shall know how to prize the  privilege of on[c]e more setting my feet on land  when I can get the chance of enjoying it  we made a good dinner of Apple Dumpling to  day made By Elder Stratton the wind died  away towards evening And they were  enabled to carry sail again but we were  running far South of New York     
 February 21, 1846 ~ Saturday      Feb 21st We had quite A comfortable still  night last night wind has changed to  the South West And we have a smooth  sea we tack ship at 6 oclock this morning  on the Northern which enables us to run  nearly our course for the hard N western  gales has blown us south of the gulf stream  nearly opposite the Bermuda Island but  we are now again running towards N York  about 10 not an hour. My stomach is  much out of order constant risings of  the stomach causes me to spit so much  that it is vary injurious to my health  wind turned against us again in the  afternoon it again blew a gale in the evening  & nearly all sail was taken in And  we had an other rough night we  gain but little if any on our journey  we are sumthing as at the beginning  testing about against head winds  without making head way      February 22, 1846 ~ Sunday      22nd [FIGURE] Sunday A child about 10 years  of Age A Daughter of of Mr  Brown died on board last night And  it is expected the corps will be  buried in the sea this Afternoon  the sea is rough this morning  we have A Northerly wind we  cannot run within several points   of our course      At half past 11 oclok the corps was put  in a wooden box similar to A coffin  boared with holes to fill with water     
 the coffin had stones in the foot of  it to sink it, it was then slid into the  sea from a board feet foremost at a  signal from the captain but it did  not sink but we saw it swiming  near half a mile from the Ship  the parents of the child was catholic   And there was no service performed  over it by request of her parents      February 23, 1846 ~ Monday      23rd We are still strugling against strong head  North West winds And vary squalley we do  not make any head way it is vary discourageing  to us we are running North And South contin-  ually but not towards New York we had  a rough night      February 24, 1846 ~ Tuesday      24th We are still beating Against Headwind  And most discouraged we seem about as  bad off in the ending as we were in the beginig  there is A ship in sight this morning to the  windard of us the first sail we have seen  for about 20 days we are all feble in health  this morning And depressed in spirit as  we have so much to do And so little time  to do it in And still we are not Advancing  on our Journey      February 25, 1846 ~ Wednesday      25th we have still head wind And gain but  vary slowley we paid 25 cts for beaking a  loaf of bread so we haed warm bread And  butter for Breakfast which we realished much  I had A long night last night lay for hours  awake in a long train of meditation finally  fel asleep & dreamed of seeing my wife &  children but awoke And it was A dream

The wind blew exceding hard  through the day And the night was dark  terrible dreadful & gloomy it blew a Hurricane  nearly all night head wind few marriners  ever experienced a rougher passage across the  Atlantic than we have done thus far many     
 ships would not have lived through such  a constant scene of Gales & Hurricanes for  so many days as we have had but would  have swamped & gone to the bottom   but the Ashburton is A strong New oakship  of the largest class And has thus far  out rode all storms & gales well which has  been a blessing to us      February 28, 1846 ~ Saturday      Feb 28th 1846 Saturday this is the last day  of feb & of winter and here we are riding   still upon the mountain billows of the great  deep the wind is still dead ahead the sea is  not quite so rough this morning & the gale  is lade in some degree yet some sudden  gusts & squalls are striking us it is quite  cold this morning we are running North  we are now 36 days out from Liverpool  And no outward prospect of its being  better we do not gain any at all  I dreamed last night that there was a great storm  that killed thousands of Birds that were  floating upon the water I saw many that  were not quite dead I waided in 2 or thre  feet of water & picked out out many of  them & put them under a goose that  was sitting & they were warmed brought  to life & run about lively & well   it was quite rough through the day  we have lost near 100 miles in two days  but the wind changed during the night  to the North East which was A fair   wind how long it will hold the Lord  knoweth. The wind blew so hard before the  ^it^ wind changed that it tore there Gib top sail  to ribbons & carried most of it away

I Found Father Carter   & Fabyan all well & Rhoda. I think Mary has   Failed she was pleased to see me, we all spent   the night at Father Carters And had a good time   father bears his age well. He informed me   that Mother Carters spirit appeared to him   almost evry night A few nights Ago she   was with him put her arms around his neck   And leaned upon him Father asked her   why she did so she says because I pitty you  During the evening I informed Father Carter   of Phebes last request that Father would   be baptized & recieve the Priesthood And   my feelings were vary peculier when he   informed me that He had had a desire at   times of Being Baptised by the s an Elder of     
 the Latter Day Saints And thought if   I would stay over another day He would   be baptized I immediately consented to do   so for I felt willing to make any sacrifice in   my power to accomplish so desireable An object   And be enabled to carry such glad tidings to   his worthy Daughter Phebe who had made the   request at his hands in fact I was so over wheled   with joy at the thought that my eyes sent forth   A fountain of tears of Joy And gladness I spent   A vary plesent evening with him I knew it would   require much faith And perseverance for him   to go foreward in that ordinance in his old age   in the midst of cold weather with the ground   covered with snow And the water with Ice   I read And Prayed with them And retired to   there front chamber A spent the night alon for   the last time in that House probably in this life I   bowed my knees & offered up my Prayer to God for   Father Carter & all the family esspecially for my   Dear wife And children with whom I had spent   many A sweet hour beneath that roof And who   are truly worthy O How I want to see them  My Prayer to God is that they may be preserved   from sickness And death. I had many peculier   meditations upon my bed during the night   I thought of the whole family esspecially the   sacrifizes that Phebe And myself had made to-  gether I felt more anxious than ever that we   might spend an eternity together with the   posterity which God had given us, But I fell   asleep And when I awoke the sun was shining   in my Room. The Morning came And disappoint-  ment came with it for I found on enquiry that   Father Carter had made up his mind not to be   Baptized this time As the other page will show He   firmly believed in the book of Mormon And in our   faith but could not get an evidence that it was   his duty to be baptized at this time I laboured   hard to take away his objections but his mind was   made up And I saw it could not be changed     
 March 18, 1846 ~ Wednesday      18 [FIGURE] I Arose found the sun shining plesant  I went below found Father ready for  Breakfast it is his birth Day EZRA CARTER  sen is [FIGURE] 73 years old this day He informed   me that he had meditated much upon the  subject of being baptized by me before  I left but it was A vary cold day the  snow over the ground And water frooze  over And he could not get an evidence  that it was his duty then And thought   it best to omit it. So I thought it best  to continue my Journey as I was so  late in the season Father Carter walked  with me to see Mother Carters grave  we walked on top of the snow crust but  found the grave bare Father Carter  Pointed to the ground beside her grave  And said that place will soon be my  bed. I plucked some Pebbles from Mother   Carters grave to take to Phebe I then  returned to the house bought some calf  skin And Father Carter made Phebe   A Present of one which I took with me  I took some of Father Carters Hair  And the rest of the family except  Mothers Carters And there was none  of hers saved. I think Mary fails  Father & sister Foss then assisted me  to Pack up such things of Mothers as was  designed for Phebe one of the dresses that  Phebe wanted fell to Sister Foss which  she sent to Phebe for which she wants  Phebe to write back for her to have her  part of the crockery that is left. I  slept in there east chamber through the     
 night for the last time I bid farewell to  Fabyan And Rhoda And Mary And the  children Also John Fabyan And Mary And   All that family I then in company with  Sister Foss rode through the lane blocked  up with snow on each side on to her house  And Father Carter walked And He got  there first He wanted to stay with  me untill I went so we Packed up all  of little Phebes things And Paid her  Bill which was as follows  65 weeks of Board at 50 cts $32.50  To New clothing for Journey 6.50  to sewing 2.50  $41.50  Paid at sundry times 19.36  Paid cash to balance March 18th 22.14  $41.50      I then took the parting hand with  Phebe And Ira Foss the ownly children  of that family I saw I also took the last  Parting hand And bid farewell to our Hon  Aged Father Carter who seemed much   Affected And wept He sent his best Parental  love to Phebe And wished me to say to her  that he was A full believer in the book of  Mormon And faith of the latter Day Saints  And as soon as he sees his way clear will  endeavor to be baptized spoke of Milton  Holmes calling in the spring to ^be^ baptized him  He was satisfied with our going to Calafornia  And with the course we are persuing  And He wished me to say to Luther   And Rhoda that if they would go with  us He would never complain about it  but thought it best for them to do so I then     
 took little Phebe who was clothed warm  into her Sister Foss slay And in company  with Sister Foss rode to Saco bought Phebe   A pair of shoes and as I had given her  Br Fabyan A new silk Hendkerchief I also  gave sister ^foss^ one that I had with me  I was much interest in my visit with sister  Foss I found her in good faith And a great  desire to gather with us And live with the  saints she carried me to the depo we  there took the parting hand And little  Phebe And myself started on the rail  road after riding a while Phebe looks  around and says whare is my Mother I asked  her which one she said the one that  come with you & I Told her she had  gone back she said that was to bad  to leave her alone but she seemed to  enjoy the journey well to Boston though  she fell asleep And had a long nap on  the Arival of the cars I called upon Br S.

At the  edge of the evening I repaired to the Temple  And dressed in our Priestly robes in company  with Elder Orson Hyde And about 20   others of the Nobility ^Elders^ of Israel we dedicated   the Temple of the Lord built by the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day   Saints, unto His Most Holy name we had   an interesting time, Notwithstanding  the many fals Prophesies of Sidney Rigdon  And others that the roof should not go  on nor the House be finished And the   threats of the mob that we should not   dedicate it yet we have done both And   we had An interesting time At the close  of the dedication we raised our voices     
 in the united shout of Hosanna to God And  the L[a]mb which entered the Heavens to  the joy And consolation of our hearts   we prayed for the camp of Israel, for good  weather that we might not be disturbed  by any mob untill the dedication was over  I returned home thankful for the privilege  of assisting in the dedication of the Temple  of the Lord      May 1, 1846 ~ Friday      May 1st 1846 We met for A public   dedication of the Temple this Morning  Enterance was $1 each to pay the Hands  that had worked on the Temple I Paid $7 for  7 tickets My company consisted this morning  of myself, wife, Father, Mother, one cousin  And Mary Jackson At the hour Apointed   I opened the Meeting by Prayer was followed  in remarks by Br Hyde who also offered  up the dedication Prayer After which Elder   Almon Babit was called upon to Address the  meeting which he did do to the edefycation  of the saints     
 May 2, 1846 ~ Saturday      2nd I spent the day in doing business in the  city [FIGURE]      May 3, 1846 ~ Sunday      3rd May Sunday the saints began to  gather at the Temple at an early hour And  by ten oclock the House was filled to a great  extent. My wife, Father, Mother, cousin &  others took A seat in front of the Melchez  idec Priesthood I occupied the uper stand   in company with Br Hyde & Stratton. After  singing Elder J A Stratton opened the meet-  ing by Prayer. After which Elder Orson  Hyde Arose And Addressed the Assembly from  the following words. "what is man that thou   art mindful of him or the sun of man that  thou visits him" My object says the speaker  is to inquire what kind of A being man is.  Man is As Eternal as God himself And is  Just As much in Eternity now as he ever will  be after Death, the period called time is  ownly one portion of Eternity the same as  the outer wall of A building incloses many  rooms within or As the months Days, Hours  minutes or seconds in a year while in any portion  of them we are in the year still, while we exhist  before the world was, or in the flesh or after   Death, it is all in eternity. The world opposes  the principle of Revelation And does not  wish man to obtain knowledge in that way, but  what Earthly Father that feels interested in   the welfare of his children but what desires  to teach his children & reveal to them   the knowledge He possesses And would  feel interested in there Advancement  so with the Lord He gives gifts & knowledge     
 to his children, and the more intelligence  men get the more refined are there feelings  the knowledge is great & so was his sympathy  in giving his Son Jesus Christ to save man  The world may oppose Revelation but God does  not. we have recieved Revelation & visions  & God hath shown us many things it is true  these blessings have cost us great sacrafizes  we have been oppressed all the day long And at  last are now driven to the wilderness, but  we will go & not stay with the world, And  when we go we remove the candle light  from there midst And take it to the sons   of Nature who have not shed the blood of  Prophets. I will leave my testimony with  you, though it should be like A Harpoon.  As respects the finishing of this house I will ask  why have we laboured to complete it when  we were not expecting to stay. there is two  sides to every thing but Mormonism as to that  there is but one side on earth the other is in   Heaven. If we moved forward & finished  this House we should be recieved a& accepted  as A church with our dead but if not we   should be rejected with our dead. these things  have inspired And stimulated us to Action  in the finishing of it which through the  blessing of God we have been enabled to  accomplish And prepared it for dedication   In doing this we have ownly been saved as   it were by the skin of our teeth. The enemy  Prophesyed we should not get the roof on  but we have finished it. And on Thursday   night we met in this temple Arayed in our  white robes & dedicated it unto God And truly     
 An interesting season we enjoyed. I am willing  to live And Die for the cause, you may wish  to know what we have been doing in this  house I will tell you. We have been anointing And ordaining Kings And Priest unto God. I have been Anointed A king & Priest unto God. If any one wishes to kill me for it let them do it We have laboured hard to ordain kings & Priest unto God to reign here on the earth but not now, but I will tell you when it will be.  when the LORD JESUS CHRIST comes to  reign and recieve his Crown And sit upon   his Throne, The Twelve Apostles will sit  upon there Thrones & Judge the Twelve tribes  of Israel then is the time we expect to recieve  our crown And inherit this earth. We look  forward for A new Heaven & earth but it will  be the old concern made gloriously And renewed  those who have been ordained unto this   office will be born at the resurrection in the  royal linage. If this religion Gospel & Priest-  hood has not power to bind on earth and in  heaven, it is good for nothing when A man  has recieved this gospel Anointing And endow-  ments let him go to the dust but He will   arise And take his place on his throne, then  will the Nations serve And obey us. They are  now Persecuting us And there Persecutions   are bringing gray hairs upon the Saints but   the Heads of the persecutors will be covered  with blackness. Men may have been ordained  from before the foundation of the world to have  performed certain works, there are different  stations in the next world And men will   be delt with here according to the deeds  done in the body A man ought to be good     
 Here as he grows older. A man that does  his duty And obtaines the Priesthood and  honors it will have his reward. His exhaltation  thrones & dominions according to his faithful-  ness. we like our Master have desended  below all things so shall we arise above all  things I have seen this by vision we shall  be connected with the kingdom of Jesus  Christ. To the vary place And station will  A man arise in the resurrection to which He  Has been sealed & anointed on earth  It is said that God will judge the world  so will the saints. On earth Presidents & Govornor  do not Judge, but Judges apointed for the purpose  so in Heaven we shall judge the world Holding  the keys of the kingdom And will rise in  judgment against our enemies who are heaping  there persecutions upon our heads, so with the  Ancient Twelve they will judge Israel for they   brought evil upon them I see the thousands  of poor saints going out to the wilderness in there  oppressions drove out by wicked men, such  men I will not bless but testify against them  they may kill me but I will speak my mind   that man that has the Priesthood and  honors it, is God Himself as much as  Moses was to the People we are sons of God  And Saviors on Mt Zion. If ye are the sons  of God ye shall have all things. He that  over cometh shall inherit all things, sit down  upon my throne &c. The Lord owns all  the Thrones & will give us some. A man in  the Priesthood has persons sealed to him   in his kingdom And is subject to him in the     
 dominions of God worlds And dominions are   continually being formed which adds to the   glory of God. Blessed is he who escapes the   second death, evry saint has A guardian   Angel with him so death cannot kill him   the Angels accompanied the Ancients so they   do us. The Angels of the waters & there   was 4 on the cornors of the earth. when   the guardian Angel is called away we are   left to grapple with death. So with Jesus   He said my God, my God, why hast thou   forsaken me. In three days the Angel   returned rolled back the stone And raised   the Lord the Angels will [not] stay away forever   but will all come with Jesus Christ to raise   all the bodies every man in his own order  this is the way the resurrection is brought   about. Jesus Christ was slain And buried yet   Arose, assended on high And was crowned   Lord of all so with the Prophets martered   in Carthage Jail they must come forth   And be crowned And sit upon there thrones   And Judge there persecutors If ye were   of the world the world would love its own   but because I have chosen you out of the   world there fore they hate you, but they must   be judged of you at last. Man is destined   to occupy A great place to increase in dominion   And Power And this is the secret spring of our   Action. I have A word of caution to all for   one I feel to resign my citizenship because   I cannot enjoy it. I would Advise all the saints   that they cast not another vote in this state   but resign all offices that they hold And all   our friends to do the same I do not say they   shall do it but advise them to. There is a     
 foundation in this that may serve us in days   to come As our father And Mother or the   Nation that has bourn us has rejected us   And driven us out there is A National   calamity At the door. All things are not   known at once, this Temple was built   for A certain purpose that is gained will   we now sell, A vote was taken last fall not   to sell it, but A key that will not open  a door And shut it again is not A good one   so if we have to sell the Temple to   remove the Poor the People that make   us do it must pay the bill & meet the   consequences. All who are in favor of   selling this House if it meets with the council   of the Twelve manifest it by raising the right   hand it was A unanimous vote save one   Elder Hyde closed his remarks and was followed   by Elder W. Woodruff      who backed up the testimony of Elder Hyde   And in speaking of the martydom of the   Smiths said they would rise in Judgment   against Against this Nation, the state of Illinois   Hancock ^Co^ And esspecially Carthage And the   murderers it contains, they are the most   suitable persons to rise in judgment against  them, for they were martered by them  yes the mob of Hancock Co had not yet   got through with Joseph Smith for He was   in the Presence of God and the Lamb in   company with Abram Isaac & Jacob And was   our senator in the Court of Heaven And would   plead our cause And his own And knowing   the cause to be a just will do sumthing   that will have effect     
 The saints had laboured faithfully & finished   the Temple & were now recieved as A church   with our dead this is glory enough for building   the Temple And thousands of the Saints   have recieved there endowment in it And   the light will not go out many other remar-  ks were made by Elder Woodruff when   the meeting & dedication of the Temple   closed.      May 4, 1846 ~ Monday      4th I spent the day ^morning^ in the city vary busy   getting ready to go about 30 miles into the country   to visit Br & Sister Scammans I started with   my mules & carriage & got 4 miles out of the   city & got stalled in a mud hole & had to get   oxen to draw us out I then returned home   covered with mud & gave it up for a bad   Job spent the remainder of the day cleaning   the Mules & Harness &c      May 5, 1846 ~ Tuesday to May 6, 1846 ~ Wednesday      5th & 6 I spent making preperations for   the Journey      May 7, 1846 ~ Thursday      7th I had an interview with Elder Taylor   who called to the returned to the city to   settle his private business      May 8, 1846 ~ Friday      8th I went over the river to the camp      May 9, 1846 ~ Saturday      9th Our company from the east arived   at night with our baggage      May 10, 1846 ~ Sunday      [FIGURES]  10th Sunday I wrote A letter to Mr Roe at   Farmington I recieved 3 letters one from   Br E.

Meeting opened by prayer  by O Pratt who arose we have often been   taught to listen to council given from the head  I do not consider it necessary to treat to day  upon the first principles of the gospel as those  things are understood by you as well as by me. I  have thought of treating upon scientific Principles  there is no truth but what comes from God, it  requires a portion of the spirit of God to know     
 what portion of truth to lay before the people  some classes adore the book of nature & deny  a God, others Profess to adore God and are afraid  to contemplat Natural things but evry truth   should be acknowledged as from God a variety  is interesting & not always remain in one channel  one of the most interesting feasts I ever enjoyed   was in contemplating the worlds and laws by  which they are governed. Men should be learned   in order to convince the learned for instans  a man rises up & says I will not believe a  thing that I cannot comprehend by one   of my 5 senses but the learned man knows   that many truths come by reflection thinking  & s & not by seeing feeling hearing eating   & drinking & again an Elder may tell a con-  gregation that matter is an eternal principle and  exhisted before God made this world they would  not believe it because it comes in contact with there  tradition for they have been taught to believe   from there youth up that God made the Heavens  and earth and all the planetary system in six   days out of nothing. But let that Elder become   acquainted with facts that can be demonstrated  and he can present arguments to that people that  will convince them the more learned the better  as a proof that worlds exhisted before this was formed  or at least more than 7000 years let him present the  demonstrated fact that through the aid of strong glasses  that planets can be seen so far distant that it would   take 24000 years for the light of them to reach  this planet according to asstrinomical calculations  they then must be 24000 years old & just as   likely to have exhisted millions of years before  again as a proof that matter is eternal and that   this earth was formed out of unorganized matter     
 let a man take a good telescope at 4 oclock in a clear  morning & look at the sword in the belt of orion  and he can see unorganized matter enough to make  a Million of Million of Million of worlds each as large   as the sun. A man of wisdon & Judgment can  demonstrate truth for himself independant of all  authors and when he finds a thing is true believe  it though all the world disbelieve it besides & when  he finds a thing fals disbelieve it & renounce it thogh  it be sustained by all Christondon & phylosiphers  and asstronimers of the age. we should esstablish  schools for our children to teach them principle &  truth learning is a good thing a blessing from God &  will prove so to us if we make a right use of [it] but a  bad use would prove a curse. but because some have  made a bad use of learning or even of the Holy Ghost  & power of God as Lucipher in the rebellion of  Heaven does that argue that we should not get  learning or seak for the Holy Ghost certainly not.  there are many hours that both parents & children  squander away that might be spent in learning, but  if our children grow up in ignoranc they with  there posterity would degenerat untill they would be  as ignorant as the savagas that surround us. The Lord  will not do a miracle to give us learning when we can  get it ourselves. Some have an idea that is no matter  about getting knowledge here thinking that by & by  that they will enter heaven & that God will fill there  minds with all the knowledge of the eternal worlds  but they will be mistaken in this for they will have   to learn it little by little as here.      Elder Kimball arose & said it was necessary for this  People to be subject to council. like clay in the hands  of the Potter as to learning there is difference in men  in this thing I spent one winter in learning grammer   and all I did learn about it was the difference betwee  singular & plural number what knowledge I ever did  get God helped me to I desire to love that which is     
 our spirits ought not to stoop to any mean thing &  our bodies ought not to bow down to any wrong thing  & ought not to be defiled but to be used for noble  purposes and as our bodies & spirits are used for good  and good purposes they have no time to do evil but  ascendency is gained over evil & that spirit that has  the power brings forth the fruit of its own work   whether it be good or evil. He said while on this  Journey many said they would do so & so if the  Presidency commanded them so Brigham had to  command them before he could get it done but  we should do good without being commanded to  do it      The Marshall arose & said there were some acts  passed by the City Council which he would mention  that there be no shooting of fire arms after sun down  and no timber cut within 20 miles of here without  the direction of the Council. Also that dogs be  taken care of & to shoot no more dogs without the  order of the Marshall &c      President Young arose & said I wish to say a few  words upon Principle I desire the brethren and   sisters to be taught in all things necessary. There  is one thing I want you to realize and that is   that God, Angels, & Saints Heaven and all of  Gods creation are governed by law and I want  the Camp of Israel to understand that we must  be and if Heaven was not controlled by law what  for a place would it be I would not wish to be   there for were we rushed into Heaven without   law evry man would be in danger of loosing his   rights & having them trampeld upon but all  celestial beings are governed by law & perfect   order yea the celestial law is a perfect order of  things a perfect system of light, law, intelligence  exhaltation & glory where evry persons rights are  sustained to the fulest extent     
 but we do not arive at this knowledge at once, but  as an Apostle said we have precept upon precept,  line upon line, here a little and there a little, untill  we arive at a fulness of knowledge & glory even  that fulness that reigns in the Heavens. we  must begin to be governd by law here before we  are prepared to recieve those blessings. the whole  law has not been given & you cannot abide the whole  law as yet. if it had all been given, we should   have been smashed up & destroyed a people  must become acquainted thoroughly with law before  they can abide it but the time has come when  we must have law oand order in our midst.  There has been some feelings of late in the  camp because some unruly boys have been floged  by the Marshall for thiere wickedness, but if  this camp is not willing to let law & order reign   here & put a stop to such wickedness I wish   you to let me know it & I will go away from   you for those that wish to sustain crime & corrup-  tion let them return & strike hands with the  mob & carry out there principles & be damm-  ed. but if you want to do right say so, this people  have been driven here for there desires to do  righteousness. And this wickedness shall be  put a stop to that has been manifest in the  camp by certain young people of late yes it will  be stoped if God come out & smites it by  Judgment. The Marshall did not whip  them hard enough, if he had they  would not have spit out there revenge  but it would have been whiped out of  them. If I am drove to the necessit of  whipping a person in such a case they will  not spit out revenge afterwards for I will  whip it out of them. Shall we any longer   sustain in our midst men that will carry   out the principles of John C Bennet and     
 other corrupt scoundrils no I will sware   by the Eternal God of Heaven shuch conduct   shall be stoped & shall not be permitted in   this camp for if they continue it I will   tell the Marshall what they the law is & they   shall be taken care of in a manner that   they will not whine and I will whip any   man that will sustain it for those that will   sustain it shall be whiped. And I prophecy   in the name of God such a man whether   old or young shall be bowed down with   sorrow & morning even more than this people   have. then stop before you further go &   not sport upon the brink of sorrow & morning  This people have the Law of Liberty & the   gospel & the more the light & liberty & greater   the privileges the stricter the Law. we are   going into the wilderness & shall we suffer such   things no I swear by the Eternal God such   things shall not be while brigham lives.   Br Kimball gave a good shot when he   said no man run into his waggon & swore   he would shut the Marshall if he come   after him except he was guilty of crime   no man is afraid except he is guilty. No   man need be afraid that does right. I defy   the world to say I have taken any mans right   but after we have been driven into the wilderness   we are still followed by men who sware they   will steal what they have in our midst, I sware   they shall not have it in our midst. Some   young Elders that never preached a sermon   in their lives are afraid that I shall have   more blessings than they, or more wives or   sumthing or other but let them go & preach   the world over as I have done in poverty     
 and distress with blood in my shoes & spent   years & years at it & left my wife & children   who have also suffered much. let them do as   we have done & they will not be jealous of   me about blessings. If the Lord should give   me a thousand women is it any mans business   No. Let such go and spend as much time as   I have and there will be many clinging on to   there skirts to be saved. the majority of the   men of the gentile world will be damned and   the women wish to be saved by going with good   men. And a woman that has the spirit of God   will go with a good man who has been with  faithful & spent much of his time in saveing   mankind and has the priest hood such men   if they continue faithful will be saved in eternal   glory & those that are with him. I an determined   that my affections shall be with God, I will   not allow them to be placed on things that   perish when plagues & diseases get hold of our   bodies we become loathsome & beauty fades away   but our affections should be placed upon things   that are noble exhalted lasting & glorious I love   an exhalted mind for it is eternal & cannot fade  I want all my affections to be subject to God   and glory & eternal life. May God bless you amen      September 14, 1846 ~ Monday      14th Monday I spent the day in laying out a city   for the winters encampment      September 15, 1846 ~ Tuesday      15th In company with Father Woodruff & John   Fowler and my family I started with my   carriage & mules for a ride we rode 4 miles to   the general hayfield I crossed the table land   to the buff there left the family & carriage   & we mounted our horses & rode about 2 miles   to a lake about 2 miles in length & 1/4 mile wide     
 It was surrounded by high grass, weeds, & peavine   the surface of the lake was dotted over with a   great variety of ducks young & old geese brant &c.   I shot 6 ducks & got 4 of them by waiding into   the lake after them I waided for near a mile   in the lake & weeds lost one of my shoes & had   to travel bare foot Br Fowler was taken sick   and in travelling through the high weed's, grass   mud & water back to the place of begining I   was exeeding weary, but before returning home   I took my salmon rod & line & spent a few   moments in trying to ketch fish but could not   start any, we then mounted our mules & returned   to our carriage, took the family & returned to the   camp wet cold and hungry changed my cloths  & retired to rest. 10      September 16, 1846 ~ Wednesday      16th A hard rainy day Br Shirtliff called upon   me in the morning he had returned from the   Punka village to get goods of Sarpee to go out   on a hunting tour with the Punka & Sioux Indians  he said they had been vary kind to them  I attended council in the afternoon. went   on to the ground in the evening to pick out a   lot. went at night to look up the cows   in the dark got lost in the river bottom  could not find the bridge to cross the stream   for a length of time at last I got home about   10 oclok was most sick through the night      September 17, 1846 ~ Thursday      17th Arose quit unwell in the morning I rode  with councillors B. Young H. C. Kimball &   A. Cutler to the river bottom whare they are   cutting hay, we found good land for farming   purposes. I was quite unwell most of the day.   I attended [blank] 12 miles     
 September 18, 1846 ~ Friday      18th I went in company with the Twelve &   others to the Mo river on a piece of table land   to lay out the city or place for the encampment   we abandoned the prairie ridges where we   first laid out the place for the encampment   in consequence of the block winds, we held   a council with the H. Council they spoke there   feelings were divided to a tie about there   place of location President Young spoke his   feelings about it & called for a vote to have   the lot located on the table land near the Mo   river & it was a universal vote. we examined   the ground it was a vary windy day. 10 mile      September 19, 1846 ~ Saturday      19th Saturday a vary windy day, early in the   morning I was on the ground for the city   plot in company with the Twelve & others. Br   Young was the chief surveyer of the plot   we laid of[f] lots sufficient to settle about   150 families. we set some hooks & cot some   cat fish & returned home. 10 mile  I met in council in the evening with the   Twelve & H. Council. & several items of business   was attended to. At the close I conversed   with Br Young & others abut a report that had  reached our ears that the Marshall of the State   of Missouri was on his way with a Posse to take the   Twelve with some kind of a warrant O Missouri   when will thou scease seeking for the blood of the   Twelve Apostles and the Saints of God. there   were 12 horses deposited on an Island oposite of us   draggoon horses completely mounted for riders  capapie were put on by three men what the   intention was we could not tell but such   movements was watching     
 September 20, 1846 ~ Sunday      20th Sunday I met at the stand withe saints  B. Young, Kimball, O Pratt & Woodruff of the   Twelve were present. Meeting opened by prayer by   the President. H C. Kimball made a few remarks  said he had no time to be sick he had so much   to do. If he lay down to be sick he would be   called up so soon that he had no time to be sick   & made remarks upon a variety of things      President Young followed & said he could   soon answer his mind did not fell [feel] much   like preaching had to administer to the sick   brethren [who] are labouring hard to keep soul and   body together when I see the suffering that   this people are enduring from the conduct   of professed Christians I feel more like   fighting & swearing than preaching for I see   such strugling to live that I have feelings   for the brethren to see them suffer for their religion  I am glad I have not power for I should   use it. when I have I shall have knowledge   to use it. offenses must come but wo unto those   by wholm they come. we are followed by wicked   men who will lie about us & run to Missouri &   say we are triying to kill them &c I hope such   will go away & fall & die. Some are whineing   because we will not strike hands with the devil  I wish they knew right from wrong. the High   Council are appointed to do business for the Church  will they not do right yes they will regulate the   affairs of cutting timber and all affairs for the   benefit of the people. Some act selfish but I   want to act for the good of all, because all things   do not go to suit the convenienc of all some   want to run to Mo but I want to let Mo alone     
 for they will rot in their own corruption   and burn up but if any man wants to go &   join the mob I hope he will get marked so as   to stay marked untill the resurrection, other   remarks were made & meeting dismissed      September 21, 1846 ~ Monday      21st I spent a hard days work in stakeing   out our new city or location      September 22, 1846 ~ Tuesday      22nd A report reached us that a mob or   company of armed men were coming toward   us from Missouri on the west side of the   river. we called the men together in the encamp  ment & organized them into a legion Brigham   Young occupied his former place as Major   General of the Legion Mr Stephen Markham   appointed Collonel, Hosea Stout 1st Major   Mr [blank] Scott 2nd Major [blank lines]  And officers to fill   out the legion, the whole numbering about   500 men including three companies of artillery   men of 25 each the day was mostly spent in   this way all were well armed and equiped   for self defence      September 23, 1846 ~ Wednesday      23rd We removed our encampment this day   from the prairie ridge to the table land on the   bank of the Missouri River which was a   beautiful place for a city the city was laid out   in blocks of 20 rods by 40 each lot 4 by 10.   I had one block for my company which   consisted of near 40 families so I had to   put about 2 families on a block. It was a vary   busy day we had no yard so we lost many of our   cattle at night     
 September 24, 1846 ~ Thursday      24th I hunted cattle all day most of the division   drew poles & made fence to keep the cattle      September 25, 1846 ~ Friday      25th Square  Wells arived in camp also Br   Cutler direct from Nauvoo I sat about one hour   and herd them relate the state of affairs in that   city the mob of Hancock county & the State of   Illinois had swollen to about 1000 men had   come upon Nauvoo & 100 of the Saints had kept   them off 3 days then had a pitched battle of  one hour 20 minutes & drove the mob of[f] the   ground with the loss of three of the Saints &   how many of the mob was not known by us   but as Br Wells will give a public statement   I shall write it more full. I spent the day   hunting cattle and lost my mule saddle bridle   and 2 ducks I had killed I got wet & had to   walk home. 15 miles      September 26, 1846 ~ Saturday      26th Saturday I found my mule this morning  saddle & ducks all right I spent the day hunting   cattle & exploring the country I found all our   cattle. And traveld a long distance up & down   the river. I also got wet feet to day halling   several cattle out of the mud to save life. I travled   during the day. 30 miles      In the evening a drove of wolves caught a calf   that bauled at a dreadful rate untill he was   dead it was heard over the encampment I   was with B Young Kimball & Richard of the 12   untill midnight in council & retired to rest      September 27, 1846 ~ Sunday      27 Sunday I spent the morning hearing a paper   from Missouri read giving an account of the   battle between the mob & mormons of Nauvoo  Also of General Karney army of the west     
 among wholm was 50 of the Mormons  there was a prospect of the whole armey  suffering for want of food. We appointed  a meeting at 2 oclok in our new city to  hear a statement made by square wells of  the affairs in Nauvoo before meeting the cry  of fire was heard on the prairie grass of  the encampment & all run to put it out &  it was soon extinguished.      Meeting opened at 2 oclok PM at the Council  Block. Meeting opened by prayer by O. Pratt  who also remarked that we had suffered  by the gentiles a long time; but had now gone  out of there midst & hoped we should rest  for a season from there grasp. had rather  suffer the fatigues of this wilderness journey  and live on game than suffer by mobs. would  rather fall into the hands of God than a mob  as God is more merciful. I have heard the  prophet say that God could not controle the  wicked at all times and let them act upon  their agency without operating upon them as  a machine. I am contented whare I am  but should be more so if we had an abundanc  of the necessaries of life, the mob at last   have had courage after gathering & threatning   for about 6 years to come against the Saints  in Nauvoo from one thousand to twelve hundred  men had came against one hundred of the  Saints and have a pitched battle, but the Saints  went out to battle in the name of God & their ene-  mies were defeated.      Daniel H Wells arose and said, I will by request  give a short account of affairs in Nauvoo concerning  their late difficulties. You have heard that  men were lynched there. we took 15 of the     
 of the offenders who were sent to Quincy for  a trial were let out on bail, the mob then  issued writs against Picket, Clifford & Furnice  the two latter went Picket would not a mob   was then raised as a possee to execute the   writs they said. they staid several weeks to  increas there numbers they had at first  about 300. ^and increased to 1000^ the 100 men we had lay in  ambush for the mob they canonaded through  the day but done no harm. Next day they  tried the same again we repelled them. On  Saturday at one oclok they advanced upon the  city with 1000 or 12000 men we met them   in the name of God and gained the victory  the action lasted one hour & 20 minutes they  fired 42 cannon ball & we 32 ball though  the mob were 10 to our one they were defeated &  retreated from the battle field we had three  killed and none wounded. the mob would   not acknowledge any killed but we walked  ove[r] the battle ground & found a plenty of  mob blood. One man not a member of  the Church said he saw them put 15 bodies  in one waggon that were handled like dead  & other waggons were loaded in the same  way. one of the Saints lying in a suller saw  8 wounded brought to the building each one  telling whare he was shot, they dug at there  intrenchment after the battle it was supposed  they buried there dead there. the next day   was sunday they did not shute any we flung  some ball & burst one cannon on Monday  the mob sent us a cannon ball to let us know  they had some left & we sent it back agan   during the fight the boys would watch the  cannon ball strike & run & get it & bring it  to us & we would send it back. On  Tuesday a committee was sent to us     
 to make a treaty but it was rejected by both  parties a brigade was then called for, but  afterwards a treaty was made. we agreed  to surrender the city & leave in 5 days  On wednesday evening the treaty was made  and the Saints bgan to pack up their goods  and the next day all goods was removed  as the mob came in we left 2 blocks in  advance. we met many of the Saints on  this side of the river in distress & it drew  tears from the eyes of some of the mob  We saw camp fires of the mob the same  night we left on both sid[e]s of the river  There were scenes transpired in the siege enough  to melt the heart of a stone, the lynching of men  when they are labouring for a living & whiping them  untill they cannot stand alone as the mob did  was a damnable thing they made them kneel  on a spot whare they said some one was buried  placed them in a position so they could be whiped  easy an old revolutioner was one of them and   was so beat by the mob that he has not been  able to get about all summer. I have an old  grand Father, a Revolutioner I have thought I  would not let him know any thing about it  but keep it from him that his feelings may  not be harrow up as he is about ready to step  into his grave. But I will say no more but  give way for Father ^Br^ Cutler    Br Cutler arose and said I can bear my testim-  ony that what Br Wells has said is strictly true  according to the best of my knowledge. If I was  to talk untill sun down the whole could not   be told. I have been kept in Nauvoo by the hand  of God others wanted to have been here and  would have been had it not been necessary to  have stoped to save our brethren there who could     
 not get away. I know the hand of God has been  made manifest in the salvation of the people in  Nauvoo I thank God I had a hand in the battle  and the hand of God was so visible in that   battle that many that were weak & faltering have  been much strengthend by it and will gather  with the saints. I did not expect that God   would deliver their enemies into their hands but  expected that God would save them out of the   hands of their enemies and this he has done  I was sensible we must leave Nauvoo the time has  come for us to depart God has called upon us to  go and if we will not he will let the mob loose  upon us to drive us out, but they will not   get any glory for it but will have to suffer  for their wrongs to the. I hope the day will  come when we shall not have to suffer from  Mobs as we have done. But if we had sought   to have saved our lives in this case by fleeing  many would have lost them for but few   could have fled. But we went out in the  name of God and conquered through the  blessings of God we done well. one brother  put on a sheep bell and went near the camp to spy  out the enemy and they supposed it to be a   sheep. The mob do not acknowledge they  had any killed dut they had a good deal of  blood spilled which they could not cover   up which I saw. Capt Smith who was Capt  of the guard at the time of the death of  Joseph was shot in the neck but not killed another   commander was also shot, we have done the  best we could, to kill the poor Devels and we  are satisfyed with the result and leave it all  in the hands of God. Br Wells has done well     
 in all places where he has been put, in the midst of  danger, as well as safety. with regard to the citizens  of Nauvoo there were but few who stood by us  in time of trouble there are many spirits in Nauvoo   that are like bats ready to join any party that   conquer if the beast conquer they will show ther  legs if the featherd tribe there wings. we left  the mob in the city hoping that the time  would come when we could gain a greater  victory over them.      President Young arose and said I wish to make  a few remarks attached to the remarks that  have been made. I will inform the brethren  that have come up we are glad to see them. Br  Cutler has been with us before. Br Wells has  been in our society for several years and I  have had considerable acquaintance with him   and I am more than ever satisfyed with his   course. we have prayed for our brethren con-  tinually I am sensible there is a good deal of   suffering there and here, but let me say the Lord   God who has fed us all the day long, has his care still  over us, when the Saints are chastened enough  it will scease at least the hand of God will be  visible in there salvation, some individuals  may fall but the body will be sustained I  have never believed the Lord would suffer  a general Massacrce of this people by a mob. If  10,000 men were to come against us if  no other way was open the earth would open  and swallow them up some say they can   stay in Nauvoo and can live there in perfet  peace they are so righteous, there are some  that have no better eyes than to say let me live  with the wicked in peace but there blessings   will be scearce with the mob, and if they   do not leave I fear they will prove a scourge     
 in the hands of God. He works with the wicked  by law and when they trespass upon his  rights God is there to maintain them. Many  other remarks were made by President  Young when meeting was dismissed one   hour during the intermission Elders I  visited the sick council met in the aftern  oon and attended to some business on hand      September 28, 1846 ~ Monday      28th I went over the river & took a ramble  for house logs & some of the company dug  out a canoe. 12      September 29, 1846 ~ Tuesday      29th I went up the river on the west side  in company with several others I cut 100  house logs and returned home vary weary   14 m      September 30, 1846 ~ Wednesday      30th I went up the river to day & cut   about 100 house logs within about 2 miles   of the camp. 4      October 1, 1846 ~ Thursday      Oct 1st I was nearly sick and confined  to my bed in consequence of hard labour      October 2, 1846 ~ Friday      2ndnd I spent apart of the day in council      October 3, 1846 ~ Saturday      3rd I spent this day in council & the evening      October 4, 1846 ~ Sunday      4th Sunday O Pratt deliverd a sermon  on the first principle of the gospel had an  intermission one hour. During this time  O Pratt, A Lyman and W. Woodruff laid  out the city of the camp of Israel named  Winter Quarters into thirteen wards and  appointed a Bishop over each ward we ordained     
 six of the Bishops. There was a council  in the evening to transact such business as  was necessary      October 5, 1846 ~ Monday      5th I prepared myself this morning for a graping  expedition I harnessed my horses into my  carriage & took into it 5 women to pick   grapes & rode to the new ferry crossed from  thence went to Council point. shot 3 prai-  rie chickens on the way called upon Br J.

He and square  Picket brought a large number of exchange papers  containing the news from various parts of the  United States we herd ait rumoured that Br  R Hedlock had borrowed $7000 dollars on  the credit of the Church and fled to parts  Unknown. many things were talked over during  the council.

 the Twelve, High Council and Bishops   meet each week to do business and   to carry business teaching & instruct-  ions to the Saints in each ward. There   is begining to be murmerings through   the camp and much wickedness that   the Lord is not pleased with the Saints  appear at the presant time some as the  children of Israel did while in the wilde-  rness & the Nephites on this continant   at times they would forget their God   and turn to wickedness. And while in  council this evening the High Council   asked President Young for some teaching  He arose and said he had no teaching   to give at present but to cry repentance to   to the people. And he would begin with  the High Council they must repent and   the camp of Israel must repent or it   would not be long before a man could   not bear the priesthood upon his head in  there midst and the Twelve would   have to flee out of there midst and   go to the mountains which would   be a great curse to this people H C Kimball   arose and related a dream said he   was travelling with President Young   vary fast and they thought they could   fly and they flew through the air   and lit down upon a large plain   and they saw it coverd with large   groups of snakes and they had to   jump from place to place to get over   them but they lay still while they   were in there midst Brother Young
