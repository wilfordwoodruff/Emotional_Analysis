When we came here  our position demanded that the very  first thing we did was to plant our  potatoes and sow our wheat, or we  had starvation before us; and I will  here say that the Saints and the El- ders of Israel have gone before the  Lord day after day and week after  week, and prayed the Almighty to  hide up the treasures of these moun- tains, lest even the Latter-day Saints,  with all the faith they had, should be  tempted to turn away from the culti- vation of the earth and the manu- facture of what they needed; and the  Lord heard our prayers, and we  dwelt here many years and filled  these valleys for six hundred miles with cities, towns, villages, gardens, orchards, fields, vineyards, hundreds  of school-houses, and places of wor- ship, until we made the desert blos- som as the rose, and had a supply of  wheat, bread and clothing upon our  hands. Then, I do not know but the  Elders ceased praying for the Lord  to hide up the treasures of the earth   I guess they did, for very soon  after mines began to be opened, and  now silver mines are being worked in  many parts of the Territory. A few years ago General Connor and others,  who dwelt here, with soldiers under  them, spent very many days in  prospecting these mountains from one  end to the other for gold and silver, but they could find none; to-day you  may go over the same places, and if  you dig into the earth you may find  plenty of silver, and you may find it  almost anywhere in these mountains. I suppose this is all right, I have no  fault to find with it; but I still say  that the interest of the Latter-day  Saints in these mountains is to culti- vate the soil and to manufacture what  [t]hey use.  Through the influence of President  Young we have many manufactories  for wool and cotton already estab- lished in this Territory.  He has  done more than any man living in  these last days, according to the  means he has had at his command,  to establish these branches of busi- ness in the midst of these mountains. We have now many large factories in  this Territory that have to stand still for want of wool. I want to say a  few words on this subject to the wool  growers of Deseret.  Instead of  sending our wool out of the Territory,  to eastern States to be manufactured  into cloth, and purchasing it and  paying eastern manufacturers a large  per centage for it when brought here  by railroad, I feel that it is our duty,  and it would be far wiser for us, to  sell our wool to those who own fac- tories in this Territory, and to sustain  ourselves by sustaining home manu- factures.  One of the first commands given  to Adam, after being placed in Eden, was to dress the garden; and he was  permitted to eat of the fruit of every  tree except one.  After a while Adam and his wife, Eve, partook of the  fruit of this tree, and the history of  the Fall is before us and the world. After Adam was cast out of the gar- den the Lord told him that there  should be a curse on the earth, and  instead of bringing forth beautiful  flowers, fruit and grain spontaneously,  as before the Fall, it should bring  forth thorns, briers, thistles and  noxious weeds, and that man should earn his bread by the sweat of his  brow; and from that time to the  present mankind has had this curse to contend with in the cultivation of  the earth. In consequence of this  the inhabitants of Utah, in their agricultural operations have to fight  against the cockle burr, the black  seed and sunflower, as well as thorns 
 COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE LATTER-DAY WORK.  79  and thistles and many other noxious  weeds, which, if not eradicated,  speedily take advantage of us, and  to a great extent, mar the result of  our labors. It will pay us to pay  attention to these things; it will pay  us to dress the earth, to till it, to  take care of and spend time and  means in manuring and feeding it;  it will pay us to gather out these  noxious weeds, for the earth will then  have a chance to bring forth in its  strength. This, with the blessing of  God upon our labors, has made the  soil of Utah as productive as it is  to-day.  I wish to see this interest  increase in our midst; and I hope, in  addition to this, that those who are  raising sheep our wool growers   will pay attention to and carry on  that branch of business systemati- cally, and that we will sell our wool  to those who manufacture it at home,  instead of sending it out of the  Territory to be manufactured. I feel  that this is our duty, and the course  which will promote our best interests, and it is a principle which is true,  independent of religion, in any com- munity or nation; it is a self-sus- taining principle.  God has blessed us, he has blessed  the earth, and our labors in the tilling  of the soil have been greatly pros- pered. As has been said by some of  our brethren in their remarks, when  the pioneers came here, no mark of  civilization or of the white man, was found. If those who are now so  anxious to obtain the homes we have  made, had seen Utah as we saw it, they would never have desired a  habitation here, but they would have  got out of it as soon as they could. It was barren, desolate, abounding  with grasshoppers, crickets and kiote wolves, and these things seemed to  be the only natural production of the soil. We went to work by faith, not much by sight, to cultivate the  earth. We broke almost all the  plows we had the first day. We had  to let streams of water out to moisten the earth, and by experience we had  to learn to raise anything. The  stranger comes into Salt Lake City and sees our orchards, and the trees in our streets, and he thinks, what a  fruitful and delightful place it is. He does not think that, for twenty  or twenty-four years, almost every  tree he beholds, according to its age, has had to be watered twice a week through the whole summer season, or  they would all have been dead long  since. We have had to unite upon  these things, the Lord has blessed  our labors, and his mercies have been  over this people.  If we had not cultivated the earth,  but had turned our attention to min- ing, we should not only have starved to death ourselves, but thousands of  strangers, who have passed through,  would have shared the same fate. Utah Territory has been the great  highway to California, Nevada, and  all the western States and Territories, and they have all looked, in a mea- sure, to Utah for their bread. No- body but Latter-day Saints would  have lived here, and endured the  trials and affllictions that we endured  in the beginning; none others would  have stayed and fought the crickets  one year, as we had to do year after  year. Any people but the Latter- day Saints would have left this coun- try long ago. Not only so, on  account of the things I have already  named, but I will here say that no  other people could have lived here  no, they would have knocked each  others' brains out on account of the  little water they would have had in  their irrigating operations. When men saw their crops and trees wither- ing and perishing for the want of  water, the selfishness so general in  the world would have worked up to 
 80  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  such an extent, that they would have  killed one another, and hence I say  that none but Latter-day Saints  would have stood it; but they, by  the training and experience they  had before received, were prepared  for the hardships and trials they had  to encounter in this country.  Brethren and sisters, let us con- tinue our efforts in cultivating the  earth, and in the manufacturing what  we want. And I still urge upon  our Female Relief Societies, in this  city and throughout the Territory, to  carry out the counsel President Young gave us years and years ago,  and try, as far as possible, within  ourselves, to make our own bonnets,  hats and clothing, and to let the  beauty of what we wear be the work- manship of our own hands. It is  true that our religion is not in our  coat or bonnet, or it should not be. If a man's religion is there it is  not generally very deep anywhere  else. But God has blessed us with  the products of earth and the bles- sings of heaven, and his Spirit has  been with us; we have been pre- served, and the Lord has turned  away the edge of the sword, and  he has protected us during many  years past and gone, and we all  have to acknowledge his hand in  these things.  I do not wish to detain this Con- ference. I felt as though I wanted  to make a few remarks on these sub- jects. I hope, brethren, that we  will not slacken our hands with  regard to the cultivation of the  earth. In the prosecution of our  labors in that respect we have every- thing to contend with that man has  been cursed with for five thousand  years. We should clean our fields,  as far as we can, of the noxious  weeds, and our streets of sunflowers. These things encumber the earth.   We have one difficulty to contend  with, unknown save in those por- tions of the earth where irrigation  is practiced.  It is true that a man  may clean his fields of sunflowers, cockle burrs, blackseed and every  other noxious weed that grows, and  the very first time he waters his land  here will come a peck or a bushel of  foul seed from the mountains, and  fill every field through which the  stream flows. These difficulties we  have to fight against, but we must  do the best we can. As farmers,  we should clean our seed, and not  sow the foul along with the good. One man, in a few hours, with a  good wire sieve, can sift enough seed  for ten acres of land, and perhaps  for twenty; while, to pull that bad  seed out when grown will cost from  one to five hundred dollars, for it  will take a score of men days to do  it. We should use our time, judg- ment and the wisdom God has  given us to the best advantage in  all these things.  I want the brethren to come toge- ther this afternoon and elect their  officers, for we desire to hold a fair  this fall, in which the agricultural and manufacturing interests of the  Territory may be represented aud  interested. Let us not be weary in  well doing; let us not slacken our  hands, either in cultivating the earth  or in the manufacturing of what we  need. Co-operate in agricultural  and mercantile matters, also in our  tanneries, and in the making of  butter and cheese. One man may  engage in these branches of busi- ness with advantage if he have skill and experience to guide him; but in  co-operation the wisdom of all is  combined for the general good. This plan has been adopted with advantage in other communities, cities, States, Territories and countries, and it can  be in this more extensively than it  has been hitherto. 
 OBSERVE THE SABBATH DAY.  81  I pray that God will bless us, and  bless this whole people; and I pray  that the testimony which we have  received here during this Conference,  which is true, may not be forgotten  by us.  I can bear the same testi- mony.  I know this work is of God. I know Joseph Smith was a Prophet  of God.  I have heard two or three  of the brethren testify about brother  Young in Nauvoo. Every man and  every woman in that assembly, which  perhaps might number thousands,  could bear the same testimony. I  was there, the twelve were there, and a good many others, and all can  bear the same testimony. The ques- tion might be asked, why was the  appearance of Joseph Smith given to  Brigham Young? Because here was  Sidney Rigdon and other men rising  up and claiming to be the leaders of  the Church, and men stood, as it  were, on a pivot, not knowing which  way to turn. But just as quick as  Brigham Young rose in that assem- bly, his face was that of Joseph  Smith the mantle of Joseph had  fallen upon him, the power of God  that was upon Joseph Smith was  upon him, he had the voice of Joseph, and it was the voice of the shepherd. There was not a person in that as- sembly, Rigdon, himself, not ex- cepted, but was satisfied in his own  mind that Brigham was the proper  leader of the people, for he would not have his name presented, by his  own consent, after that sermon was  delivered. There was a reason for  this in the mind of God; it con- vinced the people. They saw and  heard for themselves, and it was by  the power of God.  May God bless you.  May he give  us wisdom to direct us in all things, and promote all the interests of Zion  for Jesus' sake.  Amen. 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.   275  DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF, DELIVERED IN THE 13TH WARD ASSEMBLY ROOMS, SALT LAKE CITY, JANUARY 12, 1873.  (Reported by David W. Evans.)  THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN -- THE SAINTS' DUTIES.  My address this afternoon will be  intended for those who profess to be  Latter-day Saints -- those who have  entered into co[v]enant with the Lord  our God.  I am surrounded with  those who know by experience that  we are dependent upon the influence  and inspiration of the Holy Ghost to  enable us to teach the things of the  kingdom of God.  My faith is that  no man, in this or any other genera- tion, is able to teach and edify the  inhabitants of the earth without the  inspiration of the Spirit of God.  As  a people we have been placed in  positions the last forty years which  have taught, in all our administra- tions and labors, the necessity of  acknowledging the hand of God in  all things.  We feel this necessity  to-day.  I know that I am not quali- fied to teach either the Latter-day  Saints or the world without the  Spirit of God.  I desire this this  afternoon, and also your faith and  prayers, that my mind may be led in  a channel which may be beneficial to  you.  In my public teaching I never  permit my mind to follow in any  channel except that which the Spirit  dictates to me, and this is the posi- tion we all occupy when we meet  with the Saints, or when we go forth  to preach the Gospel.  As Jesus told  his Apostles, Take no thought what  ye shall say, it is told us, Take no thought what we shall say ; but we  treasure up in our minds words of  wisdom by the blessing of God and  studying the best books.  We are told in the 24th chapter  of Matthew that Jesus, on a certain  occasion, taught his disciples many  things concerning his Gospel, the  Temple, the Jews, his second com- ing and the end of the world ; and  they asked him -- Master, what shall  be the sign of these things?  The  Savior answered them, but in a very  brief manner.  As my mind runs a  little in that channel, I feel disposed  to read a portion of the word of the  Lord unto us, which explains this  matter more fully than the Savior  explained it to his disciples.  That  portion of the word of the Lord  which I shall read, is a revelation  given to the Latter-day Saints, March 7, 1831, forty-two years ago  next March.  It commences on the  133rd page of the Book of Doctrine  and Covenants.  -[The speaker read the revelation,  and then resumed his remarks as  follows]- :  I want to ask who are looking for  the fulfillment of these events, and  who upon the earth are preparing  themselves for the fulfillment of the  word of the Lord through the months  of Prophets, Patriarchs and Apostles for the last six thousand years? 
 276   JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  Nobody that I have any knowledge  of, without it is the Latter-day Saints,  and I for one feel that we are not  half so much awake as we ought to  be, and not half as well prepared as  we ought to be for the tremendous  events which are coming upon the  earth in quick succession in these  latter days.  Who can the Lord ex- pect to prepare for his second coming  but his Saints?  None.  Why? Because, as is said in this revelation,  light has come forth to the inhabitants  of the earth, and they have rejected  it, because their deeds are evil.  This message has been proclaimed among  the Christian nations of Europe and  America, and in many other nations, for the past forty years.  Inspired  men -- the Elders of Israel -- have  gone forth without purse or scrip  declaring the Gospel of life and sal- vation to the nations of the world, but they have rejected their testi- mony, and condemnation rests upon  them therefor."  As the Prophet  said, "Darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the minds of the  people."  Who believes in the fulfill- ment of prophecy and revelation? Who, among priests and people to- day, has any faith in the sayings of  Jesus Christ?  If there be any peo- ple besides the Saints whose eyes are  open to the great events which will  soon overtake the nations, I would like to know and visit them.  I  would to God that the eyes of the  Latter-day Saints were open far more  than they are to those things that  rest upon them!  The Lord is look- ing to them alone to build up his Zion here in the mountains of Israel, and to prepare the bride, the Lamb's  wife, for the coming of the Great  Bridegroom.  I believe in the ful- fillment of the revelations which the  Lord has given to us, as much as I  believe that I have a soul to save or  lose, or as much as I believe in the  shining of the sun in the firmament  of heaven.  Why?  Because every  word that God has ever spoken, whe- ther by his own voice out of the hea- vens, by the ministration of angels,  or by the mouths of inspired men, has been fulfilled to the very letter as  far as time has permitted.  We have  fulfilled many of the sayings of the  Prophets of God.  The revelation I  have read this afternoon was given  forty-two years ago.  Has there been  any sound of war since then?  Has  there been any sound of war in our  land since that period?  Has there  been any standard lifted up to the  nations, any gathering together of  the people into these mountains of  Israel from nearly all nations?  There  has [.] We have had a beginning, the  fig tree is leaving, putting forth its  leaves in the sight of all men, and  the signs in both heaven and earth  all indicate the coming of the Lord  Jesus Christ.  When my mind, under the influ- ence of the Spirit of God, is open to  comprehend these things, I many times marvel and wonder, not only  at the world but also at ourselves, that we are not more anxious and  diligent in preparing ourselves and  our families for the events now at  our doors, for though the heavens  and the earth pass away, not one  jot or tittle of the word of the Lord  will go unfulfilled.  There is no pro- phecy of Scripture that is of any  private interpretation, but holy men  of God spake as they were moved  upon by the Holy Ghost, and their  words will be fulfilled on the earth.  We are approaching an important  time.  As Jesus once said, The  world hate me, and without a cause, therefore I have chosen you out of  the world, and the world hate you  also.  The servant is not above his  master, you are not above me, they  have hated me and they will hate 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.  277  you.  The Lord has chosen the Lat- ter-day Saints, and through them  has sent a message to all nations  under heaven.  The Zion of God is  opposed by priest and people in every  sect, party and denomination in  Christendom.  The Elders of Israel  have been called from the plow,  plane, hammer and the various oc-  cupations of life, to go forth and  bear record of these things to the  world.  We have followed this up  until the present time for more than  forty-two years -- forty-three years  next April.  The kingdom has stead- ily grown, and while we have la- bored we have seen the fulfillment  of the word of the Lord.  The sea  has gone beyond its bounds, there  have been earthquakes in divers  places, and there have also been  wars and rumors of wars.  These are  only a beginning, their fullness has  not yet opened upon the sons of  men, but it is at their doors; it is at  the doors of this generation and  of this nation.  And when the  world rise up against the kingdom  of God in these latter days, should the Saints have any fears?  Should we fear because men, in their secret  chambers, concoct plans to over- throw the kingdom of God?  We  should not.  There is one thing we  should do, and that is, pray to God. Every righteous man has done this,  even Jesus the Savior, the Only Be- gotten of the Father in the flesh, had to pray, from the manger to  the cross, all the way through; every  day he had to call upon his Father  to give him grace to sustain him  in his hour of affliction and to enable  him to drink the bitter cup.  So with  his disciples.  They were baptized  with the same baptism that he was  baptized with; they suffered the  same death that he died, being cru- cified as he was.  They sealed their  testimony with their blood.  Never- theless all that Jesus said concerning  the Jews has had its fulfillment to  the present day.  This should be a  strong testimony to the whole infidel  world of the truth of Christ's mission  and divinity.  Let them look at the  Jewish nation and the state of the  world, in fulfillment of the words of  the Savior eighteen hundred years  ago in Jerusalem.  It is one of the  strongest testimonies in the world of  the fulfillment of revelation, the truth  of the Bible and the mission of Jesus  Christ.  The Jews have fulfilled the  words of Moses, the prophets and  Jesus, up to the present day.  They have been dispersed and trampled  under the feet of the Gentile world  now for eighteen hundred years. When Pontius Pilate wished to re- lease Jesus Christ, saying that he  found no fault in that just man, the  high priests, scribes, pharisees and  other Jews present on that occasion  cried, "Crucify him, and let his blood  be upon us and upon our children." [##Matthew 27:22-25##] Has it not followed them to this  day, and been manifest in their dis- persion, persecution and oppression through the whole Gentile world  for eighteen hundred years?  It has. And they have to fulfill the words  of the Lord still further.  As I have  been reading to you to-day, the  Jews have got to gather to their  own land in unbelief.  They will  go and rebuild Jerusalem and their  temple.  They will take their gold and silver from the nations and will  gather to the Holy Land, and when  they have done this and rebuilt their  city, the Gentiles, in fulfillment of  the words of Ezekiel, Jeremiah and  other prophets, will go up against  Jerusalem to battle and to take a  spoil and a prey; and then, when  they have taken one-half of Jeru- salem captive and distressed the  Jews for the last time on the earth,  their Great Deliverer, Shiloh, will

They do not believe in Jesus  of Nazareth now, nor ever will until  he comes and sets his foot on  Mount Olivet and it cleaves in twain,  one part going towards the east, and  the other towards the west.  Then, when they behold the wounds in his  hands and in his feet, they will say, "Where did you get them?"  And  he will reply, "I am Jesus of Naza- reth, King of the Jews, your Shiloh, him whom you crucified."  Then, for  the first time will the eyes of Judah  be opened.  They will remain in un- belief until that day.  This is one of  the events that will transpire in the  latter day.  The Gospel of Christ has to go to  the Gentiles until the Lord says  "enough," until their times are ful- filled, and it will be in this generation.  Forty years have passed since the  revelation I have read was given to  the sons of men.  We are living in  a late age, although it is true there  are a great many vast and important  events to transpire in these days. But one thing is certain, though the  Lord has not revealed the day nor  the hour wherein the Son of Man  shall come, he has pointed out the  generation, and the signs predicted as the fore-runners of that great event  have begun to appear in the heavens  and on the earth, and they will  continue until all is consummated.  If we, as Latter-day Saints, want  anything to stir us up, let us read  the Bible, Book of Mormon and the  Book of Doctrine and Covenants,  they contain enough to edify and instruct us in the things of God. Treasure up the revelations of God  and the Gospel of Christ contained therein.  As an individual, I will say that  I feel a great responsibility resting  upon me, and it also rests upon you. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young  alone have not been called to build  up in the latter day that great and  mighty kingdom of God which Dan- iel foretold, and which he said  should be thrown down no more  for ever.  I say, they were not called  to be the only ones to labor in  building up that great and glorious  Zion, which was to become terrible  to all nations; nor their counselors, nor the Twelve Apostles; but this  responsibility rests upon every one  of the Lord's anointed upon the face  of the earth, I do not care who they  are, whether male or female, and  the Lord will require this at the  hands of all the Latter-day Saints. I therefore desire that we may be  awake to these subjects, and to the  position we occupy before God and in  the world.  The inhabitants of the earth may  hate and oppose us, as they did  Jesus Christ, and as they have all  inspired men, as they did Noah, Enoch, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and all the pro- phets who ever lived.  They have  always been a thorn in the flesh to  the world.  Why?  Because they  had enough independence of mind  to rebuke sin, to maintain the  promises of God unto man, and to  proclaim the declarations of the Al- mighty unto the inhabitants of the  earth, fearless of consequences.  The  last song sung here was, "Do what  is right, let the consequence fol- low."  That is what I say to the  Latter-day Saints.  Let us do what  is right, maintain our religion be- fore God, be valiant in the testimony  of Jesus Christ, and prepare our- selves for his coming, for it is near, and this is what God requires at our  hands.  He leans upon no other  people; he expects from no people  but those who have obeyed his Gos- pel and gathered here, the accom- plishment of his great work, the  building up of his latter-day Zion 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.  279  and kingdom.  And, as I have said,  this responsiblity rests not only upon  Prophets and Apostles, but upon  every man and woman who has en- tered into covenant with him.  I  say that we are too near asleep, we  are not half awake to the position  that we occupy before God, and the  responsibilities we are under to him. We should be on the watch tower.  Who is going to be prepared for  the coming of the Messiah?  These  men who enjoy the Holy Ghost and  live under the inspiration of the Al- mighty, who abide in Jesus Christ  and bring forth fruit to the honor  and glory of God.  No other people  will be.  There never was a more  infidel generation of Christians on  the face of the earth than there is  to-day.  They do not expect that  God will do anything in a temporal  point of view towards the fulfill- ment of his promises; they are not  looking forward for the establish- ment of his kingdom, or for the  building up of his Zion on the earth.   Their eyes are closed to these things, because they have rejected  the light.  When Joseph Smith  brought this Gospel to the world, there was a great deal more faith in  God, a great deal more faith in his  revelations, and, according to the  light they had, a great deal more  pure and undefiled religion than  there is now.  We have carried the  Gospel to all Christian nations who would permit us, and they have  rejected it, and they are under con- demnation.  Our own nation is un- der condemnation on this account. This land, North and South America,  is the land of Zion, it is a choice  land--the land that was given by  promise from old father Jacob to his  grandson and his descendants, the  land on which the Zion of God  should be established in the latter  days.  We have been fulfilling the  prophecies concerning it, for the  last forty years.  We have come up here and established the kingdom; True, it is small to-day, it may be  compared to a mustard seed, but as  the Lord our God lives, the little  one will become a thousand, and  the small one a strong nation, and  the Lord Almighty will hasten it  in his own time, and the world will  learn one thing in this generation,  and that is, that when they fight  against Mount Zion, they fight against  the decrees of the Almighty and the principles of eternal life.  I rejoice before God that I have  lived to hear the principles of eter- nal life proclaimed to the sons of  men; I rejoice that I have lived to  see this people gathered together, I  rejoice in coming to the land of  Zion with the Saints of God.  When  we came here twenty-four years ago, we were a little handful of men,  pioneers; we came to a parched and  barren desert.  Since then we have  built up six hundred miles of cities,  towns, villages, gardens, farms and  orchards; and while doing this we  have had to contend with the opposi- tion of both priest and people.  Have  they prevailed?  They have not, and  they will not.  Why?  Because he  who sits in the heavens, the Lord our God, has decreed certain things and  they will come to pass; because the  Lord is watching over the interests  of this people.  He requires us to  work with him, he is at work for us. It is our duty to build these temples  here--this in Salt Lake City, another  in St. George, in Logan or wherever  they may be needed for the benefit of  the Saints of God in the latter days. I think many times that many of  us will get to heaven before we shall  want to go there[.] If we were to go  there to-day, many would meet  their friends in the spirit-world and  it would be a reproach to them, for 
 280  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  you, Latter-day Saints, in one sense  of the word, hold in your hands the  salvation of your dead, for we can  do much for them.  But I think  many times that our hearts are too  much set on the vain things of the  world to attend to many important  duties devolving upon us connected  with the Gospel.  We are too much  after gold and silver, and we give our hearts and attention to temporal matters at the expense of the light  and truth of the Gospel of Jesus  Christ.  We have not much time to spare  as a people, for a grea[t] work is re- quired at our hands.  I know that,  without the power of God, we should  not have been able to do what has  been done; and I also know that we  never should be able to build up the  Zion of God in power, beauty and  glory were it not that our prayers  ascends into the ears of the Lord God  of Sabaoth, and he hears and answers  them.  The world has sought our  overthrow from the beginning, and  the devil does not like us very well. Lucifer, the Son of the Morning, does not like the idea of revelation to  the Saints of God, and he has in- spired the hearts of a great many  men, since the Gospel was restored to  the earth, to make war against us. But not one of them has made any- thing out of it yet--neither glory, immortality, eternal life nor money. No man or people ever did make any- thing by fighting against God in the  past, and no man or people will ever  make anything by taking that course  in the future.  This is the work and kingdom of  God; this is the Zion of God and the  Church of Christ, and we are called by his name.  The Latter-day Saints have to abide in Christ, and we can  not do that unless we bring forth  fruit, any more than the branch of the  vine can unless it abide in the vine. To abide in Christ we must enjoy the  Spirit of God, that our minds may be  enlightened to comprehend the things  of God.  When I look at the history  of the Church of God in these latter- days I many times marvel at what has been done and how we have  progressed, considering the traditions,  unbelief, failings, follies and nonsense  that man is heir to in the flesh.  We  have had a great many traditions to  overcome and the opposition of the  world to contend with from the  beginning until to-day.  Brethren and  sisters, we should be faithful.  The  Lord has put into our hands the power  to build up his Zion and kingdom on  the earth, and we have more to encou- rage us than was ever possessed by  any generation that has preceded  us.  We have the privilege of build- ing up a kingdom that will stand for  ever.  Noah and the Antediluvian  world did not have this privilege. Enoch built up the Zion of God a  little while, and the Lord took it  away.  Jesus and the Apostles came here. Jesus fulfilled his mission, preached the Gospel, was rejected by  the Jews, and was crucified.  His  disciples had a similar fate, and the  Gospel was taken to the Gentile nation, with all its gifts and blessings and power, and Paul the Apostle of  the Gentiles warned them to take  heed lest they, in turn, should lose it  through their unbelief.  You know how it has been with  them--that there has been a falling  away, and that for seventeen hun- dred years the voice of a Prophet or  Apostle has not been heard in the  world; and now again, in these lat- ter days, the Lord Almighty, re- membering his promises made from  generation to generation, has sent  Angels from heaven to restore to  man the Gospel and has given au- thority to administer the same. The Revelator John, says he saw 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.  281  an angel flying through the  midst of heaven, having the ever- lasting Gospel to preach to them  that dwell on the earth, to every  nation, kindred, tongue and people, saying with a loud voice, "Fear God and give glory to him who  made the heavens, the earth, the  seas and the fountains of water, for the  hour of God's judgment has come."  Oh! ye Gentile nations, wake up  and prepare yourselves for that  which is to come, for as God lives  his judgments are at your door. They are at the door of our nation,  and the thrones and kingdoms of  the whole world will fall, and all the efforts of men combined cannot  save them.  It is a day of warning, but not of many words, to the na- tions.  The Lord is going to make a  short work, or no flesh could be  saved.  If it were not for the mani- festation of the power of God what  would be the fate of his Zion and  people?  The same as in the days of  Christ and his Apostles.  The Lord  has had Zion before his face from before the foundation of the world, and he is going to build it up.  "Who am I," saith the Lord, "that  I promise and do not fulfill?"  The  Lord never made a promise to the  sons of men which he has not ful- filled, therefore Latter-day Saints,  you have all the encouragement in the world to sustain you in the faith  that the Zion of God will remain on the earth.  The work is in our hands to perform, the God of hea- ven requires it of us and if we fail  to build it up we shall be under con- demnation, and the Lord would  remove us out of the way and he  would raise up another people who would do it.  Why?  Because the  Almighty has decreed that this work  shall be performed on the earth, and  no power on earth or in hell can hin- der it.  I would here say to our delegate  to Congress, when you go to Wash- ington, have no fears with regard to  the opposition of men.  You have  every reason to go in confidence,  and do your duty, knowing that  the Lord will stand by you, and so  has every man in the Church and  kingdom of God, I care not where  we are placed or what God requires  at our hands.  He is at the helm,  and he has protected us until to- day.  Where should we have been a  few years ago when the army was  sent to destroy us, if it had not been  for the protection of the Almighty? We should not have been here. And so it will be in days to come. The world hate us because the Al- mighty has called us out from the  world to proclaim his Gospel and  build up his kingdom.  Let us be  faithful, for the Lord is going to  protect us, and build up Zion.  He  will also gather Israel, rebuild Je- rusalem and prepare the way for his  second coming, in the clouds of  heaven.  Then let us, Latter-day  Saints, wake up to our duty.  Think nothing too hard that the Lord re- quires of us.  Let us build this  Temple that we may attend to the  ordinances for the living and the  dead.  If we not do this we shall be  sorry.  When I see men who have  received the word of God, and tasted  the powers of the world to come, and  then turn away, I think of the par- able of the five wise and five foolish  virgins.  It will pay us to be wise  and to have oil in our lamps, to have  fellowship with the Holy Spirit, and  to live our religion and keep the  commandments of God day by day. Brethren are passing away.  I have  been away three or four weeks on a  visit to the people in the upper settle- ments, and since my return I hear of  this man and that man dead, whom I  saw well and hale before I went away. 
 282  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  So it will be with us in a little while. We shall pass away and go to the  other side of the vail, and the burden  of the building up of Zion will rest  upon our sons and daughters.  Then  rejoice in the Gospel of Christ.  Re- joice in the principles of eternal life. I am looking for the fulfillment of all things that the Lord has spoken, and  they will come to pass as the Lord  God lives.  Zion is bound to rise and  flourish.  The Lamanites will blos- som as the rose on the mountains.  I  am willing to say here that, though I  believe this, when I see the power of  the nation destroying them from the  face of the earth, the fulfillment of  that prophecy is perhaps harder for  me to believe than any revelation of  God that I ever read.  It looks as  though there would not be enough  left to receive the Gospel; but not- withstanding this dark picture, every  word that God has ever said of them  will have its fulfillment, and they, by  and by, will receive the Gospel.  It  will be a day of God's power among  them, and a nation will be born in a  day.  Their chiefs will be filled with  the power of God and receive the  Gospel, and they will go forth and build the new Jerusalem, and we shall help them.  They are branches of  the house of Israel, and when the  fullness of the Gentiles has come in  and the work ceases among them, then  it will go in power to the seed of  Abraham.  Brethren and sisters, let us remem- ber our position before the Lord!  Let  us try and keep the faith, let us labor  for the Holy Spirit, that our hearts, minds and eyes may be opened, that  we may live by inspiration, that when  we see dark clouds rising and evils strewing our path, we may be able to  overcome [.] The Savior was tempted, so were his Apostles, and if we have  not been we shall be.  As the Lord  told Joseph Smith, "I will try and  prove you in all things, even unto  death.  If you are not willing to abide  my covenants unto death, you are  not worthy of me."  Did Joseph  abide unto death?  I think he did, and he with Abraham, Isaac and  Jacob, will sit at the right hand of  the Lord Jesus Christ, and will re- ceive his glory and crown.  He was  true and faithful unto death, and his  testimony is in force to-day, in lan- guage as loud as ten tho[u]sand thun- ders.  Whether it is believed or re- jected it will have its fulfillment on  the heads of this generation.  By and by great Babylon will fall  and there will be wailing, mourning  and sore affliction in her midst.  The  sons of Zion have got to stand in holy  places to be preserved in the midst of  the judgments that will shortly over- take the world.  We can see how fully  the revelation, calling us to go to  the western countries, has been ful- filled.  In less than forty years, a  standard has been lifted up, and peo- ple gathered here from France, Eng- land, Scotland, Wales, Denmark,  Norway, Sweden, and almost all the  nations of the earth in fulfillment of  that revelation.  When it was given  no man among us knew anything  about Salt Lake or the Rocky Moun- tains; but it has been fulfilled before  our eyes.  We have come up here,  and in so doing have fulfilled the re- velations of God, so far.  Let us  continue, I pray God my heavenly  Father that he will bless the Latter- day Saints; that he will give us his  Holy Spirit and wisdom, that our  eyes may be opened, that we may  have faith in the things of God.  Let  a man lose the Holy Spirit and what  faith has he?  None, either in God  or in his revelations, and that is what  is the matter to-day.  You may take  the best friends we have outside of  of this kingdom, and you can hardly  get them to believe that God has any- 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN.  283  thing to do with the affairs of men,  or that he has power to do anything  for them, either as individuals or na- tions.  If their eyes were open one  moment they would understand that  God holds them all in the hollow of  his hand, weighs them in the balance  and that they cannot make a move  without his permission.  They would  no longer wonder why the Latter-day  Saints have faith in God if their eyes  were open so that they could under- stand the work and things of God. They can not understand it, they  cannot even see the kingdom of God  unless they are born of the Spirit of  God, and they cannot enter into it  unless they are born of the water and  the Spirit, according to the words of  Jesus to Nicodemus.  I have a desire that we may be  faithful in our mission and ministry, as Elders of Israel and as Saints of  God, that we may do our duty, and  maintain our position before the Lord. Let our prayers go up before him.  If  I have any forte it is prayer to God. We are not called to build up Zion  by preaching, singing and praying  alone; we have to perform hard  labor, labor of bone and sinew, in  building towns, cities, villages; and  we have to continue to do this; but  while we are so engaged, we should  not sin.  We have no right to sin,  whether we are in the kanyon draw- ing wood, or performing any other  hard labor, and we should have the  Spirit of God to direct us then as  much as when preaching, praying,  singing and attending to the ordinan- ces of the house of God.  If we do  this as a people we shall grow in the  favor and power of God.  We should  be united together, it is our duty to  be so.  Our prayers should ascend  before God, and I know they do.  I  know that President Young is prayed  for--I know that his counselors and  the Twelve are prayed for, and that  the Church and kingdom of God is  prayed for.  We should continue this,  and if we pray in faith we shall have  what we ask for.  The Lord has  taught us to pray, and I rejoice that  I have learned to pray according to  the order of God, for in this we have  a promise--that where two or three  agree in asking for any thing that is  just and right, it shall be granted  unto them.  May God bless you!  May he give  us wisdom, and his Holy Spirit to  guide us, that we may be enabled to  be true and faithful to our covenants, and be prepared to inherit eternal  life, for Jesus' sake.  Amen. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff. No man can preach  the Gospel of Jesus Christ without the spirit and power  thereof no matter what his, qualities are; and there  never has been a time when this spirit is more needed  than now. Related incidents that occured during  his missions in the world. when the power of evil spirits was made manifest, Especially on the in- troduction of the Gospel in England. Apostacy  is the result of these evil influences. Refered to  the great apostacy in Kirtland. Said, God will take  care of His Church, of the leaders, all who hold  the Priesthood; and we must sustain them, or  we will go to destruction as many have. Had  not Joseph and those associated with him accepted  the revelation on Celestial marriage, this gospel  would have been taken from the Earth. And I beleive 
 1875  the same same is true of the United Order. We can see the hand of the Lord in the movement  concerning genealogy in the Eastern States. This  is the result of the revelation concerning Bap- tism for the dead. We are now enabled to  trace our genealogy to all our progenitors behind  the vail. The prophet of each dispensation Seals  his testimony with his blood. Related his ex- perience at the time the prophet Joseph  was killed. The Church has passed into a  new dispensation, and our leader will not be  assasssinated, all who oppose Israil will  go down judges, Govenor, Presidents &c. The  Mothers of Isral have the training of their chil- dren, as the Elders are from home; hence they  have great responsibility 
 Elder W. Woodruff, illustrated the difference between the Prophet Joseph and the Rev. Drs. of the  day. We are asked why the Lord chose one in ign- orance to reveal His Gospel. It was to have one who ^would^ heed His word. Alluded to the mighty occurrencis cotemporaneous with the Gospel. Especially the histor- ical & genealogical Society of New England. If the Prophet Joseph had refused the revelation on Celestial Marriage the Church would have stopped there. In all ages of the world, God has had those Spirits who were called before the foundation of the  world through whom to reveal His will. This is the case to-day with the United Order of which we seem to be afraid. As if God would reveal any thing for our harm. Uttered condemnation for many of the follies & extravagances of fashion. God, the Holy Prophets and all the hosts of Heaven are looking to us to for help. Let us do it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff spoke of the privilege  of bearing a testimony. He said, the Gospel of  Jesus Christ is just as true to-day as it ever was ^yet^,  but very few people are independent enough to  serve the Lord. This is God's work, and there are  but few who can be used as the Lord desires, they  would want their own way, hence the Lord chooses  the obedient, and not partial thereby. Even the  Apostles of the Savior were men of low degree.  The Lord will prevail and nothing can stay His  hand. We are to be a tried people, as we heard  this morning. Yet the faithful will be saved as has  been revealed, for every revelation will be fulfill- ed. Elders have compassed the world, and always  been sustained. We will be held accountable for 
 1876  all things we receive, for the Lord has all things. No  generation before has ever had so much to perform as we  have. Spoke of the organization of the church by the Prophet  Joseph of its completeness and power, all of which  is the result of God's providences manifested in our be- half; for it is His work, yet we must do our part.  The year the baptism of the dead was revealed, a society  was organized, to obtain the genealogy and history  of the society as well as others. Spoke at length  on this subject, urging the Saints to prosecute the work  on the Temple; that the living and the dead may be  cared for. I desire now to labor only with the Saints  and for the dead. He said, there are millions to be  cared for. 
 SYNOPSIS OF A  DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  DELIVERED IN THE PROVO MEETING HOUSE, OCT. 13, 1877.  (From the Territorial Enquirer.)  THE WORK PROGRESSING-PROPHECY FULFILLED-WE SHALL ALL OBEY  THE LAW OF DEATH.  It was with pleasure I listened  this morning to the remarks of bro- ther Snow, and wish that all the  people in this Stake had heard them. We have had a great deal of preach- ing, and need a great deal, and I  don't know that a people ever lived  who had more.  We are in the valleys of the  mountains for a special purpose-to  establish righteousness and live in  accordance with the principles of  truth. There never was a generation  of people who had so much to per- form as the Latter-day Saints have. This work is progressing, and it will  continue to advance. I have seen  the time when you could get the  whole Church into this room   when  there were a few High Priests, no  Apostles or Seventies, and only a few  Elders. I am as thoroughly satisfied  now as I ever was in my life, that  this is the kingdom of God. I am as  firm a believer in God, in the reve- lations of God, in the Books of Mor- mon and Doctrine and Covenants, as  I ever was. I have read the prophe- cies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and  other inspired writers, and have seen  some of them fulfilled, and expect  to see others have their literal ful- fillment. God worked with the  children of men through revelation,  and he will continue to do so in this  generation. With him there is no  change; his ways are one eternal  round.  The Lord has directed and guided  this work from the beginning. The  prophecies relating to the present  dispensation   to Zion being estab- lished in the tops of the mountains   to the building of cities and Temples 
 THE WORK PROGRESSING, ETC. 135    are being fulfilled. We have no- thing to do but build up the king- dom of God, and the more light and  understanding we get, the less our  hearts will cling to outside things. While we are engaged in this work,  we can realize that holy angels are  watching us. The Lord told us,  forty-seven years ago, what would  take place, and we are now fulfilling  that which he spoke of. Brothers  Joseph and Brigham are gone into  the spirit world, but there are a few of us left to continue the work laid  out by the Almighty. We have  preached to the world, organized the  Priesthood and the Saints, and  angels have borne record of this, and  it is recorded in heaven   our toil,  our preaching, and our testimony. We have filled these once desert  places with Saints of the living God, and many thousands are here who  never saw the world. We have to  build Temples   one is almost com- pleted and is dedicated; we have  laid the foundations of others, and the work, like a panorama, is before  us. This labor is not to be per- formed by other hands. God looks  to us to build these Temples, and to  bring about the redemption of the  earth. He holds us responsible for  this work; we have to preach to  the house of Israel   to the Laman- ites   to gather together the honest  in heart from all parts of the earth. We are chosen to perform this great  and important work-we, a small  handful of people compared with the  millions of human beings on the  earth. The Lord does not expect  any other people but the Latter-day  Saints to do this work; there is no- body else preparing.  One after another of our brethren  have left us and gone to labor on the  other side of the veil. President  Brigham Young, brother George A. Smith, and others before them, have  all gone, and the few that are left of  the Twelve will also go by and by; but while here, it is our duty to  labor on the foundation they have  laid. President Young labored hard  and faithful during the last few years  of his life in organizing and building  up Zion. We have to continue the  work they were engaged in, and  when our time comes to take our  departure for that life behind the  veil, none of us will regret having  devoted our time, talents, and labor  for the accomplishment of this great  object. The riches of the world will  appear as the dust under our feet  compared with the eternal reward  before us.  This kingdom will never be given  into the hands of another people. We may pass away, but our sons and  daughters will have the labor on their shoulders of building up the  kingdom.  Many of you may have read, years  before it was fulfilled, the revelation  and prophecy of the Prophet Joseph  in regard to the trouble, anarchy, and war that should befall this na- tion. Wise men said its fulfillment  was a matter of impossibility-that  the government was too sound and  too well established for such a cala- mity to occur, but the fulfillment  came. When the Lord undertakes  to perform a work, he is certain to  carry it out. It would not take the  Lord twenty-four hours to cause  war, anarchy, confusion, and judg- ments to come upon the nation. He  is withholding these calamities until his purposes are accomplished.  The set time has come, and the  world is preparing itself for these  things. The Church and kingdom of  God must adorn itself, and prepare  for the coming of the Great Bride- groom. Every key relating to this  dispensation was given to the Pro- phet Joseph, and they remain with 
 136 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  the Priesthood today. We have no  right to walk in the dark. The  burden is now resting upon us, and,  holding the Priesthood, our aim  should be building up of the  kingdom of God. We hold the  Priesthood for that purpose, and we  have no business to use it for any- thing else but to officiate in the  ordinances of the house of God.  Sooner or later we shall have to  obey the law of death. As it is  written, "In Adam all died, so in  Christ shall all be made alive."  We shall have to pass through the ordeal    there is no escape from it. We have, consequently, no time to throw  away. It may be asked, "How  much longer will it be before the  winding up scene takes place?  It  is not for me to say. How much longer have the Elders to suffer violence at the hands of the wicked? It appears to me that the world is  about ripe for the judgments of the  Lord, and that the testimony will  soon be sealed. He is already work- ing with the Lamanites, and he will  accomplish a great deal in a little  time.  Some people entertain the idea that because wheat is plentiful and  selling at exceedingly low figures, the probability of a famine is more  remote than ever; but the Lord  makes no mistakes about what is  going to transpire. He has decreed the visitation of judgments, and they  are certain to take place. President  Young has for years repeatedly im- pressed upon the brethren the neces- sity of preparing for a period of  famine by storing their wheat, and,  before his death, was impressed to  speak to the sisters and urge them  to look after that matter. Let us  be united in our labors, and in all the branches of industry that males  or females may be engaged in. The raising of silk may be rendered an  important item in the industry of  this Territory. It is a business that  our wives and children can engage in, and there is nothing to hinder  the people from becoming rich from  this branch of industry alone. There  is an improvement in the United  Order, or Co-operation. The Saints  are preparing themselves for that  event when Jesus shall come as a  thief in the night. For our own sakes let us do the best we possibly  can. We must observe and keep the laws of God, in order to inherit  the rewards promised. Let us not  set our hearts on the riches and  vanities of this earth. It is very  convenient, it is true, to have the  comforts of life around us, but we  shall be better without them, if by  hoarding up the riches of the world  we forget the things of God.  I pray God to bless you and our  sons and daughters, that their minds  may be led and prepared for the  work they will be called upon to  perform. 
 Apostle W. Woodruff addressed the congregation Said.  Joseph Smith was asked once by a clergaman, if all the  people outside of the mormons, to which the Prophet replied  yes, and one half of them if they do not repent.  Spake of the great number of men and women who had joined  the church, and afterwards apostatise from the church.  And lost  their Priesthood, their power, Glory, dommions.  Read a prayer offered up by Joseph the Prophet in Liberty Jail, in  relation to the long sufferring endured by hinself & coreligen- ousts.  The general duties of the Saints was dwelt upon, and,  the magmatude of the great work before us.  Spoke of  great benifit the B. Y. Academy was doing in the land and  hoped it would receive the liberal support of the Saints. encouraged the Young to qualify themselves for the great  work before them. 
 Pres. W. Woodruff: Spoke of the dealing of  God in the history of the world.  Had noticed  that whenever nations departed from the paths  of vuirtuue and righteousness, they were cast  down.  Whenever men served God he upheld and  and sustained them.  But of all the changes  that have taken place from Father Adam one  thing has never changed -- and that is the Gos- pel of Jesus Christ.  Referred to the mechanical improvements of the latter times, all tending to  the gathering of Isreal in these days.  Spoke of  ancient prophecy and its litteral fulfillment. Spoke of the stupendous work of the Saints in  the few years they have been in the valleys of  Ephraim.  Spoke of the swift judgments that  would come upon those who have persecuted  the Saints.  We have not got through with the  warning of the nations.  I am getting more en- larged in my feelings regarding the people of  the nations, we are baptizing a hundred a month  in the Southern States.  The Lord will fight our  battles if we will keep his commandments and  build his temples.  The young men will have to  bear off this kingdom.  Made a powerful exhort- tation to the Saints to be faithful. 
 Apostele Woodruff made remarks as follows. Said that while he was in Arizona Gen. Sherman [rewoh] was there; remarked that it was a shame for the govern- ment to charge the Mormans any thing for the land. But the time will come when we will see the blessings and wisdom displayed in sending that that colony. As I have often said, it seemed almost impossible toofor mortal man to live in these valleys when we first come here. But we shall soon understand why God wants these places setted. The Lord re- quires many things of us that has not been required of others generations. The Lord expects us to work with him in the redemption of his Kingdom. The time will come when we will be required to practice what we teach. Important events are about to transpire in Zion. 
 BLESSINGS, ETC.  BLESSINGS--TRIALS--OBEDIENCE TO COUNSEL, ETC. Remarks by Elder Wilford Woodruff, delivered in the Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, Sunday Morning, September 27, 1857,  We are glad to see the brethren  return home from their long missions  or short ones.  We are glad to greet  them, to hear them talk, to see their  faces, and to hear their testimony that  the Lord has been with them,  These  things are a pleasure to us who re- main here in Zion.  There are a  multiplicity of evidences that God is  with this people, and that the Lord  has been with his Elders, wherever they have been, from the beginning  of this work.  There has been something peculiar  connected with the Elders of this  Church from the beginning.  You  may take the rest of the world, poli- tically, temporally, spiritually, or any  other way ; and there never has been such an example in the eyes of hea- ven, earth, or hell as has been in the  Elders of this Church, in preaching this Gospel to the nations of the  earth.  The hand of God has been  in the work from the beginning, and  it is in it yet; and the hand of the  Lord has been with them to succour  them all the time.  The revelations  given from heaven, through Joseph,  concerning the Elders, have been  fulfilled to the very letter.  There are many things that are  consoling ; and one is, to know that  the Lord is with us that he does  reveal his mind and will in the ordi- nances of the house of God, and  through the administration of bles- sings, whether by Patriarchs, or by  the Twelve Apostles, or in the endow- ments.  We find those blessings are  fulfilled to the very letter.  The brethren to-day have spoken  in reference to the blessings that are  given to our brethren when they go  out on their missions to the various  nations of the earth.  I remember  the day very well when we blessed those  missionaries that went to India and to  Europe; and I must say that I never  had such a variety of feelings as I had  at that time.  In blessing brother Luddington,  I recollect that I was mouth, and I  well remember that I could see  nothing but seas, waves, and storms. The seas appeared to be heaped up, and I knew that he was going to see  storms and be exposed to troubles  and dangers.  But there was one  thing that we did bless those brethren  with that I rejoice in, and that is  that they should return home again.  Well, our words have all been ful- filled to the very letter, and this gives  us consolation.  If we go forth, and  have the Priesthood and Apostleship  upon us, the Holy Spirit of God,  though it may not be visible,  does dictate to us; and it is so in  ordaining:  it is so in going to battle  against the nations of the earth, who  have given their consent to the shed- ding of the blood of the Prophets.  Brother Brigham feels calm and  serene as a summer's morning; and  in his desire to save Israel he wishes  to save also the lives of our enemies, if possible.  Why is he so calm and 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  steady?  It is because God is with  him; and though armies are ap- proaching and ready, apparently, to  swallow up this people, yet he and  his brethren feel calm, and the Lord  reveals unto them, by the Holy Spirit, how to govern and control this people. They have had a long experience in  proving the Almighty God, who holds  the destiny of the Saints and the  sinner.  And has he ever failed us? No, never.  Some of our brethren have told  their trials here to-day, and they have  said that they have not done much; but the greatest work they have done  has been in saving themselves.  But  this is not all they have done.  They  have done something else; they have  accomplished the purposes of God in  India as much so as though they had  baptized every king and queen in  those islands:  they have literally  fulfilled the revelations of Jesus  Christ in carrying the Gospel unto  them, because those nations could  not have been left without excuse  and the earth prepared for the judg- ments of God, if those Elders had  not gone and preached to the people  of those nations.  No matter if they  had not have baptised one, they are  as much justified as we who first went  to Herefordshire, England, and bap- tised twenty or thirty priests in a  day.  They have fulfilled the com- mandments in carrying the Gospel to  the nations.  It is no testimony to me that a  man is not faithful, because he has  not baptised numbers of princes,  lords, governors, and kings; not at  all.  The Lord has sent them there:  he has tried them and put them in  strait places; but has he left them? No, he has not.  Has he not brought  them forth?  We have had the testi- mony of brother Musser, who is here; and we see that it is the hand of God  that has been over them, and we are  glad of it; and we do not expect that  the Lord will send the Elders out  there again until they have other  missionaries and messengers that they  cannot stone, tar, or feather, but mes- sengers that will come with their  sharp sickles:  then they will find  that they have messengers that they  cannot conquer or overcome.  I feel to rejoice in these things and to know that the Lord is at work with this people.  We are living in a  fast age an age fraught with great  events, and every day is bringing to  pass more of the predictions; and  more revelation is being fulfilled  in one year, now, than has been fulfilled in centuries before.  We are living in  a day when that flood of revelation is  coming to a focus; and that focus we  stand in, and we are seeing it fulfilled  day by day.  The wicked rage and the heathen  imagine a vain thing; and they say,  "Let us go and take a prey and a  spoil; let our eye be upon Zion, and let  her be defiled."  But they know not the  thoughts of the Lord, neither under- stand they his counsel.  God will work for us and defend us, if we do  our duty, and Zion will soon be free. We will not suffer the oppressions of  our enemies as we have done.  You need not fear: all we have to  do is to be passive in the hands of the  Lord, and follow the counsel of our  leaders, and not be particularly anx- ious that the Lord should reveal to  you or to me his mind and will and  intentions concerning our present  difficulties; but pray earnestly that  the Spirit of the Lord may be upon  those men who stand at the head. All we have to do is to live our reli- gion; and when the Presidency say  "Come here," or "Go there," let us  be on hand to obey, and all will be  right.  Let the people be quiet and pray that God may reveal his mind and will to those at the head.  We may have  our ideas of what we should do in this 
 BLESSINGS, ETC.  or that case; but there is no man so  well qualified to lead, govern, and  direct for the salvation of the people  as that man whom God has appointed. We have as good leaders as we need. There never was a better leader given  to Israel, nor one more capable of  leading this people to salvation, than Brigham Young: he is filled with the  Spirit of God day by day.  If the  United States make war upon this  people, the Lord will hold them re- sponsible for it, and the measure they  mete will be measured unto them  again; and if they are ripe and the cup of their iniquity full, they will be shat- tered to pieces--their union broken up  and destroyed.  They will be visited  with thunder and lightning and hail  and the judgments of God; and  every man that will not draw his sword  against his neighbour will be obliged to  flee to Zion.  They are sending their  armies here to destroy us; but I ask  none to weep for Utah or spend  their sympathy for us not even my  relatives or the priests, the doctors,  lawyers, or editors; no, not even one  soul from the President of the United  States down through the whole nation, who have given consent to our death; for they will have plenty to bear them- selves, and they may save their weep- ing for themselves and their children. The Lord will teach them that their  proud looks and haughty feelings will  be laid low.  It is right to pray and  it is right to keep our powder dry.  Pray  for the Presidency of this Church-- pray for them to have the Spirit of  revelation.  We have never seen a  day when "Mormonism" was taking  such a stride as it is at the present time.  They may come over the Plains  singing their songs about what they  will do when they get to Utah; but  many of them will find a place in hell before they get here.  There have been many truths taught  here to-day.  Many who have been  here for years do not know or realize  the great blessings we are enjoying in these valleys of mountains. Our gra- naries are filled with bread and we  enjoy peace and the comforts of life. We come to the Tabernacle of God and  associate with holy men, and we should  be holy ourselves: if we are not, it is  our own fault.  You have all the blessings which  the celestial kingdom and laws of God  impart unto men on the earth, while  the Gentile nations have suffered ruin, wickedness, and abominations of every  kind to increase in their midst until they are ripe for destruction.  Do they  not thirst for the blood of the Saints  and every man who is righteous?  Do  they not delight in wickedness?   They  are full of wrath and anger, and they  are ripe for the damnation of hell. Yes, the nations of the earth are ripe to-day.  Then we should be faithful and  diligent in all things committed to  our charge.  Even though the Lord has suffered some of the brethren to  go through strait places, in days which  are past and gone, and he may still call us to go through strait places, yet  he will sustain us when we trust in  him.  The Lord has suffered some of our  Prophets and Apostles to be martyred;  and what for?  That the cup of the  iniquity of the nations might be full and that his servants might be crowned  heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus  Christ to a martyr's crown.  Through the persecutions of the enemies of truth, many of the Saints have been worn out; but, as a body, the  kingdom and people have been led off  as victorious conquerers. We stand  now and hold the keys of the American continent; we stand in the Strong cham- bers of the mountains; and can the Lord God give us the Victory? He can and he will, and he has been pre- paring us for this by pouring out upon  us his Holy Spirit, uniting the people who have been willing to repent and 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  forsake their sins; and I hope we shall  continue faithful to the end.  I am glad, and my soul rejoices in  these things, and I believe that the  people are ready to shoulder their  guns and walk into these kanyons and  line them from here to Fort Bridger  in defence of the Constitution of the  United States and the rights which  both the laws of God and man guar- antee to us.  We have had to stoop to our ene- mies heretofore and bear many things  from them worse than death; but if  there is anything that gives us joy and  consolation at least, I can speak for  myself it was when I heard the bre- thren say, "You are free, brethren you  are free; and you may prove yourselves  before God and men that you are  willing to defend yourselves against  tyrants and oppressors."  When I heard this, I was full of  joy; and who would not be?  Who would not rather die than bow down to the  yoke of the enemy?  It would sweeten  death to a man to know that he should lay down his life in defence of free- dom and the kingdom of God rather  than to longer bow to the cruelty of  mobs, even if the mob have the name  of being legalized by the nation.  I thank God and I rejoice that this  people are determined to be free from mobocracy and oppression, and that  they are determined to have peace, if  they have to fight for it; and if the yoke  is ever put on again, it will be by our-  selves: and I say, God bless this people and the missionaries that have gone  to the nations no matter whether  they have baptized one or a thousand, if they have done the will of God.  Notwithstanding the lightnings may flash, thunders roll, and earth- quakes bellow, the Lord will extend  his hand over his servants and protect  them as he has done those that have  returned unto us.  And the Lord will  remember our brethren that are on the  Plains; and let us remember them in  our prayers, that the Lord may be on  our side; and let us be on hand  and be ready at any and every call, and the kingdom will spread abroad, and it  will smite the image not only on the  toes but on the head; which may God  grant for our sake.  Amen. 
 Report of the four months ending April 30th 1878 after which Elder W Wordruff spoke on the unity of the faith and action among the true believers in the Gospel of Christ and the des- position of man in all ages to oppose its ex- istence 
 At 2 P.M. Meeting resumed Apostle Wordruff   introduced his remarks with the Quotation "Straight  is the Gate and narrow is the way &c reverting to the task of the Saints in keeping the path of the Gospel beset with temptations, which would be over come with the help of God and faith in his strong promises to help those who confided in him. spoke of the rapid growth of the work in Joseph's day special Revelation was given in regard to special individual calls for missionary service while now large numbers are called and set apart for Missionary Service on account of the demand for their Labors being so great 
 Apostle W Woodruff: refered to the teaching's of the Prophet Joseph Smith relative to warnings and impressions recieved at times which should be acted upon relating incidents of impressions recieved and acted upon during his life which had saved his own and the lives of others. 
 Apostle W Woodruff  followed on the bleessings the observance of the Law of Tithing brought to the Saints. blessed as we were so apparent to the traveller passing through our midst, we should be careful to discharge this law and also meet all obligations promptly that confidence may be  maintained 
 Prest Willford Woodruff followed, referring  to the great advantages the Latter-day  Saints of the present age had over all the  people to whom God had previously manifested  himself and the Gospel, more Revelations were  given, more inspired men lived to instruct  the people, which together with the easy access  to the inspired works, the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants, made a combination  of instruction that no other people had prior  to the present day. 
 Prest  W Woodruff: then  addressed the congregation dwelling upon  the great blessings enjoyed by the people  through their obedience to the laws of the  Gospel, referring to the rapid growth of the  people in acquiring the comforts of life around  them, the wonder of the nations at the success  that attended the work and the bitter end of  many of those who had from time to time  opposed the work citing individual cases, exhorting  the people through their knowledge of these facts  to live faithful to their covenants. 
 Prest W Woodruff  then addressed the  audience expressing himself in strong  terms "that the time had come when the  Elders of Israel must pratice what they  teach in order to effect upon the minds of  the people," especially should it be or in  regard to the Word of Wisdom: concluding  with "I view you Brethren holding the priesthood  as chosen before the world was, to work here  upon the Earth to support his cause. 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 30, 1888.  Elder James W. Bean,  Stake Clerk, Utah Stake.  DEAR BROTHER:  Your communication of the 27th. inst., addressed to myself and the Quorum of the Twelve, informs me that, in accordance with a resolution adopted by the unanimous vote of the priesthood of Utah Stake, you send your communica- tion asking for ten thousand dollars -[$10000.00]- of the tithing of the Stake for the current year, to aid you in the completion of the Utah Stake Tabernacle.  The position of the Church in financial matters is such at the present time that it is impossible for us to comply with this resolution. We shall have to strain every nerve and use all the means within our possession, or that is likely to come into our possession for some time, to meet the engage- ments that are already contracted. In view of this, the Council of the Apostles some weeks ago decided to cease making appropriations, for the present, for the benefit of any meeting houses in our settlements. We have had a number of applications since then, which we have filed away, to be taken up in their order when circumstances become more favorable. The case at which the Council stopped 
 was one that appealed very strongly to their sympathies, but it was thought that it was a good place to stop at, as there would probably be no other case that would be likely to call forth aid more strongly than it. The present prospect is that we shall need all the tithing tahat we can collect to meet outstanding engagements and to pay our currect expenses; and if we can do this without contracting debts, we shall feel happy.  Trusting this explanation will be satisfactory to the priesthood of Utah Stake, and regretting the necessity which compels this line of action,  I remain, Your Brother, Wilford Woodruff 
 Copy Salt Lake City, Utah April 7, 1881 Dear Bro. John W. Young, Elders Erastus Snow, Brigham Young and Jesse N. Smith were appointed last fall  by the First Presidency of the church in counjunctionwith yourslef to take charge of the interests of the saints and the care and oversight of all their parties which might be working on the lines of the Denver and Rio Gande and Altantic and Pacific Railroad in grading, furninshing ties, laying track +c, and to make contracts and to asist in making contracts in their interests, and instruct and counsel  them in the duties of their religion, and in  the management of their busness affairs, and in securing the means that should be  due to them upon their contracts.  A Letter  of Instructions was written by the First  Presidency for the guidance of these Elders and yourself in the duties assigned to you, in which you were directed to do everything  necessary to give all equal rights in the various jobs and you were instructed to see that the supplies should be provided Rubyech to the action or adjustment of the Various boards, no one man, or a few men to receive the profits there from and that everything was to be done in the mlerch of all.  That 
 Letter said "I wish to impress upon you and the brethren who will labor in the conjunction with you, that it is not the privelege of any man or company of men to take advantage of the circumstances of the people and their necessities and farm them out for their private profit.  As latter day-Saints we are all equal, and we should  labor for each other's benefit--and no man  should selfishly build himself up or enrich himself at the expense of his brother or brethren.  If he has superior advantages either of position or of skill, let him have a fair remumeration there for;but beyond  this he should not go.  He should labor as we  all should for the welfare, advancement and  prosperity of the people.  In this way good  feeling will be maintained and the saints  will see that their leading men are their true friends, and are not disposed to oppress them and to make mechandise of them.  There is freah room for the mereaso of confidence in this direction, and we hope that you will  dr use all your influence in creating their con- fidence and in showing your brethren that we have their true welfare at heart.  If we take this course and act together in this manner among ourselves, and maintains the same principles of equity in our dealings with other who are 
 not of us, the reputation of the Latter-day- Saints will be greatly increased and influence will be created in our favor that will result in  incalculable benefit to us as a people, for  the world is so destitute of these qualities that when people witness them they are im- pressed by theim and recognise and acknowledge their worth. as to yourselves, for the labor hwich you  perform among the people in counselling, in directing, in securing contracts and in seemy that all the business is properly alleuded to, and that the pay can be relied upon, you should derive a reasonable percentage.  We  have thought that in view of all the expenses connected with the labor, five per cent would be a proper amount; but of course when you many other agents secure contracts and perform other labor connected there with, for this small percentage, it should not be expected that you will, in the event of the  company failing to make payments, be responisble for the Day." since the return of the elders Erastus Snow  and Brigham Young we have leaned that  they and Borther Jesse, N. Smith submitted a memorandum in writing to you embodying some of the principal points of the letter of instructions and requiring you to hold 
 sacred the money received in estimates for grading less the maount necessary for to pay for supples furnished and sking for [your] action on your part with them in securing to the sub contractors just dues under the contracts mad eiwhtthem by Elders Brigham Young  and Jesse N. smith.  Mis. Memo: they signed and requested you to sign, but we are in- formed you declined to do so, thought, you had  telegraphed, upon receipt of the letter of instructions that you accepted and would be governed by the provisions of that letter and this was, and is the under= standding of the entire Council res= pecting your telegrams to Brother Brigham.  Viewing your action in  refusing to sign this memorandum submittd to you as a vioation of the Letter of instructions and a breach of faith with the Coun= cil, and a departure from your expressed agreement, the Council of the Twelve Apostles has de- cided that it could not present your ame at the Conferenc eto the people as a counsellor.  It was therefore omitted without 
 comment.  The Council has also decided that you be summon= ed to appear before it in this  City forth with to show cause why you hould not be dealt with accorning to the laws of the Church for this conduct.  You  will please accept this letter as  a summons to thus appear Please telegraph me when you will be her as the Council is waiting I remain Your Brother Signed W. Woodruff For and in behalf of the Twelve apostles

 [Pres] Woodruff    Steuben may the 17th 1849  Sir as my husband was gone from home when your pusilarimous letter arrived it fell in to my hands, and I feell it my duty however painful it may be to answer it.  I feell if I should (hold my peace the verry stones would cry out) you accuse him of intxoriaation in Philladelphia, and of pleading inocent as to his his getting intoxicated, this I know is false as them stroct told it, he has told me every circum- stance concerning his being taken by the watchman he had got fatigued and sick traveling from Pittburg in those dirity Secltion Bats that he came in, and set himself down to rest a while, (having no money to get him a lodging) he got a sleep and when the watch found him he thought he was some suspicious looking person, and for the sake of the fee which he knew he would get he took time to the wash him to the wach house notwithstanding my Husband told him he was inocent and for that reason told him who he was, and showed his papers to proove it.  But as it was the Officer prooved to be a latter Saint then those that bore the name, he gave him money to help him on his journey, for ^he^ repented of what he had done, he did not stand back as those holy brothers did but he saw he was in distress and administered to his wants.  Which do you think done the will of his Heavenly father; I suppose you know that my Husband came in company with Dudley, my Husband had money 
 Washington City Jan. 17th [18]50  Dear Brother,  Your kind favor of the 10th  was received yesterday. The intelligence from the valley is quite cheering.  The discovery of a coal  an iron are of far more value to us than a gold mine would be. Since my arrival here I have been pretty busy among grave Senators, impulsive representatives of the people, and other functionaries. Business progresses very slowly in Congress, the organ- ization of the House is not yet completed, though more than six weeks of the session have already passed. Though there is scarcely a ray of hope of our admission into the Union as a State, the prospect of our obtaining a territorial ^organization^ is far from being discouraging, and an influential Senator has given me encouragement to hope that we may be authorized to elect our own officers. Some time ago I understood that Mr Stanton of Kentucky had received a remonstrance to our memorial.  I suspect- ed its character and called to see him, he kindly favored me with a perusal of it. It charges us with a number of the foulest deeds & abominations in the dark catalogue of crimes, and is signed by William Smith and thirteen others.  Mr Stanton was very friendly, but deemed it his duty to present it in the House.  On the 31st Ult. Senator  [sideways text] The probability is that our application for a government will not be disposed of before  May or June July or August.  Dr. J. M.

 enough to have brought him along comfortable but Dudly had none therefore my husband devided with him to the last cent before he got to Philadelphia, Dudley promised to get money there and pay him, but instead of that he shiped him there, and left him without money or friends. That is a speceman of the dealings of laterday saints. but I thank my Hea^v^enly father that the time is a coming when he will meet his accusers face to face then will it be known who is the mi[s]erable slanderers' and the inocent shall then be made known, And let Orson Hide beware! God will not alway have an unriteous judge over his people, nor will those that would walk uprightly suffer persecution, Prehaps you may think I write this with some bitterness of feelling, I have reason to I have seen enough of their dealings with my Husband and I can hold my peace no longer. So long as my Husban money to give those dear brothers, and a home for then month after month it was all well enogh, but when he was reducted in his circumstances by fowllowing them west by the mob, and sickness and he had nothing more to give; then he must be cast off as not worth saveing. This looks like buying Salvation with dtoo dear a price and if we are ever saved I trust it will be with those of better principles, as to the papers you allude to I knew not that he had any if hear I will find them and burn them for they can be of little use to him, as he has to work at his trade, to support his family besides there is no-one here that heran would hear the Doctrine praeached, and I should hear to 
 Underwood of Ky. electrified the Senate by the presentation of a copy of the same remonstrance in the Senate. The honorable Senator was somewhat excited, gave a synopsis of its contents, thought the charges aught to be investigated, and moved its reference to the Committee on Territories of which he is a member. The other remonstrance was also presented in the House the same day, an abstract of which appeared in the papers the following morning, and created consider- able sensation. The same evening I called at Judge Underwood's, but he was absent, however the next morn- ing I had an interview with ^him,^ and another two or three days afterward, explained matters to him, and got him pretty well satisfied.  I also called on the Chairman of the Committee on Territories in the House, and other members,and with the review of counteracting the effect it had produced and was producing I deemed it expedient to have the enclosed article published in the Republic, the government organ and afterward called on the editors of ^the^ Union, Globe and National Intelligencer, and requested them to republish it while they did, two of them with some prefatory remarks. Immediately after this I received, and I thanked God for it, Mr Kinkead's account, and other favorable intelligence from the valley, which I have had published in the four principal papers of this city.  I omitted to mention that Mr. Underwood at the time he presented 
 what he said just as soon with out the papers, as with them.  I would never hurt my Husbands feellings by leting him see the letter you sent if he has not allready seen you as he proposed to do, ^when he^ whent away, I epect he is on his return now in a vessel that malled from this port.  God: forgive me if I say any thing amiss, but when I think how my husband was respected before he came in to this Church, in the Baptist church to which he belonged he was beloved as a member, and looked up to as one of the pillars of the church and now he must be belied by a set of misecrents that is not worthy to carry his old shoes after him, and as long as I can speak I will not hear my husband so belied as I know he has been and hold my peace, this you may tell Orson Hide on any one else.  I know how my husband was treated in St Louis by the Presideing Elder and other would be  [page torn] ask Brother E T Benson he knows my husband better than any one else and prehaps will render a more just account.  I do not blame you for I well know by whose instignation it is that you speak as you do, and I hope I shall not say anything to hurt your feellings but you must be ware how you condem an inocent man who posesses more soul than as many of those (insignificant beings I could mention) as could stand between here and the salt lake. Prehaps if my husband was here he would not allow me to write as I do but it is my first feellings from the impulse of the moment I would like to have you write to me and give me such coulnirel as you think I need and the progress of the church for I have heard nothing since I left St Louis last fall, give my love to sister woodruff for I e^s^teem her as a worthy woman ask he to write me  Yours Respectfully  Cynthia Dam 
 William Smith's memorial, he also read a paragraph from a newspaper accusing ^us^ with having arrested Gen Wilson, Pomeroy and others, and imposing a duty of 50 per cent on all merchandize brought into the  valley.  Senator Truman Smith informed me on Sat- urday evening that he had just received a letter from Gen Wilson ^who spent some time in the valley en route for California^ in which he spoke of our people in the most flattering terms, that he had really used strong language, that he had written to the President enclosing Gen Wilson's letter, and when he returned it, he would publish so much of it as relates to Deseret and its inhabitants with some remarks of his own. I shall have it immediately republished in all the principal papers of the City.  I shall send you a copy of it.  I have addressed a note to the Honorable Senator to-day, requesting him to give it publicity at his earliest convenience.  I was presented to the President some time since, and stated to him the object of my visit to Washington, his reply was, "That lies in the breast of Congress." A report has recently been in circulation to a limited extent, that the President had said at a dinner party at the White House that he would veto any bill that may be passed for the benefit of the Mormons, and I have reason to beleive that it is not entirely without foundation in truth, but notwithstanding that there will be no difficulty in that quarter I beleiieve on what I regard as excellent authority.  Col Kane was here for about a week in the begining of the

 month, exerting his influence in our behalf. Do not be surprised to learn that this Union may be shaken to its centre before the close of the present session. The South is determined that the "vexed question" of slavery shall be disposed of, and in their own way, and the North seem equally determin- ed not to yield an inch. One Southern ^Senator^ said to me not long since "ninety nine to one but the Union will be disolved" Another Southern Senator told me that  just before New Year that this question was now to be settled, and was to take precedence of all other business The South have been caucusing, but they  have not been able to agree among themselves. They can- not all be brought to unite on Mr Calhoun or on any other man as their leader. In compliance with an ivitation I visited Col Benton, who was quite friendly, and said it was clear that we aught to have a territorial government. I have also had an inter- view with Mr Calhoun who is a very agreeable and affable man, and remarked that we should have the same chance as other territories. When our memorial & consti- tution were presented in the Senate, Gen. Cass came to me and said, "I shall go for a state, your folks can manage a state as well as anybody else". William Smith's memorial has prevented me from seeing Mr Clay and Mr Webster which however I shall do very shortly. I have an excellent little trait by Brother Parley, which contains a synopsis of our faith and Doctrine, which I distribute, and preach to members of Congress and others whenever a favorable opportunity presents itself--I visit Mrs McLean, the lady of one of the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, once a week to instruct her in the principles of our faith and doctrine. She has read the Voice of Warning & Brother Spencer's Letters, with which she has expressed herself highly gratified. She is now reading the Book of Mormon, & a little work entitled the Book of Mormon proved.  She has a Spirit of inquiry, and her interest in the work is increasing.

 Washington City March 22, 1850  Dear Brother, I hope you will excuse my delay  in replying to your last favor, my time since  its reception has been very much occupied. Our application for a government over the valley of the Great Salt Lake and the adjacent region, has given me many anxious moments since my arrival in Washington. There is not a shadow of a doubt that we shall not be admitted into  the Union as a State. But the Hon Truman Smith has proposed to me a plan for a territorial govern- ment, which authorises us to elect our own officers, and the Central Government to pay their saleries. This would do admirably well, Judge Douglass has proposed a plan somewhat similar, which is to legalize our present constitution and form of government Either would entitle us to a delegate in Congress, but not Senators It is how- ever exceedingly doubtful whether Congress can be induced to grant us such a government. If we get but an ordinary territorial government, I entertain but faint hopes, from my knowledge 
 of men and measures here, that the President would nominate such officers as we would elect, and if he did the Senate would not confirm them, and if they did, they would at any moment be liable to be removed, and would almost certainly be when the present incumbent of the Presidency goes out of office. There are already hungry office hunters here  who are seeking for the offices in the event that we get a territorial government, and if some whippersnappers or broken down politicians should be sent out, who would not be accepta ble to us, to tyranize over us, we should certain- ly be brought into collison with the General Government, and if a common territorial govern ment be given us, and we should not accept it, it would be rebellion, and we should bring down upon us the indignation of the whole nation, and measures would be taken to enforce it, and it is superfluous for me to tell you what the consequences would be. For these reasons I have, after much anxious  reflection and serious deliberation, come almost to the determination, If I find that Congress will 
 not grant us such a form of government as will authorize us to elect our own officers, to withdraw our application for a government, at least temporarily, until I can see the authorities in the valley, or hear from them. We can get along very well with our provisional govern- ment, until our population is sufficient to entitle us to admission into the Union as a State, and this would be carrying out the President's wishes. Now, dear brother, I want you to [tel]l me candidly what you think of this matter, and whether I should, in your  judgment, in the absence of instructions from the valley, be warrented in adopting this course I need not add that as early an answer as you can make will be acceptable Brother Babbitt has taken his departure for the west.  Your friend John M. Bernhisel

 vallies, and from 1 to 100 in the mountains makes a hard winter; but we have lost but little stock in comparison with last year. The snow in the vallies has gone off so gradually, the ground is thorough- ly soaked 3 feet deep.  I do not know how much deeper. Spring has broke upon us mild and warm, the top of the ground is beginning to be dry, but the wells are raising.  Every kind of fruit trees; from the apple to the currant, are loaded with fruit buds, and some of the Peaches and Apricots are ready to blossom. I think it will be a fruitful year, for all kinds of fruit, grain and veget- ables. The cottonwood canal is nearly finished; it has been a great job. I expect the stone will come floating to the Temple, they are now hauling with cattle. The Temple foundation is surrounded with stone cutters who make rich sweet music. I expect after conference there will be several hundreds cutting stone, and the Temple will be pushed.  We have had a great Reformation this winter, some of the fruits are, all have confessed their sins either great or small, restored their stollen property, all have been baptized from the Presidency down: all are trying to pay their Tithing, and nearly all are trying to get wives, until there is hardly a girl 14 years old in Utah, but what is married, or just going to be. President Young has hardly time to eat, drink or sleep, in consequence of marrying the people and attending to the endowments. I never have had so much to do in my life. I would think it would wear him out. There has hardly been a ball or party for recreation through this Territory for the last 6 months. I have attended a meeting of some kind about every evening through the past winter, & have not visited your family much, nor any body else, not among my own but little, for 5 months. I generally get to bed about 11 or 12 o'clock. I have never 
 seen this people feel the importance of living their religion as much as they have done the past winters. I hope it will continue. the power of God has been with in preaching and teaching in all the Quorums and Ward meetings. I commenced with J. M. Grant before he died, and after his death the burthen [burden] of the care of the Missionaries rested upon me and bro. F. D. Richards: who was unwell consid- erable but attended most of the time. L. Snow and O. Hyde have been with me a part of the time. The Presidency and Twelve (except my self) and about 100 others are expecting to go on a summer Trip North to Salmon river.  This Spring A. Lyman & C. C.  Rich will be with us about the first of May. I expect they will take a European mission, some missionaries will be called to Europe, and to the islands. President Young would like to send a mission to Siberia and the Japan- ese islands. The Lamanites are doing well, Arrowpeene and Kanosh with other chiefs are making great improvement. Arrow- peene preached a short discourse in the Tabernacle lately, it was good.  We have given up the Lead mines after making about 10 or 12.00 lbs. it is quite expensive and does not work as well as expected. a cotton company are called to go to the Rio Virgin. We are going to try the chinese Sugar cane this summer as far as we can get seed.  All is peace and prosperity with us throughout this Territory. some are going to California this Spring, several in the Southern settlements have started on the short roads, [or] cut off to go there, and no doubt some others will follow them soon.  Your family are all well, you and the brethren associated with you are 
 earnestly remembered in our prayers.  As far as the History is concerned, we finished matters up to the death of Joseph as far as we could; then brought up the other matters including the history of the Twelve up to the organization of the church Augt. 8. I then have taken up the history of Brigham  Young and his fathers family briefly, and now am at work on the history of the Twelve, from their first organization in a brief form, taking all that belonged to it, up to the 8 August 1844. We have no trouble now with the Gentiles here in court or anywhere else. It would amuse you to read one of the late scenes while in court filed in our office too lengthy to insert with Dr. Hurt, Gen. Burr and some smaller fry, to bullyrag all our laws and their defenders, a  part of them came armed with colts, revolvers, it ended in T. S.  Williams resignation and Gen. Burr's dismissal from the Bar; and some others who intended to use the pistols went out of the house in the form of a sled using the seat of their honor for run- ners, dropping their loaded weapons while going out, which they never afterwards found. all has been quiet since, having but little lawing on hand.  Please not expose my succatash letter to the press, for I write for your own benefit and amusement, not guarded as I would while writing to men who publish papers.  Gen. Burr has written to the department as we are informed, accusing us of cutting off and wasting the government timber in the Kanyons. I expect he will have an invitation this Spring  of going to the upper mill in big cottonwood kanyon, and taking a ride down to Jordan on the top of a big pine log, (if he can stay on the top of it) and when he has finished his trip, if he thinks it will not cost all it is worth to get it, we will pay to Government all that is over, leaving him to be the judge.  Yours truly W. Woodruff 
 OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  P. O. Box, B.  Salt Lake City, Utah. May 22, 1893.  TO THE PRESIDENTS OF STAKES THROUGHOUT ZION,  Dear Brethren:  We deem it desirable and also consistent with the promises made to the Saints that a record be opened in which will be written the names of all who have contributed by way of donations towards the erection of the Salt Lake Temple, with the amount that each one has given. The name of no person, no matter how young, nor how small the amount subscribed, should be omitted. We shall be pleased to have you forward to this office a list of donors belonging to your Stake at as early a date as practicable giving the full name and address of every giver, with the correct amount placed opposite each name.  We are particularly desirous of obtaining particulars of those who have donated for this purpose since the laying of the cap-stone (6th April, 1892), but would also like your report to go back as far as possible and contain all amounts paid, including the fifty cent monthly donations, no matter how long ago they were received. We prefer that the names in these lists should be arranged alphabetically, but if this is inconvenient, the report can be made out by wards, with the names in each ward placed in alphabetical order.  With kindest regards, we remain, Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. Smith 
 President Woodruff - Then addressed the congregation.  Said he felt thankful to his Heavenly Father that he had lived long enough to speake to so many people in Provo.  The Saints must not expect too much of an old man, as he with all the Servants of God, was dependent upon Him for all he done. He had lived in the history of this Church some fifty six years, and it was a marvel to him that he still lived considering all that the Church had passed through, but this is Gods work, and He will uphold it, and His servants who will obey Him. Bore his testimony that God had restored the Holy Priesthood in this dis- pensation, and that He will accom- plish His work according to the words of His inspired servants.  Showed that the work and people of God had always been opposed by the inhabitants of the earth: showing also the awful consequences upon the nations who have, and who will shed the blood of the Lords anointed. He desired the 
 1889 March 4th  the year 1888, was read. President Wilford Woodruff Addressed the Conference.  Said we heard this morning from Brother Cannon some things which are of great importance and comfort to the Latter-day Saints, and we should treasure them up. Spoke of the manner the Gospel was restored to the earth in this dispensation, through the youthful Prophet Joseph Smith, showing that his name was had for evil among the nations of the earth the same as that of the Savior was in His time. Showed the great work that God had accomplished through the instrumentality of the great Latter-day Prophet and his associates.  The speaker then read Section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants and desired it impressed upon the minds of the Lat- ter-day Saints. He then showed how the judgements of the Lord had been dealt out to those that had afflicted His Saints nevertheless the Lord will chasten His children from time to time, until they serve Him acceptably.  He called upon all the Saints to go before the Lord, in humility, and pray for those things which they need and which Zion needs: for we will have many severe trials to pass through, and all will need strength from the Lord.  He exhorted the Saints to receive and carry out in their lives, the counsels given them in this Conference and be earnest and sincere in keeping the com- mandments of God; and prayed for the blessings of God to rest upon the con- gregations of the Saints. 
 Saints to understand that we are passing through an experiences all of which is in fullfillment of Gods purposes, and warned the people not to follow after the things of this world, for they will fail them; but it will pay them to be united, and strive to keep the commandments of God, up- holding and sustaining His work.  He especially exhorted the Saints in Utah Stake to be united, as he felt they needed this exhortation. 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff Refered to the revelations given to St John, as giving the history of the world from his time down to the end of the world, making manifest the judgements of God which will be poured out upon the wicked, also showing that the Gospel of Christ would be restored through the manifestations of angels.  Bore his testimony that the Gospel has been restored, to the Latter Day Saints as was portrayed and they occupy a much different position in the world from the rest of man kind and therefore they should walk uprightly before the Lord and keep all His commandments that our fellow men seeing our good works will glorify our Father in Heaven 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff Expressed his astonishment at the small assembly of the Saints which had coneved this morning especially when Provo alone could fill the Buiding to overflowing if they people would turn out. Said he walked 30 miles in winter time to attend meeting where he could meet the Elders of the church and thought if these Saints could only realize what was before them and the importance of the work they would have been out to hear the Brethren of the Priesthood. 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff, Said Brother Joseph F Smith had given the correct pattern in which the affairs of the Priet- hood are [chosen],  the one ordained  and appointed of God, and before the conference closes the Saints will have Know who the Lords wants to fill the Presidency of this Stake.  He desired to speak upon principles connected with this work we do not understand our true relat- ionship to God, and to each other, spoke of his-feelings and prayers regarding the work of God, in his youth for he was convinced the the minsters of the time were unauthorized to admin- ster the ordinances of the Gospel of Christ.  Refered to his early exper- ences.  And acquaintance with the Prophet Joseph Smith, and his Brother Hyrum and he knew.  they were instru- ments in the hands of God. to establish this great work; God is with this people, and He will not punish^ermit^ any man to lead this people astray. There- fore the saints can set their hearts at  rest on that point. He invocked the Blessings of God upon this people and upon all Israel that they may understand their true relationship to God and to echach other and this work 
 Prest Woodruff Refered to his experience in the early history of this church, showing the great obstacle^cles^ which the Saints and especially the leaders of the Church had to contend with and overcome and many more were overcame by the adversary of all truth. Showed that the same po^e^rsons and influences are still laboring to over come and destroy this work and it [Chases] the Saints to become more fermly united in this great work, and labor for the salvation of the human race, and the establishment of the Zion of our God.

 Apostle Wilford Woodruff was pleased to meet with the Saints on this Conference. Felt like saying what the Lord whgave him whether it be much or little. He felt that the Gospel is as good to day as when first revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I some times think said that speaker, "that the Elders in Israel forget who they are and what their destinies ^are^. God us to bear off this work in triumph. He said we have no time to sell or drink liquor and the time will come when a man will not be allowed to admister the sacrament  or enter into the temple, who uses either one or the other. There is no time to be lost this gospel must be preached to every nation, kindred, tongue and people befor Jesus comes in His glory. 
 Apostle Woodruff.  It has been asked some- times, when a person has been called on a mission What has he done? now we want it understood that the doctrine of Church is not to send men on missions who have committed sins, but those that have lead pure lives.  Spoke of the Elders in performing missions in the early rise of this Church; they had it to do or come under comdemnation. The speaker gave much valuable instruct- ion which was listened to with deep interest by the many people that were pres- ent. 
 The speaker asked, Has God ^gone^ a journey? "Have all those revealations been fulfilled?" What are the people aposiatizing for? "No man with the Spirit of God will turn from the truth."  The speaker earnestly exhorted the Saints to awake from their slumbers and put on the beautiful garment, to keep the Word of Wisdom, to keep the commandments of God, and repent of their sins. He dealt with pleasure upon the working of the United Order in Arizona, where he had spent his time for something more than a year.  The speaker stated that he visited many of the Lamanites in Arizona and conversed with their chief, and leading men. Found them anxious to hear the Word of the Lord and to learn something of their forefathers. They are industrious, ecanomical, and clean.

 Aleppo, Turkey Feb 21st 1894  Prest. Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother  I write you in relation to a matter that is the cause of much trouble to us here in this branch of the church. Dispensing with preliminaries and to be brief I will say that we have an Elder here by the name of Geo. A. Vizerian who is giving us much trouble as follows   In the latter part of Dec. last, while residing at Aintab in the performance of my mis- sionary labors I recieved a letter signed by all of the Saints except about three, asking me to come here (Aleppo) immediately as there was trouble existing in the church.  On my arrival here I found them to be in a sad condition. There was considerable enmity between Elder Vizerian on the one hand and the two Priests and the Saints on the other. Things had been going from bad to worse until a short time previous to my coming, when the Elder, (Vizerian would come to meeting on Sunday, administer the Sacrament and the Saints refusing to partake of it, he would say they were all damned and call them ap- ostates etc. and dismiss the services and go away.  I did not think it wisdom to enter into a judicial investigation of the matters for fear of iritating or widening the gap between them, so I appointed a meeting and after reminding them that we all had our faults and imperfections succeeded in having them all ask 
 forgiveness of each ^other^ promising to forget the past and live better in the future. I thought we had made a perma- ment reconciliation but it has proven not to be so. As I have now learned the facts I find the trouble came about in this way.  About two years or more ago, Elder Vizerian, the two Priests, and some of the Saints now here were living in Aintab. An elder by name of Garoutch was presiding over them. Elders Garoutch and Vizerian told the Saints that they were prophets, and Garoutch had a revelation, or revelations for their guidance; and he did many things that did not reflect any credit on the Latter Day Saints. Some months afterwards he (G) became insane, and some months later died a violent death. The American physicians after examination, by his convulsions etc. pronounced his death to be by poison. There seems to be some mystery concerning his death, of which Elder Vizerian knows but refuses to divulge.  The Priests and some of the Saints did not believe in the revelations of Garoutch whereupon he denounced them as apostates etc. Since Garoutchs' death Elder Vizerian denounces all who speak against him (G) and his revel- ations, especially one of the priests whom he calls a Judas, and they remained away from church.  Now that they have removed here, the troubles ar[e] renew- ed here of course. Elder Vizerian has been presiding here with the results as above stated, until my arrival. 
 He has been keeping the books, tithing etc. After our reconciliation as stated above, the saints desired and elected or sustained unanimously a brother Hagopian as clerk to keep the tithing accts etc.  When Elder Vizerian came to turn over the books and funds on hand he took his tithing and donations for several years past out of the fund and refused to turn it over. For the only man here holding the higher Priesthood to act in such a manner hurt the saints very much. To my questions as to why he did so he would only answer that he acted according to the dictates of the Spirit. I could only with much difficulty apease the indignation of the saints and I felt it my duty to say that a non-tithing payer was not in good standing or fellowship and according to Church order should not be allowed to ad- minister in any of the ordinances of the Gospel, which I have carried into effect, knowing that the saints would not recieve administrations at his hands.  For two months past we have been holding meeting three or four times a week having a little peace then turmoil alternately, caused by this elders' actions and sayings.  He comes to the meetings and sits quietly, but every opportu- nity he has he condemns the saints and prophesies that trouble will come upon them (not saying what the trouble will be) and thus keeps up an agitation that will give us no rest. Two nights ago at 12 oclock midnight he baptised two young men and administered Sacrament 
 to them etc. without my knowledge or that of the saints. When I learned of this I told him that under existing circum- stances he should not have done so, that the saints here nor myself did not approve it, to which he said "I do not care for you, the church or any man so long as God com- mands it me." When I ask him for evidence that I may know that he is commanded to do these things he only says "I bear my testimony to you that it is true: if you wish to know more ask God he will tell you."  He is an unmarried man and together with a young man named Geo. live in a house by themselves, where they have dreams and visions almost without number. From his mysterious sayings and actings actions I infer that he thinks they are those two prophets that are to come on this continent; in fact I am told that he has said so. Astounding as this statement may seem I verily believe that he considers themselves to be such, and he does not hesitate in telling me that all things are made known to them.  I say nothing against the manifestations of the Spirit for personal advancement and benifit, on the contrary I advocate it, but I understand from Doc & Cov's that he only who stands at the head of the church can recieve revelations for the church: else order would be subverted. He told me to day that he was spiritual president of the church here, I was but temporal. I was not inclined to believe, although I heard it said many times, that he 
 thought himself a prophet until I accidentally saw a copy of his letter to you dated about Jan 12 or 13th [18]94 in which he speaks of those two prophets.  He since told me several times that he expected a letter from you, shortly, which would open my eyes to things impossible to believe now and which would account for all his peculiar actions. I think you will under- stand his short, mysterious letter better after reading this. I think his letter was written to you upon the subject mentioned for your approval and confirmation. I present this case to you because he will not submit it to any lower authority, considering himself above any but yourself and agreeing to abide by your reply to his letter.  You will have perhaps have answered his letter before this reaches you. If you have understanding it fully, I hope it may settle our affairs here. If you did not understand it fully or have not yet an- swered it, I ask you to do so at your earliest convenience and let it be direct and emphatic that he may have a plain understanding of the same that we may be en- abled to establish peace and harmony, for a continuance of affairs as we have had them for the last two months or more will soon lead to the utter anihilation of this branch of the church. I ask you to answer this com- munication with all the instructions you deem it nec- essary for me to have upon this matter, or any others, also a copy toof your reply to him. 
 I ask these things only if in your best judgement and by the dictation of the Holy Ghost you see fit so to do.  I remain your brother in the Gospel of Jesus Christ  F. A. Huish.  PS. I think you know this bro. by correspondence at least.  Our church membership might have been doubled but for him, and some (especially the Priests) are remaining away from our services, and some postponing baptism because of him.  (I understand that it is informal to refer church troubles directly to yourself but as I stated he will submit it to no other, not even to the prest. of European mission promising to govern himself according to your reply) I have stated the root of the troubles only and there are many branches growing out of it. It is impossi- ble to describe the tumult and contentions we have had.  Trusting you may approve my actions I am, Resp[ec]t[fully],  F. A. H.  Are baptisms performed by elders who are not considered in good standing legal ones?  [sideways text] F. A. Huish Feb. 21 [18]94. [end of sideways text] 
 K.A. Vezirian  Aleppo, January 10, 1894.  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear brother,  Would you please to receive my Photograph and that of 21 Saints? I desire from the bottom of my heart to comminu cate you my joy in beginning to a new year with the poeple of God. I thank God and know by the power of his Spirit that that Joseph Smith is Prophet, and his revelations are true, as it is written in the book of 
 Doctrines & covenants.  The Revelator asks  What is to be understood by the two witnesses, in the 11th  chapter of Revelations?  Such it was answered   They are two Prophets that are to be raised up to the Jewish nation in the last days, at the times of restoration and to prophesy to the Jews, after they are gathered & build the city of Jerusalim in the land of their fathers.  How joyful to have faith to these words of happiness?  Another question  
 What are we to understand by the sounding of the trumpets, mentioned in the 8th chapter of Revelations?  The Answer is given as you read Section 77. & 12 Verse.  I Raise God with power & spirit he has bestowed upon me, because the spirit knows the sixth Angel, having autherity to ordain eldesrs, one for destruction and one for salvation.  I ask your prayers for me that I ever remain your brother in preaching the Gospel of Christ.  Kevork. A. Vezirian 
 P.S. I hope Elder Frederick Stanffer will give or send to you this letter and the Photo. of 21 Saints, taken in Aintab, 1891. K. A. V.

 To First Presidency etc   Thanks be to God for ever for  the great favor you have be- stowed upon an humble brother  and a sinner like me, in helping  me first to obtain a Diploma and  secondly to return to my home I amshall be for ever Thankful  to you. Notwistanding that the  Seas are not calm (safe) in the  month of March, I am obliged to  go now first to cavoid unneccessary  expense and secondly to get away  from this cold place  I disire that you would paray to  God especially to heal me of my  sickness and also that I may arrive  home in safety and prosper me in 
 my labors that I may show my  gratitude for the great favors the  Church has bestowed upon, by  doing some little service for my  Church and my bretheren.  I feel regret that I was not  permitted to enter the Temple nor to receve a portion of the  Priesthood in Zion, so that  if I should die I would have  been anointed and been in  the Temple. It seems that God  did not see fit this time; but  if I live and God permits me  I shall come with my family. Perhaps the Lord did not open the  way this time that I might constantly  desire to bring my family to Zion  I belive that gGod will permit 
 me to see that day. I also disire you to pray for me that this may be so.  I received your telegram on Sunday Mar 10th and today I received the money and I shall get my ticket and leave on the 330 train this afternoon for Brooklyn. I intend to leave on the steamer on Sunday.  Having nothing more to say I remain Your Brother in Christ  A. D. S. Habian

 Provo City, June 12  [18]89  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In conformity with Circular No. 4, and given Notice of the Secretary of the General Board of Education, the three appointed Examiners met with the Graduates for Normal Certificates, at the B. Y. Academy, Provo, Monday, May 27, at 9 A.M. Sixteen, that is 14 gentlemen, and 2 ladies, reported. There were two more who had previously announced their in- tention to graduate, but one was taken ill, and the other was prevented from attending by a death in the family. It had been decided by the Board of Examiners to have the first three days devoted to the written examination, and the questions, (copies of which are herewith enclosed to be placed on file by the Secretary G. B. S.,) which had been previously submitted by each one of us to the Board of Examiners for approval, were placed successively on the Blackboard, and were worked out by the Graduates under my own supervision. Every answer received its percentage, the total of the whole set making the total of efficiency in that respective branch together them with the total in the practical and oral examination in the same study. A Graduate considering himself as 
 by any of the Examiners in any one point, should have the right of asking for an explanation, and if then not satisfied, of an appeal in the case to the Board of Examiners. Several explanations have been asked, which, however, proved satis- factory in every instance, and no appeal became necessary. It had been decided that in case of the Percentage in General Efficiency should fall^ing^ below 60, no Certificate should be issued. This occurred only in the case of Michael Barclay, 49%. That man is absolutely unqualified for a teacher; his answers in Grammar, Theory of Teaching, and Geography, seem almost to indicate a partially unsound mind. When he reported his intention to me to graduate, I cautioned him privately, but he is so full of his own conceit that nothing could con- vince him of his incapacity. He only attended the Acade- my one term some years ago, failing them entirely. I have also notified all Graduates that fell below 75% in any one branch to pass another examination in that par- ticular branch next ^under one^ year, until they reach an efficiency of at least 75%. During Thursday and Friday each one of us three held oral and practical examinations simultaneously in separate rooms, having a class 
 of schoolchildren (30 in number) divided between us for that purpose. Saturday morning we spent in consul- tation and arranging the statistics of our Examination. The results of which have been put into the hands of the Secretary in the form of a Schedule. As there may be cases presenting themselves during the summer, or the next school- year, of persons soliciting examination; we have proposed, therefore, that any one of us three, residing or being in the region of country of said person, might be commissioned by the chairman of Examiners, upon due application having been made in time, to hold that examination, each one of us furnishing the questions pertaining to this department. If this arrangement should meet your approval, our work may be facilitated considerably in such cases.  As the B. Y. Academy commences Aug. 5, and you have given me the privilege to remain with that institution the first 10 weeks for the purpose of organizing and starting the Normal Department in conformity with the requirement of Circular No. 4, I shall be at liberty to travel wherever you should desire me to go, on or after October 11 or rather October 4 already, the tenth 
 week being Conference week. I should desire to visit the northern Stakes, where churchschools are, during the hotter season and take the South during the fall and winter, if possible. As President Geo. Q. Cannon has granted me the privilege to have my name retained as Principal of the B. Y. Academy for the next year, I shall draw up the Circular for that institution, meet with the newly organized Stake Board, and make with them such ar- rangements as the interests of the institution maty re- quire during the protracted periods of my absence after the first ten weeks. By a private letter from Bro. Benj- Cluff, now at Ann Arbor, I learn, that he is inclined to come home at once, if his services would be required and a suitable salary could be promised him. It does not seem wisdom to me to make any more assurances and promises of definite position or salary before en- tering the churchschool-service, which step should al- ways be taken by the candidate bonafide, nor could we venture to place any man into s such a responsible position as the Principalship of the B. Y. Academy is, nor in on coming directly from the East, before we have 
 ascertained to what extent his spirit and methods have been influenced by his eastern sojourn. I h Thus, I think, Bro. Cluff might work himself into it as my deputy during my periods of absence, until he can take it all. That was partly the course Bro. Tanner pursued after his return home and before going to Logan. In other respects Bro. Cluff would be preferable for that position to anyone else I know of. I also understand that the authorities of Bear Lake Stake have made ouvertures to Bro. Cluff; to be the Principal of their Academy. These Bear Lake people have done so many queer things educationally and  otherwise that I do not wonder at that course so much at variance with the instructions contained in the Circulars. The next four weeks will have to be spent most- ly at my office in order to have everything arranged in order by July 15th, when the Records should all be straight, and the annual Report to the General Board be made. The remaining three weeks, at least a portion of it, I hope to use for some much needed recuperation in the mountains.  With constant prayers for your welfare I remain  Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser 
 Provo City, July 17 89  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  The telegram of Bro. Reynolds, concerning those Stakes that have not yet secured Principals was just received. In answer I report as follows: Bannock  Stake Academy at Rexburg has not reported, but it is presummed that Bro. Spori with his Assistant, Bro. Nielson, will continue, although the former is just now on the Underground in consequence  of the unfortunate test oath trouble. To Cassia Stake Board I have written today in answer to Bro. Thos. E. Harper's letter  sent to me by Bro. Reynolds and among other points sugges- ted to them the name of Bro. Geo. Cole, who graduated this spring before the Board of Examiners and lives in that Stake. Oneida Stake Academy at Franklin has not yet re- ported nor has asked for a successor to Bro. Cornwall, retired on account of ill health. Bear Lake Academy at Paris has not reported. Box Elder Stake Academy has no Principal and does not know how to pay one as they say. I have transferred Bro. Jos. J. Anderson from there to Sevier Stake Academy at Richfield, and Bro. Hayes, resigned on account of taking a course in the Sciences. 
 Office General Board of Education. April 4, 1889.  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In compliance with your letter of March 2nd, instruc- ting me to visit the Stake Academies at Salt Lake, Logan, Brigham, and Ogden, I started on the thus appointed circuitvisit Thursday, March 21, and have the honor to submit herewith and subjoined re- port of the work assigned me.  All necessary appointments in regard to my in- tended visit having been made with the respective Stake Boards and Faculties, and having placed my- self at their disposal for any good they might think I could do while with them, for the cause of true edu- cation, I met with the Salt Lake Stake Board of Education, Thursday, March 21, at 8 P.M. President Angus M. Cannon presiding, all members of the Board, and the Principal, Prof. Talmage, present.  During the progress of the meeting, a petition of this Stake Board to the General Board was called up again and read. The Secretary stating that it ^had^ had been duly forwarded a long time ago but no answer had been returned. The purport of the petition was the suggestion, upon the advice of the church-attorneys, that the General Board should take at once proper steps to in corporate the Stake Board of Education, as many very important property questions were involved. It was also stated that difficulties had arisen in regard to the name of their Academy, and a majority of the members seemed to favor the name of Brigham Young Academy, to assure 
 continued.  Bro. Barnes, Chairman of the Kaysville Local Board of Education, wrote to me applying for a Principal for their "Academy". I have answered him, that I supposed the Board of Education for Davis Stake had  fully approved of their organization this being the case, the name of Bro. Allison, their heretofore district school teacher, so he is an entire stranger to me, and whom they desired for their Principal, should be presented to the Stake Board also for approval. If on their requested, that Bor. Allison should write a letter of application to me signifying his intention to enter the Churchschool- Service, which letter should be accompanied by a Bishop's Certificate of his standing in the Church, a Certificate of Efficiency of his Normal training from wherever he had graduated, and any testimonials for his practiced labor as a teacher which he may have. Then I should notify him when and where to report for his examination by a Representative of the Board of Examiners, in order to obtain a Certificate without which he could not assume the duties of that office. Davis Stake Academy in Farmington has correspon- 
 the benefits of certain bequests. The members ex- pressed themselves much satisfied with the labors of the Principal of the Academy and of his Associates.  Friday, March 22nd. I attended the classexercises of the  Salt Lake Stake Academy, in Theology, Grammar, Arithmetic, Physics, and a General Theological Class in the afternoon. If the unappropriateness of the premises of this institution for educational purposes, par- tially over some by many clever makeshiftarrange- ments, would only be the cause of some inconve- nience for teachers and students, this circumstance would be entitled to but a passing remark in my present report, but ventilation as well as light are so defective that the health of the students, in spite of  the great caution and vigilance of the Principal, is continually endangered. Although the exceeding- ly narrow stairs caused some crowding of students during changes of classes, the discipline and order- in the general management of the exercises deserves honorable mention. The students seem interested in their studies, their answers were bright and readily given, and their written work very commendable. I found the Daily Programme judiciously arran- ged, and the Plan of Studies carefully followed by the teachers. In the Faculty meeting at the close of the school in the afternoon, the reports of the Principal and teachers showed to me a united fand harmonious feeling in spirit and method of teaching. The general prospects of this Academy, intellectually and spiritually are exceedingly en- couraging. Although the singing of the Academy 
 continued  ded with me about a Principal. I proposed to them the name of Bro. Joshua Greenwood as Principal, who has since then visited there and the preliminaries for his engagement has already been made, pending the fixing of his salary, he demanding $800. I do not think this organization of a seperate "Academy" at Kaysville in so small a Stake a wise move. A secondary school as a feeder for their Stake Academy, should have been a better plan. I am afraid there is local jealousy at the bottom of it, and it forebodes no good for the educational interests of that Stake. The 18th Ward L. D. S. School has proposed Bro. David R. Allen as Principal, and Miss Mattie Snow as Lady Teacher. I have submitted that case to the S. L. S. Board and they write that they had no objection to Bro. Allen, provided he complies with the regulations for churchschool-teachers, set forth in Gen. Circ: No. 4. I have written Bro. Allen in the same manner, as I required Bro. Allison at Kaysville to do. With Randolph, Morgan, and Coalville arrangements for the continuance of their former Principals have 
 Choir was creditable, the vocal art of Singing has not yet recieved that attentionin this institution which its importance demands, and the engagement of a Singing teacher for next schoolyear should form a point of earnest consideration for the S. L. S. Board. I regret that I had no opportunity to make the aquaintence of this lady teacher, Ms. Mattie Hughes, and ^therefore could not^ confer with her concerning her labors among the female students.  The S. L. Stake Board have made great efforts in preserving scientific apparatus and many valuable recommendations for the benefit of the Academy. By special request I delivered a lecture before the Students' Society that Friday evening, which was well attended.  Saturday, March 23rd I arrived in Logan at noon, and was informed at my arrival that I was expected to lecture that evening before the Polysophi- cal Society of the B. Y. College. The subject having been previously agreed upon. Although scarcely recovered ffrom a severe spell of sickness, and suffering under the affects of a cold I endeavered to perform that duty to the best of my ability, and was rewarded with a very appreciative audience. Sunday, March 24, I attended the Missionarymee- ting of the Collegestudents in the forenoon, and cannot express myself warmly enough in com- menting upon the Spirit pervailing in that meeting, manisfesting itself in the singing, prayers, and testimonies of the young people. After attending divine service in the afternoon I spent the remainder of the day in conversing 
 continued  been made. I understand that Tooele Stake has  erected a fine Academy building at Grantsville, and that they desire Bishop Wm. Collett one of my dear old Graduates, to be the Principal. But neither they nor he have mentioned anything to me about it. Bro. Wootton, Chairman of the Wasatch Stake Board has conferred with me in person and in writing, sta- ting that they are vigorously striving to have everything ready by October 2 for opening. We promised to meet again and I am waiting for his communication in order to make a suitable selection for a Principal, as for various reasons a very careful choice for that Stake has to be made. Springville L. D. S. High School is without a Principal; Bro. Simon Eggertson the for- mer occupant of that position, having been called to the position of Bishop's Counsellor in the II Ward, Provo, will goin teach the District school in that Ward by general request. The Local Board have not yet ap- plied for a successor hoping to persuade Bro. Eggertson to remain with them. Ephraim and Filmore Academies retain their Principals like 
 with the Principal and some teachers of the College about the affairs of their institution in order to obtain as thorough an information in regard to their station as words could convey. Monday, March 25, was devoted entirely to witnessing the class- exercises, in Theology, Rhetoric, Grammar, Mathe- matics, Geography, Reading, Theory of Teaching, General History, and Penmanship. Although only the Principal, Prof. Tanner, and one of his teachers, Bro. Todd, are Graduates of our [Normal] Academy, and, therefore, thoroughly posted in regard to our method and system of teaching, it was very gratifying to ob- serve the readiness with which especially, their  the teachers of Mathematics, Bro. Kerr, has identified with himself with the new plan of teaching.  The premises and accomodations of the College are excellent both in regard to senitary as well as disciplinary arrangement. The Ladies' Depart- ment, comprising ^also^ a Library and Readingroom, in charge of Mrs. Jennie Tanner, constitute a promi- nent feature in this institution. In Music, both instrumental and vocal, the B. Y. College stands ahead of any of the institutions in our Church- schoolorganization, and I commend Bro. H. Wahl- strom as a Music teacher of highmerits. The Vocal Art should raise great attention throughout our Churchschoolorganization, and I should suggest to the General Board to make this branch of study an object of special recommendation in the next Circular. Since the appointment of Prof. Tanner as Principal, the B. Y. College has 
 continued  Logan, Salt Lake, and Provo. There is, however, a circumstance arising in Mt. Pleasant, which I have to report to you. Some time ago, Bro. C. N. Lund, of that place, wrote to me for instructions in regard to the estab- lishment of a L. D. S. school in that there as an offset to the sectarian schools which they are ifflicted with. I told him to apply to their Stake Board for permission to organize and then I should take pleasure in assisting them to the best of my ability. It appears, however, that President Peterson is afraid that a local institution at Mt. Pleasant will interfere with the development of their Stake Academy at Ephraim, and refuses his consent. There is now ^[being]^ at Mt. Pleasant, Bro. Geo. Chris- tensen, who graduated with the highest honor this spring before the Church Board of Examiners. He taught formerly a Grammar School at Mt. Pleasant, is a favorite with the people, and carries an enormous influence with the young people. They are now afraid that I will call that young man away and give him a prominent position in one of  our Academies, and implore me not to make 
 undergone a very thorough reorganization in order to bring it more into line with our another church- schools, a change, which naturally should suggest a corresponding retardation in the regular and accustomed advancement of the students. It gives me great pleasure, however, to state, that the general- ity of the students not only seem to be reconciled to the new regime, but appear to have entered into the spirit of it with vim and delight.  By mangement, Bro. Samuel Cornnell, Princi- pal of Oneida Stake Academy, at Franklin, Idaho met me at Logan, and I learned from him following points of interest concerning his Academy: His health has been greatly im- paired by overtaxing himself. He had only a lady teacher to assist him, who was not acquain- ted at all with any systematic way of teaching. He had no maps, charts, or any utensils of con- sequence to assist him in his labors, and no apparatus of any kind. Over 100 students in atendance.  He gave a public examination which was highly commended upon. The peculiar situation of the Saints in his neighbor- hood has had a depressing effect upon this new educational enterprise at present. He is worn out, intends resigning at the end of the present term, and take another years's Normal Course as a Postgraduate. 
 continued  any appointment for him, until they would write again, trying in the meantime to get Pres. Peterson's con- sent. I should plead this cause before you, that you might assist them by your counsel. Bro: Allen R. Cutler, Principal of Panguitch Stake Academy writes, that the Stake Board there has concluded to keep their Academy only 30 weeks per year, and that they would pay him monthly at $7500. Bro. Cutler is not willing to continue under such conditions as he wants to be employed for the whole year, he rather will go to the Academy at Provo and study the higher courses I wrote Bro. Allen with the request to submit my letter to that Stake Board also, stating that Pres. Woodruff did not approve of limiting the school year to such an extent, and that I had no Principal that would be willing to accept position under such a condition. We expected our teachers to be employed all the year round, will not to be compelled to travel around the country as bookagents, serving [machine agents etc.] a [portion] of the year to make a living, or keeping strolling 
 In meeting with the Faculty of the B. Y. College, on Mon- day afternoon, I found the Daily Programme ju- diciously arranged, the progress in the exercises re- gistered weekly, and the plans and instructions of the Principal conscientiously observed. A con- traction in the number of instructors for next schoolyear seems to be desired, and Bro. Apperly, who is also County Superintendent of Distr. Schools, intends to retire from the College. On account of the absence of most of the members, a meeting of the Stake Board of Education could not be held, but it was suggested by Bro. Geo. W. Thatcher, that the members of that Board could meet at Salt Lake during Conference. The title of College for this institution is at yet somewhat inappropriate, but the facilities of the school are so excellent, that by judicious management the Collegestatus may be obtained within a comparatively short time. I arrived at Brigham City, Tuesday, March 26 at 2 P.M. and was hospitably recieved and entertained by Apostle Lorenzo Snow. A meeting had been appointed in the Tabernacle in the evening, in which by request I addressed the congregation on the objects of our churchschoolorganization in gener- al and ^of^ the Box Elder Stake Academy in particular. The fornoon of the following day was devoted to attending the class exercises at the Academy used to meeting with the Faculty at the consultation. The Faculty had consisted of the Principal, Bro. Jos. J. Anderson and three Assistants, of whom two however, have retired on account of the contraction 
 from place to place, term after term, or year after year, teaching after a fashion, taking root no where, benefitting nobody, and accomplishing nothing. last week until last Monday I was in Beaver for a "rest". My son Reinhard has concluded to remain another year as Principal. I met twice with the Stake Board, and procured them an Assistant Teacher in the person of Bro. Daniel Beck, and of our last Spring's Graduates. The Academy will occupy the so called II Ward Meeting house until after the end of the September term of the District Court by Nov. 1 when the new Court house is to be occufined and the old promisses of the Academy will be vacated. Kanab Stake Board will be ready by October and will write again for a Principal, when all arrangements have been per- fected. I ahve been compelled to recall Bro. Oscar  Vance from the District school at Parowan, and to send him to Ogden at Assistant to Bro. Moench. Bro. Vance being one of our most intelligent church school teachers will be an indispousable acquistitive to the Weber Stake Academy at Ogden. This move being 
 of the Programme to suit the reduced number of attendance. The Principal as well as his Assistent, Ms Sadie Tanner, are working by a carefully de- vised Daily Programme, are following closely their laid out Plan, and register their weekly labors acording to instructions. Several classes had to be reconstructed at the beginning of the present term on account of the change of teachers, but it was gratifying to note the readiness with which the students had accommodated them- selves to the new classification. This is the first, or experimental year of this Academy and, like all new enterprises, has to establish its reputation more corresponding influence. The good begin- ning made will furnish the institution a fair starting for the next academic year. Bro. Anderson, being a young man, has needed sev- eral times kind words of encouragement to arouse him from a growing despondency in regard to the work assigned him. A very interesting Board-  meeting was held the previous afternoon, which was attended by Pres. Lorenzo Snow, the Principal, all the members of the Board but one, and by myself. The Principal complained of lack of ap- paruyus, maps, and books, of sufficient prepar- ation of students on entering the Academy, and the frequent changes of the teachers. The members of the Board expressed sucessively their satisfac- tion with the teachers and their determination to advance the interests of the Academy. The Board intends to enlarge the premises and the [illegible] 
 the number of classrooms for next schoolyear. The prospects of this institution are bright and there is no doubt that the people of the Stake will pat- ronize ^the institution^ in future to a great extent. Wednesday, March 27, I started in arrived with the afternoon train at Ogden, where I was cordially received by President Shurtliff, and conveyed to his house; to recuperate before the meeting of the Stake Board in the evening. My health being some- what impaired. The meeting of the Stake Board of Education, President Shurtliff presiding, was held in the Courthouse and was attended by all the members. The amount of tuition formed a great part of the discussion,  as it had to be fixed very  low in consideration of the peculiar sitution of educational affairs in Ogden. They have accom- modation just now for about 1575 students, and have three rooms at their disposal. The necessity of a schoolbuilding of their own was declared to be very urgent, and Pres. Shurt- liff intimited that he had a scheme, although not yet fully matured, to obtain one. The em- ployment of a Ladyteacher, and of a teacher of Music was recognized as a matter of great importance. The entire schooltime on the following day from 8 A.M. until 4 P.M. was spent in witnessing the classexercises of the Academy. There was only the Principal and his first Assistant, Bro. Waldram,  in attendance; his second Assistant, Bro. E. Cutler, one of the Normal students of the B. Y. Academy 
 Bro. Smith writes in a beautiful spirit and if anything would be done for the Snowflake Acad- amy, it should be done. St. John's Academy for President David K. Udall, reports that their Principal, Bro. John W. Brown, has given great satisfac- tion. They send his Bishop's Certificate, Testimonial for service rendered, now applying for a License of the Intermediate Grade for him. These are all the Acad- mies which I have anything about.  Lady Teachers I have carried on quite an extensive correspondan- ce in regard to Lady teachers, and I think as got all the schools supplied in some way. Several places like Salt Lake City and Beaver for instances, arrange- sments have been made for ^daily^ seasonal visits of a Matren to talk with all with the girls.  Music Teachers.

 had suddenly been called to Provo to the bedside of a brother supposed to be dying. Considering that Bro. Moench has been out of practice for a number of years, his classwork, consisting thus for mostly of the intermediate grade, is very satisfactory, and some points which I called his attention to will by strict observance, facilitate his labors greatly in future. Bro. Waldram is what may be called a teacher of the old school, whose methods of teaching will scarcely harmonize for a great length of time with the rest of the Faculty of this Academy. The Primary Grade was conducted by one of Bro. Moench's Normals in a mattnner highly credi- table for this young beginner, especially as he conducts his classes only temperarily during the absence of Bro. Cutler, who has since returned to Ogden. I addressed in the evening a large audience under the auspices of the Polysophical Society of the Weber Stake Academy, and started Friday, March 29, in the morning with the train for Farmington, where I had been re- quested to attend the monthly Priesthoodmee- ting of that Stake on the establishment of a Stake Academy. President Smith presiding. By request I laid the aims and workings of our Churchschoolorganizative before the bretheren. The importance of ladyteachers, and the cultiva- tion of Singing was [duelled] upon also at some length. Bro. Barnes of Kaysville reported the organization of a local Board of Education

There have been recieved here such reports and of three Academies thus far, and a Summary, there- fore, cannot be made as yet. I discover that my personal visits to all those institutions will  be necesary in order to get everything gradually into shape. The most of the Stake Board of Educa- tion are [crossing] in the [desk] as it [was], this thing is so new to them, and the Principals are mostly young men, reluctant to make themselves two {START HERE} comspiment by happening ingagin in those matters  All my returns from Beaver, last Tuesday morn- ing I found such a pile of letters waiting for me that it will take several days hard work to dispose of them.

 at his place, and submitted plans and front elevation for a churchschoolbuilding. I called the attention of these bretheren to the very elaborate outside of the building; the great cost of which could only be met with under our present  circumstances at the expense and to the loss of far more important and useful items inside, as for instance apparatus, library, utensils, cabinets, and laberatories [etc.] After the Priesthood meeting, the Stake Board of Education met, and we discussed and rectified a plan for the Stake Academy. That same morning returned to Salt Lake City, and thus close this circuitvisit  There are several pionts of a general nature that have been brought out during this circuitvisit in my conversations with members of Stake boards and Faculties.  1. That only teachers be employed by Stake Boards that hold a Certificate in this for a Pri- mary, Intermediate, or Academic Teacher, issued by the General Examining Board.  2. The difference in the grades of a among our Church Academies is so wide, that ^a^ well defined grade should be established for each, until changed by order of the General Board.  3. Lady Normals should generally be trained for Primary, Ladies Work, and Music.  4.

 Provo, November 24. [18]88.  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  Since my last letter of the 3rd inst. to you the work in our church- school-organization has been going on at an increasing ratio, and consider it my duty to make a short summary report to you as far as I have been able to obtain information. As until the times of the issuing of Circular No. 2, my intercourse with the various Academies was confined to [illegible] occasions when I was either instruc- ted by you to write to certain parties, or my assistance was so- licited by Stake Authorities or Teachers themselves, a systemat- ic operation of all our existing schools, tending to a harmo- nious blending of all our labors to a common end, could not very well be attempted, without the appearance of of- ficiousness on my part, which very suspicion would do more harm than any possible good could have been gained by premature overanxiety. But your Circular, putting affairs at once into proper shape, enjoins simply upon me the duty to inform myself to some extent in regard to the spirit, condition, and results of every church- school, and to labor with the end in view, that every school of our organization feels itself as a constituent part of a 
 Provo City, June 29, 89  President Wilford Woodruff. Dear Brother,  Referring to a passage in my letter of the 24th inst. to the Secretary Bro. Geo. Reynolds in regard to Bro. Joshua Green- wood whom I had suggested as Principal of the Box Elder Stake Academy, versa Bro. J. J. Anderson resigned, I beg leave to make following additional reports: Bro. Greenwood, being a man with a family, and naturally anxious about any disposition to be made of him in the church school ser- vice, wrote to me about some decision. I did quiet him until I should receive an ^answer^ from President Clawson of Brigham City to my letter of inquiry. Thatis answer ar- rived this morning but leaves me in the dark as much as ever, at least as far this Academy is concerned.   Bro. R. Clawson states in the first place, that they should like to know to what extent the General Board will assist them, and then, what amount Bro. Greenwood desires as salary. In the second place he says, if the General Board would pay the Principal's salary, the Stake Board could meet the other obligations such as providing for assis- tant teachers, running expenses viz. viz.; otherwise they

I submit, herewith a few points, intended to be communicated to the various Principals for report, so that I can make a summary report to you previous to next April Conference.  Suggestive Points to the Academy Principals. 1. Give full name, Priesthood, Graduating, and Curriculum, Age, and Salary of every teacher, whether regular or Specialist. 2. When was your Academy organized? 3. Give names of successive Principals, and ^names of^ teachers under each. 4. Which department does your Academy consist of? 5. Make a general report about the condition of your promises, furniture, and utensils. 6. What is the condition or prospect of your Laberatory, Cabinet, Library, and Scientific apparatus? 7. Do you hold regular faculty meetings with Minutes on record? 
 2. continued  could not see their way through. Thirdly, that they had paid Bro. Anderson $60000; 1/2 Cash; 1/4 Mdse; 1/4 Tithing which arrangement had been of considerable benefit to the Academy. As points 2 and 3 hinge on the outcome of point 1, no definite idea presents itself to my mind upon which I could formulate a proposition to Bro. Green- wood, who wants to make his arrangements before  the opening of the school year.  There is a great deal of crowding upon me just now going on by many of the teachers that have not  yet been disposed of, "to know what their disposition is to be, as the district schools are after them with enticing propositions. I wish these Stake Boards would hurry up their reports, in regard to their wants of Principals and Teachers, that I could dispose of them. I am afraid, that when all available teachers have secured positions for themselves, we in the church- school-service have to take what is left, instead of having the first choice.  With constant prayers for your welfare I remain Your brother in the Gospel. Karl G. Maeser 
 continued.  8. Do you keep your Register of Studies, Term Record, and Annual Record? 9. Please to furnish me a copy of your Plan and your Daily Programme. 10. What dates are your Public Examinations? Please to instruct me in regard to these or other points of a similar nature you should desire to have attended to.  As the B.Y. Academy has now reached the number of 326 registered students and still more coming, and in addition to this, Bro. N. L. Nelsen, one of my principal teachers has been prevented from being at his post on ac- count of dyphtheria in his family with no prospect of speedy recovery, my labors have multiplied greatly upon me, and prevent me, therefore, from visiting occasional- ly one or the other of those Academies just now, al- though quite a number of them are constantly asking me to come.  Bro. Nephi Savage, at St. George seems to be getting on nicely and reports enthusiastically about his labors.  Reinhard Maeser, in Beaver, at my advice has 
 Provo, November 29 88  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  According to your instructions, received this morning per letter from Bro. Reynolds, I have written to President Crosby at Pan- guitch, that Bro. Allen R. Cutler had arrived here from his mission last Monday, and occupied himself with taking notes and getting posted in regard to organizing and conduc- ting that new Academy, ^and that^ he will start at once south, and telegraph from Milford when he expects to reach Panguitch, when it would be desirable to meet at once with the Stake Board of Education for the purpose of arranging matters. I explained to Bro. Crosby the unavoidable cause of delay which has caused them so much disappointment.  Bro. Olaf Larsen has started for Woodruff to take charge of their churchschool, and Bro. A. N. Tolestrup started this morning for Morgan City, to open that Ac- ademy, Dec. 3.  In my last report to you I neglected, as I find in reperusing the copy, the Oneida S. Academy at Franklin. that Academy has been increasing considerable in num- bers also, and have engaged a lady-teacher for thus

Although the people feel to sustain him, he is much discouraged for want of financial support, having to run the "Southern Utonian" as proprieter and editor to make a living, as he cannot get more than about 50% of his pay from the Academy.  Bro. Josiah Hickman, found the Millard Stake Academy, at Fillmore, almost dried up, so that he had to commence with only 10 students the first day; but he is a very ener- getic man, and expects to work up the institution soon to a living status.  Bro. Isaac Hages at Richfield, is a general favorite with the Authorities, people, and students, and his in- fluence for good among the youth in that region is very gratifying.  Bro. Alma Greenwood, at Ephraim, has opened with an attendance of over 70, and reports himself much pleased with the encouragement which he receives from the Authorities and the people of Sanpete Stake.  Bro. Simon Eggertsen, of Springville, has suc- 
 continued.  ceeded in stopping altogether the attendance of Mormon children at ther Gentile-schools, and is doing a good work in that place.  Bro. James E. Talmage, of Salt Lake, sent me at last a short report this week about the S. L. Academy. They are in an overcrowded condition, had to dismiss the Preparatory Department in order to make room for the larger students, and almost a hundred applicants had to be refused admission. This case demands serious consideration, and I should suggest, that the Bishops of Salt Lake City take this matter in hand, and organize at least four Preparatory Churchschools in appropriate parts of the city, under our super- vision.  A letter of the 22nd inst. from Bro. Ch. A. Walch, Morgan City informs me, that they have organized there also a Stake Board of Education, himself Secretary, and want a teacher to commence school on the first Monday in December. Al- though our Normal Dept. is now larger than it hever has been, 63 registered, 53 in attendance, I could select none of these students any more for such position, and

The St. George Board of Education contemplate serious- ly to erect an Academy building on the north-west corn- er of the Public Square, and have written to me for some additional suggestions regarding it.  A letter from Bro. Willard Farr, Secretary of the St. John's Stake Academy, in Arizona, arrived yesterday, asking me to send them a Principal for an Academy to be started within a month. I have no one to send this winter, as all competent teachers are engaged now.  The same answer must be given to Bishop A. Lofgreen, of St. David, Arizona, who calls for a teacher.  The B. Y. Academy has reached now the number of 331 students and more are get reported to come next week.  With kind regards Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser

Nephi Tollestrup, a former Normal- student, and just returned from a two-years' mission to Europe; had not reported himself to me for a voluntary finishing course in our Normal Sept. I laid the Mor- gan case before him and he consented to serve there this winter. I have written to Bro. Walch accordingly.  Bro. Jos. J. Anderson, at Brigham City, has just finished a very successful term, as I see from the papers, but expect to hear from him before long.  Bro. J. M.

I most sincerely apologize to you for having put you to so much trouble for an entire- ly personal affair ^of^ mine, the impropriety for so doing is now perfectly clear to me. Not knowing how to get the desired assistance, as I was under the impression, that it could have been granted as well as not, I consulted with one of the Bretheren around you, who advised me to write to you about it. In future I shall fol- low the promptings of my new feelings in such things.  By request of Pres. Budge of Bear Lake Stake, I sent Bro. Jedediah Taylor,
