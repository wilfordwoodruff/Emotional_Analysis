The follow is a synopsis of the discours FIGURES L.D.B W.B.   Elder Orson Pratt arose and said the subject  before us this morning is one that fills my mind with many reflections I think the Elders of this Church and kingdom  do not improve their time as they should but are to slow in treasure up knowledge as God has commanded us to do we shall want all the knowledge we can obtain when we go to the nations of the Earth and visit evry circle of the  learned to teach them the plan of salvation if we have improved our time we can bring forth out of the treasures of our  hearts things new and old. The subject before me  to day is the remains of Lorenzo D. Barnes and Wm Barton the question might arise what benefit could it be to those  Brethren to be brought from their Graves in a foreign  country and be buried with the saints here. I do not think it would be a great advantage to them in the Eternal world I had as lieves to be buried in Asia or Africa as with the  the Saints here as far as my Eternal interest is conserned but aside from this it is a great pleasure both to the living and  the dead to know that our bodies will be brought to Zion  from the Ends of the Earth to be laid with the saints  and then to be raised with them so that he can strike  hands with his relatives first and then with the saints instead of being thousands of miles apart and having to waft himself thousands of miles through the air to meet with his brethren. An Immortal being can take  himself up into the heavens as Jesus Christ did when he was raised from the dead He went to heaven So it might be with them. How long would it take for Brother Barnes and Burton to waft themselves to the bosom of the Church Not long whare will be the bosom of the Church in the clouds above the Earth before the wicked are diestroyed the Lord will be in the Air and all the saints with him of all generations and He will desend to earth and will bring all the  Saints with him. At what speed would the Saints travel  we are told that light is the power that governs all things if the saints travel as fast as light they would go at the  rate of 200000 miles in a second. God can go as fast as light and He has made the saints and I am led to conclude that  they can travel as fast as light for they have got to go on  missions to far distant worlds and if they did not go  as fast as light they would be a long time on their way spending  their time without doing any good if this is the case I had  as lieves lay my body down abroad as at home as it would not take more than a second to meet with the Saints I say  this to encourage the Elders who are going abroad some may  die abroad some may Seal their testimony with their  Blood. The Elders should take Heed and not break the comma- ndments of God if they were to commit adultery after   ENDENTRY receiving their Endowments they cannot be forgiven but  must be destroyed in the flesh and his spirit given to the  buffiting of Satan untill the first Resurrection How long it will be from the morning till evening I  am not able to say but after the day of redemption  He will come forth and inherit all the blessings that  were sealed upon his head no power can take them  from him If he has been sealed to any woman thrones powers Dominions or Kingdoms or any  other blessing He will inherit them to all Eternity  if they do not shed innocent Blood. The scriptures speak of these same subjects. Paul while speaking  to the Corinthian Churches speaks of delivering a certain  one to the buffiting of Satan that they may be destroyed  in the flesh that their spirits may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. we will now speak of David  who had a numerous family that was given him He finally took Uriah wife put Uriah at the Head  of the Battle and He was slain. Here He lost all right to the  celestial Glory His wives Thrones Kingdoms and Eternal   lives All had vanished He Just escapes Hell and that is all He will be a servant to somebody perhaps Uriah for  the Gods in Eternity will want servants to greece their  carriages makes crowns and Robes andc they will be Gods  and want servants. All may be capaciated to become  Gods but all will not keep the Laws whareby they  may become Gods. Peter spoke of a people who had  shed inocent Bloo and drew the Blood of the Savior they  were told to repent that they might be saved in the  day of the Lord Jesus Christ. There was a chance for them as they did not know the Priesthood or the fulness  of the gospel if they had know it they would not have  been forgiven. We will now speak of Brother Lorenzo D. Barnes He was faithful but died before he received the fulness of the gospel He had no Thrones, wives or any thing els of that kind sealed upon him what shall we  do for him any thing that we do for ourselves when we get a temple built such men will loose nothing for they will be Judged by the same laws  that we are and they have a chane either in time or Eternity to receive all we have. for all that  would have received it here will receive it there for all  men will be Judged like men in the flesh for all mankind  will have an Equal privilege there cannot be any baptism Endowments or Ordinances in the spirit world performed  but we shall be called to perform in a Temple of the  Lord all the ordinances for the dead the same as for the  living all things will be sealed to the End of all things preparitory to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ whether  they be appertaining to Thrones, kingdoms, families or anything  Els pertaining to Earth or Heaven time or Eternity. when  we fully consider our duty we shall not be at Ease in  Zion or spend our time to make farms and Houses orchards and  vineyards for ourselves alone. But we should go to work to build  up Zion and a Temple and do the great work of our God wo to them that are at ease in Zion but wake up and do the work of our God   ENDENTRY September 13, 1852 ~ Monday   Sept 13th I had a sick day but wrote some blessings    ENDENTRY September 14, 1852 ~ Tuesday   14 FIGURE I wrote a letter to J.M.

The Meeting opened by  prayer by President Orson Hyde who is president of the  Twelve Apostles. The names of the Twelve who were present  were O Hyde A Lyman  F D Richards   President Orson Hyde made some appropriate remarks upon  the rare and eventful occasion upon which we are now met  He offered up a fervent prayer and Thanksgiving to God for  his blessings that had been over us in our separation and in bring- ing us together and asked for all needful blessings to qualify us  for our futur labours untill we arive in the celestial kingdom  of God He then said he did not feel like making a long speech  but merely interchanging our harty congratulations in ackno- wledgeing the mercy and blessings of God   P. P. Pratt expressed his feelings and after happily refering  to our vast separetion and merciful reunion said this is the first  opportunity we have had of being together as a quorum  and feeling that each member has the most implicit  confidence in evry member of the quorum of the Twelve  and also in each member of the Presidency who presides over  us. I feel as though the day is not far distant when men  will stand among us in their Immortal Bodies holding the keys  of death and Hell and that Brother Joseph would say if he was among  us that we had suffered enough and that we should be numbered  among his Jewels He alluded to the great work we had to per- form, the building of a Temple andc   W. Woodruff next spoke and expressed his feelings upon the subj- ect of this meeting of the Twelve Apostles a blessing which he  never before enjoyed in his life. As he never had met   ENDENTRY with Eleven of the Twelve Apostles. He considered there had  never been but two bodies of men since the days of Adam  who had met under such peculier and interesting circumstances  and those were the Twelve Apostle with Jesus in Jerrusalem and the  Twelve Apostle with Jesus in America we know their History and works  and we know our own and they are three events of great importance  to the salvation of the world. He refered to the peculiar and strik- ing fact that there had never been a death in the quorum of the  Twelve Apostles except in the case of David. W. Patten who fel a martyr to his religion by a special request which he made of  the Lord that he might die that death. But the rest of the quorum of the Twelve have stood in the front of the battle and the danger  for the last twenty years in the midst of mobs sickness and plagues  and dangers by sea and land but still they were preserved untill the  present day in bloom and health He refered to the great prosperity and  work of the Twelve abroad among the nations and rejoiced that the  Lord had preserved them to returned from the fore cornors of the  Earth to again sit in counsel together in Zion. He had the most im- plicit confidence in each member of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles  also of the Presidency who presided over us said President Young was a Father  to the whole church   Erastus Snow next spoke and said though he was one of the youngest of the  quorum of the Twelve yet he had known the quorum from the begining  when they were first together in his fathers house He expressed his  Joy in being with the quorum and his Entire confidence in each member  of the quorum and in the Saints generally. Since his absence to Denmark  he had felt and learned how to appreciate the society at home and the brethren  and anticipated much pleasure in the association of this present winter hoped our meetings might be freequent and that we might become  much improved.   President O Hyde remarked that if we were at liberty to prophesy  it is while we are together as we are moved upon by the Holy Ghost  and if we dont fell to prophesy speak by faith and by faith it  should be fulfilled expressed his unlimited confidence in evry member  of the Quorum and of the Presidency and Prophesied in the name  of God that we should all meet and come forth in the morning  of the first Resurrection and receive our crowns in the celestial  kingdom it was confirmed by a good Amen by all the quorum   John Taylor next spoke said he glad to meet with the quorum He refered to the changes taking place among the Nation of the Earth and he  believed we were destined to soon hold a great influence among them  He had felt moved upon at times to offer at times some counsl  to sir Robert Peel and Louis Napolian and such men and tell them that  he could give them advice that would do them good He believed the  day near when the kings near would seek counsel at our hands  in the begining the Elders went out and were weak and ignorant men now  they are full of intelligence and the Nations of the Earth will feel their  influence when I am with this quorum I feel as though I was  with the Gods.   G A Smith said he was delighted on the present occasion He  rejoiced to see the union of the quorum and their disposition to do right  we dont have to feel that one of the quorum like Lyman Wight is  drawing off one way and Wm Smith commit- ing iniquity and we have to sustain him against our feelings. I have   ENDENTRY the satisfaction of believeing that each member of the quorum  is doing right and I rejoice that the quorum is able to publish the  gospel in six different Languages and to gather the people  together Hoped we should meet once a week and with the Presidency  offer our prayers. He felt a proud satisfaction of being associ- ated with 10 men which he believed to be the highest learned  best Educated and possessed the most intelligence of any man on  Earth That our circumstances were such that we were oblieged  to have the most knowledge whether we would or not. He believed  the prophesies uttered this evening would be fulfilled to the utter most  He closed with his blessings upon us.   A Lyman said he had so many things upon his mind that he knew  not what point to speak from He felt in his nature that he was  made up in the work of the Lord and he could not embrace any interest  any whare els ownly in this work. He has found out to his satisfa- ction what that love and affection for his brethren is that surpases the  love of women for he had a confidence in his quorum that was  far greater than in his wives or children for they have been  brought up in the hard school of experience and have been tried in  all things and proven to be true and I have been proven with them  and I am wedded to my quorum with all my interest I go when  I am sent and come when I am called, and so expect to continue to do  my interest is inseparably conneted with this kingdom and I trust  ever will be through time and Eternity.   C. C. Rich said those who had spoken ^met^ his feeling. He concured  in them all I am happy in the present meeting. I had a dream while  on my way home I thought the Ancients in their resurrected bodies  were associating with us in this place. I have the most unbounded confi- dence not ownly in the quorum of the Twelve but also in the first  Presidency. I hope the winter seasons may be profitable to us in our  associations and that we may improve our time   E T Benson said he felt to concur in what had been said I feel it  to be a great blessing to come together we have been blessed according to  the desire of our hearts before I Joined the Saints I felt as though I  would give all I possessed if I could find a people who wold do  right and be led by the spirit and power of God and I could be associated  with them I now feel that I have found that people. I now feel associ- ated with men with whom I could trust my Eternal interes  I could leave my family with them any length of time and find  them all right on my return. I have the utmost confidence  in evry member of that quorum. there is nothing to be done  but what we can do. Evry gift and qualifycation exhists in  this quorum that there is in the church Els we cannot be  equal with the first Presidency and they must have all we have  got or they could not preside over us. If the first Presidency  were to be removed the quorum of the Twelve would have to preside and if they had not the fulness of the gifts they wold not be  fit to preside. I feel excedingly thankful to be associated  with such men I have not language to express my feelings when  I was first called to be an Apostle in this quorum I could not  sleep for three days and nights I feel now as though I could  break a Nation to pieces I felt renovated with the Holy  Spirit while P P Pratt was speaking No blessing is to great or to  good for us and we shall possess them all.   FIGURE Turn over 3 leaves   ENDENTRY A Speech of P. P. Pratt in the Council Chamber of the Legislative Assembly   Council Chamber Wednesday Dec 18th 1852 10 oclok A.M. Councilor P. P. Pratt occupied the Chair in the abscence of the president but resigned it to address the council. The Honorable Counselor said Gentlemen. I resign my place to the Hon CounsellrCouncilor on my left and beg the privilege to express my views on government at some length No merely human Government ever had the power to originate or esstablish a system of true religion but on the other hand a true religious system contains within itself the inherant and inaliena- ble germs of all true Government. True religion has the right and the power to originate government and Laws for individuals Families, Corporate Bodies, States, Nations, Empires, or worlds, A true systems of Religions Embraces all the real government  that intelligent beings can need or reasonably desire in the  Heavens or on the Earth Mearly human government never created a Prophet an Apostle an Eternal High Priest a God or a Son of God. On the other hand the Eternal Priesthood has created worlds and peopled them with man and with all the variety of universal vegitable and animal resources. The Eternal priesthod  has Eternal Priesthood Elected ordained and anointed Kings and priests upon Our Earth and filled them with the spirit of  wisdom knowledge power might majesty and dominion for the benefit, instruction, government, and exhaltation of the race or of the nations or nations thus favored. All governments not growing out of the true system and authority of religion is a perversion a mockery a dark unwieldy mass without  certainty, stability or guarantee for evin peace safety  or perpetoity all such government is either founded in ignorance or self will wharein the people declair either in word or in act that God and Inspiration shall not controll them  and that an Angel Prophet Apostle Priest or King Commishined by him shall have no rule or have no sway in their National Councils. All such governments are either in open violatin  Rebellion against the powers that be or act wholey ignorant of the powers that have a right to be. I will illustrate this subj. by refferane to the past. When man was first placed upon  the Earth did he create governments or was governments  given ^appointed^ to him by the Election of God made manifest by Revelation did the lower Creation rise up and Elect Adam or dig God say Have thou dominion from whence then was the first introduct- ion of merely human government upon our Earth. The answer to this you will find in the words of God which He spake unto Moses on the mount as revealed in those days by our great Prophet and myrter. informing us that Adam begat Sons and  daughters who went out and peopled the land in pairs long before the birth of Cain and Ableel. And when Adam taught them the word of the Lord and the principles of righteousness and true government Satan came also among them and said unto them believe it not and they believed not in the teaching of Adam but they believed Satan more than God or more than the ruler He had appointed Thare then arose the foundation of self Government withot God A government which was perpetual for many centuries and which finally filled the Earth with violence and corruption and was overthrown by the flood of those who survived the flood Noah was of course   ENDENTRY the lawful king Patriarch or ruler and after him the Election of God continued through the loins of Shem down to Abraham but in Abrahams day according to his own writings lately taken from the tombs of ancient Thebees and translated and published by our great Prophet we find a man made goverment existing in Egypt under a race of Phariohs. This Egypt according to Phario Abrahams account was first discovered by Egyptus or Daughter of Ham who afterwards settled her sons in it and from whol whom sprang the race of Pharaioh's and the Ancient Egyptians the same authority also informs us that Ham and his race were cursed as it regards priesthood but blessed in matters pertaining to the  fruits of the Earth and of wisdom. And that the Pharioh's and their priests had not the priesthood although they pretended to have received it from Ham their progenitor. Hence we find a  Government in Egypt of mere human origen and a pri- esthood and Religion by law Esstablished which worshiped several Gods among which was the crockadile and which sacrafized Human sacrafices upon the Alter of State Hence the calling out of Abraham and the reesstablishing of a government of God to be per- petuated in his linage for Ever. which linage is Elected to reign and rule and hold the keys of religion Priesthood Power and Government while the Earth endures and in worlds without End. This govern- ment was perpetuated in the family of Isaac and Jacob and was exem plified in the person of Joseph who by the gift of Revelation became  prime minister of Egypt and saved his Fathers house and the Nations  from Death by famine. Here is an instance of a mere Human  government yielding to be instructed and benefited by a Revelation  and a prophet Behold the result Descending the stream of time and traceing  the fortunes of the chosen or Royal linage we next find a Moses  a man in whom was the spirit of true Religion. By this religion  He overthrew the Egyptians delivered the nation from bondage led  them forth to freedom and gave them laws. By this Religion his  successor Joshua was also Elected and qualified through him  by the laying on of hands and by this religion were all the Judges  chosen and qualifyed to fill the Judiciary with equity and Justice Now Mr President it is Clear that none of these glorious  events were the result of popular Elections or of human  institutions.   God gave a system of Religion Embracing  Inspiration visions Prophets and Priesthood and that Religion  and those prophets and Revelations Created Nations Governments  and Laws. Hence true government in all its Branches and  Ramification is the legitimate result or production  of true Religion. For instant the Prophet Samuel by virtue  of his Religious gift had power to Elect by the word of God  and to Anoint Saul to be king of Israel and by the same  religious authority he had the right to reprove and even to  reject that same king and to anoint and place upon the head  Throne a shepherd boy called david in his stead And  when Samuel was dead and David was king of Israel Nathan  another Prophet had power to reprove him for iniquity and  to pass Judgment upon him for his sins. Again when Elijah  had rebuked King Ahah and all his wicked rulers and adulterous priests  and had fled to the mountains because they rebelled and saught his  life He was commanded to return and Anoint Jehu for King  of Israel. Haziel for King of Syria and Elisha for Prophet in  his Stead which he performed and was taken up.   ENDENTRY In all these things I see not a vestage of the trumpary  of modern human institutions Either of democracy whigery  monarchy or Arisstocricy I see nothing in fact but religion  standing forth in its own native simplicity and clad in the  panoply of its own legiteimate heavenly powers giving government  and Laws to Nations and appointing and Anointing majestrates  kings and Judges to administer the same. But leaving for a moment  the events of palestine I glance for a moment at Babylon  whare sat Nebuchadnezzar in all the pride of self confidence  and self government. This Monarch had denyied the hand of God  and imputed to himself the power and glory of Babylon and the  magnitude and glory of his vast dominion He had also  Esstablished a Religion and created it by law at a given signal  all person ^on pain of death^ were to bow down to his images and idols. But Daniel and his  fellows were their with the true Religion  Dreams, prophesyings, and Miracles  and the word of God Rebuking and punishing him soon converted  him to the truth He then published an Epistle to all Nations  and Tongues under his dominions and in all languages the perpose  of which was that God was a revealer of secrets a worker  of signs and wonders and an originator and controler of political  power and government. ##Daniel 1-4## In Babylon it was soon conseded  that the wisdom of one Revelator or Prophet was ten  times more valuable than all the combined wisdom of its  sages without this gift. Hence Daniel was wisely placed  in power as president of the Presidents of more than a  hundred provinces. ##Daniel 6:1-3## This same Daniel by the word of the  Lord afterwords reproved and Dethroned Belshazer and placed  Cyrus the Mede upon the Throne of Babylon. ##Daniel 5:29-31## This Monarch  obeyed the word of the Lord so far as to restore the Jews and  rebuild their City and Temple. ##Ezra 1## So long as the Jews obeyed  the voice of their Prophets they prospered and were free  but loosing the spirit of prophesy and true religion they  forfeited their institutions laws and doctrin. Hence John the Baptist and Jesus Christ found them in bondage to a  Government Called Rome.   These Romans like the  Greeks before them had manufactured their own Govern ment and Religion and then enforced it upon others insom- uch that the Jews themselves having lost the power of  their own religion were oblieged to submit. John the  Baptist and Jesus Christ reproved all the needless trash  and powerless forms of Jewish sects and of Gentiles supers- titions and restored to the world the gifts of prophesy visions  Miracles. which would have broaken the human  yoke reesstablished the independance of Israel and made  Jerrusalem the perpetual seat of Government for all  nations. But they would not. Jesus Christ would have  made their Temple a house of prayer for all Nations in all  coming time He would have placed there the Eternal keys  of priesthood power and Government and wisdom. ^* A page missed  turn to the star^   The Blackness of Darkness veiled the Earth in morning  Ages—Centuries—now fled— Politics— Laws— Religions have  multiplied- Empires— Kingdoms— States— Republics have  filled the world. But whare— O whare!— The keys powers   ENDENTRY Religion knowledge or Government of God— Our puriton Fathers  fled to the American wilderness to rid themselves from the corr uption of ages. Their children made a Government wise and  Free. But—Alas— The Priesthood—The Power—The Religion  of Heaven had long since been lost to man— Prophets and  Apostles were no more — Our Fathers knew this — And tharefore  as wise honest and consistent men they refrained from man ufacturing a State Religion.   Again were the heavens opened. The Silence of Ages was broaken  The gloom of overhanging night was pierced with a ray from  the worlds of Endless day. A Celestial spark from the heavenly  Altar was rekindled upon the Earth. The mystic veil was rent  in twain. And the fogs and mysts of long Ages began to roll away  as the gloom of a long night before the rising dawn. In the midst  of the ownly great and free nation upon the Earth the God of Abraham  raised up a mighty Prophet gave him the ancient keys  of Religion, Government and power and Restored the Apostleship  with its keys of Revelation vision and Prophecy. Through the  administration of which the laws and government were restored  to man and his Kingdom organized upon the Earth no more  to be thronewn down. People, Magestrates, Senators, Govornors,  and States have opposed its progress with fire and sword and death  but all in vain. It has waded through calumny hate and oppression  and blood and fire and martyrdom Till it organized itself amid  the strong holds of these Eternal Mountains and Stood forth  a Noble spectacle for the wonder and admiration of all Nations  A Government created by Heaven preserved by the matchless  power of the Almighty and led and id instructed by Prophets and  Apostles with the keys of Revelation. The United States  were constrained to recognize and sustain that which no  human power could subdue. Hence the Territorial Govern- ment of Utah. And Hence the local capacity in which  we are now siting as Senators and Representitives to give  Laws to a Territory. In our Local, political capacity  Executive, Legislative and Judicial we are limited to the geogra- phical boundaries prescribed by the act of Congress in this  sens our Jurisdiction is bounded by Oregon On the North  by Calafornia on the West by 37 of North Lat on the South  and by the snow clad sumits of the Backbone of our continent  On the East and thus confined in its immediate bearing to a  country not much larger than the British Isles   But the Eyes of the Nations are upon us, we are a city on  a hill a candle on a candlestick that cannot be hid  The great the noble of heart, the Enterprising, the oppressed  of all Nations will flow to us as a continues stream  Senators Govornors Kings and Rulers will cast their  Eyes to Utah and to her Prophets, Apostles, Revelations  laws and institutions as a model a pattern in miniature  for the renovation of the world. In our capacity as  Prophets Apostles and Elders we have the keys of Authority  to Organize and give laws form and constitution to a thousand  local governments like this. Yes Mr President it is ourse to teach Judges How to rule, To give Senators wisdom and to  repprove instruct and impart wisdom to Presidents and Kings   ENDENTRY It is ours to impart wisdom and knowledge and strength and  salvation to the Rulers and people of the great Nation which gave us birth. Untill they know this and seek it at our hands they will never arise to any considerable degree of permanent prosperity and peace. But On the contrary vexation Disunion perplexity division is their doom and  bloody wars and pestilence and storms and fires and whirlwinds and tempest Earthquakes and famines will continue to waste them till they shall be constrained to acknowledge the hand of God and to humble themselves as in the dust and seek wisdom and instruction at the hand of prophets and Apostles as did Kings and rulers in days of Old. Untill like Nebuchadnezzar they shall acknowledge that God is a Revelator a worker of signs and wonders and an originator and controllor of political Governments. Yes Mr President Our Nation and the world shall be b taught by the prophets and all Nations feel the influence  of the Institutions now being developted in thes Halls of liberty the chambers of the Eternal Mountains of Deserett Let the United States go on in their course own strength without the inspiration and institutions of the Almighty now offered them by our Prophets let them spread abroad their dominions on evry side. Let the principles of conquest  or of annexation add the Canadies British Amarica and  even Greenland on the North, Spanish and Portugue Amarican to cape horn on the South. The west Indies on the East and the Isles of the Pacific including Japan on the west Let these countries be gathered under the wings of the wide spread Eagle and let them be peopled by the Enterprising of all Nations by Hundreds of Millions. Let their rich and almost boundless resources be developed by all these and still remain Ignorant and  destitute of the keys of knowledge and power which lead and  govern the destinies of Deseret or of Utah yet shall  the Institutions of that same Utah or of her people outweigh all this have more present influence in the Destinies of the world and abide and give Laws and Religion to Man when the best of mere human, civil, Political, Moral, social and  Religious Institutions has sceased to be and its memory ownly shadowed forth in the dim History of the past.   * as was^is^ predicted by the Ancient Prophets Though  Heaven and Earth should be moved from their foundations Though the bright lumainary of Day should refuse its light. The moon cease to fullfill its monthly ordinance and yonder Stars be hurled from their places spheres yet the Government the Nationality the priesthood  the Oracles, the Religion, the Throne of Israel should never be removed, a man be wanting to fill that Throne  or a priest to minister at the alter of her Holy Temple. All nations would have to come to worship before the Lord and from this center they would have drawn their light and power. Their Kings chosen and anointed and  instructed by her Prophets and Apostles would have esstablished peace and Equity and Justice and truth in the Earth. In short there page torn   ENDENTRY would have been One Lord and his name one in all the Earth but the Jews rebelled against their King and prefered their own powerless forms of religion. Jesus and his Apostles on this account removed from their midst the Keys of Gove rnment and power and left them a prey to civil war pestilance and famine and to the raviges of the Romans After the over throw of the Jews the Romans were suffered to imbrue their hands in the blood of Apostles Prophets and Saints till none to remain who possedssed the keys of religion and government. It was then the powers of darkness triump- hed upon our Earth. Self constituted Government and human religions overran our Earth. Truth was banished  and fled far away. Equity could not Enter. Justice was  paralized and stood Aghast. Mercy retireing droped a tear of blood.)   FIGURE E T Benson continued  from 6 pages back  Ask whatsoever you will and it shall  be ours my love for the quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the First Presidency is far above the love of women {You may take the most virtuous woman on earth into your bosom and there is something illegible in it.} There is not exhisting with the most virtuous man on Earth (while destitute of the priesthood and Holy Ghost) that spirit of life that there is with the servant of God. My ownly hope is with you it is life when we met  and life when we part He closed with Thanksgiving and blessings   Amasa did know not whare to begin He felt that his sentiments and feelings were shadowed forth in his labours. I have great Joy in meeting with you and beholding your faces and contemplating the influence and power of this quorum and the greatness of their work I anticipate much  this winter in our meetings and in enjoying the blessings of God. I have rejoiced this night to hear the exhalted expressions of the quorum  in rendering thanksgiving to God and not one word of complaint or hardships imprisionments or affliction of any king but are filled with hidden Joy and pleasure. I feel determin to do all the work that is assigned me that I may be worthy of a place in this quorum I felt thankful to hear the blessings pronounced upon us bo by our president He closed with Joy and Thanksgiving   W. Woodruff addressed the quorum upon the importance of ther writing. the importance of their keeping a private History of ther lives labour and ministry, and also a Joint History of the Quorum  of the Twelve Apostles He said he had ever been inspired since He had ben a member of the Church not ownly to write  all of his own acts and life, but to write all the sermons teachings and prophesies of the prophet Brigham Young and counsel and of the Twelve Apostles as far as he was acquainted with their labour He said each member of the quorum should keep an account of their missions, works miracles and the bless- ings of God unto them. And that the history of the quorum of the Twelve could now be easily obtained but if we omitted it untill we were dead our friends could not get it correctly before the world   P. P. Pratt spoke of the filling up of the quorum of the 12 in 1848 and of their commencement of a record of the quorum and wishes it    ENDENTRY continued. He said he did not know how far and minute we ought to be in writing a Journal but thinks we ought to record our  official acts and considers it for our interest as well as duty thus to do   Richards wished him  to requst the young members of this quorum to hand to him  a short statement of their lives and ministry the time they recvd the gospel andc to go into the Church History   P P Pratt interchanged a few words upon the subject of Journal keeping andc   F. D. Richards next spoke and said he felt highly to participate in the common Joy of the evening and felt it was an omin of the times, an eventful epok in the last dispensation to us and the world. I feel behind most of the quorum in not having the privilege of so much counsel and teaching from Brother Joseph as they. when I contemplate the future I feel that the field of our labour was equal to the Noblest amibition which man could entertain both in this world and in the next felt his Joy tempered in the recollection   O. Hyde said while I have been listening I have had an unusual train of reflection of necessity we shall soon be called again to separate and the Kingdoms of this world must become the Kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ. we are trained in the school of experience I may live to see you all in different parts of the Earth and while the Kingdoms  of the Earth are falling you will in many instances be enabled to stretc out your hands and give counsel and save many people and be enabled to  rule governments and thus fulfilll the prophesies, and many of thes things are not afar off. All is Eternity to us whether this or  the other side of the veil. we are born in Eternity, and let us be whare we will, it will be our calling to win souls to Christ The Presidency are unwell or they would be here. I wish the Journals of the Twelve to be written up so they can be on hand when Needed to be published I wish each one of the quorum wold write as good an Epistle as they are capable of and have then put in book form and send them forth unto the world   P P. Pratt Thingks the subject is abounding in us and we owe the world a testimony not as individuals but as a quorum  of the Twelve Apostles and suggest that each contributes and write an Epistle and form the whole and compile and embody a Book to go forth with the signatures of all the quorum as the combined History of all the ^12^ Apostles   G. A. Smith thinks it vary important that an Authentic  History of each member should be preserved   W. Woodruff made mention of certain items which he considered necessary in the preservation of our History He lamented that David W. Patten had not left any record of his life for he  was a prophet and an Apostle and a mighty man. many miracles were wrought by him in his ministry. He told a rich man  in Tennessee who fought the work of God that he and his family should beg their bread Robert. C. Petty saw that same man cry at a blacksmith shop because he could not get trusted   ENDENTRY to have his plough sharpened   President Orson Hoyde moved that Wilford Woodruff  be the clerk and historian of the Twelve Apostles carried unan- imously   P P Pratt proposed a new Record and wished that the Nar ative of each of the quorum of the Twelve be first recorded  in it begining with the president of the quorum and going through  in rotation with each member as he stands in the quorum   W Woodruff says he is willing to serve the quorum as Historian  as faithfully as he can. although it will be a heavy tax upon  his time   E Snow enquires if this history contemplated is confined to the  present quorum or of the members from the begining P. P. Prat  thinks it should include the present quorum merely E Snow  would like to see included all that could be found of D W.  Patten. C. C. Rich said he heard Brother Patten say the  morning that he was martered that the Kingdom of God shall  be delivered or he should lay down his life. P P Pratt wished  Brother Woodruff to leave all temporal business as much as  possible and bring this history up. A Lyman says their is no  date of his ordination.

O how time  flies and how great, how important how magnificent, and how  mighty are the Events born on its wings it is the opening of a dispen sation that swallows up all other dispensations since the world  began the deeds of the last thousand years sink into insigniff- icans in comparrison to the work of a year at the present time  The Heavens gaze upon the scenes as they pass with deep interes  while the whole Earth beholds the scenes in wonder and amacement The ancients Prophets saw by vision and revelation the scenes which  were to follow each other in quick succession in this age in the  esstablishment of the great Kingdom of our God to be thrown  down no more forever. The little stone cut out of the mountain  without hands that was to roll forth untill it became a mountain  and filled the whole Earth and broke in peaces and subdued all other  kingdoms and was to stand forever as seen by the prophet Daniel  has commenced its work. that Church and Kingdom of God is  now on the Earth and is being esstablished which must endure and the  world are gaziong upon it, it is now located in these vallies of the  mountains like a city set upon a hill which cannot be hid. its  first Prophet and Founder has laid down his life in its defence  He has been martered, and his blood is crying from the ground  for vangance upon a great Nation. many others have fallen  a martyr to the truth and the gospel of Jesus Christ since the organiza- tion of this church in A.D. 1830 and many others may, yet the  Church is bound to arise and prosper untill the Zion and Kingdom  of our God shall stand forth in bold relief containing all that  power, strength, might, majesty and dominion which God has  decreed concerning her and been spoken through the mouths of  his Holy Prophets since the world began. This Church and Kingdom  has continued steadily to arise since its first organization amid  oppostion, oppression, persecution, and martyrdom untill it has become  esstablished in the midst of thes everlasting hills and mountains not ownly  gaining strength in church but also in state. Ephraims Nobles are  of himself and his Govonor has procedid out of the midst of him.

Their is a  power who has decreed that liberty freedom and the rights of the  Righteous and the meeke of the Earth shall not wholey die and that power  is God. And He has decreed to inspire and nerve up the Soul the  sinew and the Arm of his Govornors Senators and prophets and  Arm them for the contest, and defend them in their warfare  That Nation or Kingdom or Toungue or people, from this time forth  who shall rise up against Zion and the Church and Kingdom of God  to oppress her.

The senti- ment was instanteneous in the hearts of all the quorum and spoken by president  Orson Hyde, treat us with your blessings then President Young blessed the  quorum of the Twelve and said they always had his blessings. And the Twelve  Apostles felt and realized that the blessings of the Presidency of the Church and Kingdom of God was of far more worth and benefit to them than any  Earthly gift or the Treasures of the Earth their hearts were full of joy  and gladness which was unspeakable at the blessing of once more having  the privilege of returning from the four corners of the Earth and beholding each  others faces and sitting in council together and meeting with the president  and his counsel and receiving blessings at their hands. The Twelve left their blessgs  upon President Young and his house while the Twelve were paying their respts  to President Young the band was playing a lively tune in front of the House  the quorum saluted the two bands with a Happy New Year and received in  return some excellent music. The quorum then visited President Heber C Kimball and wished him a happy new Year. He also received  the Twelve with Gladness and gave unto them his blessings which was also highly prized. In his blessings unto them he said his faith and feelings were  that no one of the present quorum of Apostles should ever fall and no power  should ever take their Crown and Kingdom but they should come forth in the morning of the first Resurrection and be exhalted to glory immortal- ity and Eternal lives, and their blessings should increase from this time  henceforth and for ever and they should not want bread but they should  have means to support themselves and families. My Feelings have ever  been good towards this quorum and ever will be. The Twelve left their blessings upon presidet Kimball and household. And next visited Father  John Smith the aged Patriarch and wished him a happy New Year. He  manifested much Joy and satisfaction in seeing Eleven of the Twelve  Apostles beneath his roof. This venerable Patriarch also bestowed upon  the Twelve his blessing, and said they should live to see the Kingdom of God ^and Zion^ ess tablished to be thrown down no more forever and that none of them should  ever fall but should have part in the first resurrection, no power should take their crown but they should be blessed in all their labours in  the Earth and that the blessings of God should increase upon them from  this time forth both temporal and spiritual. The Apostles also left their blessings upon the Patriarch and his household they next visited President  Willard Richards He also received them with Gladness and an open hart they wished him a Happy new year. He also gave the Twelve his blessing He believed this is a begining of an Eventful year in the History  of this Church and kingdom on the Earth and he believed each suceeding   year would be more and more so untill the coming of the son of man He said the Twelve were ever before him in his thoughts prayers and  blessings notwithstanding they might be scattered to the fore cornors of the Earth they were men of God and were destined to perform a great and mighty work in  the Earth and they should live till they were satisfyed with life they should see light and truth prevail over sin tradition and Error and triumph in the Earth. The Twelve next went to the house of Elder P. P Pratt and there united with his family in singing the return  of the Twelve and other songs of Zion. The spirit and power of God rested upon the quorum of the  Twelve while their hearts were filled with praise and thanksgiving to God in all their visits  on this the new year of 1853. The bands also continued their salutations to Presidents Kimball  Richards and Patriarch Smith and many others in various parts of the City and their enlivening music was evry whare received with open ears and harts of Joy God bless the bands   ENDENTRY during the evening the quorum of the Twelve with the Presidency with about 200 Latter Day Saints met with their familis at the Social Hall and dedicated  it for the purpose for which it was built, after which they went forth  in the dance and all seemed to enjoy themselves well    ENDENTRY January 2, 1853 ~ Sunday   Jan 2nd Sunday I attended meeting Brother Joseph Toronto Preached  and gave an account of his Travells out through Italy and the dangers he run in  in Preaching the gospel to his native country He was among the waldens He spoke of the hard labour they had to Endure in order to get a living  that they not ownly backed up their hay and wood upon their back  but also the Earth to make gardins to raise their vegitables. his rehers  account of his ministry was quite interesting.

P. Pratt preached. his subject was the  Kingdom of God which was to be set up in the last days He  said if we were to take the present order rules and regulations  of either the Jews, Gentiles Christian or pagan as as Standrd standard to set up as the patern for the great Kingdom of our  God of which the prophets had spoken their was none of the  which would fit compare or answer the purpose at all for the  last dispensation when did we ever see a generation or any  Nation make their own prophets and Apostles to get Revelation  and do the wok of God. In order to set up a kingdom and government  in the last days to gather the 10 Tribes of Israel the Jews and gentiles  and all Nations break down the Romon power build up  esstablish Zion and maintain it. it must be sumthing different  from any Human government or device of man it must  originate from the heavens be governed and controlled by the  God of heaven led by inspiration and Revelation in all of its  undertakings and it must contain within itself all the blessings  and covenants which God made to Abraham concerning his  seed and posterity. This Kingdom is here in the valley of the  mountains it has been esstablished by the hand of God and  it embraces all that God has promised, or that is necessary to perfect the great work or all that Jew or Gentile can look for it embraces the whole of the New and everlasting covenant the fulness  of the gospel, with all the power and Authority of the same the  Keys of the Kingdom the endowments sealing powers the patriarchal  Matrimony and the foundation laid for gathering all Israel.   The Ancient deciples and Apostles did not set up this  Kingdom as some have supposed when they inquired of  Jesus if he would at that time restore again the Kingdom to  Israel Jesus informed them that it was not given to  them to know (even) the times and seasons which the Lord  had reserved unto himself when he would set up the  Kingdom so they were not permitted to know the time  much less to perform the work They asked the Saviour  what they should do then He told them they should bear  witness of his name before both Jew and gentile and for  this same testimony they would have to lay down their lives the Kingdom of God was set up in their day but the people  would not permit it to remain long among them for they killed  the prophets, Apostles, and Elders who preached the gospel of the  kingdom of the Kingdom of God and the priesthood and Kingdom  of God was taken from them and they have fallen into darkness and  Error. But now the Kingdom of God is set up for the last time  to again restore Israel and you cannot force Israel even  by the sword to receive a Kingdom and Laws and acknowledge the  great standard which is to be set up in the last days for the  governing gathering and controlling of all Israel except it  is right and according to the promises made to the Fathers and this  Kingdom of God when it was to appear was to be like a mustard  seed it was to be the least of all herbs but was to grow untill the  folls fowls of heaven lodged in the branches thereoff. should we  attempt to take any of the Kingdoms of the world as this great  standard out of which to build the Kingdom of God it would not  compare at all with the parable given. but when we take   ENDENTRY the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints it does compare  in every respect and contains within itself evry thing that is promis  in the great standard that was to be set up in the last days it is no  matter what this is called at the present time a church a republic  or a Kingdom. the Kingdom is certainly here and in vary deed  it has commenced like a mustard seed vary small but as the seed  gathers its seed mosture from the Earth which causes it to spring forth  and take root so will this Kingdom continue to gather the good from  all Nations untill it becomes the greatest of All Kingdoms under  Heaven and untill the Kingdoms of this world become the Kingdom  of our God and his Christ the signs of this Kingdom are appearing in  the heavens and the Earth that was spoken off by Christ and the Apotles  and why should not the Kingdom appear some may say I have been  Baptized Joined the church am in the Kingdom Now why may not  I go to Calafornia and get gold and take all the comfort I can in this  world well if one part of the Kingdom of God have a right to  go the whole have and scatter abroad then whare is your Kingdom  and gathering we are now in as good a place as we can get in if we were to go to calafornia we would be whare we would  be in the midst of the scum of Hell. If we should go to Cal  or New Orlens because we could get sugar for 3 cts whare would  the work of the Kingdom of God be my views are that when  we are gathered we keep so and build up Temples give Endowments to  the living and dead except as we go on missions abroad in the  world as the Angels would go to hell on a mission and be glad to  return as soon as they got through. If you want gold build  up the Kingdom of God make Zion a city on a hill that cannot  be hid and carry out the purposes of the Lord and then gold will  flow in unto you from all Nations your Presidency and Apostles  will then hardly have time to go out of the Temple to get their  breakfast instead of runing about to know how to get their land  ploughed so as to raise bread to eat and while all Nations are brea king up. the rich among them will invest their wealth among the  institution of Zion and not trust it among the sinking Nations  and those that wished to save their lives will flee to Zion for safety  for they will be the ownly people that will not be at war one  with another many other Edifying remrks were mad by the speakr   Elder Amasa Lyman followed and said that the members of  this Kingdom possessed that faith and knowledge that if all the  world would say they did not believe it it would not make  any difference with them for they know of its truths The  sectarian world can write and say many putty things but  why do they not carry them into practice the main difficulty  is their is no nucleus around which to gather, in order to  practice what they preach. but we believe that when God said  he would set up a kingdom which should break in peaces  all other Kingdoms and stand forever that He will perform what  He has spoken. The Lord has said that that Nation that  fought against Zion should be broaken in peaces and utterly  wasted away and while the Elders are gathering the Saints from  all Nations and Kingdoms and will continue untill the winding up  scene we can make some calculation what Zion is destined  to be. many other remarks were made by Brother Lyman   ENDENTRY I attended prayer meeting with the Presidency and Twelve in the Af- ternoon and I preached in the evening to a full House in the 14th  ward school House I also spoke upon the kingdom of God said that none of the words of the Lord spoken would retu- rn unto him void but would accomplish all that he had  declaired that the Elders were gaining more strength and  confidence and power, in declairing the Kingdom of God to  the world.

I wish to exhort the people here to an item of our religion yet I am happy to say that the item that  I am about to exhort you to the people generally are ready to carry out firstly I would say let us observe the mormon creed let evry mind their own business evry one has weeds enough in  his own guarding to attend to without attending to the weeds  in his Neighbors garden for while you are attending to the weeds of your Neighbor those in your own will grow vary thick and tall and will finally spoil the good seed I am asstonished  that the people do not see that they can get along much better without doing evil than with. if a person does you an injury dont retaliate and you get a great advantage of the person doing the evil if a person injures you do him good and you get the advantage of him and the victory. Follow the counsel of Brother Snow and  improve your time in study and treasureing up knowledge childn should have their times of recreations for if they are kept still from seeing and knowing any thing appertaining to amusements till they are 18 yars of age when they do get out they will act  vary wild. but let the children sow their wild oats do up the dancing and frolicking while young that when they get older they may read the Bible Book of Mormon and preach the gospel and do goog good on the Earth I want to know all their is on Earth in Heaven and Hell so that no person shall know more than I do but  in obtaining this knowledge I do not wish to sin their is  no need of singing.   If the weather had been good I should have called upon the people to have commenced diging out the foundation of the Temple I want to lay the cornor stone of the Temple on the 6th day of next  April if the Lord will if you want to know what size I am calculating to build the Temple I will say I am expecting to break ground 150 feet by 220 And the foundation for the building to stand upon 20 feet deep and 20 feet wide and 10 feet high the basement story will then commence on  the top of the foundation and that will be 16 feet high 8 feet under ground and 8 feet above then the main building will commence on the top of the basement story. what is there here in this valley that should hendor this people from being happy I am  happy because I do not fret about any thing that I cannot  do.
