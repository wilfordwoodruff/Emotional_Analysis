The follow is a synopsis of the discours FIGURES L.D.B W.B.    before us this morning is one that fills my mind with many reflections I think the Elders of this Church &amp; kingdom  do not improve their time as they should but are to slow in treasure up knowledge as God has commanded us to do we shall want all the knowledge we can obtain when we go to the nations of the Earth &amp; visit evry circle of the  learned to teach them the plan of salvation if we have improved our time we can bring forth out of the treasures of our  hearts things new and old. The subject before me  to day is the remains of Lorenzo D. Barnes &amp; W the question might arise what benefit could it be to those  Brethren to be brought from their Graves in a foreign  country &amp; be buried with the saints here. I do not think it would be a great advantage to them in the Eternal world I had as lieves to be buried in Asia or Africa as with the  the Saints here as far as my Eternal interest is conserned but aside from this it is a great pleasure both to the living &amp;  the dead to know that our bodies will be brought to Zion  from the Ends of the Earth to be laid with the saints  &amp; then to be raised with them so that he can strike  hands with his relatives first &amp; then with the saints instead of being thousands of miles apart &amp; having to waft himself thousands of miles through the air to meet with his brethren. An Immortal being can take  himself up into the heavens as Jesus Christ did when he was raised from the dead He went to heaven So it might be with them. How long would it take for Brother Barnes &amp; Burton to waft themselves to the bosom of the Church Not long whare will be the bosom of the Church in the clouds above the Earth before the wicked are d the Lord will be in the Air &amp; all the saints with him of all generations and He will desend to earth &amp; will bring all the  Saints with him. At what speed would the Saints travel  we are told that light is the power that governs all things if the saints travel as fast as light they would go at the  rate of 200000 miles in a second. God can go as fast as light and He has made the saints and I am led to conclude that  they can travel as fast as light for they have got to go on  missions to far distant worlds and if they did not go  as fast as light they would be a long time on their way spending  their time without doing any good if this is the case I had  as lieves lay my body down abroad as at home as it would not take more than a second to meet with the Saints I say  this to encourage the Elders who are going abroad some may  die abroad some may Seal their testimony with their  Blood. The Elders should take Heed &amp; not break the comma- ndments of God if they were to commit adultery after   ENDENTRY  must be destroyed in the flesh &amp; his spirit given to the  buffiting of Satan untill the first Resurrection How long it will be from the morning till evening I  am not able to say but after the day of redemption  He will come forth and inherit all the blessings that  were sealed upon his head no power can take them  from him If he has been sealed to any woman thrones powers Dominions or Kingdoms or any  other blessing He will inherit them to all Eternity  if they do not shed innocent Blood. The scriptures speak of these same subjects. Paul while speaking  to the Corinthian Churches speaks of delivering a certain  one to the buffiting of Satan that they may be destroyed  in the flesh that their spirits may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. we will now speak of David  who had a numerous family that was given him He finally took Uriah wife put Uriah at the Head  of the Battle &amp; He was slain. Here He lost all right to the  celestial Glory His   He will be a servant to somebody perhaps Uriah for  the Gods in Eternity will want servants to greece their  carriages makes crowns &amp; Robes &amp;c they will be Gods  &amp; want servants. All may be capaciated to become  Gods but all will not keep the Laws whareby they  may become Gods. Peter spoke of a people who had  shed inocent Bloo &amp; drew the Blood of the Savior they  were told to repent that they might be saved in the  day of the Lord Jesus Christ. There was a chance for them as they did not know the Priesthood or the fulness  of the gospel if they had know it they would not have  been forgiven. We will now speak of Brother Lorenzo D. Barnes He was faithful but died before he received the fulness of the gospel He had no Thrones, wives or any thing els of that kind sealed upon him what shall we  do for him any thing that we do for ourselves when we get a temple built such men will loose nothing for they will be Judged by the same laws  that we are and they have a chane either in time or Eternity to receive all we have. for all that  would have received it here will receive it there for all  men will be Judged like men in the flesh for all mankind  will have an Equal privilege there cannot be any baptism Endowments or Ordinances in the spirit world performed  but we shall be called to perform in a Temple of the  Lord all the ordinances for the dead the same as for the  living all things will be sealed to the End of all things preparitory to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ whether  they be appertaining to Thrones, kingdoms, families or anything  Els pertaining to Earth or Heaven time or Eternity. when  we fully consider our duty we shall not be at Ease in  Zion or spend our time to make farms &amp; Houses orchards &amp;  vineyards for ourselves alone. But we should go to work to build  up Zion &amp; a Temple &amp; do the great work of our God wo to them that are at ease in Zion but wake up &amp; do the work of our God   ENDENTRY September 13, 1852       ENDENTRY September 14, 1852    $153.35 cts to be forwarded to Carter    ENDENTRY September 15, 1852 ~ Wednesday to  ENDENTRY September 18, 1852    the Irricipilis    ENDENTRY September 19, 1852       ENDENTRY September 20, 1852 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY September 25, 1852    Bulah  was quite sick during the week Also Mrs Webster was taken vary sick    ENDENTRY September 26, 1852    growing worse the rest of the family are geting better I am not able to attend meeting    ENDENTRY September 27, 1852    dangerously sick the rest of the family are feeble    ENDENTRY September 28, 1852    some papers from J.

The Meeting opened by  prayer by President Orson Hyde who is president of the  Twelve Apostles. The names of the Twelve who were present  were O Hyde A Lyman  F D Richards    the rare &amp; eventful occasion upon which we are now met  He offered up a fervent prayer &amp; Thanksgiving to God for  his blessings that had been over us in our separation &amp; in bring- ing us together &amp; asked for all needful blessings to qualify us  for our futur labours untill we arive in the celestial kingdom  of God He then said he did not feel like making a long speech  but merely interchanging our harty congratulations in ackno- wledgeing the mercy &amp; blessings of God    to our vast separetion &amp; merciful reunion said this is the first  opportunity we have had of being together as a quorum  &amp; feeling that each member has the most implicit  confidence in evry member of the quorum of the Twelve  &amp; also in each member of the Presidency who presides over  us. I feel as though the day is not far distant when men  will stand among us in their Immortal Bodies holding the keys  of death &amp; Hell &amp; that Brother Joseph would say if he was among  us that we had suffered enough &amp; that we should be numbered  among his Jewels He alluded to the great work we had to per- form, the building of a Temple &amp;c    ect of this meeting of the Twelve Apostles a blessing which he  never before enjoyed in his life. As he never had met   ENDENTRY  never been but two bodies of men since the days of Adam  who had met under such peculier &amp; interesting circumstances  &amp; those were the Twelve Apostle with Jesus in Jerrusalem &amp; the  Twelve Apostle with Jesus in America we know their History &amp; works  &amp; we know our own &amp; they are three events of great importance  to the salvation of the world. He refered to the peculiar &amp; strik- ing fact that there had never been a death in the quorum of the  Twelve Apostles except in the case of David. W. Patten who fel a martyr to his religion by a special request which he made of  the Lord that he might die that death. But the rest of the quorum of the Twelve have stood in the front of the battle &amp; the danger  for the last twenty years in the midst of mobs sickness &amp; plagues  &amp; dangers by sea &amp; land but still they were preserved untill the  present day in bloom &amp; health He refered to the great prosperity &amp;  work of the Twelve abroad among the nations &amp; rejoiced that the  Lord had preserved them to return Earth to again sit in counsel together in Zion. He had the most im- plicit confidence in each member of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles  also of the Presidency who presided over us said President Young was a Father  to the whole church    quorum of the Twelve yet he had known the quorum from the begining  when they were first together in his fathers house He expressed his  Joy in being with the quorum &amp; his Entire confidence in each member  of the quorum &amp; in the Saints generally. Since his absence to Denmark  he had felt &amp; learned how to appreciate the society at home &amp; the brethren  &amp; anticipated much pleasure in the association of this present winter hoped our meetings might be freequent &amp; that we might become  much improved.    it is while we are together as we are moved upon by the Holy Ghost  and if we dont fell to prophesy speak by faith &amp; by faith it  should be fulfilled expressed his unlimited confidence in evry member  of the Quorum &amp; of the Presidency and Prophesied in the name  of God that we should all meet &amp; come forth in the morning  of the first Resurrection &amp; receive our crowns in the celestial  kingdom it was confirmed by a good Amen by all the quorum    He refered to the changes taking place among the Nation of the Earth &amp; he  believed we were destined to soon hold a great influence among them  He had felt moved upon at times to offer  to sir Robert Peel &amp; Louis Napolian &amp; such men &amp; tell them that  he could give them advice that would do them good He believed the  day near when the kings  in the begining the Elders went out &amp; were weak &amp; ignorant men now  they are full of intelligence &amp; the Nations of the Earth will feel their  influence when I am with this quorum I feel as though I was  with the Gods.    rejoiced to see the union of the quorum &amp; their disposition to do right  we dont have to feel that one of the quorum like Lyman Wight is  drawing off one way &amp; W ing iniquity &amp; we have to sustain him against our feelings. I have   ENDENTRY  is doing right &amp; I rejoice that the quorum is able to publish the  gospel in six different Languages &amp; to gather the people  together Hoped we should meet once a week &amp; with the Presidency  offer our prayers. He felt a proud satisfaction of being associ- ated with 10 men which he believed to be the highest learned  best Educated &amp; possessed the most intelligence of any man on  Earth That our circumstances were such that we were oblieged  to have the most knowledge whether we would or not. He believed  the prophesies uttered this evening would be fulfilled to the utter most  He closed with his blessings upon us.    not what point to speak from He felt in his nature that he was  made up in the work of the Lord &amp; he could not embrace any interest  any whare els ownly in this work. He has found out to his satisfa- ction what that love &amp; affection for his brethren is that surpases the  love of women for he had a confidence in his quorum that was  far greater than in his wives or children for they have been  brought up in the hard school of experience &amp; have been tried in  all things &amp; proven to be true &amp; I have been proven with them  &amp; I am wedded to my quorum with all my interest I go when  I am sent &amp; come when I am called, &amp; so expect to continue to do  my interest is inseparably conneted with this kingdom &amp; I trust  ever will be through time &amp; Eternity.    in them all I am happy in the present meeting. I had a dream while  on my way home I thought the Ancients in their resurrected bodies  were associating with us in this place. I have the most unbounded confi- dence not ownly in the quorum of the Twelve but also in the first  Presidency. I hope the winter seasons may be profitable to us in our  associations and that we may improve our time    to be a great blessing to come together we have been blessed according to  the desire of our hearts before I Joined the Saints I felt as though I  would give all I possessed if I could find a people who wold do  right &amp; be led by the spirit &amp; power of God &amp; I could be associated  with them I now feel that I have found that people. I now feel associ- ated with men with whom I could trust my Eternal interes  I could leave my family with them any length of time &amp; find  them all right on my return. I have the utmost confidence  in evry member of that quorum. there is nothing to be done  but what we can do. Evry gift &amp; qualifycation exhists in  this quorum that there is in the church Els we cannot be  equal with the first Presidency &amp; they must have all we have  got or they could not preside over us. If the first Presidency  were to be removed the quorum of the Twelve would have to preside &amp; if they had not the fulness of the gifts they wold not be  fit to preside. I feel excedingly thankful to be associated  with such men I have not language to express my feelings when  I was first called to be an Apostle in this quorum I could not  sleep for three days &amp; nights I feel now as though I could  break a Nation to pieces I felt renovated with the Holy  Spirit while P P Pratt was speaking No blessing is to great or to  good for us &amp; we shall possess them all.      ENDENTRY     Councilor P. P. Pratt occupied the Chair in the abscence of the president but resigned it to address the council. The Honorable Counselor said Gentlemen. I resign my place to the Hon  &amp; beg the privilege to express my views on government at some length No merely human Government ever had the power to originate or esstablish a system of true religion but on the other hand a true religious system contains within itself the inherant and inaliena- ble germs of all true Government. True religion has the right &amp; the power to originate government &amp; Laws for individuals Families, Corporate Bodies, States, Nations, Empires, or worlds, A true systems of Religions Embraces all the real government  that intelligent beings can need or reasonably desire in the  Heavens or on the Earth Mearly human government never created a Prophet an Apostle an Eternal High Priest a God or a Son of God. On the other hand the Eternal Priesthood has created worlds &amp; peopled them with man &amp; with all the variety of universal vegitable &amp; animal resources. The Eternal priesthod  has  &amp; priests upon Our Earth &amp; filled them with the spirit of  wisdom knowledge power might majesty &amp; dominion for the benefit, instruction, government, &amp; exhaltation of the race or of the nations or nations thus favored. All governments not growing out of the true system &amp; authority of religion is a perversion a mockery a dark unwieldy mass without  certainty, stability or guarantee for evin peace safety  or perpetoity all such government is either founded in ignorance or self will wharein the people declair either in word or in act that God and Inspiration shall not controll them  &amp; that an Angel Prophet Apostle Priest or King Commishined by him shall have no rule or have no sway in their National Councils. All such governments are either in open  Rebe of the powers that have a right to be. I will illustrate this subj. by refferane to the past. When man was first placed upon  the Earth did he create governments or was governments   did the lower Creation rise up &amp; Elect Adam or dig God say  ion of merely human government upon our Earth. The answer to this  unto Moses on the mount as revealed in those days by our great Prophet &amp; myrter. informing us that Adam begat Sons &amp;  daughters who went out &amp; peopled the land in pairs long before the birth of Cain &amp; Ab of the Lord &amp; the principles of righteousness &amp; true government Satan came also among them &amp; said unto them believe it not and they believed not in the teaching of Adam but they believed Satan more than God or more than the ruler He had appointed Thare then arose the foundation of self Government withot God A government which was perpetual for many centuries and which finally filled the Earth with violence &amp; corruption &amp; was overthrown by the flood of those who survived the flood Noah was of course   ENDENTRY  of God continued through the loins of Shem down to Abraham but in Abrahams day according to his own writings lately taken from the tombs of ancient Thebees &amp; translated and published by our great Prophet we find a man made goverment existing in Egypt under a race of Phariohs. This Egypt according to  Daughter of Ham who afterwards settled her sons in it &amp; from  whom sprang the race of Phar authority also informs us that Ham &amp; his race were cursed as it regards priesthood but blessed in matters pertaining to the  fruits of the Earth &amp; of wisdom. And that the Pharioh's &amp; their priests had not the priesthood although they pretended to have received it from Ham their progenitor. Hence we find a  Government in Egypt of mere human origen and a pri- esthood and Religion by law Esstablished which worshiped several Gods among which was the crockadile &amp; which sacrafized Human sacrafices upon the Alter of State Hence the calling out of Abra petuated in his linage for Ever. which linage is Elected to reign &amp; rule &amp; hold the keys of religion Priesthood Power &amp; Government while the Earth endures &amp; in worlds without End. This govern- ment was perpetuated in the family of Isaac &amp; Jacob &amp; was exem plified in the person of Joseph who by the gift of Revelation became  prime minister of Egypt &amp; saved his Fathers house &amp; the Nations  from Death by famine. Here is an instance of a mere Human  government yielding to be instructed &amp; benefited by a Revelation  &amp; a prophet Behold the result Descending the stream of time &amp; traceing  the fortunes of the chosen or Royal linage we next find a Moses  a man in whom was the spirit of true Religion. By this religion  He overthrew the Egyptians delivered the nation from bondage led  them forth to freedom &amp; gave them laws. By this Religion his  successor Joshua was also Elected &amp; qualified through him  by the laying on of hands and by this religion were all the Judges  chosen &amp; qualifyed to fill the Judiciary with equity &amp; Justice Now Mr President it is Clear that none of these glorious  events were the result of popular Elections or of human  institutions.    Inspiration visions Prophets &amp; Priesthood &amp; that Religion  &amp; those prophets &amp; Revelations Created Nations Governments  &amp; Laws. Hence true government in all its Branches and  Ramification is the legitimate result or production  of true Religion. For instant the Prophet Samuel by virtue  of his Religious gift had power to Elect by the word of God  &amp; to Anoint Saul to be king of Israel and by the same  religious authority he had the right to reprove &amp; even to  reject that same king &amp; to anoint &amp; place upon the  Throne a shepherd boy called david in his stead And  when Samuel was dead &amp; David was king of Israel Nathan  another Prophet had power to reprove him for iniquity &amp;  to pass Judgment upon him for his sins. Again when Elijah  had rebuked King Ahah &amp; all his wicked rulers &amp; adulterous priests  &amp; had fled to the mountains because they rebelled &amp; saught his  life He was commanded to return and Anoint Jehu for King  of Israel. Haziel for King of Syria &amp; Elisha for Prophet in  his Stead which he performed &amp; was taken up.   ENDENTRY  of modern human institutions Either of democracy whigery  monarchy or Arisstocricy I see nothing in fact but religion  standing forth in its own native simplicity &amp; clad in the  panoply of its own legit &amp; Laws to Nations and appointing and Anointing majestrates  kings &amp; Judges to administer the same. But leaving for a moment  the events of palestine I glance for a moment at Babylon  whare sat Nebuchadnezzar in all the pride of self confidence  &amp; self government. This Monarch had den &amp; imputed to himself the power &amp; glory of Babylon and the  magnitude &amp; glory of his vast dominion He had also  Esstablished a Religion &amp; created it by law at a given signal  all person ^on pain of death^ were to bow down to his images &amp; idols. But Daniel &amp; his  fellows were their with the true Religion  Dreams, prophesyings, and Miracles  &amp; the word of God Rebuking &amp; punishing him soon converted  him to the truth He then published an Epistle to all Nations  &amp; Tongues under his dominions &amp; in all languages the perpose  of which was that God was a revealer of secrets a worker  of signs &amp; wonders &amp; an originator &amp; controler of political  power &amp; government. ##Daniel 1-4## In Babylon it was soon conseded  that the wisdom of one Revelator or Prophet was ten  times more valuable than all the combined wisdom of its  sages without this gift. Hence Daniel was wisely placed  in power as president of the Presidents of more than a  hundred provinces. ##Daniel 6:1-3## This same Daniel by the word of the  Lord afterwords reproved &amp; Dethroned Belshazer and placed  Cyrus the Mede upon the Throne of Babylon. ##Daniel 5:29-31## This Monarch  obeyed the word of the Lord so far as to restore the Jews &amp;  rebuild their City &amp; Temple. ##Ezra 1## So long as the Jews obeyed  the voice of their Prophets they prospered &amp; were free  but loosing the spirit of prophesy &amp; true religion they  forfeited their institutions laws &amp; doctrin. Hence John the Baptist &amp; Jesus Christ found them in bondage to a  Government Called Rome.    Greeks before them had manufactured their own Govern ment &amp; Religion &amp; then enforced it upon others insom- uch that the Jews themselves having lost the power of  their own religion were oblieged to submit. John the  Baptist &amp; Jesus Christ reproved all the needless trash  &amp; powerless forms of Jewish sects &amp; of Gentile titions &amp; restored to the world the gifts of prophesy visions  Miracles. which would have broaken the human  yoke reesstablished the independance of Israel &amp; made  Jerrusalem the perpetual seat of Government for all  nations.  made their Temple a house of prayer for all Nations in all  coming time He would have placed there the Eternal keys  of priesthood power &amp; Government &amp; wisdom. ^* A page missed  turn to the star^    Ages—Centuries—now fled— Politics— Laws— Religions have  multiplied- Empires— Kingdoms— States— Republics have  filled the world. But whare— O whare!— The keys powers   ENDENTRY  fled to the American wilderness to rid themselves from the corr uption of ages. Their children made a Government wise &amp;  Free. But—Alas— The Priesthood—The Power—The Religion  of Heaven had long since been lost to man— Prophets &amp;  Apostles were no more — Our Fathers knew this — And tharefore  as wise honest &amp; consistent men they refrained from man ufacturing a State Religion.    The gloom of overhanging night was pierced with a ray from  the worlds of Endless day. A Celestial spark from the heavenly  Altar was rekindled upon the Earth. The mystic veil was rent  in twain. And the fogs &amp; mysts of long Ages began to roll away  as the gloom of a long night before the rising dawn. In the midst  of the ownly great &amp; free nation upon the Earth the God of Abraham  raised up a mighty Prophet gave him the ancient keys  of Religion, Government &amp; power &amp; Restored the Apostleship  with its keys of Revelation vision &amp; Prophecy. Through the  administration of which the laws &amp; government were restored  to man &amp; his Kingdom organized upon the Earth no more  to be thro &amp; States have opposed its progress with fire &amp; sword &amp; death  but all in vain. It has waded through calumny hate &amp; oppression  &amp; blood &amp; fire &amp; martyrdom Till it organized itself amid  the strong holds of these Eternal Mountains &amp; Stood forth  a Noble spectacle for the wonder &amp; admiration of all Nations  A Government created by Heaven preserved by the matchless  power of the Almighty &amp; led and  Apostles with the keys of Revelation. The United States  were constrained to recognize &amp; sustain that which no  human power could subdue. Hence the Territorial Govern- ment of Utah. And Hence the local capacity in which  we are now siting as Senators &amp; Representitives to give  Laws to a Territory. In our Local, political capacity  Executive, Legislative &amp; Judicial we are limited to the geogra- phical boundaries prescribed by the act of Congress in this  sens our Jurisdiction is bounded by Oregon On the North  by Calafornia on the West by 37 of North Lat on the South  and by the snow clad sumits of the Backbone of our continent  On the East &amp; thus confined in its immediate bearing to a  country not much larger than the British Isles    a hill a candle on a candlestick that cannot be hid  The great the noble of heart, the Enterprising, the oppressed  of all Nations will flow to us as a continues stream  Senators Govornors Kings &amp; Rulers will cast their  Eyes to Utah &amp; to her Prophets, Apostles, Revelations  laws &amp; institutions as a model a pattern in miniature  for the renovation of the world.

In short there page torn   ENDENTRY  but the Jews rebelled against their King &amp; prefered their own powerless forms of religion.

It was then the powers of darkness triump- hed upon our Earth. Self constituted Government and human religions overran our Earth. Truth was banished  &amp; fled far away. Equity could not Enter.

The senti- ment was instanteneous in the hearts of all the quorum &amp; spoken by president  Orson Hyde, treat us with your blessings then President Young blessed the  quorum of the Twelve &amp; said they always had his blessings. And the Twelve  Apostles felt &amp; realized that the blessings of the Presidency of the Church &amp; Kingdom of God was of far more worth &amp; benefit to them than any  Earthly gift or the Treasures of the Earth their hearts were full of joy  &amp; gladness which was unspeakable at the blessing of once more having  the privilege of returning from the four corners of the Earth &amp; beholding each  others faces &amp; sitting in council together &amp; meeting with the president  &amp; his counsel &amp; receiving blessings at their hands. The Twelve left their blessgs  upon President Young &amp; his house while the Twelve were paying their respts  to President Young the band was playing a lively tune in front of the House  the quorum saluted the two bands with a Happy New Year &amp; received in  return some excellent music. The quorum then visited President Heber C Kimball &amp; wished him a happy new Year. He also received  the Twelve with Gladness &amp; gave unto them his blessings which was also highly prized. In his blessings unto them he said his faith &amp; feelings were  that no one of the present quorum of Apostles should ever fall &amp; no power  should ever take their Crown &amp; Kingdom but they should come forth in the morning of the first Resurrection &amp; be exhalted to glory immortal- ity &amp; Eternal lives, and their blessings should increase from this time  henceforth &amp; for ever &amp; they should not want bread but they should  have means to support themselves &amp; families. My Feelings have ever  been good towards this quorum &amp; ever will be. The Twelve left their blessings upon presidet Kimball &amp; household. And next visited Father  John Smith the aged Patriarch &amp; wished him a happy New Year. He  manifested much Joy &amp; satisfaction in seeing Eleven of the Twelve  Apostles beneath his roof. This venerable Patriarch also bestowed upon  the Twelve his blessing, &amp; said they should live to see the Kingdom of God ^&amp; Zion^ ess tablished to be thrown down no more forever &amp; that none of them should  ever fall but should have part in the first resurrection, no power should take their crown but they should be blessed in all their labours in  the Earth &amp; that the blessings of God should increase upon them from  this time forth both temporal &amp; spiritual. The Apostles also left their blessings upon the Patriarch &amp; his household they next visited President  Willard Richards He also received them with Gladness &amp; an open hart they wished him a Happy new year. He also gave the Twelve his blessing He believed this is a begining of an Eventful year in the History  of this Church &amp; kingdom on the Earth &amp; he believed each suceeding   year would be more &amp; more so untill the coming of the son of man He said the Twelve were ever before him in his thoughts prayers &amp;  blessings notwithstanding they might be scattered to the fore cornors of the Earth they were men of God &amp; were destined to perform a great &amp; mighty work in  the Earth &amp; they should live till they were satisfyed with life they should see light &amp; truth prevail over sin tradition &amp; Error &amp; triumph in the Earth.

In order to set up a kingdom &amp; government  in the last days to gather the 10 Tribes of Israel the Jews &amp; gentiles  &amp; all Nations break down the Romon power build up  esstablish Zion &amp; maintain it. it must be sumthing different  from any Human government or device of man it must  originate from the heavens be governed &amp; controlled by the  God of heaven led by inspiration &amp; Revelation in all of its  undertakings &amp; it must contain within itself all the blessings  &amp; covenants which God made to Abraham concerning his  seed &amp; posterity. This Kingdom is here in the valley of the  mountains it has been esstablished by the hand of God and  it embraces all that God has promised, or that is necessary to perfect the great work or all that Jew or Gentile can look for it embraces the whole of the New &amp; everlasting covenant the fulness  of the gospel, with all the power &amp; Authority of the same the  Keys of the Kingdom the endowments sealing powers the patriarchal  Matrimony &amp; the foundation laid for gathering all Israel.    Kingdom as some have supposed when they inquired of  Jesus if he would at that time restore again the Kingdom to  Israel Jesus informed them that it was not given to  them to know (even) the times &amp; seasons which the Lord  had reserved unto himself when he would set up the  Kingdom so they were not permitted to know the time  much less to perform the work They asked the Saviour  what they should do then He told them they should bear  witness of his name before both Jew &amp; gentile &amp; for  this same testimony they would have to lay down their lives the Kingdom of God was set up in their day but the people  would not permit it to remain long among them for they killed  the prophets, Apostles, &amp; Elders who preached the gospel  kingdom of God was taken from them &amp; they have fallen into darkness &amp;  Error. But now the Kingdom of God is set up for the last time  to again restore Israel &amp; you cannot force Israel even  by the sword to receive a Kingdom &amp; Laws &amp; acknowledge the  great standard which is to be set up in the last days for the  governing gathering &amp; controlling of all Israel except it  is right &amp; according to the promises made to the Fathers &amp; this  Kingdom of God when it was to appear was to be like a mustard  seed it was to be the least of all herbs but was to grow untill the   attempt to take any of the Kingdoms of the world as this great  standard out of which to build the Kingdom of God it would not  compare at all with the parable given. but when we take   ENDENTRY  in every respect &amp; contains within itself evry thing that is promis  in the great standard that was to be set up in the last days it is no  matter what this is called at the present time a church a republic  or a Kingdom. the Kingdom is certainly here &amp; in vary deed  it has commenced like a mustard seed vary small but as the seed  gathers its  &amp; take root so will this Kingdom continue to gather the good from  all Nations untill it becomes the greatest of All Kingdoms under  Heaven &amp; untill the Kingdoms of this world become the Kingdom  of our God &amp; his Christ the signs of this Kingdom are appearing in  the heavens &amp; the Earth that was spoken off by Christ &amp; the Apotles  &amp; why should not the Kingdom appear some may say I have been  Baptized Joined the church am in the Kingdom Now why may not  I go to Calafornia &amp; get gold &amp; take all the comfort I can in this  world well if one part of the Kingdom of God have a right to  go the whole have &amp; scatter abroad then whare is your Kingdom  &amp; gathering we are now in as good a place as we can get in if we were to go to calafornia we would be whare we would  be in the midst of the scum of Hell. If we should go to Cal  or New Orlens because we could get sugar for 3 cts whare would  the work of the Kingdom of God be my views are that when  we are gathered we keep so &amp; build up Temples give Endowments to  the living &amp; dead except as we go on missions abroad in the  world as the Angels would go to hell on a mission &amp; be glad to  return as soon as they got through. If you want gold build  up the Kingdom of God make Zion a city on a hill that cannot  be hid &amp; carry out the purposes of the Lord &amp; then gold will  flow in unto you from all Nations your Presidency &amp; Apostles  will then hardly have time to go out of the Temple to get their  breakfast instead of runing about to know how to get their land  ploughed so as to raise bread to eat &amp; while all Nations are brea king up. the rich among them will invest their wealth among the  institution of Zion &amp; not trust it among the sinking Nations  &amp; those that wished to save their lives will flee to Zion for safety  for they will be the ownly people that will not be at war one  with another many other Edifying remrks were mad by the speakr    this Kingdom possessed that faith &amp; knowledge that if all the  world would say they did not believe it it would not make  any difference with them for they know of its truths The  sectarian world can write &amp; say many putty things but  why do they not carry them into practice the main difficulty  is their is no nucleus around which to gather, in order to  practice what they preach. but we believe that when God said  he would set up a kingdom which should break in peaces  all other Kingdoms &amp; stand forever that He will perform what  He has spoken. The Lord has said that that Nation that  fought against Zion should be broaken in peaces &amp; utterly  wasted away &amp; while the Elders are gathering the Saints from  all Nations &amp; Kingdoms &amp; will continue untill the winding up  scene we can make some calculation what Zion is destined  to be. many other remarks were made by Brother Lyman   ENDENTRY  ternoon &amp; I preached in the evening to a full House in the 14 ward school House I also spoke upon the kingdom of God said that none of the words of the Lord spoken would retu- rn unto him void but would accomplish all that he had  declaired that the Elders were gaining more strength &amp;  confidence &amp; power, in declairing the Kingdom of God to  the world.

Follow the counsel of Brother Snow and  improve your time in study &amp; treasureing up knowledge childn should have their times of recreations for if they are kept still from seeing &amp; knowing any thing appertaining to amusements till they are 18 yars of age when they do get out they will act  vary wild. but let the children sow their wild oats do up the dancing &amp; frolicking while young that when they get older they may read the Bible Book of Mormon &amp; preach the gospel &amp; do goog good on the Earth I want to know all their is on  &amp; Hell so that no person shall know more than I do but  in obtaining this knowledge I do not wish to sin their is  no need of sin    the people to have commenced diging out the foundation of the Temple I want to lay the cornor stone of the Temple on the 6 April if the Lord will if you want to know what size I am calculating to build the Temple I will say I am expecting to break ground 150 feet by 220 And the foundation for the building to stand upon 20 feet deep &amp; 20 feet wide &amp; 10 feet high the basement story will then commence on  the top of the foundation &amp; that will be 16 feet high 8 feet under ground &amp;  on the top of the basement story. what is there here in this valley that should hendor this people from being happy I am  happy because I do not fret about any thing that I cannot  do. I wont fret about any thing what henders your praying &amp; praising God No body but your own selves if you are seeking to weed your neighbors garden you will have business enough. but this is a happy people I wish they  would prize their blessings. You have not got to mourn  as did the Ancients because their children would Apostitise turn from God &amp; be cursed Our children will not Apostitze they will not have time but will have all they can do to perform the work of God as it rolls upon them to prepare the kingdom  for the coming of Christ gather up the Nations &amp;c Then be  happy &amp; do the things required of you    to the 14 ward school House in the evening to a crouded House I took for my text the mormon creed mind your own  business I told them what our own business was to preach   ENDENTRY  weed our own gardens &amp; let our neighbors alone. dont interfere with your neighbors affairs for that is his business &amp; not ours    ENDENTRY
