 78  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.mining is all right, there is no fault with the development of the re-sources of the earth under favorable circumstances. When we came here our position demanded that the very first thing we did was to plant our potatoes and sow our wheat, or we had starvation before us; and I will here say that the Saints and the El-ders of Israel have gone before the Lord day after day and week after week, and prayed the Almighty to hide up the treasures of these moun-tains, lest even the Latter-day Saints, with all the faith they had, should be tempted to turn away from the culti-vation of the earth and the manu-facture of what they needed; and the Lord heard our prayers, and we dwelt here many years and filled these valleys for six hundred mileswith cities, towns, villages, gardens,orchards, fields, vineyards, hundreds of school-houses, and places of wor-ship, until we made the desert blos-som as the rose, and had a supply of wheat, bread and clothing upon our hands. Then, I do not know but the Elders ceased praying for the Lord to hide up the treasures of the earth  I guess they did, for very soon after mines began to be opened, and now silver mines are being worked in many parts of the Territory. A fewyears ago General Connor and others, who dwelt here, with soldiers under them, spent very many days in prospecting these mountains from one end to the other for gold and silver,but they could find none; to-day you may go over the same places, and if you dig into the earth you may find plenty of silver, and you may find it almost anywhere in these mountains.I suppose this is all right, I have no fault to find with it; but I still say that the interest of the Latter-day Saints in these mountains is to culti-vate the soil and to manufacture what [t]hey use.Through the influence of President Young we have many manufactories for wool and cotton already estab-lished in this Territory.  He has done more than any man living in these last days, according to the means he has had at his command, to establish these branches of busi-ness in the midst of these mountains.We have now many large factories in this Territory that have to stand stillfor want of wool. I want to say a few words on this subject to the wool growers of Deseret.  Instead of sending our wool out of the Territory, to eastern States to be manufactured into cloth, and purchasing it and paying eastern manufacturers a large per centage for it when brought here by railroad, I feel that it is our duty, and it would be far wiser for us, to sell our wool to those who own fac-tories in this Territory, and to sustain ourselves by sustaining home manu-factures.One of the first commands given to Adam, after being placed in Eden,was to dress the garden; and he was permitted to eat of the fruit of every tree except one.  After a while Adamand his wife, Eve, partook of the fruit of this tree, and the history of the Fall is before us and the world.After Adam was cast out of the gar-den the Lord told him that there should be a curse on the earth, and instead of bringing forth beautiful flowers, fruit and grain spontaneously, as before the Fall, it should bring forth thorns, briers, thistles and noxious weeds, and that man shouldearn his bread by the sweat of his brow; and from that time to the present mankind has had this curseto contend with in the cultivation of the earth. In consequence of this the inhabitants of Utah, in theiragricultural operations have to fight against the cockle burr, the black seed and sunflower, as well as thorns 
 COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE LATTER-DAY WORK.  79and thistles and many other noxious weeds, which, if not eradicated, speedily take advantage of us, and to a great extent, mar the result of our labors. It will pay us to pay attention to these things; it will pay us to dress the earth, to till it, to take care of and spend time and means in manuring and feeding it; it will pay us to gather out these noxious weeds, for the earth will then have a chance to bring forth in its strength. This, with the blessing of God upon our labors, has made the soil of Utah as productive as it is to-day.  I wish to see this interest increase in our midst; and I hope, in addition to this, that those who are raising sheep our wool growers  will pay attention to and carry on that branch of business systemati-cally, and that we will sell our wool to those who manufacture it at home, instead of sending it out of the Territory to be manufactured. I feel that this is our duty, and the course which will promote our best interests,and it is a principle which is true, independent of religion, in any com-munity or nation; it is a self-sus-taining principle.God has blessed us, he has blessed the earth, and our labors in the tilling of the soil have been greatly pros-pered. As has been said by some of our brethren in their remarks, when the pioneers came here, no mark of civilization or of the white man, wasfound. If those who are now so anxious to obtain the homes we have made, had seen Utah as we saw it,they would never have desired a habitation here, but they would have got out of it as soon as they could.It was barren, desolate, abounding with grasshoppers, crickets and kiotewolves, and these things seemed to be the only natural production ofthe soil. We went to work by faith,not much by sight, to cultivate the earth. We broke almost all the plows we had the first day. We had to let streams of water out to moistenthe earth, and by experience we had to learn to raise anything. The stranger comes into Salt Lake Cityand sees our orchards, and the treesin our streets, and he thinks, what a fruitful and delightful place it is.He does not think that, for twenty or twenty-four years, almost every tree he beholds, according to its age,has had to be watered twice a weekthrough the whole summer season, or they would all have been dead long since. We have had to unite upon these things, the Lord has blessed our labors, and his mercies have been over this people.If we had not cultivated the earth, but had turned our attention to min-ing, we should not only have starvedto death ourselves, but thousands of strangers, who have passed through, would have shared the same fate.Utah Territory has been the great highway to California, Nevada, and all the western States and Territories,and they have all looked, in a mea-sure, to Utah for their bread. No-body but Latter-day Saints would have lived here, and endured the trials and affllictions that we endured in the beginning; none others would have stayed and fought the crickets one year, as we had to do year after year. Any people but the Latter-day Saints would have left this coun-try long ago. Not only so, on account of the things I have already named, but I will here say that no other people could have lived here no, they would have knocked each others' brains out on account of the little water they would have had in their irrigating operations. Whenmen saw their crops and trees wither-ing and perishing for the want of water, the selfishness so general in the world would have worked up to 
 80  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.such an extent, that they would have killed one another, and hence I say that none but Latter-day Saints would have stood it; but they, by the training and experience they had before received, were prepared for the hardships and trials they had to encounter in this country.Brethren and sisters, let us con-tinue our efforts in cultivating the earth, and in the manufacturing what we want. And I still urge upon our Female Relief Societies, in this city and throughout the Territory, to carry out the counsel PresidentYoung gave us years and years ago, and try, as far as possible, within ourselves, to make our own bonnets, hats and clothing, and to let the beauty of what we wear be the work-manship of our own hands. It is true that our religion is not in our coat or bonnet, or it should not be.If a man's religion is there it is not generally very deep anywhere else. But God has blessed us with the products of earth and the bles-sings of heaven, and his Spirit has been with us; we have been pre-served, and the Lord has turned away the edge of the sword, and he has protected us during many years past and gone, and we all have to acknowledge his hand in these things.I do not wish to detain this Con-ference. I felt as though I wanted to make a few remarks on these sub-jects. I hope, brethren, that we will not slacken our hands with regard to the cultivation of the earth. In the prosecution of our labors in that respect we have every-thing to contend with that man has been cursed with for five thousand years. We should clean our fields, as far as we can, of the noxious weeds, and our streets of sunflowers.These things encumber the earth.  We have one difficulty to contend with, unknown save in those por-tions of the earth where irrigation is practiced.  It is true that a man may clean his fields of sunflowers,cockle burrs, blackseed and every other noxious weed that grows, and the very first time he waters his land here will come a peck or a bushel of foul seed from the mountains, and fill every field through which the stream flows. These difficulties we have to fight against, but we must do the best we can. As farmers, we should clean our seed, and not sow the foul along with the good.One man, in a few hours, with a good wire sieve, can sift enough seed for ten acres of land, and perhaps for twenty; while, to pull that bad seed out when grown will cost from one to five hundred dollars, for it will take a score of men days to do it. We should use our time, judg-ment and the wisdom God has given us to the best advantage in all these things.I want the brethren to come toge-ther this afternoon and elect their officers, for we desire to hold a fair this fall, in which the agriculturaland manufacturing interests of the Territory may be represented aud interested. Let us not be weary in well doing; let us not slacken our hands, either in cultivating the earth or in the manufacturing of what we need. Co-operate in agricultural and mercantile matters, also in our tanneries, and in the making of butter and cheese. One man may engage in these branches of busi-ness with advantage if he have skilland experience to guide him; but in co-operation the wisdom of all is combined for the general good. Thisplan has been adopted with advantagein other communities, cities, States,Territories and countries, and it can be in this more extensively than it has been hitherto. 
 OBSERVE THE SABBATH DAY.  81I pray that God will bless us, and bless this whole people; and I pray that the testimony which we have received here during this Conference, which is true, may not be forgotten by us.  I can bear the same testi-mony.  I know this work is of God.I know Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God.  I have heard two or three of the brethren testify about brother Young in Nauvoo. Every man and every woman in that assembly, which perhaps might number thousands, could bear the same testimony. I was there, the twelve were there,and a good many others, and all can bear the same testimony. The ques-tion might be asked, why was the appearance of Joseph Smith given to Brigham Young? Because here was Sidney Rigdon and other men rising up and claiming to be the leaders of the Church, and men stood, as it were, on a pivot, not knowing which way to turn. But just as quick as Brigham Young rose in that assem-bly, his face was that of Joseph Smith the mantle of Joseph had fallen upon him, the power of God that was upon Joseph Smith was upon him, he had the voice of Joseph,and it was the voice of the shepherd.There was not a person in that as-sembly, Rigdon, himself, not ex-cepted, but was satisfied in his own mind that Brigham was the proper leader of the people, for he wouldnot have his name presented, by his own consent, after that sermon was delivered. There was a reason for this in the mind of God; it con-vinced the people. They saw and heard for themselves, and it was by the power of God.May God bless you.  May he give us wisdom to direct us in all things,and promote all the interests of Zion for Jesus' sake.  Amen. 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.   275DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVERED IN THE 13TH WARD ASSEMBLY ROOMS, SALT LAKE CITY,JANUARY 12, 1873.(Reported by David W. Evans.)THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN -- THE SAINTS' DUTIES.My address this afternoon will be intended for those who profess to be Latter-day Saints -- those who have entered into co[v]enant with the Lord our God.  I am surrounded with those who know by experience that we are dependent upon the influence and inspiration of the Holy Ghost to enable us to teach the things of the kingdom of God.  My faith is that no man, in this or any other genera-tion, is able to teach and edify the inhabitants of the earth without the inspiration of the Spirit of God.  As a people we have been placed in positions the last forty years which have taught, in all our administra-tions and labors, the necessity of acknowledging the hand of God in all things.  We feel this necessity to-day.  I know that I am not quali-fied to teach either the Latter-day Saints or the world without the Spirit of God.  I desire this this afternoon, and also your faith and prayers, that my mind may be led in a channel which may be beneficial to you.  In my public teaching I never permit my mind to follow in any channel except that which the Spirit dictates to me, and this is the posi-tion we all occupy when we meet with the Saints, or when we go forth to preach the Gospel.  As Jesus told his Apostles, Take no thought what ye shall say, it is told us, Take nothought what we shall say ; but we treasure up in our minds words of wisdom by the blessing of God and studying the best books.We are told in the 24th chapter of Matthew that Jesus, on a certain occasion, taught his disciples many things concerning his Gospel, the Temple, the Jews, his second com-ing and the end of the world ; and they asked him -- Master, what shall be the sign of these things?  The Savior answered them, but in a very brief manner.  As my mind runs a little in that channel, I feel disposed to read a portion of the word of the Lord unto us, which explains this matter more fully than the Savior explained it to his disciples.  That portion of the word of the Lord which I shall read, is a revelation given to the Latter-day Saints,March 7, 1831, forty-two years ago next March.  It commences on the 133rd page of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.-[The speaker read the revelation, and then resumed his remarks as follows]- :I want to ask who are looking for the fulfillment of these events, and who upon the earth are preparing themselves for the fulfillment of the word of the Lord through the months of Prophets, Patriarchs and Apostlesfor the last six thousand years? 
 276   JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.Nobody that I have any knowledge of, without it is the Latter-day Saints, and I for one feel that we are not half so much awake as we ought to be, and not half as well prepared as we ought to be for the tremendous events which are coming upon the earth in quick succession in these latter days.  Who can the Lord ex-pect to prepare for his second coming but his Saints?  None.  Why?Because, as is said in this revelation, light has come forth to the inhabitants of the earth, and they have rejected it, because their deeds are evil.  Thismessage has been proclaimed among the Christian nations of Europe and America, and in many other nations,for the past forty years.  Inspired men -- the Elders of Israel -- have gone forth without purse or scrip declaring the Gospel of life and sal-vation to the nations of the world,but they have rejected their testi-mony, and condemnation rests upon them therefor."  As the Prophet said, "Darkness covers the earth,and gross darkness the minds of the people."  Who believes in the fulfill-ment of prophecy and revelation?Who, among priests and people to-day, has any faith in the sayings of Jesus Christ?  If there be any peo-ple besides the Saints whose eyes are open to the great events which will soon overtake the nations, I wouldlike to know and visit them.  I would to God that the eyes of the Latter-day Saints were open far more than they are to those things that rest upon them!  The Lord is look-ing to them alone to build up hisZion here in the mountains of Israel,and to prepare the bride, the Lamb's wife, for the coming of the Great Bridegroom.  I believe in the ful-fillment of the revelations which the Lord has given to us, as much as I believe that I have a soul to save or lose, or as much as I believe in the shining of the sun in the firmament of heaven.  Why?  Because every word that God has ever spoken, whe-ther by his own voice out of the hea-vens, by the ministration of angels, or by the mouths of inspired men,has been fulfilled to the very letter as far as time has permitted.  We have fulfilled many of the sayings of the Prophets of God.  The revelation I have read this afternoon was given forty-two years ago.  Has there been any sound of war since then?  Has there been any sound of war in our land since that period?  Has there been any standard lifted up to the nations, any gathering together of the people into these mountains of Israel from nearly all nations?  There has [.] We have had a beginning, the fig tree is leaving, putting forth its leaves in the sight of all men, and the signs in both heaven and earth all indicate the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.When my mind, under the influ-ence of the Spirit of God, is open to comprehend these things, I manytimes marvel and wonder, not only at the world but also at ourselves,that we are not more anxious and diligent in preparing ourselves and our families for the events now at our doors, for though the heavens and the earth pass away, not one jot or tittle of the word of the Lord will go unfulfilled.  There is no pro-phecy of Scripture that is of any private interpretation, but holy men of God spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost, and their words will be fulfilled on the earth.We are approaching an important time.  As Jesus once said, The world hate me, and without a cause,therefore I have chosen you out of the world, and the world hate you also.  The servant is not above his master, you are not above me, they have hated me and they will hate 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.  277you.  The Lord has chosen the Lat-ter-day Saints, and through them has sent a message to all nations under heaven.  The Zion of God is opposed by priest and people in every sect, party and denomination in Christendom.  The Elders of Israel have been called from the plow, plane, hammer and the various oc- cupations of life, to go forth and bear record of these things to the world.  We have followed this up until the present time for more than forty-two years -- forty-three years next April.  The kingdom has stead-ily grown, and while we have la-bored we have seen the fulfillment of the word of the Lord.  The sea has gone beyond its bounds, there have been earthquakes in divers places, and there have also been wars and rumors of wars.  These are only a beginning, their fullness has not yet opened upon the sons of men, but it is at their doors; it is at the doors of this generation and of this nation.  And when the world rise up against the kingdom of God in these latter days, shouldthe Saints have any fears?  Shouldwe fear because men, in their secret chambers, concoct plans to over-throw the kingdom of God?  We should not.  There is one thing we should do, and that is, pray to God.Every righteous man has done this, even Jesus the Savior, the Only Be-gotten of the Father in the flesh,had to pray, from the manger to the cross, all the way through; every day he had to call upon his Father to give him grace to sustain him in his hour of affliction and to enable him to drink the bitter cup.  So with his disciples.  They were baptized with the same baptism that he was baptized with; they suffered the same death that he died, being cru-cified as he was.  They sealed their testimony with their blood.  Never-theless all that Jesus said concerning the Jews has had its fulfillment to the present day.  This should be a strong testimony to the whole infidel world of the truth of Christ's mission and divinity.  Let them look at the Jewish nation and the state of the world, in fulfillment of the words of the Savior eighteen hundred years ago in Jerusalem.  It is one of the strongest testimonies in the world of the fulfillment of revelation, the truth of the Bible and the mission of Jesus Christ.  The Jews have fulfilled the words of Moses, the prophets and Jesus, up to the present day.  Theyhave been dispersed and trampled under the feet of the Gentile world now for eighteen hundred years.When Pontius Pilate wished to re-lease Jesus Christ, saying that he found no fault in that just man, the high priests, scribes, pharisees and other Jews present on that occasion cried, "Crucify him, and let his blood be upon us and upon our children." [##Matthew 27:22-25##]Has it not followed them to this day, and been manifest in their dis-persion, persecution and oppressionthrough the whole Gentile world for eighteen hundred years?  It has.And they have to fulfill the words of the Lord still further.  As I have been reading to you to-day, the Jews have got to gather to their own land in unbelief.  They will go and rebuild Jerusalem and their temple.  They will take their goldand silver from the nations and will gather to the Holy Land, and when they have done this and rebuilt their city, the Gentiles, in fulfillment of the words of Ezekiel, Jeremiah and other prophets, will go up against Jerusalem to battle and to take a spoil and a prey; and then, when they have taken one-half of Jeru-salem captive and distressed the Jews for the last time on the earth, their Great Deliverer, Shiloh, will 
 278  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.come.  They do not believe in Jesus of Nazareth now, nor ever will until he comes and sets his foot on Mount Olivet and it cleaves in twain, one part going towards the east, and the other towards the west.  Then,when they behold the wounds in his hands and in his feet, they will say,"Where did you get them?"  And he will reply, "I am Jesus of Naza-reth, King of the Jews, your Shiloh,him whom you crucified."  Then, for the first time will the eyes of Judah be opened.  They will remain in un-belief until that day.  This is one of the events that will transpire in the latter day.The Gospel of Christ has to go to the Gentiles until the Lord says "enough," until their times are ful-filled, and it will be in this generation. Forty years have passed since the revelation I have read was given to the sons of men.  We are living in a late age, although it is true there are a great many vast and important events to transpire in these days.But one thing is certain, though the Lord has not revealed the day nor the hour wherein the Son of Man shall come, he has pointed out the generation, and the signs predicted asthe fore-runners of that great event have begun to appear in the heavens and on the earth, and they will continue until all is consummated. If we, as Latter-day Saints, want anything to stir us up, let us read the Bible, Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, they contain enough to edify andinstruct us in the things of God.Treasure up the revelations of God and the Gospel of Christ containedtherein.As an individual, I will say that I feel a great responsibility resting upon me, and it also rests upon you.Joseph Smith and Brigham Young alone have not been called to build up in the latter day that great and mighty kingdom of God which Dan-iel foretold, and which he said should be thrown down no more for ever.  I say, they were not called to be the only ones to labor in building up that great and glorious Zion, which was to become terrible to all nations; nor their counselors,nor the Twelve Apostles; but this responsibility rests upon every one of the Lord's anointed upon the face of the earth, I do not care who they are, whether male or female, and the Lord will require this at the hands of all the Latter-day Saints.I therefore desire that we may be awake to these subjects, and to the position we occupy before God and in the world.The inhabitants of the earth may hate and oppose us, as they did Jesus Christ, and as they have all inspired men, as they did Noah,Enoch, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,Isaiah, Jeremiah, and all the pro-phets who ever lived.  They have always been a thorn in the flesh to the world.  Why?  Because they had enough independence of mind to rebuke sin, to maintain the promises of God unto man, and to proclaim the declarations of the Al-mighty unto the inhabitants of the earth, fearless of consequences.  The last song sung here was, "Do what is right, let the consequence fol-low."  That is what I say to the Latter-day Saints.  Let us do what is right, maintain our religion be-fore God, be valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ, and prepare our-selves for his coming, for it is near,and this is what God requires at our hands.  He leans upon no other people; he expects from no people but those who have obeyed his Gos-pel and gathered here, the accom-plishment of his great work, the building up of his latter-day Zion 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.  279and kingdom.  And, as I have said, this responsiblity rests not only upon Prophets and Apostles, but upon every man and woman who has en-tered into covenant with him.  I say that we are too near asleep, we are not half awake to the position that we occupy before God, and the responsibilities we are under to him.We should be on the watch tower.Who is going to be prepared for the coming of the Messiah?  These men who enjoy the Holy Ghost and live under the inspiration of the Al-mighty, who abide in Jesus Christ and bring forth fruit to the honor and glory of God.  No other people will be.  There never was a more infidel generation of Christians on the face of the earth than there is to-day.  They do not expect that God will do anything in a temporal point of view towards the fulfill-ment of his promises; they are not looking forward for the establish-ment of his kingdom, or for the building up of his Zion on the earth.  Their eyes are closed to thesethings, because they have rejected the light.  When Joseph Smith brought this Gospel to the world,there was a great deal more faith in God, a great deal more faith in his revelations, and, according to the light they had, a great deal more pure and undefiled religion than there is now.  We have carried the Gospel to all Christian nations whowould permit us, and they have rejected it, and they are under con-demnation.  Our own nation is un-der condemnation on this account.This land, North and South America, is the land of Zion, it is a choice land--the land that was given by promise from old father Jacob to his grandson and his descendants, the land on which the Zion of God should be established in the latter days.  We have been fulfilling the prophecies concerning it, for the last forty years.  We have come uphere and established the kingdom;True, it is small to-day, it may be compared to a mustard seed, but as the Lord our God lives, the little one will become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation, and the Lord Almighty will hasten it in his own time, and the world will learn one thing in this generation, and that is, that when they fight against Mount Zion, they fight against the decrees of the Almighty and theprinciples of eternal life.I rejoice before God that I have lived to hear the principles of eter-nal life proclaimed to the sons of men; I rejoice that I have lived to see this people gathered together, I rejoice in coming to the land of Zion with the Saints of God.  When we came here twenty-four years ago,we were a little handful of men, pioneers; we came to a parched and barren desert.  Since then we have built up six hundred miles of cities, towns, villages, gardens, farms and orchards; and while doing this we have had to contend with the opposi-tion of both priest and people.  Have they prevailed?  They have not, and they will not.  Why?  Because he who sits in the heavens, the Lord ourGod, has decreed certain things and they will come to pass; because the Lord is watching over the interests of this people.  He requires us to work with him, he is at work for us.It is our duty to build these temples here--this in Salt Lake City, another in St. George, in Logan or wherever they may be needed for the benefit of the Saints of God in the latter days.I think many times that many of us will get to heaven before we shall want to go there[.] If we were to go there to-day, many would meet their friends in the spirit-world and it would be a reproach to them, for 
 280  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.you, Latter-day Saints, in one sense of the word, hold in your hands the salvation of your dead, for we can do much for them.  But I think many times that our hearts are too much set on the vain things of the world to attend to many important duties devolving upon us connected with the Gospel.  We are too much after gold and silver, and we giveour hearts and attention to temporalmatters at the expense of the light and truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.We have not much time to spare as a people, for a grea[t] work is re-quired at our hands.  I know that, without the power of God, we should not have been able to do what has been done; and I also know that we never should be able to build up the Zion of God in power, beauty and glory were it not that our prayers ascends into the ears of the Lord God of Sabaoth, and he hears and answers them.  The world has sought our overthrow from the beginning, and the devil does not like us very well.Lucifer, the Son of the Morning,does not like the idea of revelation to the Saints of God, and he has in-spired the hearts of a great many men, since the Gospel was restored to the earth, to make war against us.But not one of them has made any-thing out of it yet--neither glory,immortality, eternal life nor money.No man or people ever did make any-thing by fighting against God in the past, and no man or people will ever make anything by taking that course in the future.This is the work and kingdom of God; this is the Zion of God and the Church of Christ, and we are calledby his name.  The Latter-day Saintshave to abide in Christ, and we can not do that unless we bring forth fruit, any more than the branch of the vine can unless it abide in the vine.To abide in Christ we must enjoy the Spirit of God, that our minds may be enlightened to comprehend the things of God.  When I look at the history of the Church of God in these latter-days I many times marvel at whathas been done and how we have progressed, considering the traditions, unbelief, failings, follies and nonsense that man is heir to in the flesh.  We have had a great many traditions to overcome and the opposition of the world to contend with from the beginning until to-day.  Brethren and sisters, we should be faithful.  The Lord has put into our hands the power to build up his Zion and kingdom on the earth, and we have more to encou-rage us than was ever possessed by any generation that has preceded us.  We have the privilege of build-ing up a kingdom that will stand for ever.  Noah and the Antediluvian world did not have this privilege.Enoch built up the Zion of God a little while, and the Lord took it away.  Jesus and the Apostles camehere. Jesus fulfilled his mission,preached the Gospel, was rejected by the Jews, and was crucified.  His disciples had a similar fate, and the Gospel was taken to the Gentilenation, with all its gifts and blessingsand power, and Paul the Apostle of the Gentiles warned them to take heed lest they, in turn, should lose it through their unbelief.You know how it has been with them--that there has been a falling away, and that for seventeen hun-dred years the voice of a Prophet or Apostle has not been heard in the world; and now again, in these lat-ter days, the Lord Almighty, re-membering his promises made from generation to generation, has sent Angels from heaven to restore to man the Gospel and has given au-thority to administer the same.The Revelator John, says he saw 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.  281an angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the ever-lasting Gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, to every nation, kindred, tongue and people,saying with a loud voice, "FearGod and give glory to him who made the heavens, the earth, the seas and the fountains of water, for the hour of God's judgment has come."Oh! ye Gentile nations, wake up and prepare yourselves for that which is to come, for as God lives his judgments are at your door.They are at the door of our nation, and the thrones and kingdoms of the whole world will fall, and allthe efforts of men combined cannot save them.  It is a day of warning,but not of many words, to the na-tions.  The Lord is going to make a short work, or no flesh could be saved.  If it were not for the mani-festation of the power of God what would be the fate of his Zion and people?  The same as in the days of Christ and his Apostles.  The Lord has had Zion before his face frombefore the foundation of the world,and he is going to build it up. "Who am I," saith the Lord, "that I promise and do not fulfill?"  The Lord never made a promise to the sons of men which he has not ful-filled, therefore Latter-day Saints, you have all the encouragement inthe world to sustain you in the faith that the Zion of God will remain onthe earth.  The work is in ourhands to perform, the God of hea-ven requires it of us and if we fail to build it up we shall be under con-demnation, and the Lord would remove us out of the way and he would raise up another people whowould do it.  Why?  Because the Almighty has decreed that this work shall be performed on the earth, and no power on earth or in hell can hin-der it.I would here say to our delegate to Congress, when you go to Wash-ington, have no fears with regard to the opposition of men.  You have every reason to go in confidence, and do your duty, knowing that the Lord will stand by you, and so has every man in the Church and kingdom of God, I care not where we are placed or what God requires at our hands.  He is at the helm, and he has protected us until to-day.  Where should we have been a few years ago when the army was sent to destroy us, if it had not been for the protection of the Almighty?We should not have been here.And so it will be in days to come.The world hate us because the Al-mighty has called us out from the world to proclaim his Gospel and build up his kingdom.  Let us be faithful, for the Lord is going to protect us, and build up Zion.  He will also gather Israel, rebuild Je-rusalem and prepare the way for his second coming, in the clouds of heaven.  Then let us, Latter-day Saints, wake up to our duty.  Thinknothing too hard that the Lord re-quires of us.  Let us build this Temple that we may attend to the ordinances for the living and the dead.  If we not do this we shall be sorry.  When I see men who have received the word of God, and tasted the powers of the world to come, and then turn away, I think of the par-able of the five wise and five foolish virgins.  It will pay us to be wise and to have oil in our lamps, to have fellowship with the Holy Spirit, and to live our religion and keep the commandments of God day by day.Brethren are passing away.  I have been away three or four weeks on a visit to the people in the upper settle-ments, and since my return I hear of this man and that man dead, whom I saw well and hale before I went away. 
 282  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.So it will be with us in a little while.We shall pass away and go to the other side of the vail, and the burden of the building up of Zion will rest upon our sons and daughters.  Then rejoice in the Gospel of Christ.  Re-joice in the principles of eternal life.I am looking for the fulfillment of allthings that the Lord has spoken, and they will come to pass as the Lord God lives.  Zion is bound to rise and flourish.  The Lamanites will blos-som as the rose on the mountains.  I am willing to say here that, though I believe this, when I see the power of the nation destroying them from the face of the earth, the fulfillment of that prophecy is perhaps harder for me to believe than any revelation of God that I ever read.  It looks as though there would not be enough left to receive the Gospel; but not-withstanding this dark picture, every word that God has ever said of them will have its fulfillment, and they, by and by, will receive the Gospel.  It will be a day of God's power among them, and a nation will be born in a day.  Their chiefs will be filled with the power of God and receive the Gospel, and they will go forth andbuild the new Jerusalem, and we shallhelp them.  They are branches of the house of Israel, and when the fullness of the Gentiles has come in and the work ceases among them, then it will go in power to the seed of Abraham.Brethren and sisters, let us remem-ber our position before the Lord!  Let us try and keep the faith, let us labor for the Holy Spirit, that our hearts,minds and eyes may be opened, that we may live by inspiration, that when we see dark clouds rising and evilsstrewing our path, we may be able to overcome [.] The Savior was tempted,so were his Apostles, and if we have not been we shall be.  As the Lord told Joseph Smith, "I will try and prove you in all things, even unto death.  If you are not willing to abide my covenants unto death, you are not worthy of me."  Did Joseph abide unto death?  I think he did,and he with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, will sit at the right hand of the Lord Jesus Christ, and will re-ceive his glory and crown.  He was true and faithful unto death, and his testimony is in force to-day, in lan-guage as loud as ten tho[u]sand thun-ders.  Whether it is believed or re-jected it will have its fulfillment on the heads of this generation.By and by great Babylon will fall and there will be wailing, mourning and sore affliction in her midst.  The sons of Zion have got to stand in holy places to be preserved in the midst of the judgments that will shortly over-take the world.  We can see how fully the revelation, calling us to go to the western countries, has been ful-filled.  In less than forty years, a standard has been lifted up, and peo-ple gathered here from France, Eng-land, Scotland, Wales, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and almost all the nations of the earth in fulfillment of that revelation.  When it was given no man among us knew anything about Salt Lake or the Rocky Moun-tains; but it has been fulfilled before our eyes.  We have come up here, and in so doing have fulfilled the re-velations of God, so far.  Let us continue, I pray God my heavenly Father that he will bless the Latter-day Saints; that he will give us his Holy Spirit and wisdom, that our eyes may be opened, that we may have faith in the things of God.  Let a man lose the Holy Spirit and what faith has he?  None, either in God or in his revelations, and that is what is the matter to-day.  You may take the best friends we have outside of of this kingdom, and you can hardly get them to believe that God has any- 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN.  283thing to do with the affairs of men, or that he has power to do anything for them, either as individuals or na-tions.  If their eyes were open one moment they would understand that God holds them all in the hollow of his hand, weighs them in the balance and that they cannot make a move without his permission.  They would no longer wonder why the Latter-day Saints have faith in God if their eyes were open so that they could under-stand the work and things of God.They can not understand it, they cannot even see the kingdom of God unless they are born of the Spirit of God, and they cannot enter into it unless they are born of the water and the Spirit, according to the words of Jesus to Nicodemus.I have a desire that we may be faithful in our mission and ministry,as Elders of Israel and as Saints of God, that we may do our duty, and maintain our position before the Lord.Let our prayers go up before him.  If I have any forte it is prayer to God.We are not called to build up Zion by preaching, singing and praying alone; we have to perform hard labor, labor of bone and sinew, in building towns, cities, villages; and we have to continue to do this; but while we are so engaged, we should not sin.  We have no right to sin, whether we are in the kanyon draw-ing wood, or performing any other hard labor, and we should have the Spirit of God to direct us then as much as when preaching, praying, singing and attending to the ordinan-ces of the house of God.  If we do this as a people we shall grow in the favor and power of God.  We should be united together, it is our duty to be so.  Our prayers should ascend before God, and I know they do.  I know that President Young is prayed for--I know that his counselors and the Twelve are prayed for, and that the Church and kingdom of God is prayed for.  We should continue this, and if we pray in faith we shall have what we ask for.  The Lord has taught us to pray, and I rejoice that I have learned to pray according to the order of God, for in this we have a promise--that where two or three agree in asking for any thing that is just and right, it shall be granted unto them.May God bless you!  May he give us wisdom, and his Holy Spirit to guide us, that we may be enabled to be true and faithful to our covenants,and be prepared to inherit eternal life, for Jesus' sake.  Amen. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff. No man can preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ without the spirit and power thereof no matter what his, qualities are; and there never has been a time when this spirit is more needed than now. Related incidents that occured during his missions in the world. when the power of evilspirits was made manifest, Especially on the in-troduction of the Gospel in England. Apostacy is the result of these evil influences. Refered to the great apostacy in Kirtland. Said, God will take care of His Church, of the leaders, all who hold the Priesthood; and we must sustain them, or we will go to destruction as many have. Had not Joseph and those associated with him accepted the revelation on Celestial marriage, this gospel would have been taken from the Earth. And I beleive 
 1875the same same is true of the United Order. Wecan see the hand of the Lord in the movement concerning genealogy in the Eastern States. This is the result of the revelation concerning Bap-tism for the dead. We are now enabled to trace our genealogy to all our progenitors behind the vail. The prophet of each dispensation Seals his testimony with his blood. Related his ex-perience at the time the prophet Joseph was killed. The Church has passed into a new dispensation, and our leader will not be assasssinated, all who oppose Israil will go down judges, Govenor, Presidents &c. The Mothers of Isral have the training of their chil-dren, as the Elders are from home; hence they have great responsibility 
 Elder W. Woodruff, illustrated the differencebetween the Prophet Joseph and the Rev. Drs. of the day. We are asked why the Lord chose one in ign-orance to reveal His Gospel. It was to have one who ^would^heed His word. Alluded to the mighty occurrenciscotemporaneous with the Gospel. Especially the histor-ical & genealogical Society of New England. Ifthe Prophet Joseph had refused the revelation onCelestial Marriage the Church would have stoppedthere. In all ages of the world, God has had thoseSpirits who were called before the foundation of the world through whom to reveal His will. This is thecase to-day with the United Order of which we seemto be afraid. As if God would reveal any thing forour harm. Uttered condemnation for manyof the follies & extravagances of fashion. God, theHoly Prophets and all the hosts of Heaven arelooking to us to for help. Let us do it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff spoke of the privilege of bearing a testimony. He said, the Gospel of Jesus Christ is just as true to-day as it ever was ^yet^, but very few people are independent enough to serve the Lord. This is God's work, and there are but few who can be used as the Lord desires, they would want their own way, hence the Lord chooses the obedient, and not partial thereby. Even the Apostles of the Savior were men of low degree. The Lord will prevail and nothing can stay His hand. We are to be a tried people, as we heard this morning. Yet the faithful will be saved as has been revealed, for every revelation will be fulfill-ed. Elders have compassed the world, and always been sustained. We will be held accountable for 
 1876all things we receive, for the Lord has all things. No generation before has ever had so much to perform as we have. Spoke of the organization of the church by the Prophet Joseph of its completeness and power, all of which is the result of God's providences manifested in our be-half; for it is His work, yet we must do our part. The year the baptism of the dead was revealed, a society was organized, to obtain the genealogy and history of the society as well as others. Spoke at length on this subject, urging the Saints to prosecute the work on the Temple; that the living and the dead may be cared for. I desire now to labor only with the Saints and for the dead. He said, there are millions to be cared for. 
 SYNOPSIS OF A DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVERED IN THE PROVO MEETING HOUSE, OCT. 13, 1877.(From the Territorial Enquirer.)THE WORK PROGRESSING-PROPHECY FULFILLED-WE SHALL ALL OBEY THE LAW OF DEATH.It was with pleasure I listened this morning to the remarks of bro-ther Snow, and wish that all the people in this Stake had heard them.We have had a great deal of preach-ing, and need a great deal, and I don't know that a people ever lived who had more.We are in the valleys of the mountains for a special purpose-to establish righteousness and live in accordance with the principles of truth. There never was a generation of people who had so much to per-form as the Latter-day Saints have.This work is progressing, and it will continue to advance. I have seen the time when you could get the whole Church into this room   when there were a few High Priests, no Apostles or Seventies, and only a few Elders. I am as thoroughly satisfied now as I ever was in my life, that this is the kingdom of God. I am as firm a believer in God, in the reve-lations of God, in the Books of Mor-mon and Doctrine and Covenants, as I ever was. I have read the prophe-cies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and other inspired writers, and have seen some of them fulfilled, and expect to see others have their literal ful-fillment. God worked with the children of men through revelation, and he will continue to do so in this generation. With him there is no change; his ways are one eternal round.The Lord has directed and guided this work from the beginning. The prophecies relating to the present dispensation   to Zion being estab-lished in the tops of the mountains  to the building of cities and Temples 
 THE WORK PROGRESSING, ETC. 135  are being fulfilled. We have no-thing to do but build up the king-dom of God, and the more light and understanding we get, the less our hearts will cling to outside things.While we are engaged in this work, we can realize that holy angels are watching us. The Lord told us, forty-seven years ago, what would take place, and we are now fulfilling that which he spoke of. Brothers Joseph and Brigham are gone into the spirit world, but there are a fewof us left to continue the work laid out by the Almighty. We have preached to the world, organized the Priesthood and the Saints, and angels have borne record of this, and it is recorded in heaven   our toil, our preaching, and our testimony.We have filled these once desert places with Saints of the living God,and many thousands are here who never saw the world. We have to build Temples   one is almost com-pleted and is dedicated; we have laid the foundations of others, andthe work, like a panorama, is before us. This labor is not to be per-formed by other hands. God looks to us to build these Temples, and to bring about the redemption of the earth. He holds us responsible for this work; we have to preach to the house of Israel   to the Laman-ites   to gather together the honest in heart from all parts of the earth.We are chosen to perform this great and important work-we, a small handful of people compared with the millions of human beings on the earth. The Lord does not expect any other people but the Latter-day Saints to do this work; there is no-body else preparing.One after another of our brethren have left us and gone to labor on the other side of the veil. President Brigham Young, brother George A.Smith, and others before them, have all gone, and the few that are left of the Twelve will also go by and by;but while here, it is our duty to labor on the foundation they have laid. President Young labored hard and faithful during the last few years of his life in organizing and building up Zion. We have to continue the work they were engaged in, and when our time comes to take our departure for that life behind the veil, none of us will regret having devoted our time, talents, and labor for the accomplishment of this great object. The riches of the world will appear as the dust under our feet compared with the eternal reward before us.This kingdom will never be given into the hands of another people.We may pass away, but our sons and daughters will have the labor ontheir shoulders of building up the kingdom.Many of you may have read, years before it was fulfilled, the revelation and prophecy of the Prophet Joseph in regard to the trouble, anarchy,and war that should befall this na-tion. Wise men said its fulfillment was a matter of impossibility-that the government was too sound and too well established for such a cala-mity to occur, but the fulfillment came. When the Lord undertakes to perform a work, he is certain to carry it out. It would not take the Lord twenty-four hours to cause war, anarchy, confusion, and judg-ments to come upon the nation. He is withholding these calamities untilhis purposes are accomplished.The set time has come, and the world is preparing itself for these things. The Church and kingdom of God must adorn itself, and prepare for the coming of the Great Bride-groom. Every key relating to this dispensation was given to the Pro-phet Joseph, and they remain with 
 136 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.the Priesthood today. We have no right to walk in the dark. The burden is now resting upon us, and, holding the Priesthood, our aim should be building up of the kingdom of God. We hold the Priesthood for that purpose, and we have no business to use it for any-thing else but to officiate in the ordinances of the house of God.Sooner or later we shall have to obey the law of death. As it is written, "In Adam all died, so in Christ shall all be made alive."  Weshall have to pass through the ordeal   there is no escape from it. Wehave, consequently, no time to throw away. It may be asked, "How much longer will it be before the winding up scene takes place?  It is not for me to say. How muchlonger have the Elders to sufferviolence at the hands of the wicked?It appears to me that the world is about ripe for the judgments of the Lord, and that the testimony will soon be sealed. He is already work-ing with the Lamanites, and he will accomplish a great deal in a little time.Some people entertain the ideathat because wheat is plentiful and selling at exceedingly low figures,the probability of a famine is more remote than ever; but the Lord makes no mistakes about what is going to transpire. He has decreedthe visitation of judgments, and they are certain to take place. President Young has for years repeatedly im-pressed upon the brethren the neces-sity of preparing for a period of famine by storing their wheat, and, before his death, was impressed to speak to the sisters and urge them to look after that matter. Let us be united in our labors, and in allthe branches of industry that males or females may be engaged in. Theraising of silk may be rendered an important item in the industry of this Territory. It is a business that our wives and children can engagein, and there is nothing to hinder the people from becoming rich from this branch of industry alone. There is an improvement in the United Order, or Co-operation. The Saints are preparing themselves for that event when Jesus shall come as a thief in the night. For our ownsakes let us do the best we possibly can. We must observe and keepthe laws of God, in order to inherit the rewards promised. Let us not set our hearts on the riches and vanities of this earth. It is very convenient, it is true, to have the comforts of life around us, but we shall be better without them, if by hoarding up the riches of the world we forget the things of God.I pray God to bless you and our sons and daughters, that their minds may be led and prepared for the work they will be called upon to perform. 
 Apostle W. Woodruff addressed the congregation Said.Joseph Smith was asked once by a clergaman, if all the people outside of the mormons, to which the Prophet replied yes, and one half of them if they do not repent.Spake of the great number of men and women who had joined the church, and afterwards apostatise from the church.  And lost their Priesthood, their power, Glory, dommions.Read a prayer offered up by Joseph the Prophet in Liberty Jail, in relation to the long sufferring endured by hinself & coreligen-ousts.  The general duties of the Saints was dwelt upon, and, the magmatude of the great work before us.  Spoke of great benifit the B. Y. Academy was doing in the land and hoped it would receive the liberal support of the Saints.encouraged the Young to qualify themselves for the great work before them. 
 Pres. W. Woodruff: Spoke of the dealing of God in the history of the world.  Had noticed that whenever nations departed from the paths of vuirtuue and righteousness, they were cast down.  Whenever men served God he upheld and and sustained them.  But of all the changes that have taken place from Father Adam one thing has never changed -- and that is the Gos-pel of Jesus Christ.  Referred to the mechanicalimprovements of the latter times, all tending to the gathering of Isreal in these days.  Spoke of ancient prophecy and its litteral fulfillment.Spoke of the stupendous work of the Saints in the few years they have been in the valleys of Ephraim.  Spoke of the swift judgments that would come upon those who have persecuted the Saints.  We have not got through with the warning of the nations.  I am getting more en-larged in my feelings regarding the people of the nations, we are baptizing a hundred a month in the Southern States.  The Lord will fight our battles if we will keep his commandments and build his temples.  The young men will have to bear off this kingdom.  Made a powerful exhort-tation to the Saints to be faithful. 
 Apostele Woodruff made remarks as follows. Saidthat while he was in Arizona Gen. Sherman [rewoh]was there; remarked that it was a shame for the govern-ment to charge the Mormans any thing for the land.But the time will come when we will see theblessings and wisdom displayed in sending thatthat colony. As I have often said, it seemed almostimpossible toofor mortal man to live in these valleys whenwe first come here. But we shall soon understandwhy God wants these places setted. The Lord re-quires many things of us that has not been requiredof others generations. The Lord expects us to workwith him in the redemption of his Kingdom. The timewill come when we will be required to practicewhat we teach. Important events are about to transpirein Zion. 
 BLESSINGS, ETC.BLESSINGS--TRIALS--OBEDIENCE TO COUNSEL, ETC.Remarks by Elder Wilford Woodruff, delivered in the Bowery, Great Salt Lake City,Sunday Morning, September 27, 1857,We are glad to see the brethren return home from their long missions or short ones.  We are glad to greet them, to hear them talk, to see their faces, and to hear their testimony that the Lord has been with them,  These things are a pleasure to us who re-main here in Zion.  There are a multiplicity of evidences that God is with this people, and that the Lord has been with his Elders, whereverthey have been, from the beginning of this work.There has been something peculiar connected with the Elders of this Church from the beginning.  You may take the rest of the world, poli-tically, temporally, spiritually, or any other way ; and there never has beensuch an example in the eyes of hea-ven, earth, or hell as has been in the Elders of this Church, in preachingthis Gospel to the nations of the earth.  The hand of God has been in the work from the beginning, and it is in it yet; and the hand of the Lord has been with them to succour them all the time.  The revelations given from heaven, through Joseph, concerning the Elders, have been fulfilled to the very letter.There are many things that are consoling ; and one is, to know that the Lord is with us that he does reveal his mind and will in the ordi-nances of the house of God, and through the administration of bles-sings, whether by Patriarchs, or by the Twelve Apostles, or in the endow-ments.  We find those blessings are fulfilled to the very letter.The brethren to-day have spoken in reference to the blessings that are given to our brethren when they go out on their missions to the various nations of the earth.  I remember the day very well when we blessed those missionaries that went to India and to Europe; and I must say that I never had such a variety of feelings as I had at that time.In blessing brother Luddington, I recollect that I was mouth, and I well remember that I could see nothing but seas, waves, and storms.The seas appeared to be heaped up,and I knew that he was going to see storms and be exposed to troubles and dangers.  But there was one thing that we did bless those brethren with that I rejoice in, and that is that they should return home again.Well, our words have all been ful-filled to the very letter, and this gives us consolation.  If we go forth, and have the Priesthood and Apostleship upon us, the Holy Spirit of God, though it may not be visible, does dictate to us; and it is so in ordaining:  it is so in going to battle against the nations of the earth, who have given their consent to the shed-ding of the blood of the Prophets.Brother Brigham feels calm and serene as a summer's morning; and in his desire to save Israel he wishes to save also the lives of our enemies,if possible.  Why is he so calm and 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.steady?  It is because God is with him; and though armies are ap-proaching and ready, apparently, to swallow up this people, yet he and his brethren feel calm, and the Lord reveals unto them, by the Holy Spirit,how to govern and control this people.They have had a long experience in proving the Almighty God, who holds the destiny of the Saints and the sinner.  And has he ever failed us?No, never.Some of our brethren have told their trials here to-day, and they have said that they have not done much;but the greatest work they have done has been in saving themselves.  But this is not all they have done.  They have done something else; they have accomplished the purposes of God in India as much so as though they had baptized every king and queen in those islands:  they have literally fulfilled the revelations of Jesus Christ in carrying the Gospel unto them, because those nations could not have been left without excuse and the earth prepared for the judg-ments of God, if those Elders had not gone and preached to the people of those nations.  No matter if they had not have baptised one, they are as much justified as we who first went to Herefordshire, England, and bap-tised twenty or thirty priests in a day.  They have fulfilled the com-mandments in carrying the Gospel to the nations.It is no testimony to me that a man is not faithful, because he has not baptised numbers of princes, lords, governors, and kings; not at all.  The Lord has sent them there: he has tried them and put them in strait places; but has he left them?No, he has not.  Has he not brought them forth?  We have had the testi-mony of brother Musser, who is here;and we see that it is the hand of God that has been over them, and we are glad of it; and we do not expect that the Lord will send the Elders out there again until they have other missionaries and messengers that they cannot stone, tar, or feather, but mes-sengers that will come with their sharp sickles:  then they will find that they have messengers that they cannot conquer or overcome.I feel to rejoice in these thingsand to know that the Lord is at workwith this people.  We are living in a fast age an age fraught with great events, and every day is bringing to pass more of the predictions; and more revelation is being fulfilled in one year, now, than has been fulfilledin centuries before.  We are living in a day when that flood of revelation is coming to a focus; and that focus we stand in, and we are seeing it fulfilled day by day.The wicked rage and the heathen imagine a vain thing; and they say, "Let us go and take a prey and a spoil; let our eye be upon Zion, and let her be defiled."  But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither under-stand they his counsel.  God willwork for us and defend us, if we do our duty, and Zion will soon be free.We will not suffer the oppressions of our enemies as we have done.You need not fear: all we have to do is to be passive in the hands of the Lord, and follow the counsel of our leaders, and not be particularly anx-ious that the Lord should reveal to you or to me his mind and will and intentions concerning our present difficulties; but pray earnestly that the Spirit of the Lord may be upon those men who stand at the head.All we have to do is to live our reli-gion; and when the Presidency say "Come here," or "Go there," let us be on hand to obey, and all will be right.Let the people be quiet and praythat God may reveal his mind and willto those at the head.  We may have our ideas of what we should do in this 
 BLESSINGS, ETC.or that case; but there is no man so well qualified to lead, govern, and direct for the salvation of the people as that man whom God has appointed.We have as good leaders as we need.There never was a better leader given to Israel, nor one more capable of leading this people to salvation, thanBrigham Young: he is filled with the Spirit of God day by day.  If the United States make war upon this people, the Lord will hold them re-sponsible for it, and the measure they mete will be measured unto them again; and if they are ripe and the cupof their iniquity full, they will be shat-tered to pieces--their union broken up and destroyed.  They will be visited with thunder and lightning and hail and the judgments of God; and every man that will not draw his sword against his neighbour will be obliged to flee to Zion.  They are sending their armies here to destroy us; but I ask none to weep for Utah or spend their sympathy for us not even my relatives or the priests, the doctors, lawyers, or editors; no, not even one soul from the President of the United States down through the whole nation,who have given consent to our death;for they will have plenty to bear them-selves, and they may save their weep-ing for themselves and their children.The Lord will teach them that their proud looks and haughty feelings will be laid low.  It is right to pray and it is right to keep our powder dry.  Pray for the Presidency of this Church--pray for them to have the Spirit of revelation.  We have never seen a day when "Mormonism" was taking such a stride as it is at the presenttime.  They may come over the Plains singing their songs about what they will do when they get to Utah; but many of them will find a place in hellbefore they get here.There have been many truths taught here to-day.  Many who have been here for years do not know or realize the great blessings we are enjoying inthese valleys of mountains. Our gra-naries are filled with bread and we enjoy peace and the comforts of life.We come to the Tabernacle of God and associate with holy men, and we should be holy ourselves: if we are not, it is our own fault.You have all the blessings which the celestial kingdom and laws of God impart unto men on the earth, while the Gentile nations have suffered ruin,wickedness, and abominations of every kind to increase in their midst untilthey are ripe for destruction.  Do they not thirst for the blood of the Saints and every man who is righteous?  Do they not delight in wickedness?   They are full of wrath and anger, and they are ripe for the damnation of hell.Yes, the nations of the earth are ripeto-day.Then we should be faithful and diligent in all things committed to our charge.  Even though the Lordhas suffered some of the brethren to go through strait places, in days which are past and gone, and he may stillcall us to go through strait places, yet he will sustain us when we trust in him.The Lord has suffered some of our Prophets and Apostles to be martyred; and what for?  That the cup of the iniquity of the nations might be fulland that his servants might be crowned heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ to a martyr's crown.Through the persecutions of theenemies of truth, many of the Saintshave been worn out; but, as a body, the kingdom and people have been led off as victorious conquerers. We stand now and hold the keys of the Americancontinent; we stand in the Strong cham-bers of the mountains; and can theLord God give us the Victory? Hecan and he will, and he has been pre-paring us for this by pouring out upon us his Holy Spirit, uniting the peoplewho have been willing to repent and 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.forsake their sins; and I hope we shall continue faithful to the end.I am glad, and my soul rejoices in these things, and I believe that the people are ready to shoulder their guns and walk into these kanyons and line them from here to Fort Bridger in defence of the Constitution of the United States and the rights which both the laws of God and man guar-antee to us.We have had to stoop to our ene-mies heretofore and bear many things from them worse than death; but if there is anything that gives us joy and consolation at least, I can speak for myself it was when I heard the bre-thren say, "You are free, brethren you are free; and you may prove yourselves before God and men that you are willing to defend yourselves against tyrants and oppressors."When I heard this, I was full of joy; and who would not be?  Who wouldnot rather die than bow down to the yoke of the enemy?  It would sweeten death to a man to know that he shouldlay down his life in defence of free-dom and the kingdom of God rather than to longer bow to the cruelty of mobs, even if the mob have the name of being legalized by the nation.I thank God and I rejoice that this people are determined to be free frommobocracy and oppression, and that they are determined to have peace, if they have to fight for it; and if the yoke is ever put on again, it will be by our- selves: and I say, God bless this peopleand the missionaries that have gone to the nations no matter whether they have baptized one or a thousand,if they have done the will of God.Notwithstanding the lightningsmay flash, thunders roll, and earth-quakes bellow, the Lord will extend his hand over his servants and protect them as he has done those that have returned unto us.  And the Lord will remember our brethren that are on the Plains; and let us remember them in our prayers, that the Lord may be on our side; and let us be on hand and be ready at any and every call, andthe kingdom will spread abroad, and it will smite the image not only on the toes but on the head; which may God grant for our sake.  Amen. 
 Report of the four months ending April 30th 1878after which Elder W Wordruff spoke on theunity of the faith and action among the truebelievers in the Gospel of Christ and the des-position of man in all ages to oppose its ex-istence 
 At 2 P.M. Meeting resumed Apostle Wordruff  introduced his remarks with the Quotation "Straight is the Gate and narrow is the way &c reverting tothe task of the Saints in keeping the path of theGospel beset with temptations, which would be overcome with the help of God and faith in his strongpromises to help those who confided in him. spokeof the rapid growth of the work in Joseph's day specialRevelation was given in regard to special individualcalls for missionary service while now large numbersare called and set apart for Missionary Service onaccount of the demand for their Labors being so great 
 Apostle W Woodruff: refered to the teaching's ofthe Prophet Joseph Smith relative to warningsand impressions recieved at times which shouldbe acted upon relating incidents of impressionsrecieved and acted upon during his life whichhad saved his own and the lives of others. 
 Apostle W Woodruff  followed on the bleessings theobservance of the Law of Tithing brought to theSaints. blessed as we were so apparent to thetraveller passing through our midst, we shouldbe careful to discharge this law and also meetall obligations promptly that confidence may be maintained 
 Prest Willford Woodruff followed, referring to the great advantages the Latter-day Saints of the present age had over all the people to whom God had previously manifested himself and the Gospel, more Revelations were given, more inspired men lived to instruct the people, which together with the easy access to the inspired works, the Bible, Book of Mormon,and Doctrine and Covenants, made a combination of instruction that no other people had prior to the present day. 
 Prest  W Woodruff: then addressed the congregation dwelling upon the great blessings enjoyed by the people through their obedience to the laws of the Gospel, referring to the rapid growth of the people in acquiring the comforts of life around them, the wonder of the nations at the success that attended the work and the bitter end of many of those who had from time to time opposed the work citing individual cases, exhorting the people through their knowledge of these facts to live faithful to their covenants. 
 Prest W Woodruff  then addressed the audience expressing himself in strong terms "that the time had come when the Elders of Israel must pratice what they teach in order to effect upon the minds of the people," especially should it be or in regard to the Word of Wisdom: concluding with "I view you Brethren holding the priesthood as chosen before the world was, to work here upon the Earth to support his cause. 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 30, 1888.Elder James W. Bean,Stake Clerk, Utah Stake.DEAR BROTHER:Your communication of the 27th. inst., addressed to myself and theQuorum of the Twelve, informs me that, in accordance with a resolution adoptedby the unanimous vote of the priesthood of Utah Stake, you send your communica-tion asking for ten thousand dollars -[$10000.00]- of the tithing of the Stakefor the current year, to aid you in the completion of the Utah Stake Tabernacle.The position of the Church in financial matters is such at thepresent time that it is impossible for us to comply with this resolution. Weshall have to strain every nerve and use all the means within our possession,or that is likely to come into our possession for some time, to meet the engage-ments that are already contracted. In view of this, the Council of the Apostlessome weeks ago decided to cease making appropriations, for the present, for thebenefit of any meeting houses in our settlements. We have had a number ofapplications since then, which we have filed away, to be taken up in their orderwhen circumstances become more favorable. The case at which the Council stopped 
 was one that appealed very strongly to their sympathies, but it was thoughtthat it was a good place to stop at, as there would probably be no other casethat would be likely to call forth aid more strongly than it. The presentprospect is that we shall need all the tithing tahat we can collect to meetoutstanding engagements and to pay our currect expenses; and if we can do thiswithout contracting debts, we shall feel happy.Trusting this explanation will be satisfactory to the priesthood ofUtah Stake, and regretting the necessity which compels this line of action,I remain, Your Brother,Wilford Woodruff 
 CopySalt Lake City, UtahApril 7, 1881Dear Bro. John W. Young,Elders Erastus Snow, Brigham Youngand Jesse N. Smith were appointed last fall by the First Presidency of the churchin counjunctionwith yourslef to take charge ofthe interests of the saints and the care andoversight of all their parties which might beworking on the lines of the Denver and Rio Gandeand Altantic and Pacific Railroad in grading,furninshing ties, laying track +c, and to makecontracts and to asist in making contractsin their interests, and instruct and counsel them in the duties of their religion, and in the management of their busness affairs,and in securing the means that should be due to them upon their contracts.  A Letter of Instructions was written by the First Presidency for the guidance of these Eldersand yourself in the duties assigned to you,in which you were directed to do everything necessary to give all equal rights in the variousjobs and you were instructed to see thatthe supplies should be provided Rubyechto the action or adjustment of the Variousboards, no one man, or a few men to receivethe profits there from and that everythingwas to be done in the mlerch of all.  That 
 Letter said"I wish to impress upon you and the brethrenwho will labor in the conjunction with you, thatit is not the privelege of any man or companyof men to take advantage of the circumstancesof the people and their necessities and farmthem out for their private profit.  As latterday-Saints we are all equal, and we should labor for each other's benefit--and no man should selfishly build himself up or enrichhimself at the expense of his brother orbrethren.  If he has superior advantageseither of position or of skill, let him havea fair remumeration there for;but beyond this he should not go.  He should labor as we all should for the welfare, advancement and prosperity of the people.  In this way good feeling will be maintained and the saints will see that their leading men are their truefriends, and are not disposed to oppress themand to make mechandise of them.  There is freahroom for the mereaso of confidence in thisdirection, and we hope that you will dr use all your influence in creating their con-fidence and in showing your brethren that we have their true welfare at heart.  If wetake this course and act together in this manneramong ourselves, and maintains the same principlesof equity in our dealings with other who are 
 not of us, the reputation of the Latter-day-Saints will be greatly increased and influencewill be created in our favor that will result in incalculable benefit to us as a people, for the world is so destitute of these qualitiesthat when people witness them they are im-pressed by theim and recognise and acknowledgetheir worth.as to yourselves, for the labor hwich you perform among the people in counselling, indirecting, in securing contracts and in seemythat all the business is properly alleuded to,and that the pay can be relied upon, youshould derive a reasonable percentage.  We have thought that in view of all the expensesconnected with the labor, five per centwould be a proper amount; but of coursewhen you many other agents secure contractsand perform other labor connected there with,for this small percentage, it should not beexpected that you will, in the event of the company failing to make payments, be responisblefor the Day."since the return of the elders Erastus Snow and Brigham Young we have leaned that  they and Borther Jesse, N. Smith submitted a memorandum in writing to you embodying some of the principal points of the letterof instructions and requiring you to hold 
 sacred the money received in estimates for gradingless the maount necessary for to pay forsupples furnished and sking for [your] actionon your part with them in securing to thesub contractors just dues under the contractsmad eiwhtthem by Elders Brigham Young and Jesse N. smith.  Mis. Memo: they signedand requested you to sign, but we are in-formed you declined to do so, thought, you had telegraphed, upon receipt of the letter of instructions that youaccepted and would be governed by the provisions of that letterand this was, and is the under=standding of the entire Council res=pecting your telegrams to Brother Brigham.  Viewing your action in refusing to sign this memorandumsubmittd to you as a vioationof the Letter of instructions anda breach of faith with the Coun=cil, and a departure from your expressed agreement, the Councilof the Twelve Apostles has de-cided that it could not presentyour ame at the Conferenc etothe people as a counsellor.  It was therefore omitted without

The Council has also decided that you be summon=ed to appear before it in this City forth with to show causewhy you hould not be dealt with accorning to the laws of theChurch for this conduct.

I feell if I should (holdmy peace the verry stones would cry out) you accusehim of intxoriaation in Philladelphia, and of pleadinginocent as to his his getting intoxicated, this I know is falseas them stroct told it, he has told me every circum-stance concerning his being taken by the watchmanhe had got fatigued and sick traveling from Pittburgin those dirity Secltion Bats that he came in, and sethimself down to rest a while, (having no money to gethim a lodging) he got a sleep and when the watchfound him he thought he was some suspicious lookingperson, and for the sake of the fee which he knew he wouldget he took time to the wash him to the wach house notwithstandingmy Husband told him he was inocent and forthat reason told him who he was, and showed his papersto proove it.  But as it was the Officer prooved to bea latter Saint then those that bore the name, he gavehim money to help him on his journey, for ^he^ repented ofwhat he had done, he did not stand back as those holybrothers did but he saw he was in distress and administeredto his wants.

 Washington City Jan. 17th [18]50Dear Brother,Your kind favor of the 10th was received yesterday. The intelligence fromthe valley is quite cheering.  The discovery of a coal an iron are of far more value to us than a goldmine would be. Since my arrival here I havebeen pretty busy among grave Senators, impulsiverepresentatives of the people, and other functionaries.Business progresses very slowly in Congress, the organ-ization of the House is not yet completed, thoughmore than six weeks of the session have alreadypassed. Though there is scarcely a ray of hope ofour admission into the Union as a State, the prospectof our obtaining a territorial ^organization^ is far from beingdiscouraging, and an influential Senator hasgiven me encouragement to hope that we may beauthorized to elect our own officers. Some timeago I understood that Mr Stanton of Kentucky hadreceived a remonstrance to our memorial.  I suspect-ed its character and called to see him, he kindlyfavored me with a perusal of it. It charges uswith a number of the foulest deeds & abominationsin the dark catalogue of crimes, and is signedby William Smith and thirteen others.  MrStanton was very friendly, but deemed it his dutyto present it in the House.  On the 31st Ult.

 enough to have brought him along comfortable but Dudlyhad none therefore my husband devided with him to the lastcent before he got to Philadelphia, Dudley promised to getmoney there and pay him, but instead of that he shipedhim there, and left him without money or friends.That is a speceman of the dealings of laterday saints. butI thank my Hea^v^enly father that the time is a comingwhen he will meet his accusers face to face then willit be known who is the mi[s]erable slanderers' and theinocent shall then be made known, And let OrsonHide beware! God will not alway have an unriteousjudge over his people, nor will those that would walkuprightly suffer persecution, Prehaps you may think Iwrite this with some bitterness of feelling, I have reason toI have seen enough of their dealings with my Husbandand I can hold my peace no longer. So long as my Husbanmoney to give those dear brothers, and a home for thenmonth after month it was all well enogh, but whenhe was reducted in his circumstances by fowllowing themwest by the mob, and sickness and he had nothing moreto give; then he must be cast off as not worth saveing.This looks like buying Salvation with dtoo dear a priceand if we are ever saved I trust it will be withthose of better principles, as to the papers you allude toI knew not that he had any if hear I will find them andburn them for they can be of little use to him, as he has to workat his trade, to support his family besides there is no-one here thatheran would hear the Doctrine praeached, and I should hear to 
 Underwood of Ky. electrified the Senate by the presentationof a copy of the same remonstrance in the Senate.The honorable Senator was somewhat excited, gavea synopsis of its contents, thought the charges aughtto be investigated, and moved its reference to theCommittee on Territories of which he is a member.The other remonstrance was also presented in the Housethe same day, an abstract of which appeared in thepapers the following morning, and created consider-able sensation. The same evening I called at JudgeUnderwood's, but he was absent, however the next morn-ing I had an interview with ^him,^ and another two or threedays afterward, explained matters to him, and gothim pretty well satisfied.  I also called on theChairman of the Committee on Territories in theHouse, and other members,and with the review ofcounteracting the effect it had produced and wasproducing I deemed it expedient to have the enclosedarticle published in the Republic, the government organand afterward called on the editors of ^the^ Union,Globe and National Intelligencer, and requestedthem to republish it while they did, two of themwith some prefatory remarks. Immediately afterthis I received, and I thanked God for it, MrKinkead's account, and other favorable intelligencefrom the valley, which I have had published inthe four principal papers of this city.  I omitted tomention that Mr. Underwood at the time he presented 
 what he said just as soon with out the papers, as with them.I would never hurt my Husbands feellings by leting himsee the letter you sent if he has not allready seen you as heproposed to do, ^when he^ whent away, I epect he is on his returnnow in a vessel that malled from this port.God: forgive me if I say any thing amiss, but when I think howmy husband was respected before he came in to this Church, inthe Baptist church to which he belonged he was beloved as amember, and looked up to as one of the pillars of the church andnow he must be belied by a set of misecrents that is not worthyto carry his old shoes after him, and as long as I can speak I willnot hear my husband so belied as I know he has been and hold mypeace, this you may tell Orson Hide on any one else.  I know howmy husband was treated in St Louis by the Presideing Elder and otherwould be  [page torn] ask Brother E T Benson he knows my husband betterthan any one else and prehaps will render a more just account.I do not blame you for I well know by whose instignation it is thatyou speak as you do, and I hope I shall not say anything to hurt yourfeellings but you must be ware how you condem an inocent manwho posesses more soul than as many of those (insignificant beings Icould mention) as could stand between here and the salt lake.Prehaps if my husband was here he would not allow me to write asI do but it is my first feellings from the impulse of the momentI would like to have you write to me and give me such coulnirelas you think I need and the progress of the church for I have heardnothing since I left St Louis last fall, give my love to sisterwoodruff for I e^s^teem her as a worthy woman ask he to writemeYours Respectfully  Cynthia Dam 
 William Smith's memorial, he also read a paragraphfrom a newspaper accusing ^us^ with having arrestedGen Wilson, Pomeroy and others, and imposing a dutyof 50 per cent on all merchandize brought into the valley.  Senator Truman Smith informed me on Sat-urday evening that he had just received a letterfrom Gen Wilson ^who spent some time in the valley en route for California^ in which he spoke of our peoplein the most flattering terms, that he had really usedstrong language, that he had written to the Presidentenclosing Gen Wilson's letter, and when he returnedit, he would publish so much of it as relates to Deseretand its inhabitants with some remarks of his own.I shall have it immediately republished in all theprincipal papers of the City.  I shall send youa copy of it.  I have addressed a note to the HonorableSenator to-day, requesting him to give it publicityat his earliest convenience.  I was presented to thePresident some time since, and stated to him theobject of my visit to Washington, his reply was, "Thatlies in the breast of Congress." A report has recentlybeen in circulation to a limited extent, that thePresident had said at a dinner party at the WhiteHouse that he would veto any bill that may bepassed for the benefit of the Mormons, and I havereason to beleive that it is not entirely withoutfoundation in truth, but notwithstanding thatthere will be no difficulty in that quarter I beleiieveon what I regard as excellent authority.

 month, exerting his influence in our behalf.Do not be surprised to learn that this Union maybe shaken to its centre before the close of the presentsession. The South is determined that the "vexedquestion" of slavery shall be disposed of, and intheir own way, and the North seem equally determin-ed not to yield an inch. One Southern ^Senator^ said to menot long since "ninety nine to one but the Union willbe disolved" Another Southern Senator told me that just before New Year that this question was now tobe settled, and was to take precedence of all otherbusiness The South have been caucusing, but they have not been able to agree among themselves. They can-not all be brought to unite on Mr Calhoun or onany other man as their leader. In compliance withan ivitation I visited Col Benton, who was quitefriendly, and said it was clear that we aught to havea territorial government. I have also had an inter-view with Mr Calhoun who is a very agreeable andaffable man, and remarked that we should havethe same chance as other territories. When our memorial & consti-tution were presented in the Senate, Gen. Cass came to meand said, "I shall go for a state, your folks can managea state as well as anybody else". William Smith's memorial hasprevented me from seeing Mr Clay and Mr Webster whichhowever I shall do very shortly. I have an excellent littletrait by Brother Parley, which contains a synopsis ofour faith and Doctrine, which I distribute, and preach tomembers of Congress and others whenever a favorable opportunitypresents itself--I visit Mrs McLean, the lady of one of the judgesof the Supreme Court of the United States, once a week to instructher in the principles of our faith and doctrine. She has readthe Voice of Warning & Brother Spencer's Letters, with which shehas expressed herself highly gratified. She is now reading theBook of Mormon, & a little work entitled the Book of Mormon proved.  She hasa Spirit of inquiry, and her interest in the work is increasing.[Sideways text]Remember me to Sister Woodruff, and accept for yourself theassurances of your friend; J. M.

 Washington City March 22, 1850Dear Brother,I hope you will excuse my delay in replying to your last favor, my time since its reception has been very much occupied. Ourapplication for a government over the valley ofthe Great Salt Lake and the adjacent region,has given me many anxious moments since myarrival in Washington. There is not a shadowof a doubt that we shall not be admitted into the Union as a State. But the Hon Truman Smithhas proposed to me a plan for a territorial govern-ment, which authorises us to elect our own officers,and the Central Government to pay their saleries.This would do admirably well, Judge Douglasshas proposed a plan somewhat similar, whichis to legalize our present constitution and formof government Either would entitle us to adelegate in Congress, but not Senators It is how-ever exceedingly doubtful whether Congress canbe induced to grant us such a government.If we get but an ordinary territorial government,I entertain but faint hopes, from my knowledge 
 of men and measures here, that the Presidentwould nominate such officers as we wouldelect, and if he did the Senate would notconfirm them, and if they did, they would atany moment be liable to be removed, andwould almost certainly be when the presentincumbent of the Presidency goes out of office.There are already hungry office hunters here who are seeking for the offices in the event thatwe get a territorial government, and if somewhippersnappers or broken down politiciansshould be sent out, who would not be acceptable to us, to tyranize over us, we should certain-ly be brought into collison with the GeneralGovernment, and if a common territorial government be given us, and we should not acceptit, it would be rebellion, and we shouldbring down upon us the indignation ofthe whole nation, and measures would betaken to enforce it, and it is superfluous forme to tell you what the consequences would be.For these reasons I have, after much anxious reflection and serious deliberation, come almostto the determination, If I find that Congress will 
 not grant us such a form of government aswill authorize us to elect our own officers,to withdraw our application for a government,at least temporarily, until I can see the authoritiesin the valley, or hear from them. We can getalong very well with our provisional govern-ment, until our population is sufficient toentitle us to admission into the Union as a State,and this would be carrying out the President'swishes. Now, dear brother, I want youto [tel]l me candidly what you think ofthis matter, and whether I should, in your judgment, in the absence of instructions fromthe valley, be warrented in adopting this courseI need not add that as early an answer as you canmake will be acceptable Brother Babbitt hastaken his departure for the west.Your friendJohn M.

 vallies, and from 1 to 100 in the mountains makes a hard winter;but we have lost but little stock in comparison with last year. Thesnow in the vallies has gone off so gradually, the ground is thorough-ly soaked 3 feet deep.  I do not know how much deeper. Spring has brokeupon us mild and warm, the top of the ground is beginning to be dry,but the wells are raising.Every kind of fruit trees; from the apple to the currant, are loadedwith fruit buds, and some of the Peaches and Apricots are ready to blossom.I think it will be a fruitful year, for all kinds of fruit, grain and veget-ables. The cottonwood canal is nearly finished; it has been a great job.I expect the stone will come floating to the Temple, they are nowhauling with cattle. The Temple foundation is surrounded with stonecutters who make rich sweet music. I expect after conference there willbe several hundreds cutting stone, and the Temple will be pushed.We have had a great Reformation this winter, some of the fruitsare, all have confessed their sins either great or small, restored theirstollen property, all have been baptized from the Presidency down: allare trying to pay their Tithing, and nearly all are trying to getwives, until there is hardly a girl 14 years old in Utah, but whatis married, or just going to be. President Young has hardly timeto eat, drink or sleep, in consequence of marrying the peopleand attending to the endowments. I never have had so much to doin my life. I would think it would wear him out. There has hardlybeen a ball or party for recreation through this Territory for the last6 months. I have attended a meeting of some kind about every eveningthrough the past winter, & have not visited your family much, nor any body else,not among my own but little, for 5 months. I generally get to bed about 11 or 12 o'clock. I have never 
 seen this people feel the importance of living their religion as much asthey have done the past winters. I hope it will continue. the powerof God has been with in preaching and teaching in all the Quorumsand Ward meetings. I commenced with J. M. Grant before he died,and after his death the burthen [burden] of the care of the Missionariesrested upon me and bro. F. D. Richards: who was unwell consid-erable but attended most of the time. L. Snow and O. Hydehave been with me a part of the time. The Presidency and Twelve(except my self) and about 100 others are expecting to go on a summerTrip North to Salmon river.This Spring A. Lyman & C. C.  Rich will be with us aboutthe first of May. I expect they will take a European mission, somemissionaries will be called to Europe, and to the islands. PresidentYoung would like to send a mission to Siberia and the Japan-ese islands. The Lamanites are doing well, Arrowpeene andKanosh with other chiefs are making great improvement. Arrow-peene preached a short discourse in the Tabernacle lately, itwas good.We have given up the Lead mines after making about 10 or12.00 lbs. it is quite expensive and does not work as well as expected.a cotton company are called to go to the Rio Virgin. We are going totry the chinese Sugar cane this summer as far as we can get seed.All is peace and prosperity with us throughout this Territory.some are going to California this Spring, several in the Southernsettlements have started on the short roads, [or] cut off to go there,and no doubt some others will follow them soon.  Your familyare all well, you and the brethren associated with you are 
 earnestly remembered in our prayers.As far as the History is concerned, we finished matters up tothe death of Joseph as far as we could; then brought up the othermatters including the history of the Twelve up to the organizationof the church Augt. 8. I then have taken up the history of Brigham Young and his fathers family briefly, and now am at work on thehistory of the Twelve, from their first organization in a brief form,taking all that belonged to it, up to the 8 August 1844. We haveno trouble now with the Gentiles here in court or anywhere else. Itwould amuse you to read one of the late scenes while in court filedin our office too lengthy to insert with Dr. Hurt, Gen. Burr andsome smaller fry, to bullyrag all our laws and their defenders, a part of them came armed with colts, revolvers, it ended in T. S. Williams resignation and Gen. Burr's dismissal from the Bar; andsome others who intended to use the pistols went out of the housein the form of a sled using the seat of their honor for run-ners, dropping their loaded weapons while going out, which theynever afterwards found. all has been quiet since, having but littlelawing on hand.Please not expose my succatash letter to the press, forI write for your own benefit and amusement, not guarded as I wouldwhile writing to men who publish papers.Gen. Burr has written to the department as we areinformed, accusing us of cutting off and wasting the government timberin the Kanyons. I expect he will have an invitation this Spring of going to the upper mill in big cottonwood kanyon, and takinga ride down to Jordan on the top of a big pine log, (if he can stay on thetop of it) and when he has finished his trip, if he thinks it will not costall it is worth to get it, we will pay to Government all that is over, leavinghim to be the judge.Yours trulyW.

We prefer that thenames in these lists should be arranged alphabetically, but if this isinconvenient, the report can be made out by wards, with the names in eachward placed in alphabetical order.With kindest regards, we remain, Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F. Smith 
 President Woodruff - Then addressed thecongregation.  Said he felt thankful tohis Heavenly Father that he had livedlong enough to speake to so manypeople in Provo.  The Saints must notexpect too much of an old man, ashe with all the Servants of God, wasdependent upon Him for all he done.He had lived in the history of thisChurch some fifty six years, and itwas a marvel to him that he stilllived considering all that the Churchhad passed through, but this is Godswork, and He will uphold it, andHis servants who will obey Him.Bore his testimony that God hadrestored the Holy Priesthood in this dis-pensation, and that He will accom-plish His work according to thewords of His inspired servants.Showed that the work and people ofGod had always been opposed by theinhabitants of the earth: showing alsothe awful consequences upon the nationswho have, and who will shed the bloodof the Lords anointed. He desired the 
 1889March 4ththe year 1888, was read.President Wilford Woodruff Addressedthe Conference.Said we heard this morningfrom Brother Cannon some things whichare of great importance and comfort tothe Latter-day Saints, and we shouldtreasure them up. Spoke of the mannerthe Gospel was restored to the earth inthis dispensation, through the youthfulProphet Joseph Smith, showing that hisname was had for evil among the nationsof the earth the same as that of the Saviorwas in His time. Showed the great workthat God had accomplished through theinstrumentality of the great Latter-dayProphet and his associates.The speaker then read Section 121 of theDoctrine and Covenants and desiredit impressed upon the minds of the Lat-ter-day Saints. He then showed how thejudgements of the Lord had been dealtout to those that had afflicted His Saintsnevertheless the Lord will chasten Hischildren from time to time, untilthey serve Him acceptably.He called upon all the Saints to gobefore the Lord, in humility, and prayfor those things which they need and whichZion needs: for we will have manysevere trials to pass through, and allwill need strength from the Lord.He exhorted the Saints to receive andcarry out in their lives, the counselsgiven them in this Conference and beearnest and sincere in keeping the com-mandments of God; and prayed forthe blessings of God to rest upon the con-gregations of the Saints. 
 Saints to understand that we are passingthrough an experiences all of which is infullfillment of Gods purposes, and warnedthe people not to follow after the things ofthis world, for they will fail them; butit will pay them to be united, and striveto keep the commandments of God, up-holding and sustaining His work.He especially exhorted the Saints in UtahStake to be united, as he felt they neededthis exhortation. 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff Refered to the revelationsgiven to St John, as giving the history of the worldfrom his time down to the end of the world, makingmanifest the judgements of God which will bepoured out upon the wicked, also showing thatthe Gospel of Christ would be restored through themanifestations of angels.  Bore his testimonythat the Gospel has been restored, to the LatterDay Saints as was portrayed and they occupya much different position in the world from therest of man kind and therefore they shouldwalk uprightly before the Lord and keep allHis commandments that our fellow men seeingour good works will glorify our Father in Heaven 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff Expressedhis astonishment at the small assemblyof the Saints which had coneved thismorning especially when Provo alonecould fill the Buiding to overflowing ifthey people would turn out. Said hewalked 30 miles in winter time to attendmeeting where he could meet the Eldersof the church and thought if these Saintscould only realize what was before themand the importance of the work theywould have been out to hear the Brethrenof the Priesthood. 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff, Said BrotherJoseph F Smith had given the correctpattern in which the affairs of the Priet-hood are [chosen],  the one ordained  andappointed of God, and before theconference closes the Saints will haveKnow who the Lords wants to fillthe Presidency of this Stake.He desired to speak uponprinciples connected with this workwe do not understand our true relat-ionship to God, and to each other,spoke of his-feelings and prayersregarding the work of God, in his youthfor he was convinced the the minsters ofthe time were unauthorized to admin-ster the ordinances of the Gospel ofChrist.  Refered to his early exper-ences.  And acquaintance with theProphet Joseph Smith, and his BrotherHyrum and he knew.  they were instru-ments in the hands of God. to establishthis great work; God is with thispeople, and He will not punish^ermit^ anyman to lead this people astray. There-fore the saints can set their hearts at rest on that point. He invockedthe Blessings of God upon this peopleand upon all Israel that they mayunderstand their true relationship toGod and to echach other and this work 
 Prest Woodruff Refered to hisexperience in the early history of thischurch, showing the great obstacle^cles^which the Saints and especially theleaders of the Church had to contendwith and overcome and many more wereovercame by the adversary of all truth.Showed that the same po^e^rsons andinfluences are still laboring to over comeand destroy this work and it [Chases] theSaints to become more fermly unitedin this great work, and labor for the salvationof the human race, and the establishmentof the Zion of our God. 
 Woodruff. was glad to here the reports from the different wardspoke of the difference inbetween the Saintsand the outside world. ^it is^ every laturday Saint duty to help build Temples we have no time loose in building up the kingdom of God said he had raveled 45 years with Prophet and apostals asked the People if they [y] though he prised these blessing we havent got much time to redeem our deadsaid he never had a doubt of this work, wished he had a gift to teach the young spoke aboutenmity between thes out side world has against this People wished the People to be united as the heart of one man spoke on general Principles.

 Apostle Wilford Woodruff was pleased to meetwith the Saints on this Conference. Felt likesaying what the Lord whgave him whetherit be much or little. He felt that the Gospelis as good to day as when first revealed to theProphet Joseph Smith. I some times thinksaid that speaker, "that the Elders in Israelforget who they are and what their destinies ^are^.God us to bear off this work in triumph.He said we have no time to sell or drink liquorand the time will come when a man willnot be allowed to admister the sacrament or enter into the temple, who uses either oneor the other. There is no time to be lost thisgospel must be preached to every nation,kindred, tongue and people befor Jesuscomes in His glory. 
 Apostle Woodruff.  It has been asked some-times, when a person has been called ona mission What has he done? now wewant it understood that the doctrine ofChurch is not to send men on missionswho have committed sins, but thosethat have lead pure lives.Spoke of the Elders in performing missionsin the early rise of this Church; they hadit to do or come under comdemnation.The speaker gave much valuable instruct-ion which was listened to with deepinterest by the many people that were pres-ent. 
 The speaker asked, Has God ^gone^ a journey? "Haveall those revealations been fulfilled?" What are thepeople aposiatizing for? "No man with the Spiritof God will turn from the truth."The speaker earnestly exhorted the Saints toawake from their slumbers and put on thebeautiful garment, to keep the Word ofWisdom, to keep the commandments ofGod, and repent of their sins. He dealt withpleasure upon the working of the UnitedOrder in Arizona, where he had spent histime for something more than a year.The speaker stated that he visited many ofthe Lamanites in Arizona and conversed withtheir chief, and leading men. Found themanxious to hear the Word of the Lord andto learn something of their forefathers. Theyare industrious, ecanomical, and clean.

 Aleppo, Turkey Feb 21st 1894Prest. Wilford Woodruff.Dear BrotherI write you in relation to a matter thatis the cause of much trouble to us here in this branchof the church. Dispensing with preliminaries and to bebrief I will say that we have an Elder here by thename of Geo. A. Vizerian who is giving us much troubleas follows In the latter part of Dec. last,while residing at Aintab in the performance of my mis-sionary labors I recieved a letter signed by all of theSaints except about three, asking me to come here (Aleppo)immediately as there was trouble existing in the church.On my arrival here I found them to be in a sadcondition. There was considerable enmity between ElderVizerian on the one hand and the two Priests and the Saintson the other. Things had been going from bad to worseuntil a short time previous to my coming, when the Elder,(Vizerian would come to meeting on Sunday, administerthe Sacrament and the Saints refusing to partake of it,he would say they were all damned and call them ap-ostates etc. and dismiss the services and go away.I did not think it wisdom to enter into a judicialinvestigation of the matters for fear of iritating or wideningthe gap between them, so I appointed a meeting andafter reminding them that we all had our faults andimperfections succeeded in having them all ask 
 forgiveness of each ^other^ promising to forget the past and livebetter in the future. I thought we had made a perma-ment reconciliation but it has proven not to be so.As I have now learned the facts I find the trouble cameabout in this way.About two years or more ago, Elder Vizerian, the two Priests,and some of the Saints now here were living in Aintab.An elder by name of Garoutch was presiding over them.Elders Garoutch and Vizerian told the Saints that they wereprophets, and Garoutch had a revelation, or revelationsfor their guidance; and he did many things that did notreflect any credit on the Latter Day Saints. Some monthsafterwards he (G) became insane, and some months laterdied a violent death. The American physicians afterexamination, by his convulsions etc. pronounced hisdeath to be by poison. There seems to be some mysteryconcerning his death, of which Elder Vizerian knows butrefuses to divulge.The Priests and some of the Saints did not believe in therevelations of Garoutch whereupon he denounced themas apostates etc. Since Garoutchs' death Elder Vizeriandenounces all who speak against him (G) and his revel-ations, especially one of the priests whom he calls aJudas, and they remained away from church.Now that they have removed here, the troubles ar[e] renew-ed here of course. Elder Vizerian has been presidinghere with the results as above stated, until my arrival. 
 He has been keeping the books, tithing etc.After our reconciliation as stated above, the saints desiredand elected or sustained unanimously a brotherHagopian as clerk to keep the tithing accts etc.When Elder Vizerian came to turn over the books andfunds on hand he took his tithing and donations forseveral years past out of the fund and refused to turnit over. For the only man here holding the higherPriesthood to act in such a manner hurt the saints verymuch. To my questions as to why he did so he wouldonly answer that he acted according to the dictates of theSpirit. I could only with much difficulty apease theindignation of the saints and I felt it my duty to say thata non-tithing payer was not in good standing or fellowshipand according to Church order should not be allowed to ad-minister in any of the ordinances of the Gospel, which Ihave carried into effect, knowing that the saints would notrecieve administrations at his hands.For two months past we have been holding meeting threeor four times a week having a little peace then turmoilalternately, caused by this elders' actions and sayings.He comes to the meetings and sits quietly, but every opportu-nity he has he condemns the saints and prophesies thattrouble will come upon them (not saying what the troublewill be) and thus keeps up an agitation that will giveus no rest. Two nights ago at 12 oclock midnighthe baptised two young men and administered Sacrament 
 to them etc. without my knowledge or that of the saints.When I learned of this I told him that under existing circum-stances he should not have done so, that the saints here normyself did not approve it, to which he said "I do notcare for you, the church or any man so long as God com-mands it me." When I ask him for evidence that I mayknow that he is commanded to do these things he onlysays "I bear my testimony to you that it is true: if youwish to know more ask God he will tell you."He is an unmarried man and together with a youngman named Geo. live in a house by themselves, wherethey have dreams and visions almost without number.From his mysterious sayings and actings actions Iinfer that he thinks they are those two prophets that are tocome on this continent; in fact I am told that he has saidso. Astounding as this statement may seem I verilybelieve that he considers themselves to be such, and hedoes not hesitate in telling me that all things are madeknown to them.I say nothing against the manifestations of the Spiritfor personal advancement and benifit, on the contraryI advocate it, but I understand from Doc & Cov's thathe only who stands at the head of the church can recieverevelations for the church: else order would be subverted.He told me to day that he was spiritual president of thechurch here, I was but temporal. I was not inclinedto believe, although I heard it said many times, that he 
 thought himself a prophet until I accidentally sawa copy of his letter to you dated about Jan 12 or 13th [18]94in which he speaks of those two prophets.He since told me several times that he expected a letterfrom you, shortly, which would open my eyes to thingsimpossible to believe now and which would accountfor all his peculiar actions. I think you will under-stand his short, mysterious letter better after readingthis. I think his letter was written to you upon thesubject mentioned for your approval and confirmation.I present this case to you because he will not submit itto any lower authority, considering himself above any butyourself and agreeing to abide by your reply to his letter.You will have perhaps have answered his letterbefore this reaches you. If you have understandingit fully, I hope it may settle our affairs here.If you did not understand it fully or have not yet an-swered it, I ask you to do so at your earliest convenienceand let it be direct and emphatic that he may have aplain understanding of the same that we may be en-abled to establish peace and harmony, for a continuanceof affairs as we have had them for the last two monthsor more will soon lead to the utter anihilation of thisbranch of the church. I ask you to answer this com-munication with all the instructions you deem it nec-essary for me to have upon this matter, or any others,also a copy toof your reply to him. 
 I ask these things only if in your best judgement andby the dictation of the Holy Ghost you see fit so to do.I remain your brother inthe Gospel of Jesus ChristF. A. Huish.PS.

 my labors that I may show my gratitude for the great favors the Church has bestowed upon, by doing some little service for my Church and my bretheren.I feel regret that I was not permitted to enter the Templenor to receve a portion of the Priesthood in Zion, so that if I should die I would have been anointed and been in the Temple. It seems that God did not see fit this time; but if I live and God permits me I shall come with my family.Perhaps the Lord did not open the way this time that I might constantly desire to bring my family to ZionI belive that gGod will permit 
 me to see that day. I also disireyou to pray for me that this maybe so.I received your telegram onSunday Mar 10th and today Ireceived the money and I shallget my ticket and leave onthe 330 train this afternoonfor Brooklyn.

 Provo City, June 12  [18]89President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In conformity with Circular No. 4, and given Noticeof the Secretary of the General Board of Education, the threeappointed Examiners met with the Graduates for NormalCertificates, at the B. Y. Academy, Provo, Monday, May 27,at 9 A.M. Sixteen, that is 14 gentlemen, and 2 ladies, reported.There were two more who had previously announced their in-tention to graduate, but one was taken ill, and the other wasprevented from attending by a death in the family. It had beendecided by the Board of Examiners to have the first three daysdevoted to the written examination, and the questions, (copiesof which are herewith enclosed to be placed on file by theSecretary G. B. S.,) which had been previously submitted byeach one of us to the Board of Examiners for approval, wereplaced successively on the Blackboard, and were workedout by the Graduates under my own supervision. Everyanswer received its percentage, the total of the wholeset making the total of efficiency in that respective branchtogether them with the total in the practical and oral examinationin the same study. A Graduate considering himself as 
 by any of the Examiners in any one point, should have theright of asking for an explanation, and if then not satisfied,of an appeal in the case to the Board of Examiners. Severalexplanations have been asked, which, however, proved satis-factory in every instance, and no appeal became necessary.It had been decided that in case of the Percentage in GeneralEfficiency should fall^ing^ below 60, no Certificate should beissued. This occurred only in the case of Michael Barclay, 49%.That man is absolutely unqualified for a teacher; his answersin Grammar, Theory of Teaching, and Geography, seem almostto indicate a partially unsound mind. When he reportedhis intention to me to graduate, I cautioned him privately, buthe is so full of his own conceit that nothing could con-vince him of his incapacity. He only attended the Acade-my one term some years ago, failing them entirely. I havealso notified all Graduates that fell below 75% in anyone branch to pass another examination in that par-ticular branch next ^under one^ year, until they reach an efficiencyof at least 75%. During Thursday and Friday each oneof us three held oral and practical examinationssimultaneously in separate rooms, having a class 
 of schoolchildren (30 in number) divided between us forthat purpose. Saturday morning we spent in consul-tation and arranging the statistics of our Examination.The results of which have been put into the hands of theSecretary in the form of a Schedule. As there may be casespresenting themselves during the summer, or the next school-year, of persons soliciting examination; we have proposed,therefore, that any one of us three, residing or being inthe region of country of said person, might be commissionedby the chairman of Examiners, upon due application havingbeen made in time, to hold that examination, each oneof us furnishing the questions pertaining to this department.If this arrangement should meet your approval, our workmay be facilitated considerably in such cases.As the B. Y. Academy commences Aug. 5, and you havegiven me the privilege to remain with that institutionthe first 10 weeks for the purpose of organizing andstarting the Normal Department in conformity withthe requirement of Circular No. 4, I shall be at libertyto travel wherever you should desire me to go, on orafter October 11 or rather October 4 already, the tenth 
 week being Conference week. I should desire to visit thenorthern Stakes, where churchschools are, during the hotterseason and take the South during the fall and winter,if possible. As President Geo. Q. Cannon has granted methe privilege to have my name retained as Principalof the B. Y. Academy for the next year, I shall draw upthe Circular for that institution, meet with the newlyorganized Stake Board, and make with them such ar-rangements as the interests of the institution maty re-quire during the protracted periods of my absence afterthe first ten weeks. By a private letter from Bro. Benj-Cluff, now at Ann Arbor, I learn, that he is inclinedto come home at once, if his services would be requiredand a suitable salary could be promised him. It doesnot seem wisdom to me to make any more assurancesand promises of definite position or salary before en-tering the churchschool-service, which step should al-ways be taken by the candidate bonafide, nor couldwe venture to place any man into s such a responsibleposition as the Principalship of the B. Y. Academy is,nor in on coming directly from the East, before we have 
 ascertained to what extent his spirit and methods havebeen influenced by his eastern sojourn. I h Thus, I think,Bro. Cluff might work himself into it as my deputyduring my periods of absence, until he can take it all.That was partly the course Bro. Tanner pursued after hisreturn home and before going to Logan. In other respectsBro. Cluff would be preferable for that position to anyoneelse I know of. I also understand that the authoritiesof Bear Lake Stake have made ouvertures to Bro. Cluff;to be the Principal of their Academy. These Bear Lakepeople have done so many queer things educationally and otherwise that I do not wonder at that course so muchat variance with the instructions contained in theCirculars. The next four weeks will have to be spent most-ly at my office in order to have everything arranged in orderby July 15th, when the Records should all be straight, andthe annual Report to the General Board be made.The remaining three weeks, at least a portion of it, I hope to usefor some much needed recuperation in the mountains.With constant prayers for your welfare I remain Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser 
 Provo City, July 17 89President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,The telegram of Bro. Reynolds, concerning those Stakesthat have not yet secured Principals was just received.In answer I report as follows: Bannock  Stake Academyat Rexburg has not reported, but it is presummed that Bro.Spori with his Assistant, Bro. Nielson, will continue, althoughthe former is just now on the Underground in consequence of the unfortunate test oath trouble. To Cassia Stake BoardI have written today in answer to Bro. Thos. E. Harper's letter sent to me by Bro. Reynolds and among other points sugges-ted to them the name of Bro. Geo. Cole, who graduated thisspring before the Board of Examiners and lives in thatStake. Oneida Stake Academy at Franklin has not yet re-ported nor has asked for a successor to Bro. Cornwall,retired on account of ill health. Bear Lake Academyat Paris has not reported. Box Elder Stake Academy hasno Principal and does not know how to pay one as theysay. I have transferred Bro. Jos. J. Anderson from thereto Sevier Stake Academy at Richfield, and Bro. Hayes,resigned on account of taking a course in the Sciences. 
 Office General Board of Education. April 4, 1889.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In compliance with your letter of March 2nd, instruc-ting me to visit the Stake Academies at Salt Lake,Logan, Brigham, and Ogden, I started on the thusappointed circuitvisit Thursday, March 21, andhave the honor to submit herewith and subjoined re-port of the work assigned me.All necessary appointments in regard to my in-tended visit having been made with the respectiveStake Boards and Faculties, and having placed my-self at their disposal for any good they might thinkI could do while with them, for the cause of true edu-cation, I met with the Salt Lake Stake Board ofEducation, Thursday, March 21, at 8 P.M. PresidentAngus M. Cannon presiding, all members of theBoard, and the Principal, Prof. Talmage, present.During the progress of the meeting, a petition of thisStake Board to the General Board was called upagain and read. The Secretary stating that it ^had^ had beenduly forwarded a long time ago but no answer hadbeen returned. The purport of the petition was thesuggestion, upon the advice of the church-attorneys,that the General Board should take at once propersteps to in corporate the Stake Board of Education,as many very important property questions wereinvolved. It was also stated that difficulties hadarisen in regard to the name of their Academy,and a majority of the members seemed to favorthe name of Brigham Young Academy, to assure 
 continued.Bro. Barnes, Chairman of the Kaysville Local Boardof Education, wrote to me applying for a Principalfor their "Academy". I have answered him, thatI supposed the Board of Education for Davis Stake had fully approved of their organization this being the case,the name of Bro. Allison, their heretofore district schoolteacher, so he is an entire stranger to me, and whom theydesired for their Principal, should be presented to theStake Board also for approval. If on their requested,that Bor. Allison should write a letter of applicationto me signifying his intention to enter the Churchschool-Service, which letter should be accompanied by aBishop's Certificate of his standing in the Church, aCertificate of Efficiency of his Normal training fromwherever he had graduated, and any testimonials forhis practiced labor as a teacher which he may have.Then I should notify him when and where to reportfor his examination by a Representative of the Boardof Examiners, in order to obtain a Certificate withoutwhich he could not assume the duties of that office.Davis Stake Academy in Farmington has correspon- 
 the benefits of certain bequests. The members ex-pressed themselves much satisfied with the labors of thePrincipal of the Academy and of his Associates.Friday, March 22nd. I attended the classexercises of the Salt Lake Stake Academy, in Theology, Grammar,Arithmetic, Physics, and a General Theological Classin the afternoon. If the unappropriateness of the premisesof this institution for educational purposes, par-tially over some by many clever makeshiftarrange-ments, would only be the cause of some inconve-nience for teachers and students, this circumstancewould be entitled to but a passing remark in mypresent report, but ventilation as well as light are sodefective that the health of the students, in spite of the great caution and vigilance of the Principal,is continually endangered. Although the exceeding-ly narrow stairs caused some crowding of studentsduring changes of classes, the discipline and order-in the general management of the exercises deserveshonorable mention. The students seem interested intheir studies, their answers were bright and readilygiven, and their written work very commendable.I found the Daily Programme judiciously arran-ged, and the Plan of Studies carefully followedby the teachers. In the Faculty meeting at the closeof the school in the afternoon, the reports of thePrincipal and teachers showed to me a united fandharmonious feeling in spirit and method ofteaching. The general prospects of this Academy,intellectually and spiritually are exceedingly en-couraging. Although the singing of the Academy 
 continuedded with me about a Principal. I proposed to themthe name of Bro. Joshua Greenwood as Principal, whohas since then visited there and the preliminaries forhis engagement has already been made, pending thefixing of his salary, he demanding $800. I do not thinkthis organization of a seperate "Academy" at Kaysvillein so small a Stake a wise move. A secondary schoolas a feeder for their Stake Academy, should have beena better plan. I am afraid there is local jealousy atthe bottom of it, and it forebodes no good for theeducational interests of that Stake. The 18th WardL. D. S. School has proposed Bro. David R. Allen asPrincipal, and Miss Mattie Snow as Lady Teacher.I have submitted that case to the S. L. S. Boardand they write that they had no objection to Bro.Allen, provided he complies with the regulationsfor churchschool-teachers, set forth in Gen. Circ: No. 4.I have written Bro. Allen in the same manner, as Irequired Bro. Allison at Kaysville to do. WithRandolph, Morgan, and Coalville arrangementsfor the continuance of their former Principals have 
 Choir was creditable, the vocal art of Singing has notyet recieved that attentionin this institution which itsimportance demands, and the engagement of aSinging teacher for next schoolyear should forma point of earnest consideration for the S. L.S. Board. I regret that I had no opportunity to makethe aquaintence of this lady teacher, Ms. Mattie Hughes,and ^therefore could not^ confer with her concerning her labors amongthe female students.  The S. L. Stake Board havemade great efforts in preserving scientific apparatus andmany valuable recommendations for the benefit ofthe Academy. By special request I delivered a lecturebefore the Students' Society that Friday evening,which was well attended.Saturday, March 23rd I arrived in Logan atnoon, and was informed at my arrival that I wasexpected to lecture that evening before the Polysophi-cal Society of the B. Y. College. The subject havingbeen previously agreed upon. Although scarcelyrecovered ffrom a severe spell of sickness, andsuffering under the affects of a cold I endeavered toperform that duty to the best of my ability, andwas rewarded with a very appreciative audience.Sunday, March 24, I attended the Missionarymee-ting of the Collegestudents in the forenoon, andcannot express myself warmly enough in com-menting upon the Spirit pervailing in thatmeeting, manisfesting itself in the singing,prayers, and testimonies of the young people.After attending divine service in the afternoonI spent the remainder of the day in conversing 
 continuedbeen made. I understand that Tooele Stake has erected a fine Academy building at Grantsville,and that they desire Bishop Wm. Collett one of mydear old Graduates, to be the Principal. But neitherthey nor he have mentioned anything to me aboutit. Bro. Wootton, Chairman of the Wasatch Stake Boardhas conferred with me in person and in writing, sta-ting that they are vigorously striving to have everythingready by October 2 for opening. We promised to meetagain and I am waiting for his communicationin order to make a suitable selection for a Principal,as for various reasons a very careful choice for thatStake has to be made. Springville L. D. S. High Schoolis without a Principal; Bro. Simon Eggertson the for-mer occupant of that position, having been calledto the position of Bishop's Counsellor in the II Ward,Provo, will goin teach the District school in that Wardby general request. The Local Board have not yet ap-plied for a successor hoping to persuade Bro.Eggertson to remain with them. Ephraim andFilmore Academies retain their Principals like 
 with the Principal and some teachers of theCollege about the affairs of their institution in orderto obtain as thorough an information in regardto their station as words could convey. Monday,March 25, was devoted entirely to witnessing the class-exercises, in Theology, Rhetoric, Grammar, Mathe-matics, Geography, Reading, Theory of Teaching,General History, and Penmanship. Although onlythe Principal, Prof. Tanner, and one of his teachers, Bro.Todd, are Graduates of our [Normal] Academy, and,therefore, thoroughly posted in regard to our methodand system of teaching, it was very gratifying to ob-serve the readiness with which especially, their the teachers of Mathematics, Bro. Kerr, has identifiedwith himself with the new plan of teaching.The premises and accomodations of the Collegeare excellent both in regard to senitary as wellas disciplinary arrangement. The Ladies' Depart-ment, comprising ^also^ a Library and Readingroom,in charge of Mrs. Jennie Tanner, constitute a promi-nent feature in this institution. In Music, bothinstrumental and vocal, the B. Y. College standsahead of any of the institutions in our Church-schoolorganization, and I commend Bro. H. Wahl-strom as a Music teacher of highmerits. The VocalArt should raise great attention throughout ourChurchschoolorganization, and I should suggest tothe General Board to make this branch of studyan object of special recommendation in thenext Circular. Since the appointment ofProf. Tanner as Principal, the B. Y. College has 
 continuedLogan, Salt Lake, and Provo. There is, however, acircumstance arising in Mt. Pleasant, which I haveto report to you. Some time ago, Bro. C. N. Lund, of thatplace, wrote to me for instructions in regard to the estab-lishment of a L. D. S. school in that there as an offsetto the sectarian schools which they are ifflicted with.I told him to apply to their Stake Board for permissionto organize and then I should take pleasure in assistingthem to the best of my ability. It appears, however, thatPresident Peterson is afraid that a local institutionat Mt. Pleasant will interfere with the developmentof their Stake Academy at Ephraim, and refuses hisconsent. There is now ^[being]^ at Mt. Pleasant, Bro. Geo. Chris-tensen, who graduated with the highest honor this springbefore the Church Board of Examiners. He taughtformerly a Grammar School at Mt. Pleasant, isa favorite with the people, and carries an enormousinfluence with the young people. They are nowafraid that I will call that young man awayand give him a prominent position in one of our Academies, and implore me not to make 
 undergone a very thorough reorganization in orderto bring it more into line with our another church-schools, a change, which naturally should suggesta corresponding retardation in the regular andaccustomed advancement of the students. It givesme great pleasure, however, to state, that the general-ity of the students not only seem to be reconciledto the new regime, but appear to have enteredinto the spirit of it with vim and delight.By mangement, Bro. Samuel Cornnell, Princi-pal of Oneida Stake Academy, at Franklin,Idaho met me at Logan, and I learned fromhim following points of interest concerning hisAcademy: His health has been greatly im-paired by overtaxing himself. He had only alady teacher to assist him, who was not acquain-ted at all with any systematic way of teaching.He had no maps, charts, or any utensils of con-sequence to assist him in his labors, and noapparatus of any kind. Over 100 studentsin atendance.  He gave a public examinationwhich was highly commended upon. Thepeculiar situation of the Saints in his neighbor-hood has had a depressing effect uponthis new educational enterprise at present.He is worn out, intends resigning at theend of the present term, and take anotheryears's Normal Course as a Postgraduate. 
 continuedany appointment for him, until they would writeagain, trying in the meantime to get Pres. Peterson's con-sent. I should plead this cause before you, that youmight assist them by your counsel. Bro: AllenR. Cutler, Principal of Panguitch Stake Academywrites, that the Stake Board there has concluded tokeep their Academy only 30 weeks per year, and thatthey would pay him monthly at $7500. Bro. Cutleris not willing to continue under such conditions ashe wants to be employed for the whole year, herather will go to the Academy at Provo and studythe higher courses I wrote Bro. Allen with the requestto submit my letter to that Stake Board also, statingthat Pres. Woodruff did not approve of limitingthe school year to such an extent, and that I hadno Principal that would be willing to acceptposition under such a condition. We expected ourteachers to be employed all the year round, willnot to be compelled to travel around the countryas bookagents, serving [machine agents etc.] a [portion]of the year to make a living, or keeping strolling 
 In meeting with the Faculty of the B. Y. College, on Mon-day afternoon, I found the Daily Programme ju-diciously arranged, the progress in the exercises re-gistered weekly, and the plans and instructionsof the Principal conscientiously observed. A con-traction in the number of instructors for nextschoolyear seems to be desired, and Bro. Apperly,who is also County Superintendent of Distr. Schools,intends to retire from the College. On accountof the absence of most of the members, a meetingof the Stake Board of Education could not beheld, but it was suggested by Bro. Geo. W. Thatcher,that the members of that Board could meet at SaltLake during Conference. The title of College forthis institution is at yet somewhat inappropriate,but the facilities of the school are so excellent,that by judicious management the Collegestatusmay be obtained within a comparatively shorttime. I arrived at Brigham City, Tuesday, March26 at 2 P.M. and was hospitably recieved andentertained by Apostle Lorenzo Snow. A meeting hadbeen appointed in the Tabernacle in the evening, inwhich by request I addressed the congregation onthe objects of our churchschoolorganization in gener-al and ^of^ the Box Elder Stake Academy in particular.The fornoon of the following day was devotedto attending the class exercises at the Academy usedto meeting with the Faculty at the consultation.The Faculty had consisted of the Principal, Bro.Jos. J. Anderson and three Assistants, of whom twohowever, have retired on account of the contraction 
 from place to place, term after term, or year afteryear, teaching after a fashion, taking root no where,benefitting nobody, and accomplishing nothing.last week until last Monday I was in Beaver for a"rest". My son Reinhard has concluded to remainanother year as Principal. I met twice with the StakeBoard, and procured them an Assistant Teacher inthe person of Bro. Daniel Beck, and of our last Spring'sGraduates. The Academy will occupy the so called IIWard Meeting house until after the end of the Septemberterm of the District Court by Nov. 1 when the new Courthouse is to be occufined and the old promisses of theAcademy will be vacated. Kanab Stake Board willbe ready by October and will write again for aPrincipal, when all arrangements have been per-fected. I ahve been compelled to recall Bro. Oscar Vance from the District school at Parowan, and tosend him to Ogden at Assistant to Bro. Moench. Bro.Vance being one of our most intelligent church schoolteachers will be an indispousable acquistitive to theWeber Stake Academy at Ogden. This move being 
 of the Programme to suit the reduced number ofattendance. The Principal as well as his Assistent,Ms Sadie Tanner, are working by a carefully de-vised Daily Programme, are following closelytheir laid out Plan, and register their weeklylabors acording to instructions. Several classeshad to be reconstructed at the beginning of thepresent term on account of the change of teachers,but it was gratifying to note the readiness withwhich the students had accommodated them-selves to the new classification. This is the first, orexperimental year of this Academy and, likeall new enterprises, has to establish its reputationmore corresponding influence. The good begin-ning made will furnish the institution afair starting for the next academic year. Bro.Anderson, being a young man, has needed sev-eral times kind words of encouragement to arousehim from a growing despondency in regard tothe work assigned him. A very interesting Board- meeting was held the previous afternoon, whichwas attended by Pres. Lorenzo Snow, the Principal,all the members of the Board but one, and bymyself. The Principal complained of lack of ap-paruyus, maps, and books, of sufficient prepar-ation of students on entering the Academy, andthe frequent changes of the teachers. The members ofthe Board expressed sucessively their satisfac-tion with the teachers and their determinationto advance the interests of the Academy. TheBoard intends to enlarge the premises and the [illegible] 
 the number of classrooms for next schoolyear.The prospects of this institution are bright and thereis no doubt that the people of the Stake will pat-ronize ^the institution^ in future to a great extent. Wednesday,March 27, I started in arrived with the afternoontrain at Ogden, where I was cordially receivedby President Shurtliff, and conveyed to his house;to recuperate before the meeting of the StakeBoard in the evening. My health being some-what impaired. The meeting of the Stake Boardof Education, President Shurtliff presiding, washeld in the Courthouse and was attended by all themembers. The amount of tuition formed a greatpart of the discussion,  as it had to be fixed very low in consideration of the peculiar sitution ofeducational affairs in Ogden. They have accom-modation just now for about 1575 students,and have three rooms at their disposal. Thenecessity of a schoolbuilding of their ownwas declared to be very urgent, and Pres. Shurt-liff intimited that he had a scheme, althoughnot yet fully matured, to obtain one. The em-ployment of a Ladyteacher, and of a teacherof Music was recognized as a matter ofgreat importance. The entire schooltime onthe following day from 8 A.M. until 4 P.M.was spent in witnessing the classexercises ofthe Academy. There was only the Principaland his first Assistant, Bro. Waldram, in attendance; his second Assistant, Bro. E. Cutler,one of the Normal students of the B. Y. Academy

 had suddenly been called to Provo to the bedsideof a brother supposed to be dying. Consideringthat Bro. Moench has been out of practice fora number of years, his classwork, consistingthus for mostly of the intermediate grade,is very satisfactory, and some points which Icalled his attention to will by strict observance,facilitate his labors greatly in future. Bro.Waldram is what may be called a teacher ofthe old school, whose methods of teaching willscarcely harmonize for a great length of timewith the rest of the Faculty of this Academy. ThePrimary Grade was conducted by one of Bro.Moench's Normals in a mattnner highly credi-table for this young beginner, especially as heconducts his classes only temperarily during theabsence of Bro. Cutler, who has since returnedto Ogden. I addressed in the evening a largeaudience under the auspices of the PolysophicalSociety of the Weber Stake Academy, and startedFriday, March 29, in the morning with thetrain for Farmington, where I had been re-quested to attend the monthly Priesthoodmee-ting of that Stake on the establishment of aStake Academy. President Smith presiding.By request I laid the aims and workings of ourChurchschoolorganizative before the bretheren.The importance of ladyteachers, and the cultiva-tion of Singing was [duelled] upon also at somelength.

I discover thatmy personal visits to all those institutions will be necesary in order to get everything graduallyinto shape.

I calledthe attention of these bretheren to the very elaborateoutside of the building; the great cost of whichcould only be met with under our present circumstances at the expense and to the lossof far more important and useful items inside,as for instance apparatus, library, utensils,cabinets, and laberatories [etc.] After the Priesthoodmeeting, the Stake Board of Education met,and we discussed and rectified a planfor the Stake Academy. That same morningreturned to Salt Lake City, and thus closethis circuitvisitThere are several pionts of a general nature thathave been brought out during this circuitvisitin my conversations with members of Stake boardsand Faculties.1. That only teachers be employed by StakeBoards that hold a Certificate in this for a Pri-mary, Intermediate, or Academic Teacher, issuedby the General Examining Board.2. The difference in the grades of a among ourChurch Academies is so wide, that ^a^ well definedgrade should be established for each, until changedby order of the General Board.3. Lady Normals should generally be trainedfor Primary, Ladies Work, and Music.4. This past circuitvisit in crowding aboutfour weeks mark into one, have demonstratedthe necessity of not only more frequent and

 Provo, November 24. [18]88.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Since my last letter of the 3rd inst. to you the work in our church-school-organization has been going on at an increasing ratio, andconsider it my duty to make a short summary report to you asfar as I have been able to obtain information. As until the timesof the issuing of Circular No. 2, my intercourse with the variousAcademies was confined to [illegible] occasions when I was either instruc-ted by you to write to certain parties, or my assistance was so-licited by Stake Authorities or Teachers themselves, a systemat-ic operation of all our existing schools, tending to a harmo-nious blending of all our labors to a common end, couldnot very well be attempted, without the appearance of of-ficiousness on my part, which very suspicion would domore harm than any possible good could have beengained by premature overanxiety. But your Circular,putting affairs at once into proper shape, enjoins simplyupon me the duty to inform myself to some extent inregard to the spirit, condition, and results of every church-school, and to labor with the end in view, that every schoolof our organization feels itself as a constituent part of a 
 Provo City, June 29, 89President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Referring to a passage in my letter of the 24th inst. to theSecretary Bro. Geo. Reynolds in regard to Bro. Joshua Green-wood whom I had suggested as Principal of the Box ElderStake Academy, versa Bro. J. J. Anderson resigned, I beg leaveto make following additional reports: Bro. Greenwood,being a man with a family, and naturally anxious aboutany disposition to be made of him in the church school ser-vice, wrote to me about some decision. I did quiet himuntil I should receive an ^answer^ from President Clawson ofBrigham City to my letter of inquiry. Thatis answer ar-rived this morning but leaves me in the dark as muchas ever, at least as far this Academy is concerned.  Bro. R. Clawson states in the first place, that they shouldlike to know to what extent the General Board will assistthem, and then, what amount Bro. Greenwood desires assalary. In the second place he says, if the General Boardwould pay the Principal's salary, the Stake Board couldmeet the other obligations such as providing for assis-tant teachers, running expenses viz. viz.; otherwise they

I submit, herewith a few points, intended to becommunicated to the various Principals for report, so thatI can make a summary report to you previous to nextApril Conference.Suggestive Points to the Academy Principals.1. Give full name, Priesthood, Graduating, and Curriculum,Age, and Salary of every teacher, whether regular or Specialist.2. When was your Academy organized?3. Give names of successive Principals, and ^names of^ teachers undereach.4. Which department does your Academy consist of?5. Make a general report about the condition of yourpromises, furniture, and utensils.6. What is the condition or prospect of your Laberatory,Cabinet, Library, and Scientific apparatus?7. Do you hold regular faculty meetings withMinutes on record? 
 2. continuedcould not see their way through. Thirdly, that theyhad paid Bro. Anderson $60000; 1/2 Cash; 1/4 Mdse; 1/4 Tithingwhich arrangement had been of considerable benefit tothe Academy. As points 2 and 3 hinge on the outcome ofpoint 1, no definite idea presents itself to my mind uponwhich I could formulate a proposition to Bro. Green-wood, who wants to make his arrangements before the opening of the school year.There is a great deal of crowding upon me justnow going on by many of the teachers that have not yet been disposed of, "to know what their dispositionis to be, as the district schools are after them withenticing propositions. I wish these Stake Boardswould hurry up their reports, in regard to their wantsof Principals and Teachers, that I could dispose of them.I am afraid, that when all available teachers havesecured positions for themselves, we in the church-school-service have to take what is left, instead ofhaving the first choice.With constant prayers for your welfare I remainYour brother in the Gospel. Karl G. Maeser 
 continued.8. Do you keep your Register of Studies, Term Record,and Annual Record?9. Please to furnish me a copy of your Plan andyour Daily Programme.10. What dates are your Public Examinations?Please to instruct me in regard to these or other pointsof a similar nature you should desire to have attendedto.As the B.Y. Academy has now reached the number of326 registered students and still more coming, and inaddition to this, Bro. N. L. Nelsen, one of my principalteachers has been prevented from being at his post on ac-count of dyphtheria in his family with no prospect ofspeedy recovery, my labors have multiplied greatly uponme, and prevent me, therefore, from visiting occasional-ly one or the other of those Academies just now, al-though quite a number of them are constantly askingme to come.Bro.

 Provo, November 29 88President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,According to your instructions, received this morning per letterfrom Bro. Reynolds, I have written to President Crosby at Pan-guitch, that Bro. Allen R. Cutler had arrived here from hismission last Monday, and occupied himself with takingnotes and getting posted in regard to organizing and conduc-ting that new Academy, ^and that^ he will start at once south, andtelegraph from Milford when he expects to reach Panguitch,when it would be desirable to meet at once with the StakeBoard of Education for the purpose of arranging matters.I explained to Bro. Crosby the unavoidable cause of delaywhich has caused them so much disappointment.Bro. Olaf Larsen has started for Woodruff to takecharge of their churchschool, and Bro. A. N.

Academy.They are in an overcrowded condition, had to dismissthe Preparatory Department in order to make room forthe larger students, and almost a hundred applicantshad to be refused admission. This case demands seriousconsideration, and I should suggest, that the Bishopsof Salt Lake City take this matter in hand, andorganize at least four Preparatory Churchschoolsin appropriate parts of the city, under our super-vision.A letter of the 22nd inst. from Bro. Ch. A. Walch, Morgan Cityinforms me, that they have organized there also a Stake Boardof Education, himself Secretary, and want a teacher tocommence school on the first Monday in December.
