Brother Taylor said he did not see  it in that light He worshiped a personage and not the Atributes he thought God was Located and could not worship the Atributes in any body. President Young then called a vote of the assembly and said if you understand this to be a correct doctrin as here written I wish you manifest President Young then said do I worship Atributes or the dispenser of those Atributes I worship the Disspencer of those of those atributes, and Not the Atributes. This is O Pratts sermon prepared for the Press I do not want to have it published if it is not right. Brother Orson worships the Atributes of God but not God I worship not the Atributes but that God who holds and  dispenses if Eternity was full of atributes and No one to dispens them they would not be worth a feather. Suppose an Angel to us to Night with a message From God and he tels the angels not to make himself known He comes to us with a message   ENDENTRY  and gives a New Law and a penalty for not obeying you may ask who are you he may not tell you who he is or he may say God sent me, you may say whare is that God who sent you I dont know or care any thing about you or what you say. He might say to you I am a god to you. Moses said to Israel I am a God to you. Joseph said to us I am a God to you, this was true and upon the same principles I am  a God to this people &amp; so is any man who is appointed to lead Israel or the Kingdom of God if the people reject him they reject the one who sent him but we will let that drop, and turn to the other subjet now  suppose we were all to receive a fullness of the Atributes of God and According to Orson Pratts Theory The Lord had a fulness and  He could not advance but we could advance till we were Equal to him then if we worshiped the Atributes instead of God we would soon worship ourselves as soon as we had a fulness of those atributes then you cannot worship any thing beyound yourself you would then worship the atributes &amp; not the dispenser of those atributes "this is fals doctrin" God did not say worship Moses because he was a God to the people, you may say to your wife or son do so &amp; so, they will say I will not but I  will go to a greater man I will go to Brigham Young, you might say I am your counciller Dictator or your God Either would be correct and they should obey your Just &amp; righteous command yet they should ^not^ worship you for this would be sin. Orson Pratt has differed from me in many things, But this is a great principle &amp; I do not wish to say you shall do so and so I do not know of a man who has a mathamat- ical turn of mind but what goes to Far. The trouble between Orson  Pratt &amp; me is I do not know Enough &amp; he knows to much. I do not know evry thing their is a mystery concerning the God I worship  which mystery will be removed when I come to a full knowledge of God. One of the greatest things Joseph Smith ever did was to Familiarize Heaven &amp; Earth and cause them to shake hand together and become Familiar together this was a great principle it is sim- ple yet true. When I meet the  with whom I have been acquainted, upon the same principle that I would to meet with my Earthly Father after going upon a  Journey &amp; returning home.    it is our privelege so to live as to have the spirit of God to bear record of the Truth of any revelation that comes from God through   ENDENTRY  the mouth of his Prophet who leads his people and it has ever been a key with me that when The Prophet who leads presents a doctrin or principle or says thus saith the Lord I make it a point to receive or views being well satisfied that the Lord would reveal the truth unto his Prophet whom he has called to lead his Church before he would unto me, and the word of the Lord through the prophet is the End of the Law unto me. Joseph Young both backed me up. Joseph Young said "I do not believe in the doctrin of  worshiping the attributes and not the Auther I once loved a woman she says to me you shall have my respect &amp; kind regards &amp; she told me to go in peace I told her it was not her good  will that I wanted alone I wanted her. So with my God if  he was to say to me Joseph here take my attributes &amp; go I would say No Father it is not your attributes alone that I want but I want you. When I read O Pratts views in the  seer I could not swallow it. Joseph the Prophet said when you see your Father you will see him Just as he was in this life ownly he will be full of Strength Glory Immortality &amp; Eternal  life President Brigham Young said now here is the Twelve I wish to extend there Influence as Far as I can but I cannot do it while  in England (as I understand the people are clear down) is what Orson Pratt Preached in the seer. There is not a man in the  Church that can preach better than Orson Pratt upon any subject which he understands it is music to hear him but the trouble is he will preach upon things he does not know any thing about and t Elder Hyde, He preaches upon the resurrection &amp; teaches things which are not true. I will tell you the God which you and I worship, it is a Being that was on an Earth like this He has been cloathed in Mortality the same as  we have been and he has had Devils to fight the same as we have had but I do not expect they were the same Devils that we have. That God says I am your God and there is none Els let us worship him and none Els. He is the God that we have.

Presented a Memorial to the assembly which was read  and adopted but returned to the Committee to Finish &amp;  prepare it By ingrossing. President Young addressed the  assembly He said I suppose the people will expect a political speech from me but I shall not say much but this much I  will say, we should guide the people by acts &amp; not by words. I have  been the Govornor of this Territory some Eight years and  every thing has been done that was necessary and all has been  done right all our documents have been got vary corr- ectly I have had good Clerks around me. We now  are about to step into a State Government. we shall not take  any illegal steps, we are doing Nothing Except what the Constitution of the United States garuntee unto us, but we have not felt before to take this step untill now, we  now feel to do it it is our duty and we think we can  maintain a Government. We do not wish to refer to the past but prepare for the future if the United States will  admit us well if not better it will be all right. we will  not break down the door in order to get in.

If you hear any man say that we are not doing right in  Holding a convention &amp; forming a state Government tell them it  is not so, we are doing mothing but what is strictly Constitutio- nal. We shall be the ownly people that will maintain the Const- itution while others will break it. We will ask Congress to  admit us into the family of states what if they do not? We have  got a Government and what are they going to do about it  If the Constitution has been carried out it would have  President Buchannan and all who were associated with him in making war upon us. Some want to stay longer to talk but I am willing the United States should know that we are capable of doing up important business in a short time mu faster than any other people. I like this Constitution. But what Business has such a sentence in the Constitution that all  men may  about God it would be much more applicable if it said  that all men might make a God of Gold, silver, Brass Iron  wood or stone or of any thing Els and worship that.

What is done  here is done by the unanimous voice of all the people. Not a voice is lifted against it this is an Evidence that it is right.

Mr Baptiste was at the grave yard at the time the poliece went up to him and he was picking up cobble stones &amp; took him up to the grave of Clawson  and accused him of Robing the dead body He denyed it but after being choaked a while He confessed it and then confessed that   and all of the clothing of the dead found in his possession was taken to the Court House and there Exhibited so that any persons who had buried friends since He had been diging graves might se if they could recognize the grave clothes Mrs Woodruff &amp; myself went down to se if we could recognize the grave cloths of Father Woodruff but we could recognize Nothing as the Aprons were all destroyed and the robes taken to peaces. There lay the grave cloths of fifty persons or more some twenty pair of little  childrens stockings and the clothing of all ages male &amp; female which that man had striped from the dead Bodies of Saints &amp; sinners. He done his work mostly  nights He had a house nearest to the grave yard so that no person had detected him in his diabolical work.

I think it more profitable for the saints to  meet together to hear lectures delivered upon the arts &amp; scien- ces and various principles than to spend so much time in  danceing and light amusement. The subject which I wish  to speak upon this Evening is Journaliz subject Embraces a wide Field far greater than I shall  attempt to Explore this Evening. History is given under two general Heads viz Sacred and profane and as spiritual  and temporal things are inseparably connected, so is sacred  &amp; profane History many times is vary closely connected together. We have but vary little History in the Early ages  of the world Either Sacred or Profane, and but vary few His- torians or Journalists in any age of the world when   ENDENTRY  compared with other callings &amp; avocations of life. I shall not say much upon profane History during this Evening I will However refer to one or two prominent Historians. Rollins compiled an Elaberate History of the ancient Medes, Persians  Asyrians, Babylonians, &amp; Caldeans. He gives a History of their  government customs Literature &amp; Laws but more Esspecially  of their wars. I would recommend this History for our  yound young men to read who wish to become acquainted with an- cient History. I would also recommend the reading of Josepheus  the great Jewish Historian it appears to me that no man can  read with indiference His account of the siege of Jerrusalem by the Roman Army the destruction of their city &amp; Temple their captivity &amp; dispersion among the Gentiles Nations. Here in the  siege of Jerrusalem over one million of Jews perished  famine, pestilence, &amp; fire. I would also refer to the History of Greece  &amp; Rome &amp; Modern Europe &amp; America or the History of any  Nation and ask how have we obtained the History of those Nations, Kingdom &amp; Countrys. you may say that Historians  have handed those things down unto us, But How have Historians  obtained materials from which to compile the I answer From the scribes, reporters, &amp; Journalists who wrote  day by day Events as they passed before there Eyes and this  class of men forms the foundation of all History and from  there Material, Historians who live hundreds of years after Events transpire will compile History. But without material Historians cannot make History or any thing Else.    cal History. Moses wrote the first five Books viz  ##Leviticus##, ##Numbers##, &amp; ##Deuteronomy|D History of the Early ages of man. We have a revelation in the  ##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53-54|doctrins &amp; covenants## page 79 which says that "three years before  the death of Mahalaleel, Methuselah all who were High Priests with the residue of his posterity who were righteous into the valley of Adam Ondi Ahman and there bestowed upon them his  last Blessing and the Lord appeared unto them and they rose   ENDENTRY  "Up &amp; blessed Michael the Prince the  Archangel and the Lord administered comfort unto Adam and said unto him I have set thee to be at the Head a multitude of Nations shall come of thee and thou art a prince over them  forever."

But there records were kept upon parchment &amp; papyrus written in Chalde many Hieroglyphics in order to convey their ideas &amp;  principles to future generations, some of which have  been translated into the English language by the order  of King James which now forms the Bible. But what  a small History the Bible is of the dealings of God for  4000 years with the Nations of the Earth.    &amp; Kingdom of God upon the Earth. He organized the Church, chose  Twelve Apostles also Seventies &amp; set the Church in order with  all the gifts graces and blessings. He administered the ordinances of the gospel, wrought many miracles and finished the work He was sent to do. But Jesus Christ with all the saints had to contend  with the world the flesh and the devel &amp; Jew &amp; Gentile and  the world overcome them and put them to death and the Church   ENDENTRY  of Christ disappeared with that generation. What is the History of that generation? it is vary short. The four Evangelist  John, gives the History Biirth life and  death of the  the Journals &amp; done most of the writing He recorded the Acts  of the Apostles. Then Paul wrote his Epistles to the various  churches. Then Peter  wrote two short Epistles about as much as one of our  reporters would write in one short discourse. Then Jude  wrote one short chapter. Then John the Revelator when he was Banished to the Isle of Patmos under the reign  of Domician Cezar wrote his Revelations ##Revelation 1:9## after He was  recalled under the reign of Nerv Epistles. this maks 8 writers in the New Testament and there testimony was vary limited, also their writings  as far as they have come to us, at least when we take into consideration the great work which they performed    tinent were commanded of God to write their history upon  Gold Plates which were hid up in the Earth to come forth  in our day to be translated by the Prophet Joseph through the power of God for the benefit of the Saints. This forms the Book of Mormon  and is the purest translation of ancient records that we have any knowledge of upon Earth yet this record gives but  a limited Idea of the dealings of God with that People yet what we have obtained was by strict commandment of God.    need not tell you that this is the kingdom of God, Esstablished by God Himself which is to take the place of all other kingdoms  upon Earth and we are the People Ordained of God to Esstab- lish his kingdom upon the Earth, build up Zion and prepare the way for the coming of Je not keep a Journal, Record, &amp; History of the dealings  of God with us as they transpire day by day before our Eyes?  we should. This Church &amp; Kingdom is organized in all  the fulness of the Holy Priesthood necessary for the   ENDENTRY  accomplishment of the work of God in this great  and fulness of times the  Church of Christ has been Esstablished in our day with Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, High Priests  Deacons, Gifts, graces Revelations and with all the ordinances Necessary for  the salvation of the children of ^men^. Joseph Smith was the  the first Apostle, Prophet, Seer, &amp; Revelator called in  these Book of Mormon  and organized the Church of Christ as he was com- manded by the Revelations of Jesus Christ. When the Twelve Apostles were chosen &amp; ordained The  Prophet Joseph gave them strict instruction to keep a record of there procedings (see the History of the Church Feb 1835)  The following Extract) "Since the Twelve are now appointed  &amp; chosen I wish to tell them a course which they may  pursue and be benefitted in one point of light of which perhaps they are not now aware. At all times when you assemble in the capacity of a council to transact  business let the oldest preside and let one or more be appo- inted to keep a record of your proceedings, and on the decision of Every important  let such de remain upon record as LAW, Covenant, &amp; doctrin.    but should they be recorded and one of you lay hands upon  them afterwards you might finds them of infinate worth not ownly to your Brethren but a feast to your own souls"     Joseph always recommended the priesthood to keep a rec- ord of all their Official acts, and among his last letters to  the Church before he was slain he urges upon the Church  to be particular in there records of the Bapti the dead to be vary particular in there records of there  official acts, that what they bound on Earth should be bound in heaven and what they loosed on Earth should be loosed   ENDENTRY  in heaven. and what you record on Earth shall be recorded in Heaven. President Brigham Young has also carried out the  same Principle since He has been president of the Church, in all  of our ordinances, Endowments, sealings and official acts He wishes us to be particular in recording the same. This Church is organized with a presidency of 3 men the Twelve Apostles also 63 Quorums of Seventies  of Deacons. all  should keep a Journal of the dealings of God with them and there officials acts, and keep a true History of Events in this  great dispensation. I was inspired &amp; moved upon to write a Journal &amp; keep a record of the affairs of this Church from the time I first Joined this Church up to the Pres Ever heard the Prophet Joseph, or Brigham Young or the Apostles teach preach or Prophesy or perform any official act but what I have recorded it i persons were recording the same, and I could not feel Easy untill I had accomplished it. I have written more sacred History of the teaching of the prophets &amp; Apostles &amp; official acts of the Latter day Sants than would make several  as large as the one Handed down to us by the Ancient  I have kept a Journal of almost Evry day of my life since  I have been a member of this Church. By refering to my Journals  I could tell Each day what I have done, the company I have been  in, and what was transpiring around me, and any council and  Teaching From the Presidency or Twelve Except whare I know  there were reporters recording the same. I have urged this same  course upon the Twelve &amp; the other Quorums of the Church to keep  a record of there meetings &amp; the dealings of God with them and  for all men who bear the Holy Pristhood to keep a record of  their lives or Esspecially of there official Acts, in the Church and kingdom of God. Some may say this is a great deal of trouble But we should not call any thing trouble which brings  to pass good. I consider that portion of my life which has been  spent in keeping Journals &amp; writing History to have been vary  profitably spent. For instance the Lord gives unto us the Holy   ENDENTRY  Priestood and we are sent on a mission to the Nations of the Earth, we go &amp; Preach the gospel &amp; bring many into the church  and the Power of the Holy Ghost rest upon us. We heal the sick, cast out devils, command the Elements &amp; they obey us &amp; the Lord gives unto us dreams visions &amp; Revelations and many Blessings should we not have respect Enough to  out upon us and Our official acts which we do in his name upon the face of the Earth? I think we should.    the Ten Tribes of Israel will return from the North Country unto Zion in the last days suppose that those Israelites should come to Zion in our day Led by the Holy Prophets of God what would be one of the first questions we would ask  them? it would be, whare are your records? show is us  your History we want to read an account of the dealings of the Lord with you since you were led away under Asyria ##2 Kings 18:9-11## But what would be our disappointment if they should ^say^ O we have not  kept any record or account of the great &amp; mighty works of God among our tribes for many generations, we  have herd our Fathers say that the great &amp; marvelous works in there day we have also had  great Blessings while on our Journey to Zion from the North Country. The mountains o Ice flowed down before us and  there was a Highway cast up for us to walke in as there was to Israel when they came out of Cainan ##Joshua 3:16-17## and the Nations Trembled at our presence but we did not keep a record of these things we did not think any body would be particularly interested in it but ourselves. should we not be greatly disappointed at such information? we should &amp; so would it be with them when they come to Zion &amp; Enquire for the History of this church &amp; kingdom if we were to tell them that we had not kept any History of the rise &amp; progress of the Church. But instead of neglecting this branch of our work let Evry man who can keep a Journal &amp; record   ENDENTRY  Events as they pass before our Eyes day by day, this will make a valua- ble legacy to our children  ations by giving them a true History of the rise &amp; progress of  the Church &amp; Kingdom of God upon the Earth in this last dispen- sation instead of leaving it to our Enemies to write a fals History of the true Church of Christ. Brethren and sisters we are making History Every day let that History be good let us do the works of righteousness that when our acts are recorded we shall be satisfied with them Either in time or Eternity I ask these Blessings in the Name of Jesus Christ Amen    translation from the bible he made some remarks upon his Early days    ENDENTRY February 13, 1862       ENDENTRY February 14, 1862    at the 70' Hall.
