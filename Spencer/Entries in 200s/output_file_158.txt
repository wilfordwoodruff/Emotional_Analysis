 [OF]FICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day SaintsP.O. Box, B.Salt Lake City, Utah. Oct. 14, 1893.Prest. W. T. Stewart,New Zealand.Dear Brother:Your favor of Aug. 12th reached our office while we wereabsent at the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, or it would havebeen answered by the last mail.With regard to the matter the emigration of some of theMaori Saints that occupies the most prominent place in your communicationwe will say that, as you are aware, we have hitherto felt reluctant toencourage the wemigration of any of this people from their native islandsto Zion; our experience with our Kanaka brethren and sisters not havingbeen altogether encouraging; but after perusing your letter and learn-ing therefrom their characteristics, their industry and capability forsuch work as is incidental to the opening of a new country we have feltthat a limited number of the best and most capable brethren and theirfamilies might at the present be permitted to gather, such ones as youand your associate missionaries would deem most suitable to meet andovercome the difficulties and peculiarities of so great a change in theirmode of life as would be incidental to their removal to the^se^ mountains.Neither do we think it would be well to treat them as our emigrants ofthe white races are treated permit them when they reach here to make away for themselves, locate where they choose and provide for theirnecessities as seems best to their judgment. We believe that it will bedesirable to have our Maori friends placed in the charge of some one ormore of the brethren who know their language and who have love and 
 sympathy for them as a people; and further that they be advised to settlein some district or region of our country where the climate is as suitableto them as can be found, and the natural productions consistent with themodes of life that will be most advantageous to them. In considering thismatter, we have come to the conclusion that Kanab and its neighborhoodwill be as suitable for settlement by the limited number that you suggest,as any other portion of the inter-mountain region with which we areacquainted.Such of the intending emigrants as can do so, of thosewhom you decide are proper persons to come, should accompany you onyour return hiome, so that they can have the benefit of your counsel andguidance on the way. Further, we should be pleased to have you continueyour supervision over them when they reach their future home, that theystill may have a father to look to for the instruction, guidance andsupport that they will undoubtedly need. But of the details of this,and who shall be called to assist you, when such are needed, we can morefully arrange when we meet you.It is probable that all the missionaries for whom youhave asked for New Zealand, Australia and Tasmania will not leave by theNovember boat. The stringency of the times is such that a number of thebrethren who have been called on foreign missions have not been able toraise their passage money by the time appointed and their departure hashad to be postponed. So, we have reason to believe, will be the casewith some of those called to labor under your presidency.We will now say, Brother Stewart, that you are honorablyreleased, with our approval and blessing on your labors, from thePresidency of the Australasian Mission, with the privilege of returninghome whenever you consider the best interests of the mission will per-mit. You will please transfer to Elder William Gardner, who has beenchosen to succeed you, all the books, papers and property of the mission, 
 and aid him in assuming his new duties by affording him all the informa-tion with regard to the churches and their members that lies in your power.It has been the custom to require half yearly StatisticalReports from the various Stakes of Zion and from the Foreign Missions,but at our last General Conference, it was decided that in future anAnnual Report made up to December 31st of each year would better answerthe purpose. In the past the reports have, in many cases, been incompletecovering various periods of time, and ending at almost every day of thecalander year. This irregularity has robbed these reports of allreliability regarding the facts which they are intended to represent andmade them misleading rather than trustworthy. It is hoped that thischange will not only secure uniformity but completeness also, if aneffort is made by the Secretaries and others, whose dutiy it is to attendto these things, to have them as perfect as possible. You will thereforemake your next Statistical report include the period from the date ofyour last report to the end of this year, and annually thereafter.The brethren chosen for Tasmania are Elders F. W. Ellis(North Ogden) and Lysander C. Pond (Pocatello). Elder Ellis is a man offine ability, lengthy experience and a good singer. He is about 40years of age. Elder Pond is a younger man, also well recommended. Hehas written for permission to have his wife accompany him, stating thatshe was a young woman admirably adapted for missionary work. We wroteback that Tasmania would be a hard missionary field for a sister, but ifhe still desired it, we would not object. At this writing, we have notlearned which way he has decided. Two of the other brethren will beinstructed to secure tickets for Sidney, and on their arrival you canchange the field of labor of any or all of them as you, from yourknowledge of the needs of the mission, may deem best. 
 With love to yourself, your fellow missionaries, and allthe Saints,We remain, Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F. Smith

 Mar 8th [189]8Pres Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City UtahDear BrotherWe quote the following extract from a letter from Bp. Wm. B. Preston to us under date of Mar 1st"We beg to inform you that in the future we can not allow the Tithing Department to be charged with the expense of buggy for Pres. Ricks, as also the feed and care of horses for him.  These items must be eliminated from the amount of 1898 unless permission is given in writing by the First Presidency"A word of explanation as to what we have beendoing in this particular might not be out of placeWe have on hand a large two [axled] buggy that was furnished for our use a few years ago under the direction of Bp Preston.  We also have a buggy harness here belonging to the Tithing DepartmentBro Ricks has furnished his own team gratuitously,but the expenses of feed, repairs, horshoeing etc have been charged to the general expense account of our 
 Stake office. We estimate that between Fifty and Fifty Five Dollars on Hay and Grass has been fedthe team and about Twentyfive or Thirty Dollars in repairs sharing etc per annum has been expendedin keeping the outfit in a reasonable condition for service.  Our reasons for so doing are that our stake is so large that we felt that we could not do justice to our duties in our official capacity unless some convenience of this nature was provided.While we have your attention we beg to state thatunder existing instructions we feel somewhat delicate in drawing anything on our customary appropriationuntil receiving your order to do so. Should it meet your approval an order for the amount usually allowed Pres Ricks and Rigby would be appreciated Brother Bassett feels in a condition to get along without any for the present at least.I shall be pleased to know your minds on both matters mentioned above whenever convenient for you to favor us with their consideration.

If the arrangements are as he states we have a misunderstanding of the caseOur impressions were that no one of our missionaries to Montana were to be called for only three months with the exception of those who had previously had an experience in the missionary field.When Bro Jone Henry Smith was here at our late Stake Conference Bro Drigg's name was suggested for a mission to Montana but on account of his business interests he was allowed a certain length of time to make the necessary preparations.We are not posted as to whether any other arrangements have been made by Bro John Henry or yourself, and would be pleased to know 
 as to whether such is or is not the case so as to be able to explain your wishes to Bro Driggsand give him the necessary information as to his Railroad permit, License, setting apart etcupon his arrival here on Monday next also as to whether his call is for three months only.With best wishes we remainYour Brother T E RicksT.

 Mar 15th [189]8Pres Wilford Woodruff and CounselorsSalt L. City UtahDear Brethren:I am in receipt of a communication from Elder Geo Reynolds under date of Mar 14th stating that you would be pleased to learn from me what were my legal and other reasons that caused me to look with disfavor on the effort to remove the County Seat from StAnthony to Rexburg.My legal reason is in Sec 2 Art 18 of our State Constitution which reads as follows.Sec 2 3 county seat shall be removed unless upon petition of a majority of the qualified elctors of the county and unless two thirds of the qualified electors of the county vote [for] the proposition at a general election shall vote in favor of such removal. A[word faded] petition of removal of the county seatshall not be submitted in the same county more than once in one year, except as provided 
 by existing laws.The election that made St Anthony the Permanent County seat was held in the fall of 1894. With some, I admit it is held that the six year provision does not apply to the first removal of a permanent county seat and that it only refers to a proposition of removalafter a similar attempt has been previously made Others hold that it would apply with equal propriety in a first attempt of removal. As to just how the courts would interpret this is a question that the future only could decide and to combat the opposition that would undoubtedly be made on this technicality in case of our obtaining the necessary votes would unquestionably entail considerable expenses and of course with our favorable chances of losing even then.A careful canvass of the votes by precinct at our last election indicated very strongly to me that it was an absolute impossibility to acquire the necessary votes for its removal atthe coming election and that an almost super human 
 effort would have t[o] be made to come anywhere near that number involving an outlay of thousands of dollars, much valuable time and a serious division in the good feelings and unity of our people that would inevitably result from a contest of this nature.With the growing sentiments in favor of Rexburg by reason of our religious and educational interest and the standing morality of our people and the waning sentiment in favor of St Anthony caused by the encouragements to crimes of various ^kinds^given there and other causes, I felt that our vote in the future say 2 or 4 years hence would be stronger and that should ^we^ be successful in then obtaining the necessary 2/3 vote all legal questions that now embarras us would be removedwithout the expense and annoyance of having to fight them in the courts.While at Salt Lake City a few weeks ago [text faded] see you personally on this matter I left [text faded] us not only of 6 of the committee of [text faded] but had been selected to investigate and 
 determine whether or not a contest should be made but by others of our leading business and influential men in the hands of Brother Geo. F. Gibbs, all of whom sustained me in the cource I took and to which I beg to refer you for further information on this subjectIf however these are not sufficiently explanatory I shall be pleased to answer any questions you may desire to ask at any time.I beg to assure you that my advice on this matter was only taken after a careful consideration of all sides of the question having in view the best good of our people as a whole and with no desire to harm even the ^an^ hair of the headof any man.Hoping that at your convenience you will favor me with your opinion as to whether my cource in the premecis did or did meet with your approval I remainYours very truly.

 610 Mar 24  8Pres. W. Woodruff and CounselorsSalt L. City Utah Dear Brethren:Your favor of the 22nd inst to hand in which you ask two further question relative to the stand I took on the county seat proposition, the first is:  When I originally endorsed the movement was I not acquainted with the arguments I now use, and if I was, who did I at first countenance the effort.Replying to this I beg to say that I do not wish to be understood as originally endorsing the move, but after considerable agitation by[ illegible] our citizens I did consent and took part in appointing a council to simply investigate what could be done and whether as it ^was^ contended by some to say as a absolutely [clear] legally, and to report their findings before any definite action should be taken, but that I at first countenanced the action of [illegible] I most explicitly deny.After this committe has made their report I can [illegible] the approval by 
 technicalities [illegible] though we might perchance surmount[ illegible] an expense that I felt [illegible] would ^be^ [illegible] to incur.  I had also by this time made a [illegible ] of the [illegible ] we might reasonably expect in our favor, which demonstrated to me it was better to drop the matter for the present as[illegible]Your second question was, why I declined to give those interested the reasons for any change of base.I [illegible] to say as before that stated, that I had not changed my base, but that I invited some of the members of this community to meet me at my office at a given time, that I might give them my [illegible ] in this matter, they however invited othersnot of our faith and who had previously proven [illegible ] to our people to offend and while those [illegible] were all presentI did not feel at liberty to speak as freely on the subject as I otherwise would have done.  I was there and then in my own office indirectly accused of being bribed by one of our own brethren in the presence of a roomfull of those interested, 
 left the office before I had an opportunity of speaking to him as freely as I otherwise would have been pleased to do.  These brethren are the facts in the case as far as I am able to tell them at present.  If however there is anything further that you wish to ask I shall be pleased to answer them as far as I am able.  Awaiting your further pleasure I remainYour [illegible]T. E. Ricks
