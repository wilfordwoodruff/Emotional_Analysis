President Young showed us on the map whare the Apostles Preached the country through which they travelled and  probably it continued to the Archipeligo and that the Malays had the gospel and that the Israelitish traditions were among  them. President Young said that all the world would have  been warned long ago in our day if all the world had been as faith- ful in warning his Neighbor as He and many of the Elders of this  Church. When going to Zion in 1834 Joseph reproved the camp while standing upon a waggon wheel I said I had done the best  I could and could not Better it if I was to try it again H. C. Kimball  said the same. They said they had been in the Church nearly  half of his life. (I WW have been in the Church more than half  of my life) I remarked that it was an interesting time to live to to see the fulfillment of the President Young said it was an interesting  time. H C Kimball said we should see it Just as well if Dead as if alive. President Young said, while we are in the flesh, we have  to contend against evil spirits and Devils in a way which will  be hid from us in the Spirit World. Brother Kimball said in  speaking of our Prayer circle I never saw T. D. Brown in that circle but what I felt sorry to see him there. President Young said He would never have been there If you had not Recommended  him for I had not confidence enough in him He leacked lacked and so  did Wm. W.

Smith who was sick The Presidency of the Seventies Bishop Hunter and many others A Hymn was sung O Happy Souls who pray Prayer By O Hyde President Young stated the object of the meeting was to convers upon Doctrinal Points to see if we see alike and think alike I Pray that we may have the spirit of God to rest upon us that our minds  may be upon the subject and that we may speak by the Holy spirit He then called upon A Carrington to read a sermon he read it before the company a peace prepared for the press written by Orson Pratt upon the Godhead He claimed that it was the  atributes of God that He worshiped and not the person and  that He worshiped those Atributes whether He found them in  God, Jesus Christ Adam, Moses, The Apostles Joseph, Brigham  or in any body Els after the document was read President Young then called upon the Twelve to express their feelings upon the subject He called upon O Hyde to speak and he called upon TJ Taylor to speak He spoke a short time No one knew at the time (except the President and Carrington) who was the author of the document read. Brother Taylor said he did not see  it in that light He worshiped a personage and not the Atributes he thought God was Located and could not worship the Atributes in any body. President Young then called a vote of the assembly and said if you understand this to be a correct doctrin as here written I wish you manifested it by saying yes No one spoke President Young then said do I worship Atributes or the dispenser of those Atributes I worship the Disspencer of those of those atributes, and Not the Atributes. This is O Pratts sermon prepared for the Press I do not want to have it published if it is not right. Brother Orson worships the Atributes of God but not God I worship not the Atributes but that God who holds and  dispenses if Eternity was full of atributes and No one to dispens them they would not be worth a feather. Suppose an Angels comes to us to Night with a message From God and he tels the angels not to make himself known He comes to us with a message   ENDENTRY 27th 1860 and gives a New Law and a penalty for not obeying you may ask who are you he may not tell you who he is or he may say God sent me, you may say whare is that God who sent you I dont know or care any thing about you or what you say. He might say to you I am a god to you. Moses said to Israel I am a God to you. Joseph said to us I am a God to you, this was true and upon the same principles I am  a God to this people and so is any man who is appointed to lead Israel or the Kingdom of God if the people reject him they reject the one who sent him but we will let that drop, and turn to the other subjet now  suppose we were all to receive a fullness of the Atributes of God and According to Orson Pratts Theory The Lord had a fulness and we could He could not advance but we could advance till we were Equal to him then if we worshiped the Atributes instead of God we would soon worship ourselves as soon as we had a fulness of those atributes then you cannot worship any thing beyound yourself you would then worship the atributes and not the dispenser of those atributes "this is fals doctrin" God did not say worship Moses because he was a God to the people, you may say to your wife or son do so and so, they will say I will not but I  will go to a greater man I will go to Brigham Young, you might say I am your counciller Dictator or your God Either would be correct and they should obey your Just and righteous command yet they should ^not^ worship you for this would be sin. Orson Pratt has differed from me in many things, But this is a great principle and I do not wish to say you shall do so and so I do not know of a man who has a mathamat- ical turn of mind but what goes to Far. The trouble between Orson  Pratt and me is I do not know Enough and he knows to much. I do not know evry thing their is a mystery concerning the God I worship  which mystery will be removed when I come to a full knowledge of God. One of the greatest things Joseph Smith ever did was to Familiarize Heaven and Earth and cause them to shake hand together and become Familiar together this was a great principle it is sim- ple yet true. When I meet the gGod I worship I expect to personage with whom I have been acquainted, upon the same principle that I would to meet with my Earthly Father after going upon a  Journey and returning home.   W. Woodruff spoke and said that it is our privelege so to live as to have the spirit of God to bear record of the Truth of any revelation that comes from God through   ENDENTRY 27th 1860 the mouth of his Prophet who leads his people and it has ever been a key with me that when The Prophet who leads presents a doctrin or principle or says thus saith the Lord I make it a point to received it even if it comes in contack with my tradition or views being well satisfied that the Lord would reveal the truth unto his Prophet whom he has called to lead his Church before he would unto me, and the word of the Lord through the prophet is the End of the Law unto me. Joseph Young both backed me up. Joseph Young said "I do not believe in the doctrin of  worshiping the attributes and not the Auther I once loved a woman she says to me you shall have my respect and kind regards and she told me to go in peace I told her it was not her good  will that I wanted alone I wanted her. So with my God if  he was to say to me Joseph here take my attributes and go I would say No Father it is not your attributes alone that I want but I want you. When I read O Pratts views in the  seer I could not swallow it. Joseph the Prophet said when you see your Father you will see him Just as he was in this life ownly he will be full of Strength Glory Immortality and Eternal  life President Brigham Young said now here is the Twelve I wish to extend there Influence as Far as I can but I cannot do it while I ^they^ teach Fals doctrin One of the causes of the declartion in England (as I understand the people are clear down) is what Orson Pratt Preached in the seer. There is not a man in the  Church that can preach better than Orson Pratt upon any subject which he understands it is music to hear him but the trouble is he will preach upon things he does not know any thing about and tehen he will preach fals doctrin and so will Elder Hyde, He preaches upon the resurrection and teaches things which are not true. I will tell you the God which you and I worship, it is a Being that was on an Earth like this He has been cloathed in Mortality the same as  we have been and he has had Devils to fight the same as we have had but I do not expect they were the same Devils that we have. That God says I am your God and there is none Els let us worship him and none Els. He is the God that we have.

James Ferguson Clairman of the Committee on Memorials  Presented a Memorial to the assembly which was read  and adopted but returned to the Committee to Finish and  prepare it By ingrossing. President Young addressed the  assembly He said I suppose the people will expect a political speech from me but I shall not say much but this much I  will say, we should guide the people by acts and not by words. I have  been the Govornor of this Territory some Eight years and  every thing has been done that was necessary and all has been  done right all our documents have been got vary corr- ectly I have had good Clerks around me. We now  are about to step into a State Government. we shall not take  any illegal steps, we are doing Nothing Except what the Constitution of the United States garuntee unto us, but we have not felt before to take this step untill now, we  now feel to do it it is our duty and we think we can  maintain a Government. We do not wish to refer to the past but prepare for the future if the United States will  admit us well if not better it will be all right. we will  not break down the door in order to get in.

I have been the governor all the  time of this people and shall be And I will say to you and to  all men that I will not hold this office or officiate in it ownly  as I shall be dictated by the Holy Priesthood of the Son of God. If you hear any man say that we are not doing right in  Holding a convention and forming a state Government tell them it  is not so, we are doing mothing but what is strictly Constitutio- nal. We shall be the ownly people that will maintain the Const- itution while others will break it. We will ask Congress to  admit us into the family of states what if they do not? We have  got a Government and what are they going to do about it  If the Constitution has been carried out it would have hung President Buchannan and all who were associated with him in making war upon us. Some want to stay longer to talk but I am willing the United States should know that we are capable of doing up important business in a short time mustch faster than any other people. I like this Constitution. But what Business has such a sentence in the Constitution that all  men may worship God as they please? what do the people know about God it would be much more applicable if it said  that all men might make a God of Gold, silver, Brass Iron  wood or stone or of any thing Els and worship that. But  now let us go to and worship God and maintain his kingdom upon the Earth in the name of Jesus Christ Amen   President Heber C.

President D. H. Wells then addressed the assembly. He said  I do not feel as much like talking as I do like acting.  Why will Congress shut the door to us because we were Mormons and they would not do it if this was not the true  Church of Christ. But the days will come when the people  of the United States will seek unto this people for Union for this people will have a permanent Government Joseph Smith told what would come to pass. He spoke of this war  said it would begin at South Carolina but He dare  not publish it at First for fear the people would call it treason. yet it is coming to pass before our Eyes. What is done  here is done by the unanimous voice of all the people. Not a voice is lifted against it this is an Evidence that it is right. President Young asked Judge Kinney if He was  willing to have his speech published Judge Kenney said yes  He was willing.

ENDENTRY January 27, 1862 ~ Monday   27th FIGURES   One of the most Damniable, Diabolical, Satanical, Helish Sacraleges has been committed upon the bodies of the Dead Saints in the burial Ground East of this city and brought to light this day that was ever known or  recorded in the History of man. Clawson who  was shot dead a few days since while resisting the officers of Justice He was buried by the Citiesy authorities some of Clawsons friends obtained permission from  the sextion to take up the bodiesy and remove it to the  Big Cotton Burying ground they took up the coffin containing the body of Moroni Clawson and when they opened the coffin they found the corps Naked which was cloathed when it was buried this led to a careful inquiry and Examination. Jesse C. Little  the Sexton had imployed a Man by the name of John Baptiste to dig the graves and bury the dead from  1859 up to the present time the police immediately   ENDENTRY 1862 went to his house and made a serch and they found many Bundles of graves cloathes about his house in  various parts they also found a large Box filled full of the clothing of the dead from little infants to the aged of both sexes. Mr Baptiste was at the grave yard at the time the poliece went up to him and he was picking up cobble stones and took him up to the grave of Clawson  and accused him of Robing the dead body He denyed it but after being choaked a while He confessed it and then confessed that th he had been robing the dead for Two and a half years they then took him down to prision and all of the clothing of the dead found in his possession was taken to the Court House and there Exhibited so that any persons who had buried friends since He had been diging graves might se if they could recognize the grave clothes Mrs Woodruff and myself went down to se if we could recognize the grave cloths of Father Woodruff but we could recognize Nothing as the Aprons were all destroyed and the robes taken to peaces. There lay the grave cloths of fifty persons or more some twenty pair of little  childrens stockings and the clothing of all ages male and female which that man had striped from the dead Bodies of Saints and sinners. He done his work mostly  nights He had a house nearest to the grave yard so that no person had detected him in his diabolical work. The anoun- cement of it to the public created great consternation through the city. On Being questioned Baptiste acknowledged that  He had been carriying on this Hellish work for three years and a half his ownly motive was to seell the clothing He said the devil was in him which I think was true    ENDENTRY January 28, 1862 ~ Tuesday   28th The Policce took up Baptiste to the grave yard to day to point out the graves which He had opened. But there were many persons in the Grave yard who felt Exasperated in there feelings  and He did not point out more than a doz graves which He had opened for fear he would be killed. No Estimate  can be made of the Number of the dead He has robed   ENDENTRY 1862 I would probably range from One to three Hundred some 10 graves were opened to day several of them were found robed He gave a list of some 15 Names which he had robed of late some of those graves have been opened and the bodies found  Naked. Venace in 1814. What will be done with the man I do not know   It was afterwords reported that John Baptist was branded in the forehead as A Robber of the dead, and croped and placed upon  Millers Island, and he undertook to cross onthe Lake on a frail Raft and was drowned as supposed as he never was heard of after. He robed the dead in Australia to such an Extent that he built a methodist meeting house with the avails of his robery so he testified.

But as to the punishment of the man to shoot or hang the man would not satisfy my feelings at all, it came to my mind when I first herd of it, if I should unDertake to punish him at all I would want to crop him and then print with  India ink upon his forehead (croped for robing the dead) 2nd discourse was making dancing Halls of our schools and meeting Houses.

I met at the 70 Hall at 7 oclok to deliver a lecture according to appointment the Hall was crouded to overflowing and  Hundreds Had to leave who could not get into the House the  following is a synopsis of my lecture   Brethren and Sisters I feel Happy in meeting with you  in this capacity. I think it more profitable for the saints to  meet together to hear lectures delivered upon the arts and scien- ces and various principles than to spend so much time in  danceing and light amusement. The subject which I wish  to speak upon this Evening is Journalizieing and History this  subject Embraces a wide Field far greater than I shall  attempt to Explore this Evening. History is given under two general Heads viz Sacred and profane and as spiritual  and temporal things are inseparably connected, so is sacred  and profane History many times is vary closely connected together. We have but vary little History in the Early ages  of the world Either Sacred or Profane, and but vary few His- torians or Journalists in any age of the world when   ENDENTRY 1862 compared with other callings and avocations of life. I shall not say much upon profane History during this Evening I will However refer to one or two prominent Historians. Rollins compiled an Elaberate History of the ancient Medes, Persians  Asyrians, Babylonians, and Caldeans. He gives a History of their  government customs Literature and Laws but more Esspecially  of their wars. I would recommend this History for our  yound young men to read who wish to become acquainted with an- cient History. I would also recommend the reading of Josepheus  the great Jewish Historian it appears to me that no man can  read with indiference His account of the siege of Jerrusalem by the Roman Army the destruction of their city and Temple their captivity and dispersion among the Gentiles Nations. Here in the  siege of Jerrusalem over one million of Jews perished inby the sword  famine, pestilence, and fire. I would also refer to the History of Greece  and Rome and Modern Europe and America or the History of any  Nation and ask how have we obtained the History of those Nations, Kingdom and Countrys. you may say that Historians  have handed those things down unto us, But How have Historians  obtained materials from which to compile therire History? I answer From the scribes, reporters, and Journalists who wrote  day by day Events as they passed before there Eyes and this  class of men forms the foundation of all History and from  there Material, Historians who live hundreds of years after Events transpire will compile History. But without material Historians cannot make History or any thing Else.   I will call your attention to what is called sacred or Bibli- cal History. Exiodus##  ##Leviticus##, ##Numbers##, and ##Deuteronomy|Dieuteronomy##. But He gives but vary little  History of the Early ages of man. We have a revelation in the  ##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53-54|doctrins and covenants## page 79 which says that "three years before  the death of Mahalaleel, Methuselah all who were High Priests with the residue of his posterity who were righteous into the valley of Adam Ondi Ahman and there bestowed upon them his  last Blessing and the Lord appeared unto them and they rose   ENDENTRY 1862 "Up and blessed Michael the Prince the  Archangel and the Lord administered comfort unto Adam and said unto him I have set thee to be at the Head a multitude of Nations shall come of thee and thou art a prince over them  forever." "And Adam stood up in the midst of the congregation and Notwithstanding he was bowed down with age being full of  the Holy Ghost predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the latest generation."  ##Doctrine and Covenants 107:55-56##THere was Adam and seven  of his sons all Aged Patriarchs who lived over nine  hundred years Except Mahalealel who lacked five years  of Being Nine hundred years of age. ##Genesis 5:16## Enoch was 365 years of  age when he was Translated. ##Genesis 5:23## Here was that great and glorious  meeting of those old Patriarchs and all the History we have of it those great Prophesies of Adam concerning what should  befal his posterity to the End of time is given to us in a few lines whare is there a latter day Saints who would not be  glad to read the Journal and History of that great Event.   Patriarchs and Prophets have left  to the world by there Journals and sacred records some History of the dealings of God with them. But there records were kept upon parchment and papyrus written in Hebrew, mingled with  many Hieroglyphics in order to convey their ideas and  principles to future generations, some of which have  been translated into the English language by the order  of King James which now forms the Bible. But what  a small History the Bible is of the dealings of God for  4000 years with the Nations of the Earth.   Christ Came in the meridian of time to Esstablish the gospel  and Kingdom of God upon the Earth. He organized the Church, chose  Twelve Apostles also Seventies and set the Church in order with  all the gifts graces and blessings. He administered the ordinances of the gospel, wrought many miracles and finished the work He was sent to do. But Jesus Christ with all the saints had to contend  with the world the flesh and the devel and Jew and Gentile and  the world overcome them and put them to death and the Church   ENDENTRY 1862 of Christ disappeared with that generation. What is the History of that generation? it is vary short. The four Evangelist  John, gives the History Biirth life and  death of the sSaviour. as near as we can learn Luke kept the Journals and done most of the writing He recorded the Acts  of the Apostles. Then Paul wrote his Epistles to the various  churches. Then Peter  wrote two short Epistles about as much as one of our  reporters would write in one short discourse. Then Jude  wrote one short chapter. Then John the Revelator when he was Banished to the Isle of Patmos under the reign  of Domician Cezar wrote his Revelations ##Revelation 1:9## after He was  recalled under the reign of Nervya He wrote his three  Epistles. this maks 8 writers in the New Testament and there testimony was vary limited, also their writings  as far as they have come to us, at least when we take into consideration the great work which they performed   The ancient Nephites who inhabited this con- tinent were commanded of God to write their history upon  Gold Plates which were hid up in the Earth to come forth  in our day to be translated by the Prophet Joseph through the power of God for the benefit of the Saints. This forms the Book of Mormon  and is the purest translation of ancient records that we have any knowledge of upon Earth yet this record gives but  a limited Idea of the dealings of God with that People yet what we have obtained was by strict commandment of God.   But let us turn our thoughts a moment to our own day. I  need not tell you that this is the kingdom of God, Esstablished by God Himself which is to take the place of all other kingdoms  upon Earth and we are the People Ordained of God to Esstab- lish his kingdom upon the Earth, build up Zion and prepare the way for the coming of Jeussus Christ. Now should we not keep a Journal, Record, and History of the dealings  of God with us as they transpire day by day before our Eyes?  we should. This Church and Kingdom is organized in all  the fulness of the Holy Priesthood necessary for the   ENDENTRY 1862 accomplishment of the work of God in this great  and fulness of times the  Church of Christ has been Esstablished in our day with Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, High Priests  Deacons, Gifts, graces Revelations and with all the ordinances Necessary for  the salvation of the children of ^men^. Joseph Smith was the  the first Apostle, Prophet, Seer, and Revelator called in  these Book of Mormon  and organized the Church of Christ as he was com- manded by the Revelations of Jesus Christ. When the Twelve Apostles were chosen and ordained The  Prophet Joseph gave them strict instruction to keep a record of there procedings (see the History of the Church Feb 1835)  The following Extract) "Since the Twelve are now appointed  and chosen I wish to tell them a course which they may  pursue and be benefitted in one point of light of which perhaps they are not now aware. At all times when you assemble in the capacity of a council to transact  business let the oldest preside and let one or more be appo- inted to keep a record of your proceedings, and on the decision of Every important decission item let it be what it may let such descision be noted own and they will ever afterwords  remain upon record as LAW, Covenant, and doctrin.   Questions thus decided might at the time appear unimportant but should they be recorded and one of you lay hands upon  them afterwards you might finds them of infinate worth not ownly to your Brethren but a feast to your own souls"    Many other remarks were made at the same time. The Prophet  Joseph always recommended the priesthood to keep a rec- ord of all their Official acts, and among his last letters to  the Church before he was slain he urges upon the Church  to be particular in there records of the Baptizesms for  the dead to be vary particular in there records of there  official acts, that what they bound on Earth should be bound in heaven and what they loosed on Earth should be loosed   ENDENTRY 1862 in heaven. and what you record on Earth shall be recorded in Heaven. President Brigham Young has also carried out the  same Principle since He has been president of the Church, in all  of our ordinances, Endowments, sealings and official acts He wishes us to be particular in recording the same. This Church is organized with a presidency of 3 men the Twelve Apostles also 63 Quorums of Seventies 4,410, Apostles and many thousands of Deacons. all  should keep a Journal of the dealings of God with them and there officials acts, and keep a true History of Events in this  great dispensation. I was inspired and moved upon to write a Journal and keep a record of the affairs of this Church from the time I first Joined this Church up to the Presient time. I seldom Ever heard the Prophet Joseph, or Brigham Young or the Apostles teach preach or Prophesy or perform any official act but what I have recorded it imn my Journals unless some other  persons were recording the same, and I could not feel Easy untill I had accomplished it. I have written more sacred History of the teaching of the prophets and Apostles and official acts of the Latter day Sants than would make several Testiments as large as the one Handed down to us by the Ancient Apostles  I have kept a Journal of almost Evry day of my life since  I have been a member of this Church. By refering to my Journals  I could tell Each day what I have done, the company I have been  in, and what was transpiring around me, and any council and  Teaching From the Presidency or Twelve Except whare I know  there were reporters recording the same. I have urged this same  course upon the Twelve and the other Quorums of the Church to keep  a record of there meetings and the dealings of God with them and  for all men who bear the Holy Pristhood to keep a record of  their lives or Esspecially of there official Acts, in the Church and kingdom of God. Some may say this is a great deal of trouble But we should not call any thing trouble which brings  to pass good. I consider that portion of my life which has been  spent in keeping Journals and writing History to have been vary  profitably spent. For instance the Lord gives unto us the Holy   ENDENTRY 1862 Priestood and we are sent on a mission to the Nations of the Earth, we go and Preach the gospel and bring many into the church  and the Power of the Holy Ghost rest upon us. We heal the sick, cast out devils, command the Elements and they obey us and the Lord gives unto us dreams visions and Revelations and many Blessings should we not have respect Enough to gGod to make a record of those Blessings which He pours out upon us and Our official acts which we do in his name upon the face of the Earth? I think we should.   For an Example we Embrace in our faith the belief that the Ten Tribes of Israel will return from the North Country unto Zion in the last days suppose that those Israelites should come to Zion in our day Led by the Holy Prophets of God what would be one of the first questions we would ask  them? it would be, whare are your records? show is us  your History we want to read an account of the dealings of the Lord with you since you were led away under Asyria ##2 Kings 18:9-11## But what would be our disappointment if they should ^say^ O we have not  kept any record or account of the great and mighty works of God among our tribes for many generations, we  have herd our Fathers say that thet Lord had done many great and marvelous works in there day we have also had  great Blessings while on our Journey to Zion from the North Country. The mountains o Ice flowed down before us and  there was a Highway cast up for us to walke in as there was to Israel when they came out of Cainan ##Joshua 3:16-17## and the Nations Trembled at our presence but we did not keep a record of these things we did not think any body would be particularly interested in it but ourselves. should we not be greatly disappointed at such information? we should and so would it be with them when they come to Zion and Enquire for the History of this church and kingdom if we were to tell them that we had not kept any History of the rise and progress of the Church. But instead of neglecting this branch of our work let Evry man who can keep a Journal and record   ENDENTRY 1862 Events as they pass before our Eyes day by day, this will make a valua- ble legacy to our children as and well a great Benefit to future gener- ations by giving them a true History of the rise and progress of  the Church and Kingdom of God upon the Earth in this last dispen- sation instead of leaving it to our Enemies to write a fals History of the true Church of Christ. Brethren and sisters we are making History Every day let that History be good let us do the works of righteousness that when our acts are recorded we shall be satisfied with them Either in time or Eternity I ask these Blessings in the Name of Jesus Christ Amen   I was followed by Judge Phelps who read two chapters of his new  translation from the bible he made some remarks upon his Early days    ENDENTRY February 13, 1862 ~ Thursday   13 I spent the day in the office    ENDENTRY February 14, 1862 ~ Friday   14 I spent the day in the office. In the Evening I attended the lectures at the 70' Hall. Orrelius Miner gave a lecture upon Law spoke over  an hour He was followed by Hosea Stout upon Politics.
