 OFFICE OF The First Presidency  of the Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints  P. O. Box B. Salt Lake City, Utah Nov. 3, 1896. 189  Prest. Henry S. Tanner, California Mission.  Dear Brother:  It gives us pleasure to inform you that we have appointed Elder Ephraim Nye to succeed you in the presidency of the California Mission. You will therefore please transfer to him all books, papers,  accounts and whatever else is necessary to enable him to satisfactorily take hold of the business of the Mission as well as of its spiritual  concerns, at whatever date is most convenient to you both; you will also give him all the information necessary to enable him to assume the  duties of his new position in the most acceptable manner. You will then be at liberty to return home whenever you deem it most proper.  While thus releasing you from the many and varied respon- sibilities connected with this mission, we feel to say that your earnest and devoted labors in the presidency are appreciated by us, and we  trust that you will continue to be highly blessed of the Lord in all your duties after you return to your home and friends in Zion.  Praying the Lord to bless you with a pleasant, safe and speedy journey home,  We remain, Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. Smith

If you accept it you will receive no further notification, but will be expected to present yourself at the Historian's Office to be set apart on the day previous to that appointed for your departure.  Your Brother in the Gospel, Wilford Woodruff  P.S. Please have your Bishop endorse your answer. 
 Salt Lake City, Jan[uar]y. 13, 1898 189  Elder William T. Ogden, Richfield.  Dear Brother:  Your name has been suggested and accepted as a Missionary to Samoa.  The work of the Lord is progressing in the nations, and faithful, energetic Elders are needed in the ministry to promulgate the Everlasting Gospel, openings for doing good appearing in numerous directions. Yourself, with others, having been selected for this mission, should there be no reasonable obstacles to hinder you from going, we would be pleased to have you make your arrangements to start from this City at as early a date as to leave San Francisco March 3rd, 1898.  Please let us know, at your earliest convenience, what your feelings are with regard to this call. If you accept it you will receive no further notification, but will be expected to present yourself at the Historian's Office to be set apart on the day previous to that appointed for your departure.

 [OF]FICE OF The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  P.O. Box, B.  Salt Lake City, Utah. Oct. 14, 1893.  Prest. W. T. Stewart, New Zealand.  Dear Brother:  Your favor of Aug. 12th reached our office while we were absent at the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, or it would have been answered by the last mail.  With regard to the matter the emigration of some of the Maori Saints that occupies the most prominent place in your communication we will say that, as you are aware, we have hitherto felt reluctant to encourage the wemigration of any of this people from their native islands to Zion; our experience with our Kanaka brethren and sisters not having been altogether encouraging; but after perusing your letter and learn- ing therefrom their characteristics, their industry and capability for such work as is incidental to the opening of a new country we have felt that a limited number of the best and most capable brethren and their families might at the present be permitted to gather, such ones as you and your associate missionaries would deem most suitable to meet and overcome the difficulties and peculiarities of so great a change in their mode of life as would be incidental to their removal to the^se^ mountains. Neither do we think it would be well to treat them as our emigrants of the white races are treated permit them when they reach here to make a way for themselves, locate where they choose and provide for their necessities as seems best to their judgment. We believe that it will be desirable to have our Maori friends placed in the charge of some one or more of the brethren who know their language and who have love and 
 sympathy for them as a people; and further that they be advised to settle in some district or region of our country where the climate is as suitable to them as can be found, and the natural productions consistent with the modes of life that will be most advantageous to them. In considering this matter, we have come to the conclusion that Kanab and its neighborhood will be as suitable for settlement by the limited number that you suggest, as any other portion of the inter-mountain region with which we are acquainted.  Such of the intending emigrants as can do so, of those whom you decide are proper persons to come, should accompany you on your return hiome, so that they can have the benefit of your counsel and guidance on the way. Further, we should be pleased to have you continue your supervision over them when they reach their future home, that they still may have a father to look to for the instruction, guidance and support that they will undoubtedly need. But of the details of this, and who shall be called to assist you, when such are needed, we can more fully arrange when we meet you.  It is probable that all the missionaries for whom you have asked for New Zealand, Australia and Tasmania will not leave by the November boat. The stringency of the times is such that a number of the brethren who have been called on foreign missions have not been able to raise their passage money by the time appointed and their departure has had to be postponed. So, we have reason to believe, will be the case with some of those called to labor under your presidency.  We will now say, Brother Stewart, that you are honorably released, with our approval and blessing on your labors, from the Presidency of the Australasian Mission, with the privilege of returning home whenever you consider the best interests of the mission will per- mit. You will please transfer to Elder William Gardner, who has been chosen to succeed you, all the books, papers and property of the mission, 
 and aid him in assuming his new duties by affording him all the informa- tion with regard to the churches and their members that lies in your  power.  It has been the custom to require half yearly Statistical Reports from the various Stakes of Zion and from the Foreign Missions, but at our last General Conference, it was decided that in future an Annual Report made up to December 31st of each year would better answer the purpose. In the past the reports have, in many cases, been incomplete covering various periods of time, and ending at almost every day of the calander year. This irregularity has robbed these reports of all reliability regarding the facts which they are intended to represent and made them misleading rather than trustworthy. It is hoped that this change will not only secure uniformity but completeness also, if an effort is made by the Secretaries and others, whose dutiy it is to attend to these things, to have them as perfect as possible. You will therefore make your next Statistical report include the period from the date of your last report to the end of this year, and annually thereafter.  The brethren chosen for Tasmania are Elders F. W. Ellis (North Ogden) and Lysander C. Pond (Pocatello). Elder Ellis is a man of fine ability, lengthy experience and a good singer. He is about 40 years of age. Elder Pond is a younger man, also well recommended. He has written for permission to have his wife accompany him, stating that she was a young woman admirably adapted for missionary work. We wrote back that Tasmania would be a hard missionary field for a sister, but if he still desired it, we would not object. At this writing, we have not learned which way he has decided. Two of the other brethren will be instructed to secure tickets for Sidney, and on their arrival you can change the field of labor of any or all of them as you, from your knowledge of the needs of the mission, may deem best. 
 With love to yourself, your fellow missionaries, and all the Saints,  We remain, Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. Smith 
 Salt Lake City, 8 April 1891  Elder William T. Stewart, Kanab.  Dear Brother:  Your name has been suggested and accepted as a Missionary to Australasia to preside in that mission.  The work of the Lord is progressing in the nations, and faithful, energetic Elders are needed in the ministry to promulgate the everlasting Gospel, openings for doing good appearing in numerous directions. Yourself, with others, having been selected for this mission, should there be no reasonable obstacles to hinder you from going, we would be pleased to have you make your arrangements to start from this City at as early a date as to sail from San Francisco, July 23rd, 1891.  Please let us know, at your earliest convenience, what your feelings are with regard to this call. If you accept it you will receive no further notification, but will be expected to present yourself at the Historian's Office to be set apart on the day previous to that appointed for your departure.  Your Brother in the Gospel, Wilford Woodruff  P.S. Please have your Bishop endorse your answer.

City Utah  Dear Brother  I enclose herewith the following described Fremont County Warranty which has been credited as Miscellaneous Tithing at the Rexburg T. O. at then face value.  From the best information I can glean I feel confident that L. M. Earl of Salt Lake City will pay as much for them as anyone, so that I send them to you direct believing that you can do better with them there than we can here I trust that if you cannot receipt us for their face value in Cash that you can probably do so in Misc.  They are all on Current expense fund. The first,  named I think is worth its face in cash. Those issued 7/22 I think soon will be and those issued 10/16 are probably not worth more than 70%.

 Mar 8th [189]8  Pres Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother  We quote the following  extract from a letter from Bp. Wm. B. Preston to us  under date of Mar 1st  "We beg to inform you that in the future we  can not allow the Tithing Department to be charged  with the expense of buggy for Pres. Ricks, as also  the feed and care of horses for him.  These items  must be eliminated from the amount of 1898 unless  permission is given in writing by the First  Presidency"  A word of explanation as to what we have been doing in this particular might not be out of place We have on hand a large two [axled] buggy that  was furnished for our use a few years ago under  the direction of Bp Preston.  We also have a buggy  harness here belonging to the Tithing Department Bro Ricks has furnished his own team gratuitously, but the expenses of feed, repairs, horshoeing etc have  been charged to the general expense account of our 
 Stake office. We estimate that between Fifty and  Fifty Five Dollars on Hay and Grass has been fed the team and about Twentyfive or Thirty Dollars  in repairs sharing etc per annum has been expended in keeping the outfit in a reasonable condition for  service.  Our reasons for so doing are that our  stake is so large that we felt that we could not  do justice to our duties in our official capacity  unless some convenience of this nature was provided.  While we have your attention we beg to state that under existing instructions we feel somewhat delicate  in drawing anything on our customary appropriation until receiving your order to do so. Should it meet  your approval an order for the amount usually  allowed Pres Ricks and Rigby would be appreciated  Brother Bassett feels in a condition to get along  without any for the present at least.  I shall be pleased to know your minds on both  matters mentioned above whenever convenient for you  to favor us with their consideration. With Kindest  regards we remain Yours Very truly  T E Ricks Wm F Rigby  T. E. Bassett 
 Jany 28 [189]8  Pres W. Woodruff Salt L. City Utah  Dear Brother:  We enclose herewith  communication from Elder Don. C. Driggs explaining itself.  If the arrangements are as  he states we have a misunderstanding of the case  Our impressions were that no one of our  missionaries to Montana were to be called for  only three months with the exception of those  who had previously had an experience in the  missionary field.  When Bro Jone Henry Smith was here  at our late Stake Conference Bro Drigg's name  was suggested for a mission to Montana but  on account of his business interests he was  allowed a certain length of time to make the  necessary preparations.  We are not posted as to whether any  other arrangements have been made by Bro John  Henry or yourself, and would be pleased to know 
 as to whether such is or is not the case so as to  be able to explain your wishes to Bro Driggs and give him the necessary information as to  his Railroad permit, License, setting apart etc upon his arrival here on Monday next  also as to whether his call is for three months  only.  With best wishes we remain  Your Brother  T E Ricks T. E. Bassett

 Mar 15th [189]8  Pres Wilford Woodruff and Counselors Salt L. City Utah  Dear Brethren:  I am in receipt of a  communication from Elder Geo Reynolds under date  of Mar 14th stating that you would be pleased to  learn from me what were my legal and other reasons  that caused me to look with disfavor on the  effort to remove the County Seat from St Anthony to Rexburg.  My legal reason is in Sec 2 Art 18  of our State Constitution which reads as  follows.  Sec 2 3 county seat shall be removed  unless upon petition of a majority of the  qualified elctors of the county and unless two  thirds of the qualified electors of the county  vote [for] the proposition at a general election  shall vote in favor of such removal. A [word faded] petition of removal of the county seat shall not be submitted in the same county  more than once in one year, except as provided 
 by existing laws.  The election that made St Anthony the  Permanent County seat was held in the fall of  1894. With some, I admit it is held that  the six year provision does not apply to the  first removal of a permanent county seat and  that it only refers to a proposition of removal after a similar attempt has been previously made  Others hold that it would apply with equal  propriety in a first attempt of removal. As to  just how the courts would interpret this is a  question that the future only could decide and  to combat the opposition that would undoubtedly  be made on this technicality in case of our  obtaining the necessary votes would unquestionably  entail considerable expenses and of course with our  favorable chances of losing even then.  A careful canvass of the votes by precinct  at our last election indicated very strongly to  me that it was an absolute impossibility to  acquire the necessary votes for its removal at the coming election and that an almost super human 
 effort would have t[o] be made to come anywhere  near that number involving an outlay of  thousands of dollars, much valuable time and a  serious division in the good feelings and unity of  our people that would inevitably result from  a contest of this nature.  With the growing sentiments in favor of  Rexburg by reason of our religious and educational  interest and the standing morality of our people and  the waning sentiment in favor of St Anthony  caused by the encouragements to crimes of various ^kinds^ given there and other causes, I felt that our vote  in the future say 2 or 4 years hence would be  stronger and that should ^we^ be successful in then  obtaining the necessary 2/3 vote all legal questions  that now embarras us would be removed without the expense and annoyance of having to  fight them in the courts.  While at Salt Lake City a few weeks ago  [text faded] see you personally on this matter I left  [text faded] us not only of 6 of the committee of  [text faded] but had been selected to investigate and 
 determine whether or not a contest should be  made but by others of our leading business  and influential men in the hands of Brother  Geo. F. Gibbs, all of whom sustained me in  the cource I took and to which I beg to refer  you for further information on this subject If however these are not sufficiently explanatory  I shall be pleased to answer any questions you  may desire to ask at any time.  I beg to assure you that my advice on this  matter was only taken after a careful consideration  of all sides of the question having in view the  best good of our people as a whole and with  no desire to harm even the ^an^ hair of the head of any man.  Hoping that at your convenience you  will favor me with your opinion as to whether  my cource in the premecis did or did meet  with your approval I remain  Yours very truly.  T E Ricks We endorce the above sentiments and Coincide with Pres Rick's actions in the foregoing.  Wm F Rigby Thos E. Bassett.

 Feb. 21 [189]8  President W. Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah  Dear Brother,  In connection with Bishop E. Z. Carbine we visited Arcadia Branch of Parker ward Sunday 13th inst. The branch has 22 families, a good  lively Sunday school, have built a comfortable meeting ^house^ 20 x 40 ft. which is paid for and on the occasion of our visit we dedicated the house.  It was the general opinion of myself the Bishop and the unanimous feeling  of the people that they should have a  ward organization. The branch is fifteen miles apart from Parker ward proper. The name of the ward was talked of  and decided upon viz: that it should be called Ora that being the name  of the Port Office. At a High Counsel 
 meeting held Saturday the 19th the subject was undecided and the name of Marian  Jo[se]ph [Kew] recommended for Bishop of t[h]at ward and we now submit the same  for your consideration. With kind regards We are  Your Brethren in the Gospel T E Ricks

 610  Mar 24  8 Pres. W. Woodruff and Counselors Salt L. City Utah  Dear Brethren:  Your favor of the 22nd  inst to hand in which you ask two further  question relative to the stand I took on the  county seat proposition, the first is:  When I  originally endorsed the movement was I not  acquainted with the arguments I now use, and if  I was, who did I at first countenance the effort.  Replying to this I beg to say that I do not wish  to be understood as originally endorsing the move, but  after considerable agitation by[ illegible] our citizens  I did consent and took part in appointing a  council to simply investigate what could be  done and whether as it ^was^ contended by some to  say as a absolutely [clear] legally, and to report their  findings before any definite action should be  taken, but that I at first countenanced the action  of [illegible] I most explicitly deny.  After this committe has made their report I can  [illegible] the approval by 
 technicalities [illegible] though we might perchance  surmount[ illegible] an expense that I felt  [illegible] would ^be^ [illegible] to incur.  I had also by this time  made a [illegible ] of the [illegible ] we might  reasonably expect in our favor, which demonstrated to  me it was better to drop the matter for the present as [illegible]  Your second question was, why I declined to give  those interested the reasons for any change of base. I [illegible] to say as before that stated, that I had not  changed my base, but that I invited some of the  members of this community to meet me at my office  at a given time, that I might give them my  [illegible ] in this matter, they however invited others not of our faith and who had previously proven  [illegible ] to our people to offend and while  those [illegible] were all presentI did not feel at  liberty to speak as freely on the subject as I  otherwise would have done.  I was there and then  in my own office indirectly accused of being  bribed by one of our own brethren in the presence  of a roomfull of those interested,  
 left the office before I had an opportunity of  speaking to him as freely as I otherwise would have  been pleased to do.  These brethren are the facts  in the case as far as I am able to tell them at  present.  If however there is anything further that  you wish to ask I shall be pleased to answer them  as far as I am able.  Awaiting your further  pleasure I remain  Your [illegible] T. E. Ricks
