Elders B Young H. C.  Kimball and J Taylor went forward and Baptized  about 40 persons. Elders G. A. Smith  and myself assisted in confirming them.

All that are pliable in the hands of  God and are obedient to the commands of God are  vessels of honour and God will receive them  Joseph the Seer said the above was a true explai- nation of the parable ##Jeremiah 18##  (After Sidney Roberts had occupied  the meeting a season) Joseph the Seer arose and read a  chapter in the New Testiment containing the parable  of the vine and its branches and explained it much to our edif- ication and said "if we kept the commandments of  God we should bring forth fruit and be the friends of  God and know what our Lord did ##John 15:1-8##, "Some say Joseph is  a fallen Prophet because he does not bring forth more  of the word of the Lord" "why does he not do it "are we able to receive it No (says he) not one in this  room, He then chastized us for our wickedness  and unbelief knowing that whom the Lord loveth he  chasteneth and scourgeth evry son and daughter whom  He receiveth and if we do not receive chastizement then  are we bastards and not sons. ##Hebrews 12:5-11## On Revelation He  said "A man would command his son to dig  potatoes, saddle his horse but before he had done  either tell him to do sumthing els, this is all considerd  right "But as soon as the Lord gives a command ment and revokes that decree and commands sumthing  els then the prophet is considerd fallen andc"  Because we will not receive chastizment at the  hand of the Prophet and Apostles the Lord chast- izeth us with sickness and death. Let not any man  Publish his own righteousness for others can do that  for him." sooner let him confess his sins and then he  will be forgiven and he will bring forth more fruit ENDENTRY April 6, 1844 ~ Saturday   A Special Conference held at Nauvoo  April 6th AD 1844   Conference assembled at 10 oclock AM April 6  President B, Young, called the conference to  order. President Joseph Smith said he should  not occupy time in speaking of any difficulties  that might have occured in our midst,  said he was not a fallen prophet, and never in  any nearer relationship to God than at the  present time, and would show before the conferen  closed that God was with him. Prayer by  Sidney Rigdon  arose and said it was with no ordinary feelings  he arose to speak, a privilege which he had  not before enjoyed in the same capacity for  five years, and the circumstances of the  occasion points out to me my text which is  the saints of the last Days. I remember in  1830 all the church met in a log cabin, whare  we conversed extensively about laying the  foundation of this kingdom, our minds  expanded far and wide while contemplating  this subject even in that day we talked  as large then as now, we spoke of Great things  that the world could not bear and that is  the reason why we were in secret the world  would laugh and consider us fools and even mob  us becaus we talked about things that wer true  and have and will come to pass yet things that  looked impossible to them because they did  not view them by faith as we do, and if we  should still convers about things in secret it  would be upon the same principle for we   ENDENTRY are not willing to bear the scoffs of the world  any longer unnessarily had we told openly  and talked openly of the things of God that have  and will come to pass our blood would have  been shed we should not have been here  this day. But we hid ourselves up in secret,  there we talked wept, and prayed and the Angels  Administered unto us and the spirit of God was  with us and the heavens opened unto us, but we  should now have been in our grave had we  proclaimed unto the world what God showed  unto us, notwithstanding it was for the benef- it of man, and for his salvation, and not for evil The appearance of this congregation this day  shows the fulfillment of the revelations of  Jesus Christ given in those days. No incident has  taken place in this day but what we spoke of at that early period, all those things were  deeply impressed upon the mind by the God of  Heaven. How could you be made to believe that  you did not live in Nauvoo and have not got habit- ations. Neither could we disbelieve this to be the  Church of God, we cannot disbelieve it for we  see hear and feel. I have always known it to be  I cannot see otherwise. Have I not seen Gods  glory by the visions of heaven yea I have then  what have we to do with the little difficulties  on earth nothing. Those were the beginning  of Good days shut up in a little shop with  nothing to eat but a little Jonnycake and milk and water  ownly as we would occasionlly shoot a squirrel  and we lived in an old smokey house, still we  rejoiced in the things God was revealing unto  us: many think it hard to live in Nauvoo but  we counted those good days God had given   ENDENTRY us great things, dont think strange if  men dont think of great things when I  obtained a great and glorious principle I felt  like locking it up lest the people would laugh  at me. And while we were together and telling  one thing we would learn another; I speak of these things to do away with the notion  or feelings about our secret meetings  was their any thing wrong then no, neither  will their be now. No, I have no fear of it what God does is for my salvation and the  salvation of man, and I say go ahead. I have spoken of the grand principle of  the beginning, and I have marvelled at  one thing ie after the foundation of the  church men crept in that were vary  wise more so than God professed to know,  more some of them, it has kept the church  in a continual broil, it was so in the days  of Moses but he disposed of them he killed  them or the Lord destroyed them.    I will leave this subject and show why  salvation belongs to the Priesthood of God  and why it belongs to us as a people. Men  labor under a mistake ie salvation is distinct  from goverment, salvation is always the  result of goverment evry man has a right to  govern himself in a goverment, as evry good  is a part of the goverment and the laws is for  the defence of a man, we see the need  of laws in this city for their is evil to dispose of  here. I have seen some trials in this city  what some persons were tried for insulting  the Marshall, but any other man is as good as   ENDENTRY the Marshall, many other usful remarks  were made by the speaker, when he gave  way untill the Afternoon    Was followed with many usful remarks  from Elder Taylor. The stand was occupied  with with eleven Lamanites chiefs braves andc   At 2 oclok the conference Assembled and  resumed his subject and said we were discusing  in the morning service upon the history of  the Church of Jesus Christ. its a miserable man  that could not manufactor his own text. I have  known many a sermon spoiled by a bad tex The Church of Jesus Christ then. The Hights  of testimony, and amount of evidence that many  of those have had that have fallen away, has  been of such a nature that when they say  they dont believe this work to be true they  lie. The things that were done in secret  in the begining are now seen openly and  their is nothing secret now but what all  will know in time to come, I am aware  their is many things I did not hint at I will  speak of them now. I have seen the time  when the Presidency of the Church sitting  now before me were locked up with me in  secret places waiting upon God we did not  go out at all but to eat andc But it was soon  found out, and a mob came, saying God damn  you to Hell, and threatened our lives, it was at this  time we sat for hours sin the Visions of heaven  around the throne of God and gazed upon the  scenes of Eternity. one evening a Mexican  called upon us and he went out armed to see   ENDENTRY to see a dozen armed men in the cornor  of the fence, he wanted to shoot them, after- wards the mob came in and broke the door, took  me and dragd me out through the streets by my  heels with my head pounding over the frozen  ground. Another company took presiden  Smith, and tar and feathered him, they tried to tar and turn Aquiphertos aqua fortis down our our throats  this is the reason why we were in secret,  under lock and key. Now if you will let us  work openly we will not work in secret we will work openly as much as you want.  I think I have said enough already to show  that the church has come up through great  tribulation, let this suffice then upon this  subject. Their is men standing in your midst  who are not afraid of men or devels and  men whos mouths cannot be stoped unless  you take their lives for they will speak  in defence of the innocent of virtue and truth  while they live, their is men in your midst  who have learned their is a great God who  can do as he pleases take up the Hills as a  little thing, and such men do not fear  death, they know about heaven they have  seen it and know all about it, their is men  in your midst which you must sustain or  go to Hell, save them and you save yourselves  reject them and you go to Hell. We are 14  years of age now chuse your guardeen  and when you get to be 21, then do business  for youselves you can save yourselves or  Damn yourselves you have just men among  you and the reason is because God has taught   ENDENTRY them chose and ordained them and this is the reason why they are so. you have men in your midst who will not turn to the right hand or left if you are in their path you must get out you cannot cort by favor or welth or any thing els, they do not ask Poleticians kings or people for favor, they ask God for it alone if the world make them rich or poor they never ask for it. The man whom God has raised up to lay the foundation of this work is placed in such a situation that he cannot fall and He is so lovely that I cannot get mad at him. This is an important part in the History of the Church, the cry of some is I shall not get office if these men are not put down, well God intended to keep them fearing when God sets up his kingdom he will sustain it above all laws and kingdoms of the world and the world has no power over the kingdom of God, the laws will be so strict that the world will make to try to ketch the saints that it will hang themselves by the wholesale. we want to build up the Laws of God in Hancock Co. I dont care any thing about all the laws in the world for I will live above them, God teaches his servants to respects kings Gov Presidents, and men in authority. But I have a right to proclaim myself a king and priest unto the most High God, yet I will not transgress  your laws, but dont do as they did in Missouri kill people because they would not bre break the law. I dont want any office in this goverment for I am determined to be a king in the kingdom of God, what be   ENDENTRY king in heaven and quarrel about the office of constable on earth. The kingdom of God may rise up in the midst of the kingd of the world and live above all laws, and not be a law abiding man, I will live above all law I will pay my taxes and obey all requirments that the goverment has uppon me. the reason we was mob in Mo was because we would not have any thing to do with the laws we did not break any we lived above them so they sent a mob upon us. The kingdom of God to the world would be a light in a dark place. The kingdom of God could be set up in any kingdom or country and not break the law but live above it. conference Adjourned till to morrow morning    ENDENTRY April 7, 1844 ~ Sunday   April 7th Sunday the sun plesent air calm and serene and a vast multitude of about twenty thousand souls assembled together after singing and prayers President Rigdon arose and said, Our borders are enlarged this morning. I shall preach from the same tex we preached from yesterday The Church of Jesus Christ, the Kingdom of God, the leven, the little stone spoken of by Daniel andc. The testimony given would let the kingdom of God exhist in any goverment Monarchiel or Republican. We intend to show why salvation belongs to this Church ownly. The kingdom of God is a goverment that exerciseing its ownly power in evry respect its ownly it holds a place on the   ENDENTRY mind, not by force of Arms, but by free will because they want to do the will of God and it is accomplished by truth itself that is manifest from Heaven by intelligence that he sees in heaven and it is power in itself it is on this principle that power rests the Lord begins to teach a man what he can do and if he never would know what he was taught he never would know what he could do. No people can com- prehend it but the Church of God, then one of the main things in the kingdom of God is to let a man know what to do, what glory kingdom and power he can gain, man is taught a principle that when it enters the mind it has a power over death, plagues, sickness, the gift of miracles, this is one great eviden of the work the power of God, this then is the kingdom of God. All religions then that there is in the world that has not these things has a tendency to do hurt instead of doing good for it teaches those things are done away. God has said he would take all the kingdoms of the world out of the way, he would Break in peases and subdue and he would teach the kings and all powers the way that they may have a chance. We say then their is no power any whare els unto salvation. Isaiah said the wilderness should blossom as the rose the lame leap, the blind see, we have got this power here yet the world says it is an imposition. when he comes, He will save you, the lame shall leap, Deaf hear, Blind see, he will come so you need not have sickness or lameness, Man ^But^ man has proclaimed salvation in the earth, when we exercise the   ENDENTRY the keys of the kingdom of God who can oppose it not war with the sword but with another power, the world has always been sheding Blood. I proclaim peace not war, and this is what he calls the kingdom. Has not the kingdom of God a right to extend in any part of the world to do good. Beat swords into plow shares and spears into pruning hooks, and it shall be a kingdom of glory, peace, ^and^ salvation. Let no man be alarmed because the Lord said that the kingdom of God should swallow up all other kingdoms what harm would it do for all the world would have the same spirit, the Lord said he intended to do by the whole world the same as he has done by us, and this is the thing the world is afraid of, reflect then. This is as far as I intended to go upon this subject, A word then upon the Materials to carry on this kingdom. Any man Publicans, sinners, scoundrals or any body els could repent and receive the gospel and become a member of the kingdom as well as the good for when Jesus came he came to call sinners and Harlots came into the kingdom. It dont requir much of an exhertion of the mind, much depends however upon the decision of the mind, it depends upon one action of the mind A man remarked to me He did not belong to a church was not worthy, but this is a mistake. Jesus Christ came to save sinners He saves the unworthy. The Lord will offer a man salvation he says he is not worth, but what would you want your son to do if he was unworthy. He should return to his  father, so with God. He calls to the world to return by Baptism. He cannot make him self any better, but decid with the mind   ENDENTRY today then the Lord begins to teach him the the things of God and heaven and I will make you like myself. I will give you my spirit and make you feel like my family, and this is the  pivot to a God then decide and go and be Baptized then you will be in the way of salvation, if he decide otherwise he will not be any better. A word upon the spirit, this noble decision of the mind causes angels to rejoice in the Heavens for their is more joy over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just persons evry person can do this and no man can do a better work, let no man say they are unworthy. I wish all the teachers of the day could hear me. I was a Baptist and preached their doctrin and was hampered, and hampered others in my teachings and all the teachers of the day do the same. they may be honest but they teach fals doctrins, they call people to the anxious bench and keep them down untill they will say they are willing to be damned But I never was willing to be damned, the doctrin Peter taught was different from sectarianisms. His doctrin was repent and be Baptized and you shall receive the Holy ghost, take a view of this subject look at the spirit of promise, view the congregation on that day they were stranger not having a knowledge of salvation they were strangers to the power of God and did not know  that Jesus Christ was crusified and all they knew about it was what Peter told them on the day of Pentecost, 14 vrs of 2 ch of Acts the ownly knowledge they had about the Holy Spirit was what Peter taught them by quoting the prophet Joel 37 ver now mark this   ENDENTRY Peter had defined the spirit of God of the fruits of it be Prophecy, dreams, visions, revelations andc yes this is the spirit of God the spirit of Prophecy, dreams, visions, heal the sick, and all the great things, and I will in the last days pour out my spirit upon all flesh. this is the definition of the Spirit. All were called to be baptized without any exceptions, villians Harlots Scoundrel and all. A question, how long would it take the sectarian religion before they would prophesy and have the gifts of the spirits of God, it would take seven eternities to do it for it is on a different scheme. I will come to an Anxious bench and get as good a convertion as can be got at an anxious bench, will I be converted to Gods? No, I will be converted to an anxious bench. If I had been converted to God I should have been Prophesying According to the words of Joel, for He said the spirit of God should be poured out upon all flesh and I believe I am flesh and I believe you are flesh and I believe we are in the last days, I will now sum up the testimony, what is a man to preach when they go out, tell the people to repent quit their iniquity be Baptized and you shall recieve the Holy ghost, dream dreams, see visions, and prophecy and if they dont tell them this they preach another gospel.   ENDENTRY 3 oclok PM  ENDENTRY April Sunday 7th 1844 FIGURE The following important edefying and interest- ing discourse was delivered by President. Joseph Smith to about twenty thousand souls upon the subject of the death of Elder King Follet   I now call the attention of this congregation while I addres you upon the subject of the dead The case of our Beloved Brother King Follet who was crushed to death in a well as well as many others who have lost friends will be had in mind this afternoon and shall speak upon the subject in general as far as I shall be inspired by the Holy spirit to treat upon the subject. I want  the Prayers and faith of the saints that I may have the Holy Ghost, that the testimony may carry conviction to your minds of the truth of what I shall say, and pray that the Lord may strengthen my lungs, there is strength here  your prayers will be herd. Before I enter upon an investigation of this subject, I wish to pave the way, and bring up the subject from the beginning that you may understand. I do not intend to please you with oritory but with the simple truths of heaven Edify you. Go to the morn of creation to understand of the decrees of the Eloheem at the creation. It is necessary for us to have an understanding of God at the beginning, if we get a good start first we can go right, but if you start wrong you may go wrong. But few understand the character of God. they do not know they do not understand their relationship to God. the world know no more than the brute beast, and they know no more than   ENDENTRY to eat drink and sleep and this is all man knows  about God or his exhistance, except what is given  by the inspiration of the Almighty. go then to  the beginning that you may understand. I ask this congregation what kind of a being is God?  turn your thoughts in your hearts, and say have any  of you seen or herd him or communed with him  this is a question that may occupy your attention The scriptures inform us that this is eternal life  to know the ownly wise God and Jesus Christ whome  He has sent.    If any inquire what kind of a  being God is I would say If you dont know God  you have not eternal life, go back and find out  what kind of a being God is. If I am the man  that shows you what kind of a being God  is, then let evry man and woman sit in silence  and never lift up his hand against me again  if I do not do it, I will not make any further  pretentions to inspiration or to be a prophet  I would be like the rest of the world, fals teachers  and you would want to take my life. But you  might just as well take the lives of other fals teaches  as mine if I was fals, But meddle not with  any man for his religion, evry goverment ought  to permit evry man to enjoy his religion. I will  show the world is ^w^rong by showing what God is  I am going to inquire after God so that you  may know God, that persecution may cease  concerning me. I go back to the beginning to  show what kind of a being God was. I will  tell you and hear it O Earth! God who sits  in yonder heavens is a man like yourselves That GOD if you were to see him to day that  holds the worlds you would see him like a  man in form, like yourselves. Adam was   ENDENTRY made in his image and talked with him, walked  with him. In order to understand the dead for  the consolation of those that mourn, I want  you to understand God and how he comes to be  God. We suppose that God was God from  eternity, I will refute that Idea, or I will do  away or take away the veil so you may see. It is  the first principle to know that we may convers  with him and that he once was man like us,  and the Father was once on an earth like us,  And I wish I was in a suitable place to tell it.  The scriptures inform us mark it that Jesus Christ  said As the Father hath power in himself ss so hath  the son power in himself to do what the father  did even to lay down my body and take it up again  do you believe it if not dont believe the bible I defy all Hell and earth to refute it. And you  have got to learn how to make yourselves God, king  and priest, by going from a small capacity  to a great capacity to the resurrection of the dead  to dwelling in everlasting burnings. I want you  to know the first principle of this law, how cons- oling to the mourner when they part with a friend  to know that though they lay down this dody body it will rise and dwell with everlasting burnings to  be an heir of God and joint heir of Jesus Christ  enjoying the same rise exhaltation and glory untill  you arive at the station of a God. what did Jesus  Christ do, the same thing as I se the Father do  see the father do what work out a kingdom, when  I do so to I will give to the father which will add to  his glory, he will take a Higher exhaltation and I  will take his place and am also exhalted. These  are the first principles of the gospel. It will take  a long time after the grave to understand the whole If I should say any thing but what was in the bible  the cry of treason would be herd I will then  go to the Bible.   ENDENTRY Barasheet in the beginning, Analize the word  in and through the head, an old Jew added the word  Bath, it red the head one of the gods, broat forth  the gods. I will transpose it in the english language.  I want you to know and learn that the Holy Ghost knows sumthing. The grand Council set  at the head and contemplated the  creation of the world, some will say the script- ures say so and so, but I will show you a text  out of an old book containing the four langua ges, the german is here what does this text  say, yoakabeam, the son of Zebedee, the  bible says James the son of Zebedee, but this  says Jacob son of Zebedee 21 ch 4th ver Matthew  The Dr says (I mean Dr of Law not of physic)  If you say any thing not according to the Bible  we will cry treason, But if ye are not led by  revelation how can ye escape the damnation  of Hell, here we have the testimony of four. I have  the oldest Book in the world and the Holy Ghost I thank God for the old Book but more for  the Holy Ghost. The Gods came together and  concocked the plan of making the world and the  inhabitants, having an knowledge of God we  know how to Approach him and ask and he will answer  An other thing the learned Dr says the Lords  made the world out of nothing, you tell  them that God made the world out of  sumthing, and they think you are a fool. But  I am learned and know more than the whole  world, the Holy Ghost does any how, and I will  associate my self wit it. Beaureau to organize  the world out of Chaotic matter, element  they are principles that cannot be disolved  they may be reorganized. Another subject  which is calculated to exhalt man I wish to  speak of. The resurrection of the dead   ENDENTRY The soul the mind of man, whare did it  come from. The learned says God made it  in the beginning, but it is not so, I know better  God has told me so. If you dont believe it, it wont  make the truth without effect God was a self  exhisting being, man exhist upon the same prin- ciple. God made a tabernacle and put a spirit in it  and it became a Human soul, man exhisted in  spirit and mind coequal with God himself, you  who mourn the loss of friends are ownly seper- ted for a moment, the spirit is seperated for  a little time, they are now conversant with  each other as we are on the earth. I am dwel- ling on the immutibility of the spirit of man, is  it logic to say the spirit of man had a begining  and yet had no end, it does not have a begining  or end, my ring is like the exhistanc of man  it has no begining or end, if cut into their  would be a begining and end, so with man  if it had a begining it will have an end if  I am right I might say God never had power  to create the spirit of man, God himself could  not create himself. Intelligence is Eternal  and it is self exhisting. All mind that is susseptible  of improvement, the relationship we have  with God places us in a situation to advance in  knowledge. God has power to institute laws  to instruct the weaker intelligences that they  may be exhalted with himself this is good d doctrin, it taste good. I can taste the principles  of eternal life, so can you, they are given  to me by the revelations of Jesus Christ and I  know you believe it. All things ^that^ God sees fit  to reveal to us in relation to us, reveals his comma- ndments to our spirits, and in saving our spirits  we save the body, (the same as though we had no (Body   ENDENTRY How comes the awful responsibility if in relation  to our dead, if they do not be baptized they must  be damned. (I wish I had 40 days to talk) what  promises are made, what can be said if in the  grave, God dwells in eternity, and he does not  view things as we do, the greatest responsibility  lade open us in this life is in relation to our dead Paul cannot be made perfect without us, for it is  necessary that the seals are in our hands to seal our  children and our dead for the fulness of the dispensation  of times, A dispensation to meet the promises made  by Jesus Christ befor the foundation of the world  for the salvation of man. All sins and blasphemys  were to be forgiven except the sin against the  Holy Ghost. God has made provision for evry spirit  in the eternal world, and the spirits of our  friends should be searched out and saved. Any man  that has a friend in eternity can save him  if he has not commit the unpardonable sin. He  cannot be damned through all eternity, their is  a possibility for his escape in a little time. If a  man has knowledge he can be saved, if he has been  guilty of great sins he is punished for it, when he  consents to obey the gospel whether, Alive or dead,  he is saved, his own mind damns him I have no  fear of hell fire that dont exhist. No man can  commit the unpardonable sin, untill He receives  the Holy Ghost. All will suffer untill they obey  Christ himself, even the devil said I am a savior  and can save all rose up in rebelion against God  and was cast down. Jesus Christ will save  all except the sons of perdition. What must  a man do to commit the unpardonable sin  they must receive the Holy Ghost have the  heavens opened unto them, and know God and then  sin against him, this is the case with many   ENDENTRY apostates in this Church they never scease to try to hurt me, they have got the same spirit the devil had, you cannot save them, they make open  war like the devil, stay all that hear, dont make any hasty mooves you may be saved, if a spirit of Bitterness is in you, dont be in haste, Say you that man is a sinner, well if he repents he shall be forgiven. I could go back and trace evry subject of interest concerning the relationship of man to God if i had time, their is many mansions in my fathers Kingdom, what have we to console  us in relation to our dead, we have the greatest hope in relation to our dead of any people on earth we have seen them walk worthy on earth and those who have died in the faith are now in the selestial kingdom of God, they have gone to await the resurrection of the dead to go to the celestial glory, while their is many who die who will have to wait many years. But I am authorized to say to you my friends in the name of the Lord that you may wait for your friends to come forth to meet you in Eternity in the morn of the celestial world, those saints who have been murdered in the persecution shall triumph in the Celestial world while their murderers shall dwell in torment untill they pay the utmost farthing.   I have Fathers, Brothers, Children, that are gone to eternity soon to meet me, the time will soon be gone, the trump will soon be blown. A question will Mothers have their Children in Eternity? yes, yes, you will have the Children ^But^ as it falls so it will rise. It will never grow. It will be in its precise form as it fell in its mothers arms. Eternity is full of thrones upon which dwell thousands of children reigning on thrones of glory not one cubit added to their stature   ENDENTRY I will leave this subject here and make a few remarks upon Baptism. I will read a tex in Jerman upon Baptism. John says I Baptise you with water but when Jesus Christ comes He shall administer the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost. John said his baptism was good for nothing without the baptism of Jesus Christ. Many talk of any baptism not being essential to salvation but this would lay the foundation of their damn ation. There has also been remarks made concern- ing all men being redeemed from Hell, But I say that any man who commits the unpardon- able sin must dwell in hell worlds without end   Conference adjourned till to morrow 10 oclock   ENDENTRY April 8, 1844 ~ Monday   Conference met at 10 oclok April 8th President J Smith arose and said it is impossible to continue the subject that I spoke upon yesterday in consequence of the weekness of my lungs. Yet I have a proclamation to make to the Elders you know the Lord has led the church untill the present time. I have now a great proclamation for the Elders to teach the church here after which is in relation to Zion. The whole of North and South America is Zion, the mountain of the Lords House is in the centre of North and South America, when the house is done, Baptism font erected and finished and the worthy are washed, anointed, endowed and ordained kings and priests, which must be done in this life, when the place is prepared you must go through all the ordinances of the house of the Lord so that you who have any dead friends must go through all the ordinances for them the same as for yourselves; then the Elders are to go through all America and build up Churches untill all Zion is built up, but not to commence to do this untill the Temple is built up here and the Elders endowed then go forth and accomplish the work and build up stakes in all North and South America. Their will be some place ordained for the redeeming of the dead I think this place will be the one, so their will be gathering fast enough here. President Smith lungs failed him and he appointed elder G. J. Adams to occupy the time during the foornoon He however remarked that his proclamation just made was the greatest ever made as all could not come here, but it was necessary that enough should come to build up the temple and get an endowment so that the work could spread abroad   ENDENTRY Elder Adams took a text in Obadiah 17 vers  upon Mount Zion shall be deliverance andc He spoke lengthy concerning Zion that was to be built up  in the last days and pointed out Joseph from the  scriptures and brought much testimony to prove the subject. At the close of the discourse President Joseph Smith turned over the confer- ence into the hands of the Twelve And Adjourned untill 2 oclok. Met at 2 oclok and President Hiram Smith arose and spent most of the Afternoon in scoreing the elders to try to teach them wisdom, that they might act in wisdom when they go out to preach conference Adjourned untill to morrow morning at 8 oclk    ENDENTRY April 9, 1844 ~ Tuesday   April 9th Conference persuant to adjournment at 8 oclok President B Young in the Chair Elder Amasa Lyman made some appropriat remarks had followed men that done more hurt than good flung more obstructions in the way than they took out had taken half of his time to remove prejudice caused by unwise Elders, for God sake dont preach a thing you dont know, dont appear before the public in a capacity you cannot maintain A man in Iowa called a congregation the first thing he did was to read a Patriarchal blessing which had some strong meat in it, he would have done better to have preached the gospel   I had rather hear brethren appear small than large I had rather see a man hold his brother up than pull him down. Preach what will save men the same that converted you will convert them.   Elder B Young arose and the above doctrin was true and I will add a remark to it if a man tries to rise by pulling   ENDENTRY another down he will sink as soon as a peace of pot mettle. Preach faith repentance and Baptism say nothing but repentance to this generation need not go into mysteries preach the same over again when I heard Br Joseph make his proclamation yesterday I thought it was a sweepstakes when he said North and South America was Zion. Any Elder that will be wise when he gets his endowment can go into any city and build up the largest church in the city this prooves the prophet true, that the priesthood is fitted for the condition of evry man and woman that was on the earth. will the elders go out this season and preach the things we tell them to and then stop, build up churches in all the world is a perfect knock down to mobs, now Mo Mob away and best let us alone and we will evangelize the world and not make much fuss about it, mob us and we will do it sooner. We want the Elders to electioneer for President Smith and we want to build the temple this season and by the help of God you ^we^ will do it. Pay your tithing if you want a seat in that house. many other usful remarks was made by Elder Young. Conference Adjourned untill 2 oclok. Met according to adjournment and called to order by president Brigham Young President Joseph Young proceded to ordain a number of Elders into the quorum of the Seventies B Young remarked O ye Elders of Israel you are the first fruits of the kingdom of God on the earth that is to swallow up all other kingdoms on the earth, now be wise and not fools like many smart young men who have sunk themselves in degradation and infamy, when you go out go before God in prayer and faith. Joseph said he was not known in our midst, he might live and die and not be fully known untill he was weighed in the balance in the eternal world. You do not fully know the day   ENDENTRY of your visitation the work is beginning to be seen by the Saints, when J. C. Bennet went forth to  try to destroy the Saints. A little company of us  went before God and asked him to take away his  power, and it fell like lightning from Heaven we asked for Duncan not to be Govornor he was  not but he is now dead and damned. We asked  for Reynolds to be taken away, he soon shot  himself and went to Hell. Carlin is dead and so  our enemies have fallen on evry hand, whare is  the officers of Government in Washington seven were hurled into eternity in an instant by  the bursting of a big gun, the bitter branches  are beginning to be cut off, take care O, man how  you oppose this work for their is a God in Israel cannot you practice virtue and holiness in this  church yes and it is the corrupt and wicked  that oppose the work, go out and do good and work  righteousness.    W. W. Phelps said we want to  get up a general meeting in Nauvoo as a kind of  convention and we want to do the same in all  the saints states.

Comstock, and Dr Hood.   At the adjournment of the conference the Elders  were again called together and President C. C. Rich  Proceded to appoint the Elders their stations in the  different Counties in the State Adjourned sine die (W. Woodruff President)  (Crandell Dunn) (E. M.

I had  some council from Elder Young concerning the  affairs of the kingdom my mishion andc    ENDENTRY August 18, 1844 ~ Sunday   18th FIGURE Sunday I met I vast congregation  of the Saints at the grove to hear a discourse  from President Young upon the present excite- ment that is through Nauvoo in consequence of  unwise teaching by some that are trying to  draw away a party after them the following is  a synopsis of the discourse   President Young arose and said that he had ^I have^ many  things to speak of. It was my mind in the first  place that we should have suitable time to meditate  upon all matters and weigh them, even evry  subject wharein we felt interested. When the  question was asked me if they should con tinue to Baptise for the dead. I said I had no  council to give upon that subject at that time ^present^ but  should think it not best to attend to it at that  time. I have learned some things I did not know  when I came home. I discover a disposition in  the sheep to scatter abroad now the shepherd is taken  away. I do not say that it will never be right for  this people to go from here or scatter abroad but let  them wait untill the time comes and untill they  get Council to do so. The report has gone forth through  the city that the Twelve has have a secret understanding    ENDENTRY with those men who are going away to take a ^and taking^ company with them, that they shall take all  they can but ^although^ the Twelve will blow it up in  public but ^yet^ privately ^they^ wish it to go on, but if  it was the last words I had to say before going into  the Eternal world I would swear by the Holy  Trinity that it was ^is^ utterly fals and not a word  of truth in it, their is no man ^that has^ any right to  lead away one soul out of this city by the consent  of the Twelve, except Geo  Miller ^who have^ had the privilege of taking the Pine Company  whare they pleased but not any other another soul has  the consent of the Twelve to go with them. Their ^There^  is no man ^who has^ any liberty to lead away people into  the wilderness from this Church or to lead them  any whare els not by the consent of the Twelve  or the Church except the case above named and  I tel you in the name of Jesus Christ, that if  Lyman Wight and Geo Miller take a course contrary  to our council, and will not act in consent with  us but take a course against us they will be  damned and go to destruction, and if men  will not stop striving to be great and exhalted and  lead away parties from us and strive to weaken  our hands they will fall and not rise again. and  I will destroy their influence in this church with  the help of God and my brethren. I wish you to  distinctly to understand that the Council of the  Twelve is for evry family that does not belong to the  Pine Company to stay here in Nauvoo, and build up  the Temple and get your endowment, dont  scatter. United we stand divided we fall. it has  been whispered about that all that go into the  wilderness with Wight and Miller will get their  endowment, but they cannot give an endowment   ENDENTRY in the wilderness. If we do not carry out the  plan Joseph has laid and the pattern he has given  for us to work by we cannot get any further  endowment I want it to sink deep into your heart  that you may remember it. I repeat it, let me  reason with you. If you stir up the flame of dissent  will you get an endowment No, you get a party  to run here and another there, and divide our  strength, and weaken our hands and we will be  left and our enemies will flock around us and destroy  us in that case you will not get your endowment  but will sink and not rise go to hell and not to  the bosom of Abraham. do the people leave here because they are afraid^?^ what are you Cowards,^?^  do you fear those that have power to kill the body and have no other power more than him that has  power to cast both soul and body in hell. If you  leave this place for fear of the mob before God  tells you to go you will have no place of rest  but you will flee from place to place and go  like the jews untill God raises up some other people to redeem you for if the devil scares you from this place he will scare you from  all other places. Let no man go from this place  but the pine country brethren but stay here^,^ sow  plant, build, put your plow share^s^ into the prairies one plow share will do more to drive off the mob  than two guns. let us stay here with ^where^ the bones  of Joseph and ^Don^ Carloss and father  Smith ^are^, Joseph has said if I am slain in battle or fall any way I want my body laid lain in Nauvoo I had rather have the dead body of the prophet  than some men who are alive, and I should rather  have the clothes of the prophet stuffed with straw for President ^of the US^ than any man whose name is now before the nation for a candidate for he would   ENDENTRY would not do so much harm. We want to build the Temple in this place if we have to build it as the Jews built the walls of the Temple in Jerrusalem with a sword in one hand and the trowell in the other. how easily ^some^ men are scared this child was never ^I have not been^ frightened yet and I know of other men who are ^have^ not. Do you suppose the mouth of God is closed to be opened unt  no more unto us. If this was the case I would  not give the ashes of arie straw for the salvati- ion of the Church. If God has ceased to speak By the Holy Ghost or revelation their is no salvation but this is not the case. Their seems to be a disposition by many to leave Nauvoo and  go into the wilderness or some whare els, but what if we should go into the wilderness, and we  should ask God to give us an endowment, and  he should ask if we were driven from  Nauvoo and who drove you? the devel drove us, would be the answer. well he might say did  you not know that I had power over the devil, yes but one said that I would not give a Jack  knife for all Nauvoo and another said I would  not give a pair of mules for the best farm in Hancock Co and I was afraid. would the Lord give an endowment to a people that would be fritened away from ^their^ duty.^?^ Those that are  wishing to lead away parties contrary to council  I would not wish them damned worse than to have a company after their own liking for  they will soon quarrel among themselves; and if we should go to the wilderness and  ask the Lord, to give us an endowment He might ask us saying did I not give you rock in Nauvoo to build the temple with? yes. Did I not through my   ENDENTRY providence furnish men to quirry and cut the  stone and prepare them ^it^ for the building yes did I  not give you means to build the Temple there^?^  yes. vary well had you have died in Nauvoo on the walls of the Temple or in your fields I would have taken you to glory ^myself^ and raised  up men to officiate for you and you would have got ^and enjoyed^ the highest glory. did you make a sacrafice  by tithing^?^ No well I dont wonder you did  not believe I had power over the devil. Such may go away. But I want to have the  faithful stay here to settle the city. we shall require the 10th of all your property for the ^as a^  tithing for the building of the Temples, the poor and for the Priesthood. I want my support and  living by the church hereafter so that I can  give my whole time to the business of the church I have always supported myself heretofore in all my travels and labours. While in England one  year, we circulated 60,000 tracts upon our  doctrin. this ought to be done in all the world ^and it can be where the Elders are faithful in their calling^ The testitor ^Joseph^ has always lived ^been preserved^ untill now, but he has now sealed his testimony with his blood  and his testiment should now be put in force while the testator lived it was all in his hands but now he is dead. Their is no remission of  sins without the Sheding of Blood. you will soon wake up and know things as they are their  has been a great dept paid. their will be no need  of more Blood of the Saints being shed at present by and by you will understand and see that all is right. WO, WO, WO, unto all who have shed the blood of the Saints and the Lords  Anointed it must needs be that offences come  but wo unto that man through whome they come   ENDENTRY to those that want to go away from this place I  would say wait untill the time comes. I will  give you the key. South America  is Zion and as soon as the temple is done and  you get your endowment you can go and  build up statkes but dont be in haste, wait untill  the Lord says go. If you have the spirit of  God you can discover right from wrong. when  all is right with the priesthood is right ^and^ A man is  rises up and speaks in the spirit of God and  just right All will say Amen but when  a man rises up and talks as smooth as oil  if he is not right their will be many queries  about it^,^ it will not satisfy ^edify^ the body I give  this as a key. You may go all over North  and South America and build up stakes when  the time comes. The whole continant of  America must be organized into districts  and Presiding elders appointed over each  district, the time has come when all  things must be set in order. I have had these  things upon my mind a long time. the time  has come now for bickerings to scease their there must  be a strict order of things, and we are no longer  bound to harbor black legs, counterfieters, boges  makers, we know all about them they have been  in our midst long enough. I advise all the Saints  to have no dealing with such men let them alone the time has come that they should be wiped  out of our midst, let those men alone, let the ungod- ly dealers alone. And as to the doctors who are in  our midst who are our enemies I would say let  them alone, for I have no boubt but that three  to one who have died in this place had a doctor  and I would say wo unto yo^u^ Lawyers for their ^your^   ENDENTRY whole study is to put down truth and put a lie  in its stead. I want the Lawyers to know that  we have common sens^e^ they want to make  you believe that when you spell Baker it  means cider or whiskey; Now let the Lawyers  and doctors alone and leave all ^off^ bitterness and  evil speaking alone and you will build the Temple  and get an endowment. All ye Lawyiers go  away and let us alone, and when we want you  and we ^and^ get full of the devil ^and want you^ we will send for you,  we may then have a more convenient season  but go thy way for this time, and I want to  say to all Saints do not harbor black legs coun- terfeiters, and bogas makers wipe them away it is time to carry out the design of our prophet do scease to employ doctors Lawyers and Merchants  who will empty your purs and then mob you Store your grain in Nauvoo for you will want  it here, to eat while you are bilding the Temple.  I want to say to the hands upon the Temple be  united and I want to say to the committee ^I say^  dont turn away any person because he is an  Englishman, Scotchman Irishman or any other  nation, but employ evry man you can and build  the temple and your homes. I had rather pay  out evry sent I have to build up this place  and get an endowment If I was driven the  next minute, without any thing to take with me  As to the doctors let them go. I can prove that  a doctor in this place doctored a woman that  was in the family way and did not know it  untill she was delivered, and both woman and  child died, and if you will employ them  you will all die, but the time has come   ENDENTRY when you need no longer to support  them. their is a distinction between the  law of the Land and the law of the Church  you have the privilege of keeping all shops that  does not come in contack with the Law of  the state county or city, so I will evade the law  says the dealer and give away whiskey and  sell a little tobaco or somthing and charge enough  for both, but the law of the Church will  reach such men if they are members for they  will be cut off. (I had a dream which I will  here relate I saw a fruit tree, and I went into the  tree in search of fruit. I soon discovered that some  of the main branches on ^the^ top g^r^oing from the main  body was dead; It seemed necessary to cut off  the dead branches in order to save the tree so I  told some person to help me cut them off and they  steped on to a large green limb they were afraid it  would break, so I put my sholder under it and held  it up while he cut off the dead branches it cracked  the green limb but it did not break. after we cut  off the dry limbs the wounds healed up and the  tree grew finely) now let us cut of the dead bran ches of the Church that good fruit may grow  and the voice will soon be herd go and build  Zion and the great Temple of the Lord.    A word unto the Seventies they will be organized  into their different quorums and a Presidency  of seven men will be chosen out of the first  seventy to preside over each quorum. Now as you  have been warned let evry man warn his Neighbor and we will give evry man his appointment as soon as convenient   May the Lord bless you in the name of Jesus Christ Amen ^see next page^   ENDENTRY The Saints assembled in the afternoon and  was addressed by Elder H. C.

But I  thank my God that I have this privilege of blessing  thee for my heart is full of blessings for thee, for  thou has art the greatest Mother in Israel, the  sons thou hast bourn and Cherished, are the most  noble spirits that ever graced humanity or taber- nacled in flesh. their work shall be had in honorable  rememberance through all generations of men.  Though counted among transgressors, they like the  Messiah have shed their blood for the sins of the  people, and freely offered their lives and sealed  their testimony ^with their Blood^.

I arose and  delivered them my farewell address it was short The following is a few items which I presented to the  People. Their is a spirit in man and the inspiration  of the Almighty giveth it understanding it is through  this principle that this congregation is assembled  together at this Place. you had understanding of  the things of God by the spirit of God. And I have  now one important declaration to make unto you and  that is that inasmuch as you will be united in heart  mind and action in supporting your councillors the  authority of the, church the Priesthood of God  and follow the council given you; as you have  endeavored to follow the council of the Prophet  while he was living, you will be safe and blessed  and will Prosper but if you are divided and reject  the council of God you will fall, union and faithful ness is your salvation. It is true you have been  led by one of the best men that ever has graced  humanity, or tabernacled in flesh but he has gone he has sealed his testimony with his blood. he has  loved this people unto death. But I would now call  upon this people to be united in building upon the  foundation which The Prophet Joseph has laid   ENDENTRY It is true you have been called to suffer much in  the cause in which you are engaged but if Judgment  bgins at the house of God, babylon will not escape and if their is a fire in a green tree a dry tree will  not escape the fire, and their is no people more  prepared for the shok that is coming on the earth than  than the latter day Saints, for the object we have is  to secure blessings beyound the veil in the first resurr- ection this ^is what^ we are preparing for. Again I would say  let not the saints be troubled because they have lost  their Prophet. for I would ask because the Prophet  has sealed his testimony with his Blood if that destroys  the gospel, or take^s^ away the power of God, is truth  anhilated, or has the Priesthood found a burying  place I tell you Nay it has ^does^ not, the ^His^ testiment  is now in force. therefore my council is to follow  the example of those who have gone before and  be faithful untill death, if you will be united  and go to with your mights in building that temple  you will have power to accomplish it and get an endow ment. I exhorted them to faithfulness and requested  their Prayers, asked forgiveness of any thing that  I might have done wrong and bade them farew- ell I was followed by Elder B, Young who made  many interesting remarks. Also Elders O Hyde  and Joseph the Prophet and  Seer had ordained, anointed, and appointed the  Twelve to lead the Church had given them the  Keys of the Kingdom of God for that purpose  R, Cahoon bore testimony to the  same thing, saying that Joseph said unto the  Twelve upon your sholdiers the kingdom of God must  rest in all the world, now round up your sholdiers and  bear it many important things were spoken that  I have not time to write. The brethren came forward  to convey us to Chicago when we were ready   ENDENTRY when the meeting was closed, after shaking hand  with many friends, and taking many letters to convey  to England, I returned to my family all our children  were at home.

It was the last day that I or my family  shall spend in Nauvoo for many days. I have  left my family and friends almost yearly to go  on missions in the vineyard of the Lord, for the  last ten years of my life, but have never attempted  to take my family with me before for the purpose  of accompaning me on a mission, but as I am now  about to leave my own country to again visit foreign  climes to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and take  care of the Churches which will probably be a   ENDENTRY long mission I conclude it best to take my  family with ^me^ according to the Council of the Twelve so this day is spent settleing accounts taking  inventoriey of Goods and Chatels left, packing up  goods, recieving letters, bidding friends farewell  blessing the Saints, which continued untill midnight FIGURE At 12 oclok at night in company with Mrs Wood- ruff, Br Hannah  Ells, we walked to the Temple of the Lord in  Nauvoo, and as we approached it we lifted up  our eyes and beheld the greatness grandure and  glory that presented itself to our view in a conspic- uous manner while she was covered with the silver  rays of the Queen of the night who was pouring the  whole strength of the brightness of her glory upon  her it presented an imposing, grand, and sublime  senery to the beholder, after gazing a few moments  upon her magnus walls, and examining her capitols  which were completed, standing on the ground, we  all as of one accord assended the laders unto the  top on of the walls, several of the poliece and friends  followed our example, among which was Gen C C Rich  and Elder Godard we repaired to the South west  corner of the Temple and their in company with  Mrs Woodruff and the above named brethren and sisters we bowed our knees upon the top corner stone  which was prepaired to recieve its Capitol, And their  with uplifted hands towards heaven, I called  upon the God of Abraham Isaac, Jacob and Joseph  by Prayer and supplication to except the gratitude  of our hearts for his mercies and blessings unto us in  preserving our lives giving us power to build the  Temple thus far. Prayed that the Saints might have  power to finish the Temple according to the Patern  given, and accepted at their hands, that the Saints  might recieve their endowment, and be prepared to  plant the work of God in all the world. I asked   ENDENTRY my heavenly father in the name of Jesus Christ  and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood and the  Keys of the kingdom of God that he would spedily  avenge the blood of Joseph the Prophet Seer  and Revelator, and Hiram the Patriarch, which  had been shed by the hands of the American  gentile nation, upon all the heads of the Nation and  State that have aided, abeted or perpetrated the  horid deed, of sheding the blood of those righteous  men even the Lords anointed. I prayed that  God would preserve our lives and enabled and us to fill our mission in righteousness and be  enabled to again return to this land and tread the  courts of the Lords house in peace and recieve  blessings at his hand. And that a double portion  of the spirit of Josephs God might rest upon  President Brigham Young and upon the quorum  of the Twelve in connexion with him, that  they may have power to bear off the keys of the  kingdom of God in all the world, in righteous- ness and truth according to the power of God.  and that the work of the ministry, and Power  of the Priesthood, may rest upon all the quorums of  the Church and Elders of Israel. I dedicated myself  my family, and all appertaining unto me, unto God  committing my all into his hands, for the mission  Praying for his blessing to rest upon me through  the mission appointed unto me in the name  of Jesus Christ Amen.

He spoke  of the Priesthood and said that it was a perfect  system of goverment and made many useful  remarks.   In the afternoon the conference again  met Prayr By Elder Page the meeting was addressed  by Elder Kimball, spoke in parables, gather in the  wheat and tares thrash the wheat and the mill will  blow away the chaff andc Said an Elder would  get a people together and could get the priest and  people to receive the work if they did not whip  the sect so like a shepherd who would call up a  buck and a flock of sheep and hand them a little salt  and Just as they begin to eat hit him with a club  across the head and the sheep will run away.   Elder G. A. Smith followed and bore testimony of the  work told several anecdotes one from Lyman Wight   ENDENTRY said that a man told of a story so big about his  Cheese house that a woman did not believ it and asked  a servant if it was true. He said that his master  did not let him go into the Cheese house but one thing  he new that his master had a tremendous  great Cheese house and a great mill of four run of  stone that was carryed by the whay that runs  from the Cheese house so let the Elders tel  about the whey but not about what is in the  Cheese house as long as they have not seen it  let the misteries alone and speak of things that  you understand. He spoke of his collegiate  education he received from President Joseph  Smith which was, to preach short sermans  and make short prayers which had done him  much good in life.   Elder B Young next spoke  and made some useful remarks said the scriptures  had been mistifyed to that degree that the greatest  divine of the day is as ignorant as the dumm ass  concerning the things of God they dont know their  right hand from their left and we are trying to  revere it to make it so simple that the people  can understand it. Place a man in this room  that is ignorant of science and take evry thing out  that we can see and then ask him if their is  any thing in the room, he says no nothing but we two. I tel him that there is millions of live  animals in the room even we breath them and I  will show him by the aid of glasses that their  is live animals in one drop of water eight feet long but he dont believe it untill he sees it through  glasses so with the unbeliever he does not  believe in God, in Angels, in spirits because he  cannot see them, but let him have spiritual  glasses or obey the commandments of God and   ENDENTRY get the spirit of God and then he can see and many  other usful remarks he made. A Hymn was  then sung. Then several questions were asked 1st Can any member officer in any branch  of the church say their word is law and should  be obayed (No) Is it right for an A priest to be  joined to a Teacher to go and visit the houses of  each member when their duty is set forth in  the covenants. (Yes any members that are  officers from High Priest to Deacon may visit  the church or members and be set apart for this  purpose if the Church will receive it)   2 I instruction If Elders or High Priest are  on an Island and cannot get word from the  Prophet or the Twelve they may get a revelation  concerning themselves, the Twelve may get  a revelation in any part of the world concer- ning the building up the kingdom as they have  to esstablished the kingdom in all parts of the  world, so any person can ask the Lord for a  witness concerning himself he can get an answ er to himself but not to lead the Church that  Belongs to the head of the church   3rd Can a Church make buy laws as expediences  for themselves that are not specifyed  in any revelation (yes if they wish, they may  make laws to stick their fingers in their eyes  if they wish, but it is like sticking their finger  through a not hole, in the wall to see what  custom will do   4th When any person is ordained legally  by the vote of the Church to any office can  he be releaced from that office and priesthood  (No) and hold his standing in the church (No)  Elder young made many useful remark conference adjourned untill tomorrow   ENDENTRY August 27, 1843 ~ Sunday   27th Conference met at half past 10 oclock accor ding to adjournment. meeting opened by singing Prayer by Elder Grant. Meeting was then addressed  by Elder W. Woodruff from 2nd Epistle of Peter  1st ch 20, 21 verses. He remarked that if the prophe- sies that had been fulfilled were fulfilled litterally  in kike manner would those prophesies which  are still to be fullfilled, be done litterally. And  that the gathering of the Saints, the building of  Zion, the gathering of the Jews, the rebuilding  of Jerrusalem, the esstablishing of the Church  and kingdom of God in the last days The preaching  of the gospel to all the world was is an event looked  for by the latter day Saints. and not withstanding  these things are unpopular and not looked for or  believed in by the world yet we feel incouraged  to persevere and press forward in assisting to accom- plish these great and glorious things with a firm  belief that they will as truly be brought to pass  and perfected as those things prophesied were in  ancient days. He also bore testimony of the  Truth of the Book of Mormon, covenants, and a  prophet of God.    Elder Kimball followed and  made some appropriate remarks, when the  meeting adjourned two hourse.    Elder J. E. Page  addressed the meeting in the afternoon, on the  testimony of the Book of the Book of Mormon and  that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. He quoted  to many passages in the doctrins and covenants and  Book of Mormon that prophesied of things that  should take place which had actually come to  pass according to the prophesies. He spoke quite  lengthy upon the subject and brought much  testimony to proove the truth of the position  he had taken. At the close of his discourse  some Church business was attended to as  Elder Nauvoo  It was necessary that another should be appointed  in his stead to preside in New York   ENDENTRY A vote was call to know if they ^the Church^ was perfectly  satisfyed with Elders Foster's labours and procedings  as Presiding Elder in the Church; the vote was  Unanimous. Elder Foster resigned his office and  Elder ^Geoe L Seach^ was appointed president  of the Church in New York by a vot of the same  After which several children were blessed and the  meeting adjourned untill evening; At which time  Elder O. Pratt addressed the people concerning  the Book of Mormon. He spoke in an edifying  manner concerning the Book of Mormon its  history what it was andc that it was a history of  nearly one half of the globe and the people that  inhabited it, that it gave a history of all those  cities that have been of late discoverd by Carthe- -rwood's and Stephens, that it named those cities  That it spoke of the esstablishing of our goverm- ent and what is more highly interesting it reveals  its final fate and destiny, so that by reading the  Book of mormon you can clearly see what will  befal this nation, and what will be its final end.  In that Book you will find recorded the pure  principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ as taught  by himself on the Continant of America so plain  that no two persons could disagree as to the points  of doctrin set forth, many interesting remarks  he made upon this subject then bore testimony  of the truth of Joseph Smith sen jr. being a true  Prophet of God and that the Book of Mormon was  true and that the Church of the Latter day saints  was the true church of God, and after finishing his  testimony he commenced and preached another  sermon and spoke in all a little short of two  hours, after he closed we blessed 5 children  and attended to some other duties we dismissed the  people.

P. Pratt arose and remarked that  some tell us that they have taught the gathering  according to the scriptures, but to teach the  gathering from the scriptures alone is not  sufficient for by this they would be left in  doubt they would not know whether to  gather to Jerrusalem to Africa or America. It is right to teach ^the gathering^ according to the scripturs  but we are not left to this alone, we know and  all the Saints aught to know that God has  pointed out a place and time of gathering and  has raised up a Prophet to bring it about of  which we are witnesses, we have not got to go  a long round about the time and place is pointed  out the foundations of the Templ laid  and a people already gatherd and we know to have  to go, and to reject the revelations of God that have  pointed out these things to us ownly brings condem nations, and if this is not the case then our faith  is vain and our works and hopes are vain also we have already got the opinions of men enough  concerning the coming of Jesus Christ. But  we need the voice of a Prophet in such a case  and we have it and I am willing to risk my all  upon it. And if the Elders understand the  principal of gathering and teach it correctly  the people would have the correct spirit of gathering.   E. P. Magin arose and said he made the remark  that he had made taught the gathering according  to the scriptures. But he considerd all modern  revelations scripture as well as those given  anciently. P. P. Pratt sayed they agreed  their was no disagreement andc   ENDENTRY Elder B. Young arose and said, he wished to  make a few general remarks concerning the  subject of our faith we hear the Elders  represent the feelings of the Brethren concerning  the gathering. The spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ  is a gathering spirit and the its tendency is to gather  the virtuous and good the honest and meek of the  earth, and in fine the saints of God. The time has  come when the Lord is determin to fullfill his  purpose. Had we lived in the days of Jesus Christ  we would say we would receive his work. But  Judge ye if the people are better now than then they are not. When the full set time is come  the Lord came in the flesh to do his work whether  the people were prepared or not. And now the full  set time is come for the Lord God Almighty to set  his hand to redeem Israel we are not bound to  make the people believe but to preach the gospel and  then our garments are clear. The Lord does not  require evry soul to leave his home as soon as he  believes but he requirs him to harken to council and  follow that course that the lord points out, the  spirit of the Lord and this work is on the elect, and  those that keep up with the work must be on  the alert also. When the Lord says gather  yourselves together why do you ask the Lord what  for, is it not the principle of the Saints to mingle  together to promote the great cause in which we  are engaged. Say you cannot the Lord save  us as well whare we are as to gather together. Yes  if the Lord sayes so but if he commands us to  come out and gather together, He will not save us  by staying at home. Have you not received the  gospel yes, then do you believe the gospel what  we say. Have you not received the Holy Ghost   ENDENTRY By receiving the gospel which we have brought  unto you, yes and thousands have and it stands as a  testimony that God has got a Prophet on the  earth, you might have been baptized seventy  times seven in any way except the way God had  ordained and pointed out and you would not have  received the Holy Ghost, this also is a  testimony to you. Are ye ingaged in the great  work with us ye will say yes, can ye do  any good? yes ye can. The sectarian world  send the Bible to the nations of the earth, the  people put in sixpence fifty cts or a dollar into  the box and send Bibles through the world. Then cannot we do sumthing yes, the Lord  requires us to build a house unto his name  that the ordinances and blessings of his kingdom  may be revealed and that the Elders may be  endowed and go forth and gather together the blood  of Ephraim the people of God from the ends of  the earth. Can you get an endowment in Boston No and ownly in that place that God has pointed  out. Now query could moses have got the law had  he staid in the midst of the children of Israel had  he not gone to the mountains? The Lord says  go and do so and so stand before Phario, pull off your  shoes for the ground is Holy andc. Moses obeyed  and obtained blessings, but if he had not obeyed  he would not have obtained the blessing. But why  query about it has the Lord spoken yes then  this is enough. I do not care whether the people  gather or not if they dont want to, I do not wish  to save the people against their will, I wish you  to have your choice either to gather with the  righteous or stay with the wicked, I would like  to have all people bow down to the Lord Jesus Christ  but it is one of the decrees of the Lord that all   ENDENTRY persons shall act upon their agency, which  was the case even with the angels that fell  from heaven.   Now will you help us  to build the Temple if so you  will be blessed if not we will build it alone And if you dont harken you will not have  the spirit of the Lord, for the spirit of the  Lord is on the moove. The Apostles tried to  gather the people together in their day. Christ said he  would gather the Jews oft as a hen gathereth her  chickens under her wings but they would not God and Angels dont care whether men hear or forbear they will carry on their work for the full set  time is come and we care about it we must  build a house and get an endowment and preach the  gospel, warn the people, gather the Saints, build  up Zion and finish our work and be prepared for  the Coming of Christ. Now we want to send  missionaries to the Islands can you do sumthing for them and that is not all we want you to  do we want you to give us sumthing to build  a temple we want what you have to spare.  But are you afraid that you will not have  Enough for youself when you get there. But  how easy it is for the Lord to take it away from  you by fire and otherwise. E P Magin had an ^Ivory^ cane I asked him for it but he din give it to me but  he soon lost it and it did neither of us any good But the Lord can give and take away. Jacob with  his faith obtained all the best cattle that his  Father in law had. Who blesses you and all the  people God, but do the people acknowledge the hand  of God in all these things No, they turn away  from him and do not acknowledge him or realize  from whom their blessings flow. Let me tell  you a secret when the Lord shakes the earth   ENDENTRY And the Hills fall down and vallies are exhalted  then for brass the Lord will bring gold for Iron  silver for stones Iron andc, then you will have  no use for gold, for money and gods as you now  have but the Lord will think as much of it  then as now. Let us have some of your gold  to take to Nauvoo, House so that when the Kings Princes and Nobles  of the earth call at Nauvoo to enquire after  the wisdom of Zion that they may have a place  to entertain them, and that the weary travellor may  be refreshed, is their wisdom in Zion, we  think so and the world begin to think so, let the  world come forward and translate the plates that  have of late come forth, if they have wisdom  to do it. The Lord intends to take away the gods  of the gods of the gentiles the Lord pulleth down  and buildeth up at his own pleasure dont be afraid  of a dollar a hundred or a thousand dollars I  would not I have made a sacrafice a good many  times, the Lord has promised a hundred fold and  I have taken this course to get rich, to give all  I had and God has given many blessings in consequ ence. If I have been to bold in asking, then be  to bold in giving give your all and God will repay  as much again adjurned untill half past 2 oclok   Met according to adjournment meeting opened by  singing and Prayer By Elder P. P. Pratt who arose  and said I have a few remarks to make concerning  the subject spoken of in the fornoon by Elder  B. Young who said your all we wanted all  your gold silver and precious things andc we  not ownly want your all as pertains to gold  silver andc but we want you, your wives and   ENDENTRY Children, and all you have. I dont know that  I can give you a better pattern of what we want  than the case of Joseph in Egypt. An Israel- ite will get all he can, they are vary great to  go ahead. The Egyptians believed in dreams  and by this peculiar gift Joseph entered into a great  scheme of speculation, he used the gift of dreams  to become great in the eyes of the Egyptians,  had great political influence came out on the kings  horse in great splendor, and lade up corn in great  abundance during the seven years Plenty and in time  of famine got all the gold, silver, cattle property  their own persons, this speculation was from  a Josephite and it was like an Israelite, it was  like Noah, Lot, Christ, andc and it is a fair sample of  our speculation. God is the origin of Power  the Sovreign, and he has a right to reign, and their  will be good times and goverment when the world  will acknowledge the God of heaven their lawgiver  and If I could live under his goverment I should  be thankful, then our prayer would be answered  may thy kingdom come andc untill that time we  must pray for it. This Joseph in Egypt the  speculator what a great and good man he was I love him I admire his course, and I believe a little  of his blood is in my veins. But had Joseph  been like the religious world at the present day he  would not have rode the kings horse and wore his  robe and had nothing to do with gold and silver, and do no  good, save no corn, build no store houses, do none  of these things for fear of speculation. But He done  differently. And their is a prophesy about the modern  Prophet Joseph, being raised and supported by the power  of God to do a work on the earth. And he has been  raised up and the Lord has been with him and evry   ENDENTRY formed against him has been broaken. He  has had rising of thirty law suits to pass  through and yet he has overcome and no accusation  has been susstained against him, but he will  lay a plan to speculate as large as Ancient Joseph  did, what Elder Young said is good, and even  now we want you to take that course that  will save you. Build up a city and Temples and  enjoy them and do as the Lord tells you and harken  to Council. we have a prophet to tell us what to  do, and we should get as much wisdom as the  world, if the world want a rail road built all  they have to do is to open books the people  subscribe stock and a rail road is soon built and an  income is brought. And the Saints ought to  be as well united as the world, and do the things  that God has required, that a great nation may  be saved from all Nations. The old gentleman  that rules the nations has ruled long enough  and if I was an Infidel I would like to have  the Lord raise up a Joseph or Daniel or sumbod to raise up a change for the good of the world and thank Heaven he has begun to raise them  up to do the great work of God and it will continue  untill the saying goes forth that the Lord  has built up Zion. I read that Gold, silver, power  thrones and dominions will be connected with the  great work of God in the last days, then let us  wake up and enlarge our hearts and prepare for  the great and glorious work, does the Saints here  in Boston know that they are Identifyed  with laying the foundation of a great and mighty  work that is to enclude all the great and  glorious work that is to be fulfilled in the last  dispensation and fulness of times And   ENDENTRY And I Prophecy in the name of the Lord  that whether Boston Saints or who may stand  for it or rise against it that almost numberless  milions will selebrate that day when the founda- tion of this work was laid.   G A Smith arose and said that he was pleased  with the many remarks that had been made  this day you can see a similarity between the  two Josephs and the Laws that were given. Says  one who believes that God who dwells in heaven  will speak about building a house andc in this day  of religion and science. But the day was when the salv- ation or damnation of a whole world hung upon  a small circumstance even in the days of Noah the  building of an ark, had the Editors of this day  lived then I think they would have said and  written more against it than they have against  Joseph Smiths Revelations. You talk about God  condesending to speak of small things in the last  days but no more so than it was in the days  of Moses for we read in the bible how God comm- anded the Children of Israel when they found  a birds nest to take the young to themselves but  to let the dam go free, what for, wy that their  days might de be long in the land which their God the  Lord their God giveth them, so come to the point  it was a great thing at last. Yet connecting this with  the word of the Lord concerning eating beetles and  grashoppers was as small business for the Lord to  talk about as it was for the Lord to command  the Saints to build a tavern. This boarding  house when done will do much good for  the spreading of the work to all nations. But  what good could arise from eating beetles and grasshopers  I cannot say   ENDENTRY Same Day.

It contains many interesting items  of history, but their is one trait in it the same as in  evry history published since the days of Christ and  the Apostles, (except what has been published by the latter Day Saints) ie they are all alike robbed of apostolic purity  religion, order, ordinances, Holy Ghost, gifts, grace, miricles Prophets Revelations, all of one accord cry out these  things are done away, but they are ownly done away  through their unbelief, making void the law of God  changing the ordinances breaking the everlasting  covenant departing from the apostolic order of things)    we sailed well through the day and night Mrs Woodruff made a request which is to be granted  within three years {which is to have} 2 {sons} In the morning we came in sight of the Manatau Islands    ENDENTRY September 13, 1844 ~Friday   13th fair breeze sail well Arived at the Manatau Islands at 12 oclok spent three hours there I walked  over the beach with Mrs Woodruff the same  ground that we walked over after being wrecked  on the Chesapeak in Sept 1841 it brought the scene  fresh to mind.

I caught a bucket about half full of water and run as I was barefoot to the stern of the boat looking for the fire while some was runing up stares I leaped into the engine room   ENDENTRY And saw the fire in one cornor of the stern of the  boat I run over the pile of coal and dashed my water into the fire which was not larger than  a half bushel measure, at the same time a bucket of  water flung by Capt Davis struck the fire and it was  instantly extinguished; Their is nothing more terrible or  alarming than the cry of fire on board of a ship or  steem boat at Sea or on any water out of reach of Land, it is far more terrible than a storm or  wreck, for when fire gets the control under such  circumstances all hope is lost, and persons will plunge  into the deep to escape its fury. but in this case the  fire was out and the alarm over in the term of a  minute. on my return to the cabin I found one woman flung into convulsions with alarm.
