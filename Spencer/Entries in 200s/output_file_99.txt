I must offer an appoligy for not writi-  ng to you befor; but I have ben verry  buissy & have not ben able write  once around yet. I have just return-  ed from evening meeting of the Saints  of Oldham in the temperance hall, we had  a very good meeting; but there were  no strangers present. I am laboring  with bro Holt, at present in the Oldham  district. This district includes Hayfield  Stockport Stalybridge Ashton Oldham Shaw  Roachdale and Middleton. Bro Holt has had  a good deal of experiance in the missionary  field and is well qualified to give me some  good training. Says he was converted to  the truth by a sermon that you preached 
 and not yet returned; but the family  of Saints(?) where he stays when in  Portsmouth allowed me to stay over  night I have got out of the firepan  into the fire this time sure! There  are a very few Saints in this distr-  ict and very poor ones at that with   one or two exceptions. A great many   of the Saints in this country are  so weak in the faith that it takes  one man on ea side of them with  an umberella to keep them in the  church now that they are in, and  we have to guard every action and  world and almost our very thoughts  for fear of offending some of them,  but they are not at all particular  what kind of language they use to  us; but I am like the Drummer  that gets kicked down stairs and   has doors slamed in his face, I never  [g]et insulted.

You have heard ere this I  suppose concering my experiance at sea, one  thing I forgot to mention, was that we passed  through a large school of Whales on the trip 
 was thoroughly enjoyed. I of course  added my mite to the evenings  entertainment. After the exercises  were over, games of a sociable char-  acter were indulged ^in^ by the local  Saints; we Elders however did not  take part in them for obvious  reasons, but taking it all togather  we had a very enjoyable time. I went   through the Manchester Art Gallery  a few days ago where several thou-  sand specimens are on exhibitions  nearly all the leading artists in the  country are there represented. The  finest picture of the collection in  my estimation is one called "Dantes  Dream," it measures about 12 x 14 ft  and is valued at $5,000.

 but I doubt very much whether their son's  went without a good long purse. Of course  I believe if an Elder is in a tight place the  Lord will provide for him, in fact He  has provided for me although I had plenty  of money in my pocket. Ask Wm Wagstaff  what he thinks of the British mission  to day and what it cost him. I think I  am perfectly safe in saying that I have  spent as little as any one in the field. I never  ride only when I am compelled to through  force of circumstances for I would just  as soon walk throu 12 miles through this  beautiful scenery as not. I would not be   a Woodruff if I would not. No Father  I have not spent $20.00 a month nor  $500 a month out side of clothing, so  I have plenty money for a long time,  yet with care, and I was greatly surprized  when I rec'd the draft, but I can take  care of it for future need. I would not  mention what bro Smith said to me, it might  cause jealousey. Dont send any more money  or mention it until I ask for it which wont  be for some time. Your affectionate Son, Asahel.

At Ecles a few  nights ago we were holding a meeting  when bro Allen finished speaking the  crowd—which had ben warming up  at the rate of about one degree pr  minute—was just about at boiling  point; they said I must not occupy  over 30 minutes, but as they were not   running the meeting I determined to   speak as long as the Spirit prompted  me to, however at the expiration of  half an hour the one big burly fellow  with a club in his hand and an exager-  ated hat on his head who had boiled  over the rim of the rabble pot enterd the  ring in which I was standing and walk  up to my side, thinking perhaps that his  very appearance would strike terror to  my heart and cause me to flee but I  did not feel the least bit like running  on the contrary I felt quite at home so  I just turned the battery on him and  shouted into his ear, he stood it for

Have you ever ben  to Portsmouth?  If so you will perhaps  remember that it is built on the   island of Port-Sea and that the port  nearest the mainland is composed of  rather unpretetious buildings while  along the sea beach next the Isle  of Wight are to be found some splendid  hotels as well as private mansions et[c.]  I had the privilige yeasterday of seeing  several Men-of-War lying in the harbor  among the number was the Victory  on which Lord Nelson lost his life

Had a pretty rough sea the  second day before landing, it was verry  dificult to keep our feet on deck, at the approach  ch of an extra high sea, the passengers would   grab something for an anchor, & those who   failed to do so were hurled with less ceremony  than dispatch against the railing or bulwarks.  It was laughable to see five or six big fellows  rolled against the side and after befor they could  regain their feet back to the other; but we took  it all in good part & as the captain said the  stronger the wind blew, the biger noise the bay  made. It was as good as a concert at table  during the rough sea cups & saucers sugar  & pickles & all salts of eatables got mixed up  in a incongruous mass untill it was dificult  to tell what we were eating. Weel Father I enjo-  yed my trip very much; but when I struck  Liverpool a cold chill ran through me, and  I felt as if I wanted to go home again; but  that feeling is leaving me by degrees as I get  better acquainted with the people, their customs 
 on a visite in South Wales amo-  ngst his rellatives and not yet  returned; so it was decided at our  last council meeting that Elder  Fowers should labor with Elder  Allen in the Tilsley district until  Pres. W.'s return at least. This arrangement  leaves me to travle alone in the   Leek district for the present at any  rate, but I dont mind it so much  because there are some places  where the people are so poor that  they are scarcely able to accomodate  two but that can get along with all  very nicely, so we see as the old say-  ing goes there is no great looss  without some small gain. Of course  I miss at times a companion to talk  to and feel a little lonely in consequence.  Still I would just about as soon be  alone. The days are getting so short  and the weather so chilley that we  think it adviseable to discontinue 
 labors with unabating interest & and every  evening that the weather will permit of our  voices may be heard reverberant through  the quiet country viliages after the weary  farmer has repaired from his wearisom  tail to seek repose beneath his humbel  roof or perhaps to loiter at a side road  inn or they may be lost in the never  ceasing din of the larger towns & cities.  I have not as yet had the pleasure of  baptizing any one, but we have succed  in allaying considerable prejudice  which has existed through here for  lack of correct information on the  subject. I dont intend with the Lords  help to become discouraged, and it shall  not be throug lack of dilligence on my  part if my efforts are not crowned  with success I do not believe it is the  Elder that does the most baptizing alw-  ays that is the most faithful worker  on the contrary in my opinion it is the [worker]  for he may be sent as I have in Coy  a new district comparatively and while  no doubt there are some who are can-

The work goes on very  slowley in the best districts and  in some places it seems to be  closeing up altogather, but while the  work is closeing up in England it   is opening up in other places, as for  instance in Belfast & environs-north  of Ireland there have ben thirty bapt-  isms during the summer and the  Elders laboring in that part think  there are good prospects of adding  many more to the fold, if the efforts  of the Elders be maintained. The Elders  in the conference are all enjoying  pretty good health, the same may be  said of all in the mission so far  as I know. Am glad to heare that  Leslie feels contented.

I have just   returned from sister Chambers  who lives in another part of the  tow[n]. God has certainly blessed me  with a few godod friends to admin-  ister to my wants and this kind   Sister is one of them; although  I have only known her for a  little over a month it seems that  I must have known her for 
 4  and habits. You ask me how I like sea sick-  ness; well a little goes a long ways. I think  England a verry pretty country & if they had our  atmosphere so pure & healthfull with about  one fourth the present population and they  about 400 years more modern in their  habits (for they are about that far behind the americans)  I would like to live here, but as they are to day  if I was offerd one half the Island it would be  no inducement. Of course this is an exageration  but I am not in love with the country.    Preaching is up hill work for me I fear it  is not my forte, still I keep pegging away and  may accomplish something in two years. We   have not had any rain for three weeks, the  people tell me they dont remember a time when  the rain held of so long at once. I learn from  from the papers you are having high watters   at home, well I expected as much considering  the vast amount of snow there was in the  mountains I wrote a letter to mother the other  day in answer to one I recieved from her, trust  she got it all right. I see by the paper that  Welcome is again sentenced to be shot 
 vinced of the truth yet it takes them  some time to muster up courage to  embrace it. It is now as in days of old,  "Paul may plant, Apollos may water, but God  giveth the increase" I do not want you to  misconstrue my meaning that the district  we are in is a new one entire, but there are  several places we have ben to of the old  beaten tract which the elders have not  visited for many years and one place (Hulmes  C Chappel) they had never heard the mormons   preach. The day I posted my last letter to you  we preached at Crew a large R. R. centre from  which place a person can be booked to any  part of the United Kingdom; the elders have  not preached there since twenty years ago,  when on one occasion at the baptism of  some people one woman was accidentily drowned  since which time the sound of the gospel  has ceased to be heard there. But this is  what I want to tell you when we entered  ^who meets little success so far as the  number of baptism is concerned that  in many instances does the most good^  the town I felt verry downcast & the verry 
 questions on the principles of which  I had spoken and I would endeavor  to answer them to their entire  satisfaction, but no one raised a  dissenting voice, so I extricated  myself from the crowd and made  my way to the depot feeling thankful  to the Lord that he had strengthened   me with his Holy Spirit so that I might  warn the people. If I did no other  good I am satisfied I succeded in  allaying any prejudice that might have  ben exisitng there. I made the acquaint-  ance of a gentleman on the train and  preached to him as we sped along  over the rails, arrived at Mattram  station all ok and repaired to a Saints  house near by where I passed the night  retiring well satisfied with my days   work conscious of having done my   duty. I send Bro Day's bro a Deseret news  now and then. I am preserving all the  letters I rec. I was much pleased with  your's and Mothers letters. Give kind love  to all the family and friends. Asahel. 
 any thing if I could see the fruits of my  labors in return. But if there are many  more converts made in this country it   will have to be through some special  effort of the Almight, for the country is  being continualy flooded with misrepres-  entation about us as a people. Anti Morm  lecturers are doing their utmoast to  poison the public mind and close halls  and ears against us and this they have  succeded in doing very effectualy, for  the mere mention of Latter Day Saint  or "Mormon" has about the same  effect on them as the shaking of a red  blanket has on a wild bull.

Was glad to heare you  are well with the exception of a cold which  I trust will soon leave. You seem to have  had several quite exciting episods in your  travels north. Am glad to hear of the marriage  of Bro M F Cowley and Miss Lydia Hyde of Hyde  Park. I was afraid Matt would go of[f] tlo Calcutta  without getting himself a matrimonial mate  and am therefore somewhat surprized to hear  to the contrariry I also read of the marriage  of two other couples the bridegrooms are two  of Pres Taylors Sons and the brides are misss  Campbell and Colebrook, was acquainted with  all the party and wish them much joy on  thier journey in the matrimonal car. We are  at present in Audley a small town in  Staffordshire about 35 miles south of Mancheter  I will give you a little account of my labors  for the past ten days At our last fast 
 air of the place seemed to be full of a dread-  fuly oppressive influence, this feeling seemed  to increase more & more & when I was speaking  the ground under my feet seemed to rise &  fall and around us there was a wall of thin  bluish vapor quite perceptible. I did not mention  my feelings to my companion until after the  meeting for fear he would think I was getting  the blues; but on acquainting him with my  feelings I found that he was undergoing a  similar experiance. I am satisfied it was the  two powers of light & darkness striving for  the supremacy that caused sutch a feeling  at our meeting; as soon as we left the place  on the following morning the feeling left  us. That place is the Devels own stronghold  & he & his imps have full possession. We  are going there again this week, and I hope I  shall not have the same experiance for it  is a terrible feeling.

Your last  letter was quite as welcome as its  predecessor and I was pleased to learn  that your health was so good as I  feared your health would be impared  by the continual hardships necessarily  attending you ^present^ career.

It was quite a lengthy article and would  be easily palmed of a credulous  bublic [public] as the truth.

I wrote you quite a  long letter last Monday from Winchester  and directed as instructed to Jas G Bleak  which I hope you will get all right. I  also wrote to you on the 3rd, I think  of February.

We occasionaly have a  midnight encounter with an army of flees  and other varmine which sometimes lastsy  until daylight when we can retreat leaving  them in possession of the field. but we are   getting used to them so they dont bother  us a great deal Elder Allen is a young man  from Mount Pleasant of my own age and is  verry zealous in the cause of truth. I like  him verry much for a companion. After  haveing ben admonished by our worthy  President both by example and precept to  stir the country up with some out door  preaching, we started out on the morning  of the eleventh intending to do so if the  Lord was willing, we walked 20 miles to  a town called Macclesfield, on our arrival  we found a large multitude gatherd on

I   wrote to you and Mother on the  receipt of your last letters on the 13 inst  I think. Have not heard from any of  you since but I expect there is some  mail in Manchester for me. I will  be there on the 31st and will get it if  there is any. I am very anxious to get  the last papers to see the names of those  who have ben called on missions and  anticipate seeing the names of some of  my companions and acquaintances on  the list. Presume they will arrive in  Liverpool along early in [have] conference.  I have not heard from Henry and Nellie  in a long time. I wrote a very long  letter to them a few nights ago, suppose  they are so buisy is the reason they   do not write. Saw an extract from

While there I succeded in getting  one family interested in the Gospel  and at the jentlemans request visited  his home one evening and spent  several hours in conversation with  his wife and children; two persons  lodging with him were also present  they listened attentively and expressed  their appreciation of the principles  and admitted them to be scriptural  The man at whos instance I visited  the home I believe to be an honest  seeker after truth, and if some  unforseen circumstance does not  arrise to change his belief in the  Gospel, it is my deliberate belief that  he will in the near future cast in  his good name and fortunes with thos  of the much persecuted and missrepr-  esented Later-Day Saints.

It  is very often the case that people  look with envy upon those men  who act as embassadors for a temporal  governments, sutch as the US Minister  to England, but I look upon it as  a much greater honor to represent  to the kingdom of God and "I would   not exchange my station for the  thone of England's Queen" There is  qute a bitter feeling manifested here  betwen the Catholics and Protesta-  nts it is amusing as well as  significant to hear them impu-  gning ea[ch] other's religon, and waring  jaring Christianity is truly a spectacle 
 I think we paid rather dear for  the whistle. We would go to the door  and start up a song sometimes  singing three or four at one place.  Generaly the inmates would invite   us in and prepare some bread & butter  with tea cocoa etc, and then after   a few moments rest we were of to  the next place. I presume we  must have walked between fifteen   and twenty miles. Rather a peculiar way of enjoying ones self was it  not? On Christmas I attend a tea  party at Burry where I enjoyed  myself very well. After the party  Pres Williams and I returned to   Manchester where in company with  a policeman (one of our members)  we enterd some of the slums   of the city where it would have ben  dangerous to go alone or without  a compitent guide as we were 
 and law-abiding citizens that they are,  and I sometimes wish that while on  my mission I could be cut off from all  communication with home for there  seems to be one trouble after another  untill it keeps me in a disturbed stat  of mind almost continuely, but I am getting  what you might call case-hardened so  that all news good or bad makes but  little impression on me; and as you  say it is better to look on the bright  side of everything, and dark indeed  must be the mountain that has no  bright side to it. This is no doubt a  time of trial for the Saints and when  the storm of persecution has cleared  away the bright beams will reveal  to those sturdy saints who still remain  on the good ship Zion that some of  her weak ones have lost their holds 
 a public square called park green waiting  for the Salvatidan Army to come along  (Every one has gone mad over this army here)  but as we were more interested in the crowd  than the army, we walked into the centre  of the square where we packed stacked our  coats & satchels up in a heap and soon the  air was ringing with awake! awake the world  from sleeping. After singing Elder Allen  laid before our auditors the first principles  of the gospel in a clear and convincing manner  I closed on the apostacy & restoration and  bore testimony to the divine mission of  the prophet Joseph, we had but one interrup-  -tion which was made by a Methodist preacher  but it did not ammount to any thing  After cloosing we distributed a number of trac[t]  which were sought verry eagerly. The 12th we  walked to Cangleton eight miles and held  openair service there among our auditors  were two ministers, it is verry easy to  pick them out of a crowd as they are the   only ones who weare slouch hats a right  which they seem to reserve to themselves,  on the 13th we walked 11 miles to Leek where

It takes two hours & a half every  day to wind the clock. Father you ask what  caused that feeling to come over me when  I landed and in reply I will say it was not  caused by the remarks of any one, but when  I looked upon that vast motly crowd of  peopled & almost dispaired of being able to  successfuly combat with the flesh, the Wourld  & the Devil, but thank the Lord I have succeded  so far, and while I am not & never expect to  be a florid speaker I can give a fair enun-  ciation of the first principles (Dear Father I  am proud that you take a kindly interest  in one who is near & dear to me for she   is a good girl).

 your letter to bro Smith correcting  some errors in a former coversa-  ation, in the last number of the Star  I was much pleased with the last  letters which I received from you and  Mother, I have read them to nearly all  the Saints in my district when gatherd  around the fireside at night to let  them see what kind of Parents I have,  for I think that a letter is the best  index to a persons character that we  can possibly have; have also read  parts of them to a few Strangers, they  one and all have expressed ^their^ admiration  of them. I suppose you will both pardon  this liberty. I do so wish I had some   family portraits with me, they would  not only prove a source of comfort  to me but serve also to entertain  strangers many times. Some strangers  who have heard soo many absurd  and bloodcurdling storries as Mrs.  Paddock and writers of her class have  industriously circulated about the

Elder Chas Denney  my late companion has ben released  to return home with the company  of Saints sailing April the 11th; he has   gone to London to spend the remainder  of his time with his rellatives there  so I am left once more to prosecute  my labors afoot and alone; but this  is to me rather a source of satisfaction

This is a queer climate only  last Sunday the heat was so oppresive it  was almost impossible to get a breath of fresh  air, while the past few days it has ben  quite chilley making a place near the glowing   hearth the most desirable place when night comes  on.

I have always  had a desire to help myself so as not  to be a burden on my hard-working parents   and you have given me ^every^ encouragement.

On the 17 after bidding the   folks good by where we had ben staying, we  were soon on our way for Tean. Leaving the  turnpike to our right and taking a field road  we soon found ourselves in a beautiful little  valley through which the Churnet river flows  following its bank down for some ten miles  we passed through some of the most lovely  scenery it is I ever saw.

If you have a photograph of yourself  or any member of the family to spare  I wish you would be kind enough  to send them to me.

Denney is of sutch  a whimsicle nature that he and I could  never agree, he had no disposition to  study and considered me very unsoci-  able because I was so disposed and he  was alltogether to aggressive for there  to be any affinity existing between us.  and while we were together I traveled  alone so far as it was practicable for  the advancement of the work. So you see  I am much better of alone under the   circumstances. I have received an  invitation from the Rev A C Cooper  of Tiverton Devonshire to pay him a  visite; says that he used to have a chapple  at Evanston--I think--and that ^you^ preached in   it on several occasions.

You  are right I can always find time to read your  letters if not to answer all of them. I am  begining to come to the conclusion that  I must not say anything in my letters  but what the whole world might read for  it seems that you are letting every one read  them that you come in contact with. I am  not affraid but what they are truthful reports  of my labors— for I always mean to tell the truth—  but I am not fond enough of notariety to   to have my name arrayed before the public  either through the columns of the "news" or in

Pres Williams is a man  that does not believe in wasting   any time around rail way stations  so on this, as on other occasions,  he timed us to within two or three  minutes and did not reckon on   our having to carry a trunk weigh-  ing over 50 lbs so when we got  there it was time for the train to   start, the baggage car was closed  and I had my ticket to get. But the   guard got my trunk in all right and  ^I^ got a seat just as the train was   moving out, but there was some  some lively work done to accom-  plish it you ymay depend upon it.  On examining my ticket I found  it was for St. Pancre's Station  instead of Victoria as it should  be, so when I got in to the first  station in London I had to change  cars. From here I was whirled

Well we started   our meeting up expecting to walk afterwards  seven miles to the nearest stopping place,  so judge of our surprize when at the close a  lady came up and asked us where we were going  to stay for the night and on our telling her   we had no place in the town to stay she  invited us to go to supper with her 
 brilliancy of the most modern  art and taste. Turning, to make  the contrast more striking, by  looking at the windows and rude  carvings of the houses opposite,  we see a banister or handrail  separates the side-walk from the   carriage way, and are astonished  in steping out to it, to find the  street is some ten feet below us.  We are evidently on the second  floor of the houses. Finding steps  leading down, we descend into the  streets, and discover another tier  of shops, on the roofs of which   we have ben walking." The streets  are most of them excevated out  of the solid rock on which the   town is built.

It was  a rabit pie that we attacted in so ruthless a manner; not so much as  a hair escaped to tell of the awful destruction which took place within  hearing of at least one hundred people.

Well Father it is now  nearly six long months since I boarded the north bound train in the  Utah Central Depot and saw the vanishing farm of my dear mother as  the train moved out. Somtimes it seems sutch a very long time and at   others but a few days and I feel quite encouraged when I reflect that  nearly one quarter of the time has passed away. It is as bro Lanbert said the  other day—much harder in the British mission to day, than it was years  ago when you could go out and hold a meeting and have two or more  come up afterwards and request baptism, then the Elders had something  to stimulate them something to encourage them. but now we can travel  the country from one end to the other and preach from daylight till dark  and all the encouragement we get is the scoffs, scorns and contumely of  and ungratful generation, or else our words fall like water on a ducks

The green hills and  verdant meadows coverd with the  fir and yew trees and a variety of  evergreen shrubs together with the  ivy coverd cottages that one frequently  sees in passing through the rural  districts in the South of England, gives  every thing the appearance of Spring  rather than of Winter; and were it  not for the few varites of desciduous  trees which abound in this region   sutch as the oak, elm etc, it would   be difficult to define the seasons.

I called on bro  Day's Mr John  H. Day. I knew him the moment my   eyes fell on him owing to the striking   resemblance existing between him and  his bro.

I think there will be no  difficulty about getting their consent to our marrage   providing we remain silent on this point; but the  moment this subject should be mentioned the   whale fat would be in the fire, and they would  use all the influence they could to prevent her  becoming my wife. Under these circumstances we  have thought that the only course left open  for us, is to defer the baptism untill after marriage  when she will be baptized and as soon as we  can get recomends go throught the temple. This  in brief is a clear statement of the situation  I sometimes wish that we had remained as  we were; and had I have followed my own  judgment in the matter instead of listening to  the persuasions of others, I would not now be  confronted with this vexatious situation.

When I think about his going  home it makes me feel home sick and  I almost wish I was going with him,  but then I shall have to exercise patience  for awhile and my turn will come some  day. I only hope my health will continue  good so that I may be able to fullfil an  honerable mission & then when my release  does come I can look back with satisfact-  ion on my labors, and will feel well repaid  for my time and for the hardships endured  The most dangerous thing I have to encou-  nter is this changing from one bed to an-  other, sometimes meeting with damp bedding  which is verry injureous to health.

I am very sorry  that my letter should have ben the  means of causing you to take steps to  secure my release against your own  desires, and now you say you would   prefer to have me stay till spring, but  it is my impression that you do so   simply because you are laboring under the  belief that I would prefer to remain.

They seemed much impressed  with this solemn declaration but did  not offer a poor Mormon Elder either  food or shelter so he had to tramp  back to Grays feeling thankfull that he had  had the opportunity of warning a few more  of the decree that has gone forth.

Bro Wells introduced me to   Mr Majers, who happened to be present,  of the company of Majors, Wardell and  Russell, old freighters across the plains  in the days of the Buchanan war.

 One interesting feature of the discussion  was that one being a Baptist and another  a methodist they got into a controversey  over the mode of baptism one holding  that it should be by immerson if at  all and the other maintained that it  should be by sprinkling, but neither one  would recognize the fact that it was  indespensibily neccessary to salvation  and rather favored the idea that we   could be saved just as well without  this ordinance. I am going to hold  another meeting to night and intend  to keep it up every night so long as  the weather will permit & my lungs  hold out. I enjoy no meeting so well  as when standing alone in the midst  of strangers with no one to lean upon  but my God and I know that he and one  man or even a boy form a great majority  for "thruth is mighty (if there be but one to  proclaim it) and will prevail."

I had ben up  to London for about a week and was  returning to my field, on my arrival at the   station I found the train waiting and  proceding at once to the ticket office I  laid down a sovereign receiving my  ticket and some change in return which  I thrust into my pocket being in a hurry  without counting and thought no more  about it untill this morning, when on   examination I find that I am ten shillings  short in the change. The ticket agent evidently  took the coin for a half-sovereign and g[ave]  me change for that ammount—conference held  for a sovereign. This is quiet for no conf  when, and the

Garner to pack up his   luggage. There were only about twelve  left the London conference this time  and no doubt the company was a small  one, but I have not heard yet. Pres Penrose  accompanied those from London to  L-pool and attended conference in  Wales last Sunday. At a conference held  in Sheffield a few Sundays ago our  bretheren had a very rough time of it,  there being several attempts made to  brake up their meetings by a famous  or rather in-famous anti-Mormon preacher  by the name of Jarman and a large  number of coleagues.

The reason for my signing myself your  unworthy son was because I felt self condemed for not   having had more determination than to give way to sutch  gloomy feelings and be found complaining of my lot, no matter  how hard and unpleasant, when I thought of how nobely  you had carved your way through the obsticles suet in

A Mrs.  Woodford was over visiting when I   went, but Aunt Lin (everyone calls her  by this name here) invited her to go  home and call another day, as she wanted  to devote this one to me. I  discovered this frank manner about   her in several ways before the day  was over. She was thoughtful enough  to enquire if I was hungry, & I gave  her to understand most emphaticaly  that I was having partaken of break-  fast earley, yeasterday. She soon  had prepared some delicious butter  toast beef steak & coffee & it did taste  fine after my long ride. Breakfast  over Mr Hatch hitched Charlie into  the cutter.

The family of Saints with whom I am  staying while in Portsmouth have given  me notice that I must get a room for  my bed somewherelse in consequence  of a prospective increase in the family  which will necessitate their providing  another bed. I dont know at present where  I can go unless I hire a room amongst  strangers and I dont want to do that  if it can be avoided, none of the Saints  in the branch are in a position to spare  a room, but I suppose the Lord will open  up a place somewere. It requres a good bit  of money to travel in England now  for if you sleep under a haystack you  are almost sure to catch a cold and perhaps  get run in for vagrancy, and if you have  no money to buy food with you may go 
 Death and distruction throughout  the land, those meetingings held in  the city have ben held in mile-end-  road and by St. Pancris Rail Way Stati^on^  and have ben well attended and as  a rule orderly with the exception that  occasionly a Reverend who fears that  his craft is in danger has a put in  but as his defense consists for the  most part in spleen he is soon  defeated in the eys of the intelligent  part of our hearers.

It is early in the morning now and  every thing is as still almost as the grave, and were  it not for the stillness being occasionly broken by the  incomprehensible shouts of a costermonger or the  shrill crys of the news boy we might imagine ourselves  far removed from the din and conflusion of smoky  London. This is, in fact, a very quiet neighborhood as  a rule being situated some distance above Milbank  Prison a few hundred yards wide of the Thames  At night time however it is infested by a good many  fas woman of the most fashionable type as a great  many of them reside in this neighborhood, but they seldom  molest me; I suppose it is because I go along about  my busines and let them alone. I have recieved  letters from you baring dates April 17th, 21st & 30 also May  5th 11th and 17th but have not ben able to answer them all  through not having the time at my disposal, having  to attend as many as nine meetings in one week and  seldom getting to bed before twelve or one oclock and  sometimes later. In addition to meetings I am tracting  in the daytime and spending my spare evenings at  some strangers house when I can get the opportun^ity^  I may have ommited sometimes to state what letters  I have received from you not having them with  me, but do not think any have ben lost. The letter 
 turned gray and you would not  convince them to the contrary, and  indeed the time has fully arrived that  was spoken of by Isiah when he said  that darkness should cover the earth  and gross darkness the minds of the  people; they have heaped to themselves  teachers having itching ears who have  turned away their ears from the  truth and they have ben led astray  after fables. I am still holding a  good many open air meetings but  thus far to all humane appearances  with but little if any success. Still  I realize that it is my imperative  duty to warn the people and that  it will be woe unto me if I preach  not the gospel, if it were not so   I should not be so often seen and   heard in the streets proclaiming  that glad tidings of great joy; for  realy there is no joy no satisfaction  in preaching to sutch an indiferent 
 squad of policeman. Bro Wells did  not venture out to the evening meeting  as he for some reason, appeared to  be the pincaple object of their hatred.  One of the elders at L-pool is collec  ting the portraits of all the elders in  the mission for the purpose of send-  ing to Copenhagen to have them all  arranged on one card, each conference  to be classed by it self, and will be a  very nice thing when completed at a cost  of 18 pence each. I am still doing some  preaching in the open air and distributing  tracts at the houses, but the prospects  for converts areis vary a secure gi[ven]. Rejection  is to commonplace to be attractive and  I think if there is one place more than  another on this little earth of ours where   the people are in the dark in regard  to religous matters it is here in Grays.  Notwithstanding there is a chapel in nearly  every street. After a long dry spell we were  favored this morning with a regular old  fashioned English rain. Well I must say   good by once more, Your loving Son A H Woodruff 
 a pleasant time though there were but few there  Naomi & I went down to our corn patch last night  and pulled about ten bushels of corn in  the ear  which she is going to dry for winter so if the  worst comes we will have corn & bread to eat this  winter.  Wheat is now quoted at 35 cents per bushel   & potatoes @ 20 cents. None of the banks have suspended  though thing avalible cash is growing beautifuly less  day by day. Business here in the store is gradualy  drying up, people confining thin purchases to the  bare necessities, which leaves everything not strictly  staple on our hands,. People feel a littel more hopeful  however owing to the improved tone in eastern  markets. A house in East Waterlow just South of  S. W. Sears was burnt to the ground on Monday  night, origin unknown, but supposed to be incendiary.  A row of houses belonging to Wm Butterworth of the  Sixth ward was destroyed by fire the same night  Tramps are becoming very numberous in our neighbor-  hood lately. Two called the other evening when Owen was  away & told the girl if she did not give them something  to eat they would call again after dark. Owen & Will started  after them but they succeded in hiding away in the fields &  we have not heard from them since & dont expect to. Henry  & Nellie started for Ashley Monday noon.

 your pathway through life. The report about my coming  home refered to by Nellie in her letter was to the effect that  a number of the young men were to be sent home this   fall to make room for a certain class of missionaries  which are known here as gentile missionaries in conse  quence as it is in consequences of the gentile incluence  being brought to bare upon them that we are favored with  their presence in this country, but I disremember having said  anything farther from which she might infeer that I was  expecting to return home this fall. Nevertheless I am quite  agreeable to come home and help take care of mother and   family and do what I can to assist in your matters there  Your letter addressed to Bro. Jones arrived safely   and was handed to Pres. Penrose ^who^ considered your  proposition as proper under the circumstances and sent  it forward to Pres. Wells with recomendations for my release  So no doubt I shall return with the next and last  company, which will leave Liverpool on Oct the 24th So  I will abandon the contemplated trip on the continent  If there is any matter you would like me to attend to on  commodity, book or any article you would desire me   to bring home with me ^(I should like to know).^ I shall be in London a few days  to attend to Bro. Jones work in the office as he intends going  into the country for a few days. We are having pleasant  weather.

WILLIAM TAYLOR, PROPRIETOR    entered this sacred spot, proceding   up the centre walk we soon found  Great-Grand Father & Grand Mother Woodruff's  resting places with the toomb stones  faceing West. I recognized them in a   moment from the photos which you   have of them. It would be difficult to   describe the feeling which came over  me as I gazed upon this halowed resting  places of my long since departed kindred  & thought that perhaps you had stood  on the same spot many years before.  It may have been the cold that caused  my eys to moisten. this is a delightful  spot at sutch as one could wish to rest  in till called forth to a brighter existence  an iron fence surrounds the yard  & a row of splendid pine's cast their  approving shadows upon this matchless  home of the dead. With slow steps  (over) 
 hungry till a Saints house is reached and   then in many instances the food provided is  only sufficient to sharpen ones appetite. But  dear father dont think that I wish to complain  far from it, for I am enjoying my labors  as well as could be expected with sutch  discourageing success and the unsettled  conditions of things at home. There are  about forty members in this district all  told but about one half of them are on  the fence and the other half are scatterd  from Dan to Barsheba. The Queen came to  Portsmouth last night and went on board  her yacht. She leavs for Germany this morning  The approaches to the Dock Yard were lined with  anxious spectators eager to get a glimpse of her  majesty (myself among the number) through the car  window as her train passed by and a sigh  of disapointment ascended from the throng  when after waiting for more than 30 minutes She  passed by in a closed carriage, and baffled  and crestfallen the crowd dispersed. Consider-  able excitement prevails here in millitary  circles owing to the crittical conditions of things  on the Afghan frontier. Englishmen are confident  of their ability to give the Russian Bear another  thrashing if necessary and the seem eager  for the fray.

 going to change my field of labor  again, but sutch is realy the case.  My duties in the Whitechapple branch  are more that I can bare up und-  er and if followd up would land  me in the insane asylum or some  other charitable institution. My pbrain  has become so feverish with the  continual strain upon it that I  scarcely now what a moments peace  of mind is, so this morning I went  and laid my case before Pres. Penrose  and told him he would be cofvering  a grea favor by moving me into the  country somewhere as I considered it  wanted a person of more mature  experiance to fill my place. He was  sory to lose me from London but  would do as I requested, so I am  going down to Grays opposite Gravesen  to try and create a little excitement  there It is about twenty miles from 
 death have succeded in scattering the   members of our family, and no doubt on my  return I shall find that the old home  is not what it used to be, same with  whom I was familiar will have gone to   that sleep that knows no waking, others  that were want to do will no longer  contribute their smiles toards the sun-  shine of my life, some of them I hope to   meet beyond the grave in our Fathers  kingdom. I long to see you dear father  more now than ever before in my life  and hope to be able to do so in the  near future if the Lord will. Mother has  not sent me the money yet. It appears  that she did not understand that I wanted  the money untill I sent for it again. I have  written lately requesting her to send me  some at once to New York as it will not  have time to reach me in England. The   telegram you refer to purporting to give  an account of a mammoth conference held   in London is entirely false for no conf  erence was held in September, and the 
 written to Bro. Penrose was handed to him and he  was greatly pleased to hear from you. You say I   must not get discouraged if I do not get filled with  the Holy Ghost and the Spirite of Revelation but to be  satisfied if I can enjoy enough of it to enable  me to preach the Gospel. Well Father that is all I   want and would be very thankfull if I could enjoy  it to that extent (but when a fellow gets up and  makes an ass of himself a few times he is apt to  loose or sutch an experiance is not calculated to  inspire him with a spirite of meakness. It m^a^y be wrong  for me to talk this way but it is fearful hard work  for me to preach the Gospel and more particularly  to the Saints). I feel much better when standing before   a congregation in the street proclaiming the first  principles of the Gospel in their ears; perhaps I under  rate my own abilities at least, so thinks Pres. Penrose  and he said while talking to some parties the other  day about ^me^ it, that he never heard me open my mouth  but what I said something. Well says I every one does  that! No they donte says he some people will talk for  hours and not say anything but you always say some-  thing. This of course was encouraging coming from the  source that it did, (and it is possible that I depreci-  ate myself too much) There is one thing certain and that  is there is no danger of my getting puffed up in the  pride of my heart. My great ambition is to fulfill  my mission with honor and to be able to return

We are glad  that you were kindly received by your aged Parents,   It certainly must have been a happy meeting with  you all. Your journey must have been interesting  to you through the South as well as through the North.  Your visit to your fathers family, we think was quite  timely, as you were enabled to gather a valuable  store of information concerning the genealogy of your  father.    We are pleased with your expression of the public  sentiment concerning Utah Statehood, that the public  spirit is in favor of it. I have never seen as good a  prospect for Statehood as at the present time. We  have much to encourage us to labor for that object.    You speaking of the religion of the day, It is true 
 we quit this place, but not before   gathering a bit of evergreen from one   of the graves. our next call is at  the Allen place of which I am content  with an external view. proceding   some distance farther east on this   road we turn to the south and  pass the old juddge place which is  somewhat dilapidated & unoccupied at  present. And now comes the most  interesting experience of all the visite  to the old Old Mill & your birthplace. We  tied our horse at the mill and got  out of the sleigh. Two brothers named  Hohnes are running the placed. One  of them we found raking ice out  of the race, so the water could reach  the wheel which is situated at the   back of the highest part as shown in the   photography. the water is carried to it  by means of an 18 inch inclined wooden  pipe, the upper end of which connects  with the old race as it stood when   you left it half a century ago.

I paid interest  on it for awhile. I wish to know what interest  is due together with the principle, and as I  have $300.00 in the Bank is there any interest  due me on that amount, if so, how much?  I wish to know how much is required to pay  my note besides what I have in the Bank.    Direct to W. Woodruff, care of James Jack  at the President's Office.

 September 1st [188]7    Mrs Mary Campbell,   Salt Lake City.    Dear Sister: I received your letter  of the 29th and in reply will say that I should be  pleased to have an interview with you if circumstances  were so that I could; but I spend my time mostly  in the country and not located in the City. My circum-  stances are such that I cannot make any appoint-  ment in the City with any certainty. I will say I made  out a balance sheet of all my accounts with your  husband's Estate, which is in the hands of Judge  Elias A. Smith. I would advise you to consult  with him about your affairs. My circumstances  are such that I will not be able to take any further 
 the city down the Thames. I will  come into London about once per  month. I will be amongst stran-  gers almost entirely and will be  under the nescessity of hiring a room  to sleep in as there is no accomodation  for a elder there. Of course the  comforts of body will not be much  but what are the comforts of  body compared to the peace of mind,  they dwindle into insignificance. I  hope you will not take an uneasin-  ess on my account for I will man-  age to pull through it somehow  My desirers are still to do good and  hope that the Lord will make me  instrumental in his hands of pointing  some to the higher law in this   new field. The fruits of my labors  are begining to be made manifest  in Whitechapple as a number have  expressed their intention of entering

I held a meeting here in Grays   on Sunday evening and preached for one  hour to a very large and attentive congre  gation. One week last Sunday morning I  went and heard Spurgeon preach in his  tabernacle and I preached twice myself in   the afternoon and evening.

 home satisfied within myself, and my earnest desire  is that I might have more of the Spirite of the Lord  to aid me in attaining these ends (Why I can not enjoy  my labors better is more than I can tell, the reason   for my being deprived of the comforting influence of  the Holy Ghost is not because I have commited myself  in any way whatever, God being my witness, was it   the result of any act of mine I should have remai-  ned silent in regard to the matter. No! this is not  the cause and what it is the Lord only knows.  Pardon me if any thing herein contained grieves you  I was constrained to say so much) From the "News"  It appears that things are not looking much brighter  at home, but methinks it will not be long before   the clouds will clear away and the blue sky once  more appear above. I see a few of the weak kneed  and limber backed are willing to bow and cringe  and suplicate at the feet of a tyranical judge, but  the majority prefere to remain true to their God at  all hazards. It seems hard that people should be  persecuted in a land of eaquel rights for worship^ing^  God according to the dictates of their own concience  There is sutch a thing — and this world will find it  out some day to its cost — there is sutch a thing  as suffering for rightousness sake. I suppose this  is one of the mediums by which the Lord will bring  about the purification of his Saints. This is not a   struggle betwen a few thousand people in Utah and 
 alone in the streets than I have  and many times I would sooner have  taken a good horse-whipping than  done it, but all this would be joyfully  endured if only the Spirite of the Lord  would dwell with me to comfort me  and support me in times of trial so  far as deriving spiritual benefit is  concerned my mission has ben a  partial failure at least, and I think  my whole life is a failure. I sacrifis-  ed the object of all my natural affect-  tions and the only girl that could  have made me happy in this life,  It was my own fault that she proved  false to me because of the coldness  of my letters. I acted as I did in that   matter thinking that the Lord might  be displeased with that alliance, and  hoping that by disolving it I might  get an increased portion of his spirite  but alas my hopes were vain and   now at times my life is truly 
 that darkness covers the earth and gross darkness  the people, as the Lord has said, and Light has come  into the world in our day and man loves darkness  rather than light because their deeds are evil, and you  going out of Zion into the world this will be more notice-  able by you than it would otherwise be.    Now concerning myself. I will say I heard of the  death of President Taylor the night after I left you at  Warm Creek at Brother Bartholomews. a messenger  arrived from Gunnison gave the news just as I was   going to bed. I did not sleep much that night, next  day we drove 40 miles to Nephi. I there met   Brother A. H. Hyde and we took the cars to Salt Lake.   I spent the day at the office, saw the body of Prest.   Taylor in the evening, and saw the procession  next day as it past the office, there were 102 vehicles   and 7 Bands of Music. I spent the next three weeks  in the City and a good deal of the time in council.   I have been blessed and got along very well. We have  been united in our labors. Brothers Cannon and  Smith have taken their places in the quorum and  we are all working harmoniously together. My health  is good. All the quorum are together in council  except Elders Geo Teasdale and Brigham Young.  We have been looking for the latter some time,  we expect him soomn. All our quorum are so far

I value my mission  for the experiance it has given  me of the world and I know that  the L.D.S. are the most moral chaste  benevolent and God fearing people in  existance and rejoice that I am  numbered among them; but now all  my hopes that I entertained when  leaving home are blasted.

I was much interested with the reading   of your article published in the News which we  ^have^ endeavoured to get inserted in some of the London  papers but thus far without success we have also  make application to about 20 papers for the publication  of the epistle of the first presidency but not one   of that number have deigned to give it space in   their colums.

A conference  will be held in London next Sunday  the 2nd prox. at which Bro Wells and  wife will be present also Elder Osmond  editor of the Star.  The London branches  are going for an outing in Eping Forrest  on the 5th of August.  All the elders are   invited. I have held eleven meetings  in the open air alone since writing  to you last and at one of them  there were between three and four  hundred people present. Several of   them have ben disturbed by ministers  but they have always got the worst  of it. One of them insisted that it was his  imperative duty to warn the people against  sutch abominable ^doctrines^ but he insisted more  strongly in getting out of the crowd bfore I  got through with him.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 505    PRESIDENT WOODRUFF.   said: I want to bear record to this  congregation, and to heaven and earth,  that what Brother Penrose has said is   true; and as a proof of this I will say   that I had a great desire in my heart   at the last election, that we might   have some Republicans in our   Legislature, and we have not got   one. Here is Brother Lund. [Brother   Lund is one of the Apostles.] I believe   he is a Republican. He ran, but did   not get elected. This shows that if I  had anything to do with it, I certainly  had no influence with the people; for  we have got no Republicans in the   Legislature. 
 Pres W. Woodward followed and bore his testimony  to the remarks of Brother Cannon, and stated that no  people, were more blessed than the saints were.  The Lord had raised up a people to whom he had given  his Kingdom, and that Kingdom would remain, when  all earthly Kingdoms would pass away, and the   earth become a sea of glass and be celestial.  He  referred to enoch and his people, and the circumstances   that was connected with their perfection, they became  so perfect that they could not remain here on the earth  and spoke of the great blessings, that God had place  before us, no other people had been so favoured as to   live on the earth when God had established his Kingdom  never more to be turn down, he spoke of the opposition  that spray up in the earth when God [rewealed] himself  to Joseph the Prophet, and spoke of the Law of Tithing and  remarked that the leaders of this church all pay their Tithing none  were more punctual in doing so than they.  He spoke of the  propriety of all paying their tithing at the proper time and  according to the requirement.  He spoke of the redemption of   the dead, and showed the necessity of Temples, in consideration of   which the Lord would enable us us to build and [firnish] our  Temples, that we may go on and officiate for our dead, a  great work remain for us, to do, the departed dead are  awaiting [anxciously] to the completion of our Temple and stated  that the Temple in trust was appropriatly of 50 cents in each month  now for the Temple now in cause of erection.  The Lord  was greatly blessing the saints in this [illegible] of Zion  and we should be thankful to him for all the blessings  we enjoy, and continued by saying that it does not pay  for men or women to apostitize, all who do so always fail  in their efforts 
 Pres. Wilford Woodruff, addressed the Saints and remarked  that if he had all the elders Isreal before him this afternoon  he would like to speak to them a short time and it would  be that when they get up to speak to cease making excuses,   he was displeased to hear such things, he like to hear a  man get up and speak to say what he has to say to say  it without making excuses when the elders stand up to  teach should do so by the aid and insperation of the   Holy Ghost, minester and [Lansgware] trained to speak, He  Spoke of the stamina that is required to [recein] and   live up to the truth, because of the unpopularity of the gospel,  the world hates the saints as it did Jesus when he was om  the earth, The world deride the saints because they are  outspoken against wickedness and coruption, The Lord  had gathered up a people to serve him, and to assist  in the building up of the Kingdom of God, The world  has become infidel and becomign more so continually,  The Christianity of the day in conection with its mini-  sters have sone more to cause infidelity than all the writings of  Professed Infidels put to geather, he refered to the great  evils that exists in the world, The Lord will hold a  great account against the elders of this generation,  because of the great intelligence God has revealed to us,   The heavens are watching over us, and all good men beyond  the veils are [soluntious] for our wefare, and are anxious  that we shal prevail against all the evils that are  brought to bear against us, He spoke of the perminary  of this work because it was of and from God, if it was  of man could be easily prevailed against,  let the  saints then do their duty, adn make our probation  effectual, we lived before we came herein the presence of Heavenly  Father & Mother, It would not now to apostatise from  the Truth, urged the completion of the Temple that we  may redeem the living and the dead, for God requires  this at our hands, The world wonder and gaze at the elders  and this people they wonder more if God has a, hand in  it than he has not, he bore a faithful testimony  to the truth of this world, and assisted the triumph  of this people, and Kingdom, and refered to the  many who have come to an ignominious end who  have fought against this people, he exorted the saints  to be faithful to the end, and be saved in the Kingdom  of God, and implored the blessings of God upon the Saints, 
 Pres. Wilford Woodruff , expressed himself appearingly  of the remarks of the former speaker, he spoke of   the great change, & improvement which have been  wrought in a quarter of a century in these vallies of  these mountains, he spoke of the great future that  is before the saintsjudging from the past what may  we expect to take place in the next 1/3/ of a century,  to come he spoke of the unbelief of the age as [dlro] the  infidelity that is to be found in the world, he refered to  the remarks of Bro. Smith in regard to the proper  training of our children, and thought such remarks  were necessary for the benifit of the young and rising   generation, he spoke of the responsibility resting upon the  saints, and again adverted to the great blessings   that is every where manifest through out all Utah,  hes spoke of the interposition of the almighty in  preserving the saints, and their crops, from the  insects that is here in this country, was glad to  note the increase of the faith ad good works among  the saints & especially the young & urged the saints   to educate & train their children and prepare them  for the work? that lie before them, 
 Pres Woodruff stated that he would not be justified in finding  fault with the farmers for not attending meeting, as it is quite a busy  time. Still no Latter Day Saint can be justified in working on the Sabbath  day. This people are a good people. The treatment we have endured prove  that we a good people. No other people would endure what we have endured    As a people we are lied about more than any other people, that ever lived  upon the earth. He spoke in commendation of the labors of the Female  Relief Society as a great auxilliary in the Church & their labors  are felt & appreciated among the saints

We are not acquainted with what priesthood these  brethren hold, but we presume, should any of them be Seventies, you have con-  sulted with the Presidency of their Quorums, in accordance with the general  instructions.

 gone hungry it has not ben in consequenc[e]  of having no money but because I thought  I might need the money worse at some  future time. I have not yet purchased  the new suit of clothes which would cost   about $20.00 and so I have that amount  and a little more left, but I need them  very badly and will get them immediatel[y]  also some underclothing.

 The Shoreham,  Washington, D. C.,  July 11, 1894.    My dear Sir:    Having at last reached success in the passage through Congress of the bill  admitting Utah to Statehood, it is due to you to know something of the more important  details of the long and difficult contest. The victory which has been reached has come  only through the help of friends whose services can never be forgotten, and through a   patience and persistence of effort which I have never seen equalled. Indeed, in this  contest have been found nearly all the experiences of effort and resistance, of fidel-  ity as against conspiracy, of loyalty to friends as against temptation, and truly all  the experiences nearly that make up the struggles in human life and effort. Coming  into it at a comparatively late stage, and having passed through before many noted  contests, and not having the intense feeling of the struggle for home and independence  that you and your people have felt after so many long and weary years of waiting, I   have naturally been able to judge more impartially of the struggle, of the work of the  people who have figured in it, of the unworthiness of those who have failed in fidelity,  and of the debt of gratitude that all of you must forever owe to those who have stood  in the storm, and through the stress and trial of years overcoming every obstacle,  foiling every treachery, have brought you triumph at last. In my observation of your  people and my analysis of their character I should judge that they are peculiarly en-  dowed with the qualities of appreciation and gratitude. It has been a long and bitter   school in which they have been taught the value of friendship, and the withering, bitter,  unrelenting force of enmity. It is difficult even now to see, as in a few years it will  be impossible for any fair man to see, how remorselessly and persistently prejudice and  malice have followed you and your people in the crusade of over a generation against  you. As intelligent and Christian people, however, you have that quality which is the  most divine in human nature, the quality of forgiveness; and as I have watched this   struggle year after year and seen how strangely things have come out, how your enemies
