President Joseph Smith said he should  not occupy time in speaking of any difficulties  that might have occured in our midst,  said he was not a fallen prophet, &amp; never in  any nearer relationship to God than at the  present time, &amp; would show before the conferen  closed that God was with him. Prayer by  Sidney Rigdon  arose &amp; said it was with no ordinary feelings  he arose to speak, a privilege which he had  not before enjoyed in the same capacity for  five years, and the circumstances of the  occasion points out to me my text which is  the saints of the last Days. I remember in  1830 all the church met in a log cabin, whare  we conversed extensively about laying the  foundation of this kingdom, our minds  expanded far &amp; wide while contemplating  this subject even in that day we talked  as large then as now, we spoke of Great things  that the world could not bear &amp; that is  the reason why we were in secret the world  would laugh &amp; consider us fools &amp; even mob  us becaus we talked about things that wer true  &amp; have and will come to pass yet things that  looked impossible to them because they did  not view them by faith as we do, and if we  should still convers about things in secret it  would be upon the same principle for we   ENDENTRY  any longer unnessarily had we told openly  &amp; talked openly of the things of God that have  &amp; will come to pass our blood would have  been shed we should not have been here  this day. But we hid ourselves up in secret,  there we talked wept, &amp; prayed &amp; the Angels  Administered unto us &amp; the spirit of God was  with us &amp; the heavens opened unto us, but we  should now have been in our grave had we  proclaimed unto the world what God showed  unto us, notwithstanding it was for the benef- it of man, &amp; for his salvation, &amp; not for evil The appearance of this congregation this day  shows the fulfillment of the revelations of  Jesus Christ given in those days. No incident has  taken place in this day but what we spoke of at that early period, all those things were  deeply impressed upon the mind by the God of  Heaven. How could you be made to believe that  you did not live in Nauvoo &amp; have not got habit- ations. Neither could we disbelieve this to be the  Church of God, we cannot disbelieve it for we  see hear &amp; feel. I have always known it to be  I cannot see otherwise. Have I not seen Gods  glory by the visions of heaven yea I have then  what have we to do with the little difficulties  on earth nothing. Those were the beginning  of Good days shut up in a little shop with  nothing to eat but a little Jonnycake &amp; milk &amp; water  ownly as we would occasionlly shoot a squirrel  &amp; we lived in an old smokey house, still we  rejoiced in the things God was revealing unto  us: many think it hard to live in Nauvoo but  we counted those good days God had given   ENDENTRY  men dont think of great things when I  obtained a great &amp; glorious principle I felt  like locking it up lest the people would laugh  at me. And while we were together &amp; telling  one thing we would learn another; I speak of these things to do away with the notion  or feelings about our secret meetings  was their any thing wrong then no, neither  will their be now. No, I have no fear of it what God does is for my salvation &amp; the  salvation of man, &amp; I say go ahead. I have spoken of the grand principle of  the beginning, &amp; I have marvelled at  one thing  church men crept in that were vary  wise more so than God professed to know,  more some of them, it has kept the church  in a continual broil, it was so in the days  of Moses but he disposed of them he killed  them or the Lord destroyed them.     salvation belongs to the Priesthood of God  &amp; why it belongs to us as a people. Men  labor under a mistake ie salvation is distinct  from goverment, salvation is always the  result of goverment evry man has a right to  govern himself in a goverment, as evry good  is a part of the goverment &amp; the laws is for  the defence of a man, we see the need  of laws in this city for their is evil to dispose of  here. I have seen some trials in this city  what some persons were tried for insulting  the Marshall, but any other man is as good as   ENDENTRY  were made by the speaker, when he gave  way untill the Afternoon   Was followed with many usful remarks  from Elder Taylor. The stand was occupied  with with  Lamanites chiefs braves &amp;c    resumed his subject &amp; said we were discusing  in the morning service upon the history of  the Church of Jesus Christ. its a miserable man  that could not manufactor his own text. I have  known many a sermon spoiled by a bad tex The Church of Jesus Christ then. The Hights  of testimony, &amp; amount of evidence that many  of those have had that have fallen away, has  been of such a nature that when they say  they dont believe this work to be true they   in the begining are now seen openly and  their is nothing secret now but what all  will know in time to come, I am aware  their is many things I did not hint at I will  speak of them now. I have seen the time  when the Presidency of the Church sitting  now before me were locked up with me in  secret places waiting upon God we did not  go out at all but to eat &amp;c But it was soon  found out, &amp; a  you to Hell, &amp; threatened our lives, it was at this  time we sat for hours  around the throne of God &amp; gazed upon the  scenes of Eternity. one evening a Mexican  called upon us &amp; he went out armed to see   ENDENTRY  of the fence, he wanted to shoot them, after- wards the mob came in &amp; broke the door, took  me &amp; dragd me out through the streets by my  heels with my head pounding over the frozen  ground. Another company took presiden  Smith, &amp; tar &amp; feathered him, they tried to  this is the reason why we were in secret,  under lock &amp; key. Now if you will let us  work openly we will not work in secret we will work openly as much as you want.  I think I have said enough already to show  that the church has come up through great  tribulation, let this suffice then upon this  subject. Their is men standing in your midst  who are not afraid of men or devels &amp;  men whos mouths cannot be stoped unless  you take their lives for they will speak  in defence of the innocent of virtue &amp; truth  while they live, their is men in your midst  who have learned their is a great God who  can do as he pleases take up the Hills as a  little thing, &amp; such men do not fear  death, they know about heaven they have  seen it &amp; know all about it, their is men  in your midst which you must sustain or  go to Hell, save them &amp; you save yourselves  reject them &amp; you go to Hell. We are 14  years of age now chuse your guardeen  and when you get to be 21, then do business  for youselves you can save yourselves or  Damn yourselves you have just men among  you &amp; the reason is because God has taught   ENDENTRY  reason why they are so. you have men in your midst who will not turn to the right hand or left if you are in their path you must get out you cannot cort by favor or welth or any thing els, they do not ask Poleticians kings or people for favor, they ask God for it alone if the world make them rich or poor they never ask for it. The man whom God has raised up to lay the foundation of this work is placed in such a situation that he cannot fall and He is so lovely that I cannot get mad at him. This is an important part in the History of the Church, the cry of some is I shall not get office if these men are not put down, well God intended to keep them fearing when God sets up his kingdom he will sustain it above all laws &amp; kingdoms of the world &amp; the world has no power over the kingdom of God, the laws will be so strict that the world will make to try to ketch the saints that it will  themselves by the wholesale. we want to build up the Laws of God in Hancock Co. I dont care any thing about all the laws in the world for I will live above them, God teaches his servants to respects kings Gov Presidents, &amp; men in authority. But I have a right to proclaim myself a king and priest unto the most High God, yet I will not transgress  your laws, but dont do as they did in Missouri kill people because they would not  break the law. I dont want any office in this goverment for I am determined to be a king in the kingdom of God, what be   ENDENTRY  office of constable on earth. The kingdom of God may rise up in the midst of the kingd of the world and live above all laws, and not be a law abiding man, I will live above all law I will pay my taxes &amp; obey all requirments that the goverment has uppon me. the reason we was mob in Mo was because we would not have any thing to do with the laws we did not break any we lived above them so they sent a mob upon us. The kingdom of God to the world would be a light in a dark place. The kingdom of God could be set up in any kingdom or country &amp; not break the law but live above it. conference Adjourned till to morrow morning    ENDENTRY April 7, 1844    calm &amp; serene &amp; a vast multitude of about twenty thousand souls assembled together after singing and prayers President Rigdon arose &amp; said, Our borders are enlarged this morning. I shall preach from the same tex we preached from yesterday  of   let the kingdom of God exhist in any goverment Monarchiel or Republican. We intend to show why salvation belongs to this Church ownly. The kingdom of God is a goverment that exerciseing its ownly power in evry respect    ENDENTRY  free will because they want to do the will of God &amp; it is accomplished by truth itself that is manifest from Heaven by intelligence that he sees in heaven and it is power in itself it is on this principle that power rests the Lord begins to teach a man what he can do and if he never   know what he could do. No people can com- prehend it but the Church of God, then one of the main things in the kingdom of God is to let a man know what to do, what glory kingdom &amp; power he can gain, man is taught a principle that when it enters the mind it has a power over death, plagues, sickness, the gift of miracles, this is one great eviden of the work the power of God, this then is the kingdom of God. All religions  that there is in the world that has not these things has a tendency to do hurt instead of doing good for it teaches those things are done away. God has said he would take all the kingdoms of the world out of the way, he would Break in peases &amp; subdue &amp; he would teach the kings and all powers the way that they may have a chance. We say then their is no power any whare els unto salvation. Isaiah said the wilderness should blossom as the rose the lame leap, the blind see, we have got this power here yet the world says it is an imposition. when he comes, He will save you, the lame shall leap, Deaf hear, Blind see, he will come so you need not have sickness or lameness,  salvation in the earth, when we exercise the   ENDENTRY  not war with the sword but with another power, the world has always been sheding Blood. I proclaim peace not war, &amp; this is what he calls the kingdom. Has not the kingdom of God a right to extend in any part of the world to do good. Beat swords into plow shares &amp; spears into pruning hooks, &amp; it shall be a kingdom of glory, peace, ^&amp;^ salvation. Let no man be alarmed because the Lord said that the kingdom of God should swallow up all other kingdoms what harm would it do for all the world would have the same spirit, the Lord said he intended to do by the whole world the same as he has done by us, &amp; this is the thing the world is afraid of, reflect then. This is as far as I intended to go upon this subject, A word then upon the Materials to carry on this kingdom. Any man  els could repent &amp; receive the gospel &amp; become a member of the kingdom as well as the good for when Jesus came he came to call sinners &amp; Harlots came into the kingdom. It dont requir much of an exhertion of the mind, much depends however upon the decision of the mind, it depends upon one action of the mind A man remarked to me He did not belong to a church was not worthy, but this is a mistake. Jesus Christ came to save sinners He saves the unworthy. The Lord will offer a man salvation he says he is not worth, but what would you want your son to do if he was unworthy. He should return to his  father, so with God. He calls to the world to return by Baptism. He cannot make him self any better, but decid with the mind   ENDENTRY  the things of God &amp; heaven &amp; I will make you like myself. I will give you my spirit &amp; make you feel like my family, &amp; this is the  pivot to a God then decide &amp; go &amp; be Baptized then you will be in the way of salvation, if he decide otherwise he will not be any better. A word upon the spirit, this noble decision of the mind causes angels to rejoice in the Heavens for their is more joy over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just persons evry person can do this &amp; no man can do a better work, let no man say they are unworthy. I wish all the teachers of the day could hear me. I was a Baptist &amp; preached their doctrin &amp; was hampered, &amp; hampered others in my teachings and all the teachers of the day do the same. they may be honest but they teach fals doctrins, they call people to the anxious bench &amp; keep them down untill they will say they are willing to be damned But I never was willing to be damned, the doctrin Peter taught was different from sectarianisms. His doctrin was repent &amp; be Baptized &amp; you shall receive the Holy ghost, take a view of this subject look at the spirit of promise, view the congregation on that day they were stranger not having a knowledge of salvation they were strangers to the power of God &amp; did not know  that Jesus Christ was crusified &amp; all they knew about it was what Peter told them on the day of Pentecost, 14  the ownly knowledge they had about the Holy Spirit was what Peter taught them by quoting the prophet Joel 37    ENDENTRY  of it be Prophecy, dreams, visions, revelations &amp;c yes this is the spirit of God the spirit of Prophecy, dreams, visions, heal the sick, &amp; all the great things, &amp; I will in the last days pour out my spirit upon all flesh. this is the definition of the Spirit. All were called to be baptized without any exceptions, villians Harlots Scoundrel and all. A question, how long would it take the sectarian religion before they would prophesy &amp; have the gifts of the spirits of God, it would take seven eternities to do it for it is on a different scheme. I will come to an Anxious bench and get as good a convertion as can be got at an anxious bench, will I be converted to Gods? No, I will be converted to an anxious bench. If I had been converted to God I should have been Prophesying According to the words of Joel, for He said the spirit of God should be poured out upon all flesh &amp; I believe I am flesh &amp; I believe you are flesh &amp; I believe we are in the last days, I will now sum up the testimony, what is a man to preach when they go out, tell the people to repent quit their iniquity be Baptized &amp; you shall recieve the Holy ghost, dream dreams, see visions, &amp; prophecy &amp; if they dont tell them this they preach another gospel.   ENDENTRY 3 oclok PM  ENDENTRY April Sunday 7 FIGURE The following important edefying &amp; interest- ing discourse was delivered by President. Joseph Smith to about twenty thousand souls upon the subject of the death of Elder King Follet    while I addres you upon the subject of the dead The case of our Beloved Brother King Follet who was crushed to death in a well as well as many others who have lost friends will be had in mind this afternoon &amp; shall speak upon the subject in general as far as I shall be inspired by the Holy spirit to treat upon the subject. I want  the Prayers &amp; faith of the saints that I may have the Holy Ghost, that the testimony may carry conviction to your minds of the truth of what I shall say, &amp; pray that the Lord may strengthen my lungs, there is strength here  your prayers will be herd. Before I enter upon an investigation of this subject, I wish to pave the way, and bring up the subject from the beginning that you may understand. I do not intend to please you with oritory but with the simple truths of heaven Edify you. Go to the morn of creation to understand of the decrees of the Eloheem at the creation. It is necessary for us to have an understanding of God at the beginning, if we get a good start first we can go right, but if you start wrong you may go wrong. But few understand the character of God. they do not know they do not understand their relationship to God. the world know no more than the brute beast, &amp; they know no more than   ENDENTRY  about God or his exhistance, except what is given  by the inspiration of the Almighty. go then to  the beginning that you may understand. I ask this congregation what kind of a being is God?  turn your thoughts in your hearts, &amp; say have any  of you seen or herd him or communed with him  this is a question that may occupy your attention The scriptures inform us that this is eternal life  to know the ownly wise God &amp; Jesus Christ whome  He has sent.     being God is I would say If you dont know God  you have not eternal life, go back &amp; find out  what kind of a being God is. If I am the man  that shows you what kind of a being God  is, then let evry man &amp; woman sit in silence  and never lift up his hand against me again  if I do not do it, I will not make any further  pretentions to inspiration or to be a prophet  I would be like the rest of the world, fals teachers  &amp; you would want to take my life. But you  might just as well take the lives of other fals teaches  as mine if I was fals, But meddle not with  any man for his religion, evry goverment ought  to permit evry man to enjoy his religion. I will  show the world is ^w^rong by showing what God is  I am going to inquire after God so that you  may know God, that persecution may cease  concerning me. I go back to the beginning to  show what kind of a being God was. I will  tell you &amp; hear it O Earth! God who sits  in  That  holds the worlds you would see him like a  man in form, like yourselves. Adam was   ENDENTRY  with him. In order to understand the dead for  the consolation of those that mourn, I want  you to understand God and how he comes to be  God. We suppose that God was God from  eternity, I will refute that Idea, or I will do  away or take away the veil so you may see. It is  the first principle to know that we may convers  with him and that he once was man like us,  and the Father was once on an earth like us,  And I wish I was in a suitable place to tell it.   said As the   did even to lay down my body &amp; take it up again  do you believe it if not dont believe the bible I defy all Hell and earth to refute it. And you  have got to learn how to make yourselves God, king  and priest, by going from a small capacity  to a great capacity to the resurrection of the dead  to dwelling in everlasting burnings. I want you  to know the first principle of this law, how cons- oling to the mourner when they part with a friend  to know that though they lay down this dody body it will rise &amp; dwell with everlasting burnings to  be an heir of God &amp; joint heir of Jesus Christ  enjoying the same rise exhaltation &amp; glory untill  you arive at the station of a God. what did Jesus  Christ do, the same thing as I se the Father do  see the father do what work out a kingdom, when  I do so to I will give to the father which will add to  his glory, he will take a Higher exhaltation &amp; I  will take his place and am also exhalted. These  are the first principles of the gospel. It will take  a long time after the grave to understand the whole If I should say any thing but what was in the bible  the cry of treason would be herd I will then  go to the Bible.   ENDENTRY  in and through the head, an old Jew added the word   the gods. I will transpose it in the english language.  I want you to know &amp; learn that the Holy Ghost knows sumthing. The grand Council set  at the head and contemplated the  creation of the world, some will say the script- ures say so &amp; so, but I will show you a text  out of an old book containing the four langua ges, the german is here what does this text  say,  bible says James the son of Zebedee, but this  says Jacob son of Zebedee 21  The Dr says (I mean Dr of Law not of physic)  If you say any thing not according to the Bible  we will cry treason, But if ye are not led by  revelation how can ye escape the damnation  of Hell, here we have the testimony of four. I have  the oldest Book in the world &amp; the Holy Ghost I thank God for the old Book but more for  the Holy Ghost. The Gods came together &amp;  concocked the plan of making the world &amp; the  inhabitants, having an knowledge of God we  know how to Approach him &amp; ask &amp; he will answer  An other thing the learned Dr says the Lords  made the world out of nothing, you tell  them that God made the world out of  sumthing, &amp; they think you are a fool. But  I am learned &amp; know more than the whole  world, the Holy Ghost does any how, &amp; I will  associate my self wit it. Beaureau to organize  the world out of Chaotic matter, element  they are principles that cannot be disolved  they may be reorganized. Another subject  which is calculated to exhalt man I wish to  speak of. The resurrection of the dead   ENDENTRY  come from. The learned says God made it  in the beginning, but it is not so, I know better  God has told me so. If you dont believe it, it wont  make the truth without effect God was a self  exhisting being, man exhist upon the same prin- ciple. God made a tabernacle &amp; put a spirit in it  and it became a Human soul, man exhisted in  spirit &amp; mind coequal with God himself, you  who mourn the loss of friends are ownly seper- ted for a moment, the spirit is seperated for  a little time, they are now conversant with  each other as we are on the earth. I am dwel- ling on the immutibility of the spirit of man, is  it logic to say the spirit of man had a begining  &amp; yet had no end, it does not have a begining  or end, my ring is like the exhistanc of man  it has no begining or end, if cut into their  would be a begining &amp; end, so with man  if it had a begining it will have an end if  I am right I might say God never had power  to create the spirit of man, God himself could  not create himself. Intelligence is Eternal  &amp; it is self exhisting. All mind  of improvement, the relationship we have  with God places us in a situation to advance in  knowledge. God has power to institute laws  to instruct the weaker intelligences that they  may be exhalted with himself this is good  doctrin, it taste good. I can taste the principles  of eternal life, so can you, they are given  to me by the revelations of Jesus Christ and I  know you believe it. All things ^that^ God sees fit  to reveal to us in relation to us, reveals his comma- ndments to our spirits, and in saving our spirits  we save the body, (the same as though we had no (Body   ENDENTRY  to our dead, if they do not be baptized they must  be damned. (I wish I had 40 days to talk) what  promises are made, what can be said if in the  grave, God dwells in eternity, and he does not  view things as we do, the greatest responsibility  lade open us in this life is in relation to our dead Paul cannot be made perfect without us, for it is  necessary that the seals are in our hands to seal our  children &amp; our dead for the fulness of the dispensation  of times, A dispensation to meet the promises made  by Jesus Christ befor the foundation of the world  for the salvation of man. All sins and blasphemys  were to be forgiven except the sin against the  Holy Ghost. God has made provision for evry spirit  in the eternal world, and the spirits of our  friends should be searched out &amp; saved. Any man  that has a friend in eternity can save him  if he has not commit the unpardonable sin. He  cannot be damned through all eternity, their is  a possibility for his escape in a little time. If a  man has knowledge he can be saved, if he has been  guilty of great sins he is punished for it, when he  consents to obey the gospel whether, Alive or dead,  he is saved, his own mind damns him I have no  fear of hell fire that dont exhist. No man can  commit the unpardonable sin, untill He receives  the Holy Ghost. All will suffer untill they obey  Christ himself, even the devil said I am a savior  and can save all rose up in rebelion against God  and was cast down. Jesus Christ will save  all except the sons of perdition. What must  a man do to commit the unpardonable sin  they must receive the Holy Ghost have the  heavens opened unto them, &amp; know God &amp; then  sin against him, this is the case with many   ENDENTRY  to hurt me, they have got the same spirit the devil had, you cannot save them, they make open  war like the devil, stay all that hear, dont make any hasty mooves you may be saved, if a spirit of Bitterness is in you, dont be in haste, Say you that man is a sinner, well if he repents he shall be forgiven. I could go back and trace evry subject of interest concerning the relationship of man to God if i had time, their is many mansions in my fathers Kingdom, what have we to console  us in relation to our dead, we have the greatest hope in relation to our dead of any people on earth we have seen them walk worthy on earth and those who have died in the faith are now in the selestial kingdom of God, they have gone to await the resurrection of the dead to go to the celestial glory, while their is many who die who will have to wait many years. But I am authorized to say to you my friends in the name of the Lord that you may wait for your friends to come forth to meet you in Eternity in the morn of the celestial world, those saints who have been murdered in the persecution shall triumph in the Celestial world while their murderers shall dwell in torment untill they pay the utmost farthing.    eternity soon to meet me, the time will soon be gone, the trump will soon be blown. A question will Mothers have their Children in Eternity? yes, yes, you will have the Children ^But^ as it falls so it will rise. It will never grow. It will be in its precise form as it fell in its mothers arms. Eternity is full of thrones upon which dwell thousands of children reigning on thrones of glory not one cubit added to their stature   ENDENTRY  remarks upon Baptism. I will read a tex in Jerman upon Baptism. John says I Baptise you with water but when Jesus Christ comes He shall administer the baptism of fire &amp; the Holy Ghost. John said his baptism was good for nothing without the baptism of Jesus Christ. Many talk of any baptism not being essential to salvation but this would lay the foundation of their damn ation. There has also been remarks made concern- ing all men being redeemed from Hell, But I say that any man who commits the unpardon- able sin must dwell in hell worlds without end      ENDENTRY April 8, 1844    President J Smith arose and said it is impossible to continue the subject that I spoke upon yesterday in consequence of the weekness of my lungs. Yet I have a proclamation to make to the Elders you know the Lord has led the church untill the present time. I have now a great proclamation for the Elders to teach the church here after which is in relation to Zion. The whole of North and South America is Zion, the mountain of the Lords House is in the centre of North &amp; South America, when the house is done, Baptism font erected and finished &amp; the worthy are washed, anointed, endowed &amp; ordained kings &amp; priests, which must be done in this life, when the place is prepared you must go through all the ordinances of the house of the Lord so that you who have any dead friends must go through all the ordinances for them the same as for yourselves; then the Elders are to go through all America &amp; build up Churches untill all Zion is built up, but not to commence to do this untill the Temple is built up here and the Elders endowed then go forth &amp; accomplish the work &amp; build up stakes in all North and South America. Their will be some place ordained for the redeeming of the dead I think this place will be the one, so their will be gathering fast enough here. President Smith lungs failed him and he appointed elder G. J.

Preach what will save men the same that converted you will convert them.    and the above doctrin was true and I will add a remark to it if a man tries to rise by pulling   ENDENTRY  pot mettle. Preach faith repentance &amp; Baptism say nothing but repentance to this generation need not go into mysteries preach the same over again when I heard Br Joseph make his proclamation yesterday I thought it was a sweepstakes when he said North &amp; South America was Zion. Any Elder that will be wise when he gets his endowment can go into any city &amp; build up the largest church in the city this prooves the prophet true, that the priesthood is fitted for the condition of evry man &amp; woman that was on the earth. will the elders go out this season &amp; preach the things we tell them to &amp; then stop, build up churches in all the world is a perfect knock down to mobs, now Mo Mob away and best let us alone and we will evangelize the world and not make much fuss about it, mob us &amp; we will do it sooner.

It was my mind in the first  place that we should have suitable time to meditate  upon all matters and weigh them, even evry  subject wharein we felt interested. When the  question was asked me if they should con tinue to Baptise for the dead. I said I had no  council to give upon that subject at  should think it not best to attend to it at that  time. I have learned some things I did not know  when I came home. I discover a disposition in  the sheep to scatter abroad now the shepherd is taken  away. I do not say that it will never be right for  this people to go from here or scatter abroad but let  them wait untill the time comes &amp; untill they  get Council to do so. The report has gone forth through  the city that the Twelve     ENDENTRY  company with them, that they shall take all  they can  public  it was the last words I had to say before going into  the Eternal world I would swear by the Holy  Trinity that it  of truth in it, their is no man ^that has^ any right to  lead away one soul out of this city by the consent  of the Twelve, except Geo  Miller ^who have^ had the privilege of taking the Pine Company  whare they pleased but not  the consent of the Twelve to go with them.  is no man ^who has^ any liberty to lead away people into  the wilderness from this Church or to lead them  any whare els  or the Church except the case above named and  I tel you in the name of Jesus Christ, that if  Lyman Wight &amp; Geo Miller take a course contrary  to our council, and will not act in consent with  us  damned and go to destruction, and if men  will not stop striving to be great and ex lead away parties from us and strive to weaken  our hands they will fall and not rise again. and  I will destroy their influence in this church with  the help of God and my brethren. I wish you to  distinctly  Twelve is for evry family that does not belong to the  Pine Company to stay here in Nauvoo, and build up  the Temple &amp; get your endowment, dont  scatter.

I repeat it, let me  reason with you. If you stir up the flame of dissent  will you get an endowment No, you get a party  to run here and another there, and divide our  strength, and weaken our hands and we will be  left and our enemies will flock around us and destroy  us in that case you will not get your endowment  but will sink and not rise go to hell and not to  the bosom of Abraham. do the people leave here because they are afraid^?^  do you fear those that have power to kill the body  power to cast both soul and body in hell. leave this place for fear of the mob before God  tells you to go you will have no place of rest  but you will flee from place to place and go  like the jews untill God raises up some other people to redeem you for if the devil scares you from this place he will scare you from  all other places. Let no man go from this place  but the pine country brethren but stay here^,^ sow  plant, build, put your plow share^s^ into the prairie one plow share will do more to drive off the mob  than two guns. let us stay here  of Joseph and ^Don^ Carloss and father  Smith ^are^, Joseph has said if I am slain in battle or fall any way I want my body  I had rather have the dead body of the prophet  than some men who are alive, and I should rather  have the clothes of the prophet stuffed with straw for President ^of the US^ than any man whose name is now before the nation for a candidate for he would   ENDENTRY  the Temple in this place if we have to build it as the Jews built the walls of the Temple in Jerrusalem with a sword in one hand and the trowell in the other. how easily ^some^ men are scared  know of other men who  the mouth of God is closed to be opened  no more unto us. If this was the case I would  not give the ashes of arie straw for the salvati- ion of the Church. If God has ceased to speak By the Holy Ghost or revelation their is no salvation but this is not the case. Their seems to be a disposition by many to leave Nauvoo &amp;  go into the wilderness or some whare els, but what if we should go into the wilderness, and we  should ask God to give us an endowment, and  he should ask if we were driven from  Nauvoo and who drove you? the devel drove us, would be the answer. well he might say did  you not know that I had power over the devil, yes but one said that I would not give a Jack  knife for all Nauvoo and another said I would  not give a pair of mules for the best farm in Hancock Co and I was afraid. would the Lord give an endowment to a people that would be fritened away from ^their^ duty.^?^ Those that are  wishing to lead away parties contrary to council  I would not wish them damned worse than to have a company after their own liking for  they will soon quarrel among themselves; and if we should go to the wilderness and  ask the Lord, to give us an endowment He might ask us saying did I not give you rock in Nauvoo to build the temple with? yes. Did I not through my   ENDENTRY  stone &amp; prepare  not give you means to build the Temple there^?^  yes. vary well had you  on the walls of the Temple or in your fields I would have taken you to  up men to officiate for you and you would have  by tithing^?^ No well I dont wonder you did  not believe I had power over the devil. Such may go away. But I want to have the  faithful stay here to settle the city. we shall require the 10 tithing for the building of the Temples, the poor and for the Priesthood. I want my support and  living by the church hereafter so that I can  give my whole time to the business of the church I have always supported myself heretofore in all my travels and labours. While in England one  year, we circulated 60,000 tracts upon our  doctrin. this ought to be done in all the world ^and it can be where the Elders are faithful in their calling^  has now sealed his testimony with his blood  and his testiment should now be put in force while the testator lived it was all in his hands but now he is dead. Their is no remission of  sins without the Sheding of Blood. you will soon wake up and know things as they are their  has been a great dept paid. their will be no need  of more Blood of the Saints being shed at present by and by you will understand and see that all is right. WO, WO, WO, unto all who have shed the blood of the Saints and the Lords  Anointed it must needs be that offences come  but wo unto that man through whome they come   ENDENTRY  would say wait untill the time comes. I will  give you the key. South America  is Zion and as soon as the temple is done and  you get your endowment you can go and  build up statkes but dont be in haste, wait untill  the Lord says go. If you have the spirit of  God you can discover right from wrong. when  all is right with the priesthood  rises up and speaks in the spirit of God and  just right All will say Amen but when  a man rises up and talks as smooth as oil  if he is not right their will be many queries  about it^,^ it will not  this as a key. You may go all over North  and South America &amp; build up stakes when  the time comes. The whole continant of  America must be organized into districts  and Presiding elders appointed over each  district, the time has come when all  things must be set in order. I have had these  things upon my mind a long time. the time  has come now for bickerings to scease  be a strict order of things, and we are no longer  bound to harbor black legs, counterfieters, boges  makers, we know all about them they have been  in our midst long enough. I advise all the Saints  to have no dealing with such men let them alone the time has come that they should be wiped  out of our midst, let those men alone, let the ungod- ly dealers alone. And as to the doctors who are in  our midst who are our enemies I would say let  them alone, for I have no boubt but that three  to one who have died in this place had a doctor  and I would say wo unto yo^u^ Lawyers for    ENDENTRY  in its stead. I want the Lawyers to know that  we have common sens^e^ they want to make  you believe that when you spell Baker it  means cider or whiskey; Now let the Lawyers  and doctors alone and leave  evil speaking  and get an endowment. All ye Lawyiers go  away and let us alone, and when we   we may then have a more convenient season   say to all Saints do not harbor black legs coun- terfeiters, and bogas makers wipe them away it is time to carry out the design of our prophet do scease to employ doctors Lawyers &amp; Merchants  who will empty your purs and then mob you Store your grain in Nauvoo for you will want  it here, to eat while you are bilding the Temple.  I want to say to the hands upon the Temple be  united and  dont turn away any person because he is an  Englishman, Scotchman Irishman or any other  nation, but employ evry man you can and build  the temple and your homes. I had rather pay  out evry sent I have to build up this place  and get an endowment If I was driven the  next minute, without any thing to take with me  As to the doctors let them go. I can prove that  a doctor in this place doctored a woman that  was in the family way and did not know it  untill she was delivered, and both woman and  child died, and if you will employ them  you will all die, but the time has come   ENDENTRY  them. their is a distinction between the  law of the Land and the law of the Church  you have the privilege of keeping all shops that  does not come in contack with the Law of  the state county or city, so I will evade the law  says the dealer and give away whiskey and  sell a little tobaco or somthing &amp; charge enough  for both, but the law of the Church will  reach such men if they are members for they  will be cut off. (I had a dream which I will  here relate I saw a fruit tree, &amp; I went into the  tree in search of fruit. I soon discovered that some  of the main branches on ^the^ top g^r^oing from the main  body was dead; It seemed necessary to cut off  the dead branches in order to save the tree so I  told some person to help me cut them off &amp; they  steped on to a large green limb they were afraid it  would break, so I put my sholder under it &amp; held  it up while he cut off the dead branches it cracked  the green limb but it did not break. after we cut  off the dry limbs the wounds healed up and the  tree grew finely) now let us cut of the dead bran ches of the Church that good fruit may grow  and the voice will soon be herd go and build  Zion and the great Temple of the Lord.     into their different quorums and a Presidency  of seven men will be chosen out of the first  seventy to preside over each quorum.

He spoke in an edifying  manner concerning the Book of Mormon its  history what it was &amp;c that it was a history of  nearly one half of the globe &amp; the people that  inhabited it, that it gave a history of all those  cities that have been of late discoverd by Carthe- -rwood's &amp; Stephens, that it named those cities  That it spoke of the esstablishing of our goverm- ent &amp; what is more highly interesting it reveals  its final fate &amp; destiny, so that by reading the  Book of mormon you can clearly see what will  befal this nation, and what will be its final end.  In that Book you will find recorded the pure  principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ as taught  by himself on the Continant of America so plain  that no two persons could disagree as to the points  of doctrin set forth, many interesting remarks  he made upon this subject then bore testimony  of the truth of Joseph Smith  Prophet of God &amp; that the Book of Mormon was  true &amp; that the Church of the Latter day saints  was the true church of God, &amp; after finishing his  testimony he commenced and preached another  sermon &amp; spoke in all a little short of two  hours, after he closed we blessed 5 children  &amp; attended to some other duties we dismissed the  people.

It is right to teach ^the gathering^ according to the scripturs  but we are not left to this alone, we know &amp;  all the Saints aught to know that God has  pointed out a place &amp; time of gathering and  has raised up a Prophet to bring it about of  which we are witnesses, we have not got to go  a long round about the time &amp; place is pointed  out the foundations of the Templ laid  and a people already gatherd &amp; we know to have  to go, &amp; to reject the revelations of God that have  pointed out these things to us ownly brings condem nations, &amp; if this is not the case then our faith  is vain &amp; our works &amp; hopes are vain also we have already got the opinions of men enough  concerning the coming of Jesus Christ. But  we need the voice of a Prophet in such a case  &amp; we have it &amp; I am willing to risk my all  upon it. And if the Elders understand the  principal of gathering and teach it correctly  the people would have the correct spirit of gathering.    that he had  to the scriptures. But he considerd all modern  revelations scripture as well as those given  anciently. P. P. Pratt sayed they agreed  their was no disagreement &amp;c   ENDENTRY  make a few general remarks concerning the  subject of our faith we hear the Elders  represent the feelings of the Brethren concerning  the gathering. The spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ  is a gathering spirit &amp;  the virtuous &amp; good the honest &amp; meek of the  earth, &amp; in fine the saints of God. The time has  come when the Lord is determin to fullfill his  purpose. Had we lived in the days of Jesus Christ  we would say we would receive his work. But  Judge ye if the people are better now than then they are not. When the full set time is come  the Lord came in the flesh to do his work whether  the people were prepared or not. And now the full  set time is come for the Lord God Almighty to set  his hand to redeem Israel we are not bound to  make the people believe but to preach the gospel &amp;  then our garments are clear. The Lord does not  require evry soul to leave his home as soon as he  believes but he requirs him to harken to council &amp;  follow that course that the lord points out, the  spirit of the Lord &amp; this work is on the elect, and  those that keep up with the work must be on  the alert also. When the Lord says gather  yourselves together why do you ask the Lord what  for, is it not the principle of the Saints to mingle  together to promote the great cause in which we  are engaged. Say you cannot the Lord save  us as well whare we are as to gather together. Yes  if the Lord sayes so but if he commands us to  come out &amp; gather together, He will not save us  by staying at home. Have you not received the  gospel yes, then do you believe  we say. Have you not received the Holy Ghost   ENDENTRY  unto you, yes &amp; thousands have &amp; it stands as a  testimony that God has got a Prophet on the  earth, you might have been baptized seventy  times seven in any way except the way God had  ordained and pointed out &amp; you would not have  received the Holy Ghost, this also is a  testimony to you. Are ye ingaged in the great  work with us ye will say yes, can ye do  any good? yes ye can. The sectarian world  send the Bible to the nations of the earth, the  people put in sixpence fifty cts or a dollar into  the box &amp; send Bibles through the world. Then cannot we do sumthing yes, the Lord  requires us to build a house unto his name  that the ordinances &amp; blessings of his kingdom  may be revealed &amp; that the Elders may be  endowed &amp; go forth &amp; gather together the blood  of Ephraim the people of God from the ends of  the earth. Can you get an endowment in Boston No &amp; ownly in that place that God has pointed  out. Now query could moses have got the law had  he staid in the midst of the children of Israel had  he not gone to the mountains? The Lord says  go &amp; do so &amp; so stand before Phario, pull off your  shoes for the ground is Holy &amp;c. Moses obeyed  &amp; obtained blessings, but if he had not obeyed  he would not have obtained the blessing. But why  query about it has the Lord spoken yes then  this is enough. I do not care whether the people  gather or not if they dont want to, I do not wish  to save the people against their will, I wish you  to have your choice either to gather with the  righteous or stay with the wicked, I would like  to have all people bow down to the Lord Jesus Christ  but it is one of the decrees of the Lord that all   ENDENTRY  was the case even with the angels that fell  from heaven.    to build the Temple if so you  will be blessed if not we will build it alone And if you dont harken you will not have  the spirit of the Lord, for the spirit of the  Lord is on the moove. The Apostles tried to  gather the people together in their day. Christ said he  would gather the Jews oft as a hen gathereth her  chickens under her wings but they would not God and Angels dont care whether men hear or forbear they will carry on their work for the full set  time is come and we care about it we must  build a house &amp; get an endowment &amp; preach the  gospel, warn the people, gather the Saints, build  up Zion &amp; finish our work &amp; be prepared for  the Coming of Christ. Now we want to send  missionaries to the Islands can you do sumthing for them &amp; that is not all we want you to  do we want you to give us sumthing to build  a temple we want what you have to spare.  But are you afraid that you will not have  Enough for youself when you get there. But  how easy it is for the Lord to take it away from  you by fire &amp; otherwise. E P Magin had an ^Ivory^ cane I asked him for it but he din give it to me but  he soon lost it &amp; it did neither of us any good But the Lord can give &amp; take away. Jacob with  his faith obtained all the best cattle that his  Father in law had. Who blesses you and all the  people God, but do the people acknowledge the hand  of God in all these things No, they turn away  from him &amp; do not acknowledge him or realize  from whom their blessings flow. Let me tell  you a secret when the Lord shakes the earth   ENDENTRY  then for brass the Lord will bring gold for Iron  silver for stones Iron &amp;c, then you will have  no use for gold, for money &amp; gods as you now  have but the Lord will think as much of it  then as now. Let us have some of your gold  to take to Nauvoo, House so that when the Kings Princes &amp; Nobles  of the earth call at Nauvoo to enquire after  the wisdom of Zion that they may have a place  to entertain them, &amp; that the weary travellor may  be refreshed, is their wisdom in Zion, we  think so &amp; the world begin to think so, let the  world come forward &amp; translate the plates that  have of late come forth, if they have wisdom  to do it. The Lord intends to take away the gods  of the gods of the gentiles the Lord pulleth down  &amp; buildeth up at his own pleasure dont be afraid  of a dollar a hundred or a thousand dollars I  would not I have made a sacrafice a good many  times, the Lord has promised a hundred fold &amp;  I have taken this course to get rich, to give all  I had &amp; God has given many blessings in consequ ence. If I have been to bold in asking, then be  to bold in giving give your all and God will repay  as much again adjurned untill half past 2 oclok    singing &amp; Prayer By Elder P. P. Pratt who arose  and said I have a few remarks to make concerning  the subject spoken of in the fornoon by Elder  B. Young who said  your gold silver &amp; precious things &amp;c we  not ownly want your all as pertains to gold  silver &amp;c but we want you, your wives &amp;   ENDENTRY  I can give you a better pattern of what we want  than the case of Joseph in Egypt. An Israel- ite will get all he can, they are vary great to  go ahead. The Egyptians believed in dreams  &amp; by this peculiar gift Joseph entered into a great  scheme of speculation, he used the gift of dreams  to become great in the eyes of the Egyptians,  had great political influence came out on the kings  horse in great splendor, &amp; lade up corn in great  abundance during the seven years Plenty &amp; in time  of famine got all the gold, silver, cattle property  their own persons, this speculation was from  a Josephite and it was like an Israelite, it was  like Noah, Lot, Christ, &amp;c &amp; it is a fair sample of  our speculation. God is the origin of Power  the Sovreign, &amp; he has a right to reign, &amp; their  will be good times &amp; goverment when the world  will acknowledge the God of heaven their lawgiver  &amp; If I could live under his goverment I should  be thankful, then our prayer would be answered  may thy kingdom come &amp;c untill that time we  must pray for it. This Joseph in Egypt the  speculator what a great &amp; good man he was I love him I admire his course, &amp; I believe a little  of his blood is in my veins. But had Joseph  been like the religious world at the present day he  would not have rode the kings horse &amp; wore his  robe &amp; had nothing to do with gold &amp; silver, &amp; do no  good, save no corn, build no store houses, do none  of these things for fear of speculation. But He done  differently. And their is a prophesy about the modern  Prophet Joseph, being raised &amp; supported by the power  of God to do a work on the earth. And he has been  raised up &amp; the Lord has been with him &amp; evry   ENDENTRY  has had rising of thirty law suits to pass  through &amp; yet he has overcome &amp; no accusation  has been susstained against him, but he will  lay a plan to speculate as large as Ancient Joseph  did, what Elder Young said is good, and even  now we want you to take that course that  will save you. Build up a city &amp; Temples &amp;  enjoy them &amp; do as the Lord tells you &amp; harken  to Council. we have a prophet to tell us what to  do, and we should get as much wisdom as the  world, if the world want a rail road built all  they have to do is to open books the people  subscribe stock &amp; a rail road is soon built &amp; an  income is brought. And the Saints ought to  be as well united as the world, &amp; do the things  that God has required, that a great nation may  be saved from all Nations. The old gentleman  that rules the nations has ruled long enough  and if I was an Infidel I would like to have  the Lord raise up a Joseph or Daniel or sumbod to raise up a change for the good of the world and thank Heaven he has begun to raise them  up to do the great work of God &amp; it will continue  untill the saying goes forth that the Lord  has built up Zion. I read that Gold, silver, power  thrones &amp; dominions will be connected with the  great work of God in the last days, then let us  wake up and enlarge our hearts &amp; prepare for  the great &amp; glorious work, does the Saints here  in Boston know that they are Identifyed  with laying the foundation of a great &amp; mighty  work that is to enclude all the great and  glorious work that is to be fulfilled in the last  dispensation &amp; fulness of times And   ENDENTRY  that whether Boston Saints or who may stand  for it or rise against it that almost numberless  milions will selebrate that day when the founda- tion of this work was laid.    with the many remarks that had been made  this day you can see a similarity between the  two Josephs &amp; the Laws that were given. Says  one who believes that God who dwells in heaven  will speak about building a house &amp;c in this day  of religion &amp; science. But the day was when the salv- ation or damnation of a whole world hung upon  a small circumstance even in the days of Noah the  building of an ark, had the Editors of this day  lived then I think they would have said and  written more against it than they have against  Joseph Smiths Revelations. You talk about God  condesending to speak of small things in the last  days but no more so than it was in the days  of Moses for we read in the bible how God comm- anded the Children of Israel when they found  a birds nest to take the young to themselves but  to let the dam go free, what for, wy that their  days might de be long in the land which  Lord their God giveth them, so come to the point  it was a great thing at last. Yet connecting this with  the word of the Lord concerning eating beetles &amp;  grashoppers was as small business for the Lord to  talk about as it was for the Lord to command  the Saints to build a tavern. This boarding  house when done will do much good for  the spreading of the work to all nations. But  what good could arise from eating beetles &amp; grasshopers  I cannot say   ENDENTRY  A blessing upon the head of Susan Cornelia  Woodruff.     thy head in the name of Jesus Christ &amp; by  virtue of the holy priesthood we bless you  with the blessings of life &amp; health &amp; of Abraham of  Isaac &amp; of Jacob I seal thee against the power of  desease we ask God that thou mayest live  &amp; cross the sea with thy parents &amp; that the  angels may guard thee &amp; we rebuke all weak- nesses &amp; fevers &amp; afflictions ^that thou mayest^ &amp; begin to  amend from this hour according to the  faith of thy parents &amp; shall again return  to this land &amp; we seal all these blessing  upon this child &amp; seal it up to eternal  life that it may be prolonged upon the  earth to bear off the name of thy Fathe &amp;  Mother to future generations with the  blessings of peace &amp; prosperity &amp; with a  gentle spirit in the name of Jesus Christ  &amp; virtue of the authority of the holy priesthood  even so Amen.    will write my Father from England. his addres  Henry M No 2 High Riggs  Edinburgh.
