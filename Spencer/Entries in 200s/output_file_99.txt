I have just return-ed from evening meeting of the Saintsof Oldham in the temperance hall, we hada very good meeting; but there wereno strangers present. I am laboringwith bro Holt, at present in the Oldhamdistrict. This district includes HayfieldStockport Stalybridge Ashton Oldham ShawRoachdale and Middleton. Bro Holt has hada good deal of experiance in the missionaryfield and is well qualified to give me somegood training. Says he was converted tothe truth by a sermon that you preached 
 and not yet returned; but the familyof Saints(?) where he stays when inPortsmouth allowed me to stay overnight I have got out of the firepaninto the fire this time sure! Thereare a very few Saints in this distr-ict and very poor ones at that with one or two exceptions. A great many of the Saints in this country areso weak in the faith that it takesone man on ea side of them withan umberella to keep them in thechurch now that they are in, andwe have to guard every action andworld and almost our very thoughtsfor fear of offending some of them,but they are not at all particularwhat kind of language they use tous; but I am like the Drummerthat gets kicked down stairs and has doors slamed in his face, I never[g]et insulted.

The next andin some respects the greatest curiosity, is the whirlpool & rapids where capt Weeb was drownedhere the river makes a complete elbo like this[FIGURE] you see the stream passes in on the right sidemaking a complete circle to the left passing outunder the incoming stream, at this point thesuction is so strong, it will draw a largeboat under, across the mouth where the lineis drawn is 1860 ft, the deepest part 300 ft. WellI will tell more about it when I get home. Iam figuring on that problem you gave me& will probably have the answer again I get home.Rolled out of Clifton well pleased withe our days experiance, with a light heart & a lighterpocket at 4:30 PM. You have heard ere this Isuppose concering my experiance at sea, onething I forgot to mention, was that we passedthrough a large school of Whales on the trip 
 was thoroughly enjoyed. I of courseadded my mite to the eveningsentertainment. After the exerciseswere over, games of a sociable char-acter were indulged ^in^ by the localSaints; we Elders however did nottake part in them for obviousreasons, but taking it all togatherwe had a very enjoyable time. I went through the Manchester Art Gallerya few days ago where several thou-sand specimens are on exhibitionsnearly all the leading artists in thecountry are there represented. Thefinest picture of the collection inmy estimation is one called "DantesDream," it measures about 12 x 14 ftand is valued at $5,000. Our newElder (Bro Fowers) put in an appear-ance for the first time on Saturdayhe is well but I rather think a littlehome sick. Pres Williams has ben

I am at present ata Mr Watsons whoes residence is located onthe Duke of Southerlands estates near theTrent river, his wife is the only memberof the family who is in the church & sheis a good woman, we entertain hopes ofleading Mr. W. down to the waters of baptismin the near future as he has already express-ed himself to the effect that he is satisf-ied ours is the only true church of christMy companion & I are still prosecuting our 
 my mind as I saunterd up and downthe streets waiting for the time to arrivefor me to start my meeting. Many peopleturned and paused a few moments tolook at the stranger in their streets, forthey readily recognized me as sutch. Theymay have taken me for a temperancelecturer a Fenian or almost anythingbut one of those poor deluded mormonsCould it ^be^ possible that out of all of these;children of our com^m^on Father that therewas but one who knew him? Yes sutchwas the case, and this one was there forthe purpose of telling his brothers and sisters how they might know and pleashim their Father. But if ever gross darknescoverd the minds of any people, they areto be found here in England, and if there are any people on the face of thewilde earth who are lovers of pleasuremore than lovers of God, they arehere in England. And yet I do not thinkthey are one whit worse if as bad asin other lands. Well to return. At about6-30 I repaired to the market and 
 but I doubt very much whether their son'swent without a good long purse. Of courseI believe if an Elder is in a tight place theLord will provide for him, in fact Hehas provided for me although I had plentyof money in my pocket. Ask Wm Wagstaffwhat he thinks of the British missionto day and what it cost him. I think Iam perfectly safe in saying that I havespent as little as any one in the field. I neverride only when I am compelled to throughforce of circumstances for I would justas soon walk throu 12 miles through thisbeautiful scenery as not. I would not be a Woodruff if I would not. No FatherI have not spent $20.00 a month nor$500 a month out side of clothing, soI have plenty money for a long time,yet with care, and I was greatly surprizedwhen I rec'd the draft, but I can takecare of it for future need. I would notmention what bro Smith said to me, it mightcause jealousey. Dont send any more moneyor mention it until I ask for it which wontbe for some time. Your affectionate Son, Asahel.

At Ecles a fewnights ago we were holding a meetingwhen bro Allen finished speaking thecrowd—which had ben warming upat the rate of about one degree prminute—was just about at boilingpoint; they said I must not occupyover 30 minutes, but as they were not running the meeting I determined to speak as long as the Spirit promptedme to, however at the expiration ofhalf an hour the one big burly fellowwith a club in his hand and an exager-ated hat on his head who had boiledover the rim of the rabble pot enterd thering in which I was standing and walkup to my side, thinking perhaps that hisvery appearance would strike terror tomy heart and cause me to flee but Idid not feel the least bit like runningon the contrary I felt quite at home soI just turned the battery on him andshouted into his ear, he stood it for

Next went with Bro Woolleyto Hibbard Spencers Co Hardware dealers,one of their men showed us through thebuilding from cellar to garret; the structureis 150 x 150 six stories including cellar withof stock of one millian & Employees to thenumber of 350. From here we proced to theChicago tower 180 ft high, from this heightwe got an excelent view of the city, whichstreches away farther than the eye can reachin all directions. We then crossed of overto the chicago water works & saw thelarge pumps to work, three in number, theypump, respectively 36. 18 & 11 million gallonseach per day, making a total of 63 milliongal per day. It requiers 50 tons of coal ea[ch] dayto keep these huge humps in opperationFrom here we walked down to Lincoln parkthe beauties of which far surpass any thingI had anticipated, here nature is imitatedso perfectly that I began to thingk I was upsome of our canyons instead of in chicago[page torn]are almost all kinds of Birds & beasts collected

I would sooner chop woodor dig post holes than preach, I don't likeit, but am studying hard and intendto do my verry best, with the Lords helpI visited the free trade hall in Manchesterlast week where you preached fourty three years ago. I often wonder when ploddingover these paved roads or through thegreen fields, if you dident travel the sameroad many years before and when I sitdown on the bank to rest I imagine yousitting in the same place.

Have you ever bento Portsmouth?  If so you will perhapsremember that it is built on the island of Port-Sea and that the portnearest the mainland is composed ofrather unpretetious buildings whilealong the sea beach next the Isleof Wight are to be found some splendidhotels as well as private mansions et[c.]I had the privilige yeasterday of seeingseveral Men-of-War lying in the harboramong the number was the Victoryon which Lord Nelson lost his life 
 3brobaly fifty in number. Capt Bently said someof the larger ones would measure and hundredand thirty feet. Had a pretty rough sea thesecond day before landing, it was verrydificult to keep our feet on deck, at the approachch of an extra high sea, the passengers would grab something for an anchor, & those who failed to do so were hurled with less ceremonythan dispatch against the railing or bulwarks.It was laughable to see five or six big fellowsrolled against the side and after befor they couldregain their feet back to the other; but we tookit all in good part & as the captain said thestronger the wind blew, the biger noise the baymade. It was as good as a concert at tableduring the rough sea cups & saucers sugar& pickles & all salts of eatables got mixed upin a incongruous mass untill it was dificultto tell what we were eating. Weel Father I enjo-yed my trip very much; but when I struckLiverpool a cold chill ran through me, andI felt as if I wanted to go home again; butthat feeling is leaving me by degrees as I getbetter acquainted with the people, their customs 
 on a visite in South Wales amo-ngst his rellatives and not yetreturned; so it was decided at ourlast council meeting that ElderFowers should labor with ElderAllen in the Tilsley district untilPres. W.'s return at least. This arrangementleaves me to travle alone in the Leek district for the present at anyrate, but I dont mind it so muchbecause there are some placeswhere the people are so poor thatthey are scarcely able to accomodatetwo but that can get along with allvery nicely, so we see as the old say-ing goes there is no great loosswithout some small gain. Of courseI miss at times a companion to talkto and feel a little lonely in consequence.Still I would just about as soon bealone. The days are getting so shortand the weather so chilley that wethink it adviseable to discontinue 
 labors with unabating interest & and everyevening that the weather will permit of ourvoices may be heard reverberant throughthe quiet country viliages after the wearyfarmer has repaired from his wearisomtail to seek repose beneath his humbelroof or perhaps to loiter at a side roadinn or they may be lost in the neverceasing din of the larger towns & cities.I have not as yet had the pleasure ofbaptizing any one, but we have succedin allaying considerable prejudicewhich has existed through here forlack of correct information on thesubject. I dont intend with the Lordshelp to become discouraged, and it shallnot be throug lack of dilligence on mypart if my efforts are not crownedwith success I do not believe it is theElder that does the most baptizing alw-ays that is the most faithful workeron the contrary in my opinion it is the [worker]for he may be sent as I have in Coya new district comparatively and whileno doubt there are some who are can-

 outdoor meetings altogather forthis season. The work goes on veryslowley in the best districts andin some places it seems to becloseing up altogather, but while thework is closeing up in England it is opening up in other places, as forinstance in Belfast & environs-northof Ireland there have ben thirty bapt-isms during the summer and theElders laboring in that part thinkthere are good prospects of addingmany more to the fold, if the effortsof the Elders be maintained. The Eldersin the conference are all enjoyingpretty good health, the same may besaid of all in the mission so faras I know. Am glad to heare thatLeslie feels contented.

I have just returned from sister Chamberswho lives in another part of thetow[n]. God has certainly blessed mewith a few godod friends to admin-ister to my wants and this kind Sister is one of them; althoughI have only known her for alittle over a month it seems thatI must have known her for 
 4and habits. You ask me how I like sea sick-ness; well a little goes a long ways. I thinkEngland a verry pretty country & if they had ouratmosphere so pure & healthfull with aboutone fourth the present population and theyabout 400 years more modern in theirhabits (for they are about that far behind the americans)I would like to live here, but as they are to dayif I was offerd one half the Island it would beno inducement. Of course this is an exagerationbut I am not in love with the country.Preaching is up hill work for me I fear itis not my forte, still I keep pegging away andmay accomplish something in two years. We have not had any rain for three weeks, thepeople tell me they dont remember a time whenthe rain held of so long at once. I learn fromfrom the papers you are having high watters at home, well I expected as much consideringthe vast amount of snow there was in themountains I wrote a letter to mother the otherday in answer to one I recieved from her, trustshe got it all right. I see by the paper thatWelcome is again sentenced to be shot 
 vinced of the truth yet it takes themsome time to muster up courage toembrace it. It is now as in days of old,"Paul may plant, Apollos may water, but Godgiveth the increase" I do not want you tomisconstrue my meaning that the districtwe are in is a new one entire, but there areseveral places we have ben to of the oldbeaten tract which the elders have notvisited for many years and one place (HulmesC Chappel) they had never heard the mormons preach. The day I posted my last letter to youwe preached at Crew a large R. R. centre fromwhich place a person can be booked to anypart of the United Kingdom; the elders havenot preached there since twenty years ago,when on one occasion at the baptism ofsome people one woman was accidentily drownedsince which time the sound of the gospelhas ceased to be heard there. But this iswhat I want to tell you when we entered^who meets little success so far as thenumber of baptism is concerned thatin many instances does the most good^the town I felt verry downcast & the verry 
 questions on the principles of whichI had spoken and I would endeavorto answer them to their entiresatisfaction, but no one raised adissenting voice, so I extricatedmyself from the crowd and mademy way to the depot feeling thankfulto the Lord that he had strengthened me with his Holy Spirit so that I mightwarn the people. If I did no othergood I am satisfied I succeded inallaying any prejudice that might haveben exisitng there. I made the acquaint-ance of a gentleman on the train andpreached to him as we sped alongover the rails, arrived at Mattramstation all ok and repaired to a Saintshouse near by where I passed the nightretiring well satisfied with my days work conscious of having done my duty. I send Bro Day's bro a Deseret newsnow and then. I am preserving all theletters I rec. I was much pleased withyour's and Mothers letters. Give kind loveto all the family and friends. Asahel. 
 any thing if I could see the fruits of mylabors in return. But if there are manymore converts made in this country it will have to be through some specialeffort of the Almight, for the country isbeing continualy flooded with misrepres-entation about us as a people. Anti Mormlecturers are doing their utmoast topoison the public mind and close hallsand ears against us and this they havesucceded in doing very effectualy, forthe mere mention of Latter Day Saintor "Mormon" has about the sameeffect on them as the shaking of a redblanket has on a wild bull.

We areat present in Audley a small town inStaffordshire about 35 miles south of MancheterI will give you a little account of my laborsfor the past ten days At our last fast 
 air of the place seemed to be full of a dread-fuly oppressive influence, this feeling seemedto increase more & more & when I was speakingthe ground under my feet seemed to rise &fall and around us there was a wall of thinbluish vapor quite perceptible. I did not mentionmy feelings to my companion until after themeeting for fear he would think I was gettingthe blues; but on acquainting him with myfeelings I found that he was undergoing asimilar experiance. I am satisfied it was thetwo powers of light & darkness striving forthe supremacy that caused sutch a feelingat our meeting; as soon as we left the placeon the following morning the feeling leftus. That place is the Devels own stronghold& he & his imps have full possession. Weare going there again this week, and I hope Ishall not have the same experiance for itis a terrible feeling.

It is as bro Lanbert said theother day—much harder in the British mission to day, than it was yearsago when you could go out and hold a meeting and have two or morecome up afterwards and request baptism, then the Elders had somethingto stimulate them something to encourage them. but now we can travelthe country from one end to the other and preach from daylight till darkand all the encouragement we get is the scoffs, scorns and contumely ofand ungratful generation, or else our words fall like water on a ducks

(he came over when I did)There is a posibility that Elder Eddie,Woolley, will be called to take a missionto "Turky". This is the way matters standat present as I understand them, a gentlemanin Turky (a native) who has ben investig-ating the principles & becoming favorablyimpressed has writen to J H Smith desireinghim to send some Elders there, believeing theywill be able to accomplish much good there;in compliance with this request Pres. Smith sent a requisition to "Salt Lake" for two youngmen haveing some understanding of the langu-age, and if sutch young men are not at handhe will send Eddie Woolley and Ricy Jones ofBrigham City, ^the later^ now laboring in the Welshconference.

I think there will be nodifficulty about getting their consent to our marrage providing we remain silent on this point; but themoment this subject should be mentioned the whale fat would be in the fire, and they woulduse all the influence they could to prevent herbecoming my wife. Under these circumstances wehave thought that the only course left openfor us, is to defer the baptism untill after marriagewhen she will be baptized and as soon as wecan get recomends go throught the temple. Thisin brief is a clear statement of the situationI sometimes wish that we had remained aswe were; and had I have followed my ownjudgment in the matter instead of listening tothe persuasions of others, I would not now beconfronted with this vexatious situation. ButIda has given up all for me and now I muststand by her. An early consideration and reply to this will be highly appreciated.

In addition to meetings I am tractingin the daytime and spending my spare evenings atsome strangers house when I can get the opportun^ity^I may have ommited sometimes to state what lettersI have received from you not having them withme, but do not think any have ben lost. The letter 
 turned gray and you would notconvince them to the contrary, andindeed the time has fully arrived thatwas spoken of by Isiah when he saidthat darkness should cover the earthand gross darkness the minds of thepeople; they have heaped to themselvesteachers having itching ears who haveturned away their ears from thetruth and they have ben led astrayafter fables. I am still holding agood many open air meetings butthus far to all humane appearanceswith but little if any success. StillI realize that it is my imperativeduty to warn the people and thatit will be woe unto me if I preachnot the gospel, if it were not so I should not be so often seen and heard in the streets proclaimingthat glad tidings of great joy; forrealy there is no joy no satisfactionin preaching to sutch an indiferent 
 squad of policeman. Bro Wells didnot venture out to the evening meetingas he for some reason, appeared tobe the pincaple object of their hatred.One of the elders at L-pool is collecting the portraits of all the elders inthe mission for the purpose of send-ing to Copenhagen to have them allarranged on one card, each conferenceto be classed by it self, and will be avery nice thing when completed at a costof 18 pence each. I am still doing somepreaching in the open air and distributingtracts at the houses, but the prospectsfor converts areis vary a secure gi[ven]. Rejectionis to commonplace to be attractive andI think if there is one place more thananother on this little earth of ours where the people are in the dark in regardto religous matters it is here in Grays.Notwithstanding there is a chapel in nearlyevery street. After a long dry spell we werefavored this morning with a regular oldfashioned English rain. Well I must say good by once more, Your loving Son A H Woodruff 
 a pleasant time though there were but few thereNaomi & I went down to our corn patch last nightand pulled about ten bushels of corn in  the earwhich she is going to dry for winter so if theworst comes we will have corn & bread to eat thiswinter.  Wheat is now quoted at 35 cents per bushel & potatoes @ 20 cents. None of the banks have suspendedthough thing avalible cash is growing beautifuly lessday by day. Business here in the store is gradualydrying up, people confining thin purchases to thebare necessities, which leaves everything not strictlystaple on our hands,. People feel a littel more hopefulhowever owing to the improved tone in easternmarkets. A house in East Waterlow just South ofS. W. Sears was burnt to the ground on Mondaynight, origin unknown, but supposed to be incendiary.A row of houses belonging to Wm Butterworth of theSixth ward was destroyed by fire the same nightTramps are becoming very numberous in our neighbor-hood lately. Two called the other evening when Owen wasaway & told the girl if she did not give them somethingto eat they would call again after dark.

 your pathway through life. The report about my cominghome refered to by Nellie in her letter was to the effect thata number of the young men were to be sent home this fall to make room for a certain class of missionarieswhich are known here as gentile missionaries in consequence as it is in consequences of the gentile incluencebeing brought to bare upon them that we are favored withtheir presence in this country, but I disremember having saidanything farther from which she might infeer that I wasexpecting to return home this fall. Nevertheless I am quiteagreeable to come home and help take care of mother and family and do what I can to assist in your matters thereYour letter addressed to Bro.

 ST. DENIS HOTEL.BROADWAY & ELEVENTH ST.NEW YORK.EUOPEAN PLAN.WILLIAM TAYLOR, PROPRIETORentered this sacred spot, proceding up the centre walk we soon foundGreat-Grand Father & Grand Mother Woodruff'sresting places with the toomb stonesfaceing West. I recognized them in a moment from the photos which you have of them. It would be difficult to describe the feeling which came overme as I gazed upon this halowed restingplaces of my long since departed kindred& thought that perhaps you had stoodon the same spot many years before.It may have been the cold that causedmy eys to moisten. this is a delightfulspot at sutch as one could wish to restin till called forth to a brighter existencean iron fence surrounds the yard& a row of splendid pine's cast theirapproving shadows upon this matchlesshome of the dead. With slow steps(over) 
 hungry till a Saints house is reached and then in many instances the food provided isonly sufficient to sharpen ones appetite. Butdear father dont think that I wish to complainfar from it, for I am enjoying my laborsas well as could be expected with sutchdiscourageing success and the unsettledconditions of things at home. There areabout forty members in this district alltold but about one half of them are onthe fence and the other half are scatterdfrom Dan to Barsheba. The Queen came toPortsmouth last night and went on boardher yacht. She leavs for Germany this morningThe approaches to the Dock Yard were lined withanxious spectators eager to get a glimpse of hermajesty (myself among the number) through the carwindow as her train passed by and a sighof disapointment ascended from the throngwhen after waiting for more than 30 minutes Shepassed by in a closed carriage, and baffledand crestfallen the crowd dispersed. Consider-able excitement prevails here in millitarycircles owing to the crittical conditions of thingson the Afghan frontier. Englishmen are confidentof their ability to give the Russian Bear anotherthrashing if necessary and the seem eagerfor the fray. Got a letter from Nellie last nightI am going to Brighton next Thursday to visitethat branch Your affectionate Son A H Woodruff 
 going to change my field of laboragain, but sutch is realy the case.My duties in the Whitechapple branchare more that I can bare up und-er and if followd up would landme in the insane asylum or someother charitable institution. My pbrainhas become so feverish with thecontinual strain upon it that Iscarcely now what a moments peaceof mind is, so this morning I wentand laid my case before Pres. Penroseand told him he would be cofveringa grea favor by moving me into thecountry somewhere as I considered itwanted a person of more matureexperiance to fill my place. He wassory to lose me from London butwould do as I requested, so I amgoing down to Grays opposite Gravesento try and create a little excitementthere It is about twenty miles from 
 death have succeded in scattering the members of our family, and no doubt on myreturn I shall find that the old homeis not what it used to be, same withwhom I was familiar will have gone to that sleep that knows no waking, othersthat were want to do will no longercontribute their smiles toards the sun-shine of my life, some of them I hope to meet beyond the grave in our Fatherskingdom. I long to see you dear fathermore now than ever before in my lifeand hope to be able to do so in thenear future if the Lord will. Mother hasnot sent me the money yet. It appearsthat she did not understand that I wantedthe money untill I sent for it again. I havewritten lately requesting her to send mesome at once to New York as it will nothave time to reach me in England. The telegram you refer to purporting to givean account of a mammoth conference held in London is entirely false for no conference was held in September, and the 
 written to Bro. Penrose was handed to him and hewas greatly pleased to hear from you. You say I must not get discouraged if I do not get filled withthe Holy Ghost and the Spirite of Revelation but to besatisfied if I can enjoy enough of it to enableme to preach the Gospel. Well Father that is all I want and would be very thankfull if I could enjoyit to that extent (but when a fellow gets up andmakes an ass of himself a few times he is apt toloose or sutch an experiance is not calculated toinspire him with a spirite of meakness. It m^a^y be wrongfor me to talk this way but it is fearful hard workfor me to preach the Gospel and more particularlyto the Saints). I feel much better when standing before a congregation in the street proclaiming the firstprinciples of the Gospel in their ears; perhaps I underrate my own abilities at least, so thinks Pres. Penroseand he said while talking to some parties the otherday about ^me^ it, that he never heard me open my mouthbut what I said something. Well says I every one doesthat! No they donte says he some people will talk forhours and not say anything but you always say some-thing. This of course was encouraging coming from thesource that it did, (and it is possible that I depreci-ate myself too much) There is one thing certain and thatis there is no danger of my getting puffed up in thepride of my heart. My great ambition is to fulfillmy mission with honor and to be able to return 
 Sept 5th [188]7.Elder A. K. ThurberSouth Scituate, Rhode IslandDear Brother,Your very interesting letter of Aug. 28th has beenreceived and read with much interest. We are gladthat you were kindly received by your aged Parents, It certainly must have been a happy meeting withyou all. Your journey must have been interestingto you through the South as well as through the North.Your visit to your fathers family, we think was quitetimely, as you were enabled to gather a valuablestore of information concerning the genealogy of yourfather.We are pleased with your expression of the publicsentiment concerning Utah Statehood, that the publicspirit is in favor of it. I have never seen as good aprospect for Statehood as at the present time. Wehave much to encourage us to labor for that object.You speaking of the religion of the day, It is true 
 we quit this place, but not before gathering a bit of evergreen from one of the graves. our next call is atthe Allen place of which I am contentwith an external view. proceding some distance farther east on this road we turn to the south andpass the old juddge place which issomewhat dilapidated & unoccupied atpresent. And now comes the mostinteresting experience of all the visiteto the old Old Mill & your birthplace. Wetied our horse at the mill and gotout of the sleigh. Two brothers namedHohnes are running the placed. Oneof them we found raking ice outof the race, so the water could reachthe wheel which is situated at the back of the highest part as shown in the photography. the water is carried to itby means of an 18 inch inclined woodenpipe, the upper end of which connectswith the old race as it stood when you left it half a century ago.

 September 1st [188]7Mrs Mary Campbell, Salt Lake City.Dear Sister: I received your letterof the 29th and in reply will say that I should bepleased to have an interview with you if circumstanceswere so that I could; but I spend my time mostlyin the country and not located in the City. My circum-stances are such that I cannot make any appoint-ment in the City with any certainty. I will say I madeout a balance sheet of all my accounts with yourhusband's Estate, which is in the hands of JudgeElias A. Smith. I would advise you to consultwith him about your affairs. My circumstancesare such that I will not be able to take any further 
 the city down the Thames. I willcome into London about once permonth. I will be amongst stran-gers almost entirely and will beunder the nescessity of hiring a roomto sleep in as there is no accomodationfor a elder there. Of course thecomforts of body will not be muchbut what are the comforts ofbody compared to the peace of mind,they dwindle into insignificance. Ihope you will not take an uneasin-ess on my account for I will man-age to pull through it somehowMy desirers are still to do good andhope that the Lord will make meinstrumental in his hands of pointingsome to the higher law in this new field. The fruits of my laborsare begining to be made manifestin Whitechapple as a number haveexpressed their intention of entering

Jones and I spent a very enj-oyable day at the Crystal Palace on the 24thult. Bro Rix wrote you a letter which I addressed. I held a meeting here in Grays on Sunday evening and preached for onehour to a very large and attentive congregation. One week last Sunday morning Iwent and heard Spurgeon preach in histabernacle and I preached twice myself in the afternoon and evening. Inclosed you willfind my photo it has not quite sutch a serious look as the other one. I did notreceive yours it must have got lost. We arehaving cold October winds.

 home satisfied within myself, and my earnest desireis that I might have more of the Spirite of the Lordto aid me in attaining these ends (Why I can not enjoymy labors better is more than I can tell, the reason for my being deprived of the comforting influence ofthe Holy Ghost is not because I have commited myselfin any way whatever, God being my witness, was it the result of any act of mine I should have remai-ned silent in regard to the matter. No! this is notthe cause and what it is the Lord only knows.Pardon me if any thing herein contained grieves youI was constrained to say so much) From the "News"It appears that things are not looking much brighterat home, but methinks it will not be long before the clouds will clear away and the blue sky oncemore appear above. I see a few of the weak kneedand limber backed are willing to bow and cringeand suplicate at the feet of a tyranical judge, butthe majority prefere to remain true to their God atall hazards. It seems hard that people should bepersecuted in a land of eaquel rights for worship^ing^God according to the dictates of their own concienceThere is sutch a thing — and this world will find itout some day to its cost — there is sutch a thingas suffering for rightousness sake. I suppose thisis one of the mediums by which the Lord will bringabout the purification of his Saints. This is not a struggle betwen a few thousand people in Utah and 
 alone in the streets than I haveand many times I would sooner havetaken a good horse-whipping thandone it, but all this would be joyfullyendured if only the Spirite of the Lordwould dwell with me to comfort meand support me in times of trial sofar as deriving spiritual benefit isconcerned my mission has ben apartial failure at least, and I thinkmy whole life is a failure. I sacrifis-ed the object of all my natural affect-tions and the only girl that couldhave made me happy in this life,It was my own fault that she provedfalse to me because of the coldnessof my letters. I acted as I did in that matter thinking that the Lord mightbe displeased with that alliance, andhoping that by disolving it I mightget an increased portion of his spiritebut alas my hopes were vain and now at times my life is truly 
 that darkness covers the earth and gross darknessthe people, as the Lord has said, and Light has comeinto the world in our day and man loves darknessrather than light because their deeds are evil, and yougoing out of Zion into the world this will be more notice-able by you than it would otherwise be.Now concerning myself. I will say I heard of thedeath of President Taylor the night after I left you atWarm Creek at Brother Bartholomews. a messengerarrived from Gunnison gave the news just as I was going to bed. I did not sleep much that night, nextday we drove 40 miles to Nephi. I there met Brother A. H. Hyde and we took the cars to Salt Lake. I spent the day at the office, saw the body of Prest. Taylor in the evening, and saw the processionnext day as it past the office, there were 102 vehicles and 7 Bands of Music. I spent the next three weeksin the City and a good deal of the time in council. I have been blessed and got along very well. We havebeen united in our labors. Brothers Cannon andSmith have taken their places in the quorum andwe are all working harmoniously together. My healthis good. All the quorum are together in councilexcept Elders Geo Teasdale and Brigham Young.We have been looking for the latter some time,we expect him soomn. All our quorum are so far

Thus far I have keptmy own council and the elders do notknow anything about it, only Bro Pensase knows that there is something wrongwith me.  You can keep this to yourself

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 505PRESIDENT WOODRUFF. said: I want to bear record to thiscongregation, and to heaven and earth,that what Brother Penrose has said is true; and as a proof of this I will say that I had a great desire in my heart at the last election, that we might have some Republicans in our Legislature, and we have not got one. Here is Brother Lund. [Brother Lund is one of the Apostles.] I believe he is a Republican. He ran, but did not get elected. This shows that if Ihad anything to do with it, I certainlyhad no influence with the people; forwe have got no Republicans in the Legislature. 
 Pres W. Woodward followed and bore his testimonyto the remarks of Brother Cannon, and stated that nopeople, were more blessed than the saints were.The Lord had raised up a people to whom he had givenhis Kingdom, and that Kingdom would remain, whenall earthly Kingdoms would pass away, and the earth become a sea of glass and be celestial.  Hereferred to enoch and his people, and the circumstances that was connected with their perfection, they becameso perfect that they could not remain here on the earthand spoke of the great blessings, that God had placebefore us, no other people had been so favoured as to live on the earth when God had established his Kingdomnever more to be turn down, he spoke of the oppositionthat spray up in the earth when God [rewealed] himselfto Joseph the Prophet, and spoke of the Law of Tithing andremarked that the leaders of this church all pay their Tithing nonewere more punctual in doing so than they.  He spoke of thepropriety of all paying their tithing at the proper time andaccording to the requirement.  He spoke of the redemption of the dead, and showed the necessity of Temples, in consideration of which the Lord would enable us us to build and [firnish] ourTemples, that we may go on and officiate for our dead, agreat work remain for us, to do, the departed dead areawaiting [anxciously] to the completion of our Temple and statedthat the Temple in trust was appropriatly of 50 cents in each monthnow for the Temple now in cause of erection.  The Lordwas greatly blessing the saints in this [illegible] of Zionand we should be thankful to him for all the blessingswe enjoy, and continued by saying that it does not payfor men or women to apostitize, all who do so always failin their efforts 
 Pres. Wilford Woodruff, addressed the Saints and remarkedthat if he had all the elders Isreal before him this afternoonhe would like to speak to them a short time and it wouldbe that when they get up to speak to cease making excuses, he was displeased to hear such things, he like to hear aman get up and speak to say what he has to say to sayit without making excuses when the elders stand up toteach should do so by the aid and insperation of the Holy Ghost, minester and [Lansgware] trained to speak, HeSpoke of the stamina that is required to [recein] and live up to the truth, because of the unpopularity of the gospel,the world hates the saints as it did Jesus when he was omthe earth, The world deride the saints because they areoutspoken against wickedness and coruption, The Lordhad gathered up a people to serve him, and to assistin the building up of the Kingdom of God, The worldhas become infidel and becomign more so continually,The Christianity of the day in conection with its mini-sters have sone more to cause infidelity than all the writings ofProfessed Infidels put to geather, he refered to the greatevils that exists in the world, The Lord will hold agreat account against the elders of this generation,because of the great intelligence God has revealed to us, The heavens are watching over us, and all good men beyondthe veils are [soluntious] for our wefare, and are anxiousthat we shal prevail against all the evils that arebrought to bear against us, He spoke of the perminaryof this work because it was of and from God, if it wasof man could be easily prevailed against,  let thesaints then do their duty, adn make our probationeffectual, we lived before we came herein the presence of HeavenlyFather & Mother, It would not now to apostatise fromthe Truth, urged the completion of the Temple that wemay redeem the living and the dead, for God requiresthis at our hands, The world wonder and gaze at the eldersand this people they wonder more if God has a, hand init than he has not, he bore a faithful testimonyto the truth of this world, and assisted the triumphof this people, and Kingdom, and refered to themany who have come to an ignominious end whohave fought against this people, he exorted the saintsto be faithful to the end, and be saved in the Kingdomof God, and implored the blessings of God upon the Saints, 
 Pres. Wilford Woodruff , expressed himself appearinglyof the remarks of the former speaker, he spoke of the great change, & improvement which have beenwrought in a quarter of a century in these vallies ofthese mountains, he spoke of the great future thatis before the saintsjudging from the past what maywe expect to take place in the next 1/3/ of a century,to come he spoke of the unbelief of the age as [dlro] theinfidelity that is to be found in the world, he refered tothe remarks of Bro. Smith in regard to the propertraining of our children, and thought such remarkswere necessary for the benifit of the young and rising generation, he spoke of the responsibility resting upon thesaints, and again adverted to the great blessings that is every where manifest through out all Utah,hes spoke of the interposition of the almighty inpreserving the saints, and their crops, from theinsects that is here in this country, was glad tonote the increase of the faith ad good works amongthe saints & especially the young & urged the saints to educate & train their children and prepare themfor the work? that lie before them, 
 Pres Woodruff stated that he would not be justified in findingfault with the farmers for not attending meeting, as it is quite a busytime. Still no Latter Day Saint can be justified in working on the Sabbathday. This people are a good people. The treatment we have endured provethat we a good people. No other people would endure what we have enduredAs a people we are lied about more than any other people, that ever livedupon the earth. He spoke in commendation of the labors of the FemaleRelief Society as a great auxilliary in the Church & their laborsare felt & appreciated among the saints

 The Shoreham,Washington, D. C.,July 11, 1894.My dear Sir:Having at last reached success in the passage through Congress of the billadmitting Utah to Statehood, it is due to you to know something of the more importantdetails of the long and difficult contest. The victory which has been reached has comeonly through the help of friends whose services can never be forgotten, and through a patience and persistence of effort which I have never seen equalled.

As intelligent and Christian people, however, you have that quality which is themost divine in human nature, the quality of forgiveness; and as I have watched this struggle year after year and seen how strangely things have come out, how your enemies
