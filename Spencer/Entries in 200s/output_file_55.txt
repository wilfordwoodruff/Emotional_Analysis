We made a rough estimate of the amount that lay dead upon the shore of the Great Salt Lake last fall, having been washed ashore by the waves, as they dropped into the salt water, and we made over one million ^&amp; a half^ of bushels, at one time thoroughly salted through; they formed a complete belt around the whole Salt Lake shore, (the circumference of which is about 300 miles) several rods wide, and varying from six to eighteen inches deep. When they visit us in large bodies in the fall they deposit their eggs in the earth, and early the following spring they hatch out, and the earth is black with them. They eat up the wheat before they can fly, and leave the earth as bare as a turnpike road. We are much troubled this  season with the (so called) large tobacco worm upon the potatoe tops, and a cut worm at the roots, which are doing much damage to that crop; also with a worm about an inch long upon the ears of corn; they begin at the top end and eat the corn down the cob; this worm is annually with us, but worse than usual this season; the green measuring worms are destroying our cabbages and turnips very bad this season. We are now in the midst of our wheat harvest, and shall have a fair crop; but the drouth has destroyed a great quantity of crops of all kinds, as nearly all lands have to be irrigated in this county in order to secure a crop.

The weather for the past month has been excessively dry, with  the exception of some three showery days which was a great relief not  only to the saints but to vegetation; they gave a renewal of life and  vigor to all. The streams are comparatively dry, and we are bound  to acknowledge the hand of God in all things; for it is miraculous that  there is any wheat at all,  high, yet the ears being tolerably well filled.
