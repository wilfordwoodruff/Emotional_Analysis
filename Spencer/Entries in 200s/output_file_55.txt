Dear Brother:    Your letter calling me again as a  missionary to the Netherlands, was duly  received.    By my Maker's blessings, I will  be on hand, according to instruction,  at time and place required, to  leave as per appointment Nov. 4th, 1893.

 I am very desirous  of fulfilling an honorable  mission, and working  in the interest of the  kingdom of God.  I know  the Lord will bless me  and mine, if we serve  Him and keep his com-  mandments.    Will you inform me  of the fare, and the exact  time to leave Salt Lake  City?    What would be your  opinion as to my going  under the existing  circumstances?    Hoping to hear from  you soon, I remain  your brother in the  Gospel.    Lysander C. Pond    A. J. Cannon Bp over

 your Brother in the Gospel  Alexander Harris    Bp L S Pond    I think he should be released  from the call. Judging from  the spirit of his letter and   also from the character of  his writing, I should think  he might, perhaps, do more  good at home than he could  do abroad. If he were a  young^er^ man, he might improve  but such could hardly be  expected of him now.  J.F.S.

 Called for Scandinavia    Newton Oct. 16th [18]93    Pres. Woodruff.  Dear Brother,    I received your letter  rather by surprise.    I was called last april  of Brother Merril to full  a mission in the Logan  Tempel for one year and  have been there six   months, leaving six months  more.    I presented your letter to  the Bishop and he said  that they were unable to  help me, being that they  had sent two missionarys  this summer, and I am  unable to help my self at  presant. I would like to  fill the mission in the  Temple as long as I am   wanted there.

 the same instruction, that   Provo people were advised   to give visitors from out-  side settlements a chance   to attend the conferences in   Provo and hear the instructions  of the apostles.

A reply in writing would have   been sent to you in due course but for the fact that Elder B. H.   Roberts of your Church, called upon me and personally undertook to   convey to you a more full and satisfactory oral reply than could   be well committed to paper in a midst of the great pressure of the   World's Congress Work.    I thought he understood my position and that of Rev. Dr. John   Henry Barrows, Chairman of the General Committee on Religious Con-  gresses, and I also thought he concurred in that position.  I was   therefore very much surprised when I saw in the newspapers, without   any previous complaint on his part, a lengthy letter of censure of   the action taken by Dr. Barrows and myself.

Ass't Secretary, EUGENE J. HAZARD.    THE WORLD'S CONGRESS AUXILIARY   OF THE WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION.    CHICAGO,    Barrows, I did not think it proper to take anty formal notice of it.  I resolved, however, that after the close of the Congresses I  would address to you the present communication.    I explained to Elder Roberts, in the presence of a mutual   friend/ that there was not, nor ever had been, any desire on our   part to sit in judgment on the faith of the Mormon Church and to   discriminate against it; but that, as we all know, there had been   a long-standing and violent prejudice on the part of the general   American public against the Mormon Church and people on account of   their practice, or supposed practice of polygamy; and I seriously   feared that the admission of the Mormon Church into the Religious   Congresses of 1893 would re-excite that prejudice, and thereby   work great harm, even should we agree that the renunciation of   polygamy had been made and was kept in perfect good faith.  But I   said I was willing to receive a paper setting forth the faith and   progress of the Mormon Church, and to refer that paper to Dr.  Barrows, and the General Committee of which he was Chairman, for   such use as they might think proper; and I understood that such a   paper would be prepared and presented, by or through Elder Roberts.  This is all which I then thought, or have since felt, it would be   wise and just to do under all the circumstances of the case.    When I learned that Dr. Barrows, instead of reserving the

Dear Sir:    I have an opportunity to  sell my paper, The Nebraska Populist,  (sample copy in this mail).

My associates are two of the ablest  writers as well as all-around news-  paper men in Nebraska, and when  the question of statehood arises, we  can do you more good than perhaps

 1307 Pearl St.,  Sioux City, Ia., Oct. 30, 1893.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah,    Dear grandpa, I take the liberty to write you a few  lines with the hopes of ascertaining what the prospects would be for  me to obtain employment there as a stenographer or book-keeper if I  should decide to come out there this winter. I have a position here  with a commission merchant, but the compensation is less than I care  to work for, and as they pay more wages in the west I am thinking of  going to some good western city to locate, and write this to ascertain  what advantages your city offers to a young man who is willing to work  for what he gets and is anxious to make his mark in the world.    Trusting that I am not intruding on your valuable time, and that  I may hear from you in the near future, I remain as ever,    Your grandson,  Geo. Scholes    P.S. The financial situation in Sioux City is rapidly return-  ing to its old basis, and the Banks are beginning to loan money on good  collaterals, and everything points toward prosperity the coming year.

CHICAGO,    paper for publication, if thought best, had gone so much further as   to consent to its public presentation in a branch of the World's   Parliament of Religions, known as the Scientific Section, I was   surprised, because I then thought and still think that in so doing   he had done more than the very best interests of all concerned   would warrant.    But while I was surprised at this liberal action on the part   of Dr. Barrows, I was much more astonished by the refusal of Elder   Roberts to read his paper there, and his complaining because he was   not invited to read it in one of the general sessions of the Par-  liament.    I will add, by way of further explanation, that, strictly   speaking, your application came too late.  The work of organization   of the World's Congresses of 1893 was commenced in October 1889.  General proclamations of the proposed Congresses were widely pub-  lished throughout the world, inviting the cooperation of appropriate  organizations.  Applications from such organizations were re-  ceived from time to time while the Congresses of the different De-  partments were in course of organization.  The World's Congress  season commenced on May 15th 1893, and in strictness, no applica-  tion made after the first of that month was entitled to considera-  tion.  Nevertheless, as far as was practicable, applications made
