A reply in writing would have been sent to you in due course but for the fact that Elder B. H. Roberts of your Church, called upon me and personally undertook to convey to you a more full and satisfactory oral reply than could be well committed to paper in a midst of the great pressure of the World's Congress Work.I thought he understood my position and that of Rev. Dr. John Henry Barrows, Chairman of the General Committee on Religious Con-gresses, and I also thought he concurred in that position.  I was therefore very much surprised when I saw in the newspapers, without any previous complaint on his part, a lengthy letter of censure of the action taken by Dr. Barrows and myself.  As that letter was published in the newspapers without presentation to me or to Dr.

HAZARD.THE WORLD'S CONGRESS AUXILIARY OF THE WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION.CHICAGO,Barrows, I did not think it proper to take anty formal notice of it.I resolved, however, that after the close of the Congresses Iwould address to you the present communication.I explained to Elder Roberts, in the presence of a mutual friend/ that there was not, nor ever had been, any desire on our part to sit in judgment on the faith of the Mormon Church and to discriminate against it; but that, as we all know, there had been a long-standing and violent prejudice on the part of the general American public against the Mormon Church and people on account of their practice, or supposed practice of polygamy; and I seriously feared that the admission of the Mormon Church into the Religious Congresses of 1893 would re-excite that prejudice, and thereby work great harm, even should we agree that the renunciation of polygamy had been made and was kept in perfect good faith.  But I said I was willing to receive a paper setting forth the faith and progress of the Mormon Church, and to refer that paper to Dr.Barrows, and the General Committee of which he was Chairman, for such use as they might think proper; and I understood that such a paper would be prepared and presented, by or through Elder Roberts.This is all which I then thought, or have since felt, it would be wise and just to do under all the circumstances of the case.When I learned that Dr. Barrows, instead of reserving the
