I realize the Samoans have souls to save the same as the English or Germans.  Will be in Salt Lake City on the 15th or 16th of July to be set apart for my mission in con- nection with Bro. Provo.

Petty deceased was referred to me by President Brigham  Young, to investigate and decide and settle.  Therefore I would hereby say that inasmuch as Robert C. Petty did consecrate all that he possessed before leaving on his mission, and whereas Margaret Petty is his legal wife for time and Eternity, and has seven children to support; and whereas Mary Adelia Northrop Petty is a proxy  case, and has left the fort and gone to her Father's home and taken with her three head of cattle, it is my decision and council that the 10 acres of land, cattle, sheep, or any  other consecrated property which now remains, should not  be sold for the support of Mary Adelia Northrop Petty, but that Margaret D.

Pratt had left this city for Europe before its arrival; otherwise I have no doubt but he would have taken pleasure in answering it. I have examined your letter carefully, and also your Report which came by the same mail, and I consider the cause in which you are engaged a very worthy and laudable undertaking, and one of great benefit to every  country, nation, or territory. I will take pleasure in rendering any assistance in my power in this matter. We have many friend's who go from our city to the States and Europe in the capacity of Delegates, Missionaries, Agents, Merchants andc, by whom I could send to your address such insects as you desire from time to time. We have some very fine bearing orchards in this city and territory, and we think it will be a good countrry for fruit. Governor Young has the best orchard in the Territory, and it is producing finely, especially the Peaches, Apples, and Grapes. I have a fine orchard of 50 Apple trees, 75 Peach, 20 Plum, 25 Quince, and 30 grape vines, nearly all in bearing, and doing well. I have examined my trees and vines with a magnifier since I obtained your letter, and I find them very free generally of those destructive insects of which you treat in your Report. I have however found some.

We made a rough estimate of the amount that lay dead upon the shore of the Great Salt Lake last fall, having been washed ashore by the waves, as they dropped into the salt water, and we made over one million ^and a half^ of bushels, at one time thoroughly salted through; they formed a complete belt around the whole Salt Lake shore, (the circumference of which is about 300 miles) several rods wide, and varying from six to eighteen inches deep. When they visit us in large bodies in the fall they deposit their eggs in the earth, and early the following spring they hatch out, and the earth is black with them. They eat up the wheat before they can fly, and leave the earth as bare as a turnpike road. We are much troubled this  season with the (so called) large tobacco worm upon the potatoe tops, and a cut worm at the roots, which are doing much damage to that crop; also with a worm about an inch long upon the ears of corn; they begin at the top end and eat the corn down the cob; this worm is annually with us, but worse than usual this season; the green measuring worms are destroying our cabbages and turnips very bad this season. We are now in the midst of our wheat harvest, and shall have a fair crop; but the drouth has destroyed a great quantity of crops of all kinds, as nearly all lands have to be irrigated in this county in order to secure a crop.

I have written to you almost every mail for the  last three years, and I have received but few letters from  you during the last year, and it seems you do not get  near all of mine.  We learn by the Mail from our Delegates at  Washington that the political Horison, Health of the Nation  and friendship for Utah is very dark and gloomy, but it  is all right with me, there is a God that will guide the  storm unto the end, and will pay every man and nation  their just due; and I feel thankful for this, I would rather  be in the position of Utah and receive her reward than  to be in the position and receive the reward of many others.

Neither your family nor myself received and  thing from the Mill, or bro Houtz—we are both out of flour—I furnished Mrs Bernhisel with flour as long as I had it. I am now cutting my wheat—may be some 300 bushels: as soon as I can get it thrashed I will supply her what the Mill does not, but it seems to be a pinching time at present. Sister Bernhisel has laid the matter before President Young, and informed him that Bro Houtz does not furnish him with anything, so she says, and told him that if he does not do his duty in the matter he will attend to his case. Mr Houtz takes a strange course in relation to your business.  Sister Bernhisel is well—she was at my house to day.  We are in the midst of harvest: there will be a great deal of wheat cut this season in the Territory; but it will require a great deal of care to save it all, or we shall be worse distressed before another harvest than we ENDENTRY Historian's Office Great Salt Lake City August 30th 1856  Hon J. M. Bernhisel  Dear Sir,  Our wheat harvest is in, and we begin to have bread again. Bro. Houtz has began to bring flour again to your family, and also some to me, (224 lbs) but as long as he could sell it at a high price, he was careful not to let either of us have any. I have not seen him of late. Money is getting very scarce in this  Territory, there is but little in circulation. Your thrashing machine is in operation; I expect to employ it in about a week to thrash 3 or 400 bushels of wheat. Your family are all well. I have had your wood cut up of late, and your oxen have began to draw some (2 loads) I hope they will continue.  It is a general time of health with us in this Territory. I think the wheat has come in quite good throughout most of the Territory; corn looks tolerably well; potatoes appear quite a light crop. I have cut both the samples of wheat and corn you sent me from the Patent office: the wheat got ripe in 90 days, it is the California Bearded Wheat, a little Taos in it got ripe in 85 days; the Bearded Wheat is not near as profitable as the Taos a Club.

To Elder Fort Herriman  This is to inform you that Sister Margaret Petty called to see President Young upon the subject of settling her estate. President Young has requested me to hear her  case and settle it. I have heard her testimony upon the  subject, but have not heard the testimony of Mary Adelia, not having the opportunity of seeing her. From the information which I have obtained upon the subject, my decision and  council would be as follows:  That whereas Elder Robert C. Petty did consecrate his land, cattle, and all that he possessed to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints before he started on  his Mission; and inasmuch as Margareth Petty has seven children to support, and is his legal and lawful wife, for time  and eternity; and inasmuch as there is but 10 acres of land under improvement, and whereas Mary Adelia is a proxy case for time, and has left and gone home to her friends, and taken three head of cattle with her.  In consideration of these things my council would be  that there be no land, or cattle, or any thing else that was consecrated sold for the benefit of Mary Adelia Northrop, more than what she has obtained, but that Mrs Margaret Petty have the  stewardship of what remains for the support of herself and children.  W.

We heard but little from our handcart emigration, or any of the back Companies. Philemon C. Merrill and  company arrived on the 16th inst; as far as we could learn all well. I had an interview with Dr J. Clinton who was well and in good spirits.  The weather has continued dry since we last wrote. Our wheat harvest is gathered and proved to be a much better crop than we could have expected, consi- dering the drouth; the heads were well filled even where the wheat was so short that it had to be pulled, which has been the case with many acres this season. Our corn crop looks quite well. The potatoe crop is nearly a failure, they mostly run to vines. Beets and garden vegetables look well. This season is not our peach bearing year, ENDENTRY those destructive insects.  Yours respectfully, W. Woodruff  My address is  Wilford Woodruff, Historian's Office, Great Salt Lake City, U.T. ENDENTRY Historians office G. S. L. city 30 Augt. 1856  Ed. of the Luminary  Dear Sir,  Since writing to you last month the weather has continued dry and favorable for harvesting. The Wheat in many instances has filled out in the ear; much better that possibly could be expected, the stalks in many fields averaging over 1 foot in height; potatoes in the city are almost an entire failure, tho' in the Settlements and on the farm- ing lands there will be a moderate crop. Beets are doing well so far as we have heard; altogether we shall reap a much more abundant harvest than the drouth could have allowed us to anticipate.  Many bushels of currants have been raised in the city this season, and as I was the chairman of the awarding committee on  Fruit appointed by the Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society, I had the opportunity of seeing many beautiful specimens, considering that the currants have generally been brought wild from the kanyons,  and very few as yet been raised from the seed. We consider currants  very well adapted for our climate. A few ripe apricots and plums have also been exhibited. Several beds of strawberries have yielded abundantly. Prof. Carrington had a seedling peach tree which bore a few peaches this season which were ripe on the 23rd. curt. He has a very fine bearing peach or- chard. We are budding extensively from several of the best varieties of apples and peaches which have been brought from the States. I will have about 400 buds put in this season in my own orchard of apples, peaches, apricots, plums and almonds. I will have a few good apples this season also a few bunches of Grapes. It is the first season that my orchard has commenced bearing. Prest. Youngs orchard is bearing well this season and I would judge his young vineyard would produce more than a ton of grapes.  ENDENTRY A company returned from Carson Valley last evening—rather dull times there; they report Reddin (I think brother to Jack Reddin) killed by the Indians. I think Murray was  the one tried last winter for Murder.  Our wheat crops have come in quite well; corn looks middling well; Potatoes have mostly run to tops this season—I think the  crop will be light.  Brother Isaac Chase is quite sick with a fever, and brother Thurston has been very sick of late with rheumatism, but is  getting better.  As concerning Fruit I would say President Young will have, I think, 20, or 30.00 lbs of Grapes; some apple trees hang full, and a middling crop of peaches. I have some very large fine seedling apples, 1/2 bushel of plums, a fair crop of peaches andc. Your trees are growing very well, I have  trimmed them some. We have about 20 different kinds of  apples from the States now growing in this Valley, which  we are spreading as fast as we can.  I have sent a list of fruit to the Hon J. M. Bernhisel to procure for us at the Linnaean Gardens and Nursery of New York—about 50 kinds of fruit for the benefit of our Territory.  Your family are all well.

ENDENTRY Great Salt Lake City, July 31st 1856  To the Editor of the Luminary,  Dear Sir,  Another month of hard times has rolled into eternity, and I again renew my correspondence with you. The drouth of the summer  has been mercifully relieved by 3 or 4 pleasant thunder showers during  the past week, which has proved a blessing to the crops, for the corn now looks a little more pleasant, the shriveled leaves uncurling themselves  finely, and the farmers feel a little more cheerful than they did a fortnight ago.  The prospects are decidedly gloomy, many fields of wheat are not  a foot high, and the tobacco worm and caterpillar have swept many fields of potatoes in various locations. The corn in many places is  infested with a grub which destroys the grain while in its milky tender condition, and to crown the entire calamities, Jack Frost came on the 23rd June and nipt the corn and potatoes; and then as if to make sure work he came again on the nights of July 16th and 17th, and  left his marks more plain on the corn and potatoes, the squash, and  cane grass.  About 3 weeks since G. S. L. City was visited by a flight of grasshoppers which fortunately did not remain any considerable length of time.  Although the above is somewhat a gloomy prospect, still we are cheered by the harvesters cutting down their wheat, where it is sufficiently ripe. In addition to the hand labor, we have in the territory two of  McCormick's reapers which give entire satisfaction to some, whilst others do not like them much. The people are most anxious to secure wheat  enough for themselves; and those who have a portion above their necessities, ENDENTRY Historian's office G. S. L. City Augt. 30, 1856  Ed. of the Mormon,  Dear Sir,  The Eastern mail arrived on the evening of the  28th, inst., bringing Mormons up to the 12th July—considerable news  from our Washington delegation, and the Eastern country.  The weather continues dry and favorable for harvesting. Our  wheat crops have proved much better than we had estimated on ac- count of the drouth, and the scanty supply of water from the creeks.  Potatoes in the city on the higher land are genererally a failure; on the  lower and Farming lands, there are moderate crops; having mostly  grown to tops. Corn crops in many places look well. We probably  will reap a much larger amount of grain than possibly could have  been calculated upon during the dry summer. The wheat has filled  remarkably well out in the ear notwithstanding the stalks were so  small that in many instances the Farmers have had to pull  their grain instead of cutting it.  The health of the people during the past season has been  remarkably good.  During this month Elder Parley P. Pratt and a few  bretheren have been appointed on missions to the States. Thomas Bullock, Europe. They expect to start on or about the 10th of Sep.  On the 10th curt. the first division of Elder P. C.

We have sent for some before, but the person instead of putting them in a  tin box and soldering it up air tight, put them in a wooden box, and they all spoiled, except those that had been sent  in a tin box, which had kept good. I wish when you get them that you would direct the box to me, and then put one or two papers in it with directions on each, so that if one gets worn out another may remain, and send it to me: this is by the request of the Agricultural and Manufacturing Society it is for the benefit of the whole Territory; whatever the expense is please let me know, and charge it to me, and I will pay all expenses. I wish to have each package of cuttings marked so that I can know what kind of fruit it is when it comes. I shall also write to Wm R. Prince andCo, upon the the subject.  The Eastern Mail arrived on the 28th. I received letters from you and President till 1/2 past 10 o'clock hearing the Washintgton and other letters read; your joint letter to President Young shows the dark state of the political Horizon; all right, there is a God in Israel who will guide the storm and pay every man and Nation their just due; and may God Almighty hasten it is my prayer; the words of Joseph, Brigham and the prophets are fulfuilling. ENDENTRY Great Salt Lake City, July 31st, 1856  To the Editor of the Mormon,  Dear Sir,  In the midst of the hurry of harvest we devote a short time to write you a few items of what is transpiring in this blest Territory. It is well known to all the civilized world that we are located in the  valleys of the great American Basin, some portions of the rim rising  from eleven to sixteen thousand feet above the level of the sea; therefore  we are isolated from "the rest of the mankind," having but little communication with the world, for if our friends write to us, it is a risk whether the letters come to this city or not, and therefore as a general thing we have nobody  to write to. The weather for the past month has been excessively dry, with  the exception of some three showery days which was a great relief not  only to the saints but to vegetation; they gave a renewal of life and  vigor to all. The streams are comparatively dry, and we are bound  to acknowledge the hand of God in all things; for it is miraculous that  there is any wheat at all, fmany fields of it not having grown a foot  high, yet the ears being tolerably well filled. The potatoes too are in  many places cut down to the earth by an army of caterpillers and  tobacco worms; the drouth in other places causes the vines to wilt, and  on examination there are no potatoes at the roots.  In addition to all these calamities, Jack Frost visited the low lands  on the 23rd June, and as though he really thought the people did not  believe he could come on the shortest night of the year, he visited many  fields of corn, potatoes, and vines on the nights of the 16th and 17th July, and left his icy mark wherever he went, for vegitation wilted under his  rude embrace.

City Sept 4th 1856.  Editor of the Standard  Dear Sir,  The Eastern Mail arrived on the evening of the 28th ult, Bringing letters and papers from our delegates in Washington andc, which gave us a general account of the of the state of the political atmosphere, and the general news of the day. The California mail arrived on the 1st inst; bringing us the "Standard" up to July 26th, and other papers  and letters from our western friends. It is truly a treat to us to hear once a month what is going on in the lower world,  East, West, North and South. We truly feel to bid you God speed in your noble effort in lifting up and maintaining  a "Standard" in the West; and we pray the Lord to raise  you up friends and means that you may be sustained  in so worthy an undertaking; for having been very freely represented for twenty years, in many parts of the world,  we now esteem it a great blessing to have the privilege of representing ourselves. We men find a slight difference between being represented by friends or enemies, especially  as the Latter Day Saints.  We did not hear by the last mail much from our Young has sent out teams with a large amount of flour, to meet them.  It is a general time of health throughout our Territory.

We wish to be remembered to you.  As Ever, I remain Yours truly,  W Woodruff ENDENTRY will be very careful to store it away. They are also in hopes that the  corn and potatoes will yet turn out pretty good, so that all saints who come to the valleys this fall may be sustained.  One blessing has been conferred upon us by some apostates who left here for St. Louis this spring, and reported their doleful tales to all the Emigrants who are bound for the gold mines; which caused them to take the cut off east of Bridger's Fort. By this means the great droves of cattle which would otherwise have thronged our streets, and used up all the grass in the neighborhood of the city and the northern settlements, have passed by.  If they had come this way it would of necessity have caused the citizens to have sent their cattle eight miles for feed; we are thankful for even this small favor.  The 24th July was passed by the Presidency and a select company up at the head waters of the Big Cottonwood Creek, several thousand feet above  the valley; they had a splendid and agreeable time, the particulars of  which you will see in the Deseret News of 30th July. Those present were  invited ^by Prest Young^ to meet again at 4 p.m of the 23rd July 1857 at the same place,  together with such others as he may invite. He expressed himself that it was the freest, happiest celebration he has participated in, as no formality had been manifested on the occasion, and every person felt well.  You will be sorry to hear that the milk weeds have taken almost universal possesion of that portion of your farm on the west side of and adjoining the State road, and most of the trees that you had caused to be planted are destroyed by the cattle grazing there breaking them down, or by wagons being driven against them by careless drivers.  We are not experiencing such excessive, unbearable hot weather this summer as yet, although it has been very dry with the exception of three or four days. The people are generally enjoying good health, and all are in good spirits and cheerful. ENDENTRY Gardening implements, Manufactures, Ladies work, Machinery and Fruits.

The community are fast becoming unable to sustain the merchants in importing such heavy trains of goods and merchandize, and are thereby becoming  obliged to foster our own manufacturers and mechanics,  who are abundantly able, if encouraged, to compete with  the imported merchandize.

I herewith send you the names of eight, but I have learned since the names were entered upon the blank that Bro. Niels Johnson is not in  financial circumstances to go, I have not spoken with him or any of the brethren as it has been my instructions not to do so, but there being a space in the  blanks for the information as to the time they will be ready to go I see that some of the Bishops have spoken  with the brethren and incerted that information.  Now in endorsing these brethren for missions I  do it entirely upon the recommendation of their Bishops and what I can learn incidently about them  Without meeting them and talking with them this is the best I can do. I have always tried to be as careful as possible to get worthy men for missionaries but in most cases I have to depend upon the word of the Bishops, and if the Bishop does not communicate directly with the men themselves he is not able to indorse ENDENTRY Edward J.
