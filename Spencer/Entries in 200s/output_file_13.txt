 they were suffered therefore to be forbid; and in ##Exodus 28:4|Exod. Chapt. 28##, saying these are the garments which they shall make,this they say excludes all that are not here named, & Mosesbeing commanded at the burning bush to put offhis shoes, for the ground on which he stood was Holy,for the same reason— because of the extryaordinarypresence of God then in that place, they make a furtherargument for it. [##Exodus 3:5##] For say they, the Temple was all Holy,for the same reason, that is because of the extraordinarypresence of God, then residing in the Shekinah over theMercy Seat, (this was the sacred name) & for furtherreasons, it was most strictly exacted, that the priest should^be^ always barefoot in the Temple, but the Jews & eastern Nationsuncover their feet, that no dust or pollution might profane the Holy ground. [##1 Kings 8:10-11##] Herne [Herein] pulling off a shoe amongthe ancients, indicated reverence for the presence of God.The customs was also expressive of the covenant of a bargain,or covenant amongst the eastern nations; the partyconveying away a right or privilege, took off a shoe &gave it to his fellow, as a pledge of his fidelity.Amongst the Jews it was a token of renunciation, thus thekinsman of Ruth renounced his claim upon her infavor of Boaz; she loosed his shoe from his foot to showshe was released from all engagements by which the lawsof the country, had bound her to the claims of her nearestrelations &c, &c.

 Franklin, Idaho, June 18 1889Pres. Wif^l^ford Woodruff.Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Bro:Your favor notifing methat I have been called toleave Salt Lake City on Aug. 14th;for Great Britian on a missionis at hand and noted.In reply I have but tosay that with the help of the Lord I will be on hand asper your instructionsYour Bro. in the Gosple,Chas. EnglandS. S. Hatch Bishop 
 Their are things in Embrio which will try this people & those Events will ripen as theis dPeople do and all will have to get the spirit & Revelations of Heaven in order to stand, & thes things will be among all Nations &know it as well as I knew it would be a hard winter. I want youto wake up yourselves & then wake up your wives & Children & stop your lying & stealing & take that Burthen upon your Backs which belong to you then thePresidency & Twelve will ownly carry their own burthens. The time has comeor is near at hand when many that have trifled with the priesthood & thethings of God will be destroyed & go to Hell cross lots & those who arenot faithful in magnifying the priesthood it will be taken from them& given to others and that quickly and I know it for Angels, Prophets,& Holy men say it & it will be fulfilled.As to danceing I am tiered of itI never want to see another man dance untill he can do it by the power ofGod. I felt that spirit once & Brother Brigham shouted Hosanna for we wasboth filled with the spirit Neither do I want to see any more feasting at present. I dont want to see any more Jealous feelings some ofour Bishops get Jealous of the servants of God no man would be ifHe was filled with the Holy Ghost. I would chastize a man if He stood in my way when I knew that I am a messenger sent of God. President Young says if the people do not do right He will not stay long withthem but shall go the other side of the veil if He goes I shall notstay long behind him because we will not have one between us and if you dont do your duty we shall go soon I have had manymen try to stand between me & president Young & when I havebeen to see him many have snubed me but I have seen enough of this. And that man that will try to do it He must look out for God & his angels will smite him. I have no objection to men coming to President Young to comfort him & do him good & whenhe gives them a wife give him $10 or $20 dollars according as Hemay value his wife. But men must not try to separate us if they do they will be cursed I understood that Brother Woodruff got a whiping from one of them lately But I tell you that althoughHe is a small man He is all gold & you will find it so in the end& you may be thankful to ever get as good a place as He will get for he is the pure gold & I wish you would get as good as He isthe Bishops will not repeat what the missionaries say for theyare Jealous. But if you will get the spirit of God upon you there will be no Jealous feelings in your heart. you want the spirit of God & the power of the priesthood to rest upon you as it did upon Joseph & does upon the Presidency & Twelve. take that priesthoodupon you which belongs to you & magnify it. The Missionariswant to wake up then wake up the Bishops & then wake up the people & all live your religion & all will go well and if you will live up to your priviliges here & get the spirit of this refermation it will reach all over the Earth & go to the ends of the Earth & the wicked will not have power over us but this work will go from Zion throughall the world as the sap of a tree will go from the trunk to the end of evry limb & twig. I want to see the power of God among this people that they may have faith to remove mountains if necessary but the power of God will ownly increase as the spirit of God increases among the peopleif we will do our duty ^&^ if the United [States] should be the aggressers the Lord would say if they came against us Let my servant Brigham send 200 men & they would lick them up, for God would assist to fight ourBattles with the storm hail & snow, & they would be destroyed. I knowthis would be done but we must get the faith of the Ancients 
 As to Brother Brigham Young I have to say that He is just as good a man asever was on Earth. Now wake up Brethren & see that you purifyyourselves before you try to purify others then go forth & lift up yourvoice like a trumpet & call upon all men to repent get full of theHoly Ghost & there is not a man that will do it but what will be filledwith Prophesyings as were the ancient Nephites, and little Boys 4 yearsold will prophesiey. I do not wish to go to a feast or a dance until thispeople reform. and when there is men enough here to bring forththis refermation & men will not prosper untill they do their dutyto God & each other. I have no desire to attend any recreation untillthis people are filled with the spirit & power of God & I do notthink that President Young has. if you will rise up & do your dutyyou will be blessed & no man that rises up against us in this placewill prosper if we do our duty & we wash our feet against themI believe in washing our feet against our Enemies.

In answer to the question of Brother Savage about people restoring what they hav stolen {from [illegible]} in the first place I would say I would not steal but whare it cannot berestored I would say put it into the P[erpetual] E[migration] Fund to gather poor for I would not have any thing to do with it A.

I refered to the Blessings of presidents Youngs family soon Presidents Young came in & addressed the people for half an hour or more the following is a synopsis of his remarks 
 [FIGURES] A synopsis of President B Youngs remarks Before the 18 ward Jan 11th 1857the following is not recorded or reported in any other place It is wright that we should meet together often to pray sing preach teach & recieve instruction in order to assist us to live our religion, but none of thes things or any of the ordinances of the gospel which we admin-ister to the children of men or to each other does not benefit the Lord Our worshiping the Lord is of no particular benefit to our Father in Heaven but it is all entirely for our own benefit & in this light we should view it. their is a doctrin taught from the stand & freequently taught in Public that we should follow Brother Joseph or Brother Brighamor any man who leads & do as they say & obey them & that is all that is required but this is a fals doctrin in one sense. for I will say that no man should trust to the testimony of another but he should go to God & get the testimony for himself this evry man & woman should do I might have heard Joseph Smith preache & testify of the truth of the Book of mormon & of this work untill he had been as old as Methuselah & in the end I should have snaped my fingers at him & said to him you are a foolish old man & turned upon my heels & walked off if I had not have had some other testimony besides his but I went to the Lord & the Lord revealed to me that it was true & that it was his word & I received it upon that principle, & I have lived upon that principle from that day untill now & it is the right privilege & Duty of evry man & woman to get the revelation of Jesus Christ for themselves & evry person should get the spirit of God & live by it & if all would do this there would not be a man or woman unhappy in this territory & the flood of complaint which now salutes my ears of Husbands & wives complaining of each other would be done away. One man comes & sayes my family will not be subject to me another woman says my husband abuses me & I want a bill to get away from him and a thousand complaints come poreing in upon me none of which I should hear if the people lived by the spirit of God you should all obtain the spirit of God & overcome your passions when you get angry you should put a peace of Indiaruber in your mouth & bite it untill you could get perfect controll over your passion do not speak while you are angry for you will say sumthing that you will be sorry for but if you will keep your thoughts to yourself when you are angry they will not become the property of another. Any person who is acquainted with me knows that I have controll over myself I do not speak in anger to my wives, children or the people. I make all my Passions be in subjectionto the priesthood & the spirit of God. people cannot fulfill their calling & do their duty unless they are filled with the Holy GhostI do not know that there is a female in Israel who is worthy of the appellation of a Mother in Israel for any woman to raise up children unto the Lord as they should do they should be filled with the Holy Ghost when they concieve seed & continue filled with the Holy Ghost untill the child is born & weaned then the Mother should have the Holy Ghost to teach the child untill He is Grown up so the Father should be filled with the Holy Ghost when he begetts a child & he also should be filled with the Holy Ghost in order to train up that child right then it will be Holy unto the Lord & will have power with God. these are true principles. the saints should bring all there passions in subjections to the Law of God I am learning evry day I live, I see some that will bear a testimony that they know that Joseph was a prophet 
 & the Book of Mormon is true & this work is of God & yet if any thing is said that comes contrary to their selfish dispositions they will manifest the most stoubern will & will not yield one hair from what their wicked dispositions dictate. I see it in families one will growl because onedrops a mop at their door or does sumthing that does not please them they have no disposition to do any thing ownly for their own Gratification but this is not right you should feel like this what can I do to help you I am not above helping my neighbor, do you want your shoes blackedI will black them I am not to good to do it this is the way you should feel for the Lord will reward you according to your work. their are many in this Territory who are miserable why because they have not the spirit of God they do wrong & get into the dark but no person should be miserable who has received the Holy Gospel they should be happy all the time day & night many other remarks was made which iare not now brought to my mindJanuary 12, 1857 ~ Monday12th I spent the day in the Legislature & attended meeting with the seventies O Hyde W.

Kimballcame in & soon President Young came in & it created a great sensation among the people for it was the first time he had been seen in the Tabernacle since the day that J. M. Grant was buried.

He was followed by H. C. Kimball & D. H. Wells who spoke in an Edifying manner all will be printed in the Deseret News. I attended the prayer Circle in the evening when I arived there I saw a large company of men & women coming out of the Presidents office. He had been sealing men & women from the close of the meeting up to that time & had to turn away many which he could not attend to I Preached in the evening at the 2nd ward school house A Cordon spoke also Brother Tune & Bishop Hill. I then spoke about one hour & had the spirit of God upon me & the people with myself were edifyedFebruary 2, 1857 ~ Monday2nd I spent the day in the office writing letters I attended the seventies meeting & had a good time the spirit of the Lord waswith us the meeting was addressed by Elders Rockwood & Hancock a short time then followed by Elder Lorenzo Snow & W. Woodruff. Elder Snows mind run in a vary interesting channel the spiritual atmosphere seemed to be heavy when he ^a^rose but the spirit of God came upon him & he spoke in a vary edefying & interesting manner the following remarks werElder snow was written from memeryBrethren I rise to occupy a short time I realize that there is a feeling with nearly all of this people that there is sumthing of great importance awateing this people some think that we will be beset by a great mob from the states others that we would have an insurrection in our mids[t] & others sumthing Els now of [if] the people really knew that we would be met by a mob & that our lives depended upon our being well armed you wouldsee this people sell their coat or shirt to buy revolvers & weapons so as to defend their wives children & their own lives but I am satisfyed that there are scenes awaiting this people that will require all the grace & wisdom which we can muster to pass through in safety. now for instance this people are makeing a great rush to President Youngs office to get wives sealed to them on sunday night President Young sealed men & women till it was time for the prayer circle to meet then He had to turn a roomfull out of Doors to wait another time this spirit is increasing throughout this Territory now do those who are taking so many wives realize that it will want a great Deal more power with God the Holy Ghost & wisdomto preside over that Houshold than it does to go to the nations & preachthe gospel, build up Churches & organize them & preside over & controll them, if they do not realize it it is true, now here is this great body of seventies & every other Quorum of this church should labour hard to arm yourselves with all the power of God you can get in order to save your families if you do not if you do not you will soon find a stamped[e] with your wives you cannot hold them they will break from you you I need the wisdom of the Gods to rest upon you to save your families for if you do not have great wisdom you will meet with trouble. you have many wives & children this woman 
 wants a gown that one a Bonnet the next one shoes & their children clothing & one thinks she Has to do more than her part & this one will not do what she should &c & the man has got to stand in the midst of his family like a God in order to calm the troubled waters & safe them. A man may Go to a ward meeting & preach & the power of God is upon him he comes home he finds one woman scolding & freting another one in tearess, another one complaining & the children fighting & by the time he gets well in the midst of it hith faith courage & patience almost fails him, & he has to rise up in the majesty of a God as it were & have Great wisdom faith & patience & exercise much Generalship & show himself a master spirit & a savior & a Fatherly care & kind ness in order to save his wives & children. Here is a mission for you ye Elders of Israel. Look for instance at the example of president Young go into his house & take lessons see him with his great family of wives & children & se the God like character & exam-ple of that man & the order which he manifests in his family I tell you if it was not so you would see a stampede suddenly in that House but He is a great master spirit & manifests great wisdom in the perfect order of Government with his numerous family of wives & children, they all respect him & obey his law for the wisdom of God is with him. Now brethren strive to bring yourselves to the same standard become a patriarch over your own Household & seek to save them connected with order you have to become a financere & you have to support your wives & children & you want to live so that you can call upon God to increase your flock heards & crops this brethren is the greater work which you have to prepare your minds for almost any fool can go & preach the gospel but it requires a vary wise man to be a patriarch & save his own household. Many other interesting remarks were made which I have not room here to recordW Woodruff followed & said I have been much instructed with the word of Elder Snow his words are true as the gospel & I bear testimony of its truth I am watching the spirits of men we come & meet with the seventies and with all other Quorums of the church from the 12 down & watch the spirits & give instruction as the spirit dictates this is not ownly our right &but duty Here is before me a vast body of 70sseventies the minds of this body of men must be fed your presidents should be filled with the spirit & power of God so that they can attend all the meetings & feed them & give unto them the mind & will of God if they do not do this they will die & cannot stand for the minds of these seventies must be fed but many of them who have been ordained into these Quorms have not prized the prieshhood which they have had sealed upon them many times they have been so anxious to go & attend to some trifling thing that they could not stop long enough to be ordained at least as soon as the hands were off they would run & not stop to give their genealogy many of the Elders of this Church have trifled with the priesthood. there is now a call made to gather up all the Elders priests Teachers & Deacons that are ^not^ esspecially ingaged as teachers with the Bishops to come forward & be ordained into the seventies now it does appear to me that the Lesser priesthood is necessary in the church otherwise the Lord would not have esstablished it. the Headd cannot say to the feet we have no need of you no more than the feet can say to the head we have no need of you. almost all the Lesser priesthood are striveing to become ordained into the seventies while the bishops wish them to officiate in the Lesser priesthood. * see the star on the other page 
 February 3, 1857  ~ Tuesday3rd I spent the day in the office writing Letters to correspondence &c I attended the Bishops meeting in the evening at the seventies Hall we had a good meeting Bishop Hunter spoke followed by Lorenzo Snow who preached nearly the same sermon that he did last night to the 70s meeting I followed him & bore testimony to the truth of what he had said I was followed by Bishops Hardy & LittleFebruary 4, 1857 ~ Wednesday4th [FIGURES] I finished my Letters to my correspondence I I wrote 6 Letters to the Mormon, Standard, Star, G. A. Smith J M. Bernhisel & Lyman & Rich the Calafornia Mail arived at abut 2 oclok it brought the standard Mormon & some Letters not much news it also brought the star. I spent the evening at the office with with L Snow & F. D. Richards in conversation & had a plesant interview together. [FIGURE] I received two papers of pear & Apple pie mellon seeds from C C RichFebruary 5, 1857 ~ Thursday5th A snowey day. I spent a part of the day writing & reading I attended a trial before the High Counsel & 13 ward of Brother Capaner that was cut off from the Church after Hearing the testimony of both parties & remarks from the councellors & decision of president Spenser, then President Young delivered an address to the people a synopsis of which was taken by Brother Bolton delivered to me & filed in the Historians office. He said a Bishop & his councillors might cut off a man from the church whether any of the ward voted or not He said should the people follow a Bishop yes if he is a righteous man & does right but if he teaches wrong things & does wrong the people should not follow Him but when this is the case let the people thunder out the truth as it is then the bishop will see it butunless the people can point out some better way let them followthe bishop. see Boltons report* (From the back page) The Bishops feel to complain & say the seventies take all of the Lesser priesthood which we have & ordain them seventies so by the time we get some teachers organized they are ordained to the office of seventies. The seventies also complain that the Bishops come & take away their presiding officers & the seventies & make bishops & councellors of them & ordain them High priest so their appears to be a difference of feeling in the several Quorums in order to avoid this I would recommend that the Teachers Priest & Deacons all that the Bishops wish to make use of as teachers in theseveral Quorum remain as they are untill they have magnifyed their calling & not evry man as soon as he is ordained a teacher go & get ordained a seventy & hide himself in that mighty forest of men so that He cannot be found For the seventies are like a forest trees of all kinds from the tallest down to the shrubery & men get lost in such a forest men should not despise the lesser priest-hood for it is honorable & if they fully magnify that office they will have great power & many blessings for the Aaronic priesthood hold the keys of administering of Angels & their has been but fewmen even High Priest or Apostles that have enjoyed all the blessings that belongs to the Lesser priesthood. Then Let not the seventies seek to get all the Lesser priesthoods ordained into ther quorums if they do I do not wish them to complain if seventies are taken out to Make Bishops councillors & teachers of them as long as nearly all the timber is in that body. Let a man have what portion of the priesthood He may He wants to keep it in lively exercise in order to save himself & family *)

A. P. Rockwood spoke followed by B L Clapp& Levi Hancock then Lorenzo Snow spoke at length & I followed Him& had a good meeting 
 February 17, 1857 ~ Tuesday17th [FIGURE] In company with F. ^D.^ Richards I called upon President Youngand asked him what I should do whare council was asked of me either by the 70s or Bishops. Joseph Young said to the Quorumof seventies that when they were called to be Bishops or councillorsthat they might still retain their place as Presidents of the seventies & not be ordained High Priests. Bishop Hunter thinks that they should Be ordainedBishops & High Priest. what shall I do about it. President Young said if they would go their ^way^ & hold there tongue about it they might stand as they are & act as Councellors to a Bishop, but if they will not, ordain themI said I thought that men ought to walk in the channel pointed outfor them & not complain about it President Young said yes let themdo as they are told. I spent the day in the office reading History & councellingElder L Snow & F. D. Richards was with me a part of the day. I attended the Bishops meetings in the eveing. Bishop Hunter spoke & I followed himI told the Bishops to impress upon the minds of the people the necessityof living their Religion after this date for if the people again commit sin after being forgiven as they now were they would notagain be forgiven but the Justice of the Law would be brought against them & they would have to pay the penalty or be cut off from the Church again I told them they should not boast of their authority & power or that a seventy was greater than a High Priest or that a High Priest was greater than a seventy no man should boast of thepower of the priesthood untill he obtained some of that power &it was manifested upon him & when that was upon him he certainly would not boast of it for the Holy spirit would teach him sens enough to know better. It is vary seldom that I have known the power of the presiesthood made manifest upon the Children of men in our [day] to avary great Degree but in some instances it was manifest as inthe case of the prophet Joseph at the time his [house] was full of the sick &dying & his door Yard & they were strewed along the bank of the River for 2 miles & Joseph Rose up & shook himself like an old Lyion& commenced at his own tent door & healed all the people who wasnot dead on both sides of the river by the power of God his voice was as the voice of God & the earth almost trembled under his feet as he com-manded the sick to arise & be made whole. It was also manifest with Joseph while made fast in chains & in prision in Missouri & his wickedungodly persecuters gathered around him & while he was made fast inchains with his chains Brethren yet they goaded his feelings by boasting of how many murders they had commited & rapes upon mormon women & how they had cut the mormons to peices then they would blaspheme thename of God untill his spirit was reigned up & he rose up in the power ofGod in the midst of his chains & spoke as in the voice of thunder "Silence ye fiends of the pit. I will not live another momen[t] & hear such vile language from mortals, either you or I shall die right here or els youshall scease from boasting of shall such damnable deeds as you are guiltyof."  They quailed before his words like leather wilting in the flames& they bowed before him & made acknowledgements to him this was doneby the power of God. "Again David Patten was taken by an armed mobunder a United States warrant & when he was surrounded with an armedmob of about 40 men under the garb of Law & would not let him say one word inhis own defence but he arose in the power of God & held them fast to their seats untill he addressed them about 1/2 an hour he told them they were cowards rascals & villans & he proved it to them, & they had not power to harm a hair of His head & they let him & Warren Parrish go, away. Again this powerwas manifest with President Brigham Young on the bank of the Missouri Riverat Winter Quarters when the merchants brought up goods to sell to the brethren 
 who were going to the mountains. Old Major Miller the Indian Agent was surrounded by officers & Miller in order to show his great power He told themerchants that owned some Alcohol not to roll a Barrel of [liquor] off from theboat that He would knock the head in & spill it upon the ground president Young steped up & told the men to roll it out & if miller spilled it thatmoment I will spill his clarret He & all the office[r]s turned pale the liquor was rolled out & nobody hurt. And other instances might be named when the power of the priesthood has been manifest but these men have never boasted of it nor never will I made many other remarks. I was followed by Lorenzo Snow who spoke well.February 18, 1857 ~ Wednesday18th I spent the day in the office reading history. Elders L Snow F. D. Richards& E. Hunter was in the office & conversed upon many things. I copy the followingreport from the presidency a month since. He said that is (President Young) that Hewished the Brethren at Carson valley would come home. President Kimball said that I dont want to see the Presidents of the seventies in the stand untill theyget more of the spirit of God for they are dead & the seventies have to receive their food through them.

President Young had O Prattspamphlet read called the Holy Spirit & he made the following remarksafter hearing it read He said that Brother Pratt had got beyong [beyond] the stars He had Carrelled them & got beyond them[FIGURE] President Young asked Wm W Phelps by what authority he hadproclaimed in Public that He (Brigham Young) was the man that the Lord said he would raise up like unto Moses "Phelps said Josephwas gone & you are left to lead the People. B.Y. that is no Argument at all I may die & others be left that does not prove that I or theywould be the one refered to. If I thought I was the man I would not tel of it. But I think I am the great man that none of the prophets ever thought of or spoke of.Orson Hyde said there was a man in Provo professed to have a visitfrom a Departed spirit he comes to him dressed in his templeRob[e]s & the man he comes to has not had his endowments andI want to know what you think of it I thought the whole of itsmelt strongly of BrimstonePresident Young said now if the people in Provo can be made tobelieve that that is a true visit about the third time he comes Hewill say that this Church is not led by the man that ought to lead it but the man that has thos visits will tell you that he is to lead theChurch. Now I will tell you how you may know it is fals a spirit will not come to a man in the flesh without he appears in his glory& men cannot endure his glory a resurrected body may come & hide his glory. but that visitation is false it is not trueI went to the 14th ward school House to meeting O Hyde & many others were there as missionaries several spoke I followed withfew remarks & was followed by O HydeMarch 9, 1857 ~ Monday9th I spent the day in the office mostly I set out some trees & grape vinesMarch 10, 1857 ~ Tuesday10th I set out currant Bushes & grape vines I spent a part of the day in the office I attended the missionary meeting in the evening & had a good time I spoke a short time at the close of the meeting 
 March 11, 1857 ~ Wednesday11th I spent the fore part of the day setting out vines & currantsthe after noon in the officeMarch 12, 1857 ~ Thursday12th I set out 5 Almonds & 25 peach trees one Apricott & one plum in my Garden this fore noon I spent the afternoon in the officeMarch 13, 1857 ~ Friday13 I spent the day in the officeMarch 14, 1857 ~ Saturday134th I spent the fore part of the day Grafting Apples & pears the afternoon I spent in the office. President Young called in & Herd History read nearly all the afternoon He heard a part of his own history read, & a part of the continuation of the History of the the Death of Joseph. I attended a feast at A. O. Smoots Bishop Hunter J. C. Little & J Horn was present with their wivesMarch 15, 1857 ~ Sunday15 Sunday I spent the day at the Tabernacle. G. D. Grant Preached followed by J. D. T. MCallister then by Brother Kimball who spoke at length. In the afternoon President Young spoke a vary interesting sermon from the following text "who is my Father Mother Brothers & sisters they are those who do the will of my father which is in heaven." [##Matthew 12:50##] I attended the prayer Circle. President Young said he had the following dream. I thought we had a great crop of wheat the whole Earth was filled with it all around the Heads were very long & there was so much of it the people did not seem to care any thing about it, did not try to save it I had to continually urge the people to save the wheat they said they had more than they wanted for this year I told them to go to & save all the wheat they had then next year they could work on the Temple."President said that the King Philip corn was nothing more than the Jumbo Corn some man plants an acre & takes great care of it & he gets a great crop of it, the way they got corn so early they will take the ear that sets first & pull the silk out of all the rest then plant the but part of that Ear & that will make early corn now that is the way with the best breed of cattle, they keep picking out the best for stock, & that increases the goodness of them. Owen wanted his society to adopt this plan to take all the noble men & women & raise up a society when they had a dwarf send him awayPresident Young said to Elder O Hyde you have been to both Jerrusalem & Zion & seen both I have not seen either for I never have been in Jackson county now it is a plesant thing to think of to know whare the old garden of Eden is did you ever think of it, or sens it, I do not think many do, now Jackson County is the Garden of Eden, Joseph has declaired this & I am as much bound to believe it as much as I am to believeJoseph is a prophet of God, many in Jackson county have found out that they cannot cultivate the Temple Block & other places in that county we must let the Lord take his own time to prepare the way for our return to that county & to build up that Temple16 I spentI went to the 15 ward & preached during the evening to the peopleMarch 16, 1857 ~ Monday16th I spent the day in the office writing I attended the meeting of the seventies in the evening. Brother Joseph Young spoke to the peoplein a vary edefying manner exhorted them to get the spirit of God 
 & Edify the people He was followed by W. Woodruff I told them that I felt like bearing testimony to what brother Joseph had said his teachings were Just & true. You cannot edify this people without you speak by the Holy Ghost a man may have all the Eloquence of a Cicero or the knowledge of the world combined & he cannot feed the immortal mind of a Latter Day saint unless he speaks by the spirit of God. He maytalk of visions & revelations or any thing Els unless he has the spirit of God He will not edefy this people look at the teaching of the prophet Joseph all other men might preach though many might preach by the spirit of the Lord & Edify the people yet if the people knew that Joseph was going to preach the people would poor out of their houses like beesout of a Hive. So with President Young at this day if the people knew that He was going to preach they would fill the Tabernacle an hour before the time of meeting. his words are plain & easy but they are filled with the spirit & power of God unto EdificationI was followed by F. D. Richards who spoke well unto EdifycationMarch 17, 1857 ~ Tuesday17th I spent the day in the office on the History of the Twelve & found great difficulty in obtaining any thing for the History of those who had apostitized. I attended the meeting of the Bishops Bishop Hunter spoke & said he wished the clerk to keep a strict Account of their meetings as it would make a good History He councilled the Bishops to finish the canal & do all that is required of them. Joseph Young spoke said that was the first time that He ever attended a Bishops meeting in his life He spoke vary well I followed him [FIGURE] The following is a Brief synopsis of my remarks I said I felt to say a few words we have had a good exertation from Brother Joseph Young He said some had thought that we should have the privilege of coming to thes vallies & setting down & resting but he thought that we had as much to do as ever I think so to I am thoroughly converted to the faith that we shall never arive at that period of existance when we shall not have sumthing to do I believe our work will increase throughout all Eternity though we may not have to gain our bread by the sweat of our brow neither shall we always have to cultivate the soil in the midst of thornes & briers. Our Father in Heaven is always busy his kingdom & works are increaseing & I believe it will be the same with us throughout all Eternity if we are saved. There is another subject which I wish to speak of. Brother Hunter said that He wanted the clerk to keep a record of their meetings as it would make a good History this is a subject I have always felt interestedin & as there are many branches in the kingdom of God so their should be some persons engaged in each branch I have often spoken upon this subject & I have often thought that to many it was dry and uninteresting to many I mean the subject of Journal writing & keeping a history of what transpires with us from day to day. I was deeply impressed with the importance of this subject to day while reading the History of the organization of the quorum of the Twelve and the remarks of the Prophet Joseph upon the subject. He said -["I have for myself learned a fact by experience which on reflection gives me much sorrow. It is a truth that if I now had in my possession evry decission which has been given upon important items of Doctrin & duties since the rise of this church they would be of incalculable worth to the saints but we have neglected to keep a record of such things thinking perhaps that they never benefit us afterwords which had we now would decide almost 
 any point that might be agitated and now we cannot bear record to the Church nor unto the world of the great & glorious manifestation that have been made to us with that degree of power and authority which we otherwise could if we had those decissions to publish abroad [FIGURE] Since the Twelve are now chosen I wish to tell them a coursewhich they may persue & be benefited here after in a point of light of which they perhaps are not now aware. At all times when you assemble in the capacity of a council to transact business let the oldest of your Number preside & let one or more be appointed to keep a record of your procedings & on the decission of evry important item let it be what it may let such decission be noted down and they will ever after words remain upon record as LAW covenants & doctrin. Questions thus deci[d]ed might at the time appear unimportant but should they be recorded & one of you lay hands upon them after words you might find them of infinate worth not ownly to your brethren but a feast also to your own souls" "Should you assemble from time to time & procede to discuss import-ant (subjects) or questions & pass decissions by & by upon them & omit to record such decisions by & by you will be driven to straits from which you will not be able to extricate yourselves & not being in a situation to bring your faith to bear with sufficient perfection or power to obtain the desired information. Now in consequence of a neglect to write these things when God revealed them not essteeming them of sufficient worth the spirit may withdraw & God may be angry and here is a fountain of intelligence or knowledge of infinate importance which is lost. what was the cause of this the answer is slothfulness or Neglect to appoint a man to occupy a few moments in writing" "[FIGURE] Here Let me prophesy the time will come when if you neglect to do this you will fall by the Hands of unrighteous men were you to be brought before the authorities and accused of any crime or misdemienor and be as innocent as the angels of God unless you can prove that you were some whare els your Enemies will prevail against you but if you can bring Twelve men to testify that you were in some other place at that time you will escape there hands now if you will be careful to keep minutes of these things as I have said it will be one of the most important & interesting records ever seenI have now laid these things before you [for] your consideration and you are left to act according to your own Judgment"]- (See record of the Twelve Historians office) ^and History of the Church February 1835^ I have thus refered to sume of the words of Joseph to the Twelve Apostles at their organization. This shows the feelings of the Prophet Joseph upon this subject I have had this same subject upon my mind ever since I have been a member of the church I have been inspired & moved upon to keep a Journal & write the affairs of this church as far as I can I did not understand why my feelings was exercised so much in the early age of this church but I understand it now I seldom ever heard Brother Joseph or the Twelve preach or teach any principle but what I felt as uneasy as a fish out of water untill I had written it then I felt right I could write a sermon of Josephs a week after it was delivered almost word for word & after it was written it was taken from me or from my mind this was a gift from God unto me and I have kept a Journal of almost evry day of my life for the last 24 years I could tell each day what I had done, what company I was in & what was transpiring around me and any teachings or councils from the presidency of the Church except whare I knew that reporters had 
 written there discourses & I have urged this same course upon the Twelve & all the corums of the Church to keep a record of there meetings & the dealings of God with them & for all men who bear the Priesthood to keep a record of their lives esspecially of all their official acts in the church & kingdom of God. You may say that this is a great deal of trouble vary well it has been to me in one sens it has occupied nearly evry leasure moment of my time for 24 years but what of it I have never spent any of my time more profitably for the benefit of manking [mankind] than in my Journal writing for a great portion of the Church History has been compiled from my Journals & some of the most gloriousGospel sermons truths & revelations that were given from God to this people through the mouth of the Prophets Joseph, Brigham, Heber & the Twelve could not be found upon the Earth on record ownly in my Journals & they are compiled in the Church History & transmitted to the saints of God in all future Generations does not this pay me for my trouble it does in many instances in this Church men have been appointed clerks to write for the church they have kept the records instead of delivering them to the President of the Church whare they belonged & some they would appostitize then they would insult the Church by offer-ing to sell them their own records at an enormous price. I have deposited my records & Journals in the Historians office whare I hope they may do some good. we have had a vary interestingtime this winter during the referamation among the Latter day saints the spirit & power of God has been poured out in a wonderful manner & many glorious truths have been revealed through the presidency Twelve & others & in the various quorums meeting now should not their be a record kept of these things in the comm-encement of these meeting the clerks took quite full reports but thinking it to much trouble they now take them vary short & we can hardly get an outline of the real facts of our meetings & the power of God & the dealings of God with us evry man should write a brief history of his life his parentage, His birth his religion when he was baptized & by whom when ordained what to & by [w]home give a brief sketch of all his missions & of all his offical acts & the dealings of God with him then if He was to die & the Historians wished to publish his history they would have sumthing to go by. Many may think this a dry subjet & unimportant but it is not so to me I am now trying to get up a history of the Twelve Apostles as first organized half of them are now out of the Church & scarsly any record left whareby I can get a correct knowledge of their ministry or work & some of those who remain & are labouring to build up the kingdom of God have not kept a record of their missions ministry offical acts & decission upon important subjects & the gifts graces & dealings of God with them sufficient to give a true & corret History of their lives their are but few aside from the presidency of this church who feel the import-ance of this subjet sufficent to put it in practice. It may be considered by some not important to write or keep a record of our work or the work of God but I believe it is otherwise the Prophets would not have been moved upon to exhort us to faithfulness upon this subject the Lord has told us that what we seal on Earth shall be sealed in heaven & what we record on Earth shall be recorded in heaven & what is not sealed or recorded on Earth is not sealed 
 or recorded in heaven therefore it appears to be vary important that we do keep a true & faithful record in all things. while walking in a rapid stream we cannot tread twice in the same water neither can we spend twice the same time when we pass out of that door the work of this meeting will be closed to us forever we shall never spend the time of this evening again then should we not keep a record of our work teachings & council which we give in this meeting we should. again Elders go forth upon missions to the Nations of the Earth the[y] have to Enter into a regular warfare the Lord pours out his Holy Spirit upon them & they war with the world the flesh, & the Devil, with kings, princes, Lords, Presidents & rulers He is cast into prision the Lord delivers him. The Devil enters into some of his converts & He lays hands upon them & he cast them out, the saints are sick & he heals them, He prophesies in the name of the Lord & his words come to pass. Rulers declair that He shall not preach to the people on pain of death. He preaches the word of God & many believe obey & rejoice in the Lord & he is protected by the power of God. He goes upon the Sea the storms rage & he calmsthe water & wind in the name of the Lord. He is shielded & guarded by angels of God all the day long & he knows the power of Godis with him & reveals unto him all the evils that lie in his path And yet he does not view thise great & important things of value enough to make a record of them to spend a short time inwriting them & the circumstances & history of those blessings unto him are lost both to the present & all future generation. are these things wright I do not believe they are. I do not believe a man is Justified in neglecting to record these things. Now as an example should the Ten lost tribes of Israel suddenly come pouring down upon us in the Land of Zion Led by the Holy prophets of God what would be one of the first inquiries we should make of them it would be whare are your records & history & the revelations & dealings of God with you since you were lead away under Shalmanezar king of Asyria? O do let me see them & read them & do let me [read] the Journal of your travels from the North country to Our land of Zion & what would be our disappo-intment should the prophets & Elders say O we have not got any history of the dealings of God with us nor any Journal of our travels we used to hear our Fathers say that there hath been great & mighty things done in the Land whare we lived the savior come & taught great & marvellous things & we had a glorious time in coming here we smote the rocks & the mighty mountains of Ice fell down with a great noise & great miriacles were wrought butour Fathers had so much to do & we have had so much to do that we never had any time to write any thing about it & we did not think that any body would have any interest in it but ourselves & so we did not write. would we not be awfully disappointed we should & so with them should they ask for our records & say that Jesus & the Angels had told th us that you was building up Zion & doing a great work in the Earth & that great & glorious things were revealed unto you & we now wish to read these things & should we tell them that we had done as they had that we had not kept a record of any of these things they would be like ourselves much disappointed, but if they & ourselves should both keep a strict record of all that is useful then it would add great Joy to both them & us. Then let us lay these things to heart & keep a true & faithful record that we may be Justified befor God 
 March 18, 1857 ~ Wednesday18th I spent the day in the office on History I spent the evening at homeMarch 19, 1857 ~ Thursday19th I spent this day in the office on History I commenced the History of the Twelve Apostles I find it difficult to get much history of some of the first Twelve who have apostitize & left the ChurchMarch 20, 1857 ~ Friday20th I spent most of the day in the Office Journal writing & on History of the Twelve Luke Johnson was with me in the eveningMarch 21, 1857 ~ Saturday21st [FIGURE] I bought an Indian boy of Brother Willis this morning abot 6 years old. His Indian name was Saroquetes we call him Nephi He appears like a smart active good boy I paid $40 for him I am in hopes to Educate him & prepare his mind that He may some day be use-ful in preaching to his tribe of the Piedes. I sowed some Australia wheat & french Oats & peas to dayMarch 22, 1857 ~ Sunday22nd Sunday I attended meeting in the Tabernacle F. D. Richards spoke in the morning followed by W. Woodruff & H. C. Kimball in the afternoon. Elder Wheelock Wm Kimball & D. H. Wells in the afternoon. we had a good meeting. I attended the prayer meeting in the evening President Young said we have got to send men to the Islands to liberate those who are there we would gather the saints from there but the laws are against it. F. D. Richards said their was abot 60 saints in Dresden President Young said the Lord would soon open the way for the gospel inthose Governments I would like to send some Elders to Siberia and also to the Japanees Islands with Proper papers the Lord will soon open the way in the world I attended the 16th ward meeting this evening & Preached to the people the spirit of the Lord was with me & we had a good meeting & some to theMarch 23, 1857 ~ Monday23rd Monday I met at the 14th ward school House with the Bishop & members of the ward & I dedicated the new Font for Baptizing the a Hymn was was sung & I offered up the dedication Prayer & said, O God the Eternal Father we bow before thee in the Name of Jesus Christ & by virtue of the Holy Priesthood to dedicate & consecrate this ground &Baptismal Font unto the Lord our God. we Pray for thy blessing O Lord to rest upon us in this Holy Ordinance we dedicate this ground & thisFont & the water which it contains unto the name of the Lord and wepray thee to Bless & sanctify this Ground & Font & may iet be Holy before thee & the water which is in the Font & m[a]y thy power & Holy spirit rest upon the Bishop of this ward & his councellors and uponevry man who goeth down into this Faunt Font to baptize the children of men may no unclean thing enter into this Font or any one come into it to be baptized unworthyly & may they blessings rest upon all men who shall administer in thy name in this Font & upon all who shall be administerd unto by thy servants & we pray that the inhabit-ants of this word shall lay aside all their sins & evils & may thy blessings rest upon them we ask the[e] Holy Father to except of this dedication & consecration at our hands which we offered unto thee in the Name of thy Son Jesus Christ Amenat the close of the prayer Elder Franklin D Richards went into the Font & Baptized his Father Phineas Richards & abut 40 others I went into the school House & assisted in confirming 14 Samuel W Richards was mouth in the confermation of his Father the Elders continued to Baptize & confirmed members of the 14th ward through the day. I met in council with the Rush valley Herd company 
 and we decided to bring over all the Heard & deliver them to the owners. I attended A councel with the Presidency & Twelve & others on the case of Bishop Hoagland & his wife Agnes she brought a complaint against him that He did not pay attention enough to her & provide well enough for her after hearing the matter on both sides President Young said now go & do right & let Bishop Hoagland Baptise you the same as the rest of the ward. I do not wishto say much about this case but I think many things that I do not want to say their is many women that care more about their wives Husband sleeping with them than they do about God or his kingdom & if a man was to submit to such women he would not be worth shucks in building up the kingdom of God I have got some such woman & I visit them one a year or once in 3 years as I please & they may go to heaven or Hell just as they please I shall not turn away from the work of God for any woman if the people will follow the council of the 14th ward Bishop they will be led into the kingdom of God & so will Agness but she wants pillow council instead of ward council well now if Agnes never hears any more pillow council or private council take the council which he gives to the whole ward & you will be saved men must attend to the duties of the kingdom of God first before any other object and Now Agnes go home & do right & Brother Hoagland go & Baptize her if she wishes to be & so here the matter dropedI attended the council of Seventies at the 70s Hall Hosea Stout D Candlin & D Willkie addressed the meeting was followed by W Woodruff & F.

But when the circumstanceswere told President Brigham Young sustained the Brethren who pres-ided at Provo He said they had done [blank] The subjects of Eunuchscame up & Joseph said that He would rath er die than to bemade a Eunuch Brigham said the day would come whenthousands would be made Eunuchs in order for them to be saved in the kingdom of God. The subject of women & Adulterry came up Joseph Asked if a woman & man who were married could commit Adultery Brigham said that Josephsaid they could not yet He was satisfied they could do wrong Presi-dent Young said we cannot KClens the Platter because the peoplewill not bear it. Joseph I am willing to have the people Clens the platter if they can do it in righteousness & Judge righteous Judg-ment. Brigham. This people never was half as well prepared to execute righteousness as Now. I will tell you that when a manis trying to do right & do some thing that is not exactly in order I feel to sustain him & we all should. I wish there was some propheton Earth who could tell us just how much sin we must sustain beforewe can chastize the people & correct their errors. The wicked may go to the states & call for troops I dont think the people will get rich 
 to come after us they have got a long road to travel we have eithergot to Join hands with sin & sinners or we have got to fight themThe subject of Adultery again came up Joseph said a man cannotcommit Adultery with his wife so says the revelation on the Patriarchsmarriage yet a man can do rong in having connexion with hishis wife at times Joseph Young aske said the Ancient Apostle said thisa man should not put away his wife fsave for the cause of fornicationif He did they would both commit Adultery. Brigham Youngsaid Joseph taught that when a womans affections was entirlyweaned from her husband that was Adultery in spiri her Affections were Adulterated from his He also said that therewas No law in Heaven or on Earth that would compel a woman to stay with a man either in time or Eternity this I think is true (but I do not know) that if a man that is a High priest takes a woman & she leaves him & goes to one of a lesser office say the Lesser priesthood or member I think in the resurrection that that High Priest can claim her "Josephwhat if she should not want to go with him I should notwant a woman under those circumstances. Brigham I will tellyou what you will find that all those evil traditions & affectio[ns]or passions that Haunt the mind in this life will all be done away in the resurrection you will find then that any man whogets a glory & exaltation will be so beautiful that any woman would be willing to have him if it was right & wharever it is rightfor the woman to go there she will be willing to go for all thoseevils will vanish to which we are subject in this life. I havetold the people the truth Just as it is but others will at timesget up & tell the people that they will get no heaven ^[FIGURE]^ ownly whatthey make in this life and that it will be in the next world as it is in this now they do not mean whaat they say they do notexplain themselves Hence the people will not understand what issaid to them. Joseph said I wish I knew what my limits were. Brigham Your limits are endless & you have not got halfway to the end of it yet. Now hwhen I was an Elder I was aswilling to correct an Error in the Brethren as I am now. But the people do not see it so. Now if you should be with the 12 or any body you would have a right to correct an Error as well as with a member but you could not correct themby cutting them off from the Church because they are overyou in the priesthood. many other remarks were made at the timeJune 3, 1857 ~ Wednesday3rd Brother Oliphant grafted some of my trees to day I spentmost of the day with him I bought a yoke of 4 year old yokedof Durham Oxen deep red paid $125 for them of Hooper A Lyman arived home this evening with the Calafornia mailJune 4, 1857 ~ Thursday4th I looked over Accounts to day with J.

(Brother Woodruff said it was written) Now the USare trying to force a Govornor upon us we will not Receive him the Lord has said our govornor will procede out of the midst of us this is in the Bible Brother Woodruff turn to it. (Brother Woodruff opened the Bible promiscously & opened diretly to the passage in the 30 chapter of Jeremiah 21st verse) & read it to the congregation. mMany remarks were made by the speaker all of which are reported. In the After noon John Taylor spoke lengthy had much of the spirit of the Lord & the people were Edifyed He was followed By President Daniel H Wells who also spoke in the spirit & Power of God concerning Zion the armies of Israel, & the armies of the wicked He was ready to fight & defend Zion, all was reported We went to the prayer Circle President Young was sick but he was in the Circle said he could not feel that the Enemy would come this seasonAugust 24, 1857 ~ Monday24th I spent the day in the office on Brother Kimballs HistoryAugust 25, 1857 ~ Tuesday25 I spent this day in the office on HistoryAugust 26, 1857 ~ Wednesday26th [FIGURE]  I budded a few peach trees early in the morning I called in Presidents Young Office An express had come in from deer Creek Brought the report that our Emigration was getting along 
 Aug 26 1857vary well the Chianes [Cheyennes] had stolen 480 Head of General Harne'sBeef Cattle. Col Sumner had been out with his command 10 day longer than He was rationed for & fears of his friends was that He was cut off General Harney was intending to removeall mormon stations on the road & go by forced marches so that no word would reach the mormons in Utah before him President Young said I have sent General Harney word that I wish for peace & do not wish to fight any body but He mustnot come Here with his armey if he undertakes it I shall stop him. He said to Brother Mathews when you get in Calafornia the people will try to stop you & hedge you up so that you cannot strengthen us you must be upon the watch tower. The Nation is determined to make us free they are determined to drive us to defend our selves & become independant. The Nation is breaking to peases in spirit their is no Union among them & before the United States get through trying to destroy us they will want to let out the Job I told the people years ago that if they would let us alone we would Convert & revolutionize the world if they did not let us alone but undertake take to break us up we should spread abroad the faster & do the work so much the sooner & we will do it if this nation now makes war upon us we will be free & build up the kingdom of God the sooner. The people have tried all the time to destroy us but they have failed all the time when the government called for 500 of our men they had no idea that we would comply with their request this plan was laid to destroy the saints & tomas Benton then had orders in his pocket to destroy the Mormons if they refused Jesus said the time would come when we should sell our coat & buy a sword, that time has come and we have got to go & deliver ourselves from our enemies & the Lord will help us He will fight our battles & we will become an independant kingdom. I feel well & I will tell you why if I am right and I know I am and that is this people are now much nearer their Fathers face than they ever were before they are united and willing to do the will of God and this causes me to rejoice. The people now fell to say it is the kingdom of God or nothing it is not my farm or my house but the kingdom of God this is the case with this people. Brother Kimball said Old Buck was now free the yoke was off his neck & it would not be upon his neck again. Many other remarks were made but not written. There were present B. Young H C. Kimball D H. Wells O Hyde W Woodruff J Taylor Capt Hooper Joseph Young Ferrymore Little President Young said that I am satisfied that the Post Master in Calafornia was authorized to open our Mail & read our Letters & retain what He pleased & send on what He pleased I will insure that our Letters to the Elders on the Isles of the Sea will be opened & read I pray the Lord to reveal to those Brethren what our desire is that they may come home.President Young came into the Histor-ians office at 15 minuts to 2 oclok He sent for me I was at home I immediately went to the office. Presidents Young Wells & F D Richards was in the office. President Young said 
 to me as I came in have you a team I told him I had a pair of small Ponies. He asked If I could spare themI Hesitated a moment & said IYes sir, I can do any thing that is wanted. He then said I have a good pair of Horses that I want to let you have, as you are labouring here I was taken quite surprised it camevary unexpeted to me. I excepted the Horses & was thankful though perhaps I did not say it at the time Brother Wells went & showed them to me I tok themhome they were a fine large pair of sorrell Horses they were offered 200 bushels of wheat for them to day. President Young stayid 3 1/2 hours incompiling his History. He remarked that the revelation upon a plurality of wives was given to Joseph Smith in 1831 He revealed it to Oliver Cowdery alone upon the solem pledge that He would not reveal it or act upon it it but He did act upon it in a secret manner & that was the cause of his overthrow. President Young also said that the United States are driving this people to war sooner thanis for their good for we are civilizing the Indians & if they would give us time we would give them a knowledge so that when they do fight the Gentiles that they would have some Judgment & not kill women & Children & those who ought tonot to be killed. There is now many of the emigration on the way to Carson valley the Gentile emigrants shoot the indians wharever they meet with them & the Indians now retaliate & will kill innocent People. One woman who had fitted out to kome here to investigate Mormonism she was killed & all her teamsters & all these through the folly of EmigrantsAugust 27, 1857 ~ Thursday27th I spent the fore noon in the office the afternoon I watered my garden & budded my peach orchard with Carringtons 2nd Early& his large yellow Peach & ApricottAugust 28, 1857 ~ Friday28th I spent the forepart of the day in the House of the Lord giving Endowments the evening I spent in the office[FIGURE] The present signs of the times show that we as a people as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints & the Kingdom of God are approaching the most important period & Craices [crisis] that we have ever seen since the organization of the Church, their is a solemnity & anxiety resting upon all Israel. The Government of the United States have now entered the field as our persecuters & are determined in their harts to destr-oy us from off the Earth as far as it is in their power The President James Buch^a^nnan & the Congress of the Nation containing 35000000 people have sent an Armey of men of numbering some 3000 armed with all instruments of death to destroy us as a people they are now marching towards us upon the plains & one or two month from this date must decide the case with us whether we have to go out to war and meet in deadly combat this winter or not. The Gentiles are vary wicked & the cup of the United States as a Nation is full & they are enemies to God & his kingdom & people they are determined in their hearts that God & his Christ shall have no kingdom on the Earth & they are now about to make war upon his saints the time is at the door that will try mens souls the Lord has 
 Aug. 28th 1857promised to fight the battles of his saints nevertheless the saints will be tried whether they will abide in his covenant even unto death whether we are willing to lay down our lives for Christ sake, word has been sent out to call in the Elders from abroad from among the Gentiles, & the gospel has begun to go to the Lamanites & the Lord is about to remember his covenant with that people, the Judgments of our God must now soon be poured out upon the Gentile world & the children of Jacob & the House of Israel must go forth & fulfill their destiny & help build up Zion all nations are becomeing vary wicked may the Lord give us grace according to our day & help us to stand the test & prove in the hour of trial & temptation torue to our God, our Brethren, & our covenants. And I ask the Lord in the Name of Jesus Christ to Preserve the Presidency of this Church with the cities people & Records of the Saints from the hands of wicked and ungodly men. I pray that the Lord will preserve me for a season that I may labour to assist in preserving & keeping a record of this Church & kingdom & the dealings of God with us & preserve me O Lord from dishonouring my calling or priesthood but give me faith power & grace to pass through what ever I may be called to meet. It appears as though the whole world was about to make war upon the kingdom of God. In years that are past & gone we have had towns cities, counties & states with the Govornor & people against us. Now the whole Nation has risen up against us, vary well, let lightnings flash & thunders roll & Earth quake bellow and let all hells dark Hosts gather in battle array against God and his Christ against the Church & kingdom of our God against Brigham Heber & Daniel & the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb of God & all ther followers Let the Heathen rage & the people imagin vain things let them take council to destroy the Lords Anointed. Yet God will laugh at their calamity & mock when their fear comes for their destructionshall come like a whirlwind even in an instant suddenly it shall over take them like a woman in treval & their shall be no power to deliver, & all the Judgments which God the Lord, or Prophets Apostles or Holy men have said shall come upon them shall be fulfilled upon their heads & not one Jot or tittle shall fail. Rejoice O ye Heavens & be Glad O Earth & all the righteous who dwell therein for the Lord God Omnipitent reigneth & his will will be done in all things for he holds the destiny of all men in his hands the wicked as well as the righteous. Let the prayers of thy people O God come up into thine Eares & let them be answered upon the Head of the wicked & Let the blood of all thy Prophets O God be avenged upon the Earth untill the wicked shall scease to reign & untill the Earth shall be cleansed from all the abominationwhich now dwell upon it fulfill thy covenants O God which thou hast made with Israel in the Last days & let the Gentiles who dwell upon this land be spedily cut off inasmuch as they will not repent. Send they Judgments O God into the Armies of the United States who are coming against us to battle & let them be destroyed that they shall have no power over thy saints any more at all

Woodruff spoke to the people & bore testimony to what had been said by thepresidency, was followed by President WellsI attended the prayer Meeting in Presidents upper roomwe herd letters read from Samuel Richards & Snider H. S. Eldridge& Goosebeck. President Young said Brother Bernhisel I presume we shall not have any one in Congress next winter to presentour memorials & interest (J.M.B. No I think not) I think itwill make some of the People squirm when they hear that I am taking the property which the Government has sent into this Territory some of our Brethren going down to the states metabout 60 of the Chians they were vary Friendly to them the Indians stole 800 fat cattle & the rest was driven back to the states so the Army has no cattle with them ownly fortheir present use some said that they believed that those Indians who stole the cattle were half mormon & began todam them Brother Murdock remarked we are all mormons here in this company & I dont wish to hear my friends abusedPresident Young said what will the people think in Europe whenthey come to hear that Brigham Young is at the Head of the vigilance committies in Calafornia & the Cansas Troubles & that the Government of the United States could not remove him untill the Lord see fit to let them. The world accuse meof controlling the affiairs of Calafornia & Kansas &c the peopledo believe that we have a Band called the Danites but how could they exist so long without sheding Blood for we cannot find that they have killed any body But I do not know of any such men. I think that James Buchanan has got in a Badfix he has got the yoke on his neck & has to carry it alone 
 with no ox to carry the other End but He is pounding his own shins& will soon pound the shins of others for the moment He gave consent to send an armey to destroy this people he placed himself as the shedder of innocent Blood & the Judgments of God will follow him. when war does break out between the north & south it will be the most bloody. G A. Smith said that the ownly thing forthe President of the United States to get out of his trouble ownly to get a Bill through Congress to admit any territory as soon as they had population Enough to organize a State Government & to be received at once into the Government or Union with equal privileges with the other States. President Young then said letme suggest a matter Brother Smith is presiding at Limhi salmonRiver now do we not want a station about half way fromhere say near fort Hall should we not send men say 20 to make a station there it was thought best to do so. He said thatthe north is the place for us & not the south no one but the saints would want the cold North country. This is the [FIGURE] ofthis Continent & I think we had better keep near the lock & kepp the [FIGURE] in our own hand. If we send a company we want to send them this fall so that we can put in grain there this season6th President Young came into the office a short time Thomas B Marsh spent the fore noon with us helping about his historyI spent most of the day oin the officeSeptember 7, 1857 ~ Monday7th I budded some peach trees this morning I went to the office at 11 oclok& spent the remainder of the day in the officeSeptember 8, 1857 ~ Tuesday8th I budded peach trees in the morning & spent most of the day in the office. Capt Van Vlvleeit arived this evening in this City he had an Interview with Gov Youngin the eveningSeptember 9, 1857 ~ Wednesday9th Capt Van vleeit met with the Govornor in the social Hall at 9 oclok with the presidency & Twelve& some 100 citizens He presented Gov Young witha letter of Instructions or request which was read before the assembly & but little said & a great dealthought. Capt van vleeit asked if there was lumberto be bought & grain & Hay &c president said thatthere was a plenty in the country. President Young asked if there was any one present who could supply captVan vleeit any lumber that He wanted Brother SamuelSnider arose & said that that He could supply 40000 feet of Lumber. No other one said any thing President Youngtook had private conversation with the Captain in theafternoon President Young walked with Captain Van Vlietthrough his Garden & orchard & through Professor Carringt-ons the Capt Asked Mrs Carrington if she was willing to cut down her fine peach orchard for her faith &Religin she said "yes and would set up nights to doit if it became necessary 
 September 10, 1857 ~ Thursday10th I went into the Big field with a Brother Thomas to sethim to work ploughing my field for wheat. I spent the afternoon in the office I heard G A Smith's History read. President Young took Capt Stewart Van Vliet through his house introduced him to his family &cSeptember 11, 1857 ~ Friday11th I spent this day in the Endowment House we gave83 their endowment.September 12, 1857 ~ Saturday12th We got in an express this morning saying that ther was some 900 troops on the way this side of Laramie& some 12 government Baggage trains. Capt Van Vlieeitcame into the office & President Young had a good deal of conversation with him. He said to him I do not want to fight the United States but if they driveus to it we shall do the best we can & I will tell youas God lives that we shall come off conquerer for we trust in God. For God has set up his kingdomon the Earth & it will never fall but it will standwe shall do all we can not to fight but if they drive us to it God will overthrow them. if they would let us alone & say to the mobs now you may go & kill the Mormons if you can but we will have nothing to do with it this is all we would ask of them But for the Government of the United States to array their armies against us it is to despicable & damnable for any honorable Nation& God will have them in derission for doing it. The Govern-ment has all the time endeavoured to destroy us in an under-handed manner. But Now if they come against us we will whip them all the time and you will see that we will do it. The United States are sending theirarmies to hold us still untill a Mob can come and kill us and they have done this all time. we are thesupporters of the United States Constitution, & we love the Constitution & Laws of the United States. But it isthe corrupt Administration of those Laws which weare suffering under & not the Laws. if the Laws had been carried out in Missouri it would have hung Gov Boggs Between the heavens & the Earth and all his friendswho was in the murdering & expelling the Saints from the states they shot down the mormons whenever they could. They killed Joseph & Hiram. Then when Col Harden came into Nauvoo with his armey He did not inq-uire who killed Joseph Smith or Hiram or any of thesaints who had been killed but enquired for some missing Man that we knew Nothing about & said he should Hold me responsible for the life of that man. This has been the course with the Government all the time. We got up a Memorial or declaration to the Congress of the United States last winter the Declaration was then read to the Capt Van Vleeit after hearing it he said I cannotfind any fault with it ownly it is couched in vary strong language. President Young said that is what I intended. And I will now ask capt Van Vleit if 
 Aug 12, 1857noDrummond was not the maine cause of the United States sending thereir Armies against us "I think it is. There is not anyof the government officers which have been sent here who have any interest with us But they have triedto destroy us. Capt van vleit said this is the casewith most men in the Territories they received theiroffices as a steping stone to the senatorship, but they haveno interest for the people. This people have been lied about theworst of any people I ever saw the greatest hold the world have now upon you is they accuse you of Burning 900 vol of the United States Statutes. Thomas Williams who was one of the owners of the Books which were burned denies their being any Books of the United States being burned. I have told the people all the time all I asked of them was to tell the truth about us to pay their debts & steal Nothing theyare welcome to go their way. No[w] if this governmenthas arived at that state that they will tri to kill the people for their religion No honorable man should be afraid of them. President Young then told the story about the Quaker that a Yankey went to whipthe Quaker said that he was not the man that he wantedHe had not done any thing wrong but the man said He would whip him any how so the Quaker laid down his hat & coat & said lie there religion untill I whip this man & he didwhip him tremendiously. It will be so with the United States if they insist in whiping us they will get awfully whipedCapt Van Vleit we have treated all men as well as we have you who have been sent here as officers of the US government. we wish still to treat them well and we would like to ward off this Blow if we could But the United States are determined to drive us to fightwe cannot do any thing but what the government will take exception to it. They will kill us if they can I have prof of this. They killed Joseph & Hiram in Jail not with stand-ing the faith of the Govornor the Armey & the states was pleged to protect them, & when they had killed themthey then got a writ for me I carried a large Bowie knife with me and I said that any man that laid handsupon my sholder and said Mr Young you are my prisioner I would send that man to hell across lots & I have said that all the time since and I say it now I have broaken now law neither will I be taken by any United Statesofficers to be killed as they have killed Joseph. They did once take a Bogus Brigham which was Brother Miller & took him to Carthage & did not find out his mistake untill they got him there. Capt Van vleit said thatI do not think that it is the intention of the Government totake you but to instill a New Governor in this TerritoryPresident Young said I Believe that you tell the truth that you believe this but you do not know their intentions as wellas I do. when you get away from here you will think of a great many things which you have seen and heardThe people have all the time accused us of Colleagueing with theIndians against the Government & they were much afraid 
 that Joseph Smith would go amoung the Indians & they watched to keep him away from them but now they have driven us into their midst and now I want you to watch the signs of the times & you will see that God will work against that Nations who are trying to destroy both the Indians & Mormons the Government has become corrupt & they are the ones who are breaking the Constitution ofthe United [States] & if it is ever saved it will be saved by the Mormons who are the Elders of IsraelSeptember 13, 1857 ~ Sunday13th Sunday I arose in the morning saddled my horse rode into my field 4 miles & back I then went to the House of Sister Foss & laid hands upon her with Brother Smoot as she was sick we then went to Meeting in the Tabernacle & John Taylor Preached a splendid discourse upon the first Principles of the gospel. He was followed by President Brigham Young who said that he had had the persecu-tions of the Saints before him all the morning that He was righteously angry He was so angry he could not preach. But He did preach in the power of God & told the people his Feelings. Capt Van Vleit set by & when President Young spoke of the wickedness & cor-ruption of the government it made him feel at the close of the meeting we met with the missionaries who were appointed to lecture upon the subject of Home Manufacturing we then went into council with the presidency to select a company of missionaries to go & make a settlement on Black foot fork 63 volunteered & 42 of them were chosen at the close of this council Iwent direct to the Meeting at the Tabernacle Charles R Dainaspoke first He had Just returned from England when he went on his mission the Twelve Blessed him I was mouth He said evry word which I proclaimed upon his head was fulfilled to the vary letter. He was followed by G. A. Smith who spoke of his southern tour, &c He was followed by President Young who gave Uncle Sam considerable Hell fire for their wickedness. At the close of the meeting I met with the Missionaries again President Young made a few remarks to them upon their organization. we then went into our Prayer Circle & Presi-dent Young feasted the Breathrens upon Peaches & grapes as we had so many meetings we had had no time for Eating through the day at the close of the prayer Capt Van Vleit met us at the close of the Stairs & said he had an express from the states & wished to meet with Gov Young I then went to the Historians office & prepaired [FIGURE] 3 letters to I. F. Carter to O. Pratt & T. B. H Stenhouse I then went to Capt Hoopers & met with Capt Van Vleit a short time after President Brigham Young H C Kimball D. H. Wells A. Carrington O Hyde J Taylor & a number of others. Capt Van Vleit was preparing to leave at 3 oclok in the morning President Young was now to have his last interview with him & he wished to talk to him in a plain manner He said 
 He wished Capt Van Vliet to report at Washington Just as things were here He said I have seen the suffering of this people through the Persecutions of the people of the United States for the last 25 years and I will not bear it any longer. we have always treated the United States officers well but they have constantly lied abo-ut us & tried to destroy us all the time. we would still have received their govornors & officers if they had sent them here without an Army but inasmuch as they are now disposed to send an Armey here to hold us still while others run their read hot Iron into us & then kill us we will now say that we will not have neither their soldiers Armies or officers any more here at all, and you may tel them so we will Just fight for our liberty & rights from this day forth whenever I think of letting their troops come in here and their officers I can see nothing but death & darkness before me and before this people but when I say they shall not come here light bursts upon me and I can see life before me & thispeople and this is the way all of this people feel. the intention of the Government is to destroy us & this we are determin they shall not do. If the government of the United States persists in sending Armies to destroy us in the name of the Lord we shall conquer them. if the Government calls for volunteers in Calafornia & the people turn out to come to destroy us they will find their own buildings in flames before they get far from home & so throughout the United States again if they commence the war I shall not hold the Indians still by the [w]rist any longer for white men to shoot at them but I shall let them go ahead & do as they please and I shallcarry the war into their own land and they will want to let out the Job before they get half through and even should an Armey of 50000 men get into this valley when they got here they would find nothing but a Barren waste weshould burn evry thing that was wood & evry acre of grass that would burn and you may tell them that they must bring with them their forage for their animals for they will not find any thing to eat in this Territory when they come, again you may tell them they must stop all emigration across this continent for they cannot travel in safety the Indians will kill all that attempt it. You maytell Judge Douglass that when He comes here again to enter into a treaty of peace we shall dictate those terms of peace & not him as He did before.Capt Van Vleit said that  if our Government pushed forward this thing & made war upon us He should withdraw from the Army for he would not have a hand in sheding the Blood of American CitizensAfter closing HeHis remarks President Young said God had set up his kingdom upon the Earth & it was here & the Lord would sustain that kingdom & he would destroy all that fought against it And if the Armies of the United [States] came against us the Lord would permit them to be destroyed at the close of the remarks the President said to Capt Van Vleit as citizens we are friends & shook hands in a Friendly manner and

The following conversation passed between President Young & Capt Van Vleit not before recorded in this Journal. Capt van vleit said I think that Congress will try to do all they can against you.

Congress could send out an inves-tigating committee to Kansas or any other place but to 
 Utah but upon the mere rumour of liars they could send out 2000 armed soldiers to Utah to destroy the people withoutinvestigating the subject at all. Capt Van Vleit said the Government may yet send out one to Utah & consider it policy before they get through with it.

He brought some Letters to the president & others. I stoped at the Globe a short time in conversation with Brother Clements who thinks that Allexander would surrender if he had an opportunity to do it in a way that He wouldnot be censured by the Government. The army is in a critical situation & destruction seems to await them let them do whatthey will 
 October 21, 1857 ~ WednesdayOct 21st Brother Atwood arived this morning with an express from Gen Wells & 2 letters from Col Allexander who closed his letter by saying that "He should not obey the Govornors orders & his final disposals of the troops would depend upon Grave consideration which I do not deem necessary to enumerate" (words without meaning) The messenger said that the 5th Regment had stoped near Bear River in tents, the 10th Regment had moved back on hams fork 5 miles with all the teams & baggage they were in the snow several inches deep the Brethren travelled several miles with the army the men were so week & cold they would wrap up in their coat & lie down in the snow to rest almost evry mile we cannot tell what the intentions of the officers of the Army are. President Young thinks that Col Allexanders intention is to come nearer our camp so that his men may desert. Robert Burton said that it was 80 miles from Allexanders command to the mouth of Echo Canyon President Young said Here are the officers around me I will call a council of war. I think it is best for Gen Wells to callin all his forces to Echo & there rest & not ride his Horses to death unnecessary but let the Enemy alone now & they will soon use themselves up keep a few to watch there movements & let them work & they will all soon be used up. Dr Hickman is with the 5th Regiment who are left & Allen & his companies are with the 10th Regiment. Heber Kimball Jr sent Col Allexan-der a doz onions & the Col said if he had any thing that Heber wanted He would send it to him. He asked Beaty why He tryed to stampede their animals and burn the grass He said we burn the grass to get a better crop next year. I spent most of the fore part of the day in reading the History of the death of Joseph & comparing John Taylors account with it some 7 or800 head of cattle were drove in about 12 oclok accompanied by some teamsters & soldiers they looked poor & hungry I spent a short time with President Young in the eveningOctober 22, 1857 ~ Thursday22nd I spent most of the day in ploughing I gleaned 17 Bushels of potatoes on 1 1/2 acres after my men had dug the ground over I spent the evening in the Historians office on Presidents Brigham Youngs HistoryOctober 23, 1857 ~ Friday23rd I spent most of the day in the office on Brigham Youngs History. President Young received a letter from Gen Wells, not much newsOctober 24, 1857 ~ Saturday24th I called upon President Young a short time Brothers Kimball & Lyman ^&^ Lorenzo Snow was also in a few remarks were made about the Armey Brother Brigham said that He was satisfied that we could live in this valley & raise crops and keep our enemies out it is not in their power to he overthrow us by the Help of God we can remain here & they can not conquer us I have reflected this thing over in my mind to see what way I could conquer this people if I was there And I cannot see but one way & that way they will not attempt to take The United States have spent three Millions of dollars this season to fit out an Armey to destroy us & 
 October 24, 1857 ~ SaturdayOct 24th And it has done us no harm But if I was going to attempt to destroy this people I should have let them have there post office and made One Millions of Dollars of Appropriation & given them all they asked for then spent annother Million in carrying in Gentiles & Merchandize &kept this up yearly untill I had filled the country with Gentiles but the Lord would not let them do this but I should know that I could not quer conquer them by forc & they will find it out. President Young got a letter to day from Gen Wells who says the Enemy have returned back on Hams Fork some 15 milesI had a company of men who were lying in camp from Toelle City call & Husk out 110 Bushels of Ears of corn for me I gave them One 10th for husking I spent most of the day on B.

The Lord is manifesting great wis-dom through President Brigham Young as a Prophet & leader in Israel He corrects the Errors of all his brethren in such a way it is clearly manifest in the Eyes of all the people.I attended the prayer Circle in the evening at 4 oclok Gen D H. Wells & Elders John Taylor & G A. Smith arived from the Head quarters of the Army met in council with us & spent some time in conversing upon the subjet of the war. President Young said I mean to send word to the United States that if they have sent troops here the cattle which we have taken I will give them credit for upon compound interest but I do not know that they have sent any they have not notifyed me officially any thing about it & I have no right to know any thing about it but shall treat them as a mobOctober 26, 1857 ~ Monday26th Brother Peter W Conover & Oliver Smith arived in this City this morning & called at Presidents Youngs office & brought the news from our Carson valley company they gave a Rehearsal of all their travels to carson Valley & Calafornia & back again which was Highlyinteresting the company of the Carson valley saints & those from Calafornia & Oregon were on the way to this City they had 160 fighting men with 2700 lbs of Ammuni-tion belonging to the Church & a great deal with private individuals & a large amount of Arms. all the Saints are coming from Carson valley they left ownly 2 Boxesof caps & 1 lb of powder in all Carson Valley they sold all their arms & ammunition to the Brethren for their places. President Young also received a letter from Gen Grant the Army werestill on hams Fork not desided which route they would yet take they had got the Chief waggon Master in custidyThe presidency and Twelve were in conversation all the fore noon at his office upon the subjet of the war. President Young said 
 Oct 26That the United States Govornment was looseing their Nation-al greatness & wisdom is departed from them and we need not have as much fear of them as we would of an Armey of Grass hoppers if they take away our charter from us & divide up our Territory it will be Unconstitutional as evry thing is they do against us. I told Brother Bernhisel that if they took away our charters to come immediately home as soon as He could & we would organize our State Government & fall back upon our original Boundaries. Our East Boundary shouldbe at Laramie the west the summit of the Siera Nevada & run to the pacific Ocean &c & we would defend it. John Taylor who sat in the Judgment seat Saith that was our legal Lawful & Legitimat right. President Young said I want Sanbernadeno & Carson valley to remain & not be disturbed for I want the people there to raisestock to supply us from time to time as we need. The U.S. may do as they please we will do as the Lord wants us. One young officer of the Army said that Old Jesus Christ could not keep him out of salt Lake City But they will find out who rules on Earth & in heaven. Another officer said the United States would wipe us out another year should they send an Army of 20000 men it would take more than 20 miles for their armey & train to move at all and the more there is off them the worse off they will be. Mr Ray called upon President Young and wished him to buy his goods. He told him his goods were a poor lot in camparison to Mr Bells yet if ^Br^ Hooper would buy him out He would back him up, president Young also told Mr Ray that He would give him a little council if He would take it. He told him to stop taking opium and Alchohol and stop your fears and hold up your head and be cheerful "Mr Ray I will now tel you the truth. The Gentile Merchants with yourself have been the means of Bringing on this present war you have been selling my Blood & the Blood of my Brethren from for Gold this I shall not put up with it any longer I shall not permit any Gentile merchant to do business in [the] territory after this year in the way they have we have been kind to them & I have been their friend & our people have paid them promptly & they should have been our friends & told the truth about us but they have not realized what they were doing.["] many other remarks were madeBrother Taylor said will not the armey go into winter Quarters & entrench themselves & remain untill they get help from the states. President Young said if an army comes to help them in the spring we will use up this army first & then we will use up the other before they get to the south Pass. In the spring we must ask Allexander what He intends to do inform him He must not stay there untill He gets rein-forcements in the spring and if they will not leave in the spring we will use them up first the best we can in 10 days we can put 2000 men around them which would soon use them up. I do not believe that they will have 500 fight-ing men in the spring. They are in a vary critical situ-ation they say they have no other way to get a living 
 f Oct 26for their families but to war. I think it is better to let the Army alone this winter they will die many of them and others desert & many be weakened with the scurvey & in the spring we will wipe them out if necessary if they do not go away. we do all of our Business in the name of Israel God and they in their own way. The whole matter can be sumed up in these few words we are here at home by our own Fireside while they are a great way from home I intend to send those teamsters to the south whare they cannot get Back to the Armey. I spent most of the day in the office & with the Presidency.October 27, 1857 ~ Tuesday27th I spent most of the day in the office in the Afternoon G. A. Smith A Lyman & myself spent an hour in conversing abut the war Brother G. A. Smith said He believed their Artillery could be taken with but little loss by rushing in the night into ther Encampment & about 20 men to each peace put on Larrietts onto the tongue & draw it off on horse back upon a gallop all being mounted on good Horses & before the enemy were prepared for defence their cannon would be leaving themI have sown 15 Acres of wheat my boys finished Harvesting this dayOctober 28, 1857 ~ Wednesday28th President Heber C Kimball called upon us at the Historians Office at 11 oclok & Read His History till 12 oclock then Presidents Young & Wells A Lyman & L Snow came in & all conversed upon the war till 2 oclok we had an express in from Box Elder with a report that soulders [soldiers] were at Fort Hall also one from the East saying that the Enemy had not moved for several days but were waiting for Col Johnson to come up with 4 companies of cavalry & 2 companies of infantry this is report. It was decided in council that General Wells John Taylor & Charles C Rich return to the Seat of war & take charge of the command. The following is a synopsis of the conversation President Young said if any officer comes to the Armey the Govornor or Judges & send word that they want to come in Just inform them that they are as near as they can come Had they have come without a military aray they could have come & not been molested but now they cannot come we will not have any cursed scoundrel forced upon us Jto Judge or rule over us and they shall not Come among us. If Johnson comes with troops & intends to come in I expect they will leave their baggage Battery & a company to guard it and come in on a forced march without it. Then we must not let them sleep but use them up as soon as we can work night and day & not let them sleep. Brother Wells thinks they are determined to try to come in. I have sent word that if General Harney is on the way to get into camp & kill him if Possible and take the Animals from Johnson if Possible &take charge of the goods train. President Young said I am glad of one thing ie this thing will be Just as the Lord wants it. If He wants them to come & get killed it will be so if He

 January 1, 1858 ~ FridayJan 1st 1858This is the first day of a new Year of 1858 It is avary plesant warm day, calm and serene, is it an omen of peace and serenety to Zion for a year to come. time mustdetermin. we live in a day and generation which is big with Events As the Church and kingdom of God advances to fulfillits destiny it carries in its train Events, and is accomplishinga work which is of the Deepest interes to all mankind whetherthe living or the Dead who have ever tabernacled or ever willtabernacle upon this the footstool of our God. All Prophets or Apostlesor inspired men of God who have written or spoken concerningthis Generation whether Recorded in Records revealed or sealedhave pointed out clearly the events as they have transpired and as they will transpire before our Eyes. It has nowbeen over 30 years since Joseph Smith the prophet received the gold plates from the Hand of the Angel Moroni from which Hetranslated the Book of Mormon And it will be 28 years the 6th day of next April since the first Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ was organized upon the Earth containing 6 membersThis little Branch of the Church like a small mustard seed hasbeen nourished by the hand of God through all of its difficultiesafflictions and persecutions, untill it is becoming the greatest offall herbs according to the parable of the Saviour who refered toit. It has continued to grow and flourish in the midst of a strong warfare and opposition of wicked men and Devils Untill it is growing into a kingdom in the midst of these moun-tains and Everlasting Hills as spoken of by Daniel and otherProphets. The Church and kingdom of God has had to wadethrough a scenery of persecution oppression and Blood inflicted upon her by the inhabitants of the United States from its firstcommencement up to the present time untill many have been slain and martered for their religion including the Prophet Joseph who was the founder of the Church in this dispensation who was shot in Carthage Jail with his Brother Hiram by a wicked and hellish mob. As the Church has increased so has the opposition increased against it untill the inhabitants of cities, towns, counties and states rihave ^a^risen up in their wrath determined to destroy the saints of God from off the Earth. The governors rulers and people have all been united in this persecution andinasmuch as the Saints of God continued to grow and thrive the whole United States Government with President James BucaBuchannan at there head have sent an Army of 2500 mento lay a foundation for our destruction. The Saints of God have prayed that the Lord would hedge up their way that they could not come into our valley to shed our Blood or that we need not shed their Blood and the Lord has heard the prayers of his saintsand has hedged up their way they came as far as Forts Bridger & supply on the East side of the mountains and there have to remain for the winter while we are still enjoying our homes and Firesidesin peace to all human appearance that Great Nation the United States with 25000000 of souls are determined to Expend their treasures & use their force for the Destruction of the Church and kingdom of God from of the Earth who are now dwelling in thes vallies of the mountains. But we trust 
 Jan 1stin God as we have done heretofore and now look forward withfeelings of Deep interest to the Events of 1858 Believing that God will preserve his saints and chastize his Enemies. The wicked know not what they do "Darkness covers the Earth and gross darknessthe people." "The Heathen rage and the people imagin vain things theysay let our Eye look upon Zion and let her be defiled" "but theyknow not the thoughts of the Lord neither understand they his ways" "The Lord will have them in derision, He will laugh at their calamity & mockwhen their fear cometh." Their destruction will come suddenly upon them as a whirl wind and no power can Deliver them. The measurewhich they have meeted unto the saints, and seek to bring upon themshall be meeted unto them again as a Nation, as states, counties, towns, cities, and families untill evry man who does not draw his sword against his Neighbor will be oblieged to Flee to Zion for safety And these things shall shurely come to pass for the Lord God has spokenit. Then prepare yourself O Land of America for the judgments ofthe God of Heaven await ^you^ and are nigh even at your doors For the Lordhath looked down from his Holy habitation and hath beheld all your wickedness and abomination and all the Evil designs of your hearts and all your secrets plans for the destruction of the Saints of the Most High, for all these things God will bring you into Judgmentand He will require the stewardship at the Hands of the President of the United States and at the Hands of the senators, and Represen-tatives, and Govornors, and Judges, and all the Rulers of the Land will all be heald responsible for the use they make of the liberties& blessings put into their hands and the whole people of the Land who Elect the officers of Government will be held responsiblefor the conduct of those officers as well as their own conduct in their dealings with the church and kingdom of God upon theEarth. Let us watch the signs of the times of 1858 And we shall find that the Lord will soon come out of his hiding place and inhis fury he will vex the Nation and in his hot displeasure he will begin to cut off the wicked and unjust stewards and appoint themtheir portion with hypocrites and unbelievers. Let the saints of God prepare for that which is to come[rest of page blank]

President Young conversed upon principle and said that all our sufferings in this life was for our good that we might learn the contrast between good and evil Jesus descended below all things that He might ascend above all things all men have to pass throug the same thLaw in order toreceive the same Glory. Enoch, Elijah, and Moses, who were translated will at some time have to pass through death because the Law is that all men must tast of Death and the Lord doesnot counteract his own laws or break them. Some are alarmed because so many of my family are sick But I haveas good a right to be sick as any body I would not wish to escape affliction, sickness, paine & sorrow no more than othersfor if we make a right use of them they will return usBlessings.Brother Charles Wandle related to President Young his life since he saw him told him sins & Errorshis sorrow and affliction and his missions, and that Hehad tried to reform &c He was now on hand to do any thing the servants of the Lord wanted President Young told him some Young women for wives as his first wife haddrawn him away and was opposed to poligamy and hadkept him away from the church a long time & had turnedto whoredom & had a child by another man He now had better let her stay in the Church states whare she now was.

 Feb 15 1858and appetites which principles I have endeavored to carry outin my life and if all men would do it it would be a great Blessing to them.In speaking upon Utah affairs Brother Wandle said that Brother Hunt Had a good deal of influence inthe Calafornia Legislature and He told them and their Senatorto Congress that He wanted them to appoint a Mormon forGovornor but their senator said that was an impossibility for President Buchanan had marked out his course in relation to theMormons and was resolved to carry it out and that was He was deter-mined to over throw the Latter Day Saints and their institutionslet it cost what it would and the president would do nothing in their favor and the government were determined to back himup in this they were determined to blot out the Church govern-ment from Utah and no power could help it. PresidentYoung said that God had helped it so far and he would continueto help it unto the End and they cannot Help themselves all the people want us killed and those that wright write in our favoramong the gentile Editors are full of sin and do not wish us well but they have a motive in view to accomplish the Lord puts thatmotive in their minds yet they will not honor or serve God oracknowledge his hand in any thing but the Lord will govern & controll them all Just as He pleases. When Capt Van Vleit was here He many times refered to the inexaustible overflowing treasuryof the United States and twenty five million of people and askedif we could stand against such a Government, and when He gotback he found an Empty treasury and the Government wantingto Borrow money I have no doubt but he thought of these things and marvelled of itFebruary 16, 1858 ~ Tuesday16th I spent a part of the day in the office I was in poor healthmany are taken sick through the whole territory with a kindof Deistemper or pestilence that almost evry one is taken withit contains chills fever, cold & caugh it confines people to therHouses for 3 or 4 days then they go about again but few if any of the saints die with itFebruary 17, 1858 ~ Wednesday17 I spent most of the day in the endowment house about 60received their endowments.

Govornor Young and Gentlemen I come asan ambassador from the Cheif Execative of our Nation and am fully prepared and duly authorized to lay before 
 Feb 25you most fully and definately the feelings and views of the citizensof our common Country and of the feelings of the execative towards you relating to the present position of officers of this territory and the armey of the United States now upon yor Borders and after giving you the most satisfactory evidences in relation to matters concerning you now pending I shall then call your attention and wish to enlist your sympathies in behalf of the poor soldiers who are now suffering in the cold & snows of the mountains and request you to render them aid and comfortand to assist them to come here and to bid them a Hearty welcome into your hospitable valley. Governor Young may I be permitted to ask a private interview for a few moments withyou Gentlemen please excuse my formality for a few moments they were about 30 minutes in secret session. they then returned to the room & Dr Col Kane Then said that capt Van vleit made a good report about us and used an influence to have the Armey stop East of Bridger and had done a great deal in our behalf you all look vary well you have built up a great empire here in a short time. He spoke upon our prosperity wheat Bread vegitables He was asked if Dr Bernhisel took his seat in congress He said yes he took his seat He was opposed by the Arkansaw members & a few others but they made fools of themselvesfor if he had been refused his seat it would have been a d[e]clerat-ion of war you have bourn your part manfully in this contest I was pleased to see how patiently the people took it. Govornor Young asked how the Presidents message was received the Dr said as usual in his appointments he has been cruelly impartial. So far he hasmade an excellent president. He has an Excellent cabinate they are more united and work together better than former cabinets have done. President Young said I suppose they are united in putting down Utah. Col Kane said I think not. Buchanan made one Balk in the spanish affair and in the Black warrior affairThe Cansas [Kansas] affair is not setled as yet and I hope it may growworse untill the people will take it in hand. In speaking of the money pressure he said it commenced with the failure of the Ohio Life insureance and trust company and then the Banks and other firms followed in their turn. Col Kane said I wish you knew how much I feel at home I hope I shall have the privilege of Breaking bread with these my friends. Gov Young said I want to take good care of you. I want to tell you one thing and that is the men you see here do not look old and the reason is they are doing right and are in the service of God and if men would do right they might live to a great age. thereis but few men in the world that have the great amount of Labure to do which I have I have to meet men evry hour in the day. I stand in the streets and do more business in an hour than Any president, King or Emperor has to perform in a dayI have to think for the people constantly. I think that you can endure more now than you could 10 years ago. if you had done as some men have you would now have been in yourgrave before now. Col Kane said that I fear that I canendure more than I could 10 years ago for I feel that my life dont pay and I feel like going away as soon as it is the will of God to take me 
 Feb 25President Young remarked I know to take this life as it is and as men make it it does not appear worth living in but I well tell you that when you see things as they areyou will find life is worth preserving and blessings will follow our living in this life if we do right. Now if God should say I will let you live in this world without any pain orsorrow we might feel life was worth living for butthis is not in the economy of God. we have to partake of sorrow affliction sorrow and death and if we pass throug through this affliction patiently and do right we shall have a greater reward in the world to comeI have been rob[b]ed several times of my all in this life and my property has gone into the hands of my Enemies but as to property I care no more about it than about the dirt in the streets ownly to use it as God wishes itBut I think a great deal of a friend a true friend an honest man is the noblest work of God and to live in such a society is a great Blessing but we shall live to enjoy that privilege. It is not in the power of the United States to destroy this people for they are in the hands of God and so are we and he will do with us as he pleases and if he does right God will preserve us. The Lord does many things which we would count as small things.A poor man came into my office I felt by the spiritthat He kneeded five dollars in money. I took it out of my pocket and gave it to him I soon after found a five dollar gold peace in my pocket which I did not put there. I soon found another this was put in my pocket bythe Lord or some agent. many think that the Lord has nothingto do with gold but he has charge of that as well as any otherelement. Brother Kimball said in Nauvoo if we had to leaveour Houses let then go we will go to the mountains and in a few years we will have a better City than we have here, this isfulfilled. He also said we will have gold and coin twenty dollars peaces and we came here formed a city andcoined the first twenty dollars peices in the United Statesand seeing the brethren poorly clad He said it would not be three years before we could by clothing cheaper in saltLake valley and before the time was out the gold digersbrought loads of clothing and sold them in our city at quarter price. He then said Brother Thomas the Lord sent you here and he will not let you die No you cannot dietill your work is done. I want to have your name live withthe Saints to all Eternity you have done a great work and you will do a greater work still. we then parted and went to our homesFebruary 26, 1858 ~ Friday26 I spent the day in the office Journalizing I had a social sit down in my hous with G.

At the close of our interview we called upon President YoungHe spoke of his interview with Col Kane last evening, andHe learned the following fiact in relation to his visit to us in 1846. That Maj Mitchel reported to President Polk that the Mormons were receiving large sums of Money from the BritishGovernment and they were conniving with the indians against the government But it was not Generally believed and some said we were a poor persecuted people and ought to be helped instead of being persecuted and it was proposed to give us a part of Kansas Territory which would have been done had it not have been for secretary Marey he said he would resign if it was done and finally when it was known that General Carney was friendly to us he was sent off and when Col Allen was appointed to take charge of the Mormon Battalion and he became our friendthe Doctors killed him Col Kane was sent out by the president to know the truth concerning us as a people and make a true report of it which he accomplished and done us good.

Mr Kinny sympathizes with us in our war but we have no war with any bodythe United States are making war upon a little handful of men they may make war as long as they please andif they drive us hard enough we will show them funand their has not been a more imbecil Government on Earth than President Buchanan has manifested duringhis administration if hise had set in his Chair and said not a word but remained as a monument and employeda Boy 10 years old to have done his his business he would havemanifested more wisdom than he has done. If you have any propisition to make to me I wish you to do it itn writing but with a strict understanding that none of us will ever go to that country, if we occupy that country we will do it with people from other country, they said they would make their proposition in writing these remarks are ownly a sketch of the Conversations which passed.

Col Kane is as good a Lawyier as we will findabroad and he sustained us in our course and said that it was the cream of creams. you have taken the right course and I want to have you keep inthe right. I would not have you had you taken anyother course for nothing. President Young said this is the reason why we have let the army aloneCol Kane said I have feared all the time that you would chew that whole Armey up.President Young said Gen Houston had it right whenhe said if you make war upon them you will get awfully whiped. But President Young said Buchanan is determined that it shall be war and Nothing but war He wished to be President now or never exspected to be. while speaking upon the subject oftreason and being tried for treason, He said toHosea Stout I want to have you get all the testimonyupon that subject you can to gether in the defenceI should show that I as the Governor of this Territ[or]y had a right to resist an armed force entering into this Territory In as much as the President of theUnited States gave me no notice of sending an army to this Territory or of removing me from office thenshow that the President of the United States had no rightto make war upon any states or Territory upon mere rumour untill investigating the subjectNow for the President to make use of the languagehe did in that Early stage to empl[o]y spies what usehad they for spies when their was No war, poorDevils they laid a plan to make war upon the people and not to make peace.Brother Box and Allen called in to report what theyfound in researches they saw they found good grass on the mountains but no water for stocks but in places snow was 15 feet deep, they found one pocket large enough to hide all the people in ProvoPresident Young said I will not be tried in a court by our Enemies while under their power it will be 
 May 25Settelled either amicably or by the rifle. President Young sent a Letter to Gen D. H. Wells. A company of Apostates left for the enemies camp an man on guard at Echo Canyon left his post and went into the apostate camp President Young said give him a pass and let him go with our enemies.

Mr Cooper called also, and said thathe was in the Musketoe country 9 months and that he found it a good country and would rather live theire than to in any other country. President Young said to Mr Cooper what could Mr Kenny mean or think of us to send to us as he has, does he think we are fools? The United Stateswould give millions of dollars to have us go to that country for then they could lay their hands upon us. I would not go to that country if it was covered 15 inches deep with gold and we owned it all. we are here and here we will stay in this Territory. He conversed one hour upon our faith 
 May 26policy and intentions. He said that President Buchanan wasnot a man to plan or lay wires or chalk out the way forthe prosperity of the Nation. If the whole Nation was boiled down into one man and he possessed the knowledgeof the whole I could teach him the principle of Law andGovernment for I know more than the whole of themPresident Buchanan has manifested the greatest folly ofin his official acts of any man that ever occupied the Presidential chair.

Soon Mr John Hartnett tSecretary came in was introduced to President Young & company it was the first time they had met.The following is a synopsis of the conversation that passed between them Col Allexander called yesterday & had a short interview and it was vary agreeable. President Young said 
 Aug 9thI was much pleased with him and am satisfyed that if he had the sole command of the Armey & I could have had three hours conversation with him all would have been right and they could have come in last fall as well as now. President Young asked Hartney how he liked the place. He said well ownly I dont like to go to Parawan to attend to the Legislature. It will be a pleasant ride for you through the snow. I had a plenty of that last winter. I went back to the states through the snow. I have been confined some 10 years years in the merchantile business and it was into[o] close confine-ment for my health the Journey to this country was an inducement for me to come that I might have more exercise. Mr Hartnett asked if our difficulties were not all setteled. B Y yes so far as they can be as far as I know. I have been driven 5 times from my house and home without any Just cause, this time I did not wish to be driven. The President of the United States has given us a good deal of Trouble, Buchanansent an armey to us & stoped all communication with ^us^ by stoping the Mail then laid a plan for our destructionHartney said I did not understand it so. B. Y said what did you suppose they sent an armey for. He said to guard the trains and protects the people against the Indi-ans &c, did you not believe that we had burned the court Records & broaken the United States Laws. He Answered I did, This was all fals, we have never opposed any good men who were attending to their own business but I have alway taken the Liberty to speak my mind freely upon any subject or the acts of wicked men who would act outrageous. Hartney said that He did not think that president Buchanan intended to have the army fight. He told me when he found that there was to be war that He was not willing to have any Blood shed untill He had sent out Peace Commission-ers sent to the people & try ^to^ make peace President asked why did he stop the Mail without any cause, they have stoped the mail several times when they were about to commence a persecution upon us they did it in Nauvoo. President Polk sent an Agent to demand 500 men of us in the wilderness & made arangements to have us destroyed if we did not comply. Gov Bogs Agent told me that the mormons were the best people He ever saw and if they would mingle with the people and do as we do all would be well but we did not feel disposed to do it and we were driven out of the state because of our religion, this Armey boasted all the while that they would kill our Edlders & take the women & do what they pleased with them. Hartney said I came with the army & did not hear such language as your people say was among them. No they would not say before you what they would among themselves I want the United States to let us alone & let us mind our own business & keep the Laws of God & the Constitution 
 Aug 9thof the United States as we always have done then our difficulties will be settelled as far as they canbe but this people will not be driven from these mountains we shall fight first. we do take the liberty to speak of the acts of men when they debasethemselves by their acts, but this People hold theConstitution of the United States sacred. Now should I speak about Judge Eckles who came & spent the winter in Green River Country & hadd a mob mo[ck]court before he took the oath of office & brought in Bills of Indictment against thousands of citizens who were innocent of crime Now if I was to speak about his acts they would accuse meof speaking against the Constitution of the United States & say I was guilty of treason No man can Justly find any fault with any of my official acts except the stoping of those trains and that I done to save the sheding of BloodAugust 10, 1858 ~ Tuesday10th I called at the office in the Afternoon called upon President Young in the evening with BrotherWheelock & spoke to the president about Holding publick meetings on the business of the AgriculturalSociety He did not wish meetings called uponany subject.

When Col Kane came to visit usHe tried to point out a line of Policy for me to persue but I told him I should not turn to the right or left or persue any course ownly as God dictated me Ishould do nothing ownly what was right and when he found that I would not be influenced ownly asthe spirit of the Lord led me he felt discouraged &said he would not go to the armey But He finally saidif I would dictate he would execute I told him as he had been inspired to come here he should go to the armey and do as the spirit led him to do and all would be right and he did so and allwas right. He thought [it] vary strange because we werenot afraid of the armey I told him we were not afraid of all the world if they made war upon us the Lordwas able to deliver us out of their hands and would do it if we did right. God controlls all of these matters. Now when the armey was cominghere there were many Indians who come hereand wanted to fight the soldiers I would notEmpl[o]y them this made many of them madand they Joined the soldiers and wanted tofight us. If they had commenced war againstthe United States it would have been a general war they would have destroyed the western cities. Br Kimball said that Col Kane askedwhat would be the result of he spoke against the Mormons Brother Kimball told him his mind would become Barren and he could not do any good but would droop & die away but as long as you will stand up for the truth you will be fruitful and feel well. Elder Kimball saidthat the day would come when our boys who arenow riding around the street will be inspired to dosome of the greatest things you ever heard of thesubject of the three Esstates was spoken off Br Kimball said that he believed that those who werevaliant in the first esstate would be in this & wouldbe crowned in glory in the next the day is athand when things will be done here on Earthas it is done in heaven then Enoch will come and fall upon our necks & we upon his & we shall kiss each other.

Brother Brownell was vary stubborn & itwas finally dicided to cut him off from the Church if Hedid not make confession next Sabbath the whole branchvoted for this measure. Brownell called upon Brother Wells to get council upon it Brother Wells told him it would do him no hurt to humble himself & make a confes-sion as he was required. President Young said I haveoften thought of the words of Solomon that a wise childwas Better than an old and foolish king I could pickout many Boys in this Church 16 years old more fitfor Bishops than many old men who are Bishops thereare but few men who seem calculated to make BishopsThe Brethren then went to Willow Creek to settle aDifficulty with Elder A Cordon the President & BishopDives there were three or Four charges brought againstBrother Cordon but when they were all investigated theydid not amount to any thing as a fault all the Branch voted to sustain him as President the Bishops councellorfor the men who accused him four of his accusers were cut off from the Church. The people did not like to votefor Bishop Dives unless he would go by the council givenhim He had it was said that the Bishop had a watch whichhe carried that was tithing property & a cow they had milkedall summer & No credit given on the tithing Books &cthese matters were not much investigated. President Young said the Twelve should look into all such matters& regulate them. He asked if they saw any body therethat would make a Bishop they said No without itwas Elder Cordon. O Hyde thought He knew muchmore than Bishop Dives. President Young said Heis not calculated for a Bishop He is a good man fora President and in spiritual things But was not calcu-lated for a Bishop. Their is anoth[er] thing Lorenzo Snowpresides over that region & is a prudent wise man yet hehas strong pregudices & does not pull on the same strings thatI do there has been a kind of a spirit to keep DivesDown But I believe if he had had the sole controll of things there as the president opened the meetings & preachedto the people He would have made a good smart preacherBut I never saw the man that was kept down by hissuperiors that could rise above it John Taylor askedwho is the greatest the President or the Bishop. President Young said the Bishop should attend to his own business& let the Presidents alone & the Presidents should attendto his Business & let the Bishops alone, but they should 
 Nov 2ndThe President should say to the Bishop can I do any thing for you & the Bishop should say to the Presidentcan I do any thing for you & they should mutuallyhelp each other.

 Nov 13Young then addressed the People for the first time since theArmey of the United States had entered our valley he gavemuch good teaching instruction & reproofin the Afternoon Joseph Young spoke followed by O Hyde thenMembers were cut off from the ChurchI met in the evening at President Young with the Legislaturean arangement was made by the members to assemble at the socialHall on the 2nd Monday in Dec & organize & adjourn to Fillmore thiswas done to sustain our own acts then at Fillmore we would organ-ize to Accomodate Gov Cummings as he considered that the Seat of Government then we would adjourn back to Great Salt Lake Cityto spend the session to accomodate all parties. Gov Cummings thought our adjournment to Great Salt Lake City was illegal because it wasdone by a Joint resolution of both Houses in Joint Session he consideredit not of the same validity as an act in separate houses he was informedthat several of the states in the Union was received & admitted intothe Union by a Joint vote of both Houses of Congress and we establi-shed the seat of Government at Filmore by a Joint resolution of bothhouses & if our removal of the seat of Government to Great Salt Lake City was not legal then the esstablishment of the seat ofGovernment at Filmore was not legal Hence we have no seat ofGovernment. It is a singular argument of Gov Cummings that the unanimous vote of the two houses in Joint sessionweakens the power of Legislation & is not of the same force & validity that it would be if passed in separate Housessuch an argument contains neither force or powerNovember 14, 1858 ~ Sunday14th Sunday The conference met at 10 oclok.

I wouldtake my wives & wives children & go to some secluded spotof Earth whare I could enjoy my wives & children & liberty"What if the Government should pounce onto you & not give you theprivilege? then I would take my family into the mountains& I would fight you over evry hill & dale as long as I livedCapt Woolf replyed I will not shoot at you.

I called upon the president at 2 oclok Brother Sharp came in & gave an account of the row at Kinkades last night He said that He was in it from first to last Mr Charles Kinkade was at the head of the row He tried to provoke a Quarrel with the Poliece they made all kind of noises to attempt the police to arest them but the police did not interfere with them untill they cameout & kicked & stoned the poliece they then knocked down some half a dozen of them several shots were exchanged but nobody killed the Poliece quelled the mob several of which were severely hurt one asked for two poliecemen to guard him while He wento to Mr Hartnets to get Dr Hurt to come & dress the wounds of those who were hurt two policemen went with him & while returning with Mr Hartnet one of the poliecemen pistol accidentally was discharged & the ball went into the ground this Frightened Mr Hartnet for He thought He was shot at But He was informed that it was an accident the Gentiles are vary anxious to get up a row with this people.

 Nov 24The Mayor A. O. Smoot had an interview with Govornor Cummings who thoroughly sustained the poliece in their course with the mob on Monday night he told Brother Smoot that the ownly fault he foundin the whole affair was that they did not notify him that He might be on the ground to met the mob & head the battle Himself for it was better for theresponsibility to come upon him than upon themayor & poliece of the City. He said he had had [FIGURE] an interview with the Judges & Civil officers of the US court & they asked him for a posse to takeBrigham Young before the court & asked for council He told the Judges he would advise them to rulein court that when any man wished to subpoena a man to come before the court that the man should make an Affidavit that the person was an Essential witness & state what he wished to prove by him& send it to the man before he forced him to appear Judje Sinclair thought favorable of it butCradle Baugh swore he would not submit to it. Judge Sinclair said he would not esstablishing rulings in his court without notifying the Govornor of it Govornor Cumings said he should not think it good policy to esstablish Forcible measures in Forceing Brigham Young to& others to appear in court on evry frivolous case & even not at all untill the character of the United States courts had been better esstablished in this Territory than they had heretofore for you all know damned well that the people Here have not been vary civilly or lawfully treated in many instances by dignitaries, and during the present excited state of things I think it would be policy to take pacific measures & not try to create disturb-ance among the people. He told Brother Smoot that if there was any more mobing in the street He ment to take the Booll by the Horns himself I do not wish to get into rows but the police shall not be driven out of these streets they shall be maintained in the discharg of their duty The court is resolved to Bring out Brigham Young before them on a subpoena as a witness in the case of Burr Govornor Cummings felt troubled about it more than any thing He had met with fearing President Young would not comply but all things will be right The Mayor made arangements to move the court to the social HallNovember 25, 1858 ~ Thursday25 I spent most of this day in preparing for the funeral [FIGURE] & the burrial of my Child which I buried in the firstlot on the south side of the road after passing through the west gate of the Burying ground it is the third grave visible some graves have been dug up in making a road

Campbell & Joseph A Young we agreed upon the arangment of the Alphabet to have it stand perpendicular also to print the first Book in the Deseret Alphabet & to print some in each Number of the Deseret News. President Young has laboured unceseingly to esstablish the Deseret Alphabet & have it taught in our schools. Judge Sinclair ruled that [since] they had sit in court but 7 days instead of nearly 60 that He should not count time ownly while sitting in court The Deseret News published the procedings of the court which has made the Judge & his party quite mad.November 26, 1858 ~ Friday26. We have a hard snow storm this morning I spent the day in the office scrapingNovember 27, 1858 ~ Saturday27th It is a cold day I spent the day in the office scraping& preparing matter for the deseret Alphabet.

It is a Historical fact that treson did exhist in this Territory it is equally a Historical fact that all treason which exhisted in this Territory was pardoned By James Buchanan the President of the United States & By the Govornor of this territory and the 
 Nov 29Grand Jury have no business to enquire into any thingbefore the leaving of the pease commissioners left this territory neither the Judge or Jery has nothing to do withany thing that transpired before that event so this ends the matter of trying to bring up Brigham Young on treasonJudge Sinclair ruled that Green river county was notin his Jurisdiction.

 While the Quorum of the Twelve met in there pray[er] circlethe conversation turned upon the subject of the dictation of the spirit of God & the great importance of followingthe dictation of that spirit in all our lives. President O Hyde said he had often found it difficult to dissern betwen the dictation of the spirit of the Lord and his own desires in things which he wished accomplishedO Pratt said that a few days since while praying forthe preservation of his family it came forcibly to his mind about taking care of one of his boys whohad broaken one of his arms but he put off the imp-ression & in less than two hours he broak his arm again. W.

It has been an eventful year a year in which the hand of God has been made more visible than in any other period during the present Generation, some of the greatest events have transpired during the past year ever manifest among men. the successful laying of the submarene Atlantic Telegraph by which communication has been made between two continents by means of an electrict wire on the bottomof the Atlantic Ocean is the most steupendious work ever achieved by man. Europe & America have made liberal treaties with China & Jappan which have opened theirports to the trade, commerce & intercourse with the whole world which have been heretofore entirely closed up for thousands of Generations. The Emperor of Russia has laid the foundation for the liberation of millions of surfs from a species of slavery which has existedfor sCentauries. The inhabitants of British India have risen in their wrath to throw off the British yoke and rivers of Blood as it were has been caused to flow in thatland and the spirit of war has been poured out upon all Nations and France & other Nations have been arming & preparing for a Deadly conflict. The whole Earth is becoming corrupt before God, wickedness and abominations are rapidly increasing throughout all Nations The Gospel of Jesus Christ has beeen offered to all Nations By the Elders of Israel whareever they could get access to the people and the world in a great measure have rejectedthe Gospel and the Lord is with holding his spirit from the 
 inhabitants of the Earth and the people are waxing worse & worse and are becomeing filled with all manner of lying deceavings robing whoredoms, murders Blasphemies & wicked-ness of evry kind. Yea Emperors, Kings, Princes, Lords Presidents Govornors Judges and all the Ruellers of the whole Earth as well as the people have become so corrupt before God that He is angry with them and the Lord is begining to visit them with war & bloodshed & with pestilence tempest thunder lightning & great hail, whirlwinds & devouring fire this is plainly manifest in our own Nation even the United States which is corrupt above all other Nations, they have sought the destruction of the Saints of God in this land but the Lord has faught the battles & preserved his saints The Lord hath done ^it^ his work has been visible before our eyes and we will acknowled[ge] his hand therein. The United States Govorment sent fourteen thousand men including souldiers& teamsters to Utah to put to death Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball Daniel H. Wells The Twelve Apostle & other leaders of the Church, they travelled One thousand Miles & expended some thirty Millions of Dollars to accomplish this evil design even to shed the Blood of the Lords aniointed. But the Lord Hedged up their way they had to spend the winter in the snows of the everlasting rocky mountains and live upon the flesh of their animals and when they did enter our valies and cities it was by the permission of the prophets & saints of God for whom they had come one thousand miles to slay, and instead of haveing the privilege of sheding the Blood of the Prophets in Utah but vary few of them have been permitted to behold their faces. President Buchannan also sent Judges & officers to this territorywho are filled with wickedness, madness and abominations of evry kind, they have also laid secret plans to destroythe prophets & bring distress upon the people by their decrees from the Judgment seat but the saints have called upon the Lord in mighty prayer & the Lord has heard & answered them & he has taken away the wisdom of the Judges and their power and their folley is manifest in the eyes of the people and the power of God is manifest in all these things and he has preserved his Prophets Church & Kingdom, against all the wrath of the President, Congress, their armies, Judges and all the Devils who enter into the tabernacles of men to fight against God & his saints Judge Sinclair has held an open United States DistrictCourt tofrom the 4th day of Oct. up to the last of Dec being 88 days and tried all in their power to get up some action against Brigham Young & the leaders of the Church but have accomplished a solumn Nothing ownly tried to persecute James Furgerson & have notbeen enabled to do much of that for the Lord has held them so fast that they have not been enabled to accom-plish any evil plan which they have laid. The God of Israel hath laid the foundation of his church and kingdomupon the Earth in these last days & he has guided it by his Almighty power up to the present day he has preserved his saints in the midst of all the ware fare against them
