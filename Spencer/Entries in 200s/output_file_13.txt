The interests of the Company are specially protected by the German Imperial governement, through a resident diplomatic agent at Constantinople, the amount of german capital engaged in the undertaking being so enormous, and the enterprise itself, from an economic point of view of such vast importance to Germany. The construction of the line will develop the immense natural resources of ancient Mesopotamia, the valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris, and it is of the utmost importance to the enter- prise that those regions should be settled by an intelligent and enterprising class of people. One of the directors of the company, who is also a director of the Deutsche Bank at Berlin, and a valued friend of mine, has asked me the question, whether I thought it advisable to invite the attention of the authorities of your church to the grand opportunity offered here for the formation of mass-settle- ments, and requested me to write this confidential letter to you.

Dr. Siemens is familiar with the great work done by the Mormon people in Utah, and is of the opinion, that like results, if not greater, could be accomplished in Asia Minor, under a more tolerant and more sympathetic government. The lands lying contiguous to the Anatolian Railway are chiefly under personal control of the Sultan, and the railway company would undertake to obtain grants from  him for settlements. Dr. Siemens assured me that the turkish government and the Sultan personally are in favor of the development of that region and will do everything that is necessary and within reason to foster it.  In case you should take the remotest interest in the suggestions made, and desire to be further informed I shall be pleased to communicate with the proper authorities on the other side.

We Believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.  2. We believe that men will be punished for  their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.  3. We believe that through the attonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.  4. We believe that these ordinances are: First, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost.  5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by "prophecy, and by the laying on of hands," by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.  6. We believe in the same organization that ex- isted in the primitive church, viz: Apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.  7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, etc.  8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.  9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that he does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.  10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes. That Zion will be built upon this contenent. That Christ will reign personally upon the earth, and that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisic glory.  11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Al- mighty God according to the dictates of our conscience and allow all men the same privilege, let them wor- ship how, where and what they may.  12. We believe in being subject to kings, presi- dents, rulers and magistrates, in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law.  13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, be- nevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to ALL MEN: indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul. "We believe all things, we hope all things," we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things.

It would be almost impossible under the  present circumstances for me to leave by July 16th. The Ward and City Records which I have now in my possession are very far behind,  the former being about 2 years beghind on  account of failure of my predecessor who  has not his work finished.
