[##Joshua 6:15-21##] The Seven Lights on the plate is to represent the   High Priest that marched seven times going round the   walls of Jericho; & bore along with them the Tabernacle  & took its rise from the th time of Joshua, when the Israelites   had gained possession of the land of Canaan, by the overthrow   of Jericho, which was utterly destroyed; for the Temple ^tabernacle^ with   the Ark was then in Gibeon, & kept there untill the final dedication   of the Temple by King Solomon, & -------- was the word that King Solomon   expressed by smiting his breast three times, when so and so was   missing from the Temple &c [##1 Kings 8:3-63##]    And God said let there be light and there was light [##Genesis 1:3##]  And the light shineth in darkness ^but^ and the darkness comprehendeth it not.

The prodigiousness of the work may be understood by the  number of the men employed in this structure, their  being 10,000 men per month in Lebanon to hew down  timber; 70,000 to carry burdens, 80,000 to hew the  stones, & 3,300 overseers who were all employed for secven  seven years.      There was another edifice built over  the Temple of the same dimensions with itself & makes  the whole height 120 cubits, and the whole building  was of free stone, so exactly joined, that it seemed  to be one entire solid rock, growing there of its own  accord; this Temple was encompassed with a wall of three  cubits high to exclude the profane multitude & admit  none but the priest, & it was called Gison; without  covered with gold, & all the people that were purified might  enter here. and from the ramparts which supported the wall  was 800 cubits on the top equal to a common place, or two  foot & a half, & the length of the ramparts below was 1,000 cubits  the bredth 100 cubits & the highth 300 cubits, the stones of  which they were built were 40 cubits long 25 broad & 8  high those were all of marble cut with saws & so exactly  joined as to decieve the eye & looked all like one stone, the  pillar of parinan marble was 1,453 joined to the walls of 
 they were of stone so thick as three men could scarcely  fathom them; none less than fifteen cubits & of the Corinthian  order, beautiful to a wonder; the windows bends those  in the pavement to let light into the appartments under  ground were 2,246 & the length of the wall which inclosed  the Temple was 3,081 cubits, and six cubits & a hands breadth  thick, and betwixt this wall & the porch of the gentiles, was 37 1/2  cubits broad, & 768 cubits long. In the middle of the  Temple there stood the House of God, & was encompassed with  its own wall 100 cubits broad & 250 long & the gates were  covered with gold 13 cubits high & 8 broad, the bredth of the  Tower was 64 cubits the hights to the cornor stone were  125 cubits & the holy place 12 cubits high & 20 broad &  40 long 2 1/2 thick without any windows which divided the sanctuary  from the Holy of Holies; in this structure were 732 chambers, &  most all of them square; & none less than 12 cubits of extent  but many of them much more, there were many appartments  under ground as kitchens, sacred & profane, also a large store  house for the first fruits of Israel, & a vast Hall over the Sanctim  Sanctorium whare the Tables, curtains & the rest of the instru-  ments of the Tabernacle, & sacred offerings were kept. The beams  were 12 1/2 cubits long, 1 1/5 thick, all of cedar, 1 7/8 broad, with  sculptures carved work, and gold plates; the floor of the  whole structure was paved with stones of various colours,  very precious, & so artifilly artificially laid in chequirs work  that they looked like one entire stone; the walls, roof & floor  of the sanctuary were all covered with plates of fine gold, 
 joined by golden nails the heads of which were of curious  workmanship, each of those nails were 25 ounces of gold, with  most precious jewles jewels, of various coulours, set in & stone like  the stars in the firmament. There belonged to the Temple 440,000  vessels of gold and 1,340,000 of silver, which took up 108,000 talents  and 2,000 shekels of gold, in the whole amounting to 1,817,654,024  Roman gold crowns, & of silver a million of talents, which  is 1,465,480,000 more such crowns; all this was consecrated to  the Temple, besides what was laid out on the wages & food of the  workman & other materials. The reduction of a Roman gold  crown, which is about six shillings in English a peace, the gold amounts  to five hundred & forty millions, two hundred & three pounds ninty  & six thousand, & two hundred & three pounds, four shillings. Sterling;  and the silvers came to four hundred & thirty nine million,  three hundred & forty two thousand pounds Sterling. The weight  of the brazen alter was 2,000 talents; & that of the Brazen Sea  8,640. The roof of the Temple, being covered with plates of  Brass, comes to 500,141 talents, and 103 pounds weight. The two  brass columns or pillars, called [blank] and [blank] at the enterance  of the Sanctuary weighed 19,027 talents, & being covered  with gold of an inch thick it amounted to 5,850 talents  of gold. [##1 Kings 7##] Solomon employed in building the Temple 401,900  Israelites, the same number of Lydonians, also Tyrians  & Egyptians, to each of whom, besides their daily wages and  diet, he gave when the Temple was finished, ten shekels of  gold. [##1 Kings 5:13-16##] Solomon also gave the King of Tyre's household,  yearly, 20,000 ears or measures of wheat, each containing  eight bushels & a half, Winchester measure, & twenty measures [##1 Kings 5:11##] 
 of oil, & 75 wine gallons, & alone five pints each, which  was the contents of the [ear] for liquids; he gave them likewise  20,000 measures of wine, of the same contents. He gave the King  of Egypt as much; and the Tyrian workman all, yearly,  120,000 measures of wheat, and as many of Barley; so that  all the workmen had evry year, 602,850 measures of  wheat, & as many of Barley; so that all the workman  had evry year besides 602,850 measures of wine, & the  like quantity of oil &c. [##1 Kings 5:11##] He gave likewise to Hiram King of  Tyre, 20 towns in Galilee, & a gold pillar of great value. [##1 Kings 9:11##]  Villopandus says there never was such a magnificent  structure on earth as the Temple built by King Solomon;  the gold & silver vessels consecrated to the use of the Temple, came  to one thousand & nine one million, five hundred fifty one  thousand & two hundred & three pounds four shillings, besides the  gold plates with which the walls, roof, & pavement were lined; the  gold nails & jewels above mentioned are not valued. He gave  as a free gift to the workman, six millions, seven hundred,  sixty three thousand & seventy seven pounds; besides their daily  wages & diet which are not valued, nor have we any valuation  of the Brass & other materials made use of in the building. V  Villapandus reckoned the jewel to excede this sum. Josephus expresses  4 hundred & 40 thousand gold vessels, & thirteen hundred & forty thousand  of silver for the use of the Temple = Ten thousand priests vestments  of silk with purple girdles & two million of purple vestments for  the singers. The Treasure left by King David towards building  the Temple one thousand eight hundred & seventeen million  six hundred fifty four thousand & twenty four Roman crowns of gold  Page 5 
 they were suffered therefore to be forbid; and in ##Exodus 28:4|Exod.   Chapt. 28##, saying these are the garments which they shall make,  this they say excludes all that are not here named, & Moses  being commanded at the burning bush to put off  his shoes, for the ground on which he stood was Holy,  for the same reason— because of the extryaordinary  presence of God then in that place, they make a further  argument for it. [##Exodus 3:5##] For say they, the Temple was all Holy,  for the same reason, that is because of the extraordinary  presence of God, then residing in the Shekinah over the  Mercy Seat, (this was the sacred name) & for further  reasons, it was most strictly exacted, that the priest should  ^be^ always barefoot in the Temple, but the Jews & eastern Nations  uncover their feet, that no dust or pollution might   profane the Holy ground. [##1 Kings 8:10-11##] Herne [Herein] pulling off a shoe among  the ancients, indicated reverence for the presence of God.  The customs was also expressive of the covenant of a bargain,  or covenant amongst the eastern nations; the party  conveying away a right or privilege, took off a shoe &  gave it to his fellow, as a pledge of his fidelity.      Amongst the Jews it was a token of renunciation, thus the  kinsman of Ruth renounced his claim upon her in  favor of Boaz; she loosed his shoe from his foot to show  she was released from all engagements by which the laws  of the country, had bound her to the claims of her nearest  relations &c, &c.

 Franklin, Idaho, June 18 1889    Pres. Wif^l^ford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Bro:    Your favor notifing me  that I have been called to  leave Salt Lake City on Aug. 14th;  for Great Britian on a mission  is at hand and noted.    In reply I have but to  say that with the help of the   Lord I will be on hand as  per your instructions    Your Bro. in the Gosple,    Chas. England    S. S. Hatch Bishop 
 Their are things in Embrio which will try this people & those Events will   ripen as theis dPeople do and all will have to get the spirit & Revelations of   Heaven in order to stand, & thes things will be among all Nations &  know it as well as I knew it would be a hard winter. I want you  to wake up yourselves & then wake up your wives & Children & stop your lying   & stealing & take that Burthen upon your Backs which belong to you then the  Presidency & Twelve will ownly carry their own burthens. The time has come  or is near at hand when many that have trifled with the priesthood & the  things of God will be destroyed & go to Hell cross lots & those who are  not faithful in magnifying the priesthood it will be taken from them  & given to others and that quickly and I know it for Angels, Prophets,  & Holy men say it & it will be fulfilled.      As to danceing I am tiered of it  I never want to see another man dance untill he can do it by the power of  God. I felt that spirit once & Brother Brigham shouted Hosanna for we was  both filled with the spirit Neither do I want to see any more feasting   at present. I dont want to see any more Jealous feelings some of  our Bishops get Jealous of the servants of God no man would be if  He was filled with the Holy Ghost. I would chastize a man if He stood in   my way when I knew that I am a messenger sent of God. President   Young says if the people do not do right He will not stay long with  them but shall go the other side of the veil if He goes I shall not  stay long behind him because we will not have one between us   and if you dont do your duty we shall go soon I have had many  men try to stand between me & president Young & when I have  been to see him many have snubed me but I have seen enough of   this. And that man that will try to do it He must look out   for God & his angels will smite him. I have no objection to men   coming to President Young to comfort him & do him good & when  he gives them a wife give him $10 or $20 dollars according as He  may value his wife. But men must not try to separate us if they   do they will be cursed I understood that Brother Woodruff got   a whiping from one of them lately But I tell you that although  He is a small man He is all gold & you will find it so in the end  & you may be thankful to ever get as good a place as He will get   for he is the pure gold & I wish you would get as good as He is  the Bishops will not repeat what the missionaries say for they  are Jealous. But if you will get the spirit of God upon you there   will be no Jealous feelings in your heart. you want the spirit   of God & the power of the priesthood to rest upon you as it did   upon Joseph & does upon the Presidency & Twelve. take that priesthood  upon you which belongs to you & magnify it. The Missionaris  want to wake up then wake up the Bishops & then wake up the   people & all live your religion & all will go well and if you   will live up to your priviliges here & get the spirit of this refermation   it will reach all over the Earth & go to the ends of the Earth & the wicked   will not have power over us but this work will go from Zion through  all the world as the sap of a tree will go from the trunk to the end of evry   limb & twig. I want to see the power of God among this people that   they may have faith to remove mountains if necessary but the power   of God will ownly increase as the spirit of God increases among the people  if we will do our duty ^&^ if the United [States] should be the aggressers the Lord   would say if they came against us Let my servant Brigham send 200   men & they would lick them up, for God would assist to fight our  Battles with the storm hail & snow, & they would be destroyed. I know  this would be done but we must get the faith of the Ancients     
 As to Brother Brigham Young I have to say that He is just as good a man as  ever was on Earth. Now wake up Brethren & see that you purify  yourselves before you try to purify others then go forth & lift up your  voice like a trumpet & call upon all men to repent get full of the  Holy Ghost & there is not a man that will do it but what will be filled  with Prophesyings as were the ancient Nephites, and little Boys 4 years  old will prophesiey. I do not wish to go to a feast or a dance until this  people reform. and when there is men enough here to bring forth  this refermation & men will not prosper untill they do their duty  to God & each other. I have no desire to attend any recreation untill  this people are filled with the spirit & power of God & I do not  think that President Young has. if you will rise up & do your duty  you will be blessed & no man that rises up against us in this place  will prosper if we do our duty & we wash our feet against them  I believe in washing our feet against our Enemies.  The spirit of God   has been upon us for more than a year & the people would play laugh &  trifle about it but if they had the spirit of God & done their duty they would  have seen it this has been my feelings all the time I have felt that the  people were trifling with the things of God. Brother Jedediah is fallen a  mighty man is taken from us but his power is here it still rests upon  Brother Brigham & myself & when we lay hands upon ^another^ [m] man the spirit   of God & of Jedediah will rest upon him in full force that he may do the  work & fill his place as a counciller to the president & I know it May God   Bless you Amen      Elder F. D. Richards followed in bearing testimony R L Campbell took minutes  He was followed by C. H. Wheelock Joseph Hovey G. D. Grant D. D. Hurt  & savage then Brigham Young said why we take the Elders for Missionaries  who have just came in is that we can set them to work while their   armour is on for it has generally been the case that soon after the Elders  come in they throw down their armour & some are so far left to  themselves they do not enjoy the spirit of God. In answer to the   question of Brother Savage about people restoring what they hav stolen {from [illegible]}   in the first place I would say I would not steal but whare it cannot be  restored I would say put it into the P[erpetual] E[migration] Fund to gather poor for I would   not have any thing to do with it       A. H. Raleigh then spoke after   which Hopkins Pender, John M. Jones, & Joshua Midgeley were   called to go out on Missions. The Bishops with ther council the High Priest  & their council, The First Presidency of the 70s & the Presidents of Elders priests  Teachers & Deacon all are requested to meet with the Missoionaries in   this place on Monday evening each week. Benediction by Jacob Gates      December 9, 1856 ~ Tuesday      Dec 9th I spent the day in the office writing the reports of Last Evening  I attended meeting with the Bishops I herd Bishop Hunter speak followed   by L. W. Hardy A. H. Raleigh & E. D. Woolley & I made some remarks      [FIGURE] {President Young gave me the following and said keep this to yourself [It was] a list of names of persons and families as seen by J M Grant [in a dream or vision]. He began by saying oh the destruction that is coming [shortly/assuredly] upon this people. It will begin at Carson Valley. Orson Hyde will be destroyed and part of his family. Colonel and Enoch Reese will be destroyed and many others in that place. The next that will be mentioned was going to be cut root and branch. Next was Orson Pratt and part of his family.

President  Young was poorly & not able to be out so Elder Hide went in to see him.

Elder Hyde travelled through snow from 1 to 3 feet deep   during the last 200 miles no path ownly what we made ourselves 2000 sheep   was taken by the Indians from the Mexican Heard going to Calafornia Elder Hyde  looked well & some banged with his Journey.

My Son Wilford Woodruff Jr  commenced to learn the shoe Makers trade with Brother Barston the first of this   Month      The following Dream was related by H. C. Kimball Nov 25 1856      Nov 25 I dreamed that I was travelling with a companion & we came  to a powerful rapid stream of water like the Niagara River, the waves were   rolling vary high & increasing in size the waters had been muddy but were  getting Clear, as we came to this powerful stream we did not know how  we should get over it. I turned my Eyes a few moments from my companion  & when I look back I saw him on the other side of the river & climing a  steep hill I did not know how he got there I wanted to cross so I called to   him as loud as I could to stop & wait for me but He paid no attention to me   but went on as Hard as He could then a person came to me & said you  have an iron rod in your hand which I percieve I had several feet long  the Angel said to me you must use this rod & feel your way over the river & I awoke     
 I considered my dream & interpeted it as follows my Companion was J. M. Grant He has   suddenly died & left me & is [on] the other side of the veil the waters mean the people that  are increasing in streng[th]s & growing better & clearer, the Iron rod is the word   of God which I must cling to till I get through death.

 WILFORD WOODRUFF'S  JOURNAL  for   1857

I refered to the Blessings of presidents Youngs family   soon Presidents Young came in & addressed the people for half an   hour or more the following is a synopsis of his remarks     
 [FIGURES] A synopsis of President B Youngs remarks Before the 18 ward Jan 11th 1857  the following is not recorded or reported in any other place       It is wright that we should meet together often to pray sing preach   teach & recieve instruction in order to assist us to live our religion, but   none of thes things or any of the ordinances of the gospel which we admin-  ister to the children of men or to each other does not benefit the Lord   Our worshiping the Lord is of no particular benefit to our Father in Heaven   but it is all entirely for our own benefit & in this light we should   view it. their is a doctrin taught from the stand & freequently taught   in Public that we should follow Brother Joseph or Brother Brigham  or any man who leads & do as they say & obey them & that is all that is   required but this is a fals doctrin in one sense. for I will say that   no man should trust to the testimony of another but he should go to God   & get the testimony for himself this evry man & woman should do   I might have heard Joseph Smith preache & testify of the truth of the Book   of mormon & of this work untill he had been as old as Methuselah & in   the end I should have snaped my fingers at him & said to him you   are a foolish old man & turned upon my heels & walked off if I   had not have had some other testimony besides his but I went to   the Lord & the Lord revealed to me that it was true & that it was his word   & I received it upon that principle, & I have lived upon that   principle from that day untill now & it is the right privilege & Duty   of evry man & woman to get the revelation of Jesus Christ for   themselves & evry person should get the spirit of God & live by   it & if all would do this there would not be a man or woman unhappy   in this territory & the flood of complaint which now salutes my   ears of Husbands & wives complaining of each other would be done   away. One man comes & sayes my family will not be subject to   me another woman says my husband abuses me & I want a bill   to get away from him and a thousand complaints come poreing in   upon me none of which I should hear if the people lived by the   spirit of God you should all obtain the spirit of God & overcome   your passions when you get angry you should put a peace of   Indiaruber in your mouth & bite it untill you could get perfect   controll over your passion do not speak while you are angry for   you will say sumthing that you will be sorry for but if you will keep   your thoughts to yourself when you are angry they will not become   the property of another. Any person who is acquainted with me knows   that I have controll over myself I do not speak in anger to my   wives, children or the people. I make all my Passions be in subjection  to the priesthood & the spirit of God. people cannot fulfill their   calling & do their duty unless they are filled with the Holy Ghost  I do not know that there is a female in Israel who is worthy of the   appellation of a Mother in Israel for any woman to raise up children   unto the Lord as they should do they should be filled with the Holy Ghost   when they concieve seed & continue filled with the Holy Ghost   untill the child is born & weaned then the Mother should have the Holy   Ghost to teach the child untill He is Grown up so the Father should   be filled with the Holy Ghost when he begetts a child & he also should   be filled with the Holy Ghost in order to train up that child right then   it will be Holy unto the Lord & will have power with God. these are   true principles. the saints should bring all there passions in subjections   to the Law of God I am learning evry day I live, I see some that   will bear a testimony that they know that Joseph was a prophet     
 & the Book of Mormon is true & this work is of God & yet if any thing is said   that comes contrary to their selfish dispositions they will manifest the   most stoubern will & will not yield one hair from what their wicked   dispositions dictate. I see it in families one will growl because one  drops a mop at their door or does sumthing that does not please them   they have no disposition to do any thing ownly for their own Gratification   but this is not right you should feel like this what can I do to help   you I am not above helping my neighbor, do you want your shoes blacked  I will black them I am not to good to do it this is the way you should   feel for the Lord will reward you according to your work. their are   many in this Territory who are miserable why because they have not the   spirit of God they do wrong & get into the dark but no person should be   miserable who has received the Holy Gospel they should be happy all the time   day & night many other remarks was made which iare not now brought   to my mind      January 12, 1857 ~ Monday      12th I spent the day in the Legislature & attended meeting with the seventies   O Hyde W. Woodruff & L. Snow of the Twelve spoke & Joseph Young who   has been sick a long time came out a long ti for the first time &   spoke to the people we were all glad to see him the spirit of the Lord was   with us & we had a good meeting      January 13, 1857 ~ Tuesday      13th I spent the day in the Legislature & in the evening I met with   with the missionaries in the Historians office we heard the report   of the missionaries & the subject of the spirits was brought up &   discused they have begun to visit the Houses in the 16th ward as  the spirit rapping while we were in Meeting there was a visita  tion to Mr Jarvis House by some persons who broke the windows in   & broke furniture & set fire to the House but his wife put it out      January 14, 1857 ~ Wednesday      14 I spent the day in the office & Legislature in the evening   Preston Thomas & S M Blair came in & spent a part of the evening   the remainder of my time I spent at home with my family      January 15, 1857 ~ Thursday      15 I spent the day in the Legislature it was a snowy day I attend  ed the 14th ward meeting several spoke F D.

I shovelled off the snow from my houses      January 17, 1857 ~ Saturday      17th snow is about 3 feet deep on a level this morning it is cold   I spent the evening at home      January 18, 1857 ~ Sunday      18th Sunday I started some messengers for Rush valley to see about our  cattle as they are dying in most parts of the valley & Territory.

 He did not approbate the procedings at the close I went to the 17th ward   & preached to the people Brother Cummings spoke before me & Brother Wright   & I followed them we had the spirit of God & my mind was open & I   enjoyed the meeting well. I told the people to seek for happiness by doing   the works of wrighteousness & not seek for happiness by doing evil   for that was contrary to the principle of Salvation as taught by the   Lord our God. I exhorted them to live their religion      January 19, 1857 ~ Monday      19th [FIGURE] I wrote a Letter of recommend for John Eninion to Loren Farr  & Thomas Kington & spent the day in the Historians office      January 20, 1857 ~ Tuesday      20th I settelled my tithing to day with Bishop Hoagland &   Paid for the past year $97.44 cts + 12.00 = $109.44 Besides my per Diem $12   not recor[d]ed in account but will come in in the [April]  year in 1857 their is still a balance due me on settlement   of the tithing Books of $25.17 cts.

I attended the prayer Circle   in the evening when I arived there I saw a large company of men   & women coming out of the Presidents office. He had been sealing men   & women from the close of the meeting up to that time & had to turn away   many which he could not attend to       I Preached in the evening at the 2nd ward school house A Cordon   spoke also Brother Tune & Bishop Hill. I then spoke about one hour   & had the spirit of God upon me & the people with myself were edifyed      February 2, 1857 ~ Monday      2nd I spent the day in the office writing letters I attended the   seventies meeting & had a good time the spirit of the Lord was  with us the meeting was addressed by Elders Rockwood & Hancock a short   time then followed by Elder Lorenzo Snow & W. Woodruff. Elder Snows   mind run in a vary interesting channel the spiritual atmosphere seemed   to be heavy when he ^a^rose but the spirit of God came upon him & he   spoke in a vary edefying & interesting manner the following remarks wer  Elder snow was written from memery      Brethren I rise to occupy a short time I realize that there is a feeling   with nearly all of this people that there is sumthing of great importance   awateing this people some think that we will be beset by a great mob   from the states others that we would have an insurrection in our mids[t]   & others sumthing Els now of [if] the people really knew that we would be met   by a mob & that our lives depended upon our being well armed you would  see this people sell their coat or shirt to buy revolvers & weapons so   as to defend their wives children & their own lives but I am satisfyed   that there are scenes awaiting this people that will require all the grace &   wisdom which we can muster to pass through in safety. now for instance   this people are makeing a great rush to President Youngs office to get wives   sealed to them on sunday night President Young sealed men & women   till it was time for the prayer circle to meet then He had to turn a room  full out of Doors to wait another time this spirit is increasing throughout   this Territory now do those who are taking so many wives realize that   it will want a great Deal more power with God the Holy Ghost & wisdom  to preside over that Houshold than it does to go to the nations & preach  the gospel, build up Churches & organize them & preside over & controll   them, if they do not realize it it is true, now here is this great body   of seventies & every other Quorum of this church should labour hard   to arm yourselves with all the power of God you can get in order to save   your families if you do not if you do not you will soon find a   stamped[e] with your wives you cannot hold them they will break   from you you I need the wisdom of the Gods to rest upon you to save   your families for if you do not have great wisdom you will   meet with trouble. you have many wives & children this woman     
 wants a gown that one a Bonnet the next one shoes & their children   clothing & one thinks she Has to do more than her part & this one will   not do what she should &c & the man has got to stand in the midst   of his family like a God in order to calm the troubled waters & safe   them. A man may Go to a ward meeting & preach & the power of God   is upon him he comes home he finds one woman scolding & freting   another one in tearess, another one complaining & the children   fighting & by the time he gets well in the midst of it hith faith   courage & patience almost fails him, & he has to rise up in the majesty   of a God as it were & have Great wisdom faith & patience & exercise   much Generalship & show himself a master spirit & a savior & a   Fatherly care & kind ness in order to save his wives & children. Here   is a mission for you ye Elders of Israel. Look for instance at the example   of president Young go into his house & take lessons see him with his   great family of wives & children & se the God like character & exam-  ple of that man & the order which he manifests in his family I   tell you if it was not so you would see a stampede suddenly in that   House but He is a great master spirit & manifests great wisdom   in the perfect order of Government with his numerous family of   wives & children, they all respect him & obey his law for the wisdom   of God is with him. Now brethren strive to bring yourselves to the same   standard become a patriarch over your own Household & seek to   save them connected with order you have to become a financere   & you have to support your wives & children & you want to live   so that you can call upon God to increase your flock heards &   crops this brethren is the greater work which you have to prepare   your minds for almost any fool can go & preach the gospel but   it requires a vary wise man to be a patriarch & save his own   household. Many other interesting remarks were made which I   have not room here to record      W Woodruff followed & said I have been much instructed with the word   of Elder Snow his words are true as the gospel & I bear testimony of its truth   I am watching the spirits of men we come & meet with the seventies and   with all other Quorums of the church from the 12 down & watch the spirits &   give instruction as the spirit dictates this is not ownly our right &but duty   Here is before me a vast body of 70sseventies the minds of this body of men   must be fed your presidents should be filled with the spirit & power of God   so that they can attend all the meetings & feed them & give unto them the   mind & will of God if they do not do this they will die & cannot stand   for the minds of these seventies must be fed but many of them who   have been ordained into these Quorms have not prized the prieshhood   which they have had sealed upon them many times they have been so   anxious to go & attend to some trifling thing that they could not stop   long enough to be ordained at least as soon as the hands were off   they would run & not stop to give their genealogy many of the Elders   of this Church have trifled with the priesthood. there is now a   call made to gather up all the Elders priests Teachers & Deacons that are   ^not^ esspecially ingaged as teachers with the Bishops to come forward & be   ordained into the seventies now it does appear to me that the Lesser   priesthood is necessary in the church otherwise the Lord would not have   esstablished it. the Headd cannot say to the feet we have no need of you   no more than the feet can say to the head we have no need of you. almost   all the Lesser priesthood are striveing to become ordained into the seventies   while the bishops wish them to officiate in the Lesser priesthood. * see the star on the other page     
 February 3, 1857  ~ Tuesday      3rd I spent the day in the office writing Letters to correspondence &c I   attended the Bishops meeting in the evening at the seventies Hall we had a   good meeting Bishop Hunter spoke followed by Lorenzo Snow who preached   nearly the same sermon that he did last night to the 70s meeting I   followed him & bore testimony to the truth of what he had said I   was followed by Bishops Hardy & Little      February 4, 1857 ~ Wednesday      4th [FIGURES] I finished my Letters to my correspondence I   I wrote 6 Letters to the Mormon, Standard, Star, G. A. Smith J M.   Bernhisel & Lyman & Rich the Calafornia Mail arived at abut   2 oclok it brought the standard Mormon & some Letters not much   news it also brought the star. I spent the evening at the office with   with L Snow & F. D. Richards in conversation & had a plesant   interview together. [FIGURE] I received two papers of pear & Apple pie mellon seeds   from C C Rich      February 5, 1857 ~ Thursday      5th A snowey day. I spent a part of the day writing & reading I attended   a trial before the High Counsel & 13 ward of Brother Capaner that was   cut off from the Church after Hearing the testimony of both parties &   remarks from the councellors & decision of president Spenser, then   President Young delivered an address to the people a synopsis of   which was taken by Brother Bolton delivered to me & filed in the   Historians office. He said a Bishop & his councillors might cut   off a man from the church whether any of the ward voted or not   He said should the people follow a Bishop yes if he is a righteous   man & does right but if he teaches wrong things & does wrong the   people should not follow Him but when this is the case let the people   thunder out the truth as it is then the bishop will see it but  unless the people can point out some better way let them follow  the bishop. see Boltons report      * (From the back page) The Bishops feel to complain & say the seventies   take all of the Lesser priesthood which we have & ordain them seventies   so by the time we get some teachers organized they are ordained to   the office of seventies. The seventies also complain that the Bishops   come & take away their presiding officers & the seventies & make   bishops & councellors of them & ordain them High priest so their   appears to be a difference of feeling in the several Quorums in   order to avoid this I would recommend that the Teachers Priest &   Deacons all that the Bishops wish to make use of as teachers in the  several Quorum remain as they are untill they have magnifyed their   calling & not evry man as soon as he is ordained a teacher go & get   ordained a seventy & hide himself in that mighty forest of men   so that He cannot be found For the seventies are like a forest   trees of all kinds from the tallest down to the shrubery & men   get lost in such a forest men should not despise the lesser priest-  hood for it is honorable & if they fully magnify that office they   will have great power & many blessings for the Aaronic priesthood   hold the keys of administering of Angels & their has been but few  men even High Priest or Apostles that have enjoyed all the blessings   that belongs to the Lesser priesthood. Then Let not the seventies seek   to get all the Lesser priesthoods ordained into ther quorums if they   do I do not wish them to complain if seventies are taken out   to Make Bishops councillors & teachers of them as long as nearly   all the timber is in that body. Let a man have what portion   of the priesthood He may He wants to keep it in lively exercise in   order to save himself & family *)

Brother   George Sims spoke in the morning, gave quite a musical Physioliogical   discourse. He was followinged by Aropene the Utah Chief he delivered   a powerful discourse & exhorted the saints in the strongest manner to   follow their leaders & do right not drink whiskey or do wrong in any thing  I followed him & told the people to lay that exertation to heart as it was  given by a Lamanite chief I spoke at length which was reported  by J.

 February 17, 1857 ~ Tuesday      17th [FIGURE] In company with F. ^D.^ Richards I called upon President Young  and asked him what I should do whare council was asked   of me either by the 70s or Bishops. Joseph Young said to the Quorum  of seventies that when they were called to be Bishops or councillors  that they might still retain their place as Presidents of the seventies &   not be ordained High Priests. Bishop Hunter thinks that they should Be ordained  Bishops & High Priest. what shall I do about it. President Young said if   they would go their ^way^ & hold there tongue about it they might stand as they   are & act as Councellors to a Bishop, but if they will not, ordain them  I said I thought that men ought to walk in the channel pointed out  for them & not complain about it President Young said yes let them  do as they are told. I spent the day in the office reading History & councelling  Elder L Snow & F. D. Richards was with me a part of the day. I attended the   Bishops meetings in the eveing. Bishop Hunter spoke & I followed him  I told the Bishops to impress upon the minds of the people the necessity  of living their Religion after this date for if the people again commit   sin after being forgiven as they now were they would not  again be forgiven but the Justice of the Law would be brought against   them & they would have to pay the penalty or be cut off from the   Church again I told them they should not boast of their authority   & power or that a seventy was greater than a High Priest or that a   High Priest was greater than a seventy no man should boast of the  power of the priesthood untill he obtained some of that power &  it was manifested upon him & when that was upon him he certainly   would not boast of it for the Holy spirit would teach him sens enough   to know better. It is vary seldom that I have known the power of   the presiesthood made manifest upon the Children of men in our [day] to a  vary great Degree but in some instances it was manifest as in  the case of the prophet Joseph at the time his [house] was full of the sick &  dying & his door Yard & they were strewed along the bank of the River   for 2 miles & Joseph Rose up & shook himself like an old Lyion  & commenced at his own tent door & healed all the people who was  not dead on both sides of the river by the power of God his voice was   as the voice of God & the earth almost trembled under his feet as he com-  manded the sick to arise & be made whole. It was also manifest with   Joseph while made fast in chains & in prision in Missouri & his wicked  ungodly persecuters gathered around him & while he was made fast in  chains with his chains Brethren yet they goaded his feelings by boasting   of how many murders they had commited & rapes upon mormon women   & how they had cut the mormons to peices then they would blaspheme the  name of God untill his spirit was reigned up & he rose up in the power of  God in the midst of his chains & spoke as in the voice of thunder "Silence   ye fiends of the pit. I will not live another momen[t] & hear such vile   language from mortals, either you or I shall die right here or els you  shall scease from boasting of shall such damnable deeds as you are guilty  of."  They quailed before his words like leather wilting in the flames  & they bowed before him & made acknowledgements to him this was done  by the power of God. "Again David Patten was taken by an armed mob  under a United States warrant & when he was surrounded with an armed  mob of about 40 men under the garb of Law & would not let him say one word in  his own defence but he arose in the power of God & held them fast to their seats   untill he addressed them about 1/2 an hour he told them they were cowards   rascals & villans & he proved it to them, & they had not power to harm a hair   of His head & they let him & Warren Parrish go, away. Again this power  was manifest with President Brigham Young on the bank of the Missouri River  at Winter Quarters when the merchants brought up goods to sell to the brethren     
 who were going to the mountains. Old Major Miller the Indian Agent was   surrounded by officers & Miller in order to show his great power He told the  merchants that owned some Alcohol not to roll a Barrel of [liquor] off from the  boat that He would knock the head in & spill it upon the ground president   Young steped up & told the men to roll it out & if miller spilled it that  moment I will spill his clarret He & all the office[r]s turned pale the liquor   was rolled out & nobody hurt. And other instances might be named when   the power of the priesthood has been manifest but these men have never   boasted of it nor never will I made many other remarks. I was followed   by Lorenzo Snow who spoke well.      February 18, 1857 ~ Wednesday      18th I spent the day in the office reading history. Elders L Snow F. D. Richards  & E. Hunter was in the office & conversed upon many things. I copy the following  report from the presidency a month since. He said that is (President Young) that He  wished the Brethren at Carson valley would come home. President Kimball   said that I dont want to see the Presidents of the seventies in the stand untill they  get more of the spirit of God for they are dead & the seventies have to receive   their food through them. Brother Young said I do not wish to have Father  Morley not to seal any more men & women without my consent  I was troubled with the teeth ake. I took an instrumen & dug a stump   of a tooth out of my Jaw that was broke off level at the Gum it was   a tedious operation. I spent the evening at the office reading history      February 19, 1857 ~ Thursday      19th I spent the fore part of the day in the office. I started at 3 oclok   with Brother Smoot & our families for the sugar house ward I preached  to the people was followed by Bishop Smoot we had a good meeting.

I then walked to Brother Ira Eldridges  with Brother Smoot.

The Journal & travels of Benjamin F Cummings to  Bitter Root valley was read which was interesting. President Young said  I would abandon the road that we have contemplated taking & cross at the south  pass or wind River Chain we will find a good pass there. the price of freight  will come down when settelments are made in that Land. there is a     
 good place there to make a settelment of the saints I can tell you that we intend  to fill many places yet if they will let us alone. Brother Cummings  says that the mountains are much higher than here that shows that the vallies   are lower than here. Those places are filled with streams & the streams   with fish & the fish with Eggs.      The subject of Claytons printing some revel-  ation & keys came up President Young said that He thought He should   put a stop to people printing matter without his knowledge at their press  I attended the 14th ward meetings, the House was full.

He is watching   this people & he is watching us as leaders & teachers & he knows almost every  thing which is going on throughout the Church & kingdom of God & if he  sees us doing the same things which he would do & teaching the same doctrin  He is pleased with us & seese that we are in the right path. It is so with me   to night the vary things which were resting upon my mind since I   have been sitting here have been preached by Broterh Cummings & Brother  Richards this is a Joy to me for it shows that it is the spirit of truth   & that it reveals the same things to us all      February 25, 1857 ~ Wednesday      25 I called at the office in the morning & wrote in my Journal & spent most   of the day in the office correcting minutes & Journal writing.

O Hyde Preached   in the morning upon the text "strait is the gate & narrow the way that  leadeth unto Eternal life & few there be that find it &c" He was followed  by President Young who preached one of the most comforting & inter-  esting discourses ever delivered to the people if we past our inspection   [FIGURE] before Joseph we probably should Peter & Jesus then we should be  quite safe. if all this people did not go to a celestial kingdom it would   be their own fault, but will all have the same exaltation & glory in  the Celestial Kingdom by no means there will be but few that go there   that will be crowned kings & Priests & Gods there will be many millions   in the Celestial Kingdom that will not be exhalted to those hier blessings  this People are a good people & they are advanceing faster than any   other people that ever lived it would not be 120 years insted of 365 before  this people would with the portion of Earth which they occupy be separated from  the wicked. the Lord will bless this people if you will do as well as you  know how all will be well with you many glorious remarks were  made by President Young all of which were reported by G. D. Watt  I attended the prayer meeting in the evening. President Young had O Pratts  pamphlet read called the Holy Spirit & he made the following remarks  after hearing it read He said that Brother Pratt had got beyong [beyond] the   stars He had Carrelled them & got beyond them      [FIGURE] President Young asked Wm W Phelps by what authority he had  proclaimed in Public that He (Brigham Young) was the man that   the Lord said he would raise up like unto Moses "Phelps said Joseph  was gone & you are left to lead the People. B.Y. that is no Argument   at all I may die & others be left that does not prove that I or they  would be the one refered to. If I thought I was the man I would not   tel of it. But I think I am the great man that none of the prophets   ever thought of or spoke of.      Orson Hyde said there was a man in Provo professed to have a visit  from a Departed spirit he comes to him dressed in his temple  Rob[e]s & the man he comes to has not had his endowments and  I want to know what you think of it I thought the whole of it  smelt strongly of Brimstone      President Young said now if the people in Provo can be made to  believe that that is a true visit about the third time he comes He  will say that this Church is not led by the man that ought to lead   it but the man that has thos visits will tell you that he is to lead the  Church. Now I will tell you how you may know it is fals a spirit   will not come to a man in the flesh without he appears in his glory  & men cannot endure his glory a resurrected body may come   & hide his glory. but that visitation is false it is not true      I went to the 14th ward school House to meeting O Hyde & many   others were there as missionaries several spoke I followed with  few remarks & was followed by O Hyde      March 9, 1857 ~ Monday      9th I spent the day in the office mostly I set out some trees &   grape vines      March 10, 1857 ~ Tuesday      10th I set out currant Bushes & grape vines I spent a part of   the day in the office I attended the missionary meeting in the evening   & had a good time I spoke a short time at the close of the meeting     
 March 11, 1857 ~ Wednesday      11th I spent the fore part of the day setting out vines & currants  the after noon in the office      March 12, 1857 ~ Thursday      12th I set out 5 Almonds & 25 peach trees one Apricott & one   plum in my Garden this fore noon I spent the afternoon in the office      March 13, 1857 ~ Friday      13 I spent the day in the office      March 14, 1857 ~ Saturday      134th I spent the fore part of the day Grafting Apples & pears the   afternoon I spent in the office. President Young called in & Herd   History read nearly all the afternoon He heard a part of his   own history read, & a part of the continuation of the History of the   the Death of Joseph. I attended a feast at A. O. Smoots Bishop   Hunter J. C. Little & J Horn was present with their wives      March 15, 1857 ~ Sunday      15 Sunday I spent the day at the Tabernacle. G. D. Grant Preached   followed by J. D. T. MCallister then by Brother Kimball who   spoke at length. In the afternoon President Young spoke a vary   interesting sermon from the following text "who is my Father Mother   Brothers & sisters they are those who do the will of my father which   is in heaven." [##Matthew 12:50##] I attended the prayer Circle. President Young   said he had the following dream. I thought we had a great   crop of wheat the whole Earth was filled with it all around the   Heads were very long & there was so much of it the people   did not seem to care any thing about it, did not try to save   it I had to continually urge the people to save the wheat they   said they had more than they wanted for this year I told them   to go to & save all the wheat they had then next year they could   work on the Temple."      President said that the King Philip corn was nothing more than the   Jumbo Corn some man plants an acre & takes great care of it &   he gets a great crop of it, the way they got corn so early they   will take the ear that sets first & pull the silk out of all the rest   then plant the but part of that Ear & that will make early corn   now that is the way with the best breed of cattle, they keep picking   out the best for stock, & that increases the goodness of them. Owen   wanted his society to adopt this plan to take all the noble men   & women & raise up a society when they had a dwarf send him   away      President Young said to Elder O Hyde you have been to both   Jerrusalem & Zion & seen both I have not seen either for I   never have been in Jackson county now it is a plesant thing   to think of to know whare the old garden of Eden is did   you ever think of it, or sens it, I do not think many do, now   Jackson County is the Garden of Eden, Joseph has declaired this   & I am as much bound to believe it as much as I am to believe  Joseph is a prophet of God, many in Jackson county have found out   that they cannot cultivate the Temple Block & other places in that   county we must let the Lord take his own time to prepare the way   for our return to that county & to build up that Temple      16 I spentI went to the 15 ward & preached during the evening to the people      March 16, 1857 ~ Monday      16th I spent the day in the office writing I attended the meeting   of the seventies in the evening. Brother Joseph Young spoke to the people  in a vary edefying manner exhorted them to get the spirit of God     
 & Edify the people He was followed by W. Woodruff I told them that I felt   like bearing testimony to what brother Joseph had said his teachings   were Just & true. You cannot edify this people without you speak by   the Holy Ghost a man may have all the Eloquence of a Cicero or   the knowledge of the world combined & he cannot feed the immortal   mind of a Latter Day saint unless he speaks by the spirit of God. He may  talk of visions & revelations or any thing Els unless he has the spirit   of God He will not edefy this people look at the teaching of the prophet   Joseph all other men might preach though many might preach by the   spirit of the Lord & Edify the people yet if the people knew that Joseph   was going to preach the people would poor out of their houses like bees  out of a Hive. So with President Young at this day if the people knew   that He was going to preach they would fill the Tabernacle an hour before   the time of meeting. his words are plain & easy but they are filled   with the spirit & power of God unto Edification      I was followed by F. D. Richards who spoke well unto Edifycation      March 17, 1857 ~ Tuesday      17th I spent the day in the office on the History of the Twelve &   found great difficulty in obtaining any thing for the History of   those who had apostitized. I attended the meeting of the Bishops   Bishop Hunter spoke & said he wished the clerk to keep a strict   Account of their meetings as it would make a good History He   councilled the Bishops to finish the canal & do all that is required of   them. Joseph Young spoke said that was the first time that He ever   attended a Bishops meeting in his life He spoke vary well I followed   him [FIGURE] The following is a Brief synopsis of my remarks I said I felt   to say a few words we have had a good exertation from Brother Joseph   Young He said some had thought that we should have the privilege of   coming to thes vallies & setting down & resting but he thought that we had   as much to do as ever I think so to I am thoroughly converted to   the faith that we shall never arive at that period of existance when   we shall not have sumthing to do I believe our work will increase   throughout all Eternity though we may not have to gain our bread   by the sweat of our brow neither shall we always have to cultivate   the soil in the midst of thornes & briers. Our Father in Heaven is   always busy his kingdom & works are increaseing & I believe it   will be the same with us throughout all Eternity if we are saved. There   is another subject which I wish to speak of. Brother Hunter said that   He wanted the clerk to keep a record of their meetings as it would   make a good History this is a subject I have always felt interested  in & as there are many branches in the kingdom of God so their should   be some persons engaged in each branch I have often spoken upon   this subject & I have often thought that to many it was dry and   uninteresting to many I mean the subject of Journal writing & keeping   a history of what transpires with us from day to day. I was deeply   impressed with the importance of this subject to day while reading the History   of the organization of the quorum of the Twelve and the remarks of the   Prophet Joseph upon the subject. He said -["I have for myself learned a fact   by experience which on reflection gives me much sorrow. It is a truth   that if I now had in my possession evry decission which has been given   upon important items of Doctrin & duties since the rise of this church   they would be of incalculable worth to the saints but we have neglected   to keep a record of such things thinking perhaps that they never   benefit us afterwords which had we now would decide almost     
 any point that might be agitated and now we cannot bear record   to the Church nor unto the world of the great & glorious manifestation   that have been made to us with that degree of power and authority   which we otherwise could if we had those decissions to publish abroad   [FIGURE] Since the Twelve are now chosen I wish to tell them a course  which they may persue & be benefited here after in a point of light   of which they perhaps are not now aware. At all times when   you assemble in the capacity of a council to transact business let the   oldest of your Number preside & let one or more be appointed to keep   a record of your procedings & on the decission of evry important   item let it be what it may let such decission be noted down and   they will ever after words remain upon record as LAW covenants   & doctrin. Questions thus deci[d]ed might at the time appear unimportant   but should they be recorded & one of you lay hands upon them after   words you might find them of infinate worth not ownly to your   brethren but a feast also to your own souls"       "Should you assemble from time to time & procede to discuss import-  ant (subjects) or questions & pass decissions by & by upon them &   omit to record such decisions by & by you will be driven to straits   from which you will not be able to extricate yourselves & not being   in a situation to bring your faith to bear with sufficient perfection   or power to obtain the desired information. Now in consequence of   a neglect to write these things when God revealed them not essteeming   them of sufficient worth the spirit may withdraw & God may be angry   and here is a fountain of intelligence or knowledge of infinate   importance which is lost. what was the cause of this the answer   is slothfulness or Neglect to appoint a man to occupy a few moments   in writing" "[FIGURE] Here Let me prophesy the time will come when if   you neglect to do this you will fall by the Hands of unrighteous men   were you to be brought before the authorities and accused of any crime   or misdemienor and be as innocent as the angels of God unless you can   prove that you were some whare els your Enemies will prevail against   you but if you can bring Twelve men to testify that you were in some   other place at that time you will escape there hands now if you   will be careful to keep minutes of these things as I have said it   will be one of the most important & interesting records ever seen  I have now laid these things before you [for] your consideration and you   are left to act according to your own Judgment"]- (See record of the   Twelve Historians office) ^and History of the Church February 1835^ I have thus refered to sume of the words of   Joseph to the Twelve Apostles at their organization. This shows the   feelings of the Prophet Joseph upon this subject I have had this   same subject upon my mind ever since I have been a member   of the church I have been inspired & moved upon to keep a Journal   & write the affairs of this church as far as I can I did not understand   why my feelings was exercised so much in the early age of this church   but I understand it now I seldom ever heard Brother Joseph or the   Twelve preach or teach any principle but what I felt as uneasy as   a fish out of water untill I had written it then I felt right I   could write a sermon of Josephs a week after it was delivered almost   word for word & after it was written it was taken from me or from   my mind this was a gift from God unto me and I have kept a   Journal of almost evry day of my life for the last 24 years I could   tell each day what I had done, what company I was in & what   was transpiring around me and any teachings or councils from the   presidency of the Church except whare I knew that reporters had     
 written there discourses & I have urged this same course upon the Twelve   & all the corums of the Church to keep a record of there meetings & the   dealings of God with them & for all men who bear the Priesthood   to keep a record of their lives esspecially of all their official acts in   the church & kingdom of God. You may say that this is a great deal   of trouble vary well it has been to me in one sens it has occupied   nearly evry leasure moment of my time for 24 years but what of it   I have never spent any of my time more profitably for the benefit of   manking [mankind] than in my Journal writing for a great portion of the Church   History has been compiled from my Journals & some of the most glorious  Gospel sermons truths & revelations that were given from God to this people   through the mouth of the Prophets Joseph, Brigham, Heber & the Twelve could   not be found upon the Earth on record ownly in my Journals & they are   compiled in the Church History & transmitted to the saints of God in   all future Generations does not this pay me for my trouble it does in   many instances in this Church men have been appointed clerks   to write for the church they have kept the records instead of   delivering them to the President of the Church whare they belonged & some   they would appostitize then they would insult the Church by offer-  ing to sell them their own records at an enormous price. I have   deposited my records & Journals in the Historians office whare I   hope they may do some good. we have had a vary interesting  time this winter during the referamation among the Latter day saints   the spirit & power of God has been poured out in a wonderful   manner & many glorious truths have been revealed through   the presidency Twelve & others & in the various quorums meeting   now should not their be a record kept of these things in the comm-  encement of these meeting the clerks took quite full reports   but thinking it to much trouble they now take them vary short &   we can hardly get an outline of the real facts of our meetings   & the power of God & the dealings of God with us evry man should   write a brief history of his life his parentage, His birth his   religion when he was baptized & by whom when ordained what   to & by [w]home give a brief sketch of all his missions & of all his   offical acts & the dealings of God with him then if He was to   die & the Historians wished to publish his history they would   have sumthing to go by. Many may think this a dry subjet   & unimportant but it is not so to me I am now trying to   get up a history of the Twelve Apostles as first organized   half of them are now out of the Church & scarsly any record   left whareby I can get a correct knowledge of their ministry   or work & some of those who remain & are labouring to   build up the kingdom of God have not kept a record of   their missions ministry offical acts & decission upon important   subjects & the gifts graces & dealings of God with them sufficient to   give a true & corret History of their lives their are but   few aside from the presidency of this church who feel the import-  ance of this subjet sufficent to put it in practice. It may be   considered by some not important to write or keep a record of our   work or the work of God but I believe it is otherwise the Prophets   would not have been moved upon to exhort us to faithfulness upon   this subject the Lord has told us that what we seal on Earth shall   be sealed in heaven & what we record on Earth shall be recorded   in heaven & what is not sealed or recorded on Earth is not sealed     
 or recorded in heaven therefore it appears to be vary important   that we do keep a true & faithful record in all things. while walking   in a rapid stream we cannot tread twice in the same water neither   can we spend twice the same time when we pass out of that   door the work of this meeting will be closed to us forever we shall   never spend the time of this evening again then should we not keep   a record of our work teachings & council which we give in this   meeting we should. again Elders go forth upon missions to the   Nations of the Earth the[y] have to Enter into a regular warfare the   Lord pours out his Holy Spirit upon them & they war with the world   the flesh, & the Devil, with kings, princes, Lords, Presidents & rulers   He is cast into prision the Lord delivers him. The Devil enters into   some of his converts & He lays hands upon them & he cast them out,   the saints are sick & he heals them, He prophesies in the name of   the Lord & his words come to pass. Rulers declair that He shall not   preach to the people on pain of death. He preaches the word of God &   many believe obey & rejoice in the Lord & he is protected by the   power of God. He goes upon the Sea the storms rage & he calms  the water & wind in the name of the Lord. He is shielded & guarded   by angels of God all the day long & he knows the power of God  is with him & reveals unto him all the evils that lie in his path   And yet he does not view thise great & important things of   value enough to make a record of them to spend a short time in  writing them & the circumstances & history of those blessings   unto him are lost both to the present & all future generation. are   these things wright I do not believe they are. I do not believe a man   is Justified in neglecting to record these things.       Now as an example should the Ten lost tribes of Israel suddenly   come pouring down upon us in the Land of Zion Led by the Holy prophets   of God what would be one of the first inquiries we should make   of them it would be whare are your records & history & the   revelations & dealings of God with you since you were lead away   under Shalmanezar king of Asyria? O do let me see them &   read them & do let me [read] the Journal of your travels from the   North country to Our land of Zion & what would be our disappo-  intment should the prophets & Elders say O we have not got any   history of the dealings of God with us nor any Journal of our   travels we used to hear our Fathers say that there hath been   great & mighty things done in the Land whare we lived the savior   come & taught great & marvellous things & we had a glorious time   in coming here we smote the rocks & the mighty mountains of Ice   fell down with a great noise & great miriacles were wrought but  our Fathers had so much to do & we have had so much to do that we never   had any time to write any thing about it & we did not think that   any body would have any interest in it but ourselves & so we did   not write. would we not be awfully disappointed we should & so   with them should they ask for our records & say that Jesus & the Angels   had told th us that you was building up Zion & doing a great work   in the Earth & that great & glorious things were revealed unto you   & we now wish to read these things & should we tell them that we had   done as they had that we had not kept a record of any of these things   they would be like ourselves much disappointed, but if they & ourselves   should both keep a strict record of all that is useful then it would   add great Joy to both them & us. Then let us lay these things to heart   & keep a true & faithful record that we may be Justified befor God     
 March 18, 1857 ~ Wednesday      18th I spent the day in the office on History I spent the evening at home      March 19, 1857 ~ Thursday      19th I spent this day in the office on History I commenced the History of the   Twelve Apostles I find it difficult to get much history of some of the   first Twelve who have apostitize & left the Church      March 20, 1857 ~ Friday      20th I spent most of the day in the Office Journal writing & on History   of the Twelve Luke Johnson was with me in the evening      March 21, 1857 ~ Saturday      21st [FIGURE] I bought an Indian boy of Brother Willis this morning abot   6 years old.

I attended the prayer meeting   in the evening President Young said we have got to send men to the   Islands to liberate those who are there we would gather the saints from there   but the laws are against it. F. D. Richards said their was abot 60 saints in   Dresden President Young said the Lord would soon open the way for the gospel in  those Governments I would like to send some Elders to Siberia and also to the   Japanees Islands with Proper papers the Lord will soon open the way in the world   I attended the 16th ward meeting this evening & Preached to the people   the spirit of the Lord was with me & we had a good meeting & some to the      March 23, 1857 ~ Monday      23rd Monday I met at the 14th ward school House with the Bishop & members   of the ward & I dedicated the new Font for Baptizing the a Hymn was   was sung & I offered up the dedication Prayer & said, O God the   Eternal Father we bow before thee in the Name of Jesus Christ & by   virtue of the Holy Priesthood to dedicate & consecrate this ground &  Baptismal Font unto the Lord our God. we Pray for thy blessing O Lord   to rest upon us in this Holy Ordinance we dedicate this ground & this  Font & the water which it contains unto the name of the Lord and we  pray thee to Bless & sanctify this Ground & Font & may iet be Holy   before thee & the water which is in the Font & m[a]y thy power & Holy   spirit rest upon the Bishop of this ward & his councellors and upon  evry man who goeth down into this Faunt Font to baptize the children   of men may no unclean thing enter into this Font or any one come   into it to be baptized unworthyly & may they blessings rest upon all   men who shall administer in thy name in this Font & upon all who   shall be administerd unto by thy servants & we pray that the inhabit-  ants of this word shall lay aside all their sins & evils & may thy blessings   rest upon them we ask the[e] Holy Father to except of this dedication   & consecration at our hands which we offered unto thee in the   Name of thy Son Jesus Christ Amen      at the close of the prayer Elder Franklin D Richards went into   the Font & Baptized his Father Phineas Richards & abut 40 others   I went into the school House & assisted in confirming 14 Samuel   W Richards was mouth in the confermation of his Father the Elders   continued to Baptize & confirmed members of the 14th ward through   the day. I met in council with the Rush valley Herd company     
 and we decided to bring over all the Heard & deliver them to the   owners. I attended A councel with the Presidency & Twelve   & others on the case of Bishop Hoagland & his wife Agnes she brought   a complaint against him that He did not pay attention enough to   her & provide well enough for her after hearing the matter on   both sides President Young said now go & do right & let Bishop   Hoagland Baptise you the same as the rest of the ward. I do not wish  to say much about this case but I think many things that I do not   want to say their is many women that care more about their   wives Husband sleeping with them than they do about God or his   kingdom & if a man was to submit to such women he would   not be worth shucks in building up the kingdom of God I have got   some such woman & I visit them one a year or once in 3 years as   I please & they may go to heaven or Hell just as they please I   shall not turn away from the work of God for any woman if the   people will follow the council of the 14th ward Bishop they will be   led into the kingdom of God & so will Agness but she wants pillow   council instead of ward council well now if Agnes never hears   any more pillow council or private council take the council which   he gives to the whole ward & you will be saved men must attend   to the duties of the kingdom of God first before any other object   and Now Agnes go home & do right & Brother Hoagland go & Baptize   her if she wishes to be & so here the matter droped      I attended the council of Seventies at the 70s Hall Hosea Stout D   Candlin & D Willkie addressed the meeting was followed by W Woodruff   & F.

Smith sermons read we conversed upon  the subject of the present excitement in the states concerning mormonism  we then went into the Temple Block to see the form of the first water  table made of white sand stone I then went into the president office  & spent the evening Bishop Blackburn was present the subject came up  of some persons leaving Provo who had Apostitized some though[t] that   Bishop Blackburn & President Snow was to blame Brother Joseph Young  presented the thing to president Young. But when the circumstances  were told President Brigham Young sustained the Brethren who pres-  ided at Provo He said they had done [blank] The subjects of Eunuchs  came up & Joseph said that He would rath er die than to be  made a Eunuch Brigham said the day would come when  thousands would be made Eunuchs in order for them to be   saved in the kingdom of God. The subject of women &   Adulterry came up Joseph Asked if a woman & man who   were married could commit Adultery Brigham said that Joseph  said they could not yet He was satisfied they could do wrong Presi-  dent Young said we cannot KClens the Platter because the people  will not bear it. Joseph I am willing to have the people Clens the   platter if they can do it in righteousness & Judge righteous Judg-  ment. Brigham. This people never was half as well prepared   to execute righteousness as Now. I will tell you that when a man  is trying to do right & do some thing that is not exactly in order   I feel to sustain him & we all should. I wish there was some prophet  on Earth who could tell us just how much sin we must sustain before  we can chastize the people & correct their errors. The wicked may   go to the states & call for troops I dont think the people will get rich     
 to come after us they have got a long road to travel we have either  got to Join hands with sin & sinners or we have got to fight them  The subject of Adultery again came up Joseph said a man cannot  commit Adultery with his wife so says the revelation on the Patriarchs  marriage yet a man can do rong in having connexion with his  his wife at times Joseph Young aske said the Ancient Apostle said this  a man should not put away his wife fsave for the cause of fornication  if He did they would both commit Adultery. Brigham Young  said Joseph taught that when a womans affections was entirly  weaned from her husband that was Adultery in spiri her   Affections were Adulterated from his He also said that there  was No law in Heaven or on Earth that would compel a   woman to stay with a man either in time or Eternity this   I think is true (but I do not know) that if a man that is a High   priest takes a woman & she leaves him & goes to one of a lesser   office say the Lesser priesthood or member I think in the   resurrection that that High Priest can claim her "Joseph  what if she should not want to go with him I should not  want a woman under those circumstances. Brigham I will tell  you what you will find that all those evil traditions & affectio[ns]  or passions that Haunt the mind in this life will all be done   away in the resurrection you will find then that any man who  gets a glory & exaltation will be so beautiful that any woman would   be willing to have him if it was right & wharever it is right  for the woman to go there she will be willing to go for all those  evils will vanish to which we are subject in this life. I have  told the people the truth Just as it is but others will at times  get up & tell the people that they will get no heaven ^[FIGURE]^ ownly what  they make in this life and that it will be in the next world as   it is in this now they do not mean whaat they say they do not  explain themselves Hence the people will not understand what is  said to them. Joseph said I wish I knew what my limits   were. Brigham Your limits are endless & you have not got half  way to the end of it yet. Now hwhen I was an Elder I was as  willing to correct an Error in the Brethren as I am now. But   the people do not see it so. Now if you should be with the 12   or any body you would have a right to correct an Error as   well as with a member but you could not correct them  by cutting them off from the Church because they are over  you in the priesthood. many other remarks were made at the time      June 3, 1857 ~ Wednesday      3rd Brother Oliphant grafted some of my trees to day I spent  most of the day with him I bought a yoke of 4 year old yoked  of Durham Oxen deep red paid $125 for them of Hooper A Lyman   arived home this evening with the Calafornia mail      June 4, 1857 ~ Thursday      4th I looked over Accounts to day with J.

I think it  will be well to send some missionaries through the states and tell   the brethren to pick up their budgets & come to the valley and  go to England let the brethren do this that go with the Mail  The US are fools to come upon this people & so are those men   who are bringing great quantities of Goods unto us this season  if the United States send out troops to fight us this season we   shall whip them out then they will send out reinforcements  then we shall have the Lamanites with us & the more the United   states send out the wors off they will be for they will perish   with Famine.  I do not think any thing about guns or powder for   if the United States begin war with us I intend they shall furnish     
 with arms and aminition all we want if they do undertake is  the Lord will lead them or let them go into a snare and ther  folly will be manifest. G. A. Smith said if we defeat them  you may look for 100000 men.

Wells said   that orders had been sent North & south to watch for   the soldery & not let them come in but to destroy them the best  way they could let grain be cashed in the mountains so they  can get at it. President Young said that He thought it would   be best to secure the grain in the mountain it was said that  Vannetting had 500 lb of powder coming & that He would go out   with cattle to bring it in or would do as He was told yes say President  Young except a righteous course. President Young said I had   rather have a good powder horn & charger than any flask in  the world He considered it safer. There is a deep feeling pervading   our city about the soldiers coming in to destrowy us as a  people. I had an interview with President B. Young &   he gave me some important instructions with regard to   Historical Matters at 5 oclok I called upon Brother Carri  ngton and went into his peach orchard & eat a fine  rair ripe peach called Carringtons 1st Early it was a splen-  did Peach, and is well worth cultivating. I was notifyed   to give the 12 Apostles an invitation to meet at the Temple   block at 6 oclok to make a deposit of the works published by  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints and we met  at the Temple Block at half past 6 oclok the company present   was the Presidency Brigham Young Heber C Kimball   & Daniel H Wells of the Twelve Apostles Wilford Woodruff   John Taylor Erastus Snow & Franklin Richards The Architect   Truman O Angel Alonzo H Rolley, Benjamin F Mitchel   Johnathan Pugmire Jr Edward L Parry (Mason)

He then began clothed with the spirit &  power of God & the revelations of Jesus Christ He recounted   our persecutions & oppressions for the last 25 years & then took  up the unjust Course of the United States against us at the present  time then He told us & all the world what the will of God was   & what his intentions were He would no longer submit to their  Ungodly persecutions If General Harney came here with an   armey to destroy this people we would destroy him & his armey  they should not come into this territory or our cities to destroy  this people the United States had turned mob & were breaking   the Constitution of the United States & we would now have  to go forth & defend it & also the kingdom of God, & should   they undertake to send an army of 50000, or 100000 men next  year we will lay waste this whole Territory & flee into the mounta[ins]     
 Aug 16 1857  I will lay all my dwellings in Ashes. I will lay all my mills in ashes  I will cut down evry green tree & shrub in the vallies of these mountains  I will burn evry peace of timber wood & board in the vallies of the  mountains then do you not think that our canyons will be adapted  for the bones of our Enemies I think it will. O Israel can you   stand these things. The shout of Yes rent the air of the assembled   thousands. All you who are willing to follow me in these things  raise your hands towards heavens there was a sea of hands up  I have had to hold the Indians here for years from destroying   the emigrants I have had to give them many thousands of dollars  to keep them from killing the Gentile Emigration to Calafornia  the United States Government now ows me $50000 in my  Official Capacity & they will not pay me a dime but are sending  armies at great Expens to destroy me & this people. But I will   now inform them & all people that if they make war upon me  I shall not attempt to restrain them any more but I shall let   them do as they please. The United states do not know what   they are doing. & the Merchants in this place do not know who  they are they are selling the blood of this people for Gold. they  were not going to bring any goods to this place but now that  an army of 2500 men are coming here to destroy this people   they can bring a great amount of Goods let them take  Heed to their ways. If the United states sends an Armey &  a train of goods here I may get a part of the pay which they   owe me I now wish to say to all Gentiles send word to your friends   that they must stop crossing this continent to Calafornia  for the indians will kill them for the Emigrants have shot down   the indians with out any cause or provocation & if the United States   make war upon me I shall not attemp to restrain them any  longer I will give all people in this Territory that wish the   privilege to leave I want all to leave that are not willing to   follow me. If there is any of my family my wives that wish  to leave I will send my teams & carry them whareever they wish  to go if it is to Hell I will drive to the gate but will not let my  teams go into hell but they must turn around & come back  but those that wish can enter in. I want this people to go to   & save all their grain & prepare to cash it up in the mountains  but dont let your Neighbor know whare you put it. I want   you to prepare for a 7 years siege. many other remarks were   made all taken by the reporters the spirit of God rested upon us   him & upon the congregation and all the saints felt to say amen  to all President Young said.      I attended the prayer meeting at  the presidents House various remarks were made by Brother Kimball   & Wells.      I attended the ward meeting in the evening & spoke  to the people I bore testimony to what President Young said during   the day I told the people to be passive in the hands of the Lord & be   ready to carry out the council of the Presidency in all things  Brother Stewart returned from the states to day & reported about the Emigration      August 17, 1857 ~ Monday      ^17th^   I called at the presidents office a short [time] I spent the day in the office      August 18, 1857 ~ Tuesday      18 The presidency went to Farmington or some place North to  a water mellon Party I spent half a day in the office the rest  & of the time I was budding peach trees I put in 150 of Carringtons   1 & 2nd Early peach

He was followed by Br   Rogers who had been on a mission to the sandwich Ishands He   said but few words was followed By President Heber C   Kimball who was filled with the power of God spok quite   lengthy told the people to obey council & do right, go & glean all   the wheeat in the fields & save it their was 1000 bushels in this  County that could be gleaned, if the people will do as they are   told they shall never be driven from these vallies an Enemy   shall not come in these vallies for we will not let them   if we have to take to our tents at all we will not pitch them   again as a resting place untill we Pitch them in Jackson County   He said that President Young said when He first came in in a   speech that we should lay up grain for a 7 yea[r]s famine & we   should let the land rest on the 7th year Brother Woodruff   herd it. (Brother Woodruff said it was written) Now the US  are trying to force a Govornor upon us we will not Receive   him the Lord has said our govornor will procede out of the midst   of us this is in the Bible Brother Woodruff turn to it. (Brother   Woodruff opened the Bible promiscously & opened diretly to the   passage in the 30 chapter of Jeremiah 21st verse) & read it   to the congregation. mMany remarks were made by the speaker all   of which are reported. In the After noon John Taylor spoke   lengthy had much of the spirit of the Lord & the people were   Edifyed He was followed By President Daniel H Wells who   also spoke in the spirit & Power of God concerning Zion   the armies of Israel, & the armies of the wicked He was   ready to fight & defend Zion, all was reported       We went to the prayer Circle President Young was sick but   he was in the Circle said he could not feel that the Enemy   would come this season      August 24, 1857 ~ Monday      24th I spent the day in the office on Brother Kimballs History      August 25, 1857 ~ Tuesday      25 I spent this day in the office on History      August 26, 1857 ~ Wednesday      26th [FIGURE]  I budded a few peach trees early in the morning I called   in Presidents Young Office An express had come in from deer   Creek Brought the report that our Emigration was getting along     
 Aug 26 1857  vary well the Chianes [Cheyennes] had stolen 480 Head of General Harne's  Beef Cattle. Col Sumner had been out with his command 10 day   longer than He was rationed for & fears of his friends was   that He was cut off General Harney was intending to remove  all mormon stations on the road & go by forced marches so that   no word would reach the mormons in Utah before him   President Young said I have sent General Harney word that I   wish for peace & do not wish to fight any body but He must  not come Here with his armey if he undertakes it I shall   stop him. He said to Brother Mathews when you get in   Calafornia the people will try to stop you & hedge you up so   that you cannot strengthen us you must be upon the   watch tower. The Nation is determined to make us free   they are determined to drive us to defend our selves & become   independant. The Nation is breaking to peases in spirit their   is no Union among them & before the United States get through   trying to destroy us they will want to let out the Job I told   the people years ago that if they would let us alone we would Convert   & revolutionize the world if they did not let us alone but undertake   take to break us up we should spread abroad the faster & do the   work so much the sooner & we will do it if this nation now   makes war upon us we will be free & build up the kingdom   of God the sooner. The people have tried all the time to destroy   us but they have failed all the time when the government called   for 500 of our men they had no idea that we would comply   with their request this plan was laid to destroy the saints & tomas   Benton then had orders in his pocket to destroy the Mormons   if they refused Jesus said the time would come when we should   sell our coat & buy a sword, that time has come and we have got   to go & deliver ourselves from our enemies & the Lord will   help us He will fight our battles & we will become an independant   kingdom. I feel well & I will tell you why if I am right   and I know I am and that is this people are now much   nearer their Fathers face than they ever were before they   are united and willing to do the will of God and this causes   me to rejoice. The people now fell to say it is the kingdom   of God or nothing it is not my farm or my house but the   kingdom of God this is the case with this people. Brother   Kimball said Old Buck was now free the yoke was off his   neck & it would not be upon his neck again. Many other   remarks were made but not written. There were present   B. Young H C. Kimball D H. Wells O Hyde W Woodruff   J Taylor Capt Hooper Joseph Young Ferrymore Little   President Young said that I am satisfied that the Post Master   in Calafornia was authorized to open our Mail & read   our Letters & retain what He pleased & send on what   He pleased I will insure that our Letters to the Elders on   the Isles of the Sea will be opened & read I pray the Lord   to reveal to those Brethren what our desire is that they   may come home.      President Young came into the Histor-  ians office at 15 minuts to 2 oclok He sent for me I was   at home I immediately went to the office. Presidents   Young Wells & F D Richards was in the office. President Young said     
 to me as I came in have you a team I told him I had   a pair of small Ponies. He asked If I could spare them  I Hesitated a moment & said IYes sir, I can do any   thing that is wanted. He then said I have a good   pair of Horses that I want to let you have, as you are   labouring here I was taken quite surprised it came  vary unexpeted to me. I excepted the Horses & was   thankful though perhaps I did not say it at the time   Brother Wells went & showed them to me I tok them  home they were a fine large pair of sorrell Horses   they were offered 200 bushels of wheat for them   to day. President Young stayid 3 1/2 hours in  compiling his History. He remarked that the revelation upon   a plurality of wives was given to Joseph Smith in 1831 He revealed   it to Oliver Cowdery alone upon the solem pledge that He would not   reveal it or act upon it it but He did act upon it in a secret manner   & that was the cause of his overthrow. President Young also said   that the United States are driving this people to war sooner than  is for their good for we are civilizing the Indians & if they would   give us time we would give them a knowledge so that when they   do fight the Gentiles that they would have some Judgment & not   kill women & Children & those who ought tonot to be killed. There is   now many of the emigration on the way to Carson valley the Gentile   emigrants shoot the indians wharever they meet with them & the   Indians now retaliate & will kill innocent People. One woman who   had fitted out to kome here to investigate Mormonism she was   killed & all her teamsters & all these through the folly of Emigrants      August 27, 1857 ~ Thursday      27th I spent the fore noon in the office the afternoon I watered my   garden & budded my peach orchard with Carringtons 2nd Early  & his large yellow Peach & Apricott      August 28, 1857 ~ Friday      28th I spent the forepart of the day in the House of the Lord giving   Endowments the evening I spent in the office      [FIGURE] The present signs of the times show that we as a people   as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints & the   Kingdom of God are approaching the most important period &   Craices [crisis] that we have ever seen since the organization of the   Church, their is a solemnity & anxiety resting upon all Israel.   The Government of the United States have now entered the   field as our persecuters & are determined in their harts to destr-  oy us from off the Earth as far as it is in their power   The President James Buch^a^nnan & the Congress of the Nation   containing 35000000 people have sent an Armey of men   of numbering some 3000 armed with all instruments of   death to destroy us as a people they are now marching towards   us upon the plains & one or two month from this date must   decide the case with us whether we have to go out to war and   meet in deadly combat this winter or not. The Gentiles are vary   wicked & the cup of the United States as a Nation is full & they   are enemies to God & his kingdom & people they are determined   in their hearts that God & his Christ shall have no kingdom on   the Earth & they are now about to make war upon his saints   the time is at the door that will try mens souls the Lord has     
 Aug. 28th 1857  promised to fight the battles of his saints nevertheless the saints   will be tried whether they will abide in his covenant even   unto death whether we are willing to lay down our lives for   Christ sake, word has been sent out to call in the Elders from   abroad from among the Gentiles, & the gospel has begun to go to   the Lamanites & the Lord is about to remember his covenant   with that people, the Judgments of our God must now soon be   poured out upon the Gentile world & the children of Jacob &   the House of Israel must go forth & fulfill their destiny & help   build up Zion all nations are becomeing vary wicked may   the Lord give us grace according to our day & help us to stand   the test & prove in the hour of trial & temptation torue to our God, our   Brethren, & our covenants. And I ask the Lord in the Name of Jesus   Christ to Preserve the Presidency of this Church with the cities   people & Records of the Saints from the hands of wicked and   ungodly men. I pray that the Lord will preserve me for a   season that I may labour to assist in preserving & keeping   a record of this Church & kingdom & the dealings of God   with us & preserve me O Lord from dishonouring my calling   or priesthood but give me faith power & grace to pass through   what ever I may be called to meet. It appears as though   the whole world was about to make war upon the kingdom   of God. In years that are past & gone we have had towns   cities, counties & states with the Govornor & people against   us. Now the whole Nation has risen up against us, vary   well, let lightnings flash & thunders roll & Earth quake bellow   and let all hells dark Hosts gather in battle array against   God and his Christ against the Church & kingdom of our God against   Brigham Heber & Daniel & the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb   of God & all ther followers Let the Heathen rage & the people   imagin vain things let them take council to destroy the   Lords Anointed. Yet God will laugh at their calamity   & mock when their fear comes for their destruction  shall come like a whirlwind even in an instant suddenly   it shall over take them like a woman in treval & their   shall be no power to deliver, & all the Judgments which God   the Lord, or Prophets Apostles or Holy men have said shall   come upon them shall be fulfilled upon their heads & not   one Jot or tittle shall fail. Rejoice O ye Heavens & be Glad   O Earth & all the righteous who dwell therein for the Lord   God Omnipitent reigneth & his will will be done in all   things for he holds the destiny of all men in his hands   the wicked as well as the righteous. Let the prayers of thy people   O God come up into thine Eares & let them be answered upon the   Head of the wicked & Let the blood of all thy Prophets O God   be avenged upon the Earth untill the wicked shall scease to reign   & untill the Earth shall be cleansed from all the abomination  which now dwell upon it fulfill thy covenants O God which   thou hast made with Israel in the Last days & let the Gentiles   who dwell upon this land be spedily cut off inasmuch as they   will not repent. Send they Judgments O God into the Armies   of the United States who are coming against us to battle & let   them be destroyed that they shall have no power over thy saints   any more at all

S. Eldridge  & Goosebeck. President Young said Brother Bernhisel I presume   we shall not have any one in Congress next winter to present  our memorials & interest (J.M.B. No I think not) I think it  will make some of the People squirm when they hear that I am   taking the property which the Government has sent into this   Territory some of our Brethren going down to the states met  about 60 of the Chians they were vary Friendly to them   the Indians stole 800 fat cattle & the rest was driven back   to the states so the Army has no cattle with them ownly for  their present use some said that they believed that those   Indians who stole the cattle were half mormon & began to  dam them Brother Murdock remarked we are all mormons here   in this company & I dont wish to hear my friends abused  President Young said what will the people think in Europe when  they come to hear that Brigham Young is at the Head of   the vigilance committies in Calafornia & the Cansas Troubles   & that the Government of the United States could not remove   him untill the Lord see fit to let them. The world accuse me  of controlling the affiairs of Calafornia & Kansas &c the people  do believe that we have a Band called the Danites but how   could they exist so long without sheding Blood for we cannot   find that they have killed any body But I do not know of any   such men. I think that James Buchanan has got in a Bad  fix he has got the yoke on his neck & has to carry it alone     
 with no ox to carry the other End but He is pounding his own shins  & will soon pound the shins of others for the moment He gave   consent to send an armey to destroy this people he placed himself   as the shedder of innocent Blood & the Judgments of God will   follow him. when war does break out between the north & south   it will be the most bloody. G A. Smith said that the ownly thing for  the President of the United States to get out of his trouble ownly to   get a Bill through Congress to admit any territory as soon   as they had population Enough to organize a State Government   & to be received at once into the Government or Union with   equal privileges with the other States. President Young then said let  me suggest a matter Brother Smith is presiding at Limhi salmon  River now do we not want a station about half way from  here say near fort Hall should we not send men say 20 to   make a station there it was thought best to do so. He said that  the north is the place for us & not the south no one but the   saints would want the cold North country. This is the [FIGURE] of  this Continent & I think we had better keep near the lock   & kepp the [FIGURE] in our own hand. If we send a company we   want to send them this fall so that we can put in grain   there this season      6th President Young came into the office a short time Thomas B   Marsh spent the fore noon with us helping about his history  I spent most of the day oin the office      September 7, 1857 ~ Monday      7th I budded some peach trees this morning I went to the office at 11 oclok  & spent the remainder of the day in the office      September 8, 1857 ~ Tuesday      8th I budded peach trees in the morning & spent most of the   day in the office. Capt Van Vlvleeit arived this evening   in this City he had an Interview with Gov Young  in the evening      September 9, 1857 ~ Wednesday      9th Capt Van vleeit met with the Govornor in the   social Hall at 9 oclok with the presidency & Twelve  & some 100 citizens He presented Gov Young with  a letter of Instructions or request which was read   before the assembly & but little said & a great deal  thought. Capt van vleeit asked if there was lumber  to be bought & grain & Hay &c president said that  there was a plenty in the country. President Young asked   if there was any one present who could supply capt  Van vleeit any lumber that He wanted Brother Samuel  Snider arose & said that that He could supply 40000 feet   of Lumber. No other one said any thing President Young  took had private conversation with the Captain in the  afternoon President Young walked with Captain Van Vliet  through his Garden & orchard & through Professor Carringt-  ons the Capt Asked Mrs Carrington if she was willing to   cut down her fine peach orchard for her faith &  Religin she said "yes and would set up nights to do  it if it became necessary     
 September 10, 1857 ~ Thursday      10th I went into the Big field with a Brother Thomas to set  him to work ploughing my field for wheat. I spent   the afternoon in the office I heard G A Smith's History   read. President Young took Capt Stewart Van Vliet   through his house introduced him to his family &c      September 11, 1857 ~ Friday      11th I spent this day in the Endowment House we gave  83 their endowment.      September 12, 1857 ~ Saturday      12th We got in an express this morning saying that ther   was some 900 troops on the way this side of Laramie  & some 12 government Baggage trains. Capt Van Vlieeit  came into the office & President Young had a good deal   of conversation with him. He said to him I do not   want to fight the United States but if they drive  us to it we shall do the best we can & I will tell you  as God lives that we shall come off conquerer for   we trust in God. For God has set up his kingdom  on the Earth & it will never fall but it will stand  we shall do all we can not to fight but if they drive   us to it God will overthrow them. if they would let   us alone & say to the mobs now you may go & kill the   Mormons if you can but we will have nothing to do with it   this is all we would ask of them But for the Government   of the United States to array their armies against us   it is to despicable & damnable for any honorable Nation  & God will have them in derission for doing it. The Govern-  ment has all the time endeavoured to destroy us in an under-  handed manner. But Now if they come against us   we will whip them all the time and you will see   that we will do it. The United States are sending their  armies to hold us still untill a Mob can come and   kill us and they have done this all time. we are the  supporters of the United States Constitution, & we love   the Constitution & Laws of the United States. But it is  the corrupt Administration of those Laws which we  are suffering under & not the Laws. if the Laws had   been carried out in Missouri it would have hung Gov   Boggs Between the heavens & the Earth and all his friends  who was in the murdering & expelling the Saints from   the states they shot down the mormons whenever they   could. They killed Joseph & Hiram. Then when Col   Harden came into Nauvoo with his armey He did not inq-  uire who killed Joseph Smith or Hiram or any of the  saints who had been killed but enquired for some missing   Man that we knew Nothing about & said he should Hold   me responsible for the life of that man. This has been the   course with the Government all the time. We got up a   Memorial or declaration to the Congress of the United   States last winter the Declaration was then read to the   Capt Van Vleeit after hearing it he said I cannot  find any fault with it ownly it is couched in vary   strong language. President Young said that is what I   intended. And I will now ask capt Van Vleit if     
 Aug 12, 1857  noDrummond was not the maine cause of the United States sending   thereir Armies against us "I think it is. There is not any  of the government officers which have been sent here   who have any interest with us But they have tried  to destroy us. Capt van vleit said this is the case  with most men in the Territories they received their  offices as a steping stone to the senatorship, but they have  no interest for the people. This people have been lied about the  worst of any people I ever saw the greatest hold the world   have now upon you is they accuse you of Burning 900 vol   of the United States Statutes. Thomas Williams who was one   of the owners of the Books which were burned denies their   being any Books of the United States being burned. I have   told the people all the time all I asked of them was to tell   the truth about us to pay their debts & steal Nothing they  are welcome to go their way. No[w] if this government  has arived at that state that they will tri to kill   the people for their religion No honorable man   should be afraid of them. President Young then told   the story about the Quaker that a Yankey went to whip  the Quaker said that he was not the man that he wanted  He had not done any thing wrong but the man said He would   whip him any how so the Quaker laid down his hat & coat   & said lie there religion untill I whip this man & he did  whip him tremendiously. It will be so with the United States   if they insist in whiping us they will get awfully whiped  Capt Van Vleit we have treated all men as well as we   have you who have been sent here as officers of the US   government. we wish still to treat them well and we   would like to ward off this Blow if we could But   the United States are determined to drive us to fight  we cannot do any thing but what the government will take   exception to it. They will kill us if they can I have prof   of this. They killed Joseph & Hiram in Jail not with stand-  ing the faith of the Govornor the Armey & the states was   pleged to protect them, & when they had killed them  they then got a writ for me I carried a large Bowie   knife with me and I said that any man that laid hands  upon my sholder and said Mr Young you are my prisioner   I would send that man to hell across lots & I have said   that all the time since and I say it now I have broaken   now law neither will I be taken by any United States  officers to be killed as they have killed Joseph. They did   once take a Bogus Brigham which was Brother Miller   & took him to Carthage & did not find out his mistake   untill they got him there. Capt Van vleit said that  I do not think that it is the intention of the Government to  take you but to instill a New Governor in this Territory  President Young said I Believe that you tell the truth that   you believe this but you do not know their intentions as well  as I do. when you get away from here you will think   of a great many things which you have seen and heard  The people have all the time accused us of Colleagueing with the  Indians against the Government & they were much afraid     
 that Joseph Smith would go amoung the Indians & they   watched to keep him away from them but now they   have driven us into their midst and now I want you to   watch the signs of the times & you will see that God will   work against that Nations who are trying to destroy both   the Indians & Mormons the Government has become corrupt   & they are the ones who are breaking the Constitution of  the United [States] & if it is ever saved it will be saved by the   Mormons who are the Elders of Israel      September 13, 1857 ~ Sunday      13th Sunday I arose in the morning saddled my horse rode   into my field 4 miles & back I then went to the House of   Sister Foss & laid hands upon her with Brother Smoot as she   was sick we then went to Meeting in the Tabernacle &   John Taylor Preached a splendid discourse upon the first   Principles of the gospel. He was followed by President   Brigham Young who said that he had had the persecu-  tions of the Saints before him all the morning that He   was righteously angry He was so angry he could   not preach. But He did preach in the power of God   & told the people his Feelings. Capt Van Vleit set by   & when President Young spoke of the wickedness & cor-  ruption of the government it made him feel at   the close of the meeting we met with the missionaries   who were appointed to lecture upon the subject of Home   Manufacturing we then went into council with the   presidency to select a company of missionaries to go   & make a settlement on Black foot fork 63 volunteered   & 42 of them were chosen at the close of this council I  went direct to the Meeting at the Tabernacle Charles R Daina  spoke first He had Just returned from England when   he went on his mission the Twelve Blessed him I was   mouth He said evry word which I proclaimed upon his   head was fulfilled to the vary letter. He was followed by   G. A. Smith who spoke of his southern tour, &c He   was followed by President Young who gave Uncle Sam   considerable Hell fire for their wickedness. At the   close of the meeting I met with the Missionaries again   President Young made a few remarks to them upon their   organization. we then went into our Prayer Circle & Presi-  dent Young feasted the Breathrens upon Peaches & grapes   as we had so many meetings we had had no time for Eating   through the day at the close of the prayer Capt Van Vleit   met us at the close of the Stairs & said he had an express   from the states & wished to meet with Gov Young   I then went to the Historians office & prepaired   [FIGURE] 3 letters to I. F. Carter to O. Pratt & T. B. H   Stenhouse I then went to Capt Hoopers & met   with Capt Van Vleit a short time after President   Brigham Young H C Kimball D. H. Wells A. Carrington   O Hyde J Taylor & a number of others. Capt Van Vleit   was preparing to leave at 3 oclok in the morning President   Young was now to have his last interview with him   & he wished to talk to him in a plain manner He said     
 He wished Capt Van Vliet to report at Washington Just   as things were here He said I have seen the suffering   of this people through the Persecutions of the people of   the United States for the last 25 years and I will not   bear it any longer. we have always treated the United   States officers well but they have constantly lied abo-  ut us & tried to destroy us all the time. we would still   have received their govornors & officers if they had   sent them here without an Army but inasmuch as   they are now disposed to send an Armey here to   hold us still while others run their read hot Iron   into us & then kill us we will now say that we will   not have neither their soldiers Armies or officers   any more here at all, and you may tel them so we will   Just fight for our liberty & rights from this day forth whenever   I think of letting their troops come in here and their   officers I can see nothing but death & darkness before me and   before this people but when I say they shall not come here   light bursts upon me and I can see life before me & this  people and this is the way all of this people feel. the intention   of the Government is to destroy us & this we are determin   they shall not do. If the government of the United   States persists in sending Armies to destroy us in the name   of the Lord we shall conquer them. if the Government   calls for volunteers in Calafornia & the people turn out to come   to destroy us they will find their own buildings in flames before   they get far from home & so throughout the United States   again if they commence the war I shall not hold the Indians   still by the [w]rist any longer for white men to shoot at them but   I shall let them go ahead & do as they please and I shall  carry the war into their own land and they will want to let   out the Job before they get half through and even should an   Armey of 50000 men get into this valley when they got   here they would find nothing but a Barren waste we  should burn evry thing that was wood & evry acre of   grass that would burn and you may tell them that they   must bring with them their forage for their animals   for they will not find any thing to eat in this Territory   when they come, again you may tell them they must stop   all emigration across this continent for they cannot travel   in safety the Indians will kill all that attempt it. You may  tell Judge Douglass that when He comes here again to enter   into a treaty of peace we shall dictate those terms of peace   & not him as He did before.      Capt Van Vleit said that    if our Government pushed forward this thing & made war   upon us He should withdraw from the Army for he would   not have a hand in sheding the Blood of American Citizens  After closing HeHis remarks President Young said God had   set up his kingdom upon the Earth & it was here & the Lord   would sustain that kingdom & he would destroy all that   fought against it And if the Armies of the United [States] came   against us the Lord would permit them to be destroyed at the   close of the remarks the President said to Capt Van Vleit as citizens   we are friends & shook hands in a Friendly manner and

 September 20, 1857 ~ Sunday      20th Sunday I was quite sick all day I did not attend the meeting   through the day I attended the prayer circle in the evening      September 21, 1857 ~ Monday to September 24, 1857 ~ Thursday      21st 22nd 23 & 24 I spent this time in threshing out my   wheat I was sick & not able to labour but I stood at the   tale End of the threshing mashine for three days with a   severe cold sore throat sumthing like the Quincy I was up Early   & late & hard at work my cold broke up on the 24th & I was   better I had 500 bushels of wheat on 12 1/2 Acres making   Just 40 bushels to the Acre I sowed one bushel of clear   white club on one Acre of ground the poorest acre I had   & it had no water that produced Just 40 bushel but some   smut but no smut in my [tause].

Elder Nathaniel V. Jones   arived this morning for [from] the United States Armey with the express   He visited with Capt Van vleit both Ritedjments the first   was the 10th Ridgment that was a full Regiment the officers   were young & full of fire & they swore they would come   in any how they could whip out Utah Capt van vleit   advised them not to come for they could get nothing   they would have to fight their way but they swore   they would fight their way through after van vleit   left them they marched 30 miles instead of 15 the next day,   the 2nd Riegiment he met with they were old officers they   considered the matter over more & thought it an imposition   to be sent out here as a political movement to kill innocent   people or to get killed they will be at the pacific springs   to night & our Brethren will commence operation upon   them      September 26, 1857 ~ Saturday      26th I did not feel well this morning I was quite poorly I opened   2 Boxes of Goods which Dr Bernhisel sent me the most of   which I took to His family by his order. I had some conversa-  tion with Gen D. H. Wells upon the subject of going into the mount-  ains He said He should soon go take with him G. A. Smith & John   Taylor as his councellors take but a part of his staff he wished   me to stay at home in the office for the present this was according   to council. The following conversation passed between President   Young & Capt Van Vleit not before recorded in this Journal. Capt   van vleit said I think that Congress will try to do all they   can against you. President Young said if God inspires   any man to speak for us it will be well we have got   to trust in God If you will speak in favor of us &   I think you will the Lord will bless you for so   doing He will require it of you. we have refuted lies   so long we have got tiered of it and we shall now trust   in God for the future. Congress could send out an inves-  tigating committee to Kansas or any other place but to     
 Utah but upon the mere rumour of liars they could send   out 2000 armed soldiers to Utah to destroy the people without  investigating the subject at all. Capt Van Vleit said the   Government may yet send out one to Utah & consider   it policy before they get through with it. President Young said   I do think that God has sent you out here & that Good   will grow out of it I was glad when I learned that   you was coming. Capt Van vleit said I am vary   anxious to get back to Washington as soon as I can   I herd officially that General Harney was recalled to Kansas   to officiate as Govornor I shall stop the train on hams   fork on my own responsibility, & leave them there   President Young said if we can Ceep the peace for this winter   I do think there will be sumthing turn up that may save   so much shedding of Blood. Capt V. said I think so   to the troops will have to stop on hams fork for their   provisions will be late coming up I do not think their   is more than 1000 troops coming their is one rigment   from the florida war their is not more than 300 men   they have been reduced by the scurvey that florida   war has cost many millions of money it is a specu-  lating scheme their is not more than 100 warriors   & they have got hiding places which No man can find   it is seldom you can kill one you may accidentally   stumball onto one as you would a partridge, well   this regiment are old men & the regiment is worn out      September 27, 1857 ~ Sunday      27th Sunday I called upon Elder Taylor in the Morning   to get the History of Joseph which He had written   but He informed me he had left it at the Historians office   the evening before He was about preparing to go into the   Mountains with G. A. Smith & Gen D. H. Wells & his   staff or a part of it they got ready & left the City   about 1 oclok P.M. I attended meeting in the tabernacle   the returned Missionaries occupied the fore noon untill   near 12 oclok I then addressed the people for a short   time. In the afternoon Brother Case from the Cherikes [Cherokee]  Nation spoke a short time was followed by Heber C Kimb-  all who gave a vary interesting discourse. I attended   the prayer Meeting in the evening President Young was   quite unwell.      September 28, 1857 ~ Monday      28th we received an express this morning from   the Army in the Mountains saying that our enemies   were marching strongly towards us they tryed to stamped   the Animals of the Army but found them all chained by   the feet so they could not run a small company also   tried to stampede some oxen & they failed in [it]. Brother   Jones informed me that Capt Van vleit tried to pursuade   the Armey to stay on hams fork to winter or in that   region but the 10th Regiment swore that they had started   for salt Lake & they would go there. Capt Van vleit told   them that we should not let them come but they would   find a diferent warfare from any thing they had met with     
 the day was occupied by getting the Brethren ready for the mountains  & going out quite a company went out I do not know the   number      September 29, 1857 ~ Tuesday      29th we have another Express in this morning saying that   the Armey are rapidly marching towards us will soon   be at Bridger & they wish men immediately sent out.  Elder John D. Lee also arived from Harmony with an express  [FIGURE] and an awful tale of Blood a company of Calafornia  Emigrants of about 150 men women & children many of  them belonged to the mob in Missouri & Illinois they had many  cattle & Horses with them as they travelled along south they  went damning Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball & the Heads of   the Church saying that Joseph Smith ought to have been shot  a long time before he was. they wanted to do all the evil they   could so they poisoned Beef & gave it to the Indians & some  of them died they poisioned the springs of water several of   the saints died the Indians became inraged at their conduct  & they surrounded them on a prairie & the Emigrants   formed a Bulwark of ther waggons & dug an Entrench-  ment up to the Hubs of there waggons but the Indians fought  them 5 days untill they killed all their men about  60 in Number they then rushed into their carrall &  cut the throats of their women & children except a  some 8 or 10 children which they brought & sold to the  whites they striped the men & women Naked & left   them stinking in the boiling sun when Brother Lee found   it out he took some men & went & buried their bodies  it was a horrid awful Job the whole air was filled with  an awful stench many of the men & women was rotten  with the pox before they were hurt by the Indians. the   Indians obtained all ther cattle Horses & property guns &c  their was another large company of Emigrants who had  1000 head of cattle who was also damning both Indians   & Mormons they were afraid of shareing the same fate  Brother Lee had to send interpeters with them to the Indians  to try to save their lives while at the same time they are   trying to kill us.      we spent most of the day in trying to get the Brethren ready  to go to the Mountains Brother Brigham when speaking of   the cutting of the throats of women & children [ai] the Indians   done south said that it was heart rending that Emigration   must stop as he had before said Brother Lee said that   He did not think their was a drop of innocent Blood in  their camp for he had too of their children in his  house & he could not get but one to kneel down in prayer   time & the other would laugh at her for doing it & they wo-  uld sware like pirats. The scene of Blood has commenced   & Joseph said we should see so much of it that it  would make our hearts sick. I spent the fore part of the  night getting Robert & Wilford ready to go to the mountains      30th I arose Early this morning & took my horses & put  them with parley P Pratts Mules to draw the Bagage     
 waggon for 50 men that was called out of the 14th ward  they were to start at 6 oclok but did not get ready till  8 oclok I finally concluded to let Robert go & retain   Wilford a few days for they had left their wheat Bag standing  in the field whare they had been sowing through the day & the  ground not dragged whare they had sowed they started about   9 oclok I then went & took some things to the fair then went   into the field, finished sowing a 5 acre lot & Draged it in  took a load of corn & come home I then heard that Dr  Hurt had got 300 Indians around him & ran away to the   states we got An express in to night saying that the  troops were near Bridger had formed into 3 Bodies  in travelling Cummings said that if they marched to Bridger  He should fight them General Wells sent word for   them to let them come on to Echo Canyon & there give  them Battle      September 30, 1857 ~ Wednesday      30th I met at 9 oclock at the Deseret Store with the committee  on fruit & flowers & awarded premiums according to the  best of our Judgment other Committies met but their were   so many of the Brethren gone to the Mountains to meet the   Enemy that but little is doing in the fair. At 6 oclok this  morning the drums beat & an army of soldiers parraded in   our streets of some 400 who were in readiness to march  at a moments warning to the seat of war when ordered  we have about 800 men in the Mountains it is a solmum  time the Armies of the Gentiles are making war upon us  because of our religion & we have to defend ourselves against   a Nation of 25,000000 of people & the war has just commenced  we have to trust in God for the result. we shall do what we can   & leave the work in his hands their is a still solemnity resting  over our City all are anxiously awaiting the arival of the express  I told President Young that I was on hand any moment to  go into the mountains that He would say the word.

He was followed by Brother Kimball who   said that He knew that if we would Harken to council that we   should raise grain, oat peaches & Apples & live in our Houses in these   vallies untill we went to Jackson County President Young said   I believe it. I attended the prayer meeting in the evening. O P Roc-  kwell & Dunbar arived about [blank] oclok reported that there   would be 700 Head of cattle in in 2 days nothing decisive yet in   relation to the army He said some of the Brethren were ventersome   and in danger of looseing their lives He said one deserter   informed him that the army were ownly fed on Quarter rations  the army are nearly starving to death.

Capt Smith replied I can see as well as   you can with your Blind Bridles on they looked at each   other awhile the[n] Lot Smith troted off at a slow pace but the   Enemy tried to surround them & they had to gallop over a   vary rough place to get away when they got about 30 rods   off from them the[y] dis mounted & took a dead rest & shot   about 30 bullets at them one ball passed through one mans   Hat & another Ball grazed a horses leg that was all the dange  that was done they might thank the Lord for the preservation   of their lives this is the first fireing done on Either side &   this fireing was done by our Enemies, but no Blood shed   unless it was Blood from a horses leg. We got through   diging potatoes & drawing corn to day      October 20, 1857 ~ Tuesday      2  20th I put my flax in water to rot this morning at 12 oclok  Col Burton with his command of Draggoons or minute   men arived in this City in good health & spirits. President   Heber C Kimball addressed them a short time And said   By virtue of the Office which I hold I bless you all in the   name of the Lord & if you will live your religion & do   right you shall none of you fall by the Hand of an Enemy  but you shall eat peaches & Apples in this valley untill you   go to Jackson County Missouri & your Enemies shall not   conquer you. keep your guns & fire locks in good order &   do not waste your aminition for Naught, it is not a   day for much preaching but a day for hard service this   is not much that we have to meet with this fall but next   year we must be prepared for work Gen Grant followed   with few words & told then whare to go for quarters  they went to the variouse places allotted them. I spent the   day in the office. I spent the night or evening till 9 oclok at the Govornors   Office Brigham Young Jr arived at 9 oclok He rode down the Weber to   Ogden from there to this City. He brought some Letters to the president   & others. I stoped at the Globe a short time in conversation   with Brother Clements who thinks that Allexander would   surrender if he had an opportunity to do it in a way that He would  not be censured by the Government. The army is in a critical   situation & destruction seems to await them let them do what  they will     
 October 21, 1857 ~ Wednesday      Oct 21st   Brother Atwood arived this morning with an express from Gen   Wells & 2 letters from Col Allexander who closed his letter by   saying that "He should not obey the Govornors orders & his final   disposals of the troops would depend upon Grave consideration which   I do not deem necessary to enumerate" (words without meaning)   The messenger said that the 5th Regment had stoped near Bear River   in tents, the 10th Regment had moved back on hams fork 5 miles   with all the teams & baggage they were in the snow several inches   deep the Brethren travelled several miles with the army the men   were so week & cold they would wrap up in their coat & lie down   in the snow to rest almost evry mile we cannot tell what   the intentions of the officers of the Army are. President Young   thinks that Col Allexanders intention is to come nearer our camp   so that his men may desert. Robert Burton said that it was 80   miles from Allexanders command to the mouth of Echo Canyon   President Young said Here are the officers around me I will call   a council of war. I think it is best for Gen Wells to call  in all his forces to Echo & there rest & not ride his Horses   to death unnecessary but let the Enemy alone now & they will   soon use themselves up keep a few to watch there movements   & let them work & they will all soon be used up. Dr Hickman   is with the 5th Regiment who are left & Allen & his companies   are with the 10th Regiment. Heber Kimball Jr sent Col Allexan-  der a doz onions & the Col said if he had any thing that   Heber wanted He would send it to him. He asked Beaty why   He tryed to stampede their animals and burn the grass He   said we burn the grass to get a better crop next year. I spent   most of the fore part of the day in reading the History of the death   of Joseph & comparing John Taylors account with it some 7 or  800 head of cattle were drove in about 12 oclok accompanied   by some teamsters & soldiers they looked poor & hungry I spent   a short time with President Young in the evening      October 22, 1857 ~ Thursday      22nd I spent most of the day in ploughing I gleaned 17 Bushels   of potatoes on 1 1/2 acres after my men had dug the ground   over I spent the evening in the Historians office on Presidents   Brigham Youngs History      October 23, 1857 ~ Friday      23rd I spent most of the day in the office on Brigham Youngs   History. President Young received a letter from Gen Wells, not   much news      October 24, 1857 ~ Saturday      24th I called upon President Young a short time Brothers   Kimball & Lyman ^&^ Lorenzo Snow was also in a few remarks   were made about the Armey Brother Brigham said that He was   satisfied that we could live in this valley & raise crops and   keep our enemies out it is not in their power to he overthrow   us by the Help of God we can remain here & they can not   conquer us I have reflected this thing over in my mind   to see what way I could conquer this people if I was there   And I cannot see but one way & that way they will not   attempt to take The United States have spent three Millions of   dollars this season to fit out an Armey to destroy us &     
 October 24, 1857 ~ Saturday      Oct 24th   And it has done us no harm But if I was going to   attempt to destroy this people I should have let them have   there post office and made One Millions of Dollars of   Appropriation & given them all they asked for then spent   annother Million in carrying in Gentiles & Merchandize &  kept this up yearly untill I had filled the country with   Gentiles but the Lord would not let them do this but I should   know that I could not quer conquer them by forc & they   will find it out. President Young got a letter to day from   Gen Wells who says the Enemy have returned back on   Hams Fork some 15 miles      I had a company of men who were lying in camp from   Toelle City call & Husk out 110 Bushels of Ears of corn   for me I gave them One 10th for husking I spent most of   the day on B. Youngs History. Broth J. V. Long Buried   a child to day 1 year 8 months & 11 days old which died on   the 23rd      October 25, 1857 ~ Sunday      25th Sunday I attended the meeting in the Tabernacle John Young   preached in the Morning followed by Lorenzo Young & Brigham   Young we had a good meeting. The Lord is manifesting great wis-  dom through President Brigham Young as a Prophet & leader   in Israel He corrects the Errors of all his brethren in such a   way it is clearly manifest in the Eyes of all the people.      I attended the prayer Circle in the evening at 4 oclok Gen D H.   Wells & Elders John Taylor & G A. Smith arived from the Head   quarters of the Army met in council with us & spent some   time in conversing upon the subjet of the war. President Young   said I mean to send word to the United States that if they have   sent troops here the cattle which we have taken I will give   them credit for upon compound interest but I do not   know that they have sent any they have not notifyed me   officially any thing about it & I have no right to know   any thing about it but shall treat them as a mob      October 26, 1857 ~ Monday      26th Brother Peter W Conover & Oliver Smith arived   in this City this morning & called at Presidents Youngs   office & brought the news from our Carson valley company   they gave a Rehearsal of all their travels to carson   Valley & Calafornia & back again which was Highly  interesting the company of the Carson valley saints & those   from Calafornia & Oregon were on the way to this City   they had 160 fighting men with 2700 lbs of Ammuni-  tion belonging to the Church & a great deal with private   individuals & a large amount of Arms. all the Saints are   coming from Carson valley they left ownly 2 Boxes  of caps & 1 lb of powder in all Carson Valley they sold all   their arms & ammunition to the Brethren for their places. President   Young also received a letter from Gen Grant the Army were  still on hams Fork not desided which route they would yet   take they had got the Chief waggon Master in custidy      The presidency and Twelve were in conversation all the fore noon   at his office upon the subjet of the war. President Young said     
 Oct 26  That the United States Govornment was looseing their Nation-  al greatness & wisdom is departed from them and we need   not have as much fear of them as we would of an Armey   of Grass hoppers if they take away our charter from us & divide   up our Territory it will be Unconstitutional as evry thing is they   do against us. I told Brother Bernhisel that if they took   away our charters to come immediately home as soon as He   could & we would organize our State Government & fall   back upon our original Boundaries. Our East Boundary should  be at Laramie the west the summit of the Siera Nevada & run to the   pacific Ocean &c & we would defend it. John Taylor who sat   in the Judgment seat Saith that was our legal Lawful & Legitimat   right. President Young said I want Sanbernadeno & Carson valley   to remain & not be disturbed for I want the people there to raise  stock to supply us from time to time as we need. The U.S.   may do as they please we will do as the Lord wants us. One   young officer of the Army said that Old Jesus Christ could   not keep him out of salt Lake City But they will find   out who rules on Earth & in heaven. Another officer said   the United States would wipe us out another year should   they send an Army of 20000 men it would take more than   20 miles for their armey & train to move at all and the more there   is off them the worse off they will be. Mr Ray called upon   President Young and wished him to buy his goods. He told   him his goods were a poor lot in camparison to Mr Bells   yet if ^Br^ Hooper would buy him out He would back him   up, president Young also told Mr Ray that He would   give him a little council if He would take it. He told him   to stop taking opium and Alchohol and stop your fears and   hold up your head and be cheerful "Mr Ray I will now   tel you the truth. The Gentile Merchants with yourself   have been the means of Bringing on this present war you   have been selling my Blood & the Blood of my Brethren   from for Gold this I shall not put up with it any longer   I shall not permit any Gentile merchant to do business in   [the] territory after this year in the way they have we have been   kind to them & I have been their friend & our people have   paid them promptly & they should have been our friends   & told the truth about us but they have not realized   what they were doing.["] many other remarks were made  Brother Taylor said will not the armey go into winter   Quarters & entrench themselves & remain untill they get help   from the states. President Young said if an army comes to   help them in the spring we will use up this army first &   then we will use up the other before they get to the south   Pass. In the spring we must ask Allexander what He intends   to do inform him He must not stay there untill He gets rein-  forcements in the spring and if they will not leave in the   spring we will use them up first the best we can in 10 days   we can put 2000 men around them which would soon use   them up. I do not believe that they will have 500 fight-  ing men in the spring. They are in a vary critical situ-  ation they say they have no other way to get a living     
 f Oct 26  for their families but to war. I think it is better to let   the Army alone this winter they will die many of them   and others desert & many be weakened with the scurvey   & in the spring we will wipe them out if necessary if they   do not go away. we do all of our Business in the name of   Israel God and they in their own way. The whole matter   can be sumed up in these few words we are here at home   by our own Fireside while they are a great way from home   I intend to send those teamsters to the south whare they cannot   get Back to the Armey. I spent most of the day in the office   & with the Presidency.      October 27, 1857 ~ Tuesday      27th I spent most of the day in the office in the Afternoon G. A. Smith   A Lyman & myself spent an hour in conversing abut the war   Brother G. A. Smith said He believed their Artillery could be   taken with but little loss by rushing in the night into ther Encampment   & about 20 men to each peace put on Larrietts onto the   tongue & draw it off on horse back upon a gallop all being   mounted on good Horses & before the enemy were prepared for   defence their cannon would be leaving them      I have sown 15 Acres of wheat my boys finished Harvesting   this day      October 28, 1857 ~ Wednesday      28th President Heber C Kimball called upon us at the Historians   Office at 11 oclok & Read His History till 12 oclock then Presidents   Young & Wells A Lyman & L Snow came in & all conversed   upon the war till 2 oclok we had an express in from Box   Elder with a report that soulders [soldiers] were at Fort Hall also one   from the East saying that the Enemy had not moved for   several days but were waiting for Col Johnson to come up   with 4 companies of cavalry & 2 companies of infantry   this is report. It was decided in council that General Wells   John Taylor & Charles C Rich return to the Seat of war &   take charge of the command. The following is a synopsis of   the conversation President Young said if any officer comes   to the Armey the Govornor or Judges & send word that they   want to come in Just inform them that they are as near   as they can come Had they have come without a military   aray they could have come & not been molested but   now they cannot come we will not have any cursed   scoundrel forced upon us Jto Judge or rule over us and   they shall not Come among us. If Johnson comes   with troops & intends to come in I expect they will   leave their baggage Battery & a company to guard it and   come in on a forced march without it. Then we must   not let them sleep but use them up as soon as we can work   night and day & not let them sleep. Brother Wells thinks they   are determined to try to come in. I have sent word that if   General Harney is on the way to get into camp & kill him if   Possible and take the Animals from Johnson if Possible &  take charge of the goods train. President Young said I am   glad of one thing ie this thing will be Just as the Lord wants   it. If He wants them to come & get killed it will be so if He     
 [FIGURE]  WILFORD WOO^D^RUFF'S  JOURNAL  for  1858     
 January 1, 1858 ~ Friday      Jan 1st 1858  This is the first day of a new Year of 1858 It is a  vary plesant warm day, calm and serene, is it an omen of   peace and serenety to Zion for a year to come. time must  determin. we live in a day and generation which is big with   Events As the Church and kingdom of God advances to fulfill  its destiny it carries in its train Events, and is accomplishing  a work which is of the Deepest interes to all mankind whether  the living or the Dead who have ever tabernacled or ever will  tabernacle upon this the footstool of our God. All Prophets or Apostles  or inspired men of God who have written or spoken concerning  this Generation whether Recorded in Records revealed or sealed  have pointed out clearly the events as they have transpired   and as they will transpire before our Eyes. It has now  been over 30 years since Joseph Smith the prophet received the   gold plates from the Hand of the Angel Moroni from which He  translated the Book of Mormon And it will be 28 years the   6th day of next April since the first Branch of the Church of   Jesus Christ was organized upon the Earth containing 6 members  This little Branch of the Church like a small mustard seed has  been nourished by the hand of God through all of its difficulties  afflictions and persecutions, untill it is becoming the greatest off  all herbs according to the parable of the Saviour who refered to  it. It has continued to grow and flourish in the midst of a   strong warfare and opposition of wicked men and Devils   Untill it is growing into a kingdom in the midst of these moun-  tains and Everlasting Hills as spoken of by Daniel and other  Prophets. The Church and kingdom of God has had to wade  through a scenery of persecution oppression and Blood inflicted   upon her by the inhabitants of the United States from its first  commencement up to the present time untill many have been slain   and martered for their religion including the Prophet Joseph   who was the founder of the Church in this dispensation who was   shot in Carthage Jail with his Brother Hiram by a wicked and   hellish mob. As the Church has increased so has the opposition   increased against it untill the inhabitants of cities, towns,   counties and states rihave ^a^risen up in their wrath determined   to destroy the saints of God from off the Earth. The governors   rulers and people have all been united in this persecution and  inasmuch as the Saints of God continued to grow and thrive the   whole United States Government with President James Buca  Buchannan at there head have sent an Army of 2500 men  to lay a foundation for our destruction. The Saints of God have   prayed that the Lord would hedge up their way that they could   not come into our valley to shed our Blood or that we need not   shed their Blood and the Lord has heard the prayers of his saints  and has hedged up their way they came as far as Forts Bridger   & supply on the East side of the mountains and there have to remain   for the winter while we are still enjoying our homes and Firesides  in peace to all human appearance that Great Nation the   United States with 25000000 of souls are determined to   Expend their treasures & use their force for the Destruction   of the Church and kingdom of God from of the Earth who   are now dwelling in thes vallies of the mountains. But we trust     
 Jan 1st  in God as we have done heretofore and now look forward with  feelings of Deep interest to the Events of 1858 Believing that God   will preserve his saints and chastize his Enemies. The wicked   know not what they do "Darkness covers the Earth and gross darkness  the people." "The Heathen rage and the people imagin vain things they  say let our Eye look upon Zion and let her be defiled" "but they  know not the thoughts of the Lord neither understand they his ways"   "The Lord will have them in derision, He will laugh at their calamity & mock  when their fear cometh." Their destruction will come suddenly upon   them as a whirl wind and no power can Deliver them. The measure  which they have meeted unto the saints, and seek to bring upon them  shall be meeted unto them again as a Nation, as states, counties, towns,   cities, and families untill evry man who does not draw his sword   against his Neighbor will be oblieged to Flee to Zion for safety And   these things shall shurely come to pass for the Lord God has spoken  it. Then prepare yourself O Land of America for the judgments of  the God of Heaven await ^you^ and are nigh even at your doors For the Lord  hath looked down from his Holy habitation and hath beheld all your   wickedness and abomination and all the Evil designs of your hearts   and all your secrets plans for the destruction of the Saints of the   Most High, for all these things God will bring you into Judgment  and He will require the stewardship at the Hands of the President of   the United States and at the Hands of the senators, and Represen-  tatives, and Govornors, and Judges, and all the Rulers of the Land   will all be heald responsible for the use they make of the liberties  & blessings put into their hands and the whole people of the Land   who Elect the officers of Government will be held responsible  for the conduct of those officers as well as their own conduct   in their dealings with the church and kingdom of God upon the  Earth. Let us watch the signs of the times of 1858 And we shall   find that the Lord will soon come out of his hiding place and in  his fury he will vex the Nation and in his hot displeasure he will   begin to cut off the wicked and unjust stewards and appoint them  their portion with hypocrites and unbelievers. Let the saints of   God prepare for that which is to come      [rest of page blank]

Enoch, Elijah, and Moses, who were   translated will at some time have to pass through death because   the Law is that all men must tast of Death and the Lord does  not counteract his own laws or break them. Some are   alarmed because so many of my family are sick But I have  as good a right to be sick as any body I would not wish to   escape affliction, sickness, paine & sorrow no more than others  for if we make a right use of them they will return us  Blessings.

He said he had had a great Deal of sorrow on her   account and even had taken to drinking Brandy to overcome   the sorrow & to get sleep he had taken a half pint tumbler full   of strong Brandy when he went to bed to get sleep. President   [FIGURE] Young remarked I made up my mind years ago that I would   be governed by certain principles and among them I decreed   that women should not govern me neither should my passoins  of Lust or anger But I would be boss over myself my passions     
 Feb 15 1858  and appetites which principles I have endeavored to carry out  in my life and if all men would do it it would be a great   Blessing to them.      In speaking upon Utah affairs Brother   Wandle said that Brother Hunt Had a good deal of influence in  the Calafornia Legislature and He told them and their Senator  to Congress that He wanted them to appoint a Mormon for  Govornor but their senator said that was an impossibility for   President Buchanan had marked out his course in relation to the  Mormons and was resolved to carry it out and that was He was deter-  mined to over throw the Latter Day Saints and their institutions  let it cost what it would and the president would do nothing in   their favor and the government were determined to back him  up in this they were determined to blot out the Church govern-  ment from Utah and no power could help it. President  Young said that God had helped it so far and he would continue  to help it unto the End and they cannot Help themselves all the   people want us killed and those that wright write in our favor  among the gentile Editors are full of sin and do not wish us well   but they have a motive in view to accomplish the Lord puts that  motive in their minds yet they will not honor or serve God or  acknowledge his hand in any thing but the Lord will govern &   controll them all Just as He pleases. When Capt Van Vleit was   here He many times refered to the inexaustible overflowing treasury  of the United States and twenty five million of people and asked  if we could stand against such a Government, and when He got  back he found an Empty treasury and the Government wanting  to Borrow money I have no doubt but he thought of these things   and marvelled of it      February 16, 1858 ~ Tuesday      16th I spent a part of the day in the office I was in poor health  many are taken sick through the whole territory with a kind  of Deistemper or pestilence that almost evry one is taken with  it contains chills fever, cold & caugh it confines people to ther  Houses for 3 or 4 days then they go about again but few if any   of the saints die with it      February 17, 1858 ~ Wednesday      17 I spent most of the day in the endowment house about 60  received their endowments.

Elder Lyman picked him up near Sanber-  nadeno he was barely accompanied by one servant he comes   with dispaches from Washington to Governor Young and to   the Armey of the United States. Govornor Young called   a council of the Presidency and Twelve at his house at   7 oclok when the following Persons were present Presidents   Brigham Young Heber C Kimball and Daniel H Wells  of the Twelve Apostles Orson Hyde W. Woodruff John  Taylor A Lyman C C Rich. Also A Carrington  At 8 oclok the Messenger was introduced to us By Joseph  Angel Young as Dr Osborne which was Col T. L. Kane  He was vary formal in his introduction he was vary pale  and worn down having travelled night and day He was  seated in an easy chair. His arival was at 8 oclok He addressed   us in the following language (though he had great difficulty  in speaking.) Govornor Young and Gentlemen I come as  an ambassador from the Cheif Execative of our Nation   and am fully prepared and duly authorized to lay before     
 Feb 25  you most fully and definately the feelings and views of the citizens  of our common Country and of the feelings of the execative   towards you relating to the present position of officers of   this territory and the armey of the United States now upon yor   Borders and after giving you the most satisfactory evidences in   relation to matters concerning you now pending I shall then   call your attention and wish to enlist your sympathies in behalf   of the poor soldiers who are now suffering in the cold & snows of   the mountains and request you to render them aid and comfort  and to assist them to come here and to bid them a Hearty   welcome into your hospitable valley. Governor Young may I be   permitted to ask a private interview for a few moments with  you Gentlemen please excuse my formality for a few moments   they were about 30 minutes in secret session. they then returned   to the room & Dr Col Kane Then said that capt Van vleit   made a good report about us and used an influence to have   the Armey stop East of Bridger and had done a great deal   in our behalf you all look vary well you have built up a great   empire here in a short time. He spoke upon our prosperity wheat   Bread vegitables He was asked if Dr Bernhisel took his seat   in congress He said yes he took his seat He was opposed by the   Arkansaw members & a few others but they made fools of themselves  for if he had been refused his seat it would have been a d[e]clerat-  ion of war you have bourn your part manfully in this contest I was   pleased to see how patiently the people took it. Govornor Young asked   how the Presidents message was received the Dr said as usual in   his appointments he has been cruelly impartial. So far he has  made an excellent president. He has an Excellent cabinate they are   more united and work together better than former cabinets have   done. President Young said I suppose they are united in putting   down Utah. Col Kane said I think not. Buchanan made   one Balk in the spanish affair and in the Black warrior affair  The Cansas [Kansas] affair is not setled as yet and I hope it may grow  worse untill the people will take it in hand. In speaking of the   money pressure he said it commenced with the failure of the Ohio   Life insureance and trust company and then the Banks and   other firms followed in their turn. Col Kane said I wish you   knew how much I feel at home I hope I shall have the privilege   of Breaking bread with these my friends. Gov Young said I   want to take good care of you. I want to tell you one thing and   that is the men you see here do not look old and the reason   is they are doing right and are in the service of God and   if men would do right they might live to a great age. there  is but few men in the world that have the great amount of   Labure to do which I have I have to meet men evry hour in   the day. I stand in the streets and do more business in an hour   than Any president, King or Emperor has to perform in a day  I have to think for the people constantly. I think that   you can endure more now than you could 10 years ago. if you   had done as some men have you would now have been in your  grave before now. Col Kane said that I fear that I can  endure more than I could 10 years ago for I feel that my life dont   pay and I feel like going away as soon as it is the will of God to take me     
 Feb 25  President Young remarked I know to take this life as it is   and as men make it it does not appear worth living in   but I well tell you that when you see things as they are  you will find life is worth preserving and blessings will follow   our living in this life if we do right. Now if God should   say I will let you live in this world without any pain or  sorrow we might feel life was worth living for but  this is not in the economy of God. we have to partake   of sorrow affliction sorrow and death and if we pass   throug through this affliction patiently and do right   we shall have a greater reward in the world to come  I have been rob[b]ed several times of my all in this life   and my property has gone into the hands of my Enemies   but as to property I care no more about it than about   the dirt in the streets ownly to use it as God wishes it  But I think a great deal of a friend a true friend   an honest man is the noblest work of God and to live   in such a society is a great Blessing but we shall live   to enjoy that privilege. It is not in the power of the United   States to destroy this people for they are in the hands of God   and so are we and he will do with us as he pleases and   if he does right God will preserve us. The Lord does   many things which we would count as small things.  A poor man came into my office I felt by the spirit  that He kneeded five dollars in money. I took it out   of my pocket and gave it to him I soon after found a   five dollar gold peace in my pocket which I did not put   there. I soon found another this was put in my pocket by  the Lord or some agent. many think that the Lord has nothing  to do with gold but he has charge of that as well as any other  element. Brother Kimball said in Nauvoo if we had to leave  our Houses let then go we will go to the mountains and in a few   years we will have a better City than we have here, this is  fulfilled. He also said we will have gold and coin twenty   dollars peaces and we came here formed a city and  coined the first twenty dollars peices in the United States  and seeing the brethren poorly clad He said it would not   be three years before we could by clothing cheaper in salt  Lake valley and before the time was out the gold digers  brought loads of clothing and sold them in our city at   quarter price. He then said Brother Thomas the Lord sent   you here and he will not let you die No you cannot die  till your work is done. I want to have your name live with  the Saints to all Eternity you have done a great work and you   will do a greater work still. we then parted and went to our homes      February 26, 1858 ~ Friday      26 I spent the day in the office Journalizing I had a social   sit down in my hous with G. A. Smith A Lyman pOrson Pratt   and A. O. Smoot      February 27, 1858 ~ Saturday      27th I called upon Col Kane Mrs Woodruff also he received  us cordially soon G. A. Smith came in we spent several hours   conversing together talked over old times spoke of government

At the close of our interview we called upon President Young  He spoke of his interview with Col Kane last evening, and  He learned the following fiact in relation to his visit to us in   1846. That Maj Mitchel reported to President Polk that the   Mormons were receiving large sums of Money from the British  Government and they were conniving with the indians against the   government But it was not Generally believed and some said we   were a poor persecuted people and ought to be helped instead   of being persecuted and it was proposed to give us a part of   Kansas Territory which would have been done had it not have   been for secretary Marey he said he would resign if it was done   and finally when it was known that General Carney was friendly   to us he was sent off and when Col Allen was appointed to   take charge of the Mormon Battalion and he became our friend  the Doctors killed him Col Kane was sent out by the president   to know the truth concerning us as a people and make a true   report of it which he accomplished and done us good.

Mr Cooper replyed that Mr Kenny   did not believe in that system. President Young said the   United States are determined to lay their hands upon all   that country. Mr Cooper said their is a treaty with  England and the U.S. that Neither party can take   possession of that country. B. Young said they care no  more about any treaty than a Horse does a spiders web   in his way to his feed they will break any treaty they  please when they have the power. Now if you have   any Proposals to make we will ^hear^ them. Mr Cooper said   we would like to hear your proposals. B Young said I   have no proposals to Make Mr Kinnays rights & titles   were discused B Young said as far as I am conserned   I will say that if Mr Kenny owned all that country &   Mexico and would give me the whole of it I would not go   there their would not but vary few from the Northern   Country that would live their J. V. Cooper thinks that we  underrate the climate. The Letters were read of introduction  G. A. Smith said by the time we have got theire and spent  several years in improving the country there they would  pour in by thousands and take what we have. Mr Cooper   said I look at treaties different from what you do for  upon that principle we could have no confidence in any  Nations. B Young said Bless your soul I have more confidence     
 May 24  In the governments than they have all they have   care about it is they want to get power & they will  use it. what do the United States care about the Constitution   Houper said, they are doing away with the Constitution   as fast as they can, their is no people in the Nation   that keep the Law as well as this people then what business   had they to send armies here None at all ownly because   they have the power but they will also want some power   to maintain their armies when they get here Mr Cooper  said that He thought the Filbustering was at an end in that   country President Young asked if Mr HCooper was acquainted  with the political beat of the puls of the Government of the  United States He said he had observed a good Deal B Young   said they are intending to annex all North & South   America as fast as they get the power Mr Cooper   said the Country was ^as^ healthy as this it contains the   Mountains Rolling, & bottom lands there is the a great amount of logwood, rosewood and all kinds of woods and   fruits that grow in that climate. sugar cane indigo and   all kinds of fruits grow spontaineously B. Y. said that  the US was so greedy to get territory they would soon   burst up & ruin themselves. Mr Kinny sympathizes   with us in our war but we have no war with any body  the United States are making war upon a little handful   of men they may make war as long as they please and  if they drive us hard enough we will show them fun  and their has not been a more imbecil Government   on Earth than President Buchanan has manifested during  his administration if hise had set in his Chair and said   not a word but remained as a monument and employed  a Boy 10 years old to have done his his business he would have  manifested more wisdom than he has done. If you have   any propisition to make to me I wish you to do it itn writing   but with a strict understanding that none of us will ever   go to that country, if we occupy that country we will do it   with people from other country, they said they would make   their proposition in writing these remarks are ownly a   sketch of the Conversations which passed. The men returned  Then the speech of General Houston in the senate of the  United States was then read He defended the rights of the mor-  mons and dare speak the truth, and he is the ownly man in   the senate that dare stand up and defended the rights of the   Inhabitants of Utah. The subject came up relatives to   the war, Edleex Williams said give me 50 men and I   will meet 10,000 men, and stop all and if one gets in  I will never come back A Lyman said take poisioned   Arrows and shoot the stock and shoot at the stock & not   the men all the time President Young said if it is the volun-  teers that come here they come on purpose to kill the  Mormons and I should be in for killing them as fast as we   have a chance. President Young told Mr J. B Cooper   & James M. Harbin when they get to Calafornia to tell   the people who seek our destruction that we ask no odds     
 May 24th  of theyem they will yet see the day when they will  asx aid and assistance at my hands. I spent the  evening at the office and wrote a Letter to Mrs. W.       May 25, 1858 ~ Tuesday      25th I spent the day in the office upon my history  President Young spent the fore part of the day in  the office. while speaking of Col Kane President Young   said Col Kane did say to President Buchannan that   he owed Gov Young an apology for sending an army  to Utah in the way he did and persuing the course   he had towards the people of that territory and He   should make that apology to Gov Young for President  Buchannan and he was an agent sufficient to do   it. we will never bow down to their opression we will   not have a mock trial over us we will sooner apply   to the mountains and then to the rifle, before we will   do it. Col Kane is as good a Lawyier as we will find  abroad and he sustained us in our course and said   that it was the cream of creams. you have taken   the right course and I want to have you keep in  the right. I would not have you had you taken any  other course for nothing. President Young said   this is the reason why we have let the army alone  Col Kane said I have feared all the time that   you would chew that whole Armey up.      President Young said Gen Houston had it right when  he said if you make war upon them you will get   awfully whiped. But President Young said Buchanan   is determined that it shall be war and Nothing   but war He wished to be President now or never   exspected to be. while speaking upon the subject of  treason and being tried for treason, He said to  Hosea Stout I want to have you get all the testimony  upon that subject you can to gether in the defence  I should show that I as the Governor of this Territ[or]y   had a right to resist an armed force entering into   this Territory In as much as the President of the  United States gave me no notice of sending an army   to this Territory or of removing me from office then  show that the President of the United States had no right  to make war upon any states or Territory upon   mere rumour untill investigating the subject  Now for the President to make use of the language  he did in that Early stage to empl[o]y spies what use  had they for spies when their was No war, poor  Devils they laid a plan to make war upon the people   and not to make peace.      Brother Box and Allen called in to report what they  found in researches they saw they found good grass   on the mountains but no water for stocks but in   places snow was 15 feet deep, they found one pocket   large enough to hide all the people in Provo      President Young said I will not be tried in a court by   our Enemies while under their power it will be     
 May 25  Settelled either amicably or by the rifle. President   Young sent a Letter to Gen D. H. Wells. A company of   Apostates left for the enemies camp an man on   guard at Echo Canyon left his post and went into   the apostate camp President Young said give him a   pass and let him go with our enemies. In the   after noon with G. A. Smith I visited President   Young at his house he wished me to buy a place near  his place as we should move the Historian office  near him. He soon called at the Historians office   with a proposition to sell us 30000000 acres of land  in the Musketoe Country for 10 cts per acre one third  to be paid down when we take possession of the   country & the remander to be in instalments annually  with 10 per cts interest all to be paid within 10 years  the President refused to purchase & wrote an answer  accordingly G. A. Smith read an account of central America      May 26, 1858 ~ Wednesday      26th I spent the morning in the office on my history at  half past 10 an express arived to Gov Young by Barlow we  wente to see President Young met him coming to the office  in his carriage he brought us down to the Historian office  we met in the Office viz president Young G.

President Young said I can read  them just as easy      The paper reports that the London  times sends out a correspondence with the army also the   Herrald and times were sending out writers they are  sending out some 8000 men or preparing to send them  the paper also inform us that two peace commissioners will be  sent to Utah {President Young says that if Bovier comes in he ought to be put under the sod.} Several   peaces were read from the paper. I received a letter from  C. W. Wandle. I wrote a Letter to him in reply. President Young   [FIGURES] and G A. Smith Rode out and returned to the office  in the afternon. Mr Cooper called also, and said that  he was in the Musketoe country 9 months and that he found   it a good country and would rather live theire than to   in any other country. President Young said to Mr Cooper   what could Mr Kenny mean or think of us to send   to us as he has, does he think we are fools? The United States  would give millions of dollars to have us go to that country   for then they could lay their hands upon us. I would not go   to that country if it was covered 15 inches deep with gold   and we owned it all. we are here and here we will stay   in this Territory. He conversed one hour upon our faith     
 May 26  policy and intentions. He said that President Buchanan was  not a man to plan or lay wires or chalk out the way for  the prosperity of the Nation. If the whole Nation was   boiled down into one man and he possessed the knowledge  of the whole I could teach him the principle of Law and  Government for I know more than the whole of them      President Buchanan has manifested the greatest folly of  in his official acts of any man that ever occupied the   Presidential chair. I know ^w^hat the United States wish   to do with us they wish to kill us but they [will] not accomplish  their design if they drive us to far then wo be unto them  they will soon go to peaces. we had a hard rainy night      May 27, 1858 ~ Thursday      27th I spent most of the day in the office.

Soon Mr John   Hartnett tSecretary came in was introduced to President   Young & company it was the first time they had met.  The following is a synopsis of the conversation that passed   between them Col Allexander called yesterday & had a short   interview and it was vary agreeable. President Young said     
 Aug 9th  I was much pleased with him and am satisfyed that   if he had the sole command of the Armey & I could have   had three hours conversation with him all would have   been right and they could have come in last fall as   well as now. President Young asked Hartney how he   liked the place. He said well ownly I dont like to go   to Parawan to attend to the Legislature. It will be a   pleasant ride for you through the snow. I had a plenty of   that last winter. I went back to the states through the   snow. I have been confined some 10 years years in   the merchantile business and it was into[o] close confine-  ment for my health the Journey to this country was   an inducement for me to come that I might have   more exercise. Mr Hartnett asked if our difficulties   were not all setteled. B Y yes so far as they can be   as far as I know. I have been driven 5 times from   my house and home without any Just cause, this time I   did not wish to be driven. The President of the United   States has given us a good deal of Trouble, Buchanan  sent an armey to us & stoped all communication   with ^us^ by stoping the Mail then laid a plan for our destruction  Hartney said I did not understand it so. B. Y said what   did you suppose they sent an armey for. He said to   guard the trains and protects the people against the Indi-  ans &c, did you not believe that we had burned the   court Records & broaken the United States Laws. He   Answered I did, This was all fals, we have never   opposed any good men who were attending to their   own business but I have alway taken the Liberty to speak   my mind freely upon any subject or the acts of wicked   men who would act outrageous. Hartney said that He   did not think that president Buchanan intended to   have the army fight. He told me when he found   that there was to be war that He was not willing to   have any Blood shed untill He had sent out Peace Commission-  ers sent to the people & try ^to^ make peace President asked   why did he stop the Mail without any cause, they have   stoped the mail several times when they were about   to commence a persecution upon us they did it in   Nauvoo. President Polk sent an Agent to demand   500 men of us in the wilderness & made arangements   to have us destroyed if we did not comply. Gov Bogs   Agent told me that the mormons were the best people   He ever saw and if they would mingle with the people   and do as we do all would be well but we did not feel   disposed to do it and we were driven out of the state   because of our religion, this Armey boasted all the   while that they would kill our Edlders & take the women   & do what they pleased with them. Hartney said   I came with the army & did not hear such language   as your people say was among them. No they would   not say before you what they would among themselves   I want the United States to let us alone & let us mind   our own business & keep the Laws of God & the Constitution     
 Aug 9th  of the United States as we always have done then   our difficulties will be settelled as far as they can  be but this people will not be driven from these   mountains we shall fight first. we do take the   liberty to speak of the acts of men when they debase  themselves by their acts, but this People hold the  Constitution of the United States sacred. Now should   I speak about Judge Eckles who came & spent the   winter in Green River Country & hadd a mob mo[ck]  court before he took the oath of office & brought in   Bills of Indictment against thousands of citizens   who were innocent of crime Now if I was   to speak about his acts they would accuse me  of speaking against the Constitution of the United   States & say I was guilty of treason No man   can Justly find any fault with any of my   official acts except the stoping of those trains   and that I done to save the sheding of Blood      August 10, 1858 ~ Tuesday      10th I called at the office in the Afternoon called   upon President Young in the evening with Brother  Wheelock & spoke to the president about Holding   publick meetings on the business of the Agricultural  Society He did not wish meetings called upon  any subject. H C Kimball went with me to   the Historians office He said the Judgments of   God would follow the Nations as the gospel had   gone we should have good peace for two years  what would follow time must determine      August 11, 1858 ~ Wednesday      11th I spent the day in the office attended the   prayer circle at 6 oclok      August 12, 1858 ~ Thursday      12th I spent most of the day in the office Reading   history I called upon President Young. He was   soon visited by Secretary Hartney and  several Military officers who were introduced to   President Young & the company present they conversed  upon a variety of subjects such as the weather, wood   water, coal, Roads, the production of  the srinkage of the  wood snow, destination of the Armey, &c &c H C   Kimball & A Carrington came in was introduced  the names of the men were capt Bryan, Lieut Bristol   Lieut Rich, Lieut Kensel      August 13, 1858 ~ Friday      13 I spent most of the day in the office on history I called   upon President Young. Brother Kimball was present  He President Young was talking to John Clawson upon   the subject of making powder he told him he could  make it as well as not we can get salt Peter in   abundance here He told him to go to work & make it &  to make soap.      he said he had read my history   twice & must read it again      August 14, 1858 ~ Saturday      14 I spent a part of the day in the Historians office &   a part in President Youngs office He went up City Creek Canyon     
 August 15, 1858 ~ Sunday      Aug 15  Sunday I spent most of the day in the presidents office   in looking over the papers & listening to their conversation  H C Kimball Joseph Young & several others were  in soon Harvey Whitlock and came in when the   conversation turned upon a variety of subjects  Harvy Whitlock is a Doctor of the old school  President Young said that good and bad men   will act out what is in them But God controlls all   the acts of men. When Col Kane came to visit us  He tried to point out a line of Policy for me to persue   but I told him I should not turn to the right or left   or persue any course ownly as God dictated me I  should do nothing ownly what was right and when   he found that I would not be influenced ownly as  the spirit of the Lord led me he felt discouraged &  said he would not go to the armey But He finally said  if I would dictate he would execute I told him   as he had been inspired to come here he should   go to the armey and do as the spirit led him to do   and all would be right and he did so and all  was right. He thought [it] vary strange because we were  not afraid of the armey I told him we were not afraid   of all the world if they made war upon us the Lord  was able to deliver us out of their hands and   would do it if we did right. God controlls all   of these matters. Now when the armey was coming  here there were many Indians who come here  and wanted to fight the soldiers I would not  Empl[o]y them this made many of them mad  and they Joined the soldiers and wanted to  fight us. If they had commenced war against  the United States it would have been a general   war they would have destroyed the western   cities. Br Kimball said that Col Kane asked  what would be the result of he spoke against   the Mormons Brother Kimball told him his   mind would become Barren and he could   not do any good but would droop & die away but   as long as you will stand up for the truth you will   be fruitful and feel well. Elder Kimball said  that the day would come when our boys who are  now riding around the street will be inspired to do  some of the greatest things you ever heard of the  subject of the three Esstates was spoken off Br   Kimball said that he believed that those who were  valiant in the first esstate would be in this & would  be crowned in glory in the next the day is at  hand when things will be done here on Earth  as it is done in heaven then Enoch will come   and fall upon our necks & we upon his & we   shall kiss each other. The subject of the church   farm came up President Young said I want the  farm to accomodate me more than it ever has     
 Aug 15  done for I have furnished all upon that farm except   the making of the fence & the Church has charged me   with thousands of Dollars for eggs Butter & various   things from that farm which belonged to me      I attended the prayer circle with the 12 at Brother  Bensons. I opened by Prayer & E. T. Benson was mouth      August 16, 1858 ~ Monday      16th I spent the fore part of the day wattering Garden   & cutting up Courant Bushes & the afternoon in  the office I called upon President Young he was  vary cheerful. Brother Kimball had a dream which  He told he dreamed the City was full of Hogs who appeared   mad they were foaming & frothing at the mouth they   tried to bite him but he found their mouths was tied   up and they could not bite he got up onto a wall to   get away from them & when he come to look  aroungd to see whare they were and he could not   see one in the city they had all gone away vary   suddenly. Furguson said that forty men went out  under Lieut Lee to chastize the Indians from   Fort Bridger President Young said the Indians   will ketch it yet I want Enmity put between the   wicked & the wicked.

Brother Baker had Quarrels   with wihis wives & children almost daily & Ann   was about to leave him but before she left Baker  had some words with her and then he beat her   on each side of her head with the flat side of  his hand untill the Blood run out of her ears and   one Eye was vary black. She gave her testimony   about the whole affair she said he struck her as  though he was going to knock down an ox he struck  her about 10 times on the side of the head in telling the  story they talked back and forth & made cross statements  Betsey was then called upon to give her statement but  she did not wish to talk Her Father James Staples  told his daughters to tell the truth without any regard to  any body and said she had entered many complaints   to him against Baker and if she now would not tell   the truth & tell the thing as it is he did not wish to   have her come home hereafter with a tale of wo,  but she would not talk much President Young then   said Betsey I want you to tell the truth and not keep  any thing back. you will be wanting a Bill [of divorce] by   & By from Baker & if you dont tell the story now  I dont want you to come hereafter with a tale of  sorrow still she did not feel light like talking.

But as she would     
 Aug 21  not talk Brother Baker was kalled upon to tell his story   which was some what lengthy he acknowledged  whiping his wife but said he was not mad but timed   his blows according to the strength of her head, said  he was willing to abide by the decission of the council  President Young said that if this woman was subject   to desease these blows would probably cost her her life  If he had have treated me in this way I would have   cut his throat, and there is many women who would   have done it. I would not trust a dog with Brother   Baker or put one in his care for he does not know how  to treat either man or beast. I have women in my family  that would have killed Brother Baker in a momen[t] if he   had treated them in the way he has Ann. But I govern  my family by kind ness I tell them what is right  & I get them to obey me without whiping them If I can-  not get my family to do as I wish them without Quarrel-  ing with them I will not say a word about it.   President Young said to Baker Betsey will come to me   for a Bill [of divorce] if you do not ctake a Different coursce  and she will have a long hard story to tell.

A man   that was a Mormon was shot with 3 balls on dry creek   for his money. the murderer is still at large. I called   upon President Young & spent the afternoon with him and   H C Kimball D H Wells A Carrington G A Smith &   others Brothers Jeremiah Hatch & William Miles arived   from Sanpete with word from Arrowpeen He says  that it was Tamoke a young Indian the son of Uinta   who killed Brother Brown then Brother Josiah Call shot   Tamoke through the hips who has since died the indians   followed Brother Call & shot him. The Indians said they did   not wish us to be mad about it. Arrowpeen wished to know if   [FIGURE] he must shake hands with the armey he says that all  the Indians want to fight with the army for they have killed   one of our best men & the Indians are mad, and they are   gathering together to fight & Arrowpeen wants to fight   & he will not be controlled by any man but Brigham   Young. They say that Mr Hurt the Indian Agent & other   officers have told them that the United States Armey have   concocked a plan to send all their teamsters among the   Mormons & to distribute the soldiers among the Mormons   and when the snows fall to Block up the canyons they   will fall upon the Mormons & kill Brigham Young his   councellors The Twelve and all the Chiefs of the Mormons in   all this Territory and if the mormons would not fight now  they will fight when their Blood mingles with the Blood   of the Indians and the indians want to go to war they   all acknowledge Arrowpeen as their Chief & he will fight   unless Brigham Stops him. All the tribes in this region   will come together hold a council & Join in the war. He   says the ^Sanpitch [Peobawah] Piedes, ^parvantes^ Utahs, Shushonies, & Navahoes   will all Join together to fight the soldiers, this is what   they want. They say that men appear to them in their   Meetings come up out of the ground & talk to them & tell   them they must not kill the mormons for the mormons   are good & will soon be one with the mormons Indians   the persons wh[o]appear to the Indians say they are theirs   Brother they said one man had a red pistol & if he shot it   it would blow the mountain to peaces. The Indians said that   Judjge Eckels had advised Col Johnson to place a part of the   armey at Bridger a part at Cedar valley & some south   so that when they make an attack upon the Mormons they   could kill them & thougy [they] could not get out of the valley     
 Oct 31  Col Johnson has done as Judge Eckles advised   him this its the Indians Statement President   Young wrote a Letter to Arrowpene by Brother   Hatch & told him it was not good to shed blood   This places President Young in a vary singular   position while President Buchannan with the congress   and Armies of the United States are all laying plans   to take the Life of President Young and the Indian   Agents are trying to stir up the Indians to kill him   then when the Indians turn round & wish to fight   the United States President Young through his influ-  ence has to hold back the instruments of Death from   killing the vary men who are seeking his own life   but the Lord will reward him for his patience, long  suffering & forbearance & he will also reward all his   enemies. President Young said he believed this war   cloud would blow over the time would come when these   things would come to pass but he was satisfied the time   was not know. Arrowpeen said that Forney was   a Fool that he had a small heart but it was as black   as night. President Young had a great heart & it   was as white as snow. when the Lords time come   for war the Indians will not feel like holding back   neither shall I but that time has not come now   I met with the Twelve in the prayer circle Brother   C C Rich opened by Prayer F. D. Richards was mouth   in the circle we consecrated a Bottol of oil      November 1, 1858 ~ Monday      Nov 1st I spent the day in the office Journalizing   Brother Hatch called into the office & gave an   Account of the procedings of Dr Forney he seems vary   penurious allthough Government has put into his hands   a large amount of money to defray the Indian Expenses   far more than they have ever put into the Hands of   Govornor Young & yet Dr Forney wants the Mormons   to feed all the Indians as they have done for   ten years without any pay so that he can pocket   the money as many of the Government officials do   & the whole Nation is wicked & corrupt from the   President down throug every department of the   Government their never was a wickeder Generation  on the earth than the present one they are ripe for   the Damnation of Hell and righteously deserve   the wrath & indignation of Almighty God      November 2, 1858 ~ Tuesday      2nd I covered up my Grape vines and went to   the office. President Young said while speaking of   the Indian war that it was better for us not to fight   them but feed them well treat them kindly & they   would kill far less of our people & die much   Faster themselves than they would to fight them   & drive them to subsist upon their former living   upon roots & herbs     
 Nov 2nd  I felt impressed during the evening to go Presidents Youngs  I called upon him & spent the evening with him & D H  Wells O. Hyde G. A. Smith John Taylor A Lyman      I did not know that the Twelve were going to meet  there Elders O Hyde & John Taylor gave an account  of their mission North. They went to Farmington & preached   to the people They sharply reproved Brother Brownell for  Fault finding & sowing evil through the place against Bishop  Hess & others. Brother Brownell was vary stubborn & it  was finally dicided to cut him off from the Church if He  did not make confession next Sabbath the whole branch  voted for this measure. Brownell called upon Brother   Wells to get council upon it Brother Wells told him it   would do him no hurt to humble himself & make a confes-  sion as he was required. President Young said I have  often thought of the words of Solomon that a wise child  was Better than an old and foolish king I could pick  out many Boys in this Church 16 years old more fit  for Bishops than many old men who are Bishops there  are but few men who seem calculated to make Bishops  The Brethren then went to Willow Creek to settle a  Difficulty with Elder A Cordon the President & Bishop  Dives there were three or Four charges brought against  Brother Cordon but when they were all investigated they  did not amount to any thing as a fault all the Branch   voted to sustain him as President the Bishops councellor  for the men who accused him four of his accusers were   cut off from the Church. The people did not like to vote  for Bishop Dives unless he would go by the council given  him He had it was said that the Bishop had a watch which  he carried that was tithing property & a cow they had milked  all summer & No credit given on the tithing Books &c  these matters were not much investigated. President   Young said the Twelve should look into all such matters  & regulate them. He asked if they saw any body there  that would make a Bishop they said No without it  was Elder Cordon. O Hyde thought He knew much  more than Bishop Dives. President Young said He  is not calculated for a Bishop He is a good man for  a President and in spiritual things But was not calcu-  lated for a Bishop. Their is anoth[er] thing Lorenzo Snow  presides over that region & is a prudent wise man yet he  has strong pregudices & does not pull on the same strings that  I do there has been a kind of a spirit to keep Dives  Down But I believe if he had had the sole controll of   things there as the president opened the meetings & preached  to the people He would have made a good smart preacher  But I never saw the man that was kept down by his  superiors that could rise above it John Taylor asked  who is the greatest the President or the Bishop. President   Young said the Bishop should attend to his own business  & let the Presidents alone & the Presidents should attend  to his Business & let the Bishops alone, but they should     
 Nov 2nd  The President should say to the Bishop can I do   any thing for you & the Bishop should say to the President  can I do any thing for you & they should mutually  help each other. President Young asked can a Bishop   try a President Answered yes. can a President try  a Bishop John Taylor thought there might be cases   whare a President Might try a Bishop President Young  said A Bishop Might try an Apostle & cut him off  whare he committed any outrageous Act in his ward  G A Smith said a Teacher might do the same as far as  his authority went But of course he could Appeal  President Young said a man cut himself off or on just  as he pleased by his own acts. But any one of the Twelve  while officiating in his office in any part of the world  are the Presidency of the Church the same as we are  at home their power is the same as ours & they should  investigate & regulate all matters appertaining to the  Church, without any regard to whatever instruction  they may have received      November 3, 1858 ~ Wednesday      3rd I spent the day at home covering vines &c till  2 oclk & the rest of the day at the office      November 4, 1858 ~ Thursday      4th I spent the day compiling History I planted some  peach stones, Apricotts & Plums & Currants in the  morning I spent the evening with President Young  D H. Wells G. A. Smith A Lyman J. Cummings B  Stringham & Lewis Robinson. President Young asked  me if I would go to Filmore I told him yes President  Young [FIGURE] said one of his Boys stuck a nail through his  foot He took the nail greased it & carried it in his  pocket & kept it warm wraped in a pece of paper then  put on a peace of salt pork on the wound & it soon   healed up this is always his remidy and he says he  has never known it to fail this is worth remembering  I spent the time at home making out accounts from  9 oclok till 2 in the morning.      November 5, 1858 ~ Friday      5th I spent the day on History      November 6, 1858 ~ Saturday      6th I spent the fore part of the day on History the  afternoon I spent at home I made a family Party  in connexion with A.

President Young said not [to] put it  in History But copy it in a Book & seal it up stating   on the outside of it what it is & let it lie untill we  want it it may be 20 years hence He said President  Polk was at the Bottom of it and Poke wanted to give   the Mormons a grant of Land some whare in the west  But secretary Marcy opposed him strongly & said if  he did He would resign & do all he could against  him. There was a strong opposition against the Saints  & Thomas Benton had prepared an Armey to destroy  the saints in the wilderness & Nothing saved us ownly  our fitting out the Mormon Battalion to go to Mexico  at the call of the Government      It was reported that Peter Conover was drunk in a  store & nearly crazy. Hopkins Pendor a Polieceman   went in to take him when some of his friends said they   would take care of him He said that was all he wanted   was to have him taking care of, as he was leaving the  store Calvin Foss came to him and asked him if he  was the man that chased him the other night (as two   men were chased who had taken away a mans wife & daughter  for the purpose of whoredom & was shot at while in their  flight) He answered yes. Foss then said dam you I will   shoot you if you ever follow me again you just try it again  & I will use you up. Hopkins Fendor went into the street  & told the Mayor of [it] he asked him why he did not knock  him down He said why did you not go into the street & get   help the remark was made that He ought to be taken up  {President Young} one said I would not take him up if he was to threaten  my life in that way. Brother James Ida called upon  President Young for council to go to Calafornia to settle his  busines President Young advised him to remain & appoint some  men there to settle it this Brother Ida raised a large crop of wheat  for the saints in Calafornia

President Young had told them if they  wanted to make good fish oil make a vat or big tub   set it in the sun & throw in all the heads & guts & let  them lie & rot and stink & they will all turn to oil  you can put a little water in the Bottom to keep the  oil from drying      November 10, 1858 ~ Wednesday      10th I spent the day in the office on history I called upon   Wm Kimball in the evening about Lumber I found him in  Bed.

President Kimble spoke in the   morning followed by O. Hyde W. Woodruff President Brigham     
 Nov 13  Young then addressed the People for the first time since the  Armey of the United States had entered our valley he gave  much good teaching instruction & reproof      in the Afternoon Joseph Young spoke followed by O Hyde then  Members were cut off from the Church      I met in the evening at President Young with the Legislature  an arangement was made by the members to assemble at the social  Hall on the 2nd Monday in Dec & organize & adjourn to Fillmore this  was done to sustain our own acts then at Fillmore we would organ-  ize to Accomodate Gov Cummings as he considered that the Seat of   Government then we would adjourn back to Great Salt Lake City  to spend the session to accomodate all parties. Gov Cummings thought   our adjournment to Great Salt Lake City was illegal because it was  done by a Joint resolution of both Houses in Joint Session he considered  it not of the same validity as an act in separate houses he was informed  that several of the states in the Union was received & admitted into  the Union by a Joint vote of both Houses of Congress and we establi-  shed the seat of Government at Filmore by a Joint resolution of both  houses & if our removal of the seat of Government to Great Salt   Lake City was not legal then the esstablishment of the seat of  Government at Filmore was not legal Hence we have no seat of  Government. It is a singular argument of Gov Cummings   that the unanimous vote of the two houses in Joint session  weakens the power of Legislation & is not of the same force   & validity that it would be if passed in separate Houses  such an argument contains neither force or power      November 14, 1858 ~ Sunday      14th Sunday The conference met at 10 oclok. President  Wells spoke after President Kimball, & He was followed  by President Young who reproved the Elders sharply in  the power of God for the evils which exhisted among them  the conference then cut off from the Church by a  unanimous vote [blank] members and on saturday they  cut off [blank] Members making a total of [blank]  they were cut of for Aposticy, drunkenness, lying, swareing  whoredoms &c. President Young again spoke & asked if they   supposed all was cut off that should be I tell you no if all  shoud be cut off that ought to be there would be many more   than there is to day He said that any man that wilfully sined and   broke the Law of God ought to be cut off men may do wrong & sin  wilfully with there Eyes Can I forgive them I will if God   will but he will require the penalty to be paid I will forgive   men for singing ignorantly.

 Nov 16  Nov 12. friday night I met with President Young G A. Smith  O. Hyde E. T. Benson & Elder Wall & A. J. Stewart President Young   in speaking of the 3 men that was cut off from the Church  Chesley & James Phelps and anoth[er] He hoped they would not  come back for they were a stink in any place. James Phelps   will steal & Get Drunk. William Hickman had his Horse  stolen in the streets to day with saddle & Bridle He was offered  $500 for him in the morning the thieves are getting vary   bold in this City they are stealing horses in our streets in   open day & waggons out of the yard by night. Brother Wall   related a circumstance of an officer of the Armey who ask   him if he was a Mormon yes, I supose you are an out & in  mormon Just as it suits you? I am a thorough mormon I believe   in all their principles. What poligamy and all? Yes, How  many wives have you? I have three & Twelve children.   How do you suppose those children will look upon you when   they get Groan up? I will tell you how they will look upon   me they will point to me & say theire is my Father   who has raised me fed, clothed, & Educated me and owned  me through persecution oppression & scorn and I will   own honor & obey him, while your children at Fort  Levensworths St Louis & all places whare you have been   which you will not own nor provide for they will not  own you & their mothers will point to you as they see you  pass & will say there is your father but dont say a word   about it for the world those children will both Hate &   despise you & the vary Ground upon which you tread  Capt Wolf replied scratching his head By ... that is  true but I never looked upon it in that light "What  would you do if the Government should give orders to put   you to death if you did not put away your wives? I would  take my wives & wives children & go to some secluded spot  of Earth whare I could enjoy my wives & children & liberty  "What if the Government should pounce onto you & not give you the  privilege? then I would take my family into the mountains  & I would fight you over evry hill & dale as long as I lived      Capt Woolf replyed I will not shoot at you. Capt  Woolf said Governor Young ought to be the next President  for He is the smartest man in the United States He has   been playing a game of Ucre [Euchre] with the United States and   has beat them, he had gained five points while the  United States has ownly had a march & he ought to be   president & I would vote for him.      The man who was   a waggon master of the train which Lot Smith burned   said Capt Smith & his men were Gentlemen it was the  best thing for me & your people that could have been done  it released me & sent me back to the states or I should   have suffered with the rest in the mountains and it was well   for the mormons for if this train had not been burned the Armey  would probably have pushed on had a fight & blood been spiled  The Gentiles have undertaken to build a City on Provo Bench  Wall offered to take the water out for $200000. President Young  thought they would do not much in it.

He says he can herd 200 sheep & 200 goats  together & drive them to any place easier than he can 100 sheep  alone as he can drive goats to any point of compass & the sheep   will follow Buck sheep will mix with Goats which does  not injure the meat But Buck Goats will never serve a   sheep when a she goat produces a Buck land [lamb] [gendered]  by a Buck sheep they have two pair of horns, but it  is not often they mix in this way. A she goat will give  from one pint to 3 pints to milking      November 19, 1858 ~ Friday      19th G A Smith went to Provo I spent the day separating  scraps of 1858 I spent the evening with President Young  Brother E. Snow G D Watt & Tinney were present      November 20, 1858 ~ Saturday      20th I spent the day separating scraps it snowed mostly   through the day I called upon President Young in the   evening at 9 oclok. I conversed with him upon  the Deseret Alphabet all our former manuscript was  lost and he wished me to Join Elder G. D. Watt in making   out an other at 4 cl 5 oclok P Dodson came to serve     
 Nov 20th  A writ upon Brigham Young sen Brigham Young jr Joseph  A Young, Hiram Clawson, & James Ferguson at hal      President Young sent word for him to leave a copy &  He would acknowledge the serving of the writ at half past   5. One Gilbert came again to serve the same writs & was   Determined to go in but they did not let him but acknowledged  the writ. The Gentiles are trying to make a Fuss   with the Saints in this place But God will controll the matter  this puts me in mind of my dream last winter that the   Armey came in & I was taken three times with warr[an]ts  I herd President Young acknowledge the servece of the  writ. This writ was issued upon a complaint that President   Young had taken the property of Mr Burr which he left  He was sewed in the sum of $3000. I remained till near  9 oclok.      November 21, 1858 ~ Sunday      21st Sunday I met with my Quorum at 12 oclok for prayer  A. O. Smoot Prayed & E F Sheets was mouth. The Eastern   Mail arived this morning report some 18 inches of snow  on the mountains their was not much News by the mail  the state Elections show that the North was going against the   President & his measures. I met with the Twelve at 6 oclok   in the Prayer Circle. After which we called upon the   President Brigham Young viz O Pratt W Woodruff  John Taylor, E. T. Benson & Erastus Snow of the Twelve  & D. H. Wells & G D Grant, we spent the evening till   9 oclok the conversation was upon the subject of the court  to morrow mostly & the spirit of the Gentiles. President  Young said Gov Cummings was much opposed to the course   that Burr & Judge St Clair is taking in this matter  President Young has turned the property over to Gov  Cummings a long time ago      I went home & administered to my child Hiram Smith   who was taken sick on Friday & has now a severe attack  of the Quinsey & vary dangerous this is Emma's child  Mrs Woodruff Sister Smoot & Smith set up with it  mostly through the night it was vary sick they gave   it Lobelia & oil & molasses & relieved the lungs & a fever   seemed to settle in the Head. we administered to it several   times & it seemed to get some relief we prayed for it   in the prayer circle W Woodruff prayed & John Taylor   was mouth. we had a snow storm through the night      November 22, 1858 ~ Monday      22nd My child Hiram Smith is quite sick this morning He  has spasums or fits & the fever seems to be in the head I   spent the forenoon in the Historian office Journalizing the  court met this morning at 10 oclok. Brother Joseph S.  Murdock called into the office & said one ^Vinson Hamelton^ Stephenson  told him that He would inform him of all the plots that were  laid against this people. Wm Rogers who defended Joseph  Smith at Dixon is keeping a Boarding House with Stephenson  at [Mulners] & he will also reveal what he knows about our  enemies. I have Just learned that our manuscript was  found on the Deseret Alphabet I am glad to hear it     
 Nov 22nd  I called upon the President Young in the evening with  E. T. Benson & Erastus Snow & Wm C. Stains & conversed   till 9 oclok upon the affairs of the court & the present excited   state of the people I set up with my child till 1 oclok during   the night the men & clerks at Kinkades store came   out & kicked the police & stoned them then the police   turned upon them & knocked some half a doz down &   laid them cold on the pavement one was a surgeon  of the armey three Balls was shot from the store   at the poliece but none of them was hit but they   shot one of their own men the Police did not shoot   at all but used their Baton's or clubs      November 23, 1858 ~ Tuesday      23rd my child is some better this morning I met   the mayor A. O. Smoot going to make out the papers   to arest the men at Kinkades store for assaulting  the police. Brother Stanes reported that Mr Wilson   the U.S. district Attorney considered Judge Sinclair   was entirely out of order in his charge to the Jury   & insult to himself in not giving him the opportunity   of meeting with the Grand Jury they are becoming   divided among themselves. I called upon the president   at 2 oclok Brother Sharp came in & gave an account   of the row at Kinkades last night He said that He   was in it from first to last Mr Charles Kinkade   was at the head of the row He tried to provoke a   Quarrel with the Poliece they made all kind of noises   to attempt the police to arest them but the police   did not interfere with them untill they came  out & kicked & stoned the poliece they then knocked   down some half a dozen of them several shots were   exchanged but nobody killed the Poliece quelled the   mob several of which were severely hurt one   asked for two poliecemen to guard him while He   wento to Mr Hartnets to get Dr Hurt to come &   dress the wounds of those who were hurt two   policemen went with him & while returning with   Mr Hartnet one of the poliecemen pistol accidentally   was discharged & the ball went into the ground this   Frightened Mr Hartnet for He thought He was   shot at But He was informed that it was an accident   the Gentiles are vary anxious to get up a row   with this people. The Court met to day at 11 oclk   & done no business except to decide that 2 indians   in the penitentiary should be tried in the next district   south.      I took all the papers or manuscript that   we had written in English for the Deseret Alphabet   & brought it to my draw[er] in the Historians office      November 24, 1858 ~ Wednesday      24th My Child commenced to fail about midnight   and we immediately considered him dying & he continued   to fail untill 25 minutes past 12 oclok [A]M. when He expired   Josep Hyrum Smith son of Wilford & Emma Woodruff  was 1 year 1 Month & 20 days old when He died     
 Nov 24  The Mayor A. O. Smoot had an interview with Govornor   Cummings who thoroughly sustained the poliece   in their course with the mob on Monday night he   told Brother Smoot that the ownly fault he found  in the whole affair was that they did not notify   him that He might be on the ground to met the mob   & head the battle Himself for it was better for the  responsibility to come upon him than upon the  mayor & poliece of the City. He said he had had   [FIGURE] an interview with the Judges & Civil officers of   the US court & they asked him for a posse to take  Brigham Young before the court & asked for council   He told the Judges he would advise them to rule  in court that when any man wished to subpoena   a man to come before the court that the man should   make an Affidavit that the person was an Essential   witness & state what he wished to prove by him  & send it to the man before he forced him to appear   Judje Sinclair thought favorable of it but  Cradle Baugh swore he would not submit to   it. Judge Sinclair said he would not esstablishing   rulings in his court without notifying the Govornor   of it Govornor Cumings said he should not think it good   policy to esstablish Forcible measures in Forceing Brigham   Young to& others to appear in court on evry frivolous case   & even not at all untill the character of the United States   courts had been better esstablished in this Territory than   they had heretofore for you all know damned well that   the people Here have not been vary civilly or lawfully   treated in many instances by dignitaries, and during   the present excited state of things I think it would be   policy to take pacific measures & not try to create disturb-  ance among the people. He told Brother Smoot that if there was   any more mobing in the street He ment to take the Booll by   the Horns himself I do not wish to get into rows but   the police shall not be driven out of these streets they   shall be maintained in the discharg of their duty   The court is resolved to Bring out Brigham Young   before them on a subpoena as a witness in the case of   Burr Govornor Cummings felt troubled about it more   than any thing He had met with fearing President   Young would not comply but all things will be right   The Mayor made arangements to move the court to the   social Hall      November 25, 1858 ~ Thursday      25 I spent most of this day in preparing for the funeral   [FIGURE] & the burrial of my Child which I buried in the first  lot on the south side of the road after passing through the   west gate of the Burying ground it is the third grave visible   some graves have been dug up in making a road     
 Nov 25  I spent the evening with the regency with President Young   there were present Brigham Young D. H. Wells O. Hyde   W. Woodruff G. A. Smith E. T. Benson F. D. Richards A.   Carrington W. W Phelps, Hosea Stout, Samuel Richards   G. D. Watt & R. L. Campbell & Joseph A Young we agreed   upon the arangment of the Alphabet to have it stand perpendicular   also to print the first Book in the Deseret Alphabet & to print   some in each Number of the Deseret News. President Young   has laboured unceseingly to esstablish the Deseret Alphabet   & have it taught in our schools. Judge Sinclair ruled   that [since] they had sit in court but 7 days instead of nearly 60   that He should not count time ownly while sitting in court   The Deseret News published the procedings of the court   which has made the Judge & his party quite mad.      November 26, 1858 ~ Friday      26. We have a hard snow storm this morning I spent   the day in the office scraping      November 27, 1858 ~ Saturday      27th It is a cold day I spent the day in the office scraping  & preparing matter for the deseret Alphabet. Mr Kinkade   & his party were tried before the Mayor and fined   $20 each Kirk Anderson plead their cause or   rather Pled guilty for them      November 28, 1858 ~ Sunday      28th Sunday President Young was confined to his room   all day with illness. The eastern Mail arived last night   at 12 oclok a vary dry mail nothing of interest. I met   with my Quorum at 12 oclok for Prayer R L Campbell  prayed Brother Pugmire was Mouth I spent several   hours in the Presidents office looking over the mail   but found but little of interest. I met with the Twelve   in the Prayer Circle. G. A. Smith Prayed & C. C. Rich was  mouth. The subjects of our prayers were for the President  & for the Lord to overthrow the evil designs of our enemies  against us & to divide them in their Councils that they   may do us no harm      November 29, 1858 ~ Monday      29th A plesant morning Brother Riser came into   the office & spoke of his mission in Jermany He had   four trials & 23 days imprisionment in Hamburgh   for preaching the fulness of the Gospel called mormonism  The court met this morning at 11 oclok Judge Sinclair   has tried to rig a purchase to take up Brigham Young &   his Council & the Twelve for treason he gave a charge   to the Jury to Bring in a charge of treason against   the leaders of this people but to day the District Attorney   has argured before the court & the Grand Jury that they   had no Jurisdiction upon treason that was committed   at any period before the peace commissioners left this   Territory for washington. It is a Historical fact that   treson did exhist in this Territory it is equally a Historical   fact that all treason which exhisted in this Territory was   pardoned By James Buchanan the President of the United   States & By the Govornor of this territory and the     
 Nov 29  Grand Jury have no business to enquire into any thing  before the leaving of the pease commissioners left this   territory neither the Judge or Jery has nothing to do with  any thing that transpired before that event so this ends   the matter of trying to bring up Brigham Young on treason  Judge Sinclair ruled that Green river county was not  in his Jurisdiction. I spent the evening with President   Young & the committee on the Deseret Alphabet      November 30, 1858 ~ Tuesday      30 Wilford started with a team to carry Jesse Fox   to Rush valley to esstablish the south line of our Grant   I went with my team & carried G. A. Smith & others  on the west Bank of Jordon to hold a meeting with   the company to deside whare we would build the dam   to take out the Jordon River to water land we spent  two hours on the ground & adjourned to the Historian   office on wednesday night. We called upon the President   we were informed that the court was trying to get him   to appear as a witness on the morrow it was expected   that there was a plan laid to kill him But God will   ward off the Blow. Hosea Stout had an interview with   Sinclair who said He believed that the object was to get   Brigham Young out & not to carry out law or Justice   I spent most of the afternoon in the office I spent the   evening with the President & the committee on the Deseret  Alphabet we laboured till near 11 oclok on the word Rule   the brethren could not agree upon the sound of it most   of the Company wanted it {{rool}} others want it {{riool}}      December 1, 1858 ~ Wednesday      Dec 1st Many plans had been laid to get President Brigham   Young before the court it was supposed to be effected to  day hence the court room was nearly filled with Mormons   so but few Gentiles could get in at 11 oclok Judge Sinclair  arived their with the members of the court with the Lawyiers   Gov Cummings & about 300 spectators mostly mormons   The Judge called the attention of the assembly said he had   tried to keep order & he should punish any attempt to distu  rb the court. The clerk then red the minutes of yesterday   & the court said he was ready for Business & said he was  ready for the trial of Mr Furgerson. Mr James Ferguson  Presented his resignation as a member of the Bar. The court   would not receive his resignation of the Bar but wished   to have it go to trial. some person in the court room   said that there were a few seats empty which could   be filled. The court said that if the person was not an   officer of the court it was out of order. The court   then red some law touching the case before him & said   it must be tryed. If you wish to plead guilty to the   whole charge then I can give my decission accordingly  Mr Furguson then said that he had not met with this   court & could not be guilty of any charges before the court   and in the accusation it was not stated whare it was   done. The Judge then gave the papers to Mr Burr to   Fix them right so the case might be tried, it then     
 Dec 1st      Read David H. Burr and was done before Judge G. P. Stiles  Furgeson then asked if the court intended to open & exam[ine]   the Records of Judge Stiles He said he should as far as   was necessary to try his case. The court then sent for    the records & red some in them. Mr Smith then spoke   and said that as it was a personal nature he wished the   two Atturneys to manage the matter themselves without   any assistance from either side if Mr Furgeson has help   upon the other side I wish to help Mr Burr Mr Ferguson   said several of my Friends volunteered their services   But I prefered to act alone upon my side that Mr Burr  might upon his side. The Judge then red some more Law  or the same Law over again. Thomas Williams then notified   the court that He should file an action against James Furguson   to be stricken from the roll as an alien. The court told Mr  Fergurson that as there was so many changes in the charge   against him that He would give him time if he wished   He asked for time till next Friday. The Judge Gave it to  him & adjourned till next Friday night. I spent   the afternoon in the office and evening with President Young  & the Committee on the Deseret Alphabet. The Jordan Dam   company met at the Historians office and decided to build the   dam on dry ground in a crook of the river and turn the   river through it instead of building it in the river thinking   it could be done much better & safer than in the river Brother   Forsyth offered to dig out the Earth & stop up the river for   $1700 dollars the channel has to be dug out 16 Rods long   70 feet wide 7 feet deep the Earth is composed of sand   clay & hard pan      December 2, 1858 ~ Thursday      2nd we had a cold night & we have a cold morning and  it remained extremely could through the day I spent the day   through in the office Journalizing & scraping I spent the evening   with President Young & the regency in reading the first Book   in the Deseret Alphabet {{alphabet}} Thare were present B.

 While the Quorum of the Twelve met in there pray[er] circle  the conversation turned upon the subject of the dictation   of the spirit of God & the great importance of following  the dictation of that spirit in all our lives. President   O Hyde said he had often found it difficult to dissern   betwen the dictation of the spirit of the Lord and his   own desires in things which he wished accomplished  O Pratt said that a few days since while praying for  the preservation of his family it came forcibly to   his mind about taking care of one of his boys who  had broaken one of his arms but he put off the imp-  ression & in less than two hours he broak his arm   again. W. Woodruff said that he had from experience   learned so much of the leading & dictation of that spirit  that he knew it was good to follow it his life had  been saved from time to time by following its dictates  a short time since he was impressed to go to president   Youngs in the evening he went & when he got there He   found the Quorum of the Twelve assembled And O   Hyde & John Taylor gave an account of their mission  North & He kept a record of it. G. A. Smith said   that while He was on a mission in virginia in 1837   it was manifest to him that He would be appointed   One of the Twelve these thoughts worried him & he   thought it was an evil impression but it afterwords   proved true He also said I had been 3 days in the  snow & cold & was chilled through & while the man   Zimri H Baxter in Nephi City went to take care   of my Horses & Sister Baxter to get a pan of milk  I felt impressed to lay hands upon their sick child   which they had given over to die I done as the spirit   directed & the child was healed instantly. Elder C. C. Rich  then said while I was going from Los Angelos to   Sanbernadeno I was strongly impressed to stop at   a certain place over night & next day to leave the main  travelled road which I strictly followed & by doing  so I escaped being robed & Murdered by a gang of 60   assassins div[id]ed in three different companies Elder  John Taylor said it was revealed to him he would be   one of the Twelve. F. D. Richards said it was revealed to  him that He would be appointed one of the Twelve  W Woodruff said it was revealed to him while on   Fox Islands that he would be appointed one of the Twelve   before he got a Letter Notifying him of his appointment  G. A. Smith said that the night after Joseph & Hiram Smith   was murdered A spirit came to me & said Joseph & Hyrum   are killed ant you glad of it I was in Michigan at the   time 500 miles from Carthage. O. Hyde said that the  Lord had revealed to us in many ways that the armey  would come in but our desires was so great that they  should not come that we would not receive it

It has been an eventful   year a year in which the hand of God has been made   more visible than in any other period during the present   Generation, some of the greatest events have transpired   during the past year ever manifest among men. the   successful laying of the submarene Atlantic Telegraph   by which communication has been made between two   continents by means of an electrict wire on the bottom  of the Atlantic Ocean is the most steupendious work ever   achieved by man. Europe & America have made liberal   treaties with China & Jappan which have opened their  ports to the trade, commerce & intercourse with the whole   world which have been heretofore entirely closed up   for thousands of Generations. The Emperor of Russia   has laid the foundation for the liberation of millions of   surfs from a species of slavery which has existed  for sCentauries. The inhabitants of British India have   risen in their wrath to throw off the British yoke and   rivers of Blood as it were has been caused to flow in that  land and the spirit of war has been poured out upon   all Nations and France & other Nations have been   arming & preparing for a Deadly conflict. The whole   Earth is becoming corrupt before God, wickedness and   abominations are rapidly increasing throughout all Nations   The Gospel of Jesus Christ has beeen offered to all Nations   By the Elders of Israel whareever they could get access   to the people and the world in a great measure have rejected  the Gospel and the Lord is with holding his spirit from the     
 inhabitants of the Earth and the people are waxing worse &   worse and are becomeing filled with all manner of lying   deceavings robing whoredoms, murders Blasphemies & wicked-  ness of evry kind. Yea Emperors, Kings, Princes, Lords   Presidents Govornors Judges and all the Ruellers of the whole   Earth as well as the people have become so corrupt before   God that He is angry with them and the Lord is begining   to visit them with war & bloodshed & with pestilence tempest   thunder lightning & great hail, whirlwinds & devouring fire   this is plainly manifest in our own Nation even the   United States which is corrupt above all other Nations, they   have sought the destruction of the Saints of God in this land   but the Lord has faught the battles & preserved his saints   The Lord hath done ^it^ his work has been visible before our eyes   and we will acknowled[ge] his hand therein. The United States   Govorment sent fourteen thousand men including souldiers  & teamsters to Utah to put to death Brigham Young Heber   C. Kimball Daniel H. Wells The Twelve Apostle & other leaders   of the Church, they travelled One thousand Miles & expended   some thirty Millions of Dollars to accomplish this evil design   even to shed the Blood of the Lords aniointed. But the Lord   Hedged up their way they had to spend the winter in the   snows of the everlasting rocky mountains and live upon   the flesh of their animals and when they did enter our   valies and cities it was by the permission of the prophets   & saints of God for whom they had come one thousand   miles to slay, and instead of haveing the privilege of sheding   the Blood of the Prophets in Utah but vary few of them   have been permitted to behold their faces. President   Buchannan also sent Judges & officers to this territory  who are filled with wickedness, madness and abominations   of evry kind, they have also laid secret plans to destroy  the prophets & bring distress upon the people by their   decrees from the Judgment seat but the saints have called   upon the Lord in mighty prayer & the Lord has heard &   answered them & he has taken away the wisdom of the   Judges and their power and their folley is manifest in   the eyes of the people and the power of God is manifest in   all these things and he has preserved his Prophets Church   & Kingdom, against all the wrath of the President, Congress,   their armies, Judges and all the Devils who enter into   the tabernacles of men to fight against God & his saints   Judge Sinclair has held an open United States District  Court tofrom the 4th day of Oct. up to the last of Dec   being 88 days and tried all in their power to get   up some action against Brigham Young & the leaders   of the Church but have accomplished a solumn Nothing   ownly tried to persecute James Furgerson & have not  been enabled to do much of that for the Lord has held   them so fast that they have not been enabled to accom-  plish any evil plan which they have laid. The God   of Israel hath laid the foundation of his church and kingdom  upon the Earth in these last days & he has guided it by   his Almighty power up to the present day he has preserved   his saints in the midst of all the ware fare against them     
 of wicked men and Devils He is bringing to pass daily  the fulfillment of the Holy scriptures & the Book of   Mormon, the fullness of the Gentiles is fast coming in   and the Lord is fast preparing the way for the salva-  tion of the House of Israel he is withdrawing his spirit   from the inhabitants of the Earth and at the same time  inspiring his Prophets with wisdom Knowledge   & understanding that they have been enabled through the  Mercy of God to thwart all the evil designs of the wicked   and ungodly who have laid snares for the feet of the Right-  eous. The signs of the Times clearly indicate that the   gentile Nations are ripened in iniquity and that God  is about to sit in Judgment upon the^m^ Nations      [rest of page blank]
