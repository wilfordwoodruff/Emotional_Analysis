As the years rolled by, that youthful desire developed intoa passion, which has dominated my life, and spurred me on to make an earn-est individual effort to rescue our family history from oblivion.Unfortunately, I have not had the means, to enable me to devote my time wholly to this object, but have had to rely mainly

I shall then, upon notice from youto this effect, hold myself inreadiness to obey this call,at the end of such time.I desire to add thatat the time I was visitedin relation to taking amission, I fully explainedmy circumstances to thebrethren, and had no idea

But I finally succeeded in tracing my direct line of ancestry to "Matthew Woodruff" one of the Original Proprietors of Farming-town, Conn, in 1640. This much being accomplished, I turned my attention to writing up the collateral branches. But what I desire more particularlyis to collect more definite information in regard to our common ancestor, "Matthew Woodruff" I have been tryingfor many years, to find out where hecame from, and have not succeeded. He is traditionally supposed to have been an "Englishman," but I have not been able to find any historical evidenceEstablishing the fact. Through the courtesy of a friend, I have been enabled to visit, and spend a year in "Old England," during which time I made speical effort to connect the "American" and "English Branches,"

Presuming upontheir mention of you, I wish to make someinquiries concerning a party of whomyou may have known at some time.I was born and raised in Kirtland O.not many miles from Kirtland. A greatmeny years ago a Mormon preacher bythe name of Reed married my mother'sSister and went to Nauvoo Mo. The familyhave never heard of her since. I have triedmany times to find out what became ofher but never succeeded. Did you everknow aught of them? Her maiden namewas Buckingham and she lived atBundysburgh, O. She still has a sisterliving within 4 miles of the MormonTemple at Kirtland O. I dare say thereare many there yet whom you rememberwell. If you ever knew aught of heror if any of your people who once livedat Nauvoo, or if she has any childrenliving you will confer a great favorby putting me in communication withthem.
