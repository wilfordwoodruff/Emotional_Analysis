 My son, then, is paid very little, always because of the little know-  ledge of the language – he speaks good spanish – and his wage   just covers the expenses!    I will be then very happy to know where Salt Lake City   is, the main city of our religion, and that from   there I receive an aid, a small sum of money to   alleviate my misery, that terrifies my soul so much.

 Macon Ga, Nov 1st [18]92.    Rev. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Sir,    I have been engaged for many years,   in collecting materials for a History of the   "Woodruff Family." From my early boyhood,   I have had an intense desire, to learn   something of my Ancestry.  The "Old Family  Bible," was authority for two or three gen-  erations, and back of that time, was a   profound mystery. As the years rolled   by, that youthful desire developed into  a passion, which has dominated my life,   and spurred me on to make an earn-  est individual effort to rescue our   family history from oblivion.    Unfortunately, I have not had the means,   to enable me to devote my time wholly   to this object, but have had to rely mainly 
 am poor, and have noth-  ing to fit myself out with  to start so soon.  Nor could  I leave my wife & children   in circumstances I should  like to under my present  condition.  For thiese reasons,  I would Kindly ask you  to honorably release me  from this mission for a pe-  riod of one year.  I shall then,   upon notice from you  to this effect, hold myself in  readiness to obey this call,  at the end of such time.    I desire to add that  at the time I was visited  in relation to taking a  mission, I fully explained  my circumstances to the  brethren, and had no idea

I am at all  times subject to the direction of the authorities, and if it is desir-  ed that I go on the mission mentioned at once I will do so. I desire  to state, however, that I am considerably involved financially and am  carrying quite a large interest in the Salt Lake and Los Angeles Ry.  Co., Saltair Beach Company, and Inter-Mountain Salt Company, and shoul^d^  it be deemed necessary for me to fill this mission at the presaent my  interests in these Companies would have to be sacrificed and I would  be considerably embarrassed financuially in other directions. I real-  ize that all these affairs should be secondary when a call is made on  a servant of the Lord to labor in his vineyard and consequently hold  myself subject to your wishes in the premises.    Your Brother in the Gospel,  Isaac A. Clayton    I am acquainted with my brother Isaac's financial condition  and know the statement above to be true  Your Brother  N. W. Clayton

 on correspondence, and such chance   opportunities as came in my way   as I journeyed along. But I finally   succeeded in tracing my direct line of   ancestry to "Matthew Woodruff" one of   the Original Proprietors of Farming-  town, Conn, in 1640. This much being   accomplished, I turned my attention   to writing up the collateral branches.   But what I desire more particularly  is to collect more definite information   in regard to our common ancestor,   "Matthew Woodruff" I have been trying  for many years, to find out where he  came from, and have not succeeded.   He is traditionally supposed to have been   an "Englishman," but I have not been   able to find any historical evidence  Establishing the fact. Through the courtesy   of a friend, I have been enabled to visit,   and spend a year in "Old England," during   which time I made speical effort to connect   the "American" and "English Branches,"

In a recently received letter from   "Samuel DeVeaux Woodruff, Esq, St Cath-  erines, Ontario, Canada," he mentioned   your name as a Descendant of the   same "Matthew Woodruff" of Farm-  ington, Conn.

I should be very pleased to receive   the particulars of your line; and also,   all facts in regard to our Ancestor,   "Matthew."

 My parents who imigrated from  wales have many living and  dead relatives and friends there  and they are anxious for my  mission to be changed to  South Wales if this meets your  mind and will. They have tried  to obtain a genealogy of their  forefathers so that they may do  work for them in the temple and  this is what they want me to  do if my mission can be  changed. I have contracted to  teach school in Providence for  five months and expected to   start on the 21st. of next month.  Now dear President if you, in your   wisdom, see fit to change my  mission to South Wales and  can possibly give me six months  to get my accounts paid up and  thereby give me a little time to

 Denver Colorado  Nov 6th [18]92    Mr Woodruff,  Dr Sir,  I have recently formed  the acqueintance of Mr & Mrs R M Thompson  who are sojourning here for a time. and in  conversation with them they mentioned their  pleasant sojourn in your city and your kind-  ness to them while there. Presuming upon  their mention of you, I wish to make some  inquiries concerning a party of whom  you may have known at some time.  I was born and raised in Kirtland O.  not many miles from Kirtland. A great  meny years ago a Mormon preacher by  the name of Reed married my mother's  Sister and went to Nauvoo Mo. The family  have never heard of her since. I have tried  many times to find out what became of  her but never succeeded. Did you ever  know aught of them? Her maiden name  was Buckingham and she lived at  Bundysburgh, O. She still has a sister  living within 4 miles of the Mormon  Temple at Kirtland O. I dare say there  are many there yet whom you remember  well. If you ever knew aught of her  or if any of your people who once lived  at Nauvoo, or if she has any children  living you will confer a great favor  by putting me in communication with  them. Very Resp. by Miss A O Porter over

I offer her free rent if she  can obtain means to build two  rooms to my house in the 20 Ward,  this city, and the widow herself  feels that she would thus also  have a father near for her little-  ones. This with the income above  mentioned and a little of her  own earning, would enable her  to not fall a burden to any-one  For that purpose about $500.00  would be needed and confidingly  we ask that the church pay her  that amount, or as much of it  as you may deem proper under  these circumstances.

Dear Brother:    A matter of business  here involves my own interests and  those of my family to a very great   extent, but which my circumstances will  not permit me to attend to personally,  and as I have few acquantances in  Northern Utah, I therefore beg to engage your  attention to this matter to the extent of  entrusting it to some trustworthy person.  The business referred to is this: During the  lifetime of Brother Lot Smith, my husband,  he settled upon three separate pieces of property  near Tuba City.

Prest: Wilford Woodruff,   Dear Bro:    I have been informed by  the First Council of Seventies through their Secretary,  that I have been selected as a missionary, and  was asked when I could be ready. I replied that  I thought I could arrange my affairs so as to  be ready to go by the first of may of this year.  This was done some two or three weeks ago, but I  have heard nothing further regarding it. Now  what I desire is that, if you have not already  done so, you will kindly advise me as soon   as convenient, where and when I will be expected  to go so that I in settling my affairs, can have something definite to work to.    If it is agreeable to you, and there is nothing  impromper in the indication I should prefer to go  to England, as my parents came from there; as   you may know, and I might be able to gather 
 shape to leave, but the  Lords will be done not mine.    Please let me know assoon  as possible so that I can be  prepared.    Your Brother in the Gospel    Charles E. Walton    F. I. Jones.    Bishop.    Monticello Ward.

The  Administrator of Bro Smith's estate in   Arizona caused all of these properties to be  inventoried and in due course of law  they will be sold and myself and  family be thus rendered homeless, as I  do not possess the means for buying this  place. It is the desire of all the Saints in  this vicinity to see there separate properties  restored if possible to the respective wives of  Bro Smith occupying them at the time of  th his death. A friend here has been  working with this end in view and has  succeeded in getting Sister Mary's property  (the Canyon farm) stricken off the list of  inventoried properties belonging to the estate and  she is now in undisputed possession of it.
