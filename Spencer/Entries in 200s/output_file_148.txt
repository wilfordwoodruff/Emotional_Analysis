 W. Woodruff spoke of the importance of sustaining the Agricultural Society, the interestof that Society, like the Kingdom of God, must live, and the Bishops being called and or-dained by the servants of the Living God, to look after the Temporal things of the Kingdom;He dwelt particularly on the present crisis, which should stimulate every one to takean increased interest in sustaining ourselves. He refer d to the Hand of God whichhas been so visible, that every one living in the line of his duty cannot fail to see.Being lately called to take the Presidency of that Society, he desired to have the co-operation of the Bishops, by laying this important subject before the members of theirrespective wards, and endeavour to prevail upon every male member to become an annualsubscriber, which only amounted to 1/2 a Bushel of wheat. He said it was the intentionof the Board to build a good House, and cultivate land for the growth of choiceFruits &c as soon as funds would enable them to do so, they have just completed a PremiumList, and though out funds, they are acting on a principle of Faith, and intend to offerevery encouragement by way of stimulating the Brethren on this important subject; Hespoke of a time when we should be thrown entirely upon our own resources from recent dispatches, and it behoves us to be awake and energetic, and the Lord will bless us. 
 Wilford Woodruff, being present, remarked, that as the time for holdingour Annual Fair was at hand, he wished the Bps of the several wardsto appoint persons to deliver public addresses in each ward, on the subjectof holding the Fair, and encourage the people to bring specimens of theirworkmanship in cloth, and other products of their skill and industry. 
 Elder Wilford Wilford, entirely coincided with the previous remarks  we have men in our midst who would sell the Kingdom, their Houses, Farms,anything else that will strengthen the hands of our enemies, let us thereforeone and all walk up to our duties, that are now required of us, and backup our Bishops, the Mayor &c 
 Elder W. Woodruff said many of our children were being sent tooutside schools, who deny new revelation, and many other principlesof the Gospel, he opposed it in his feelings, and would not do it himself.We ought to sustain our own Teachers who are in full faith and fellowship with us.There are many dead branches which must sooner or later be cut off, for they neither goto meeting nor pray, but can swear, get drunk &c.The Lessor Priesthood should be organized in every ward to act in their lot and place,no man should feel himself so high as to refuse to act in that priesthood.He then spoke of the respect that Joseph Smith the Prophet entertained towards the Teachersand submitted to a severe criticism by the first Teacher that ever entered his house.The Bishops held very responsible positions, and he felt to encourage them to be faithfulfor God required it at their hands.If we only become united as a people before God, no power can ever harm the anointed ofGod. We have no time to waste, but let us be up and do our duty, act as Patriarchsover our own house, for it was painful to see our young people growing up in Infidelity,and give themselves up to all kinds of wickedness.We had more faith in the prayers of ten righteous men, than in all the big gunson the face of the earth, Prest Young and George Q Cannon were instances ofdeliverance, as the result of faith and prayer. 
 Elder W. Woodruff was pleased with the representation of the Bishops to night, the blessing of the Lord will rest upon the Missionaries who go in the right spirit.He suggested that a Surgeon and Midwife should go along, and that all the company operate in one common interest, carrying out the principle of the united order; and work for each other. 
 Randolph Rich Co May 31, 1874Dear Brother BrighamI write to say that we have organized Evry Branch in this Stake of Zion in the United Order except one, had a good time, much of the Spirit of the Lord with us. Most of the people receive it.My object in writing at this time is to say to you that Brothers Rich, Budge, & myself visited Soda Spring Branch, & preached to what people there was there of the Saints but did not organize Because the president & most of the leading men of that Branch of the Church were gone from home, butht most of those who were present voted to join the order, and on[e] that is in your jurisdiction I thought perhaps you could visit them and organize them by sending an appointment so they could be at home. We have held 23 Meeting and organize 11 Branches of the United Order. I expect to start for Salt Lake City in few days, shall Meet the Saints at Almy on my return Your Brother in the Gospel W.

I beleive this is a healthy beality [end of upside-down text]LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE42 Islington, LiverpoolApl. 6th  1892Prest Wilford Woodruff & CounsellorsSalt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brethern:I am thankful for the privilege ofwriting to you on this auspicious day. Deeply grateful am I for the tidings of what will transfirein our loved mountain home on this the sixty second anniversary of the establishing of the churchof Christ in the earth. God is merciful to His people, we live to behold a day that I did notwhope would transpire within the limited span allotted time on earth.Brethren of the Presidency and Twelve, I join you in spirit this day duringyour celebratiansand offerings unto God. When a boy, I rejoiced during the services oflaying the capstone on the Temple at Nauvoo; as a man, I worship the Being who hasbrought about this great triumph to the saints; here is demonstrated their skill perseveranceand industry, a blended monument of the zeal and integority of the people, a thing of beauty anda joy forever. Your own feelings will tell you how joyfully I would join you ^on^ this occasion, but under the circumstances I could not hope or expect to attend these celebrationswhich precede the most complete dedicatory cerimonies which I trust are not far distantAlthough far distant from the stiring scenes which have transried among youduring the last ninteen months, yet I have been with you in spirit and sustained^you^ with my prayers before the Lord. It was not difficult for one to understand the various moverwhich have been made and I approved of the "Manifesto" proclamations etc which have ^been^insued by the Presidency and Twelve, unto the saints. In all these mutatitions but oncehave I felt the solid ground move under my feet, and that was long ago when the eldersmaintained that the "manifesto" not only abrogated all plural marriages but ^also^ ad-vised the brethren to break up their plural families and discard, seperate from, ignorethose women who were wives anterior to the ^passage of those^ vile ^ants^ polygamy laws, as well as later marriages. 
 I have laid these matters away, and concluded it will be time enough across thatbridge when I reach it. The business which devolves upon me with furnish awhileemployment while I am in this land and I trust in God for all future exigencies.Perhaps more will be known in relation to the sitriahan after the anvesty is pro-I caimed, than is dreamed of now. One thing, in relations to my present feelings,is quite clear. I would rather live without all my wives, entirely seper-ate from them, than to live exclusively with any one of my wives. While Ihold these feelings yet they are now and with Gods help my whole beingshall be subject to "thus saith the Lord".I am but poorly in health, and in fact all of the brethrenin the office are loosing their energy, but we are still able to keep thingsmoving and I am improving so are the brethren I believe. Summer is comingand we all feel a sensation of returning health. I am quite sure the climatehere is changing for the worse and occasionally Englishmen express themselvesas being & disgusted with the climate.We left New Brighton and now occupy a house near Princes Parkat a rent of two hundred dollars per year. Have used some money to purchasenecessary articles for keeping house. There were a few things at 42 we could use butmost everything there would not bear transportion, too old and broken. Will ^soon^ sendthe amount used and if you do not choose to allow it I will pay it.Of course I do not know how you are pleased with our administrationbut I am well pleased with the way we are getting on.Please send us a good writer for sub-editor and a first class printer. Weare dependant on Union people,   Mr. Davis having left us   and these are hardmen who calculate to get pay without much work. Bro. Anderson ought tobe released as early as September ^if not before^ and the man who suceeds him ought to haveexperience in the field before he comes into the office.God bless you my dear brethren with love in which thebrethren and Mrs. Y. joinYour Bro in ChristBrigham Young 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42, Islington, Liverpool.May 6th 1892Presidents W WoodruffG Q CannonJos F SmithDear Brethren:  The proposition todetain Bro. Osmond to repace Bro. Anderson is impracticable forthe following reasons. Bro. Osmond was here on mission two yearsfrom 1884 to 1886. He came here year last Jan. it will be two yearsnext Jan. His health is much impared, His financial conditionat home is embarassing, and under these circumstances I havearranged to release him in the near future. I presume you willlook upon his case as I do. He is willing to stay, but another winter herewould prove fatal to him ^I believe^; within the last three months he has been at deathsdoor; he now presides in London.I have spent some forty pounds for house furniture the bills formost of it I forward you have no bills for the ten pounds Furniture etcat 42 would not bear transportation the brethren use that which we left thatwhich is good for anything. I will pay these bills should ^you^ intimate it ismy business to do so. Have taken my family notraveling to improve the healthof my wife and children who have been seriously afflicted at times, hencethe great expense to me. Bro. Anderson is gradually failing in health soare most of the brethren who sleep at 42; business makes it necessary forthem to do so. Printers earn their wages by shirking, must be watched closely.My brethren & family join in loveYour Bro in Christ.Brigham Young

Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother: Your favor Feb. 15thcame to hand and was perused with uncommoninterest and I will answer you according to the lightthat is in me. First, we thank you for your kind invi-tation to attend the aniversary of your birth day Heavenhas favored you and I thank God you are recoveredfrom your recent illness and for the presservation of yourlife to comfort the saints and your family. I will sug-gest that your next invatation anti date your birthday, time enough ^for us^ to joni you, especially should youconsider our presence necessary rather desiriable.Curiosity I believe is the mainspring that has broughtstrangers to our meetings, and I believe that, curiosity iswaning; for all over the mission with about three exceptionsthe people feel in the districts where our people elders labor, thata mormon elder, with his gospel is a nuissance. Thepeople do not want the gospel and while we do batptizea few not one proselyte to each elder in the year. Still itis a fact that, the elders meet with but little but abuse.We are warning the people and ^doing^ but little else. I have feltto put a force in here this nation, that, the people will be leftwithout excuse, I have found not one case where the distributionof tracts has brought one soul to our meetings or into the Church. 
 So far as emigration matters are concerned, the english por-tion is rather insignificant, what ^emigrants^ there are could ship atsouthhampton joining german steamer at that point whichcould bring our Scandinavian emigration better thanthere present method of Conveyance, in my opinion. But thisis a matter that with your permission I will examine into moreparticularly, not with a view of doing anything but for informationpending future events.President Woodruff, this mission is a dead beet so faras proselyting is concerned. My whole anxiety has been to warnthe people, outside of that, the mission is shurnken to an insig-nificant compass. We hire halls and but few come; I am afraidthere is culpable neglect on the part of the saints, many have tobe nursed and ^for the elder^ to leave them the saints to break new ground manybecome cold indifferent and must have a frequent application ofgospel warming pan, and I have known cases when it was impossi-ble to resussitate them. Our batteries are too light metal, the Lordcan turn their ^the peoples^ indifference to interest, but we cannot.Prest Saml Thurman, London, reports some interest among strangersthere but it is comparatively little; one of the elders had been laboringfor two months and thought if he could be left in that vicinity for a few weekslonger he could make one or two converts. We have to contend withsupreme indifference of the people, or abuse. Your son-in-law is aboutcorrect. I am not discouraged and we have many conferences toattend within the next two months.I could give you more detailes but these are facts as Iunderstand the situation.God bless you with long life future Love to brethren, in whichthe brethren join.

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day Saints.P.O. Box B. Salt Lake City, Utah May 10, 1895.Elder Brigham Young,City.Dear Brother:The changed conditions in the Church educational systemhave rendered it desirable, in the opinion of the First Presidency and themembers of the Boards of Young University and the Latter-day SaintsCollege, of Salt Lake City, that these two institutions of learning shouldbe consolidated, and to preserve the name of President Brigham Young itis suggested that the new establishment be known as Young Institute. Itis thought the best interests of the school will be subserved by greatlyreducing the number of members of the Board (say to seven); as at presentit is next to impossible to get together a sufficient number to form aquorum. Under these circumstances it will be necessary for the greaterportion of the members of the board of Young University to resign. Weourselves have each of us already tendered our resignation, and we writethis to you to ask if you have any objections to resigning also. If youhave not, will you be so kind as to forward your resignation to thePresident of the Board of Young University George Q. Cannon.Respectfully your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Utah, June 29, 1888.Elder Brigham Young,Dear Brother:Your brief letter of the 17th has just reached me. I am not surprised to hear from you of the fatigue and lameness which you feel in consequence of the hard trip that you have taken. You have passed through a very rough country, and if you have had many miles of road to make you have had a tedious time.There is nothing particularly new since I last wrote to you, excepting that we are still progressing somewhat in our attempt to aef-fect a settlement of the Church suit; but as we progress the hunger of the officers seems to increase. A comparison was made to us by a man not of our faith that they reminded him of wolves sitting and licking their chops, waiting for their prey. Their eyes glare at the mention of property with the same eagerness and hunger that wild animals have when they scent their prey. But the Council has decided that we had better do everything we can to effect a settlement, even if it takes all the property that they claim. We would liked you to have been with us to have given us your views upon the subject. It wis with great reluctance that we do this the same reluctance with which we have yielded our property in days past, when armed mobs have stood 
 around and driven us from our homes and taken possession of that which the Lord had given to us. But this will stop these painful proceedings before the Examiner, and will perhaps be the means of saving our temples and meeting-houses and sacred places from direct attacks, if it does not savie them entirely; at least, we hope so. The case of course, will be carried up to the court of last resort for its decision.My health and the health of the brethren general-ly is good. Brother Grant has not been well; but has been able to attend our two last Councils. Yourself and Brothers Thatcher and Teasdale are the only ones absent now of the Quorum. With love and praying the Lord to bless you and preserve you from every evil, in which Brothers Geo. Q. and Jos. F. join,I remain,Your Brother, Wilford Woodruff

 L. D. S. Historian's Office,P. O. Box 321,Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3 1887Dear Brother BrighamYour Welcome Letter of April 19 is received and I was very glad to hear from you. I was vary much pleased with the spirit of your Letter Now with regard to Brother Tenney, I will say I did not know that He had any Appointment by any badyOne Except the Mission I gave him to the Zonies, Lagoonies, Islata &c. while I was in that country He done Nothing in the Mission after the Rail Roading commenced And after He came out of prision and broke down financia-lly and in spirit & health We could not Expect him to do much at Missionary Work at present But in coresspondence with the presidency we have thought it Wisdom to Esstablish a mission with the Maricopas, Pemos Papagoes and then reach the Yaquis but not to begin with theYaquis first. And having travelled with Tenney and knowing that He could preach Well in spanish I thought He would make one good hand with a company of 4 or 6 as the case might be to Engage in that Mission He might not be a suitable man to Lead in it I have written to him upon the subject and it would Meet his Mind to Engage 
 in that Mission. I did not know that he had Labored among the Navajos or had a Mission to them. He helped Baptise 115 Zunies and Labored some 6 months with the Islata I am Satisfied Brother Brigham that as the Gentilses are so fast and so thoroughly rejecting the Gospel that it is our Duty to more thorou-ghly commence to Esstablish MissionaryStations among the Lamanite throughout this Western world. Now of course I do not know what instructions you have received from the presidency concerning your Mission or to what Extent But as the Navajos Join on to those Northern tribes I should think that you ought to have the oversight of the Oribas Moquis, Zonies Lagoonies & Islata. The Islataare a very rich intelegant indostrios people, ther City Numbers 3 or 4000 They are 12 Miles below Albukirke you have probably been there They have vary rich vineyards orchards & fields. John King was ther old patriark when we was there, We held 2 Meetings with the Lagoonies and the Govorner & spiritual Adviser went with us to Islata and staid with us while there, where We Returned they went up the River but said they would be back as soon as we did, but they did not come If they had been there we should have baptized the whole village and there has been No preaching there since to my knowledge 
 L. D. S. Historian's Office,P. O. Box 321,Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3, 1887[written in pink ink] I will now say according to my view it is of but Little use to baptize the Lamanites and then go and Leave them without any guideThey should be organized and some judicious Elder apointed to Labor with them and teach them both by precept & Example, before they can be qualified to Live as Latter Day Saints, and we shall have to adopt that policy Hereafter as far as we can[written in black ink] I gave Brother Milton S. Ray a Mission a good while ago to preach to the Maricopas and Esstablish a school among them which He has done and I understand thye the children are learning fast. Brother Ray is now in Salt Lake City He took his wife there because she was sick his Location is in Messa City but it is so hot there the Sisters can hardly Live. My Daughter Bell Moses has come home to her Mothers in Smithfield with her children she is almost Dead with the Heat. Brother Moses is calculating to sell out and come North in consequence of the Sickness of his Wife If we Esstablished a Mission among these South-ern tribes I did not Expect they would get at 
 ^it^ untill fall, and my view was for them to commence with the Maricopas and Pimas located on Salt River and work South through the Papagoes and others untill they Reach the Yaquis. It will be a good while before they would reach the Yaquis. Of course we want all the Wisdom we can get to carry out these Missions Missions among the Lamanites. I admire your views very much to get the permit approbations & all the assistance we can from the Authorities of Mexico, to assist us in so imporant an undertaking. Of course we want Men who can speak spanish to Engage in those Missions There should not be less that 4 to go upon that Mission so when they seperate there can be two together[written in pink ink] I had a few names in my Mind which Ithink I sent to president Taylor for his Approval ^Big^ T. W. Brookbank A M Tenney, J P J Christofferson one Stewart at Kanab And a young Man whose Mother a Widow ^Greer^ at the Meadows I have not the two last names before me[written in black ink] I would Like your views Brother Brigham in this Matter what would you think of Brother Brookbank as a Leader and Tenney & Stewart as counsellers I am Well acquainted with Brother Brookbank I should think He would make a good Leader[written in pink ink] I was sorry the Mexicans killed Cajeme the Yaqui Chief[written in black ink] Have the Mexicans taken possession of ther Land 
 L. D. S. Historian's Office,P. O. Box 321,Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3 1887Now I have got through speaking of the mission I will write of sumthing Els. Of course I wouldwould be pleased to be With you and take a Hunt in the Mountains, but I Expect I would tire out rather rather sooner than I used to. I am in good health & spirits, but I got tired out in half a days tramp I am today where you left me. I take the same boat and go & get and get a few ducks in the season but now I ownly ketch a string of club fish, in the same pond the club weigh from 6 to 20 oz each net may go over 1 lb but they are very good Eating for a change, and quite plenty in the season I have seen half a Barrel in 10 foot square. I spend most of my time in my Room in my Room reading & writing or ratherscribling as you will learn before you get through reading this Letter. I dont pretend to write so any body can read it without the gift of translation. But I can read it as well as I can Capt Hoopers. As I cannot preach in public I go to the Temple and do what I can for my Dead. I met 125 friends, in the Temple on the 2 March, the day following my birth day, 73, 
 of them went through for my Dead. I spoke to them a short time But Left the city the same Evening, this is the first time but one that I have spoken to any company in the capacity of a meeting for 28 Months I was sealed for 73 couple of Dead friends, while there which makes 3000 souls of Dead friends while I have had Baptized Endowed & sealings, for, and have 265 more to attend to to finish up my Record, which I hope I may Live to Accomplish wile it I received a good Letter from Moses Thatcher giving me a whole history of all the Mexican Mission which was very interesting to me[written in pink ink] The amount of Land bought was 10000 Acres at Diaz48000 [Acres at] Juarez 75000 A Carralis133000 Acres totalAlso $76000. dollar worth of Machinery in operation A 25 Horse power, Engine with saw, shingle & Lath Mill, plaining &c. The whole History was interesting to me. He was in Utah though but few knew it, I got a good letter from Lorenzo Snow was going to winkapie camp to settle some difficulty in his tribe. I got a good Letter from Joseph F. Smith He got Well again in a great Measure.[written in black ink] Concerning affairs in Utah I Expect you get most of the News from the papers. There is quite Rejoicing over the Removal of Dixon & Brother Jaques said in one Letter that Zane had resigned but I have

Snow Smith has been very Low But Her Brother Lorenzo Says she is slowly Recovering. I suppose you know that Susan Gates Lost her two children on the Islands. As far as I am concerned I am a Bachelor I have Neither Wife nor child with me.

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day Saints.P. O. Box B. Salt Lake City, Utah, Feb. 5, 1896.Elder Brigham Young,Dear Brother:Inasmuch as you have been appointed toattend the San Juan Stake Conference, which will be held at Bluff on the22nd and 23rd insts., we wish you to consider the following items ofbusiness while there. You may find it necessary to release the Presi-dent of the Stake and Bishop Neilsen of the Bluff Ward, in consequenceof their advanced age and growing infirmities. We suggest Platt D.Lyman for President and Cumen Jones for Bishop should you find it agree-able and proper to make such changes. Of course you will consult thefeelings of the people in these matters. We understand the spiritualand temporal prosperity of the Stake require a change in the adminis-trative officers.The Burnham Ward should have another Bishop. Bro. LutherBurnham seems to consider the labor of presiding in that ward too oner-ous in his present straitened circumstances, and that a more active manwould suit the people better. If you find this to be the case, makesuch changes as may be necessary for the spiritual and temporal prosper-ity of the people of that ward.The Jensen case ought to be handled with care. If, on inves-tigation, you find that Bro. Jensen of Mancos was justified in notattending the San Juan Conference recently held at Fruitland, continueyour investigation of the case, which he (Jensen) submitted to us, atthe Stake Conference which will be held at Bluff on the 22nd and 23rdinsts.

Salt Lake City, Utah March 5, 1898.Elder Brigham Young, "El Carmelo,"Pacific Grove, California.Dear Brother Brigham:We were much interested in listening to yourletter of Feb. 24th, but grieved to hear that Sister Lizzie's progresstowards recovery is so slow and her weakness so great. We commend yourfaith, and with you we believe that the promises made in her behalf willbe fulfilled. You have our sincere and constant prayers that it may beso. In this feeling we are encouraged by the receipt of your telegramon President Woodruff's birthday in which you state that she is improv-ing. We trust your own health remains good. Ours, we are happy to say,is excellent.The weather here has changed from winter tospring dry, clear and pleasant. This gives us hope that it is the sameon the coast, and if so, is more propitious for Sister Lizzie's recoveryas well as more agreeable for yourself. The early advent of spring inthis region has, however, given cause for considerable apprehension of ascarcity of water next season, as the snow in the mountains surroundingthis and neighboring valleys is said to be far below the average.We had a call yesterday from Mr. Kraft who gaveus a full particulars concerning your situation and the condition of Sister Young, and he spoke of your devoted attentions to her in hersickness. He told us also of the faith which you and your daughterKatie, his wife, have in relation to Sister Young's recovery. We appre- 
 nan 
 ciate his kindness in calling upojn us as we were quite desirous tolearn all we could about you.Prest. Smith has been east for the last two weeks, he is ex-pected back Monday afternoon.Of course you will have learned of the death of James T.

Westernin the presidency and after whom ^(S. W. W.)^ many anxiousenquires are ^made^ by his releatives and strangers. Youcan see by Bro. Woods letter the situation at a glance.Will you kindly refer this matter to Bro. Western andwho may be found at or near Fillmore, and perhapshe will take immediate steps to remove the causeof distress which now afflict the brethren.I am pleased to inform you that successis met with by brethren in their ministerial laborsin a few places in the mission. Since we con-centrated the force of the Conference in London, thingsare looking up a little in that city. Baptisms occuroccasionally, and the brethren are pushing outdoor meet-ings with Considerable zeal, in fact, this is the rulethroughout the mission, Hiring Halls is useless for thepeople will not come to hear the elders, but street 
 preaching seems to suit the spirit of the times better.We are in good health and prospering inall departments to a limited extent. The office businessin every particular is right up to the mark ^Mr^ Tenbroeckto the Contrary notwithstanding. We are obliged to sendemigrants sterage when ^their means is limited^ they can go no other way; andwe cannot send advices, particulars in numbers anditems of age destination etc, matter for making out theirtickets on that side of the water only as we have beendoing, for we cannot cable all these particulars, ^it would be too expensive^. Infuture we shall write Mr. T. by the vessel preceedingthe sailing of companies that, saints are expecting to sailwe on such a vessel, with all the data we are in possessionof, which will not be sufficient to enable him to makeout the RR. tickets, for changes occur up ^to^ the dayof sailing.God is blessing our labors, and tho  the weather iscool yet it is warm enough to bring health to me.Mrs Y is better now ^in health^ than at any time ^previous^ while residing onthis Island.We are praying for your continued welfare, &,^also^ mourning over the political ^complications^ which seem to crop out inunlooked for quarters to an alarming extent. God helpus to keep up this end of the even or. Our hands arefull, and often our hearts are too full and God alonecan relieve us of the burthen.Love to the brethren.

Metz who wishes to be releived, person-ally, and have the Netherlands Mission account cred-ited the amount of emigration money paid forthe parties named viz   30. 9. 6. His proposition to havethe note transfered to me or to this office is altogetherinadmissable but as Bro. M. felt positive that the elderwould pay it, and no doubt Bro Brown is equally assanguine, tho  I have had my faith much shaken un-der simelar circumstances, perhaps you will do something.The Netherlands Mission needs assistance moreelders. I found Prest. Metz in very poor health and hehad but two efficient assistants Bros A. Farrell and Hyde. Bro. Subert is not advanced in the langu-age far enough to render much help for the present.The labors of these brethren are ^at^ Rotterdam & Amsterdam, withtheir hands full, indeed, a portion of the time they are badlyover worked. Neither Bro. Farrell nor Hyde are in robust health. Prest. Metz is quite feeble; poor food, cold weather,exposure and over work have made a great change in 
 rugged man. Unless the genial climate of Arizona restoreshim to his normal condition of health I doubt his livingvery long. I was more surprised to find him in this con-dition because I have known him as arough and readypontuismans able to endure every hardship.Bro. Farrell understands the business of the Missionand speaks the language very well. Bro. Metz has all confi-dence in him and feels sanguine that he is competent to suc-ceed him in the presidency of the Dutch or, rather Nether-land Mission. Bro F is not more than 24 years old buthas much experience at home and abrodt. However thethe Mission must have a presedents ^perhaps you can send a man.^ Bro. Metz must bereleased and will part sometime in November. Thesaints love him and they also love the other elders, Bro. M. has done a good work.More elders are needed. There are but four elders at presentin the Netherland Mission and there ought to be not less than twelve. Brussels 2; Antwerp two; Liege two; Hollandsix. From the best information I can obtain and good work canbe done in that country if help is given them.The British Mission still lives but the pulse is feeble. TurkishMission is struggling for existence. The brethren are encouraged by the Spirit, not externals. With a little trouble I could meet the Turk-ish Minister, it is a great thing in the world to be known, and Ihave noticed a revolution in the feelings of educated classes inthis country.My health is good. My daughter ^Katie^ cables she will come, she is in adistressing condition and comes for a surgical operation, I will meet her in N. Y.which I trust you will approve of.Love to the Brethren; God bless you.Your Bro in Christ.Brigham Young.

 Bishop and Counsel alsothe Teachers Qourumand I thought it would be easy to raise the moneybut I was mistakenSome have promised tohelp and I have waitedmonth after month inthe vain hope that manywould assist meI also owe Mr Dean thetailor for one suit ofClothes. 4. Pounds hewas very kind and mademe the offer and saidtime and again that Ineed be in no hurryI told him as soon asI returned home I wouldsend the money as soon as I could get straightenedaround. I also owe BrotherGrant Z Bullock 3. dollarsand my Sister ten poundsall of which I promisedto return at an early datebut the money belongingto the Spendloves ^Boy^ is not 
 quite correct, he gave mea check for ten dollarsthis Spring early and toldone to send it to hisfolks it was some timebefore I could get a ten dollar bill for itsome time after he askedme if I had sent it. Itold him no as I hadonly just got it changedbut would, he went offwith a sheep herd andafter he left I concludedto keep the money untillthe boy came back to deseretand let him send it him-self then if there was anyloss it would not by myfault; he came here inJune and I wrote aletter to his folk, withhim put in the moneyand had him mail ithimself, and I presumehis parents had the moneywhen President Woodwrote to President Young 
 Now for all the Excuse I have to offer, when I leftEngland I thought I couldgo to work on my returnhome and raise the moneyand send it back ina very short time, andI delayed writing thinkingI would have the cash tosend very soon, I beganwork the first week onmy return home in theshop I am a Blacksmithby trade, there was somefreighting going on ^to^ theFish Spring Mines Idone lots of work infixing up teams and soonhad over $100.00 owingme but I could not getthe money they put on more teams to haul Iworked hard and aboutthe last of October theythe owners of the Minessoop stoped the teamesfrom hauling and theboys were all in debt 
 for wagons and otherthings and the storestook all there pay andI have not got mymoney yet but havewaited and expected itevery month and failedto get it, I sold a mareharness & Wagon this springfor $150.00 trusting toget the money to pay offthose debts but havenot been able to collecta dollar in casth onit as yet, I have offereda mare and colt valuedat $20000. for $10000 inorder to pay the debt. I have also offered to sellmy water stock in theDeseret Irrigation Companyfor 50 cents on the dollarand cannot do so. I haveseveral hundred dollarsoweing me but cannotcollect unless I sue forit, and now I ammortgageing my hometo raise the money to 
 pay the amount I owewhich I amc determinedto do at an early date Ifeel heartly ashamed ofmyslef, the reason Ifailed to write to thoseparties was because Iexpected to have the moneyto send every money andI wanted to money to gowith the letters, but Iwill write and make mattersright and will send the money at an early dateI expect in a shorttime to have the moneyas I have applied for aloan on my home andhave the promise of itand am anxious to payevery dollar I owe Godbeing my helper, and Ibelieve I done some goodwhile on my mission andI have not lost the goodSpirit, and there is noharder wroker in thiswrard than myself

W. Woodruff& CounsellorsDear Brethren:Your favor 16thoct. received. I am grateful to you for Contents,and have failed to carry out your kind per-mission to close the printing in this officeperevious to Bro Andersons departure. Howeverwe have counselled over the situation tho-roughly, I believe, and have Concluded to shootup the press and let that ^work^ out first. Bro A. wasopposed to shutting up the composing loan; ^he^ thoughtwe could do better to keep it running for the present.I shall consider it thoroughly before I move contraryto his advise in this matter. I am strongly impressed to leave the building, and shall work with that endin view, as the Lord opens the way and the spiritintimates.I have called my son Albert into the office &also Bro. Callister. Albert has taken Bro. Cut-lers place. Wilby is here and has the spirit ofhis mission, we shall get on very well no doubt.The fog and rain, cold damp atmosphere, were tellingon me and I wanted my son near me. He is Competant 
 to fill the place I believe, for in advance of somewho have taken that department heretofore. BroCutler & Bro. Anderson have dwarfed their predecessors,and left a splendid record to guide their successors.It seems necessary to send a few more companies.Twenty souls, emigrants, and seven elders sailed onthe Arzona saturday. Another Company of eighteenemigrants and about seven elders will sailon the SS Nevada 5th prox. ^Wisconsin^ 22nd inst. Anothercompany will sail on the 5 of Nov. S.S. NevadaShall confine the numbers going on these vesselsto 25 souls or thereabouts. There are saints whowant to go later in Nov. perhaps a company onthe S.S. Arizona which sails on the 12th prox.If it is convenient will sail with my familyon that date for N. Y. I shall return on her ^Arizona^ sofar as I know at present unless otherwise instructedby you.The tithing of the mission has, through hard times,sunk to nothing. Fair prospects for converts in someplaces, considering the times. The elders are hopefuland have put in good work during the summer in out-door preaching.Mrs ^sister^ Esselman has sued Guion & Co. for goods destroyed ^by fdisinfecting on Wyoming N Y.^or threatened to do so. She had better sue the state. Mr. Rams-den much annoyed with this complaint for he was power-less to help it. I have assured him of my feelings on the subject.Love to the brethren in which we all joinYour Bro in Christ Brigham Young 
 42 Islington L.pool Eng.Aug 20th 1892.Prest Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City UtahDear Brother: I have no desire to increase your burdens, God knowsyou have enough to bear, but I have been muchexercised concerning a few points contained inBro. Roberts lecture ^which he^ delivered before the mMutual iIm-provement Ass[ociati]on on authority of Priesthood.I quote a few a fewseveral items which have cometo my mind, and in all that I say I desire to giveno offensce to my brethren in any particular. I cannot say there is one iota of untruth contained in thelecture, but in my judgement the lecturer does not ex-plain, sufficiently, points of vital importance. These ^points^have a double signifficance at this period of politicalexcitement; and ^the^ puting forth "liberal" ideas ^in political matters^ whichhave brought our Republic to the verge of desolution,and will ^yet^ prove an important factors in the ultimateoverthrow of man made governments, vis perfect freedomto lie debanch, the stronger oppress the weak, the rich growricher the poor grow poorer; the spirit shrinks and the bodyenlarge its beastly propensities, are distressing to contemplate.Please give mey ideas consideration and send me theadvice and counsel that is necessary to make ^me^ wise as a 
 serpent and harmless as a dove.I have always believed that, when when Christs author-ized servants had it revealed unto them that a certainman was the individual to preside over the church Hischurch, this might be sustained, but not revoked by His people.I have the privilege of showing to God and man that, I amin harmony with that revelation and my sign of cove-nant is the evidence, which I can produce on the spot,of my unswerving allegiance to Him. All things are done bycommon consent which comes through obedience to thehead."Joseph presided over the church by the voice of the people." Very true, and the people were the churchof Christ because they sustained His prophet, whichis equally true."Joseph presided over the church etc." "The people choseto have it so." "He always filled that station by the voiceof the people." These statements are all true, but I thinkthat, with^out^ further explenation they are calculated to mis-lead the minds of our children. If it is deemed wisdomto leave these things as they are as they appear in print, Iam content. Please render me a little assistance to putthe break on with a little more force."Eeclesiastical governments as well as civil derivetheir just powers from the consent of the governed." I am in-clined to think that, there is a destinction between h the ^two^ govern-ments, God calls and authorizes a man, he gathers the peopleand they sustain him. Men gather and appoint ^or elect^ theirhead. One originates in God, the other in man. 
 In comparison, God has a fine stepper properly harnessedto his ^beautifuly proportioned vehiacle^ to bear the burthen; while man has nothing buta push cart. True, majorities controle in the world &they ^the wicked^ will seek to push this doctrine upon us, on purposeto destroy the church. I know their cunning is not equal tothe wisdom of God, and I pray for strength to stand whenthese two powers will, apparently, so nearly tie that the boldestwill tremble in the conflict. A bare majority of the people mayreject the prophets of God and by their votes sustain men more con-genial to their tastes, but in doing this they cut out the only receivingoffice on the line through which revelation can come to them. The mai-jnority who sustain the prophet by their votes, are all that is left of thechurch of Christ.The agency of man consists in his having ^had^ power delegatedto him to select his master. I exercise my will power by beingobedient to the chosen of the Lord. I believe our youth should betaught to sustain the authorities of the church irrespective ofof numbers. I fix my eyes upon you; I listen to your counsel,I try to live to have the same spirit that actuates you. The testimony ofthe spirit in one is that, your mistakes should you make any will beoverruled by God for His glory and the good of His people. I beseechthe Father to give me strength to follow you as you follow Christ our Lord.Will the time ever come when a majority of those claiming mem-bership in the church whatever object they have had in joining thechurch will reject the Presidency and Apostles by vote in the generalassembly of the people. I beleive the devil has that little game on foot that is, the idea, exists in the hearts of men today.I am content to leave things as they are for now I feel better. If Ihave hurt your feelings in any wise forgive me. I could not rest until I hadchatted with the presidency.I strive to do my duty in my weak way. In contrast with the brightnessof the more youthful elders, there is much of the old fogy in me I find.Love to the brethren. God bless you dear brotherI am your^s^ in ChristBrigham Young

Cannon andJoseph F. Smith; Dear Brethren:Your cable received andit met our hearty endorsment. Our next company sailson the S.S. Alaska 1st prox, and numbers about thirty (30)souls: This is the last company we shall send until thingslook more favourable. We expect the "Arizona" to sail onthe 15th prox. and she will carry a number of our elders,Bro. Jas H. Anderson among them. We shall welcomeBro. Dougall and trust that he is all sufficient tofill the place on the Star, vacated by Bro. Anderson.We could not expect him to be as efficient as Bro. Jas. inevery department: he must live many years and improveevery moment of his time in order to reach the plane ofintelligence to which Bro. Anderson has attained. I tell youbrethren I am a mere babe in current intelligence: andI believe that it needs a much more intelligent manthan myself to carry on this business successfully that iskeep the mission and the Star up to their present status.I beg of you brethren to send as many missionaries this fall as you convieniently can. I wish we had two hun-dred more men in the field. True we do not makemany converts, but what we are doing requires morehelp. The neglected districts containing millions of 
 people who are ripe for salvation, or damnation,where the labors of efficient elders are greatly needed,may be counted by the score; the conference Presidentsappeal to me in vain for more help. If agreeable toyou and circumstances favour it, I shall send my family home sometime before Christmas: and if youare willing, shall cross the water to N.Y. with themproviding it will cost nothing for me to go and return.My wife is timid and will hardly be willing to sailwithout me. She could remain in a warm climate,which would cost money: but funds are scarcewith all parties at present. Bro. Cutler and I visitedMr Ramsden today: our interview was very satisfactory.I informed him it was doubtful about our sendingany more emigrants after the 1st prox. until we knewmore definitely concerning actions of those whipper-snapperson the other side of the Atlantic. He agreed with usit would be unwise to send companies of emigrants,especially in consideration of the action taken in relationto the intermediate passengers on S. S. Pavonia, Cunard line.The Wisconsin and Arizona are now on the water carrying companiesof our people in 2nd cabin, who may be treated the same asthe Pavonia people vis. quarintined for three weeks. Yourfavour, 9th inst., pertaining to Bro. Dougall just received: Ithank you much for the official information and with thehelp of God we shall succeed in our duties so longas we are relegated to this land. My health has beenprecarious: the back part of my head occassioning mepain and trouble: but I am much better now. Themission is prosperous and all well.

W. Musser a few days since datedHaifa, Palestine Sept 6th 1892 in which he says heand Elder Adolf Haag arrived there on August 31stby way of Alexandria Port Said and Jappa. Thereare but two members of the Church at Haifa.Bro Grau and Sister Tegel, the latter an old lady whowas desirous of donating 100000 franks for the TurkishMission, and had paid him 500 franks of the amount.He states that since arriving in Turkey Bro Haagshealth has not been good, and the day before he wrotewhich would be Sept 5th he complained of notfeeling quite well and so went and laid down.In about an hour he awoke burning up with fever,in a few moments he was so weak he could hardlysit up and his heart was very much affected, andfor a time Bro Musser was very much alarmed. Headministered to him, and his heart became better buthis fever was alarmingly high, he doctered him as besthe could all day but about 3 oclock in the morningbe became worse. They gave him a good sweatingand when he woke he appeared to be better and was 
 resting niceley. and they felt confident the Lord wouldspare him to complete his mission and let himreturn to his loved onces in Zion, he thought itwould be unwise to keep him in Turkey andthought the climate of Germany or Switzerlandwould suit him better, and I intendedmaking the change, but it was not to be, forthe next news that I received was a Telegramfrom Bro Musser dated Haifa 8 pm receivedlast night saying "Elder Haag is dead"signed "Muszer," which I presume is intendedfor Musser.Elder Haag arrived hereMarch 15th having left his home at PaysonFeby 18 [18]92, he labored in the Swiss & GermanMission until the beginning of July, when hestarted for the Turkish Mission. We shallanxiously await Bro Mussers letters withdetails and will on their arrival immediatelywrite you.

 yet some orchards will bear a middling crop some veryfine apples in the orchards.President Young's apple trees are some of themloaded, and a good crop of peaches; his grape vines areloaded, I think he will have 2 or 3000 lbs of grapes this season.It is a general time of health in this Territory except a company that came in from the Mississippi brought the small pox with them, but it has not spread much yet, andwe hope it will not.A company arrived from Carson Valley on the 28thinst, they report that Murray, who was tried for murderlast winter was killed by the Indians, also a man by the name of Reddin.Your family are all well. Brothers Bates and LukeJohnson are about to start on a Mission of about one month, with Seth M. Blair to Ruby Valley on an exploring expedition to open a new route to Carson Valley. They expectto meet bro Enoch Reese with a company from Carson to cooperate with them.Our Agricultural and Manufacturing Society aremaking quite an exertion to promote Home Manufacturesin this Territory, as the time has come when we see that weare under the necessity of making in a great measure what we use. The various Wards of the City and Territory areforming auxiliary branches of the same; intending to Manu-facture all they can for home consumption.During this month Elder Parley P. Pratt and a 
 opposite Prest. Young's buildings.On the 29th Ulto we had a general muster and inspectionof the Nauvoo Legion. Lieut. Gen. Wells and his staff received thetroops, after which a hollow square was formed and the Lieut. Gen. delivered an animating address to the troops, which was well sustainedby the officers of his staff and chaplain.We have had much excellent preaching lately by the FirstPresidency and others. Prest. Young has come out boldly and told thispeople in the name of the Lord, they must repent and be baptizedfor the remission of their sins. Several Wards have gone forwarden masse been baptized and renewed their covenants before the Lord,and I believe the fire of a universal reformation in this Territoryhas been lit and will continue to burn, until a permanentfoundation for good works has been laid in our midst. We must say since the organization of this church our ears have never beensaluted with more pointed Godlike sermons, than have flowed latelyfrom Prest. Young and his counsellors.We are happy to announce the arrival of Elders F. D.Richards, Daniel Spencer, Jos. A. Young W. H. Kimball Geo. D. Grant, James Ferguson, John Van Cott, C. H. Wheelock, N. H. Felt,Wm. C. Dunbar, J. T. D. McAlister & James McGaw.yours trulyW Woodruff 
 On the 31st October, brother Gideon D. Gibbs and HoraceNewell arrived from Elder Willie's hand cart coy., whom they left onthe sweetwater, when the teams sent out at conference arrived atthis camp, there had been twenty deaths, nineteen of them men.and while with them in one day there were fifteen burials, and whenthe messengers left there had been fifty deaths. They did not seemto be sick, but chilled through, men would dig graves for theirbrethren, and before night would die themselves. They had distributed their last rations of Flour the night before the brethren met themand they did not know that any relief was at hand.The reason of this difficulty and suffering [ink faded] with theemigration is in consequence of the companies starting so late, and the early falling of snow in the mountains. Prest. Young hasuniversally given counsel for the emigration to start early.The hand cart companies who started early came in well indeedbetter than the most sanguine could have expected.yours truly,W.

 [sideways text] W. WoodruffRecd April 30And May 41880 [end of sideways text]Salt Lake City.12th April 1880.John W. Young.Dear Brother,This is the first min-ute I have attempted to write to any man in Arizona since my arrival. I have been so overwhelmed with confer-ences, Meetings, councils and callers. But now to business: First I will say that I have sent you a letter containing the account of your matters at the Ferry. I do not know whether you obtained it or not. I found your a/c at the Ferry as follows: Your Order last drawn $222 30/100; private a/c $47 75/100 and W. Freeman's ferriage, they said run by your order $41 75/100 total $31180. Total Receipts of the Ferry while in the hands of Fouts $178500 one third for the Church=$59500 $31180 leaves $28320 $6000 out for Mrs Lee leaves $223 20/100 which was in the hands of Fouts when you settled with him un-less there is something else due him in your settlement with him. What accounts you have sent concerning the Ferry is in the hands of the Auditing Committee, which I have not yet had time to discuss with the Comm. I looked over your list; I see you had put in your wagon to be credited in your a/c $15000, so at this time I do not know whether the 60 bus. of Grain could be allowed on that a/c. or not. I took your letter to Eldridge concerning Mdse and he said that last year, you agreed to send your wool to them to dispose of, until they got their pay, but 
 said you had put your wool in the hands of Libby to sell and she had sold it and pocketed $150000 of the money and gone to Philuadelphia. I do not think they feel disposed to advance any- thing more. I understand they foreclosed mortgage on your property, and have taken posssession of it. One of the Committee remarked to me, that you borrowed $50000 of the Church before you left and was to pay in wool, but they had not got it. As soon as the Comm. can get to it, they will look over your a/cs. and do what they can with them. I saw your Mother and had quite a talk with her. She said Libby had sold your Library before she left. Your Mother was as well as usual. I had a talk with Brigham. He said he had got an a/c of the wool he had sold; had paid for it all I think in Orders. He said [blank space] had written you several times but had received no answer. I told them I thought it was in consequence of the mails. Sr Van Cott called upon me, enquired about Lula.I saw her mother to-day. She said she was looking for Lula to come home on a visit. We had an excellent conference; a good spirit prevailed; a large attendance. In the organization of the Young Men's M. I. AssnW. Woodruff was appointed the Supt., Moses Thatcher & Jos. F. Smith counselors. I find my family well as usual, but I have hardly had time to look one of them in the face. I received a telegram from you from Albuquerque, which we answered. I saw a letter to the Council in which you said, that you had more missionaries than you wanted to hold the claims, and was sending some into the vineyard. I shall be glad to hear from you at any time. Direct to Salt Lake. Your Brother in the GospelW WoodruffRemember me Kindly to Lula 
 Salt Lake City, May 2, 1882.Brother John W. Young.I write to say that your letter of April 26 has just arrived, and been read to President Taylor, and the following quotation is his view in relation to the subject of which you speak "Arrangements are now being made, looking to the settlement of some of our people in Mexico, and general instructions given to certain parties in this matter. I would not feel at liberty to recommend anything that would, in any way, directly or indirectly, interfere with those affairs."Your mother is still very low. We have buried Brother Joseph L. Barfoot, who died very suddenly. Brother Jacob Gibson died last night at Sugar House Ward. Bishop Sperry lost another child yesterday. John Pack is very low,as also is your mother. The Presidency and Twelve and families are as well as usual. But there is still consid-erable sickness among children. Remember me kindly to your family and all inquiring friends.Your brother in the Gospel.W. Woodruff.

 Salt Lake City, April 20, 1880.Mr. John W. Young.Dear Brother, I have just received your letter this morning, and I will say that I think it is all right and would be a good thing if the brethren could take contracts on the railroad, to help them-selves so that they could get bread and means. I would like to know where the railroad is coming. Concern-ing the telegram I will say that Prest. Taylor's views were that the Presidents of Stakes should have an oversight over the Co-op. stores and contracts on the railroad. I sent you a letter on the 12th of April in a letter to Lot Smith, in which I gavean account of matters up to that date, which I hope you got.Brother William Peterson called on me this morning, in-quiring about you and your affairs. 
 He said he had a bill against you for beef, a bill of $369, drawn by Libby and others of your family, which he said that you had promised to pay, and Libby had promised to pay him, and she had gone off without paying a cent, and he felt bad about it and wanted his money. Of course I could do nothing for him in the matter. I think it would be well for you to write to him about it. Since I came home I am satisfied that Tout is the man that got out an indict-ment against our friend in Arizona. I got a letter from Brother Hatch, say-ing that Brother Tenney had sent somebody to borrow 100 head of cows of Brother Flake to pay for St. John. But we think the people who have gone there should do what they can to help raise the means to help pay for it. Then I shall send to the Presidents 
 Salt lake City, May 26, 1881.Elder John W. Young.Dear Brother, After parting with you last night, I went into the office this morning and examined all of my files of letters to you and Brother A. M. Tenney. I find copies of six to A. M. Tenney and four to you, and I read them all thoroughly through, for I have copies of all my letters both to him and you. I wanted to see what I had written to him which cast such reflections upon you to cause you grief, and I failed to find anything in any of them to cast reflections on you.You seemed to feel grieved that I had not written to you.I have copies of letters which I wrote to you April 20, May 6 and 27, and June 14, 1880, and I have only received two from you 
 and bishops to get together what ti-thing stock there is in the different settlements and use it as a loan to pay on the purchase until it can be secured. You ask me for coun-sel. My counsel would be concern-ing your temporal affairs, not to involve yourself, any more than you can possibly help, in debt, and write to those whom you owe and have promised to pay, and give them an explanation and tell them what you can do and what you cannot, for when we promise and do not fulfil it creates hard feelings, as I saw was the case with Brother Peterson this morning.As you say, so say I, that I am so full of councils, meetings, and business that I have hardly time to write to anybody.Remember me kindly to Lula 
 and all my friends with you.I do not know when this will reach you.Your brother in the Gospel, W Woodruffanswered May 31 [18]8075+125+67=267

 Salt Lake City, May 6,1880.Mr. J. W. Young.Dear Brother Fifteen days agoI wrote you a letter and supposed itwas forwarded to you at Sunset in LotSmith's letter. Today I found it inmy drawer, and as I want to writeyou some more today, I will put themboth together and send them in a letterto Lot Smith. I will send inthis a copy of your account, and I willsay that I laid your case before thecouncil concerning your expenses infeeding the Indians. I got $549.43appropriated for that purpose, but theywished it understood that it was notto set a precedent for future action.The Naylor brothers have madesome inquiry concerning your af-fairs, saying that you owed them 
 for wagons, but I could give noinformation what your calculationswere about it.The appropriation the Councilmade just settles your account,except your note of $15.00. In yourletter to President Taylor, you askedif they would take yarn for pay.You can pay it all in yarn if youwish.I have just seen Lulu's mother.She said she had got a letter fromher, and she said she was goingto return to Moan Coppy soon.I shall request Lot to forwardthis to you the first opportunity.My respects to her and the Saintswith you. I think M. Thatcherwill soon return to Mexico.The council are well asusual. I am enjoying fairhealth.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.P. O. BOX B.Salt Lake U. T 27 Dec. 1888Prest. W. Woodruff,Dear Brother:Elder F. D. Richards desires me to present the following for your consideration.Some short time ago Elder Frederick Allisback of Payson was notified to take a mission to Germany, to leave here on 9th of Next April.  He replied to you saying he would be ready.  At that time his Bishop had promised him, so he states, to take care of his family during his absence.  He has since called upon Bro. Richards and states that the Bishop has now told him he cannot help his family while he is absent.  Bro. Allisback is quite a poor man, and wishes to know what he is to do, as he cannot do anything towards leaving his family any supplies.  Most of the German brethren called are poor men. 
 Rec'd Dec 17 [18]88 and Ans'd  [Dec]  28 [1888]I believe that more Elders have been called from Payson during the past two years than from any other place of its size, and probably the bishop feels he has too heavy a load to carry.Respectfully, Your Brother Geo Reynolds

Wilford Woodruff,Dear Bro. :I sent telegram to Elder Geo. Reynolds to-day in rela-tion to the case of Bro. Sylvanus C. Hulet, Jr. who had been called as a missionary to the North-western States, and subsequently released.Bro. Hulet came in, and showed me your letter containing his release.He had made almost ready to start when the time should arrive, and expectednothing else, and he would now rather go on this mission if you so wish it, but is willing to labor where you feel best to 
 place himHe is young and vigorous; has but a small family; is in fair circumstan-ces; is exemplary in all his habits; and, I think, would make an efficient worker in the missionary field.The affairs of the bishopric can be provided for in a safe way until such time as you may send some one to look after those matters in this stake.In view of a step in contemplation, we both feel it would be wise to yet call him unless you are impressed to the con-trary.Please telegraph answer on receipt of this, and I will forward to him.Your brother in the GospelMorgan Richards, Jr.
