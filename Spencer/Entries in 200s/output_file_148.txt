 W. Woodruff spoke of the importance of sustaining the Agricultural Society, the interest of that Society, like the Kingdom of God, must live, and the Bishops being called and or- dained by the servants of the Living God, to look after the Temporal things of the Kingdom; He dwelt particularly on the present crisis, which should stimulate every one to take an increased interest in sustaining ourselves. He refer d to the Hand of God which has been so visible, that every one living in the line of his duty cannot fail to see.  Being lately called to take the Presidency of that Society, he desired to have the co- operation of the Bishops, by laying this important subject before the members of their respective wards, and endeavour to prevail upon every male member to become an annual subscriber, which only amounted to 1/2 a Bushel of wheat. He said it was the intention of the Board to build a good House, and cultivate land for the growth of choice Fruits &c as soon as funds would enable them to do so, they have just completed a Premium List, and though out funds, they are acting on a principle of Faith, and intend to offer every encouragement by way of stimulating the Brethren on this important subject; He spoke of a time when we should be thrown entirely upon our own resources from recent dis patches, and it behoves us to be awake and energetic, and the Lord will bless us. 
 Wilford Woodruff, being present, remarked, that as the time for holding our Annual Fair was at hand, he wished the Bps of the several wards to appoint persons to deliver public addresses in each ward, on the subject of holding the Fair, and encourage the people to bring specimens of their workmanship in cloth, and other products of their skill and industry. 
 Elder Wilford Wilford, entirely coincided with the previous remarks   we have men in our midst who would sell the Kingdom, their Houses, Farms, anything else that will strengthen the hands of our enemies, let us therefore one and all walk up to our duties, that are now required of us, and back up our Bishops, the Mayor &c 
 Elder W. Woodruff said many of our children were being sent to outside schools, who deny new revelation, and many other principles of the Gospel, he opposed it in his feelings, and would not do it himself. We ought to sustain our own Teachers who are in full faith and fellowship with us. There are many dead branches which must sooner or later be cut off, for they neither go to meeting nor pray, but can swear, get drunk &c.  The Lessor Priesthood should be organized in every ward to act in their lot and place, no man should feel himself so high as to refuse to act in that priesthood.  He then spoke of the respect that Joseph Smith the Prophet entertained towards the Teachers and submitted to a severe criticism by the first Teacher that ever entered his house.  The Bishops held very responsible positions, and he felt to encourage them to be faithful for God required it at their hands.  If we only become united as a people before God, no power can ever harm the anointed of God. We have no time to waste, but let us be up and do our duty, act as Patriarchs over our own house, for it was painful to see our young people growing up in Infidelity, and give themselves up to all kinds of wickedness.  We had more faith in the prayers of ten righteous men, than in all the big guns on the face of the earth, Prest Young and George Q Cannon were instances of deliverance, as the result of faith and prayer. 
 Elder W. Woodruff was pleased with the representation of the Bishops to night, the blessing  of the Lord will rest upon the Missionaries who go in the right spirit.  He suggested that a Surgeon and Midwife should go along, and that all the company  operate in one common interest, carrying out the principle of the united order; and  work for each other. 
 Randolph Rich Co May 31, 1874  Dear Brother Brigham  I write to say that  we have organized Evry Branch in this  Stake of Zion in the United Order except one,  had a good time, much of the Spirit of the Lord  with us. Most of the people receive it.  My object in writing at this time is to say  to you that Brothers Rich, Budge, & myself  visited Soda Spring Branch, & preached to what  people there was there of the Saints but did  not organize Because the president & most  of the leading men of that Branch of the Church  were gone from home, butht most of those who  were present voted to join the order, and  on[e] that is in your jurisdiction I thought  perhaps you could visit them and organize  them by sending an appointment so they could be  at home. We have held 23 Meeting and organize  11 Branches of the United Order. I expect to  start for Salt Lake City in few days, shall  Meet the Saints at Almy on my return  Your Brother in the Gospel  W.

Dear Brethern:  I am thankful for the privilege of writing to you on this auspicious day. Deeply grateful am I for the tidings of what will transfire in our loved mountain home on this the sixty second anniversary of the establishing of the church of Christ in the earth. God is merciful to His people, we live to behold a day that I did not whope would transpire within the limited span allotted time on earth.  Brethren of the Presidency and Twelve, I join you in spirit this day during your celebratiansand offerings unto God. When a boy, I rejoiced during the services of laying the capstone on the Temple at Nauvoo; as a man, I worship the Being who has brought about this great triumph to the saints; here is demonstrated their skill perseverance and industry, a blended monument of the zeal and integority of the people, a thing of beauty and a joy forever. Your own feelings will tell you how joyfully I would join you ^on^ this oc casion, but under the circumstances I could not hope or expect to attend these celebrations which precede the most complete dedicatory cerimonies which I trust are not far distant  Although far distant from the stiring scenes which have transried among you during the last ninteen months, yet I have been with you in spirit and sustained ^you^ with my prayers before the Lord. It was not difficult for one to understand the various mover which have been made and I approved of the "Manifesto" proclamations etc which have ^been^ insued by the Presidency and Twelve, unto the saints. In all these mutatitions but once have I felt the solid ground move under my feet, and that was long ago when the elders maintained that the "manifesto" not only abrogated all plural marriages but ^also^ ad- vised the brethren to break up their plural families and discard, seperate from, ignore those women who were wives anterior to the ^passage of those^ vile ^ants^ polygamy laws, as well as later marriages. 
 I have laid these matters away, and concluded it will be time enough across that bridge when I reach it. The business which devolves upon me with furnish awhile employment while I am in this land and I trust in God for all future exigencies. Perhaps more will be known in relation to the sitriahan after the anvesty is pro- I caimed, than is dreamed of now. One thing, in relations to my present feelings, is quite clear. I would rather live without all my wives, entirely seper- ate from them, than to live exclusively with any one of my wives. While I hold these feelings yet they are now and with Gods help my whole being shall be subject to "thus saith the Lord".  I am but poorly in health, and in fact all of the brethren in the office are loosing their energy, but we are still able to keep things moving and I am improving so are the brethren I believe. Summer is coming and we all feel a sensation of returning health. I am quite sure the climate here is changing for the worse and occasionally Englishmen express themselves as being & disgusted with the climate.  We left New Brighton and now occupy a house near Princes Park at a rent of two hundred dollars per year. Have used some money to purchase necessary articles for keeping house. There were a few things at 42 we could use but most everything there would not bear transportion, too old and broken. Will ^soon^ send the amount used and if you do not choose to allow it I will pay it.  Of course I do not know how you are pleased with our administration but I am well pleased with the way we are getting on.  Please send us a good writer for sub-editor and a first class printer. We are dependant on Union people,   Mr. Davis having left us   and these are hard men who calculate to get pay without much work. Bro. Anderson ought to be released as early as September ^if not before^ and the man who suceeds him ought to have experience in the field before he comes into the office.  God bless you my dear brethren with love in which the brethren and Mrs. Y. join  Your Bro in Christ  Brigham Young 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42, Islington, Liverpool. May 6th 1892  Presidents W Woodruff G Q Cannon Jos F Smith  Dear Brethren:  The proposition to detain Bro. Osmond to repace Bro. Anderson is impracticable for the following reasons. Bro. Osmond was here on mission two years from 1884 to 1886. He came here year last Jan. it will be two years next Jan. His health is much impared, His financial condition at home is embarassing, and under these circumstances I have arranged to release him in the near future. I presume you will look upon his case as I do. He is willing to stay, but another winter here would prove fatal to him ^I believe^; within the last three months he has been at deaths door; he now presides in London.  I have spent some forty pounds for house furniture the bills for most of it I forward you have no bills for the ten pounds Furniture etc at 42 would not bear transportation the brethren use that which we left that which is good for anything. I will pay these bills should ^you^ intimate it is my business to do so. Have taken my family notraveling to improve the health of my wife and children who have been seriously afflicted at times, hence the great expense to me. Bro. Anderson is gradually failing in health so are most of the brethren who sleep at 42; business makes it necessary for them to do so. Printers earn their wages by shirking, must be watched closely.  My brethren & family join in love  Your Bro in Christ.  Brigham Young

 [sideways text] Brigham Young March 9, [18]92 [end of sideways text]  LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42 Islington, Liverpool.  March 9th 1892  Prest. Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother: Your favor Feb. 15th came to hand and was perused with uncommon interest and I will answer you according to the light that is in me. First, we thank you for your kind invi- tation to attend the aniversary of your birth day Heaven has favored you and I thank God you are recovered from your recent illness and for the presservation of your life to comfort the saints and your family. I will sug- gest that your next invatation anti date your birth day, time enough ^for us^ to joni you, especially should you consider our presence necessary rather desiriable.  Curiosity I believe is the mainspring that has brought strangers to our meetings, and I believe that, curiosity is waning; for all over the mission with about three exceptions the people feel in the districts where our people elders labor, that a mormon elder, with his gospel is a nuissance. The people do not want the gospel and while we do batptize a few not one proselyte to each elder in the year. Still it is a fact that, the elders meet with but little but abuse. We are warning the people and ^doing^ but little else. I have felt to put a force in here this nation, that, the people will be left without excuse, I have found not one case where the distribution of tracts has brought one soul to our meetings or into the Church. 
 So far as emigration matters are concerned, the english por- tion is rather insignificant, what ^emigrants^ there are could ship at southhampton joining german steamer at that point which could bring our Scandinavian emigration better than there present method of Conveyance, in my opinion. But this is a matter that with your permission I will examine into more particularly, not with a view of doing anything but for information pending future events.  President Woodruff, this mission is a dead beet so far as proselyting is concerned. My whole anxiety has been to warn the people, outside of that, the mission is shurnken to an insig- nificant compass. We hire halls and but few come; I am afraid there is culpable neglect on the part of the saints, many have to be nursed and ^for the elder^ to leave them the saints to break new ground many become cold indifferent and must have a frequent application of gospel warming pan, and I have known cases when it was impossi- ble to resussitate them. Our batteries are too light metal, the Lord can turn their ^the peoples^ indifference to interest, but we cannot.  Prest Saml Thurman, London, reports some interest among strangers there but it is comparatively little; one of the elders had been laboring for two months and thought if he could be left in that vicinity for a few weeks longer he could make one or two converts. We have to contend with supreme indifference of the people, or abuse. Your son-in-law is about correct. I am not discouraged and we have many conferences to attend within the next two months.  I could give you more detailes but these are facts as I understand the situation.  God bless you with long life future Love to brethren, in which the brethren join.

Dear Brother:  The changed conditions in the Church educational system have rendered it desirable, in the opinion of the First Presidency and the members of the Boards of Young University and the Latter-day Saints College, of Salt Lake City, that these two institutions of learning should be consolidated, and to preserve the name of President Brigham Young it is suggested that the new establishment be known as Young Institute. It is thought the best interests of the school will be subserved by greatly reducing the number of members of the Board (say to seven); as at present it is next to impossible to get together a sufficient number to form a quorum. Under these circumstances it will be necessary for the greater portion of the members of the board of Young University to resign. We ourselves have each of us already tendered our resignation, and we write this to you to ask if you have any objections to resigning also. If you have not, will you be so kind as to forward your resignation to the President of the Board of Young University George Q. Cannon.  Respectfully your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. Smith

City  Dec 15 1865  President Brigham Young jr  Dear Brother  Having forwarded you a few lines several Days since, & promising to write you the first oppertunity, I now feel to redeem my- pledge. I have not been a disinterested observer, or an Idle spectator of your labors in Europe since your appointment to the presiding in that important station although I have been silent with my pen I travelled through England & Scotland Twenty five years ago with your Father & others to esstablish the work of God in that Land. The Lord Blessed us & we were successful we Baptized some 7000 souls into the Church of Christ during the year 1840, & laid the foundation for the spread of the Gospel in those foreign countries which has increased more or less up to the present time, I have felt deeply interested in the progress of the work from the commensment And Esspecially when I see our sons the sons of the prophets & Apostles & Fathers even the seconed generation, steping forth to help bear the [burthen] of the Kingdom of God, I feel to Bless them with every feelings of my soul, I feel to pray for them day & Night And they have the prayers of all the faithful dIn the Kingdom of God. I rejoice to see you filling the High & responsible stations in which 
 you are placed, The Lord never called men in any age of the world to perform a greater work than we are called to do in our day & generation The Lord has decreed to esstablish his Kingdom upon the Earth in the Last days to be thrown down no more forever and he has put this work into our hands to do therefore let us be faithful & work while the day lasts for soon the night will come when no man can work. I have been much pleased to hear of the progress of the work under your presiding. I receive frequent Litter from Wilford & from others all give a good Account of you. Concerning matters with us I will say it is a [g'eneral] time of health with us your Father passed through a very severe sick turn a short time since, the sickest time he has ever had in these Mountains but has fully recovered, we are again setting in a Legistor time capasity and are getting along very well  we have received Gov. Durkee's Message which is quite harmless We are having quite a peaceful time in our City notwithstanding the Armey in our midst they have no power Judge Titus has gone to Washington to try to stir up strife but he will not prevail God is at the helm & he will guide the ship. Bishop Kesler & H. S. Eldridge both were thrown from their buggy by a run away Horse Eldridge was badly brused but no bons broaken is geetting better Kesler brooke his thigh clere to the hip is bad off. You of course have heard 
 of the accident of Brother Mousley in New Jersy being mas- hed up in a rail car I have not heared from him of late do not know whether he will live or die. I was sorry to hear of the drowning of Elder Sims in the platt All the Emigration got in before very cold weather we had a very pleasent Nov but very cold Dec. wheat & flour ran down low this fall, but is rising again. I expect you will have a large Emigration next season as it is decided to send 500 teams to assest the Emigration The Bishops are very busy though the Territory in geting out polls & setting them to prepare next season for a Telegraph line from St Charles to St George. All of the Twelve are in the Legislation this winter Except O Pratt who is with you in the vineyard 9 of whom are in the council, we have not got far enough into the work of the Session to know what we shall perform during our siting your Brother Joseph A. is sitting near me drawing out an Act to incorperate the wasatch waggon road Company An Act for this purpose was passed last session but vetoed by the Governor. We have had a good deal of Difficulty with a small band of Band Indians under Black Hawk during the fall in Sanpete Co & joining settlements but I hope it may not last much longer The presiding & Twelve & their families are all well as far as I know also your own families I should be pleased to hear from you at any time That the Blessings of God may rest upon you and all your companions with Ministry in all your Labors is the daily ^prayer^ of  W.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,  Salt Lake City, Utah, June 29, 1888.  Elder Brigham Young,  Dear Brother:  Your brief letter of the 17th has just reached  me. I am not surprised to hear from you of the fatigue and lameness which you feel  in consequence of the hard trip that you have taken. You have passed through a very  rough country, and if you have had many miles of road to make you have had a tedious  time.  There is nothing particularly new since I last  wrote to you, excepting that we are still progressing somewhat in our attempt to aef- fect a settlement of the Church suit; but as we progress the hunger of the officers  seems to increase. A comparison was made to us by a man not of our faith that they  reminded him of wolves sitting and licking their chops, waiting for their prey. Their  eyes glare at the mention of property with the same eagerness and hunger that wild  animals have when they scent their prey. But the Council has decided that we had  better do everything we can to effect a settlement, even if it takes all the property  that they claim. We would liked you to have been with us to have given us your views  upon the subject. It wis with great reluctance that we do this the same reluctance  with which we have yielded our property in days past, when armed mobs have stood 
 around and driven us from our homes and taken possession of that which the Lord had  given to us. But this will stop these painful proceedings before the Examiner, and  will perhaps be the means of saving our temples and meeting-houses and sacred places  from direct attacks, if it does not savie them entirely; at least, we hope so. The case  of course, will be carried up to the court of last resort for its decision.  My health and the health of the brethren general- ly is good. Brother Grant has not been well; but has been able to attend our two last  Councils. Yourself and Brothers Thatcher and Teasdale are the only ones absent now  of the Quorum. With love and praying the Lord to bless you and preserve you from every  evil, in which Brothers Geo. Q. and Jos. F. join,  I remain,  Your Brother,  Wilford Woodruff

 L. D. S. Historian's Office,  P. O. Box 321,  Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3 1887  Dear Brother Brigham  Your Welcome Letter of April  19 is received and I was very glad to hear  from you. I was vary much pleased with  the spirit of your Letter Now with regard to  Brother Tenney, I will say I did not know  that He had any Appointment by any bady One Except the Mission I gave him to the  Zonies, Lagoonies, Islata &c. while I was in that  country He done Nothing in the Mission after  the Rail Roading commenced And after He  came out of prision and broke down financia- lly and in spirit & health We could not Expect  him to do much at Missionary Work at present  But in coresspondence with the presidency we  have thought it Wisdom to Esstablish a  mission with the Maricopas, Pemos Papagoes and  then reach the Yaquis but not to begin with the Yaquis first. And having travelled with Tenney  and knowing that He could preach Well in spanish  I thought He would make one good hand with  a company of 4 or 6 as the case might be to Engage  in that Mission He might not be a suitable  man to Lead in it I have written to him upon  the subject and it would Meet his Mind to Engage 
 in that Mission. I did not know that he had  Labored among the Navajos or had a Mission  to them. He helped Baptise 115 Zunies and  Labored some 6 months with the Islata I am  Satisfied Brother Brigham that as the Gentilses  are so fast and so thoroughly rejecting the  Gospel that it is our Duty to more thorou- ghly commence to Esstablish Missionary Stations among the Lamanite throughout  this Western world. Now of course I do not  know what instructions you have received from  the presidency concerning your Mission or to what  Extent But as the Navajos Join on to those  Northern tribes I should think that you  ought to have the oversight of the Oribas  Moquis, Zonies Lagoonies & Islata. The Islata are a very rich intelegant indostrios people, ther  City Numbers 3 or 4000 They are 12 Miles below  Albukirke you have probably been there They have  vary rich vineyards orchards & fields. John  King was ther old patriark when we was there,  We held 2 Meetings with the Lagoonies and the  Govorner & spiritual Adviser went with us to  Islata and staid with us while there, where  We Returned they went up the River but said they  would be back as soon as we did, but they did  not come If they had been there we should  have baptized the whole village and there has  been No preaching there since to my knowledge 
 L. D. S. Historian's Office,  P. O. Box 321,  Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3, 1887  [written in pink ink] I will now say according to my view it is of  but Little use to baptize the Lamanites  and then go and Leave them without any guide They should be organized and some judicious  Elder apointed to Labor with them and teach  them both by precept & Example, before they can  be qualified to Live as Latter Day Saints, and  we shall have to adopt that policy Hereafter  as far as we can  [written in black ink] I gave Brother Milton S. Ray  a Mission a good while ago to preach to the  Maricopas and Esstablish a school among them  which He has done and I understand thye the  children are learning fast. Brother Ray is  now in Salt Lake City He took his wife  there because she was sick his Location  is in Messa City but it is so hot there  the Sisters can hardly Live. My Daughter  Bell Moses has come home to her Mothers  in Smithfield with her children she is  almost Dead with the Heat. Brother Moses is  calculating to sell out and come North  in consequence of the Sickness of his Wife  If we Esstablished a Mission among these South- ern tribes I did not Expect they would get at 
 ^it^ untill fall, and my view was for them to  commence with the Maricopas and Pimas located  on Salt River and work South through the  Papagoes and others untill they Reach the  Yaquis. It will be a good while before they would  reach the Yaquis. Of course we want all the  Wisdom we can get to carry out these Missions  Missions among the Lamanites. I admire  your views very much to get the permit  approbations & all the assistance we can from  the Authorities of Mexico, to assist us  in so imporant an undertaking. Of course  we want Men who can speak spanish to  Engage in those Missions There should not  be less that 4 to go upon that Mission  so when they seperate there can be two together  [written in pink ink] I had a few names in my Mind which I think I sent to president Taylor for his  Approval ^Big^ T. W. Brookbank A M Tenney, J P J  Christofferson one Stewart at Kanab And a young Man  whose Mother a Widow ^Greer^ at the Meadows I have not the  two last names before me  [written in black ink] I would Like your  views Brother Brigham in this Matter what  would you think of Brother Brookbank as  a Leader and Tenney & Stewart as counsellers  I am Well acquainted with Brother Brookbank  I should think He would make a good Leader  [written in pink ink] I was sorry the Mexicans killed Cajeme the Yaqui Chief  [written in black ink] Have the Mexicans taken possession of ther Land 
 L. D. S. Historian's Office,  P. O. Box 321,  Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3 1887  Now I have got through speaking of the mission  I will write of sumthing Els. Of course I would would be pleased to be With you and take  a Hunt in the Mountains, but I Expect I  would tire out rather rather sooner than I used  to. I am in good health & spirits, but I got  tired out in half a days tramp I am today  where you left me. I take the same boat and  go & get and get a few ducks in the season but  now I ownly ketch a string of club fish, in  the same pond the club weigh from 6 to 20 oz  each net may go over 1 lb but they are very good  Eating for a change, and quite plenty in the season  I have seen half a Barrel in 10 foot square. I  spend most of my time in my Room in  my Room reading & writing or rather scribling as you will learn before you get through  reading this Letter. I dont pretend to write  so any body can read it without the gift  of translation. But I can read it as well  as I can Capt Hoopers. As I cannot preach  in public I go to the Temple and do what I can  for my Dead. I met 125 friends, in the Temple  on the 2 March, the day following my birth day, 73, 
 of them went through for my Dead. I spoke  to them a short time But Left the city the same  Evening, this is the first time but one that  I have spoken to any company in the capacity of  a meeting for 28 Months I was sealed for  73 couple of Dead friends, while there which  makes 3000 souls of Dead friends while I  have had Baptized Endowed & sealings,  for, and have 265 more to attend to to finish  up my Record, which I hope I may Live  to Accomplish wile it I received a good  Letter from Moses Thatcher giving me a whole  history of all the Mexican Mission which was  very interesting to me  [written in pink ink] The amount of Land bought  was 10000 Acres at Diaz 48000 [Acres at] Juarez  75000 A Carralis 133000 Acres total  Also $76000. dollar worth of  Machinery in operation  A 25 Horse power, Engine with  saw, shingle & Lath Mill, plaining &c.

June 4th, 1889  Elder Brigham Young,  Dear Brother:  In your favor of the 28th you ask the question, "Will you help the settlers at Ramah in their expenses in the court? It will come to that, no doubt; they will ask me that question."  We sincerely hope that they will not be under the  Necessity of carrying their case into the courts; for our experience in this direction is very discouraging.  We cannot expect justice, judging by the treatment that we have received in the past.  With love to you and praying the Lord to bless you,  I remain your brother,  W Woodruff

 OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  P. O. Box B. Salt Lake City, Utah, Feb. 5, 1896.  Elder Brigham Young,  Dear Brother:  Inasmuch as you have been appointed to attend the San Juan Stake Conference, which will be held at Bluff on the 22nd and 23rd insts., we wish you to consider the following items of business while there. You may find it necessary to release the Presi- dent of the Stake and Bishop Neilsen of the Bluff Ward, in consequence of their advanced age and growing infirmities. We suggest Platt D. Lyman for President and Cumen Jones for Bishop should you find it agree- able and proper to make such changes. Of course you will consult the feelings of the people in these matters. We understand the spiritual and temporal prosperity of the Stake require a change in the adminis- trative officers.  The Burnham Ward should have another Bishop. Bro. Luther Burnham seems to consider the labor of presiding in that ward too oner- ous in his present straitened circumstances, and that a more active man would suit the people better. If you find this to be the case, make such changes as may be necessary for the spiritual and temporal prosper- ity of the people of that ward.  The Jensen case ought to be handled with care. If, on inves- tigation, you find that Bro. Jensen of Mancos was justified in not attending the San Juan Conference recently held at Fruitland, continue your investigation of the case, which he (Jensen) submitted to us, at the Stake Conference which will be held at Bluff on the 22nd and 23rd insts.

 Use every precaution compatable with your duty, to save the feelings of Prest. Hammond and also the feelings of all those brethren who are in trouble and have to meet these charges and have judgment passed upon them.  God bless you.  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. Smith

 OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  P.O. Box B. Salt Lake City, Utah March 5, 1898.  Elder Brigham Young,  "El Carmelo," Pacific Grove, California.  Dear Brother Brigham:  We were much interested in listening to your letter of Feb. 24th, but grieved to hear that Sister Lizzie's progress towards recovery is so slow and her weakness so great. We commend your faith, and with you we believe that the promises made in her behalf will be fulfilled. You have our sincere and constant prayers that it may be so. In this feeling we are encouraged by the receipt of your telegram on President Woodruff's birthday in which you state that she is improv- ing. We trust your own health remains good. Ours, we are happy to say, is excellent.  The weather here has changed from winter to spring dry, clear and pleasant. This gives us hope that it is the same on the coast, and if so, is more propitious for Sister Lizzie's recovery as well as more agreeable for yourself. The early advent of spring in this region has, however, given cause for considerable apprehension of a scarcity of water next season, as the snow in the mountains surrounding this and neighboring valleys is said to be far below the average.  We had a call yesterday from Mr. Kraft who gave us a full particulars concerning your situation and the condition of  Sister Young, and he spoke of your devoted attentions to her in her sickness. He told us also of the faith which you and your daughter Katie, his wife, have in relation to Sister Young's recovery. We appre- 
 nan 
 ciate his kindness in calling upojn us as we were quite desirous to learn all we could about you.  Prest. Smith has been east for the last two weeks, he is ex- pected back Monday afternoon.  Of course you will have learned of the death of James T. Little His sisters were quite anxious to have him buried in temple clothing, but we could not see the propriety of permitting it.  We join in love to you all. You have our faith and prayers. The Lord bless you.  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff. Geo. Q. Cannon

Smith Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brethren:  Enclose a communication, receipted bills and account just received from the President of the Birmingham Conference, Henry Wood. He succeeded S. W. Western in the presidency and after whom ^(S. W. W.)^ many anxious enquires are ^made^ by his releatives and strangers. You can see by Bro. Woods letter the situation at a glance. Will you kindly refer this matter to Bro. Western and who may be found at or near Fillmore, and perhaps he will take immediate steps to remove the cause of distress which now afflict the brethren.  I am pleased to inform you that success is met with by brethren in their ministerial labors in a few places in the mission. Since we con- centrated the force of the Conference in London, things are looking up a little in that city. Baptisms occur occasionally, and the brethren are pushing outdoor meet- ings with Considerable zeal, in fact, this is the rule throughout the mission, Hiring Halls is useless for the people will not come to hear the elders, but street 
 preaching seems to suit the spirit of the times better.  We are in good health and prospering in all departments to a limited extent. The office business in every particular is right up to the mark ^Mr^ Tenbroeck to the Contrary notwithstanding. We are obliged to send emigrants sterage when ^their means is limited^ they can go no other way; and we cannot send advices, particulars in numbers and items of age destination etc, matter for making out their tickets on that side of the water only as we have been doing, for we cannot cable all these particulars, ^it would be too expensive^. In future we shall write Mr. T. by the vessel preceeding the sailing of companies that, saints are expecting to sail we on such a vessel, with all the data we are in possession of, which will not be sufficient to enable him to make out the RR. tickets, for changes occur up ^to^ the day of sailing.  God is blessing our labors, and tho  the weather is cool yet it is warm enough to bring health to me. Mrs Y is better now ^in health^ than at any time ^previous^ while residing on this Island.  We are praying for your continued welfare, &, ^also^ mourning over the political ^complications^ which seem to crop out in unlooked for quarters to an alarming extent. God help us to keep up this end of the even or. Our hands are full, and often our hearts are too full and God alone can relieve us of the burthen.  Love to the brethren. Praying God to prolong your lives I am your brother in Christ.  The brethren join in love.  Brigham Young

[sideways text end]  Presedents Wilford Woodruff George Q. Cannon Joseph F. Smith S. L. C. Utah U. S. A.  Dear Brethren:  Enclose you a letter from Prests. T. Metz who wishes to be releived, person- ally, and have the Netherlands Mission account cred- ited the amount of emigration money paid for the parties named viz   30. 9. 6. His proposition to have the note transfered to me or to this office is altogether inadmissable but as Bro. M. felt positive that the elder would pay it, and no doubt Bro Brown is equally as sanguine, tho  I have had my faith much shaken un- der simelar circumstances, perhaps you will do something.  The Netherlands Mission needs assistance more elders. I found Prest. Metz in very poor health and he had but two efficient assistants Bros A. Farrell and  Hyde. Bro. Subert is not advanced in the langu- age far enough to render much help for the present. The labors of these brethren are ^at^ Rotterdam & Amsterdam, with their hands full, indeed, a portion of the time they are badly over worked. Neither Bro. Farrell nor Hyde are in robust  health. Prest. Metz is quite feeble; poor food, cold weather, exposure and over work have made a great change in 
 rugged man. Unless the genial climate of Arizona restores him to his normal condition of health I doubt his living very long. I was more surprised to find him in this con- dition because I have known him as arough and ready pontuismans able to endure every hardship.  Bro. Farrell understands the business of the Mission and speaks the language very well. Bro. Metz has all confi- dence in him and feels sanguine that he is competent to suc- ceed him in the presidency of the Dutch or, rather Nether- land Mission. Bro F is not more than 24 years old but has much experience at home and abrodt. However the the Mission must have a presedents ^perhaps you can send a man.^ Bro. Metz must be released and will part sometime in November. The saints love him and they also love the other elders, Bro. M.  has done a good work.  More elders are needed. There are but four elders at present in the Netherland Mission and there ought to be not less than  twelve. Brussels 2; Antwerp two; Liege two; Holland six. From the best information I can obtain and good work can be done in that country if help is given them.  The British Mission still lives but the pulse is feeble. Turkish Mission is struggling for existence. The brethren are encouraged by the  Spirit, not externals. With a little trouble I could meet the Turk- ish Minister, it is a great thing in the world to be known, and I have noticed a revolution in the feelings of educated classes in this country.  My health is good. My daughter ^Katie^ cables she will come, she is in a distressing condition and comes for a surgical operation, I will meet her in N. Y. which I trust you will approve of.  Love to the Brethren; God bless you. Your Bro in Christ.  Brigham Young.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE  42, Islington, Liverpool,  May 21st 1892  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother  Elder Prime Coleman informs us that circumstances were such that he was unable to go through the Endowment house before he came on his Mission, and that if he returns to his home in Arizona he might not be able to get there for sometime, so I advised him to book to Salt Lake City and  represent his case to you on his arrival, as he will not have the means left to take  him home  Yours truly Brigham Young J.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42, Islington, Liverpool.  May 24 1895  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother  On May 21st there  were four Scandinavian Missionaries returned  to Utah and charged to the Church account,  one of them was Niels Peter Larsen of Pleasant  Grove Utah County, whom President E H Anderson  of the Scandinavian Mission reported on his  list as a returning Missionary, but in his  letter of advice to us he says. "Elder Niels  P Larsen came here last summer on genealogical business but was so successful among his friends that he remained to assist in the mission where he has done a good work among  his relatives and acquaintances. If you  can pass him he will feel well over it, but  if not why he will either pay or give you a  note" and as we had not authority  to pass him free, we took the enclosed note  for  14.17.6, which is just the cost to this  office of sending him from Copenhagen to Utah,  and told him if any other arrangements were  made they would have to be made with you.  Yours truly Brigham Young JCC  P S we have not passed the  amount of note through our books 
 Brigham Young May 21st 1892. 
 Deseret July 11th 1892  President. W. Woodruff  Dear Brother  I received a communication from you on Friday Last and have noted its contents and must say in reply that in the main the Letter of Brother Wood & President Young are correct that is the charges against me in the first place. I had the chapel in Birmingham Repaired up as it was going to ruin and thought we could raise money enough in the Birmingham Conference to pay the bill but I was mistaken, I raised what  I could and told Brother G. T. Spokes I would be- come responsible for the Balance due ten pounds my self as I felt when I returned home to lay the matter before the 
 Bishop and Counsel also the Teachers Qourum and I thought it would  be easy to raise the money but I was mistaken Some have promised to help and I have waited month after month in the vain hope that many would assist me  I also owe Mr Dean the tailor for one suit of Clothes. 4. Pounds he was very kind and made me the offer and said time and again that I need be in no hurry I told him as soon as I returned home I would send the money as soon  as I could get straightened around. I also owe Brother Grant Z Bullock 3. dollars and my Sister ten pounds all of which I promised to return at an early date but the money belonging to the Spendloves ^Boy^ is not 
 quite correct, he gave me a check for ten dollars this Spring early and told one to send it to his folks it was some time before I could get a  ten dollar bill for it some time after he asked me if I had sent it. I told him no as I had only just got it changed but would, he went off with a sheep herd and after he left I concluded to keep the money untill the boy came back to deseret and let him send it him- self then if there was any loss it would not by my fault; he came here in June and I wrote a letter to his folk, with him put in the money and had him mail it himself, and I presume his parents had the money when President Wood wrote to President Young 
 Now for all the Excuse I  have to offer, when I left England I thought I could go to work on my return home and raise the money and send it back in a very short time, and I delayed writing thinking I would have the cash to send very soon, I began work the first week on my return home in the shop I am a Blacksmith by trade, there was some freighting going on ^to^ the Fish Spring Mines I done lots of work in fixing up teams and soon had over $100.00 owing me but I could not get the money they put on  more teams to haul I worked hard and about the last of October they the owners of the Mines soop stoped the teames from hauling and the boys were all in debt 
 for wagons and other things and the stores took all there pay and I have not got my money yet but have waited and expected it every month and failed to get it, I sold a mare harness & Wagon this spring for $150.00 trusting to get the money to pay off those debts but have not been able to collect a dollar in casth on it as yet, I have offered a mare and colt valued at $20000. for $10000 in order to pay the debt. I  have also offered to sell my water stock in the Deseret Irrigation Company for 50 cents on the dollar and cannot do so. I have several hundred dollars oweing me but cannot collect unless I sue for it, and now I am mortgageing my home to raise the money to 
 pay the amount I owe which I amc determined to do at an early date I feel heartly ashamed of myslef, the reason I failed to write to those parties was because I expected to have the money to send every money and I wanted to money to go with the letters, but I will write and make matters right and will send the  money at an early date I expect in a short time to have the money as I have applied for a loan on my home and have the promise of it and am anxious to pay every dollar I owe God being my helper, and I believe I done some good while on my mission and I have not lost the good Spirit, and there is no harder wroker in this wrard than myself 
 for the building up of the Kingdom, and I can say there is no man in this county or stake that would respond quicker to the call to go and preach the gospel than Elder. S. W. Western, and I would be willing to go right back where I was if it was neccessary ever willing to abide counsel and do what is required of me and hoping this will be Satisfactory I remain your Brother in the Gospel  Samuel. W. Western  I would be pleased to  hear from you again S. W. W

W. Woodruff & Counsellors  Dear Brethren:  Your favor 16th oct. received. I am grateful to you for Contents, and have failed to carry out your kind per- mission to close the printing in this office perevious to Bro Andersons departure. However we have counselled over the situation tho- roughly, I believe, and have Concluded to shoot up the press and let that ^work^ out first. Bro A. was opposed to shutting up the composing loan; ^he^ thought we could do better to keep it running for the present. I shall consider it thoroughly before I move contrary to his advise in this matter. I am strongly impressed  to leave the building, and shall work with that end in view, as the Lord opens the way and the spirit intimates.  I have called my son Albert into the office & also Bro. Callister. Albert has taken Bro. Cut- lers place. Wilby is here and has the spirit of his mission, we shall get on very well no doubt. The fog and rain, cold damp atmosphere, were telling on me and I wanted my son near me. He is Competant 
 to fill the place I believe, for in advance of some who have taken that department heretofore. Bro Cutler & Bro. Anderson have dwarfed their predecessors, and left a splendid record to guide their successors.  It seems necessary to send a few more companies. Twenty souls, emigrants, and seven elders sailed on the Arzona saturday. Another Company of eighteen emigrants and about seven elders will sail on the SS Nevada 5th prox. ^Wisconsin^ 22nd inst. Another company will sail on the 5 of Nov. S.S. Nevada  Shall confine the numbers going on these vessels to 25 souls or thereabouts. There are saints who want to go later in Nov. perhaps a company on the S.S. Arizona which sails on the 12th prox. If it is convenient will sail with my family on that date for N. Y. I shall return on her ^Arizona^ so far as I know at present unless otherwise instructed by you.  The tithing of the mission has, through hard times, sunk to nothing. Fair prospects for converts in some places, considering the times. The elders are hopeful and have put in good work during the summer in out- door preaching.  Mrs ^sister^ Esselman has sued Guion & Co. for goods destroyed ^by fdisinfecting on Wyoming N Y.^ or threatened to do so. She had better sue the state. Mr. Rams- den much annoyed with this complaint for he was power- less to help it. I have assured him of my feelings on the subject.  Love to the brethren in which we all join  Your Bro in Christ Brigham Young 
 42 Islington L.pool Eng. Aug 20th 1892.  Prest Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother: I have no  desire to increase your burdens, God knows you have enough to bear, but I have been much exercised concerning a few points contained in Bro. Roberts lecture ^which he^ delivered before the mMutual iIm- provement Ass[ociati]on on authority of Priesthood.  I quote a few a fewseveral items which have come to my mind, and in all that I say I desire to give no offensce to my brethren in any particular. I can not say there is one iota of untruth contained in the lecture, but in my judgement the lecturer does not ex- plain, sufficiently, points of vital importance. These ^points^ have a double signifficance at this period of political excitement; and ^the^ puting forth "liberal" ideas ^in political matters^ which have brought our Republic to the verge of desolution, and will ^yet^ prove an important factors in the ultimate overthrow of man made governments, vis perfect freedom to lie debanch, the stronger oppress the weak, the rich grow richer the poor grow poorer; the spirit shrinks and the body enlarge its beastly propensities, are distressing to contemplate.  Please give mey ideas consideration and send me the advice and counsel that is necessary to make ^me^ wise as a 
 serpent and harmless as a dove.  I have always believed that, when when Christs author- ized servants had it revealed unto them that a certain man was the individual to preside over the church His church, this might be sustained, but not revoked by His people. I have the privilege of showing to God and man that, I am in harmony with that revelation and my sign of cove- nant is the evidence, which I can produce on the spot, of my unswerving allegiance to Him. All things are done by common consent which comes through obedience to the head.  "Joseph presided over the church by the voice of the  people." Very true, and the people were the church of Christ because they sustained His prophet, which is equally true.  "Joseph presided over the church etc." "The people chose to have it so." "He always filled that station by the voice of the people." These statements are all true, but I think that, with^out^ further explenation they are calculated to mis- lead the minds of our children. If it is deemed wisdom to leave these things as they are as they appear in print, I am content. Please render me a little assistance to put the break on with a little more force.  "Eeclesiastical governments as well as civil derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." I am in- clined to think that, there is a destinction between h the ^two^ govern- ments, God calls and authorizes a man, he gathers the people and they sustain him. Men gather and appoint ^or elect^ their head. One originates in God, the other in man. 
 In comparison, God has a fine stepper properly harnessed to his ^beautifuly proportioned vehiacle^ to bear the burthen; while man has nothing but a push cart. True, majorities controle in the world & they ^the wicked^ will seek to push this doctrine upon us, on purpose to destroy the church. I know their cunning is not equal to the wisdom of God, and I pray for strength to stand when these two powers will, apparently, so nearly tie that the boldest will tremble in the conflict. A bare majority of the people may reject the prophets of God and by their votes sustain men more con- genial to their tastes, but in doing this they cut out the only receiving office on the line through which revelation can come to them. The mai- jnority who sustain the prophet by their votes, are all that is left of the church of Christ.  The agency of man consists in his having ^had^ power delegated to him to select his master. I exercise my will power by being obedient to the chosen of the Lord. I believe our youth should be taught to sustain the authorities of the church irrespective of of numbers. I fix my eyes upon you; I listen to your counsel, I try to live to have the same spirit that actuates you. The testimony of the spirit in one is that, your mistakes should you make any will be overruled by God for His glory and the good of His people. I beseech the Father to give me strength to follow you as you follow Christ our Lord.  Will the time ever come when a majority of those claiming mem- bership in the church whatever object they have had in joining the church will reject the Presidency and Apostles by vote in the general assembly of the people. I beleive the devil has that little game on foot  that is, the idea, exists in the hearts of men today.  I am content to leave things as they are for now I feel better. If I have hurt your feelings in any wise forgive me. I could not rest until I had chatted with the presidency.  I strive to do my duty in my weak way. In contrast with the brightness of the more youthful elders, there is much of the old fogy in me I find.  Love to the brethren. God bless you dear brother I am your^s^ in Christ  Brigham Young

 [sideways text] Brigham Young Sept. 22nd 1892 [end of sideways text]  LATTER-DAY SAINTS' EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42, Islington, Liverpool  Sept. 22nd 1892  President Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith; Dear Brethren:  Your cable received and it met our hearty endorsment. Our next company sails on the S.S. Alaska 1st prox, and numbers about thirty (30) souls: This is the last company we shall send until things look more favourable. We expect the "Arizona" to sail on the 15th prox. and she will carry a number of our elders, Bro. Jas H. Anderson among them. We shall welcome Bro. Dougall and trust that he is all sufficient to fill the place on the Star, vacated by Bro. Anderson. We could not expect him to be as efficient as Bro. Jas. in every department: he must live many years and improve every moment of his time in order to reach the plane of intelligence to which Bro. Anderson has attained. I tell you brethren I am a mere babe in current intelligence: and I believe that it needs a much more intelligent man than myself to carry on this business successfully that is keep the mission and the Star up to their present status. I beg of you brethren to send as many missionaries this  fall as you convieniently can. I wish we had two hun- dred more men in the field. True we do not make many converts, but what we are doing requires more help. The neglected districts containing millions of 
 people who are ripe for salvation, or damnation, where the labors of efficient elders are greatly needed, may be counted by the score; the conference Presidents appeal to me in vain for more help. If agreeable to you and circumstances favour it, I shall send my  family home sometime before Christmas: and if you are willing, shall cross the water to N.Y. with them providing it will cost nothing for me to go and return. My wife is timid and will hardly be willing to sail without me. She could remain in a warm climate, which would cost money: but funds are scarce with all parties at present. Bro. Cutler and I visited Mr Ramsden today: our interview was very satisfactory. I informed him it was doubtful about our sending any more emigrants after the 1st prox. until we knew more definitely concerning actions of those whipper-snappers on the other side of the Atlantic. He agreed with us it would be unwise to send companies of emigrants, especially in consideration of the action taken in relation to the intermediate passengers on S. S. Pavonia, Cunard line. The Wisconsin and Arizona are now on the water carrying companies of our people in 2nd cabin, who may be treated the same as the Pavonia people vis. quarintined for three weeks. Your favour, 9th inst., pertaining to Bro. Dougall just received: I thank you much for the official information and with the help of God we shall succeed in our duties so long as we are relegated to this land. My health has been precarious: the back part of my head occassioning me pain and trouble: but I am much better now. The mission is prosperous and all well. With love to all the brethren, I am your brother in the  Gospel.  Brigham Young

 [sideways text] Brigham Young Oct. 4 [18]92 [end of sideways text]  LATTER-DAY SAINTS' EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42, Islington, Liverpool Oct 4th 1892  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother  I received a letter from Elder Don C. W. Musser a few days since dated Haifa, Palestine Sept 6th 1892 in which he says he and Elder Adolf Haag arrived there on August 31st by way of Alexandria Port Said and Jappa. There are but two members of the Church at Haifa. Bro Grau and Sister Tegel, the latter an old lady who was desirous of donating 100000 franks for the Turkish Mission, and had paid him 500 franks of the amount.  He states that since arriving in Turkey Bro Haags health has not been good, and the day before he wrote which would be Sept 5th he complained of not feeling quite well and so went and laid down. In about an hour he awoke burning up with fever, in a few moments he was so weak he could hardly sit up and his heart was very much affected, and for a time Bro Musser was very much alarmed. He administered to him, and his heart became better but his fever was alarmingly high, he doctered him as best he could all day but about 3 oclock in the morning be became worse. They gave him a good sweating and when he woke he appeared to be better and was 
 resting niceley. and they felt confident the Lord would spare him to complete his mission and let him return to his loved onces in Zion, he thought it would be unwise to keep him in Turkey and thought the climate of Germany or Switzerland would suit him better, and I intended making the change, but it was not to be, for the next news that I received was a Telegram from Bro Musser dated Haifa 8 pm received last night saying "Elder Haag is dead" signed "Muszer," which I presume is intended for Musser.  Elder Haag arrived here March 15th having left his home at Payson Feby 18 [18]92, he labored in the Swiss & German Mission until the beginning of July, when he started for the Turkish Mission. We shall anxiously await Bro Mussers letters with details and will on their arrival immediately write you. Praying God to bless and comfort his wife and family I remain  Your brother in the cause of truth Brigham Young &c  PS I cabled Elder Musser "Deepest sympathy, inter with view of sending remains home." 
 yet some orchards will bear a middling crop some very fine apples in the orchards.  President Young's apple trees are some of them loaded, and a good crop of peaches; his grape vines are loaded, I think he will have 2 or 3000 lbs of grapes this  season.  It is a general time of health in this Territory except  a company that came in from the Mississippi brought the  small pox with them, but it has not spread much yet, and we hope it will not.  A company arrived from Carson Valley on the 28th inst, they report that Murray, who was tried for murder last winter was killed by the Indians, also a man by the  name of Reddin.  Your family are all well. Brothers Bates and Luke Johnson are about to start on a Mission of about one  month, with Seth M. Blair to Ruby Valley on an exploring  expedition to open a new route to Carson Valley. They expect to meet bro Enoch Reese with a company from Carson to  cooperate with them.  Our Agricultural and Manufacturing Society are making quite an exertion to promote Home Manufactures in this Territory, as the time has come when we see that we are under the necessity of making in a great measure what  we use. The various Wards of the City and Territory are forming auxiliary branches of the same; intending to Manu- facture all they can for home consumption.  During this month Elder Parley P. Pratt and a 
 opposite Prest. Young's buildings.  On the 29th Ulto we had a general muster and inspection of the Nauvoo Legion. Lieut. Gen. Wells and his staff received the troops, after which a hollow square was formed and the Lieut. Gen.  delivered an animating address to the troops, which was well sustained by the officers of his staff and chaplain.  We have had much excellent preaching lately by the First Presidency and others. Prest. Young has come out boldly and told this people in the name of the Lord, they must repent and be baptized for the remission of their sins. Several Wards have gone forward en masse been baptized and renewed their covenants before the Lord, and I believe the fire of a universal reformation in this Territory has been lit and will continue to burn, until a permanent foundation for good works has been laid in our midst. We must  say since the organization of this church our ears have never been saluted with more pointed Godlike sermons, than have flowed lately from Prest. Young and his counsellors.  We are happy to announce the arrival of Elders F. D. Richards, Daniel Spencer, Jos. A. Young W. H. Kimball Geo. D.  Grant, James Ferguson, John Van Cott, C. H. Wheelock, N. H. Felt, Wm. C. Dunbar, J. T. D. McAlister & James McGaw.  yours truly  W Woodruff 
 On the 31st October, brother Gideon D. Gibbs and Horace Newell arrived from Elder Willie's hand cart coy., whom they left on the sweetwater, when the teams sent out at conference arrived at this camp, there had been twenty deaths, nineteen of them men. and while with them in one day there were fifteen burials, and when the messengers left there had been fifty deaths. They did not seem to be sick, but chilled through, men would dig graves for their brethren, and before night would die themselves. They had distributed  their last rations of Flour the night before the brethren met them and they did not know that any relief was at hand.  The reason of this difficulty and suffering [ink faded] with the emigration is in consequence of the companies starting so late, and  the early falling of snow in the mountains. Prest. Young has universally given counsel for the emigration to start early.  The hand cart companies who started early came in well indeed better than the most sanguine could have expected.  yours truly, W. Woodruff

The memorandum refered to was handed to me by bro. Snow at Albuquerque, Brigham & Jesse N. being far away.

If it were merely a personal consideration I would  have left immediately & reported to you, no matter what might have been the business consequences. I feel too badly to write much. I will telegraph immediately to you on my return.  The delay in writing was, if possible, to avoid going west & therefore see you the sooner & also because of the sad death of young bro.

 [sideways text] W. Woodruff Recd April 30 And May 4 1880 [end of sideways text]  Salt Lake City. 12th April 1880.  John W. Young.  Dear Brother,  This is the first min- ute I have attempted to write to any man in Arizona  since my arrival. I have been so overwhelmed with confer- ences, Meetings, councils and callers. But now to business:  First I will say that I have sent you a letter containing the  account of your matters at the Ferry. I do not know whether you  obtained it or not. I found your a/c at the Ferry as follows:  Your Order last drawn $222 30/100; private a/c $47 75/100 and W. Freeman's  ferriage, they said run by your order $41 75/100 total $31180.  Total Receipts of the Ferry while in the hands of Fouts $178500 one third  for the Church=$59500 $31180 leaves $28320 $6000 out for Mrs Lee leaves  $223 20/100 which was in the hands of Fouts when you settled with him un- less there is something else due him in your settlement with him.  What accounts you have sent concerning the Ferry is in the hands of the  Auditing Committee, which I have not yet had time to discuss with the  Comm. I looked over your list; I see you had put in your wagon to be  credited in your a/c $15000, so at this time I do not know whether  the 60 bus. of Grain could be allowed on that a/c. or not. I took your  letter to Eldridge concerning Mdse and he said that last year, you agreed  to send your wool to them to dispose of, until they got their pay, but 
 said you had put your wool in the hands of Libby to sell and  she had sold it and pocketed $150000 of the money and gone to  Philuadelphia. I do not think they feel disposed to advance any-  thing more. I understand they foreclosed mortgage on your property, and  have taken posssession of it. One of the Committee remarked to me, that  you borrowed $50000 of the Church before you left and was to  pay in wool, but they had not got it. As soon as the Comm. can get to  it, they will look over your a/cs. and do what they can with them. I  saw your Mother and had quite a talk with her. She said Libby had  sold your Library before she left. Your Mother was as well as usual. I had  a talk with Brigham. He said he had got an a/c of the wool he had sold;  had paid for it all I think in Orders. He said [blank space] had written  you several times but had received no answer. I told them I thought it was in  consequence of the mails. Sr Van Cott called upon me, enquired about Lula. I saw her mother to-day. She said she was looking for Lula to come home on  a visit. We had an excellent conference; a good spirit prevailed; a  large attendance. In the organization of the Young Men's M. I. Assn W. Woodruff was appointed the Supt., Moses Thatcher & Jos. F. Smith  counselors. I find my family well as usual, but I have hardly  had time to look one of them in the face. I received a telegram  from you from Albuquerque, which we answered. I saw a letter  to the Council in which you said, that you had more missionaries  than you wanted to hold the claims, and was sending some into  the vineyard. I shall be glad to hear from you at any time. Direct  to Salt Lake. Your Brother in the Gospel  W Woodruff  Remember me Kindly to Lula 
 Salt Lake City, May 2, 1882.  Brother John W. Young.  I write to say that your letter of April 26 has just arrived,  and been read to President Taylor, and the following quotation is  his view in relation to the subject of which you speak   "Arrangements are now being made, looking to the settlement  of some of our people in Mexico, and general instructions given  to certain parties in this matter. I would not feel at liberty to  recommend anything that would, in any way, directly or  indirectly, interfere with those affairs."  Your mother is still very low. We have buried Brother  Joseph L. Barfoot, who died very suddenly. Brother Jacob  Gibson died last night at Sugar House Ward. Bishop  Sperry lost another child yesterday. John Pack is very low, as also is your mother. The Presidency and Twelve and  families are as well as usual. But there is still consid- erable sickness among children. Remember me kindly  to your family and all inquiring friends.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff.

 Salt Lake City, April 20, 1880.  Mr. John W. Young.  Dear Brother, I have just received  your letter this morning, and I will say  that I think it is all right and would be  a good thing if the brethren could take  contracts on the railroad, to help them- selves so that they could get bread and  means. I would like to know where  the railroad is coming. Concern- ing the telegram I will say that Prest.  Taylor's views were that the Presidents of  Stakes should have an oversight over the  Co-op. stores and contracts on the railroad.  I sent you a letter on the 12th of April  in a letter to Lot Smith, in which I gave an account of matters up to that date,  which I hope you got.  Brother William  Peterson called on me this morning, in- quiring about you and your affairs. 
 He said he had a bill against you for  beef, a bill of $369, drawn by Libby  and others of your family, which he  said that you had promised to pay,  and Libby had promised to pay him,  and she had gone off without paying  a cent, and he felt bad about it and  wanted his money. Of course I could  do nothing for him in the matter.  I think it would be well for you to  write to him about it. Since I  came home I am satisfied that Tout  is the man that got out an indict- ment against our friend in Arizona.  I got a letter from Brother Hatch, say- ing that Brother Tenney had sent  somebody to borrow 100 head of cows of  Brother Flake to pay for St. John.  But we think the people who have gone  there should do what they can to help  raise the means to help pay for it.  Then I shall send to the Presidents 
 Salt lake City, May 26, 1881.  Elder John W. Young.  Dear Brother, After parting with  you last night, I went into the office  this morning and examined all of my  files of letters to you and Brother A. M.  Tenney. I find copies of six to A. M.  Tenney and four to you, and I read them  all thoroughly through, for I have copies  of all my letters both to him and you.  I wanted to see what I had written  to him which cast such reflections  upon you to cause you grief, and I  failed to find anything in any of  them to cast reflections on you.  You seemed to feel grieved that I had  not written to you.  I have copies  of letters which I wrote to you April 20,  May 6 and 27, and June 14, 1880,  and I have only received two from you 
 and bishops to get together what ti- thing stock there is in the different  settlements and use it as a loan to  pay on the purchase until it can  be secured. You ask me for coun- sel. My counsel would be concern- ing your temporal affairs, not to  involve yourself, any more than you  can possibly help, in debt, and  write to those whom you owe and  have promised to pay, and give them  an explanation and tell them  what you can do and what you  cannot, for when we promise  and do not fulfil it creates hard  feelings, as I saw was the case with  Brother Peterson this morning.  As you say, so say I, that I  am so full of councils, meetings,  and business that I have hardly  time to write to anybody.  Remember me kindly to Lula 
 and all my friends with you.  I do not know when this will  reach you.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W Woodruff  answered  May 31 [18]80  75+125+67=267

 Salt Lake City, May 6, 1880.  Mr. J. W. Young.  Dear Brother Fifteen days ago I wrote you a letter and supposed it was forwarded to you at Sunset in Lot Smith's letter. Today I found it in my drawer, and as I want to write you some more today, I will put them both together and send them in a letter to Lot Smith. I will send in this a copy of your account, and I will say that I laid your case before the council concerning your expenses in feeding the Indians. I got $549.43 appropriated for that purpose, but they wished it understood that it was not to set a precedent for future action.  The Naylor brothers have made some inquiry concerning your af- fairs, saying that you owed them 
 for wagons, but I could give no information what your calculations were about it.  The appropriation the Council made just settles your account, except your note of $15.00. In your letter to President Taylor, you asked if they would take yarn for pay. You can pay it all in yarn if you wish.  I have just seen Lulu's mother. She said she had got a letter from her, and she said she was going to return to Moan Coppy soon.  I shall request Lot to forward this to you the first opportunity. My respects to her and the Saints with you. I think M. Thatcher will soon return to Mexico.  The council are well as usual. I am enjoying fair health.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST. OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS.  P. O. BOX B.  Salt Lake U. T 27 Dec. 1888  Prest. W. Woodruff,  Dear Brother:  Elder F. D. Richards  desires me to present the following for your consideration. Some short time ago Elder Frederick Allisback of Payson  was notified to take a mission to Germany, to leave here on  9th of Next April.  He replied to you saying he would be  ready.  At that time his Bishop had promised him, so  he states, to take care of his family during his absence.  He  has since called upon Bro. Richards and states that the  Bishop has now told him he cannot help his family while  he is absent.  Bro. Allisback is quite a poor man, and  wishes to know what he is to do, as he cannot do anything  towards leaving his family any supplies.  Most of the  German brethren called are poor men. 
 Rec'd Dec 17 [18]88 and  Ans'd  [Dec]  28 [1888]  I believe that more Elders have been called  from Payson during the past two years than from  any other place of its size, and probably the bishop  feels he has too heavy a load to carry.  Respectfully, Your Brother  Geo Reynolds

Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Bro. :  I sent telegram to Elder  Geo. Reynolds to-day in rela- tion to the case of Bro. Sylvanus C.  Hulet, Jr. who had been called  as a missionary to the North- western States, and subsequently  released.  Bro. Hulet came  in, and showed me your  letter containing his release.  He had made almost  ready to start when the time  should arrive, and expected nothing else, and he would  now rather go on this  mission if you so wish  it, but is willing to labor  where you feel best to 
 place him  He is young and  vigorous; has but a small  family; is in fair circumstan- ces; is exemplary in all his  habits; and, I think, would  make an efficient worker  in the missionary field.  The affairs of the bishopric  can be provided for in a safe  way until such time as you  may send some one to look  after those matters in this stake.  In view of a step  in contemplation, we both  feel it would be wise to  yet call him unless you  are impressed to the con- trary.
