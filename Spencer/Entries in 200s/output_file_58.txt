 [Enc: Abraham Jackson Aug 1895]    Mound Fort, Aug. 28th, 1895  To President Wilford Woodruff,  or whom it may concern:    In signing bro Abraham Jackson's  acceptance of the call to go on a mission, I trust it  will not be considered obtrusive for me to make the  following statement:    Bro. Jackson is 55 years of age, his  wife is 47. He has a family of seven children, inclu-  ding an orphan girl 14 years old, for whom he has under-  taken to provide. He has a moderately comfortable  house on about five acres of land, situated about one  and one-half mile northwest of the Ogden Tabernacle.  He has two cows, a span of horses, a wagon &c. But  the proceeds from his land will little more than pay  expenses and taxes.    Having formerly been a clerk in Z. C.  M. I., and thinking he could make a living for his  family at merchandising, he, nearly a year ago,  mortgaged his home for $800.00 @ 10%, and  commenced a grocery &c business in Ogden City.  Oweing to the general financial depression his business  for months did not amount to much; but it has  steadily increased a little, until now he thinks he  is barely clearing expenses and making a scant  living.    He proposes to leave his business in the

 hands of his son who is 24 years of age, has a   wife and one [Harry L. Jackson|child, and is a steady and indus-  trious, young man but has not the business experi-  ance nor the attraction for customers, perhaps, which  his father posesses; and whether under the manage-  ment of the son, in the absance of his father, the business  will continue to grow until it is profitable or decline  to the financial ruin of bro. Jackson and the loss of  his mortgaged home, must, of course, remain for  the future to determine. The young man is now  taking an active part in conduct the store, and  bro Jackson thinks the business will not suffer  during his absance.    Bro Jackson has not had his endow-  ments, his wife, until a few weeks ago, declining  to accompany him to the Temple. She now being  willing, they will attend to the necessary ordinances  before he leaves for his mission.    Bro Jackson is a good and useful   man in the ward, being a Teacher and also leader of  our choir, and liberal in his donations &c. But not  all good men are surrounded by circumstances and  blessed with faculties that emminently fit them for the  missionary field.    I submit the foregoing for your con-  sideration; at the same time assureing you that bro  Jackson is very willing to take this mission, and  would not decline to respond to any call made upon  him by the Priesthood of God.

 Naturally going to Provo   cramped me some little   for money and I cannot   leave in as good shape as  I would like. But the   money matter is of little moment   when considered in relation   with either calling.    My family is composed of  wife and six children under  twelve years of age.    Now President Woodruff do not  think these are excuses for I   do not wish them considered   that way, byut mearly as a stat-  ment of my circumstances.

 If you think it best for   me to go can your office   give me the aproximate   cost of getting there and   what clothing it will be   better for me to take. Also   what date it will be   necessary for me to be in   S. L. City to be set apart.    One more circumstance in   favor of my going is that I   am 36 years old and have   not been on a foreign  mission.

That you are a republican, and are working  upon the sympathies of the doubtful voters  and others for them to vote as you desire  them in that line. Now, I would like a  line from you, not as to your political faith,   but as to whether you desire such dis-  picuble ward heelers to resort to such  work in order to gain voters.

If this, the assignment, is broken, then the directors be-  come responsible, individualy, for the amount borrowed  from the bank and having but little property it will  work an untold hardship on me.  3rd It is only some six years since I returned  from a three year's mission to the islands. Yet  I do not plead that as an excuse from not  going. But financially, I plead as an excuse.  If you deem it wise, however for me to go, I will   arrange my affairs as best I can, and travel   cheerfully toward the setting sun upon a mission  of love to the Kind and loving Maori people.

Dear Brother:- Your letter, asking me to take a mission  to Skandinavia at once, was handed me upon my return  home from the sheep camp on the desert.    I am sorry to report that owing to the brief time intervening,  it will be impossible for me to be ready to start on March 3rd.  I am perfectly willing to take a mission, if I can be allowed  a little time to shape my affairs. I am somewhat involved,  and have leased some sheep on contract that does not  expire until next October, so that to leave before that  time would exntail heavy financial losses upon me.  In regard to place, Skandivia suits me very well, as I  can speak Danish very well, also as I am unable to  undertake long walks, having had both legs broken  and somewhat cripp[l]ed.    Trusting you will kindly favor me with the asked  for extension of time, I remain,    Your Brother in the Gospel,  Andrew Larsen    Let us say next Oct.  for him, if that will   do. J. F. S.
