ENDENTRY but instead of appreciating the kindnes of the People and my earnest work in his favor Redicule and Insinuation have been the reward, this however is more his relation than him in talking to him about it he said he would like to go on that mission as soon as he could get the necessary means, but I could realise that the influense of the Famely have had some bearing on him, of course they are trying to place the blame on me, but I am not the first man there has been blamed without a cause, but thousands of my Brethern in this Church have past through such things,  only a great deal more so. I have generally tried to bear my own feelings without making them known to my Brethern over me, knowing that they have enough of their own, but I felt it my duty to let you know that he was not going, and I have been moved upon to give this explaination, so I trust you will bear with me. -- I remain your  Brother in the Gospel.
