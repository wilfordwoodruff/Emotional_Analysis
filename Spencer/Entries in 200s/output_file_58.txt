YetI do not plead that as an excuse from notgoing.

Wilford Woodruff.Box B.Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:- Your letter, asking me to take a missionto Skandinavia at once, was handed me upon my returnhome from the sheep camp on the desert.I am sorry to report that owing to the brief time intervening,it will be impossible for me to be ready to start on March 3rd.I am perfectly willing to take a mission, if I can be alloweda little time to shape my affairs. I am somewhat involved,and have leased some sheep on contract that does notexpire until next October, so that to leave before thattime would exntail heavy financial losses upon me.In regard to place, Skandivia suits me very well, as Ican speak Danish very well, also as I am unable toundertake long walks, having had both legs brokenand somewhat cripp[l]ed.Trusting you will kindly favor me with the askedfor extension of time, I remain,Your Brother in the Gospel,Andrew LarsenLet us say next Oct.for him, if that will do.
