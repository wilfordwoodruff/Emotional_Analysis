 Provo, May 26, 97.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah  Dear Brother Woodruff:    My missionary call was   rec'd May 17, [18]97 and with pleasure  I accept the same. It gives me  great joy to know I'm worthy  (in your eyes) to enlist in the  army of God to battle for victory  alone, for it is the army march-  ing under the banner of truth—  "Truth must pervail."    I'll write an acceptance to your   call when I reach home—Toquer-  ville. St George Stake, Utah, where  my Bishop lives.    Ill be ready on the 15th of July  to leave Salt Lake City, Utah.

 Great Salt Lake City  September 2nd, 1856.    To all whom it may concern,    This is to certify that  the case of Margaret D. Petty, in the case of Robert C.   Petty deceased was referred to me by President Brigham   Young, to investigate and decide and settle.    Therefore I would hereby say that inasmuch as  Robert C. Petty did consecrate all that he possessed before  leaving on his mission, and whereas Margaret Petty is his  legal wife for time and Eternity, and has seven children to  support; and whereas Mary Adelia Northrop Petty is a proxy   case, and has left the fort and gone to her Father's home  and taken with her three head of cattle, it is my decision  and council that the 10 acres of land, cattle, sheep, or any   other consecrated property which now remains, should not   be sold for the support of Mary Adelia Northrop Petty, but  that Margaret D. Petty have the stewardship of what  remains for the support of herself and children.  W. Woodruff

I began to lay  up means from that time on but  it went very slow I did not have   mutsh to do with and hard times  came, so my money came in very   slow.    be the best I hope you will  not fel unkind towards me i desire  to do the lords will I have  prayed very mutch about this  matter. I pray the lord to bless  you and the hole church in the  name of Jesus your Brother in  the Gospel Christian Stucki  I am swiss you by birth and  it was decired that I should go  to Switzerland and of course   it takes means to go there.  please excuse my poor riteing.    I am of the opinion, he should   be honorably excused and  released from Missionary  duties abroad. His education  demands it, I think. Let him  be excused, and his labors    [in upside-down text]  directed for the accomplish-  ment of as much good as pos-  sible at home.

 Historian's Office  G. S. L. City. July 31, 1856    Elder Benson,  Dear Sir,    While writing to Brother Pratt, I felt  it was your due to receive a page also. I will begin  by saying your family are well, though I presume Sister  Benson writes you by mail. I paid a visit to Tooele  and Rush Vallies a week ago on Saturday and Sunday.   I find the city of E. T. look sorrowful. Brother Maughn  and some others are going to leave, probably for Cache  Valley; their crop is mostly destroyed by the Salt, worms &c  I went with Elders J. C. Little, J. W. Cummings and C  V. Spencer; we called upon Bro Rowberry—got a good  supper—looked over the saw and grist mills, find  good work in the flouring mills. He thinks he will  start in six weeks. He went with us to Tooele City—  spent the night; started early next morning for Rush  Valley; when we got into it we saw a great smoke, thought  it was the smoke of Johnson's settlement, but found it to   be the old barracks on fire and burnt down; it had  been burning 24 hours or so: we hunted two hours, and  found Johnson & Co in six shanties near the mountains,  each cabin 30 rods apart in the best Indian's hole you  ever saw; two Indians could have scalped the whole  settlement and not alarmed any one until they felt an   arrow, for they were surrounded in the brush and cedars

 much farther we do not know. When they light upon the earth they eat  up every green thing as they go, leaving but little grass or herbage of any  kind. We made a rough estimate of the amount that lay dead upon the  shore of the Great Salt Lake last fall, having been washed ashore by the waves,  as they dropped into the salt water, and we made over one million ^& a half^ of  bushels, at one time thoroughly salted through; they formed a complete  belt around the whole Salt Lake shore, (the circumference of which is  about 300 miles) several rods wide, and varying from six to eighteen inches  deep. When they visit us in large bodies in the fall they deposit their  eggs in the earth, and early the following spring they hatch out, and the  earth is black with them. They eat up the wheat before they can fly, and  leave the earth as bare as a turnpike road. We are much troubled this   season with the (so called) large tobacco worm upon the potatoe tops, and  a cut worm at the roots, which are doing much damage to that crop; also  with a worm about an inch long upon the ears of corn; they begin at the  top end and eat the corn down the cob; this worm is annually with us,  but worse than usual this season; the green measuring worms are destroying  our cabbages and turnips very bad this season. We are now in the midst  of our wheat harvest, and shall have a fair crop; but the drouth has destroye[d]  a great quantity of crops of all kinds, as nearly all lands have to be  irrigated in this county in order to secure a crop. I will endeavor  to put up a specimen of the insects of this Territory as far as I can,  and forward them to your address the earliest opportunity. I shall take  pleasure in corresponding with you, and should be pleased to obtain  any reports containing information upon this subject. We have formed  Universal, Scientific, Agricultural, Pomological, and Horticultural  Societies in this city and territory, and shall feel thankful for any   information which will assist us in obtaining healthy orchards of fruit,   good fields of grain and vegetables, and the newest mode of destroying 
 Historian's Office, G. S. L. City   August 30th 1856  Hon. Geo. A. Smith,   Dear Sir  Among the strange events of the   19th century, the Eastern Mail arrived at 6½ o'clock P.M.  of the 28th inst, bringing your letter of July 15th, also your  joint letters to Prest. Young, from Washington, in connexion   with many other letters, scraps, papers &c. As soon as we   obtained them we went up to the President's Office and staid  till 1/2 past 10 o'clock; they show us the dark and gloomy   state of the political Horizon, Health of the nation, and friend-  ship for Utah &c., but we have all this consolation of  knowing that there is a God who will guide the Storm  unto the End, and give every man and nation their just   due—for which we feel thankful; we can see the word of   God and prophecies of Joseph, Brigham and other prophets,   ancient and modern, fast fulfilling upon the Earth, espe-  cially in the United States. It is all right, the storm will  soon burst upon the nations, and no power will stay   it. I would far rather be in the place of Utah and   receive her reward than to have to meet the coming  events and have the rewards of the other States and people.    You are remembered by us continually; we feel   it our duty according to the Bible to pray for both friends  and enemies.    You will perhaps learn before this reaches you, that 
 Historian's Office   Great Salt Lake City  August 30th 1856.    Brother I. F. Carter,    Dear Sir,    The Eastern Mail came in on   the evening of the 28th, which is much earlier than usual;   it brought me your favor of July 9th, containing the reciept   of the money paid by the Hon J. M. Bernhisel. We sent   a long family letter to Father Carter by the same mail,  also to Shuah and Freedom. We hear nothing said about   either letters; we do not know whether they were received or   not. I have written to you almost every mail for the   last three years, and I have received but few letters from   you during the last year, and it seems you do not get   near all of mine.    We learn by the Mail from our Delegates at   Washington that the political Horison, Health of the Nation   and friendship for Utah is very dark and gloomy, but it   is all right with me, there is a God that will guide the   storm unto the end, and will pay every man and nation   their just due; and I feel thankful for this, I would rather   be in the position of Utah and receive her reward than   to be in the position and receive the reward of many others.   I do not ask our friends in the States to mourn for us, or   pity our condition, but let them mourn and weep for them-  selves and prepare for that which is to come. The United 
 Historian's Office  G. S. L. City, July 31st 1856    Hon. J. M. Bernhisel    Dear Sir,    Your letter of April 7th has   come to hand after taking a fishing tour down the  Weber River for six weeks; the letter bag that was lost or  flung into the Weber River was found by an Indian, and  it was brought to this City.    Neither your family nor myself received and   thing from the Mill, or bro Houtz—we are both out of  flour—I furnished Mrs Bernhisel with flour as long as  I had it. I am now cutting my wheat—may be some  300 bushels: as soon as I can get it thrashed I will supply  her what the Mill does not, but it seems to be a pinching  time at present. Sister Bernhisel has laid the matter  before President Young, and informed him that Bro Houtz  does not furnish him with anything, so she says, and  told him that if he does not do his duty in the matter  he will attend to his case. Mr Houtz takes a strange  course in relation to your business.    Sister Bernhisel is well—she was at my house  to day.    We are in the midst of harvest: there will be  a great deal of wheat cut this season in the Territory; but  it will require a great deal of care to save it all, or we  shall be worse distressed before another harvest than we 
 Historian's Office  Great Salt Lake City  August 30th 1856    Hon J. M. Bernhisel    Dear Sir,    Our wheat harvest is in, and  we begin to have bread again. Bro. Houtz has began  to bring flour again to your family, and also some to  me, (224 lbs) but as long as he could sell it at a high price,  he was careful not to let either of us have any. I have not  seen him of late. Money is getting very scarce in this   Territory, there is but little in circulation. Your thrashing  machine is in operation; I expect to employ it in about  a week to thrash 3 or 400 bushels of wheat. Your family  are all well. I have had your wood cut up of late, and  your oxen have began to draw some (2 loads) I hope they  will continue.    It is a general time of health with us in this  Territory. I think the wheat has come in quite good  throughout most of the Territory; corn looks tolerably  well; potatoes appear quite a light crop. I have cut  both the samples of wheat and corn you sent me from the  Patent office: the wheat got ripe in 90 days, it is the  California Bearded Wheat, a little Taos in it got ripe in  85 days; the Bearded Wheat is not near as profitable as  the Taos a Club. The heads are short, and it yields one   third less to the acre, and not as good to handle. 
 He told them to go to and fort up. The settlement at Grants-  ville.    On the 24th of July proclaimed themselves indepen-  dent of British Rule, and Jack Reddin nominated Bro  Cooley as President, Wilford Hudson, and Arieh C.

Young about it—he finally confirmed the organization,   and let them have it their own way.    We are in the midst of our wheat harvest, but a   great loss of wheat for the want of water. Worms are  destroying corn and potatoes a good deal, but we shall  have a pretty fair crop of wheat, corn and potatoes: frost  has killed some.    Tintick and his band are camped in Scull Valley;  we expect he will visit the people for more scalps and  cattle. He has about 21 men with him now. Auapene  and Ammon were with us on Sunday—they felt well.   Ka-no-she was badly kicked by a horse—broke two ribs,   but he is getting better.    It is a general time of health with us all. I am  troubled with the rheumatism a good deal of late.    The California mail arrived on the 29th—not much  news, only the people have risen up against the Governor,   officers and law, and the county is proclaimed in a   State of Insurrection.

 Great Salt Lake City  September 2nd 1856.    To Elder  McGee Harris, President of Fort Herriman    This is to inform you that Sister Margaret  Petty called to see President Young upon the subject of settling  her estate. President Young has requested me to hear her   case and settle it. I have heard her testimony upon the   subject, but have not heard the testimony of Mary Adelia,  not having the opportunity of seeing her. From the informa[t]ion  which I have obtained upon the subject, my decision and   council would be as follows:    That whereas Elder Robert C. Petty did consecrate  his land, cattle, and all that he possessed to the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints before he started on   his Mission; and inasmuch as Margareth Petty has seven  children to support, and is his legal and lawful wife, for time   and eternity; and inasmuch as there is but 10 acres of land  under improvement, and whereas Mary Adelia is a proxy case  for time, and has left and gone home to her friends, and taken  three head of cattle with her.    In consideration of these things my council would be   that there be no land, or cattle, or any thing else that was consecrated  sold for the benefit of Mary Adelia Northrop, more than what she  has obtained, but that Mrs Margaret Petty have the  stewardship  of what remains for the support of herself and children.    W. Woodruff 
 Historian's Office  Great Salt Lake City  August 30th 1856    President Orson Pratt,  Dear Sir,  The Eastern Mail arrived on  the 28th inst, and brought many letters from our Friends  at Washington, and other parts of the Globe, with the   "Star," "Mormon" and many other papers which gave us  the general news of the day, and showed us that the   political state of the Atmosphere at Washington and   throughout the Nations was anything but calm and   serene. We heard but little from our handcart emigration,  or any of the back Companies. Philemon C. Merrill and   company arrived on the 16th inst; as far as we could  learn all well. I had an interview with Dr J. Clinton  who was well and in good spirits.    The weather has continued dry since we last  wrote. Our wheat harvest is gathered and proved to  be a much better crop than we could have expected, consi-  dering the drouth; the heads were well filled even where  the wheat was so short that it had to be pulled, which  has been the case with many acres this season. Our corn  crop looks quite well. The potatoe crop is nearly a failure,  they mostly run to vines. Beets and garden vegetables  look well. This season is not our peach bearing year, 
 those destructive insects.    Yours respectfully,  W. Woodruff    My address is   Wilford Woodruff,  Historian's Office,  Great Salt Lake City,  U.T. 
 Historians office  G. S. L. city 30 Augt. 1856    Ed. of the Luminary    Dear Sir,    Since writing to you last month the weather has  continued dry and favorable for harvesting. The Wheat in many instances  has filled out in the ear; much better that possibly could be expected, the  stalks in many fields averaging over 1 foot in height; potatoes in the city  are almost an entire failure, tho' in the Settlements and on the farm-  ing lands there will be a moderate crop. Beets are doing well so far  as we have heard; altogether we shall reap a much more abundant  harvest than the drouth could have allowed us to anticipate.    Many bushels of currants have been raised in the city this  season, and as I was the chairman of the awarding committee on   Fruit appointed by the Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society,  I had the opportunity of seeing many beautiful specimens, considering  that the currants have generally been brought wild from the kanyons,   and very few as yet been raised from the seed. We consider currants   very well adapted for our climate. A few ripe apricots and plums  have also been exhibited. Several beds of strawberries have yielded abundantly.  Prof. Carrington had a seedling peach tree which bore a few peaches this season  which were ripe on the 23rd. curt. He has a very fine bearing peach or-  chard. We are budding extensively from several of the best varieties of  apples and peaches which have been brought from the States. I will have  about 400 buds put in this season in my own orchard of apples, peaches,  apricots, plums & almonds. I will have a few good apples this season  also a few bunches of Grapes. It is the first season that my orchard  has commenced bearing. Prest. Youngs orchard is bearing well this  season and I would judge his young vineyard would produce more than  a ton of grapes. 
 A company returned from Carson Valley last evening—rather  dull times there; they report Murray and Reddin (I think brother  to Jack Reddin) killed by the Indians. I think Murray was   the one tried last winter for Murder.    Our wheat crops have come in quite well; corn looks middling  well; Potatoes have mostly run to tops this season—I think the   crop will be light.    Brother Isaac Chase is quite sick with a fever, and brother  Thurston has been very sick of late with rheumatism, but is   getting better.    As concerning Fruit I would say President Young  will have, I think, 20, or 30.00 lbs of Grapes; some apple trees  hang full, and a middling crop of peaches. I have some  very large fine seedling apples, 1/2 bushel of plums, a fair crop  of peaches &c. Your trees are growing very well, I have   trimmed them some. We have about 20 different kinds of   apples from the States now growing in this Valley, which   we are spreading as fast as we can.    I have sent a list of fruit to the Hon J. M. Bernhisel  to procure for us at the Linnaean Gardens and Nursery of  Wm. R. Prince & Co., at Flushing near New York—about 50  kinds of fruit for the benefit of our Territory.    Your family are all well. Sister Smith was at a   Melon party at my house on Wednesday evening, and   enjoyed herself well. Geo. A is diligently at work in the  Printing Office: I wish thousands of the boys of this Territory   were following the same example by learning a trade of   some kind. 
 States do not know what awaits them—that dismal, awful   trumendous storm which has been gathering for years will   assuredly burst, and fall upon the people of the United States   with a force that will carry death, sorrow and woe to many   thousands of her inhabitants, and it is nigh at their doors   as true as their is a God in Israel—whether Utah lives or   dies.    We are, as a general thing in good health and spirits:   Our wheat and other crops are coming in middling good.    Mrs Foss and family are well. Remember us to all   our friends. I hope we shall hear from you from time to   time.    Your truly   W. Woodruff 
 have been this season, for the starving people commenced  upon the grain before it was ripe—worms are destroying  the potatoes and corn a good deal.    It is a general time of health, except I am a good   ^deal^ troubled with the rheumatism in my right leg.    Tintick and his band are in a valley west of Tooele  Valley. It is expected that he will visit the settlements again  soon. Arropene, Ammon and others were with us on Sunday  all well with them. Our settlement is broken up at Salmon  River by the grasshoppers, who have eaten up every green thing  They will probably go there again when they make a raise  of more provisions    The California Mail came in on the 29th inst. The  Eastern Mail came in the last night, and brought me your letter  of June 7th, with your bills of lading, and goods, and letter  of instructions &c, all of, which I will attend to, to the best of   my ability.    Bro Houtz did not give me any of the book money;  He brought me a bill of settlement, or balance sheet of the Mill;  charged you some $80 for wall tax—was some $70 due on  the balance. I intend to see brother Houtz and tell him  that he must do his duty towards you in this matter more  honestly and promptly, or I shall have to make a church  matter of it, if I do not take a course of law with him. I  shall send to Mr Scovil, at Provo, for a copy of the agreement  next mail. I will do all I can in your matters.    Brother Cain is getting better, I am happy to say.  He told me the cows were in a good pasture; one of them 
 The yellow corn proves to be the earliest of any I have  seen in the valley, it got dead ripe in 80 days; it will  prove a valuable corn in this valley, I think; I have  saved it all for seed: I think it will yeild well.    I have just paid Miss Burbage (Now Mrs Long)  another bill of $6. for schooling.    Bro. Bernhisel, I wish you would do me a favor  which will be a benefit to the whole community, and it is  this; you have forwarded me from R. Prince and Co's Cata-  logue of fruit trees, and I believe they have as good a selection  as there is in the United States, and I wish to obtain  some cuttings from their Nursery. We obtained a few  varieties of choice apples from the States last spring, which  were grafted, and we are now butdding from them, but we  want other varieties, but I cannot send silver or gold by  mail with safety, and we have no bills. I forward with this   a list of what I wish to obtain: we have wanted 22 kinds  of apples, 6 kinds of pears, 8 of plums, 7 of cherries, 2 of  Quinces, 2 of Currants, 1 of Gooseberry, 1 Blackberry, and  2 of Grapes. I see from his advertisement that he will  forward grafts for about $1 per 100,—25 cents per parcel, or  50 cents per doz, but I do not want more than two or three  cuttings of each kind, and if we have two of each kind  that would take $1, and there were three it would be  $1 50/100; but if they charge as much for one or two, as they  would for three of each, it would be well to get three of a  kind. I wish you would write to Wm R. Prince &Co, and  forward them a bit of what I send you, and learn what the 
 The Eastern Mail came in last night at 9 o'clock;  brought the journals of all your travels to St Louis as a   company, which was very interesting.    A man arrived here yesterday driving 4000  Mexican sheep on the way for California: he wanted   to get them sheared here, and sell the wool, and sheep  too, if he could. He asked $[2] each for his sheep: I do not  think he will get it here.    I shall be pleased to hear from you at any time.

There   will be premiums awarded for the best of each named  class; also for the best essays on Agriculture, Horticulture,  Pomology and Home Manufactures. We expect the fair will  be extensive as the occasion    Bro Willes, the Territorial Inspector of Schools  has returned from a tour to the North, and reports the favorable  results consequent upon the coöperation of the authorities   in the various settlements; also the establishment of Sabbath  Schools and the organization of Literary Societies.

We have about 20 different kinds of   apples from the States now growing in this Valley, which   we are spreading as fast as we can.    I have sent a list of fruit to the Hon J. M. Bernhisel  to procure for us at the Linnaean Gardens and Nursery of  Wm. R. Prince & Co., at Flushing near New York—about 50  kinds of fruit for the benefit of our Territory.    Your family are all well. Sister Smith was at a   Melon party at my house on Wednesday evening, and   enjoyed herself well. Geo. A is diligently at work in the  Printing Office: I wish thousands of the boys of this Territory   were following the same example by learning a trade of   some kind. 
 Great Salt Lake City, July 31st 1856    To the Editor of the Luminary,    Dear Sir,    Another month of hard times has rolled into eternity, and  I again renew my correspondence with you. The drouth of the summer   has been mercifully relieved by 3 or 4 pleasant thunder showers during   the past week, which has proved a blessing to the crops, for the corn now  looks a little more pleasant, the shriveled leaves uncurling themselves   finely, and the farmers feel a little more cheerful than they did a  fortnight ago.    The prospects are decidedly gloomy, many fields of wheat are not   a foot high, and the tobacco worm and caterpillar have swept many  fields of potatoes in various locations. The corn in many places is   infested with a grub which destroys the grain while in its milky  tender condition, and to crown the entire calamities, Jack Frost came  on the 23rd June and nipt the corn and potatoes; and then as if  to make sure work he came again on the nights of July 16th & 17th, and   left his marks more plain on the corn and potatoes, the squash, and   cane grass.    About 3 weeks since G. S. L. City was visited by a flight of grasshoppers  which fortunately did not remain any considerable length of time.    Although the above is somewhat a gloomy prospect, still we are  [c]heered by the harvesters cutting down their wheat, where it is sufficiently  ripe. In addition to the hand labor, we have in the territory two of   McCormick's reapers which give entire satisfaction to some, whilst others  do not like them much. The people are most anxious to secure wheat   enough for themselves; and those who have a portion above their necessities, 
 Historian's office  G. S. L. City Augt. 30, 1856    Ed. of the Mormon,    Dear Sir,    The Eastern mail arrived on the evening of the   28th, inst., bringing Mormons up to the 12th July—considerable news   from our Washington delegation, and the Eastern country.    The weather continues dry and favorable for harvesting. Our   wheat crops have proved much better than we had estimated on ac-  count of the drouth, and the scanty supply of water from the creeks.   Potatoes in the city on the higher land are genererally a failure; on the   lower and Farming lands, there are moderate crops; having mostly   grown to tops. Corn crops in many places look well. We probably   will reap a much larger amount of grain than possibly could have   been calculated upon during the dry summer. The wheat has filled   remarkably well out in the ear notwithstanding the stalks were so   small that in many instances the Farmers have had to pull   their grain instead of cutting it.    The health of the people during the past season has been   remarkably good.    During this month Elder Parley P. Pratt and a few   bretheren have been appointed on missions to the States. Thomas  Bullock, Bernard Snow and several others to Europe. They expect  to start on or about the 10th of Sep.    On the 10th curt. the first division of Elder P. C. Merrill's  coy. came into the city, and since the balance have arrived; being the   first company of our emigration this season.    The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society hold their   first annual Fair in this ciy, commencing on 1st October; at which there  will be an exhibition of stock, agricultural products, Farming and 
 had eaten poison, and been very poor, but was recruiting.  He intended to get them up this fall, and get up Sister  Bernhisel's wood; if he does not do it, I shall get her  wood up for her, or see that it is done. I think I can  get along without making any draft upon you; the  only push is now, as I have no money at present, and  shall not have till I can sell some of my wheat or flour  as soon as I can thrash it. It will not be long first.  I shall employ your thrashing machine to thrash my  grain.    Yours truly.   W. Woodruff 
 expence will be, and have him put them up in a tin box  and solder it tight, and have him send it to you at Wash-  ington, or wherever you may reside at the time. I suppose  they should be cut in the month of January or February, so  that we can get them by Spring, but I want to write in  Season so that they can be attended to. We have sent for  some before, but the person instead of putting them in a   tin box and soldering it up air tight, put them in a wooden  box, and they all spoiled, except those that had been sent   in a tin box, which had kept good. I wish when you get  them that you would direct the box to me, and then put one  or two papers in it with directions on each, so that if one gets  worn out another may remain, and send it to me: this is by  the request of the Agricultural and Manufacturing Society  it is for the benefit of the whole Territory; whatever the expense  is please let me know, and charge it to me, and I will pay all  expenses. I wish to have each package of cuttings marked so  that I can know what kind of fruit it is when it comes. I shall  also write to Wm R. Prince &Co, upon the the subject.    The Eastern Mail arrived on the 28th. I received  letters from you and Geo. A. Smith. I was with the President  till 1/2 past 10 o'clock hearing the Washintgton and other letters  read; your joint letter to President Young shows the dark  state of the political Horizon; all right, there is a God in  Israel who will guide the storm and pay every man and  Nation their just due; and may God Almighty hasten it is  my prayer; the words of Joseph, Brigham and the prophets  are fulfuilling. 
 Great Salt Lake City, July 31st, 1856    To the Editor of the Mormon,    Dear Sir,    In the midst of the hurry of harvest we devote a short  time to write you a few items of what is transpiring in this blest Territory.  It is well known to all the civilized world that we are located in the   valleys of the great American Basin, some portions of the rim rising   from eleven to sixteen thousand feet above the level of the sea; therefore   we are isolated from "the rest of the mankind," having but little communication  with the world, for if our friends write to us, it is a risk whether the letters  come to this city or not, and therefore as a general thing we have nobody   to write to. The weather for the past month has been excessively dry, with   the exception of some three showery days which was a great relief not   only to the saints but to vegetation; they gave a renewal of life and   vigor to all. The streams are comparatively dry, and we are bound   to acknowledge the hand of God in all things; for it is miraculous that   there is any wheat at all, fmany fields of it not having grown a foot   high, yet the ears being tolerably well filled. The potatoes too are in   many places cut down to the earth by an army of caterpillers and   tobacco worms; the drouth in other places causes the vines to wilt, and   on examination there are no potatoes at the roots.    In addition to all these calamities, Jack Frost visited the low lands   on the 23rd June, and as though he really thought the people did not   believe he could come on the shortest night of the year, he visited many   fields of corn, potatoes, and vines on the nights of the 16th & 17th July,  and left his icy mark wherever he went, for vegitation wilted under his   rude embrace. 
 a few others have been appointed on Missions to the States  Thomas Bullock, Bernard Snow, and some others to  Europe. Jonathan Grimshaw has left the Historian's Office  and returned to England upon his own responsibility and business    The Agricultural & Manufacturing Society hold their   Annual fair, on the 1st October, at which there will be an  exhibition of Stock, Agricultural products, Farming and   Gardening Implements, Manufactures, Ladies Work, Machinery  and Fruit. A ploughing match will take place on the   Governor's Land near the City, about conference time. There   will be premiums awarded for the best of each named  class; also for the best essays on Agriculture, Horticulture,  Pomology and Home Manufactures. We expect the fair will  be extensive as the occasion    Bro Willes, the Territorial Inspector of Schools  has returned from a tour to the North, and reports the favorable  results consequent upon the coöperation of the authorities  in the various settlements; also the establishment of Sabbath  Schools and the organization of Literary Societies.    Among other improvements in the city a new Baptismal  Font is now being built near the Endowment House in   the Temple Block.    Yours Truly,  W. Woodruff 
 Historian's Office, G. S. L. City  Sept 4th 1856.    Editor of the Standard   Dear Sir,    The Eastern Mail arrived  on the evening of the 28th ult, Bringing letters and papers  from our delegates in Washington &c, which gave us a general  account of the of the state of the political atmosphere, and the general  news of the day. The California mail arrived on the 1st inst;  bringing us the "Standard" up to July 26th, and other papers   and letters from our western friends. It is truly a treat to us  to hear once a month what is going on in the lower world,   East, West, North and South. We truly feel to bid you God  speed in your noble effort in lifting up and maintaining   a "Standard" in the West; and we pray the Lord to raise   you up friends and means that you may be sustained   in so worthy an undertaking; for having been very freely  represented for twenty years, in many parts of the world,   we now esteem it a great blessing to have the privilege of  representing ourselves. We men find a slight difference  between being represented by friends or enemies, especially   as the Latter Day Saints.    We did not hear by the last mail much from our  hand cart trains. Governor Young has sent out teams  with a large amount of flour, to meet them.    It is a general time of health throughout our Territory. 
 President Young is extending his high stone wall around   all around his Mansion and garden. President Kimball  has built a fine granary with cobble stones laid in cement  and his extending his wall all around his premises.    The New Historians Office is progressing finely; the   plasterers last night finished their work on it, it will   soon be ready for us to go into.    I hope we shall hear from you often.    We wish to be remembered to you.    As Ever, I remain  Yours truly,   W Woodruff 
 will be very careful to store it away. They are also in hopes that the   corn and potatoes will yet turn out pretty good, so that all saints who come  to the valleys this fall may be sustained.    One blessing has been conferred upon us by some apostates who left  here for St. Louis this spring, and reported their doleful tales to all the  Emigrants who are bound for the gold mines; which caused them to take  the cut off east of Bridger's Fort. By this means the great droves of cattle  which would otherwise have thronged our streets, and used up all the grass in  the neighborhood of the city and the northern settlements, have passed by.    If they had come this way it would of necessity have caused the citizens  to have sent their cattle eight miles for feed; we are thankful for even this  small favor.    The 24th July was passed by the Presidency and a select company up at  the head waters of the Big Cottonwood Creek, several thousand feet above   the valley; they had a splendid and agreeable time, the particulars of   which you will see in the Deseret News of 30th July. Those present were   invited ^by Prest Young^ to meet again at 4 p.m of the 23rd July 1857 at the same place,   together with such others as he may invite. He expressed himself that it was  the freest, happiest celebration he has participated in, as no formality had  been manifested on the occasion, and every person felt well.    You will be sorry to hear that the milk weeds have taken almost universal  possesion of that portion of your farm on the west side of and adjoining  the State road, and most of the trees that you had caused to be planted  are destroyed by the cattle grazing there breaking them down, or by  wagons being driven against them by careless drivers.    We are not experiencing such excessive, unbearable hot weather this  summer as yet, although it has been very dry with the exception of three  or four days. The people are generally enjoying good health, and all are  in good spirits and cheerful. 
 Gardening implements, Manufactures, Ladies work, Machinery and Fruits.  A ploughing match will take place on the Governors lands near the  city about conference time. There will also be premiums awarded for  the best Essays on agriculture, Horticulture, Pomology, and home man-  ufactures.    A fair on such an extended scale will be a novalty in Utah  and elicit from the genius and enterprize of her citizens such specimens  and productions, as no doubt will lend greatly to enhance the cause of  agriculture and home manufactures.    In the various wards of the city, and throughout the Territory  auxillary societies are being formed, to facilitate the accomplishment  of the objects of the Institution; and to a people so remote and  isolated from the commercial world, to does not require much logic  to show them, the majority of sustaining themselves by producing and  Manufacturing what they consume.    Several bretheren have left the valley this season, some say they  intend to return when the "times" become better.    Br. S. M. Blair and compy. start on monday first for Ruby valley  where he expects to meet br. Enoch Reese and coy. from Carson, the design   is to explore a new route to Carson by way of Rye valley.    I have sent by this mail to the Linnaen Gardens New York   for cions of fifty different kinds of Fruit, which I have selected from   Prince & Coys. catalogue, with which I intend budding my orchard next  season. I have put in 100 buds this Fall, of various fruits, some  of varieties brought from the States, some from California, and others  from seedlings which have been proven here, and are commended by   Fruit culturists. Many currants have been raised this season, considered

Dear Bro:    Yours of Feb 26th addressed  to Fillmore City and informing me of my call to   Tahiti, has been forwarded to me.    I have been preparing myself for a Medical Course  and intended entering Harvard College this coming September.  Of course I feel like doing what I can to farther   the cause of our Gospel, and if, in view of my  plans you think that I should accept this call   could my mission be changed to Europe?    I have people in England, and I am some-  what acquainted with the German Language  having taken at course in German @ the B. Y. A.  Provo.    Now I leave the matter in your hands whether   I take my course at Harvard first or the mission.    Awaiting your reply I am  Your Bro. in the Gospel.  Collie Robison  P. O. Box 68.

 If such a continued scene of trials were to be poured out upon any   other people in any part of the world, they would be entirely discouraged   and would vacate their farms; sometimes we hear a sound as of people   in the lower world wanting to live inn these upper valleys, but if this people   were to vacate them in 1857, there is no other people that would be compelled   to live in these mountains for two years; for they would perish either by   famine or by killing each other in quarrelling about the water to irrigate  their fields, so you can proclaim boldly a few naked truths to enlighten  those who are now sitting in Egyptian darkness on the subject of this ex-  alted Territory.    I have seen Sister Taylor this morning; she and all your family   are enjoying good heath and spirits.    Yours truly,   W. Woodruff    T. B.

 There have been a few cases of small pox in a camp that  came in from the Mississippi    Our wheat harvest is gathered, and their is much more  wheat gathered than could have been expected considering  the drouth. We have but very little trouble this season  with the grasshoppers. Our corn looks very well, potatoe  crop very light, where the ground was wet enough to   produce a crop, they have run a good deal to vines.    Bro S. M. Blair and Company started on Monday  last to explore a new route to Carson County, by way of  Ruby valley. He anticipates meeting Bro Enoch C Reese and   a company from Carson, at Ruby valley    During the past month, Elder Parley P. Pratt, and   a few brethren have been appointed missions to the States;  Thomas Bullock, Bernard Snow, and several others to   Europe. The Company are now making preparations  and expect to start on the 10th.    The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing  Society have been exerting a very favorable influence for   the encouragement of home manufactures in the Territory.   Numerous auxiliary branches are being formed in the various  wards of the City and throughout the Territory. Their fair  or exhibition will begin on the first of October, when we  expect to see the home manufactures of Deseret appear to  advantage. Theire will also be an exhibition of Stock,   produce and Fruit, also a ploughing match which will  serve as a great stimulus for the encouragement of home arts  and the establishment of this people on an independent com-

 strawberries and peaches, and there will be a few apples, Grapes,  apricots, plums &c.    Prest. Young is building a cobble stone wall averaging 10  feet in height around his noble orchard and vineyard; enclosing  his mansion, offices, and new house. I presume he will gather  between twenty and thirty hundred lbs of Grapes this season; many  of his apple trees are heavily loaded, and he will have a fair  crop of peaches.    Prest. Kimball has built a Granary of cobble stones laid in   Deseret cement 34 feet by 24, two stories high, with a floor over 1 foot   deep of cobble stones also laid in cement; the design is to make it   vermin proof.    Prest. Grant in company with Brothers Thurston and Stoker  have opened a new farm in Weber valley, the crops are very  promising.    The new Historian' office is plastered and we expect to remove  there soon, which will be a decided change for the better to the clerks  as well as myself.    Br. Willes—the Territorial Inspector of Schools—has returned   from the North and reports the favorable results consequent upon the   co-operation of the authorities in the various settlements, also the   establishment of sabbath schools, and the organization of Literary Societies.    A company has just returned from carson valley; as far as   we could learn, all of the company who went in the spring arrived   in peace and safety; we were informed that Murray who was tryed last  winter for murder and ran away, was killed by the Indians, also   a man by the name of George Redding. yours truly,    W.

 mercial basis. The community are fast becoming unable  to sustain the merchants in importing such heavy trains  of goods and merchandize, and are thereby becoming   obliged to foster our own manufacturers and mechanics,   who are abundantly able, if encouraged, to compete with   the imported merchandize. It is true we lack staples which   are necessary for any peoples prosperity; and until the  same are produced in or near our Territory, in sufficient  quantities, we must import more or less; but with the iron  works going ahead, the increasing flocks of sheep, the  excellence of our Flax, and the establishment last season  of a cotton raising company on the Rio Virgin, and the   amount of commodities which exist in inexhaustible quantities  in our Territory, we will soon have all the facilities within  reach which are desirable, and the people are waking  up to the importance of the subject.    The Horticultural Society Meetings and exhibitions  of Fruit, and the success which has been realized by  Fruit culturists have been the means of creating a general  interest in behalf of fruit culture in the city, on lots suitably  adapted, although as you are aware, the Presidency, many   of the Twelve, and leading citizens have been doing their  utmost since our arrival here, and have very promising  orchards. Some fruit cuttings which you sent last spring  were grafted into the trees, and have lived and are  doing finely, and they have already supplied many buds  which have been distributed to several orchards.

Woodruff and Counseller,    Dear Brethren,  In compliance with your request for missionaries in a   letter of the 18th Dec. I herewith send you the names of  eight, but I have learned since the names were entered  upon the blank that Bro. Niels Johnson is not in   financial circumstances to go, I have not spoken  with him or any of the brethren as it has been my  instructions not to do so, but there being a space in the   blanks for the information as to the time they will be  ready to go I see that some of the Bishops have spoken   with the brethren and incerted that information.    Now in endorsing these brethren for missions I   do it entirely upon the recommendation of their Bishops  and what I can learn incidently about them    Without meeting them and talking with them  this is the best I can do. I have always tried to be  as careful as possible to get worthy men for missionaries  but in most cases I have to depend upon the word of  the Bishops, and if the Bishop does not communicate  directly with the men themselves he is not able to indorse

Salt Lake, Utah.    Dear Brethren;    Sisters Inez Knight and   Jennie Brimhall, daughters of  Jesse Knight,  and Geo. H Brim-  hall, respectively, will start for   England next Saturday in com-  pany with some others. The object  of their going is to visit, to gather  genealogy, and to study.    These young sisters ^are^ about twenty-  one years of age, are graduates of   the B. Y. Academy, (the latter a teacher  B. Y. A.) and both are women of   much faith, and are quite well  versed in the principles of the   Gospel.    We feel to suggest that they  be called upon a mission to   and be set apart for that 
 as well as in England    I had thought to be   able to lecture my way   through to your City, but  general indifference of the  local Pastors, have made  that course impossible as   they would not grant me  their places of worship to  lecture in. I am now   spent out my means are  gone, I am in a lodging  with my Wife and Child   and have no second suit  and am without means  or food.    I write you to ask if  you will have my case  considered by the Saints  and send me some  immediate assistance

February, 1897.    TO THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.    HON. SIRS,    After calling your attention to the "Certificate of Two Witnesses,"  herewith, I, the most unworthy servant of The Most High God, think it will  be easy for you to understand, that in writing to you, and explaining these   requirements, my title to do is exceeding that of Queens, Kings, Governments  or Peoples, because I write, as no other living man dare write, "in the  Name of The LORD thy GOD! Maker of Heaven and Earth! The Sea  and all that in them is!"    "FIRST." — "That you free the 'First Day' of the week, commonly called  'Sunday,' from all restrictions which are not put upon the  Second to the Sixth Days, 'First Day' being one of the   days of which The LORD says, 'Thou shalt do thy   work.'"    "SECOND." — "That the book called 'Common Prayer' be divested of   Government authority."    "THIRD." — "That the word 'Church,' used to describe a building which is  the work of men's hands, be divested of Government  authority."    I, the most unworthy servant of The Most High, am directed by  the Eternal Spirit to sign, with love from God the Father and the Lord  Jesus Christ,    EDWARD GRIFFITH.

C., on January the 25th, 1896, When I saw  a glistering brightness radiation from his face, and his eyes became a flaming fire, in size,  appearing as that of an ordinary saucer, and I heard the words which came through his  mouth, saying in a majestic manner: "I AM! The LORD thy GOD! Maker of Heaven  "and Earth! the Sea and all that in them is." I immediately covered my face with my  hand, because I could not endure to look upon the excessive dazzling brightness.    Mabel Waller    I, EDWARD GRIFFITH, being a witness to the power and voice of the Eternal  Father, make Oath and swear by Him that liveth for ever and for ever, That on January the   25th, 1896, I was in my Office, at 42, Basinghall Street, London, E. C., When I noticed a   peculiar incandescence radiating in the atmosphere. At the moment I was engaged in  conversation, When suddenly I felt a force through my left side, which penetrated to the   centre of my body; the force turned upward and came through my throat, and over my  tongue, my body and face extending by the introduced power, and I was astonished to hear  words, without aid or assistance upon my part, proclaimed through the introduced power,  saying: "I AM! The LORD thy GOD! Maker of Heaven and Earth! The Sea and  "all that in them is!"    The Eternal Spirit, thus introduced, after the space of a few moments, withdrew again  from my body: yet continued many days speaking with me, by His Voice in my ear.    Edward Griffith  Dartmouth N.

 council is "Marriage Relation"   I will be candid in stating   my reasons for writing.    Almost a year ago my second  cousin and I were strangely thrown  in each others company and despite  our efforts to throw aside such  thoughts, a mutual feeling was  reciprocated and it seemed that we  could not drive it from us.    We parted, however, with a   determination to forget if possible.    We have prayed that if it  was wrong, that this passion  might be quenched, but the  answer seemed to come that  such had to be, for this feeling,  although we were seperated, se[e]med  to grow to a passionate love.    There is no discord among our  parents, who seem to think if

 if this love is mutual we were  destined for each other.    We met again a few days  ago and talked the matter over  and decided to submit it to   your council. There are many  who say that it is wrong for  second cousins to enter in to  the marriage covenant, and others  say it is not. We cannot become  satisfied as we can get no deffinite  answer.    We desire to do what is   right in all things and unless  it is the Lord's will, we cannot  give each other up.    Bro. Woodruff, is it wrong  that we should get married?

 THE DESERET NEWS.  67    trouble should be about keeping the  commandments of God that we may be  justified before the Lord as Caleb and  Joshua were. [##Numbers 14:6-30##] Our blessings will depend  upon our acts; they will be withheld as  long as we are careless about God's com-  mands, but as soon as we yield implicit  obedience thereto they will be multi-  plied on our heads. This we shall find   to be true.    I desire to see Zion rise, and the Lat-  ter-day Saints prospered and blessed. I  want their prayers day and night for  Zion, for the Priesthood and the king-  dom of God. Pray for the Lord to make  bear His arm in carrying out His pro-  mises made to Abraham, Isaac and  Jacob, Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh  concerning their seed in the last dispen-  sation. Pray for your enemies; let them  have the benefit of your prayers, the  Lord knows they shall have the benefit  of mine day and night. We are com-  manded in His word to pray for our  enemies, and I believe the Latter-day  Saints do pray for theirs, and I have more  faith in the prayers of this people before  God in getting power to build up Zion  and overthrow her enemies than in all  the weapons of war in the world. I  would not feel so if I had no faith in  God; but the fact is, there is a God in  Israel. He has created the earth and  He rules over it and it is His right so to  do, for it is His footstool, and He is com-  ing to reign upon it. And everything  that we do here in attending to the or-  dinances of His house prepares the way  for, and aids in the accomplishment of  that work. It is now thirty-seven years  since this church was organized, and   all that time it has been slowly progress-  ing. The Elders of Israel, the Twelve,  Seventies, High Priests and Bishops  have traveled abroad among the nations  preaching the gospel, and every man  who has been baptized, every sin over-  come, every city warned, every nation  in which the gospel has been preached  has been so much accomplished in pre-  paring for the coming of Christ; every  temple, school-house, village or city  that we build, every acre of ground that  we dedicate to the Lord, every step we  take, however small it may be, has its  weight in preparing for the coming of  the Son of man. We are not going to  build up Zion in a day; though the  Scriptures say a nation shall be born in  a day, nor will the kingdom of God be  built in a day; but we must labor every  day as it comes, and so we gain a little  and keep gaining, and the Lord is going  to labor with us. Let us not be dis-  couraged but do good as we have op-  portunity, and try to overcome our sins  and imperfections, and set not our  hearts on the things of this life so that   they may draw us away from the com-  mandments of God. Inasmuch as we  do this we will increase in power and  dominion, and the kingdom of our God  will spread itself abroad until the law of  God shall go from Zion as well as the   word of the Lord from Jerusalem, and  God shall dictate among all the child-  ren of men. This is our work, and in  no greater can we be engaged; it is a  labor worthy of God, angels and Saints.    Brethren and sisters I do not wish to  occupy any more of your time this morn-  ing.  I feel well with regard to the work  of God. I rejoice in the Lord, I know  that God lives and reigns.  I know this  is His people, and that this kingdom is  His kingdom. I know this is a very  wicked generation and that the judg-  ments of God are at their doors, and  unless they speedily repent that they  will suffer a great deal more for their  sins than the Saints have for trying to  keep the commandments of God. I  pray that the Lord will prepare us for  that which awaits us and the world, that  we may have the favor of God, enjoy the  Holy Ghost, and that the spirit of truth  may direct us in all the acts of life, for  Jesus' sake. Amen. 
 DISCOURSE   DELIVERED BY  ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  IN THE  Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sunday  Afternoon, June 6th, 1880.    REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE    I have a desire to be heard in what  I say to this assembly. I know the  difficulties there are in speaking  here. It requires not only attention,  but quietude among the people.    I feel disposed to read a few verses  from this good old book the Bible—  some of the sayings of Isaiah and   Ezekiel. -[The speaker then read  from the 12th chapter of Ezekiel,   from the 21st verse to the end of the  chapter.]- I have (the speaker con-  tinued) a few reflections upon my  mind that I would like to lay before   the Latter-day Saints, especially   those who bear the holy priesthood.  Among the lessons which we are  learning in our day and time is this   one truth: that we all of us need the   spirit of revelation in order that we   may teach mankind of the things of   God. I do not believe myself there  ever was a man lived in the flesh on  the earth in any day or age of   the world, no matter what his position,  calling, name, or age might be—I do   not believe any man ever had the   power to do the work of God, to   build up his kingdom, or to edify the   souls of men, without inspiration   and revelation; for the Lord has   never called any man in any age of  the world to do any of this kind of   work, whether to preach the gospel,   to prophesy, or to declare the word  of the Lord to the inhabitants of the  earth, or to administer in any ordi-  annce in any temple or in any ta-  bernacle, without the holy priest-  hood. There are no ordinances ac-  ceptable in the sight of God of any   force after death, or in the eternal   worlds except those ordinances that  are performed by men bearing the  holy priesthood. Our heavenly  Father himself has officiated by this   principle in the creation of all   worlds, in the redemption of all  worlds, and in all the work   which he has performed; it has  all been done by the power of the  Godhead and the holy priesthood,   which is without beginning of days  or end of years. This priesthood has   power with the heavens. It has as-  sociation with the heavens. The  heavens are connected with this   priesthood, let it rest upon the shoul-  ders or head of any man, whether it   be Jesus Christ, or those fishermen,  or the ancient patriarchs or prophets   or Joseph Smith, or any other man  who is called of God as was Aaron,  by revelation, and prophecy to bear  record of the name of God in any age  of the world. Therefore, I occupy  the same position myself. I know I   need the Spirit of God. I know you   do. I know any man does who   rises on this stand, and attempts to   teach the people. You give a man  the inspiration of Almighty God and  the eternal truths of heaven and he   can instruct and edify the children   of men upon the principles of life   and salvation; without this he can-  not do it. And in order to present  to my brethren and sisters and   friends the subject that I have on   my mind, I will just refer a little  further to some words of the Lord to   the Prophet Ezekiel. -[The speaker  again referred to the Book of Eze-  kiel, and quoted from the 9th, 14th  and 33rd chapters, all of parts quoted   having reference to the dealings of   God with the wicked.]- Continuing,   Elder Woodruff said: Now, having   quoted all these passages of Scrip-  ture, I want to say to my brethren   the Apostles, the High Priests, the   Seventies, the Elders of Israel, who   bear the holy priesthood, upon whose   shoulders the God of heaven, in this  day and generation has placed the  responsibility of the Melchisedec  and Aaronic Priesthood, has placed  the responsibility of this great and  last dispensation and fulness of  times, has placed the responsibility   of the building up of the great kingdom  of God which Daniel saw by revela-  tion, vision and inspiration in his   day and generation as proclaimed   by all the prophets and apostles who   have written in this book, in the  stick of Judah as well as in the stick   of Joseph and other revelations giv-  en to us through the mouth of the  prophets and apostles in our day  and generation—I want to ask in  the face of all this—and I take it   home to myself—what position are  we in before high heaven, before   God the Father, before his son Jesus   Christ, before the heavenly hosts,   before all justified spirits made per-  fect from the creation of the world  to this day? What condition are we   in as the servants of the living  God, men holding the holy priest-  hood into whose hands the God of   Israel has given this kingdom. Are   we disseminating the mighty flood   of revelation and prophecy in these  records and these books which are   now to rest upon the generation as   in the days of Noah and Lot. In   this respect are we justified in the  sight of God, in the sight of heaven,  in the sight of angels, and in the   sight of men? Can we fold our  arms in peace and cry "all is peace  in Zion," when, so far as we have  the power of the priesthood resting   upon us, we can see the condition of   the world? Can we imagine that  our garments will be clean without   lifting our voice before our fellow-  men and warning them of the   things that are at their doors? No,   we cannot. There never was a set   of men since God made the world  under a stronger responsibility to   warn this generation, to lift up our  voices long and loud, day and night  so far as we have the opportunity   and declare the words of God unto   this generation. We are required to   do this. This is our calling. It is our  duty. It is our business. We have   had to perform this work for the   last 50 years of our lives. When the  Lord called Joseph Smith to lay the  foundation of this Church he called  him in fulfilment of many revelations  given in other dispensations of men.   He was preserved by the hand of   God to come forth in the last days,   even in the dispensation of the ful-  ness of times. He was a prophet of  the living God. He was a prophet,   seer and revelator. The Lord called   upon him to do the work for which  he was ordained before the founda-  tion of this world. He did all that   was required of him, and he was  surrounded with thousands of men  who were acquainted with his life,   and with the spirit and power of  God which rested upon him, and   who sustained him in life and in   death. We know he was a prophet   of God, and we know he brought  forth the stick of Joseph, the Book   of Mormon, which was given unto  him by the angel of God. This  church and kingdom has been or-  ganized by the command of God   and by the revelations of heaven.   It has continued to grow and in-  crease, and has been upheld by the  Lord Almighty, from its organiza-  tion until the present hour. And   when I look at this tabernacle and   think of the words of the prophet   Isaiah, "that the mountain of the  Lord's house shall be established in  the tops of the mountains;" when I   look at these everlasting hills and   the land given by promise to father  Jacob and his posterity; when I see   this barren desert peopled by 150,000  Saints of the living God who have  been gathered from nearly every na-  tion under heaven through the pro-  clamation of the gospel of Jesus   Christ—what can I say about it?   Can I say it is a dream? Can I say   it is all a vision? Can I say that  this work is of man and not of God?   Can I say these are revelations and  prophecies which belong to some  other generation? I tell you no.  This is the kingdom of God.  Here  are the Saints of God.   These mountains are being filled  with the Latter-day Saints from  every nation under heaven, and with  these things before me I know that  it is my duty to preach the gospel,   to warn Saints and sinners wherever   I have the opportnnity.  The Lord   told Joseph Smith that he would   prove us in all things, whether we   would abide in his covenant even   unto death, that we might be found   worthy. The prophet sealed his  testimony with his blood. That tes-  timony is in force upon all the world   and has been from the day of his  death. Not one word of the Lord   shall pass away unfulfilled. The un-  belief in this generation will make   no difference with regard to the  building up of the kingdom of God.  As it was in the days of Noah so   shall also the coming of the Son of   Man be. Therefore, I desire to ask  my brethren, the Elders of Israel—  and I ask myself at the same time—  do we understand our position before  the Lord? Ezekiel has passed away.   He is in the spirit world. He has   received his resurrected body and   stands at the right hand of God with  other prophets and apostles who  lived in days gone by. They had   their day and generation. All these  patriarchs and prophets and apostles  had a time to prophesy, to preach, to  labor, and to administer in the or-  dinances of life and salvation. Now,   in this last dispensation, ye Elders   of Israel, this work has been put into  your hands. Therefore, what shall   we say, and what shall we do? Are  we acting as watchmen upon the  walls of Zion? If we are, are we  justified in closing our mouths, in   closing our ears, or in setting our  hearts upon anything else excepting   the building up of the kingdom of   God? I do not think we are. In my  view our responsibility is very great.  We should live our religion. We   should practice ourselves what we   preach. We should treasure up  the words of life. We should   search the records of divine   truth. We should seek to compre-  hend the day and age in which we  live. This is the way I look upon   our situation to-day. I do not look   upon the revelations recorded in  these books, touching the dispensa-  tion of the fulness of times, as some-  thing that will pass away unfulfill-  ed. We live in a generation when  great changes are about to take   place. We live in a time when   darkness covers the whole earth and   gross darkness the people. The  world are a great way from the   ruth. Infidelity overwhelms the  earth, in fact it is a hard matter to-  day to get either priest or people,   sect or party, of any name or denom-  ination under heaven to believe in  the literal fulfilment of the Bible, as   translated in the days of King   James, which contains the revela-  tions given from the days of Father   Adam down to our own time, and   which point out to us the signs of   heaven and earth indicating the  coming of the Son of Man. We live   in the generation itself when Jesus   Christ will come in the clouds of   heaven with power and great glory.   We live in the generation when the  gospel of Jesus Christ has been re-  vealed in its fulness to the Gentiles,  and when the gospel of Christ will  go to the house of Israel, to the de-  scendants of Lehi in fulfilment of   that which is recorded in their rec-  ords in the 9th, 10th and 11th chap-  ters of the last Book of Nephi. These   prophets spake by the power of God   and the inspiration of the Holy  Ghost, and as the Apostle says, "No  prophecy of the Scripture is of any   private interpretation. For the pro-  phecy came not in old time by the   will of man; but holy men of God  spake as they were moved by the  Holy Ghost." I feel therefore to say  to my brethren who bear the holy   priesthood, and I say it to myself  and to all—I do not think we   have much time to lay down  and slumber. We have no  time to speculate in trying to get   rich, in trying to accumulate gold   and silver. What we have got to   do is to build up the Kingdom of   God. As Apostles, High Priests,   Elders, Seventies and the lesser  priesthood, we are bound together  by this new and everlasting gospel  and covenant; we are called to per-  form the great and mighty work of   building up Zion, of building temples   wherein we may labor for the living   and the dead, and we should live in   that way and manner that we may  be governed and controlled at all   times by the Holy Spirit.    I know very well how the world  look at these things. As I said be-  fore, the world is far from the Lord.  We ourselves are too far from the  Lord as a people. We ought to   draw near to the Lord, and labor to  obtain the Holy Spirit, so that when  we read the revelations of God we  may read them by the same spirit  by which they were given. Then we  can understand their purport when  given to the children of men.    The Lord has said by the mouth   of the Prophet Isaiah, that he would  proceed to do a marvellous work and   a wonder; and when I look at the   rise and progress of this Church,   when I behold the great work the   Lord has performed, it was a marvel-  lous work and a wonder indeed.   There never has been, in my view,   any generation in which the same   amount of prophecies and important  events have to be fulfilled as in the  generation in which we live. Joseph  Smith, an illiterate boy, was raised  up by the power of God. His teach-  ers were the angels of heaven. He  was administered unto by the Son   of God. He received the Aaronic   priesthood of John the Baptist, who   was beheaded for the testimony of   Jesus Christ. He received the   Apostleship and Melchizedek priest-  hood under the hands of Peter,   James and John, who were also put   to death for the word and testimony  of Jesus Christ. He made use of   these ordinances by the command-  ment of God. He organized theChurch  and kingdom of God; he did that   which all the wisdom of the secta-  rian world could never have compre-  hended. He established the only  church on the face of the earth ac-  cording to the ancient order of the   Church of Jesus Christ, with apos-  tles, prophets, teachers, gifts, helps,   governments, baptism for the re-  mission of sins, the laying on of   hands for the reception of the Holy  Ghost—an organization which has   not existed on the earth from the   day the ancient apostles were put to  death, and the holy priesthood taken  from the earth, until the present.  This church has continued to rise.  It is the only true church upon the  face of the whole earth. Its history  is before the world. It has contin-  ued to grow and increase from the  day it was organized until the pres-  ent time. This is the Zion of God.   We see an embryo of it in these  valleys of the mountains, and it is   designed by the Most High God to   stand on the earth in power and   glory and dominion, as the prophets   of God saw it in their day and gen-  eration. This is the kingdom that  Daniel saw, and it will continue to   roll forth until it fills the whole   earth. These are eternal truths,   whether the world believe or disbe-  lieve them, it matters not, the   truths cannot be made of non effect.  This is certainly a strange work and  a wonder. There has been every ex-  ertion made to stay it. Armies have  been sent forth to destroy this peo-  ple; but we have been upheld and   sustained by the hand of the Lord  until to-day.    And now I desire to bear my testi-  mony. I have no fears, my brethren   and sisters—and I say the same to our   nation, to all kings, queens, emper-  ors, presidents and governments of  this world—I have no fears with re-  gard to "Mormonism," and the ulti-  mate triumph of the kingdom of  God; because the Lord Almighty  has said that the nation and king-  dom that will not serve him shall   perish and be utterly wasted   away. If this had not been the Zion   of God it would not have stood so  long as it has done. This kingdom,  however, has not been organized by  the power of man but by the power   of God, and whatever God under-  takes to do he will carry out. I have  therefore no fear of this kingdom. It  was ordained to come forth before   the world was made; and the Lord  never undertook a dispensation of   this kind without due preparation   before he commenced. He had ma-  terial in the spirit world who would   in time be raised up to carry on this  kingdom. I have no fears about  this work being accomplished, but I   have fears about many of the Lat-  ter-day Saints; because if we have   the holy priesthood upon our heads  and do not live our religion, of all   men we are under the greatest con-  demnation. We have baptized a   great many into this Church and   kingdom—not many, certainly, when   compared to the twelve hundred   million inhabitants of the earth—  but a great many have apostatized.   What! Latter-day Saints aposta-  tize! Yes. I tell you people will   apostatize who have received the   holy priesthood and Gospel of Jesus  Christ, if they do not honor God, if   they do not keep his com-  mandments, obey his laws and   humble themselves before the Lord;   they are in danger every day of their  lives. Look at the number of devils  we have round about us! We have   I should say, one hundred to every   man, woman and child. One-third   part of the heavenly host was cast   down to the earth with Lucifer, son  of the morning, to war against us—  which I suppose will number one  hundred million devils—and they   labor to overthrow all the saints and   the kingdom of God. They even   tried to overthrow Jesus Christ;   they overthrew Judas, and they   have succeeded in overthrowing a  good many Latter-day Saints, who  had a name and standing among us,   who undertook to build themselves   up instead of the kingdom of God  and when men having this priest-  hood—I do not care whether it was  in the days of Adam, in the days of   Moses, in the days of Joseph Smith,   or in the days of Brigham Young, I   care not in what day they lived—if  they bore this priesthood and under-  took to use it for any other purpose  than the building up of the kingdom   of God, then amen to the power and   priesthood of such men.    The Lord will have a people to   carry on his purposes who will obey   and serve him. He has a good many   people in this day and age of the   world, who will be faithful unto  death, whether called to seal their   testimony with their blood or not.  He has a people who will maintain   his work while they are here. But   here is the danger, ye Latter-day  Saints, and the Savior saw it very  plainly, and has left in on  record in the earth: He compared  the kingdon of God unto ten vir-  gins which took their lamps and   went forth to meet the bridegroom.  "And five of them were wise and   five were foolish. They that were  foolish took their lamps and took no  oil with them; But the wise took   oil in their vessels with their lamps.   While the bridegroom tarried, they   all slumbered and slept. And at   midnight there was a cry made,   Behold the bridegroom cometh; go   ye out to meet him. Then all those  virgins arose and trimmed their  lamps. And the foolish said unto   the wise, Give us of your oil; for our   lamps are gone out. But the wise   answered saying, Not so; lest there   be not enough for us and you; but   go ye rather to them that sell, and   buy for yourselves. And while they   went to buy, the bridegroom came,   and they that were ready went in   with him to the marriage; and the  door was shut. Afterwards came   also the other virgins, saying, Lord,  Lord, open to us. But he answered   and said, Verily I say unto you, I   know you not." Now, those who   have got oil in their lamps, are men   who live their religion, pay their  tithing, pay their debts, keep the  commandments of God, and do not  blaspheme his name; men and wo-  men who walk in the light of the   Lord; men and women who not   sell their birthright for a mess of  pottage or for a little gold or silver;   these are those that will be valiant   in the testimony of Jesus Christ.    This is the way I feel to-day. I  feel to warn my brethren and sisters,   the Latter-day Saints, to live their   religion, to trim their lamps, because  as the Lord lives his word will be  fulfilled. The coming of Jesus is   nigh at the door. These judgments   that I have read will come to pass,   and though Brigham, Joseph, Noah,  Daniel and Job, or anybody else  were in the land, they could not de-  liver their own souls by their right-  eousness. The man that is righte-  ous cannot save the wicked. We   have got to live our own righteous-  ness, that is keep the command-  ments of God.    We are approaching changes.  There are judgments at our door.   There are judgments at the door of   this nation, and at the door of Great   Babylon. How do the world feel  to-day? How does our nation feel?   Something similar to Belshazzar, the   king. On the night that he drank   out of the golden and silver vessels,   with his princes and his wives, he  thought, "Well, I made this coun-  try. I made this city. I am the god  of this country;" but when the   Lord Almighty manifested his   displeasure by the writing on the  wall, the scene was changed. His   kingdom was broken up and given  to the Medes and Persians. His  greatness, his gold and silver did not   save him. In the same way the  Lord in ancient days swept away  great cities when they were ripened in  iniquity. Jerusalem was overthrown  in fulfilment of the words of the   Lord. Jeremiah and Isaiah prophe-  sied what would come to pass, and it  was fulfilled to the very letter. So I   say to the Gentiles, so I say to the  Latter-day Saints. What the Lord  has spoken concerning our nation,  and concerning the nations of the  earth—notwithstanding that the  unbelief of the world may be great,   notwithstanding that they may re-  ject the word of God and seek to put  the servants of God to death—will  all be fulfilled. War, pestilence,   famine, earthquakes and storms  await this generation. These calam-  ities will overtake the world as God   lives, and no power can prevent   them. Therefore I say to the El-  ders of Israel, be faithful. We have  had the priesthood given to us, and   if we fail to use it aright, we shall be   brought under condemnation. There-  fore, let us round up our shoulders   and bear off the kingdom. Let us  labor to obtain the holy spirit—and  power of the gospel of Jesus Christ  —which has been put into our   hands, and inasmuch as we do this,  the blessing of God will attend our   efforts.    We have been here a number of   years. We have preached the gos-  pel and labored to build up this king-  dom. Many have been associated   with this Church almost from the  beginning. Many have been taken   away. Joseph and Hyrum sealed   their testimony with their blood.   Many have passed to the other side  of the vail, and many others of us   will soon follow them; but I do not   want when I get there to have it  said, "When you were in the flesh  you had the priesthood, you had the   power to rebuke sin, but you were   not man enough to chastise the un-  godly." Neither do I want my rela-  tives to rise up and say "You had   the power to do a work for the re-  demption of the dead, but you have  neglected these things." I do not  want these things to rise up against  me. As for gold and silver, they 
 DISCOURSE  BY   APOSTLE W. WOODRUFF,  DELIVERED  In the Assembly Hall, on Sunday   Afternoon, March 26th, 1882.  REPORTED BY G. F. GIBBS.    I feel disposed to read a few verses  from ##Doctrine and Covenants 43:17-35|section 43## of the Doctrine and   Covenants, a book containing the   revelations of God to the Latter-  day Saints, communicated through  the prophet Joseph Smith.    J120576 - 77(The speaker then read the whole   of the section, commencing at the 17th verse.)    J120577There is one thing I wish to say   to the congregation, and I would say  the same to the whole world if I   had the power; it is this: I have   heard the Prophet Joseph Smith   say on several occasions when   speaking on the agency of man, and  the liberty and rights of men, that  if he were emperor of the earth,   having control of the whole human   family, he would give every man,   woman and child the right to wor-  ship God according to the dictates of   their own conscience, leaving them   to be responsible alone to their Cre-  ator for their individual acts. These   are my sentiments, and they are the   sentiments of this people to-day,   and have been from the beginning   of the organization of this Church,   and I trust will be to the end of   time. And this we believe to be a   principle emanating from heaven;   and while we accord this right to   our fellow-men, and while we de-  clare it to be a heaven-born right   guaranteed unto all American citi-  zens through the Constitution of   our country, we claim the exercise   of the same right ourselves; and we  claim this right and privilege under   the Constitution under which we   live, and we claim it by the laws of   God to man. And whenever any   people rise up and attempt to make   war upon the rights of men because  of their religion, they go beyond  their right, they transcend their   own powers, whether their power   be derived either from God or man.    J120577You may wish to know why I   make these remarks. I will tell you.   Because God himself grants this   right to every human being upon  the earth irrespective of race or color;   it is part of the divine economy   not to force any man to heaven, not  to coerce the mind but to leave it   free to act for itself. He lays before   His creature man the everlasting   Gospel, the principles of life and sal-  vation, and then leaves him to   choose for himself or to reject for  himself, with the definite under-  standing that he becomes responsi-  ble to Him for the results of his acts.    J120577 - 78It is upon this principle that we  as Latter-day Saints assert our rights   and endeavor to enjoy our privileges.   And we are accorded this right in  accepting the Gospel dispensation in   which we live, and in believing in  the Old and New Testaments, the   records of God's people who lived in  what is called the old world, as well  as in the Book of Mormon, the his-  tory of the ancient inhabitants of   our land, which records are in har-  mony with each other, bearing wit-  ness of the one great Head and of the  Gospel which He taught in Jerusa-  lem and Judea, and which His   Apostles preached after He left   them. It is, in fact, the same Gos-  pel that has been taught to man in every age and dispensation, as there is  but the one Gospel, and that Gos-  pel is adapted to the wants and con-  ditions of all men. It is the Gospel   of Truth, and truth alone can make  us free, free from sin and from the   power of the adversary. And this is   the Gospel which we have received,   and which we take the liberty of   preaching to our fellow-men.    J120578 I do not suppose that there has been   any dispensation upon the earth in   which a greater variety of evidence,   or important evidence of the divini-  ty of the latter-day work has been   given than that which is occurring,   and that will continue to occur until   the second coming of the Son of  Man. There is no man upon  the earth who believes in the literal ful-  fillment of prophecy as contained in   the Old and New Testament, but   who must in his heart believe that   the God of heaven will in the latter   days set His hand to perform a great  work and a wonder in the earth; that  He will call forth His Church out of   the wilderness of darkness and es-  tablish it upon the foundation of  Apostles and Prophets with Christ   Jesus as the chief corner stone.   There is no man that believes in the  Revelations of St. John who does  not believe in his heart that in the  last dispensation the angel as seen   and described by John in his vision,   will fly through the midst of heaven   having the everlasting Gospel to   commit to man again upon the   earth, and that this Gospel is to be   preached in plainness and power to  every nation, kindred, tongue and   people upon the whole earth. [##Revelation 14:6##] There   is no man that believes in the literal   fulfilment of the revelations of God   through the Prophets who does not   believe that the Lord will in the   latter days gather a people together  out of every nation under heaven;   and that He will also gather the dis-  persed of Judah—the Jews—that   have been trodden under the feet of   the Gentiles for the last 1,800 years   for shedding the blood of the Mes-  siah.    J120578 - 79 I wish to bear my testimony to all   men within the sound of my voice  and those to whom my words shall   come, that we are living in that dis-  pensation of God to man that every   Prophet and Apostle that has ever   breathed the breath of life has   pointed to. I bear my testimony   that God, in fulfilment of the Rev-  elations of St. John, has sent the   heavenly messenger to communicate  to man the everlasting Gospel. And   why did the Lord reveal to John  that this would be done? Because   the "falling away" spoken of by   Paul had already commenced; be-  cause John in his exiled condition   sensed keenly that the Church   would be overcome and driven from  the earth, and by way of encourage-  ment to him and information to all   who would believe his word, the   Lord showed him what should take   place in the future. [##2 Thessalonians 2:3##] The Jews had   rejected the Messiah, they had cru-  cified the Lord of life and glory and   they had also persecuted and taken  the life of the Apostles and others   who were left to represent His cause;  and John only was left, and they  tried to take his life; but, in conse-  quence of the promise he had re-  ceived from the Savior prior to His   death, they could not do it: and   hence they exiled him on this   island—called Patmos. [##Revelation 1:9##] When   they rejected the Gospel, they   rejected it in all its power and   glory, its blessings, its gifts and   graces, and also the ordinances of   the Holy Priesthood—Aaronic and   Melchisedek. With regard to Priest-  hood we differ from the Christian   world. We believe there is no man   in heaven or upon earth that ad-  ministers in the ordinances of the   Gospel without the Priesthood, and   we defy the whole world to point to   a single passage of scripture from the  time of father Adam down to Jesus   Christ, showing that any man had   power to administer in any of the  ordinances of the Gospel without the   Priesthood. And we say as Paul  said, in referring to this delegated   power of heaven, that "no man tak-  eth this honor to himself, but he   that is called of God, as was Aaron:"  and he was called of God through  Moses with whom he communicat-  ed. [##Hebrews 5:4##] Therefore men cannot legally   and authoritatively go forth to   preach the Gospel until they are   sent; and men cannot hear the word   and be converted by the same unless  they hear it through the mouth of a   preacher who is sent, and who has   power to administer in the ordi-  nances of the Gospel.    J120579  The Lord has established His Church and His kingdom; and we  have been laboring now fifty years   and upwards in carrying out the in-  structions which he has revealed   unto us in connection with this  work. And as men were formerly,   so we have been commanded to go  forth and call upon men to believe  on the Lord Jesus Christ, and to   repent and be baptised for the re-  mission of their sins; and as they   were authorized, so have we been   authorized to say to all men who   comply with these requirements,  that they shall receive the Holy   Ghost. But say the Christian sects,  these things are no longer necessary,  these outward ordinances are not   now essential to salvation. We be-  lieve they are. In this, of course,   we differ from them, and we have a   perfect right to. Jesus himself went  to John when he was baptizing in  Jordan, and requested baptism of  Him. But Jesus satisfied him by   saying, "Suffer it to be so now; for  thus it becometh us to fulfil all   righteousness. Then he suffered   him." [##Matthew 3:15##]    J120579 - 80Baptism by immersion is one of  the ordinances of the Gospel, and   the law had to be complied with,   and hence Jesns set the example.   But the Jews, as a nation, rejected   Him and His teachings; and the   Apostles were commanded to turn  to the Gentiles. I say Gentiles, we   are all Gentiles in a national capaci-  ty; and the same Gospel that was  taught to the Jews was preached to   the Gentiles. It never varied one iota;  it was sent to them with all its gifts  and graces, its priesthoods, powers  and ordinances without any change  whatever. And Paul in warning  the Gentiles, told them to take heed  and fear lest they fall, through the  same example of unbelief; for if God  spared not the natural branches,   which were the Jews, why should  He spare them who were the wild  branches grafted into the olive tree.  We all understand that the blind-  ness in part which happened to Is-  rael and which, Paul said, should   continue until the fulness of the  Gentiles come in, did befall the  churches which had been built up   by the Apostles, and that the Gos-  pel, with its gifts and graces, its   Prophets and Apostles, has long  since ceased to exist among men.  The Gentiles fell through the same  example of unbelief, until to-day a  man is looked upon as a deceiver   who will rise up and declare himself  a believer in the same Gospel that   Jesus and His Apostles preached.   Paul told the people in his day   that God hath set in the   Church first, Apostles, sec-  ndarily prophets, thirdly, teachers,  after that miracles, then gifts of  healings, helps, governments, diver-  sities of tongues; and they were for  the work of the ministry, for the   edifying of the body of Christ, for   the perfecting of the Saints, until   all come to a perfect man in the   stature of Christ. But the Chtis-  tian world do not believe in these  things; they say they are done away,  as not being needed. We believe  differently, and we have a right to;  we say the Lord has restored the   Gospel as it was preached to the   Jews and the Gentiles by Jesus and  the Apostles, and we know whereof   we speak. Joseph Smith received  the ministration of angels, in fulfil-  ment of the revelations of St. John,  and we know it. He received the  keys of the Holy Priesthood under  the hands of [John the Baptist (NT)|John the Baptist, and  under the hands of Peter, James   and John, and from that day,  through the preaching and admin-  istrations of the Elders of this   Church, God has given a testimony  to hundreds of thousands, of the  truth of this work. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] We believe  this, and we have received the tes-  timony for ourselves of its divinity.    J120580 In looking upon this congregation  assembled in this beautiful building,   I am reminded of the mercy and  goodness of God to us as a people.   On the 24th of July, 1847, I came   here in company with the pioneers.   At that time Utah was a barren de-  sert, there was no mark of the   white man, everything was wild   and barren. To-day you may travel   thousands of miles through this   country, and you find towns and  cities, farms, gardens and or-  chards, temples, and tabernacles and   schoolhouses and large con-  gregations of the people and hosts of  children. And where did all these   people come from, and what prompt-  ed them to come here? You came  from your native lands, from the   different civilized nations, impelled  by the spirit of the gathering which   God has restored in connection with   the Gospel; and you came in fulfil-  ment of the prophecies of Isaiah,   Ezekiel, Jeremiah and David and   others of the Prophets who have  spoken of you. The question that  arises in the minds of persons who  pass through our country and see   the labors of this people is, are we  the dupes of impostors? Was Joseph  Smith a deceiver? There is a way   to the test this, and we have tested  it to our satisfaction. The great   promise made to us when we first   heard the preaching of the Elders of   this Church was, that if we obeyed  certain requirement of the Gospel,  we should receive the Holy Ghost;   and this same promise is extended  to the world of mankind by our El-  ders who are still proclaiming these  glad tidings of great joy. If that   promise had failed we, my brethren   and sisters, would not have been  here to-day; and Utah would doubt-  less be as barren as it was when we  found it in [18]47. There is no question   in our mind, as to the divinity of the  work in which we are engaged. The  Christian world questions it. This,  of course, we cannot help.    J120580 I want to say to the Latter-day  Saints, you are living in an  important and interesting time in  your history, a time when the   principles of the everlasting Gospel   are being brought prominently be-  fore the world, and it is but natural   that they should find their opposite  in misrepresentation and persecu-  tion. Jesus himself, together with  every servant of God of every age,  while endeavoring to bless and save  mankind through teaching correct  principles, made themselves un-  popular and became the subjects of  hatred and persecution. And there  is no doctrine so unpopular to-day  as the principles of life and salva-  tion as God has revealed them; and  there are none so unpopular as those  who believe in and practice the  same. Truth revealed from heaven  for the salvation of mankind al-  ways was unpopular, and always  will be so long as the world exists in   its present state. Men do not want  truth, and therefore they reject it,   and they reject it to-day for the  same reason that men rejected it  formerly, because they love dark-  ness rather than light. If the Lat-  ter-day Saints expect to become   popular in this day and generation,  they will find themselves greatly   mistaken. There is a warfare going  on between truth and error, and   this warfare will continue until He  shall reign, whose right it is to   reign.    J120580 - 81  I also want to say to the Latter-  day Saints, you should exercise  faith in God; you should make your-  selves acquainted with the revela-  tions of God, and with the promises   He has made to His people, fully be-  lieving that all will come to pass as   He has spoken it. And each   man claiming a standing among this  people should do his duty to the   trust committed to our charge. Our  responsibility is great before God   and man. Any people into whose  hands is committed a dispensation  of the Gospel has a great responsi-  bility. And Joseph Smith, Brigham   Young and the Twelve Apostles  would have been under condemna-  tion and would have rendered them-  selves liable to the curse of God if  they had not gone forth into the  world and borne record of this work.  Paul was placed in the same posi-  tion and he sensed it, as is inferred  from these words: "Woe unto me  if I preach not the Gospel." And   this is our position to-day in relation   to the world.    J120581 - 82 I have been with this Church al-  most from its organizaiion, and have   passed through the various scenes  of its early history. I have seen its   rise and progress, and have witness-  ed the power of God manifested in   behalf of this people; and I want to  bear my testimony that  the God of heaven has,  in fulfilment of the prophecies,  set His hand to establish HisChurch  and Kigdom in the earth, which  means no more and no less than  His rule and His government, and   that He will accomplish it, and   there is no power upon the earth or  under the earth that can stay the  progress of Almighty God. But not  notwithstanding this, we expect to   meet with opposition, with the  hatred of the world; this, in fact, is   the legacy of the Latter-day Saints.  Said the Savior to His Apostles, I   have chosen you out of the world,   therefore the world hates you; if you  were of the world, the world would   love you as its own. It hated me,  before it hated you. [##John 15:18-19##] And what are  we going to do? We are going to   trust in God. I have no fears my-  self; I have never had since I heard   the first Gospel sermon by the El-  ders of this Church; for I know that   God lives, and that He has set His  hand to establish His kingdom, and  it will continue to grow and in-  crease until it shall fill the whole   earth. He has called upon  us to proclaim to the whole world  the Gospel of Christ, and we are do-  ing it as fast as circumstances and   wisdom permits; and we promise all  men what the first Elders promised  us, that is, if they yield to the re-  quirements they shall know for  themselves whether this work is of   God or man. Is there, I ask, any   man or set of men dare make such  promises to their fellow men? I   answer, nay; neither could we do   it did we not know that God would  back up the word by imparting the  Holy Ghost. He has done so from   the beginning, and these people can  bear me witness.    J120582 The question may be asked, What  about the course our government  is taking with us? Whatever our  nation does or may do, it will be  held responsible before God; and   every emperor, king and ruler will  be held responsible for the use they  make of the power committed into   their hands. The Lord inspired the  men that framed the Constitution   of our country and has guarded   the nation from its foundation,  in order to prepare free people in  which to establish His kingdom.   Columbus was inspired of God to  persevere as he did to discover this  continent, and thus prepare the way  for a class of people upon whom the  Spirit of the Lord moved to follow;   and when they were oppressed hard  enough they declared themselves in-  dependent, and by the help of God   they established and have maintain-  ed the government which God gave   our forefathers, which is one of the  best constitutional governments   ever known among men. One of its   chief and prominent characteristics   is its guaranty of religious liberty,   permitting every man to worship   God according to the dictates of his  own conscience. This is a sacred   right granted by God himself to all  men; and when the rulers or legis-  lators of any land undertake by en-  actments of law to step between  man and his God, they by that act  become responsible, and must   sooner or later be made to answer  for interfering with a divine law.  This is the light in which we   regard the position of our own  nation in the steps they have   recently taken against us, as a peo-  ple. However, if I were to express   my feelings to Congress and the  leading men of our nation, and to  our enemies and the whole Chris-  tian world, I would say, do not weep   for us—and we are sensible of the  fact that they will not—but rather   weep for yourselves and your chil-  dren, for as sure as the Lord lives   the evils that men seek to bring up-  on us will return in due time upon  their own heads, heaped up, pressed  down and running over. For it is  an eternal law, and a law by which  we are governed, that what mea-  sure we mete, shall be measured   back to us again. Our nation knows  not what awaits it; the Christian   world knows not what awaits it,  and the blind guides that lead the  people cannot tell them, and the   result will be that both the people  and their guides will fall into the  ditch together.    J120582 - 83I will say another thing. The  Lord never did bring judgment up-  on any people of any generation  until He raised up prophets to warn   them of the impending danger. You  may read the history of the great   and ancient cities of Tyre and   Sidon, Ninevah and Babylon and  other cities th[a]t were built to defy   all time and every power but that  of God; but when they were ripened  in iniquity they were cut off, the  Lord raised up men to warn them  and to call upon them to repent;   but when they rejected them the   Lord brought judgment upon them   and they were cut off in their sins.   And so it will be with our nation   and all others, when they shall be  fully warned and they reject the  message that is sent to them. The  heavens are full of judgment, and   as the prophets have said, they will   commence at the House of the Lord   and then go to the nations of the   earth. These things are beginning to   make themselves manifest and the  righteous and pure in heart can see  it.    J120583 I want to see the Latter-day Saints  live their religion, keep their faith   and do their duty, and trust in God.   And if men persecute you for the   sake of your religion, what can you   do? You can go to God, and make   your wants known to Him; and that  is our duty as Latter-day Saints.   And as to our nation, they, as well   as we, are in the hands of God; and  I have nothing to say about them.   God will deal with them; and what  they sow they will reap, and He will  deal with us upon the same princi-  ple. The history of the ancient in-  habitants of this land, as it has come  down to us through the mercy and  goodness of God, fully testifies to   this principle; as long as they did   what was right the blessings of God  followed them, but after they be-  came disobedient and wicked the  hand of God rested upon them. At  times when I reflect upon the great   change that has raken place in our  own land in the morals of the peo-  ple during my time, I feel in my  spirit to mourn and to fear as to the  consequences. I was between 20  and 21 years of age before I heard of   a murder having been committed  in the whole of the New England  States. The first murder that was  committed in our land from this  time I could remember until I gain-  ed my majority, was committed in   New Haven; and I well re  member how the news of it shocked  all New England. What effect has   such news upon the people of the   same region to-day? Throughout  the whole of Christendom to-day,  murder, whoredom, blasphemy, and   their kindred evils and vices are in-  dulged in, and unbelief reigns in   the hearts of men. Men profess to   believe in the Bible; but confront  them with the doctrines and prophe-  cies it contains, and they will at   once either raise a doubt as to their  real meaning or they will openly  deny them; and the few that accept  the literal meaning of God's word,

 DISCOURSE  BY   PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF,  DELIVERED  In the Assembly Hall, Salt Lake City,  Sunday Afternoon, Jan. 6. 1885.    REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.    "Truth is mighty and will prevail"—The  introduction of the principles of eternal  truth—The fulfilment of prophecy in our   own time—The principles of the Gospel  worthy of consideration—The unpopular-  ity of the true Gospel—Peculiar position  of the Latter-day Saints—The kingdom of  God predicted by the prophets—Joseph   Smith—No power can stay the hand of Al-  mighty God—the Gospel of Christ is the   law of salvation—Mormonism unpopular—  Persecution—Polygamy—Treat our fellow men   aright—Commencement of the Mil-  lennium—We are in the hands of God—  Warfare between God and the Devil—  Faith—The secret of the strength of the  Saints—Responsibility of rulers, etc—Re-  sponsibility of the Saints—Conclusion.    THERE is a proverb or saying which I   have heard a good many times in my   life, and which I think bears a great  deal of weight, and that is, "truth is   mighty and will prevail." I think this has   been manifested in every capacity in   which truth has been used whether  applied temporally or spiritually;   whether applied in the capacity   of nations, or families, or in-  dividuals; whether applied to   the world or to the Kingdom of God. I   think that in every age of the world  truth, whether it has been popular or  unpopular, has proved itself, in the  end of its labor, to prevail in all cases.  When Columbus was moved upon by  the Spirit of God to cross the ocean to   find a new continent, his object and de-  sires were unpopular with those by   whom he was surrounded, and it was   only after a good deal of labor that he  gained favor in the eyes of any of the  rulers of the nations whereby to re-  ceive assistance sufficient to carry out   his wishes. But in the end he prevail-  ed. He found a new world, as it were,  which to-day contains a population of   the Anglo-Saxon race numbering fifty  millions of people. The commence-  ment of Columbus' project was cer-  tainly unpopular, but the result has   proved it true. And so in all cases,   whenever men have been inspired to  receive truth or to promulgate any  principle, which would be a benefit to  the human family, they have generally  been unpopular. When Robert Fulton   undertook to demonstrate the power   of steam in a steamboat, the crowd  that gathered to behold the event, did   not gather to see success; they gather-  ed out of ridicule, to see a man fail in   performing a work which they consider-  ed impossible. But when the steam   was applied to the vessel it moved.  The invention was certainly very crude,   but there was truth in it, and it has   prevailed to a great extent; for steam  is the great motive power of all the  machinery in the world, in a great mea-  sure. And so with a Scottish Earl   when he announced that there was a   man going to try and light the City of   Edinburgh with smoke. The man  was looked upon as crazy. But there was   truth in that smoke, and it lit the city,   and it has given light to a good many  other cities since. The principle pre-  vailed, and is now adopted throughout  the world. So with Mr. Morse, the  electrician. He unsuccessfully in the first  instance,—[in 1837-8]—sought aid both  from the American Congress and the  English government to enable him to  carry out his ideas; but ultimately—[in   1843]—he gained assistance from Con-  gress, and his invention of telegraphy  was demonstrated a success, and is   now made use of throughout the civil-  ized world. And so we might go on to   show that in almost every instance  when men have undertaken to intro-  duce new principles—principles of   truth—principles that would benefit the   human family—they have generally  been very unpopular until the truth   was made manifest to the world.    The same thing may be applied to the   introduction of the principles of eter-  nal truth pertaining to the salvation of   the human family in a spiritual point of   view. When our Lord and Savior  Jesus Christ, stepped forth into the   world to occupy the position to which  He had been ordained of God, there  were but few individuals who had faith  in Him, or who were looking for the   coming of the Son of Man in fulfillment  of prophecy. Jesus, all His life, it may  be said, from the manger to the cross,   was very unpopular with the mass of   the human family, more particularly   the inhabitants of Jerusalum. His his-  tory is before the world. He died an  ignominious death upon the cross, and   those of His own Father's house, the  High Priests, and the leading men of   Jerusalem, were all in favor of His   death. [##Matthew 27##] Yet the Savior possessed truth.   He offered truth to the world; He off-  ered life and salvation to the world.   But the principles He taught were un-  popular in His day. He gathered   around Him a few followers; but the  acceptance of His principles cost them  their lives, as it did the life of the   Savior Himself. I do not know of   a man—except it was John the Revelator  —who escaped. They all died violent  deaths. They had to seal their testi-  mony with their blood. Some were  crucified; others were sawn asunder,  beheaded, or in some way put to death  for the word of God and the testimony  of Jesus Christ. They were put to   death for their religion. How is it to-  day? What name has been more hon-  ored, or more held up as an ensample to  the world than the name of Jesus   Christ? The Catholic world, the Pro-  testant world, in fact the whole Christ-  ian world are professing to honor the  name of Jesus Christ. The Savior had   truth, but it was not received in His   day and time.    With regard to our own time my   mind is often led to reflect upon it.   Half a century has past and gone be-  fore the eyes of this generation, since   the God of heaven commenced, as in  former ages of the world, the fulfill-  ment of prophecy and revelation con-  tained in the Bible—this good old book   that the Christian world profess to be-  lieve in so much. The Lord has set  His hand to bring to pass some of these   prophecies and principles which He  had foreordained before the world was,   and which He has left on record   through the medium of holy men who  wrote and spoke as they were moved  upon by the Holy Ghost from genera-  tion to generation. Those prophecies  are with us to-day. They are contained   in the Bible, a book that is published   by millions throughout the Christian  world. The Christian world profess to   honor the Bible, and to honor the  prophecies and sayings of Christ and   the Apostles. But do they believe in   the fulfillment of these things? Do  they believe in the fulfillment of these  principles and truths which are to-day   being fulfilled in the eyes of heaven  and earth? No. Those prophecies and   those principles—which the God of   heaven has set His hand to carry out—  are as unpopular to-day throughout   the Christian world as they were when   Jesus of Nazareth stood in the flesh   and proclaimed the same to the   Jewish nation. We occupy the same  position that they did in that day and   generation with regard to these truths.  Now, as I have said, truth is mighty.   It always has prevailed in every age of   the world. It will prevail in this dis-  pensation as it has done in others.   The God of Israel will no more fail to-  day to carry out the principles which  He has stretched forth His hand to es-  tablish than he did in the days of eith-  er Adam, Enoch, Noah, or Jesus, or in  the days of any other dispensation.    The principles to which I allude—the  principles of the Gospel—are we  worthy the attention and comprehen-  sion of at least the Latter-day Saints,   and it would be well for the Christian  world to take them into consideration  also; for if truth is going to prevail in   the earth it certainly will involve the  destiny of this whole generation, Jew  and Gentile, high and low, rich and   poor, Zion and Babylon. It will in-  volve the destiny of the whole world—  of the fourteen hundred millions of   people who breathe the breath of life   in it. And I bear record and testimony  as a servant of God, that the God of   heaven has set His hand to carry out   those great and eternal principles   which He decreed before the world was   made and which He has left on record  through the mouths of His prophets to   be fulfilled in the last dispensation and   fullness of times. Are those principles   popular to-day? They are not? Why  not? Because the world is not govern-  ed by the spirit of inspiration; because   its people do not seek the Lord; be-  cause they do not honor His name; but  they are governed and controlled by  other principles. But the Lord will   rule over His own Kingdom, notwith-  standing the Devil has great dominion   to-day as he has had in almost every   age of the world. The inhabitants of  the earth have their agency. They   must use that agency according to the  desires of their own hearts whether   they be for good, or whether they be  for evil. But the day is at hand when   the Lord will show the children of this   generation that there is a God in Israel,   as He has done in other dispensations   when He has reigned. In all the his-  tory of the dealings of God with man   this one principle, sooner or later, has  manifested itself: that virtue exalteth  a nation, while sin is a reproach to any  people. You will see that this has   been manifested in the history of  all nations under heaven—in their rise   and progress and prosperity, and in   their fall and decline and in their final  overthrow and destruction. You will  find in every instance that sin, error,  darkness, falsehood, wrong-doing  have laid the foundation of the over-  throw of every nation and city under   heaven from the foundation of the   world until the present time. What   men sow they will reap, and what  measure they measure to others will be  measured unto them.    To-day we occupy a peculiar position   as a people—as Latter-day Saints here   in these mountains. Here is a people  growing up in the earth who are organ-  ized into a Church, called the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.   How did the organization of that  Church come about? Why, the God of   heaven has proclaimed through His   prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and  others, whose writings are contained   within the lids of the Bible, that in the   latter days He would set His hand to  call forth His Church out of the wild-  erness and out of darkness and error,   and establish it upon the foundation of  truth, Christ Jesus being the chief cor-  ner stone. The God of heaven also   proclaimed through Daniel, 4,000 years   ago, that in the latter days He would  set up a kingdom which should never  be destroyed; and the kingdom should   not be left to other people, but it  should break in pieces and consume all  these kingdoms, and it should stand  forever. That prophet also declared  that a little stone should be cut out of   the mountain without hands; that the  stone should become a great mountain  and fill the whole earth; and that it   should break in pieces all other king-  doms. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] Was that Prophet inspired by  the Spirit and power of God? I say in   the name of Israel's God he was, and   so was Isaiah when he spoke of the   gathering of the people unto the   mountains of Israel to establish the   Zion of God in its beauty, strength,   power and glory. [##Isaiah 2:2-3##] The God of heaven also   inspired a prophet as he stood upon   the Isle of Patmos—John the Revelator  —and in connection with the great   events of the last dispensation and full-  ness of times he saw, in vision, an   "angel fly in the midst of heaven, hav-  ing the everlasting Gospel to preach  unto them that dwell on the earth, and  to every nation, and kindred, and ton-  gue and people, saying with a loud  voice, fear God and give glory to Him;  for the hour of His judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6##]  Now I want this congregation; I want   the world; I want the Christian world;   I want the priests of the day who cry   aloud for the blood of innocence to be  shed to carry out their desires—I want  these priests and all who are laboring   to overthrow "Mormonism" to care-  fully inquire, whether those prophets  were inspired of God. And if they   were inspired of God, whether it is   right for them to make war against the   work of God in the earth? Whether it  would not be better to let these things  alone—to leave them in the hands of  the Lord and allow Him to govern and   control as He sees fit? And if these  men were inspired of the Lord and  made those proclamations—with thou-  sands of others in the Bible and in the  revelations of God—the question is,   whether this warfare against God and   against His work is going to prevail?   The wicked will have no such   power; for the Lord has set His  hand to fulfill these things which have  been predicted by His Prophets—to es-  tablish His Church and Kingdom and  Zion upon the earth. He has   called Prophets, and they were   inspired of God. Joseph   Smith was a Prophet of God. He was  a man raised up by the power of God.   He received the testimony of the Gos-  pel of Jesus Christ by visions and rev-  elation as did John the Revelator.   Angels appeared unto him and taught  him the ways of life. Those men who   held the Priesthood—who were put to   death in the flesh for the word of God  and the testimony of Jesus Christ—vis-  ited Joseph Smith. John the Baptist   conferred upon him the Aaronic Priest-  hood; Peter, James and John, the   Apostleship and Melchisedek Priest-  hood; and all the Prophets who held   any keys and powers belonging to the  Gospel, these also visited Joseph Smith,  and conferred upon him those keys and  powers and authority to administer  them on the earth. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:8-12##] These are eternal  truths, as the God of heaven lives, and  they will prevail whether men believe  them or not, or whether the wicked   war against them or not. These truths   belong to God Himself. He is the au-  thor of them. He has given forth cer-  tain decrees, and they will have their  fulfillment in the earth.    Now, as far as the Latter-day Saints   are concerned, I will say to my breth-  ren and sisters we ought to contem-  plate these principles. There is  no power organized beneath the hea-  vens that can stay the hand of Almighty   God. He has set His hand to carry out   His purposes. The world hate this  people, because the Lord has called   them forth out of the world, the same   as He called His disciples of old. This  is the position we occupy to-day as His   people. Though our numbers are   small, yet "a little one shall become a   thousand, and a small one a [s]trong na-  tion:" and the Lord will hasten it in   His time. [##Isaiah 60:22##] A little one has already be-  come more than a thousand, or a hun-  dred thousand, and in spite of all op-  position this small one will become a   great nation, and God will hasten it in   His time, because God is our friend.   Now, these are truths. They have em-  anated from God Himself.    The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the law   of salvation. No man can be saved   without it. The Gospel is the power  of God unto salvation to every one  that believeth—to Jew or Greek, Cath-  olic, Methodist, Baptist, or any other   sect or party on the face of the earth.    We, as Latter-day Saints, are called  upon to build up Zion. We have been  gathered to be instructed by inspiration  and through the medium of the Holy   Priesthood in the principles of eternal   truth. This is our condition to-day.   Fifty-three years have passed since  this work commenced. Joseph Smith   dwelt in the flesh some fourteen years  after he organized this Church. He  holds the keys of this dispensation on   both sides of the veil, and will hold  them forever. God ordained him to   perform a certain work. He performed  it. He stayed on the earth until his work   was finished. All the keys, powers  and principles which God gave unto  him he left with his brethren; although   whatsoever he left with his brethren  did not take from him; for as Jesus  says in a revelation given in regard to   the Priesthood:    "Whoso is faithful unto the obtaining  these two Priesthoods of which I have   spoken, and the magnifying their call-  ing, are sanctified by the Spirit unto   the renewing of their bodies;    "And he that receiveth my Father,  receiveth my Father's Kingdom; there-  fore all that my Father hath shall be   given unto him;    "And this is according to the oath  and the covenant which belongeth to   the Priesthood;    "But whoso breaketh this covenant,   after he hath received it, and altogeth-  er turneth therefrom, shall not have  forgiveness of sins in this world nor   the world to come."—Doc. and Cov.,  ##Doctrine and Covenants 84:33-41|Sec. 84.##    Thus, although the Lord bestows up-  on His servants the same powers and  blessings that He Himself holds, it   does not take away these powers and   blessings from The Father. The Father   possesses all He had before. The Son   possesses all that he hath had given   unto him. So do the sons of the liv-  ing God. When a man bestows those   gifts and blessings and powers upon  others, he does not lose them himself.  The Lord raised up Joseph Smith. He   organized this Church. It has been   organized for 54 years next April. And   what has been the consequence? Have  we had opposition? Yes. Have we had   persecution? Yes. Is not the de-  sire of a great many millions of people  for our overthrow? Yes; and a great   many wish us put to death. Some men  go so far as to be willing to slay, utter-  ly, men, women and children, because   they believe in what is termed "Mor-  monism," but which is really the Gos-  pel of Jesus Christ. These things are   proclaimed to the world to-day. What  is the matter? Mormonism is unpop-  ular. Why is it unpopular? "Be-  cause," say the priests of the day, "it   interferes with our rights. We preach   for hire and divine for money, and if the   Mormons were to prevail in the earth,   we should lose our business, and we   cannot endure it." "Why," says the  world, "you profess to believe in   polygamy, and that is why you are per-  secuted." No, you are mistaken about  that. The worst persecution this   Church ever endured was before polyg-  amy was revealed to the Church. We   have had more prosperity since we car-  ried out that law, and endeavored to   fulfill it according to the command of   God, than we ever had as a people be-  fore. And here is the principle with  me—I speak as an individual; I speak   for myself. If this work is of God; if   the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as revealed   to Joseph Smith, is true, then God will   take care of it; if the patriarchal law   of marriage comes from the God of Is-  rel, He will take care of it; He   will protect and defend it, and  He will uphold the people that   carry it out. I say this is in the   name of Israel's God. And if it is not  of God, who wants it? I don't, neither   do this people. I speak of this prin-  ciple because I want my brethren and  sisters to understand the views I have   upon it.    I know we are engaged in the work  of the Lord. I know this is His Church.  He has organized it with Prophets and  Apostles in fulfillment of predictions  made thousands of years ago. This is  a work which was ordained before   the world was. The Lord Almighty  never created a world like this and  peopled it for 6,000 years as He has  done without having some motive in  view. That motive was, that we might   come here and exercise our agency.   The probation we are called upon to   pass through, is intended to elevate us  so that we can dwell in the presence   of God our Father. And that eternal  variety of character which existed in  the heavens among the spirits—from  God upon His throne down to Lucifer  the son of the morning—exists here  upon the earth. That variety will re-  main upon the earth in the creations  of God, and for what I know, through-  out the endless ages of eternity. Men   will occupy different glories and po-  sitions according to their lives—ac-  cording to the law they keep in the   flesh.    But I want the Latter-day Saints to  understand their position. Our trust   is in God. With regard to men, it is   our duty to treat our fellow men  aright; to leave them in the hands of   God if they persecute us. The Lord   has a controversy with this generation.   This Bible, the Old and New Testa-  ment, contains a vast amount of, I will   say, tremendous revelations, tremen-  dous events, which hang over the heads   of the people of this dispensation. Are  these events going to fall unfulfilled?  No; no more than they did in the days   of the fall of Babylon, of Ninevah, of  Jerusalem, and of other cities in the   nations of the earth. When the inhab-  itants of Jerusalem became ripe in   iniquity; though Jerusalem was the  royal city, in which was the Urim and  Thummim, and in which sacrifices  were made unto the Lord, yet the city   was laid low, and the Jews have been  trampled under the feet of the Gen-  tiles for I,800 years. We are living at   the commencement of the Millennium,   and near the close of the 6000th year of  the world's history. Tremendous   events await this generation. You   can read an account of them  in the revelations of St. John;   the opening of the seals; the  blowing of the trumpets; the pouring  out of the plagues; the judgments of   God which will overtake the wicked   when Great Babylon comes in remem-  drance before God, and when the  sword that is bathed in heaven shall  fall on Idumea, or the world who shall   be able to abide these things? Here  we are living in the midst of these   tremendous events.    We are in the hands of God; our na-  tion is, and so are the nations of the   earth; and when they undertake   to overthrow the Kingdom of God,   which is decreed shall be estab-  lished, they have somebody to fight  against besides Joseph Smith, Brigham   Young, or John Taylor, or any other of   the leaders of the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints. This war-  fare is between God and the devil, be-  tween light and darkness, truth and er-  ror, between the heavens and the earth;   and that God who has supported His   work from the creation of the world,   is bound to do it unto the end. Where   have you ever read that the Kingdom  of God would be overthrown in the  last days? You cannot find it any-  where on the pages of the records of  divine truth. No; the revelations of   God will be fulfilled. And we must   exercise faith in that direction.   As the ancients had faith; as the world  was created by faith; as Noah built an  ark and preached the Gospel of repen-  tance for 120 years by faith; as Abra-  ham went out not knowing where he   was going by faith; as the ancients  performed many mighty works, such as  the subduing of cities and kingdoms   by faith; therefore I say to the Latter-  day Saints, you are required by the   God of Israel, your Heavenly Father,   by his Son Jesus Christ, by the holy  angels, and by every principle of eter-  nal truth to exercise faith in the revel-  ations of God, for they will be fulfilled   as the Lord lives. [##Hebrews 11:7-8##] God is with this  people. But we are required to heark-  en to his voice, obey his command-  ments, and humble ourselves before   Him. And I thank the Lord that I   have lived to see the time when I be-  lieve there is a great improvement  among the Latter-day Saints. I be-  lieve they are exercising greater faith   in God. And there is a calmness pre-  vailing among the Mormons—so called  —that is a marvel and a wonder to the  world. The world wonder why we are   not excited over the opposition that is   brought to bear upon us by the millions   of people who inhabit this continent,   as well as by the people of the nations  of the earth. The reason of our calm-  ness is—God is our friend, our law-  giver, our deliverer. If the Lord can-  not sustain His work, we certainly  cannot. But He can. He has always   done it, and will do it to the end.  Therefore I say to the Saints, fear not.   Trust in God. Let not your hearts be   faint. Let your prayers ascend to the   ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth day and   night. Ask what you want. When  you do that, the Lord will answer your  prayers, if you ask what is right.   There is where our strength lies. It is  in God. I have no hope in anything  else. But I do look upon the Latter-  day Saints as occupying a most glori-  ous position in this day and age of the   world. This is the first time since God   created the world that he has ever es-  tablished a dispensation to remain on  the earth until the coming of the Son   of Man—to remain in power and   strength and glory, until the Millennium,  until He reigns whose right it is to   reign. Behold what lies before you!   Behold the power of God! Behold the  prosperity of Zion! Behold the bles-  sings which have rested upon your   houses, your lands, your flocks and   herds, your children—the blessings of   the earth as well as of the heavens—in   this mighty barren desert! Then why  should we have any doubts or fears  with regard to the Kingdom of God?   No! As a people we should rise up   in faith and power before God and  make our wants known, and leave our  destiny in His hands. It is there any-  how. It will remain there. And with  regard to our nation, I leave them   in the hands of God; but I would  to God their eyes were open to see and   understand the responsibilities that   rests upon them. I would to God that  the rulers of our land—the President   of the United States, the Congress of  the United States, the Supreme Court  of the United States—would learn the  responsibility the God of heaven will  hold them to in the administration of   those glorious principles laid down in  the Constitution of the government of   this country. The God of heaven will   hold this nation, as well as all other   nations, responsible for the manner in  which these principles are used. If   they misuse them, it will be their loss.   If they trample the Constitution under  foot; if they undertake to deprive any  portion of citizens of the rights the Con-  stitution guarantees unto them, they   will be held responsible, and will have  to pay the bill. When innocent blood  is shed, it costs something; and I would   to God that our nation could under-  stand the blessings they enjoy. There   is no nation on the face of the earth  that has the same liberty that is guar-  anteed to us by the Constitution of our  country.    Have we any warfare with our gov-  ernment? Have we any reproach to  offer them? Not at all. I feel sorry  that this nation should sow seeds  which when ripe will bring destruc-  tion; for I know as God lives that if  this or any other government departs  from the principles of truth, become   ripened in iniquity, forsake the Lord,   forsake the principles of life and liber-  ty, the God of heaven will hold them   responsible. Judgments will come   upon the wicked. When men depart   from the principles of truth and cleave   unto darkness and wickedness, they   reap the whirlwind; they lay the foun-  dation for desolation.    I pray God my heavenly Father, that  His blessing may rest upon us as Lat-  ter-day Saints; that we may compre-  hend and understand our position, our   duties and our responsibilities to God.   When I look, brethren and sisters, up-  on this handful of men and women here  in these mountains of Israel, say 150,-  000, out of the fourteen hundred mil-  lion people that dwell on the earth;   when I realize the responsibility that  God has laid upon the Latter-day   Saints, the responsibility of building   up this great Kingdom of our God, of   proclaiming the principles of eternal   life, light and truth to the world; when   I reflect upon these things I ask my-  self the question—What manner of men  ought we to be? Our numbers are  small compared even with the inhabi-  tants of this nation, not to speak of   the inhabitants of the world; yet, as I  said before I say again, the God of   heaven looks to the Latter-day Saints  to carry on His work.    Then let us be careful. Let us rea-  lize our condition. Let us realize we   are here upon a mission. Let us rea-  lize that we will be held responsible for  the manner in which we fill it. We

 Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec. 2, 1897    President Woodruff:    Dear brother,    I received a letter from the missionary committee date Nov. 29  in which I was asked my feelings in taking a mission to  the Samoan Islands in company with Elder Eugene F.  Morris. Bro. Morris and I were notified of this call on  Nov. 26 by the Ward Bishoprick and we expressed our willingness  to them. As soon as we received the notice we presented ourselves  to bro's. Reynolds & Joseph F. Smith with whome we had a long  talk and all matters considered, we were councelled to decide  on as early a date to leave as possible. The next day we told bro.  Reynolds that we were willing to leave on the earliest date Jan. 3, 1898  and that we would be able to just gather the required sum by close  and careful work, feeling truly greatfull to God our Heavenly Father for  this call we desired to show our love to do good by not delaying matters  in the least but doing all in our power to encourage the blessings  of Him upon our weak minds and efforts, that our whole souls  may be completely filled with the blessings and power of God to do his will  among the dark nations and set a noble example. Although the call  was an awful suprise to us, very young boys, we ever pray to be faithful.    May I ever remain your humble brother,    E. F. Soderborg.

 are of very little account compared  with eternal life. When we die we  must leave the riches of this world  behind. We were born naked and  we will go out of the world in  the same condition. We can-  not take with us houses, gold,   silver, or any of this world's goods.   We will even leave our tabernacle  for somebody to bury. Our spirit  must appear in the presence of God,  and there receive our reward for the   deeds done in the body.    Therefore, I pray God my heaven-  ly Father to enable us to live our re-  ligion, to labor for light and truth  that we may not work in the dark,  to live nearer and nearer the Lord   and be prepared for that which is to  come, and eventually gain eternal   life, is my prayer in the name of   Jesus Christ, Amen.

 and confess Him and acknowledge  Him in all things, do it at the risk  of their reputation, and, some of   them, even of their rights as Ameri-  can citizens. What the result of all   this will be is already written; and   it will come to pass as sure as the   Lord hath spoken it.    J120583 I rejoice in the Gospel of the Son   of God as he has revealed it in this   our day; I rejoice in the organization  of the church and kingdom of God,   and in the revelations of heaven. I   read them with a great deal of inter-  est, for I know they are true; and,   therefore, I look forward with assur-  ance to their fulfilment in the earth.   We have but a little time to spend   on earth even though we live to be   a hundred years of age, and we   have no time to waste. We should   live in such a manner that the Spirit  and blessing of God may attend us;   and then when we cease our labors   here we shall pass hence to continue   them in the same cause of salvation   and redemption, and all will be well   with us. Amen.

 should be willing to sacrifice every-  thing for the upbuilding of the King-  dom of God. Any man who will seek  to save his life and desert the princi-  ples of the Gospel, is not worthy of   eternal life. How many have laid down  their lives since the creation of the   world for the sake of the truth? Je-  sus Himself descended below all   things. He descended, I believe, lower  than any other man will be called to  descend. Are we greater than Jesus?  If we are called upon to-day to lay   down our lives, what of it? Is it not  as well to die for the Gospel's sake as  to die for anything else? A mil-  lion of men, a few years ago,   sacrificed their lives for the honor of   this nation. No matter what we may  be called to pass through. Let us  maintain our integrity to God. Where   is the man whose mind has been lit   up by the inspiration of God to com-  prehend the celestial kingdom, or the  celestial law, or the Gospel of Jesus   Christ, who can bear the idea of pur-  suing a course whereby he will be cut  off from inheriting the blessings for  which he has hoped in the future?   No, I would rather die a thousand   deaths than be deprived of those bles-  sings. We have a long time to live   when we get through here. There is   all eternity before us. It will pay you,  it will pay me—no matter what comes,   no matter what this nation may do to   oppress us—to be true and faithful to   our covenants, to our wives and child-  ren, to our God and to our country; it   will pay us to be faithful to the end.    I pray God that this may be our lot,   that we may be true and faithful unto   death, and inherit eternal life, for Je-  sus' sake.  Amen.
