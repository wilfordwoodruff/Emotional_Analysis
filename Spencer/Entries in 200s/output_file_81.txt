 Great Salt Lake CitySeptember 2nd, 1856.To all whom it may concern,This is to certify thatthe case of Margaret D. Petty, in the case of Robert C. Petty deceased was referred to me by President Brigham Young, to investigate and decide and settle.Therefore I would hereby say that inasmuch asRobert C. Petty did consecrate all that he possessed beforeleaving on his mission, and whereas Margaret Petty is hislegal wife for time and Eternity, and has seven children tosupport; and whereas Mary Adelia Northrop Petty is a proxy case, and has left the fort and gone to her Father's homeand taken with her three head of cattle, it is my decisionand council that the 10 acres of land, cattle, sheep, or any other consecrated property which now remains, should not be sold for the support of Mary Adelia Northrop Petty, butthat Margaret D. Petty have the stewardship of whatremains for the support of herself and children.W. Woodruff

I will beginby saying your family are well, though I presume SisterBenson writes you by mail. I paid a visit to Tooeleand Rush Vallies a week ago on Saturday and Sunday. I find the city of E. T. look sorrowful. Brother Maughnand some others are going to leave, probably for CacheValley; their crop is mostly destroyed by the Salt, worms &cI went with Elders J. C. Little, J. W. Cummings and CV. Spencer; we called upon Bro Rowberry—got a goodsupper—looked over the saw and grist mills, findgood work in the flouring mills. He thinks he willstart in six weeks. He went with us to Tooele City—spent the night; started early next morning for RushValley; when we got into it we saw a great smoke, thoughtit was the smoke of Johnson's settlement, but found it to be the old barracks on fire and burnt down; it hadbeen burning 24 hours or so: we hunted two hours, andfound Johnson & Co in six shanties near the mountains,each cabin 30 rods apart in the best Indian's hole youever saw; two Indians could have scalped the wholesettlement and not alarmed any one until they felt an arrow, for they were surrounded in the brush and cedars

 much farther we do not know. When they light upon the earth they eatup every green thing as they go, leaving but little grass or herbage of anykind. We made a rough estimate of the amount that lay dead upon theshore of the Great Salt Lake last fall, having been washed ashore by the waves,as they dropped into the salt water, and we made over one million ^& a half^ ofbushels, at one time thoroughly salted through; they formed a completebelt around the whole Salt Lake shore, (the circumference of which isabout 300 miles) several rods wide, and varying from six to eighteen inchesdeep. When they visit us in large bodies in the fall they deposit theireggs in the earth, and early the following spring they hatch out, and theearth is black with them. They eat up the wheat before they can fly, andleave the earth as bare as a turnpike road. We are much troubled this season with the (so called) large tobacco worm upon the potatoe tops, anda cut worm at the roots, which are doing much damage to that crop; alsowith a worm about an inch long upon the ears of corn; they begin at thetop end and eat the corn down the cob; this worm is annually with us,but worse than usual this season; the green measuring worms are destroyingour cabbages and turnips very bad this season. We are now in the midstof our wheat harvest, and shall have a fair crop; but the drouth has destroye[d]a great quantity of crops of all kinds, as nearly all lands have to beirrigated in this county in order to secure a crop. I will endeavorto put up a specimen of the insects of this Territory as far as I can,and forward them to your address the earliest opportunity. I shall takepleasure in corresponding with you, and should be pleased to obtainany reports containing information upon this subject. We have formedUniversal, Scientific, Agricultural, Pomological, and HorticulturalSocieties in this city and territory, and shall feel thankful for any information which will assist us in obtaining healthy orchards of fruit, good fields of grain and vegetables, and the newest mode of destroying 
 Historian's Office, G. S. L. City August 30th 1856Hon. Geo. A. Smith, Dear SirAmong the strange events of the 19th century, the Eastern Mail arrived at 6½ o'clock P.M.of the 28th inst, bringing your letter of July 15th, also yourjoint letters to Prest. Young, from Washington, in connexion with many other letters, scraps, papers &c. As soon as we obtained them we went up to the President's Office and staidtill 1/2 past 10 o'clock; they show us the dark and gloomy state of the political Horizon, Health of the nation, and friend-ship for Utah &c., but we have all this consolation ofknowing that there is a God who will guide the Stormunto the End, and give every man and nation their just due—for which we feel thankful; we can see the word of God and prophecies of Joseph, Brigham and other prophets, ancient and modern, fast fulfilling upon the Earth, espe-cially in the United States. It is all right, the storm willsoon burst upon the nations, and no power will stay it. I would far rather be in the place of Utah and receive her reward than to have to meet the comingevents and have the rewards of the other States and people.You are remembered by us continually; we feel it our duty according to the Bible to pray for both friendsand enemies.You will perhaps learn before this reaches you, that

Carter,Dear Sir,The Eastern Mail came in on the evening of the 28th, which is much earlier than usual; it brought me your favor of July 9th, containing the reciept of the money paid by the Hon J. M. Bernhisel. We sent a long family letter to Father Carter by the same mail,also to Shuah and Freedom. We hear nothing said about either letters; we do not know whether they were received or not. I have written to you almost every mail for the last three years, and I have received but few letters from you during the last year, and it seems you do not get near all of mine.We learn by the Mail from our Delegates at Washington that the political Horison, Health of the Nation and friendship for Utah is very dark and gloomy, but it is all right with me, there is a God that will guide the storm unto the end, and will pay every man and nation their just due; and I feel thankful for this, I would rather be in the position of Utah and receive her reward than to be in the position and receive the reward of many others. I do not ask our friends in the States to mourn for us, or pity our condition, but let them mourn and weep for them-selves and prepare for that which is to come. The United

BernhiselDear Sir,Your letter of April 7th has come to hand after taking a fishing tour down theWeber River for six weeks; the letter bag that was lost orflung into the Weber River was found by an Indian, andit was brought to this City.Neither your family nor myself received and thing from the Mill, or bro Houtz—we are both out offlour—I furnished Mrs Bernhisel with flour as long asI had it. I am now cutting my wheat—may be some300 bushels: as soon as I can get it thrashed I will supplyher what the Mill does not, but it seems to be a pinchingtime at present. Sister Bernhisel has laid the matterbefore President Young, and informed him that Bro Houtzdoes not furnish him with anything, so she says, andtold him that if he does not do his duty in the matterhe will attend to his case. Mr Houtz takes a strangecourse in relation to your business.Sister Bernhisel is well—she was at my houseto day.We are in the midst of harvest: there will bea great deal of wheat cut this season in the Territory; butit will require a great deal of care to save it all, or weshall be worse distressed before another harvest than we 
 Historian's OfficeGreat Salt Lake CityAugust 30th 1856Hon J. M. BernhiselDear Sir,Our wheat harvest is in, andwe begin to have bread again. Bro. Houtz has beganto bring flour again to your family, and also some tome, (224 lbs) but as long as he could sell it at a high price,he was careful not to let either of us have any. I have notseen him of late. Money is getting very scarce in this Territory, there is but little in circulation. Your thrashingmachine is in operation; I expect to employ it in abouta week to thrash 3 or 400 bushels of wheat. Your familyare all well. I have had your wood cut up of late, andyour oxen have began to draw some (2 loads) I hope theywill continue.It is a general time of health with us in thisTerritory. I think the wheat has come in quite goodthroughout most of the Territory; corn looks tolerablywell; potatoes appear quite a light crop. I have cutboth the samples of wheat and corn you sent me from thePatent office: the wheat got ripe in 90 days, it is theCalifornia Bearded Wheat, a little Taos in it got ripe in85 days; the Bearded Wheat is not near as profitable asthe Taos a Club. The heads are short, and it yields one third less to the acre, and not as good to handle.

 Great Salt Lake CitySeptember 2nd 1856.To Elder  McGee Harris, President of Fort HerrimanThis is to inform you that Sister MargaretPetty called to see President Young upon the subject of settlingher estate. President Young has requested me to hear her case and settle it. I have heard her testimony upon the subject, but have not heard the testimony of Mary Adelia,not having the opportunity of seeing her. From the informa[t]ionwhich I have obtained upon the subject, my decision and council would be as follows:That whereas Elder Robert C. Petty did consecratehis land, cattle, and all that he possessed to the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints before he started on his Mission; and inasmuch as Margareth Petty has sevenchildren to support, and is his legal and lawful wife, for time and eternity; and inasmuch as there is but 10 acres of landunder improvement, and whereas Mary Adelia is a proxy casefor time, and has left and gone home to her friends, and takenthree head of cattle with her.In consideration of these things my council would be that there be no land, or cattle, or any thing else that was consecratedsold for the benefit of Mary Adelia Northrop, more than what shehas obtained, but that Mrs Margaret Petty have the  stewardshipof what remains for the support of herself and children.W.

We heard but little from our handcart emigration,or any of the back Companies. Philemon C. Merrill and company arrived on the 16th inst; as far as we couldlearn all well. I had an interview with Dr J. Clintonwho was well and in good spirits.The weather has continued dry since we lastwrote. Our wheat harvest is gathered and proved tobe a much better crop than we could have expected, consi-dering the drouth; the heads were well filled even wherethe wheat was so short that it had to be pulled, whichhas been the case with many acres this season. Our corncrop looks quite well. The potatoe crop is nearly a failure,they mostly run to vines. Beets and garden vegetableslook well. This season is not our peach bearing year, 
 those destructive insects.Yours respectfully,W. WoodruffMy address is Wilford Woodruff,Historian's Office,Great Salt Lake City,U.T. 
 Historians officeG. S. L. city 30 Augt. 1856Ed. of the LuminaryDear Sir,Since writing to you last month the weather hascontinued dry and favorable for harvesting. The Wheat in many instanceshas filled out in the ear; much better that possibly could be expected, thestalks in many fields averaging over 1 foot in height; potatoes in the cityare almost an entire failure, tho' in the Settlements and on the farm-ing lands there will be a moderate crop. Beets are doing well so faras we have heard; altogether we shall reap a much more abundantharvest than the drouth could have allowed us to anticipate.Many bushels of currants have been raised in the city thisseason, and as I was the chairman of the awarding committee on Fruit appointed by the Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society,I had the opportunity of seeing many beautiful specimens, consideringthat the currants have generally been brought wild from the kanyons, and very few as yet been raised from the seed. We consider currants very well adapted for our climate. A few ripe apricots and plumshave also been exhibited. Several beds of strawberries have yielded abundantly.Prof. Carrington had a seedling peach tree which bore a few peaches this seasonwhich were ripe on the 23rd. curt. He has a very fine bearing peach or-chard. We are budding extensively from several of the best varieties ofapples and peaches which have been brought from the States. I will haveabout 400 buds put in this season in my own orchard of apples, peaches,apricots, plums & almonds. I will have a few good apples this seasonalso a few bunches of Grapes. It is the first season that my orchardhas commenced bearing. Prest. Youngs orchard is bearing well thisseason and I would judge his young vineyard would produce more thana ton of grapes. 
 A company returned from Carson Valley last evening—ratherdull times there; they report Murray and Reddin (I think brotherto Jack Reddin) killed by the Indians. I think Murray was the one tried last winter for Murder.Our wheat crops have come in quite well; corn looks middlingwell; Potatoes have mostly run to tops this season—I think the crop will be light.Brother Isaac Chase is quite sick with a fever, and brotherThurston has been very sick of late with rheumatism, but is getting better.As concerning Fruit I would say President Youngwill have, I think, 20, or 30.00 lbs of Grapes; some apple treeshang full, and a middling crop of peaches. I have somevery large fine seedling apples, 1/2 bushel of plums, a fair cropof peaches &c. Your trees are growing very well, I have trimmed them some. We have about 20 different kinds of apples from the States now growing in this Valley, which we are spreading as fast as we can.I have sent a list of fruit to the Hon J. M. Bernhiselto procure for us at the Linnaean Gardens and Nursery ofWm. R. Prince & Co., at Flushing near New York—about 50kinds of fruit for the benefit of our Territory.Your family are all well. Sister Smith was at a Melon party at my house on Wednesday evening, and enjoyed herself well. Geo. A is diligently at work in thePrinting Office: I wish thousands of the boys of this Territory were following the same example by learning a trade of some kind. 
 States do not know what awaits them—that dismal, awful trumendous storm which has been gathering for years will assuredly burst, and fall upon the people of the United States with a force that will carry death, sorrow and woe to many thousands of her inhabitants, and it is nigh at their doors as true as their is a God in Israel—whether Utah lives or dies.We are, as a general thing in good health and spirits: Our wheat and other crops are coming in middling good.Mrs Foss and family are well.

It is expected that he will visit the settlements againsoon. Arropene, Ammon and others were with us on Sundayall well with them. Our settlement is broken up at SalmonRiver by the grasshoppers, who have eaten up every green thingThey will probably go there again when they make a raiseof more provisionsThe California Mail came in on the 29th inst. TheEastern Mail came in the last night, and brought me your letterof June 7th, with your bills of lading, and goods, and letterof instructions &c, all of, which I will attend to, to the best of my ability.Bro Houtz did not give me any of the book money;He brought me a bill of settlement, or balance sheet of the Mill;charged you some $80 for wall tax—was some $70 due onthe balance. I intend to see brother Houtz and tell himthat he must do his duty towards you in this matter morehonestly and promptly, or I shall have to make a churchmatter of it, if I do not take a course of law with him. Ishall send to Mr Scovil, at Provo, for a copy of the agreementnext mail.

Bernhisel, I wish you would do me a favorwhich will be a benefit to the whole community, and it isthis; you have forwarded me from R. Prince and Co's Cata-logue of fruit trees, and I believe they have as good a selectionas there is in the United States, and I wish to obtainsome cuttings from their Nursery. We obtained a fewvarieties of choice apples from the States last spring, whichwere grafted, and we are now butdding from them, but wewant other varieties, but I cannot send silver or gold bymail with safety, and we have no bills. I forward with this a list of what I wish to obtain: we have wanted 22 kindsof apples, 6 kinds of pears, 8 of plums, 7 of cherries, 2 ofQuinces, 2 of Currants, 1 of Gooseberry, 1 Blackberry, and2 of Grapes. I see from his advertisement that he willforward grafts for about $1 per 100,—25 cents per parcel, or50 cents per doz, but I do not want more than two or threecuttings of each kind, and if we have two of each kindthat would take $1, and there were three it would be$1 50/100; but if they charge as much for one or two, as theywould for three of each, it would be well to get three of akind.

 Great Salt Lake City, July 31st 1856To the Editor of the Luminary,Dear Sir,Another month of hard times has rolled into eternity, andI again renew my correspondence with you. The drouth of the summer has been mercifully relieved by 3 or 4 pleasant thunder showers during the past week, which has proved a blessing to the crops, for the corn nowlooks a little more pleasant, the shriveled leaves uncurling themselves finely, and the farmers feel a little more cheerful than they did afortnight ago.The prospects are decidedly gloomy, many fields of wheat are not a foot high, and the tobacco worm and caterpillar have swept manyfields of potatoes in various locations. The corn in many places is infested with a grub which destroys the grain while in its milkytender condition, and to crown the entire calamities, Jack Frost cameon the 23rd June and nipt the corn and potatoes; and then as ifto make sure work he came again on the nights of July 16th & 17th, and left his marks more plain on the corn and potatoes, the squash, and cane grass.About 3 weeks since G. S. L. City was visited by a flight of grasshopperswhich fortunately did not remain any considerable length of time.Although the above is somewhat a gloomy prospect, still we are[c]heered by the harvesters cutting down their wheat, where it is sufficientlyripe. In addition to the hand labor, we have in the territory two of McCormick's reapers which give entire satisfaction to some, whilst othersdo not like them much. The people are most anxious to secure wheat enough for themselves; and those who have a portion above their necessities, 
 Historian's officeG. S. L. City Augt. 30, 1856Ed. of the Mormon,Dear Sir,The Eastern mail arrived on the evening of the 28th, inst., bringing Mormons up to the 12th July—considerable news from our Washington delegation, and the Eastern country.The weather continues dry and favorable for harvesting. Our wheat crops have proved much better than we had estimated on ac-count of the drouth, and the scanty supply of water from the creeks. Potatoes in the city on the higher land are genererally a failure; on the lower and Farming lands, there are moderate crops; having mostly grown to tops. Corn crops in many places look well. We probably will reap a much larger amount of grain than possibly could have been calculated upon during the dry summer. The wheat has filled remarkably well out in the ear notwithstanding the stalks were so small that in many instances the Farmers have had to pull their grain instead of cutting it.The health of the people during the past season has been remarkably good.During this month Elder Parley P. Pratt and a few bretheren have been appointed on missions to the States. ThomasBullock, Bernard Snow and several others to Europe. They expectto start on or about the 10th of Sep.On the 10th curt. the first division of Elder P. C. Merrill'scoy. came into the city, and since the balance have arrived; being the first company of our emigration this season.The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society hold their first annual Fair in this ciy, commencing on 1st October; at which therewill be an exhibition of stock, agricultural products, Farming and

 expence will be, and have him put them up in a tin boxand solder it tight, and have him send it to you at Wash-ington, or wherever you may reside at the time. I supposethey should be cut in the month of January or February, sothat we can get them by Spring, but I want to write inSeason so that they can be attended to. We have sent forsome before, but the person instead of putting them in a tin box and soldering it up air tight, put them in a woodenbox, and they all spoiled, except those that had been sent in a tin box, which had kept good. I wish when you getthem that you would direct the box to me, and then put oneor two papers in it with directions on each, so that if one getsworn out another may remain, and send it to me: this is bythe request of the Agricultural and Manufacturing Societyit is for the benefit of the whole Territory; whatever the expenseis please let me know, and charge it to me, and I will pay allexpenses. I wish to have each package of cuttings marked sothat I can know what kind of fruit it is when it comes. I shallalso write to Wm R.

I was with the Presidenttill 1/2 past 10 o'clock hearing the Washintgton and other lettersread; your joint letter to President Young shows the darkstate of the political Horizon; all right, there is a God inIsrael who will guide the storm and pay every man andNation their just due; and may God Almighty hasten it ismy prayer; the words of Joseph, Brigham and the prophetsare fulfuilling. 
 Great Salt Lake City, July 31st, 1856To the Editor of the Mormon,Dear Sir,In the midst of the hurry of harvest we devote a shorttime to write you a few items of what is transpiring in this blest Territory.It is well known to all the civilized world that we are located in the valleys of the great American Basin, some portions of the rim rising from eleven to sixteen thousand feet above the level of the sea; therefore we are isolated from "the rest of the mankind," having but little communicationwith the world, for if our friends write to us, it is a risk whether the letterscome to this city or not, and therefore as a general thing we have nobody to write to. The weather for the past month has been excessively dry, with the exception of some three showery days which was a great relief not only to the saints but to vegetation; they gave a renewal of life and vigor to all. The streams are comparatively dry, and we are bound to acknowledge the hand of God in all things; for it is miraculous that there is any wheat at all, fmany fields of it not having grown a foot high, yet the ears being tolerably well filled. The potatoes too are in many places cut down to the earth by an army of caterpillers and tobacco worms; the drouth in other places causes the vines to wilt, and on examination there are no potatoes at the roots.In addition to all these calamities, Jack Frost visited the low lands on the 23rd June, and as though he really thought the people did not believe he could come on the shortest night of the year, he visited many fields of corn, potatoes, and vines on the nights of the 16th & 17th July,and left his icy mark wherever he went, for vegitation wilted under his rude embrace. 
 a few others have been appointed on Missions to the StatesThomas Bullock, Bernard Snow, and some others toEurope. Jonathan Grimshaw has left the Historian's Officeand returned to England upon his own responsibility and businessThe Agricultural & Manufacturing Society hold their Annual fair, on the 1st October, at which there will be anexhibition of Stock, Agricultural products, Farming and Gardening Implements, Manufactures, Ladies Work, Machineryand Fruit. A ploughing match will take place on the Governor's Land near the City, about conference time. There will be premiums awarded for the best of each namedclass; also for the best essays on Agriculture, Horticulture,Pomology and Home Manufactures. We expect the fair willbe extensive as the occasionBro Willes, the Territorial Inspector of Schoolshas returned from a tour to the North, and reports the favorableresults consequent upon the coöperation of the authoritiesin the various settlements; also the establishment of SabbathSchools and the organization of Literary Societies.Among other improvements in the city a new BaptismalFont is now being built near the Endowment House in the Temple Block.Yours Truly,W. Woodruff 
 Historian's Office, G. S. L. CitySept 4th 1856.Editor of the Standard Dear Sir,The Eastern Mail arrivedon the evening of the 28th ult, Bringing letters and papersfrom our delegates in Washington &c, which gave us a generalaccount of the of the state of the political atmosphere, and the generalnews of the day. The California mail arrived on the 1st inst;bringing us the "Standard" up to July 26th, and other papers and letters from our western friends. It is truly a treat to usto hear once a month what is going on in the lower world, East, West, North and South. We truly feel to bid you Godspeed in your noble effort in lifting up and maintaining a "Standard" in the West; and we pray the Lord to raise you up friends and means that you may be sustained in so worthy an undertaking; for having been very freelyrepresented for twenty years, in many parts of the world, we now esteem it a great blessing to have the privilege ofrepresenting ourselves. We men find a slight differencebetween being represented by friends or enemies, especially as the Latter Day Saints.We did not hear by the last mail much from ourhand cart trains. Governor Young has sent out teamswith a large amount of flour, to meet them.It is a general time of health throughout our Territory. 
 President Young is extending his high stone wall around all around his Mansion and garden. President Kimballhas built a fine granary with cobble stones laid in cementand his extending his wall all around his premises.The New Historians Office is progressing finely; the plasterers last night finished their work on it, it will soon be ready for us to go into.I hope we shall hear from you often.We wish to be remembered to you.As Ever, I remainYours truly, W Woodruff 
 will be very careful to store it away. They are also in hopes that the corn and potatoes will yet turn out pretty good, so that all saints who cometo the valleys this fall may be sustained.One blessing has been conferred upon us by some apostates who lefthere for St. Louis this spring, and reported their doleful tales to all theEmigrants who are bound for the gold mines; which caused them to takethe cut off east of Bridger's Fort. By this means the great droves of cattlewhich would otherwise have thronged our streets, and used up all the grass inthe neighborhood of the city and the northern settlements, have passed by.If they had come this way it would of necessity have caused the citizensto have sent their cattle eight miles for feed; we are thankful for even thissmall favor.The 24th July was passed by the Presidency and a select company up atthe head waters of the Big Cottonwood Creek, several thousand feet above the valley; they had a splendid and agreeable time, the particulars of which you will see in the Deseret News of 30th July. Those present were invited ^by Prest Young^ to meet again at 4 p.m of the 23rd July 1857 at the same place, together with such others as he may invite. He expressed himself that it wasthe freest, happiest celebration he has participated in, as no formality hadbeen manifested on the occasion, and every person felt well.You will be sorry to hear that the milk weeds have taken almost universalpossesion of that portion of your farm on the west side of and adjoiningthe State road, and most of the trees that you had caused to be plantedare destroyed by the cattle grazing there breaking them down, or bywagons being driven against them by careless drivers.We are not experiencing such excessive, unbearable hot weather thissummer as yet, although it has been very dry with the exception of threeor four days. The people are generally enjoying good health, and all arein good spirits and cheerful. 
 Gardening implements, Manufactures, Ladies work, Machinery and Fruits.A ploughing match will take place on the Governors lands near thecity about conference time. There will also be premiums awarded forthe best Essays on agriculture, Horticulture, Pomology, and home man-ufactures.A fair on such an extended scale will be a novalty in Utahand elicit from the genius and enterprize of her citizens such specimensand productions, as no doubt will lend greatly to enhance the cause ofagriculture and home manufactures.In the various wards of the city, and throughout the Territoryauxillary societies are being formed, to facilitate the accomplishmentof the objects of the Institution; and to a people so remote andisolated from the commercial world, to does not require much logicto show them, the majority of sustaining themselves by producing andManufacturing what they consume.Several bretheren have left the valley this season, some say theyintend to return when the "times" become better.Br. S. M. Blair and compy. start on monday first for Ruby valleywhere he expects to meet br.

 If such a continued scene of trials were to be poured out upon any other people in any part of the world, they would be entirely discouraged and would vacate their farms; sometimes we hear a sound as of people in the lower world wanting to live inn these upper valleys, but if this people were to vacate them in 1857, there is no other people that would be compelled to live in these mountains for two years; for they would perish either by famine or by killing each other in quarrelling about the water to irrigatetheir fields, so you can proclaim boldly a few naked truths to enlightenthose who are now sitting in Egyptian darkness on the subject of this ex-alted Territory.I have seen Sister Taylor this morning; she and all your family are enjoying good heath and spirits.Yours truly, W.

 mercial basis. The community are fast becoming unableto sustain the merchants in importing such heavy trainsof goods and merchandize, and are thereby becoming obliged to foster our own manufacturers and mechanics, who are abundantly able, if encouraged, to compete with the imported merchandize. It is true we lack staples which are necessary for any peoples prosperity; and until thesame are produced in or near our Territory, in sufficientquantities, we must import more or less; but with the ironworks going ahead, the increasing flocks of sheep, theexcellence of our Flax, and the establishment last seasonof a cotton raising company on the Rio Virgin, and the amount of commodities which exist in inexhaustible quantitiesin our Territory, we will soon have all the facilities withinreach which are desirable, and the people are wakingup to the importance of the subject.The Horticultural Society Meetings and exhibitionsof Fruit, and the success which has been realized byFruit culturists have been the means of creating a generalinterest in behalf of fruit culture in the city, on lots suitablyadapted, although as you are aware, the Presidency, many of the Twelve, and leading citizens have been doing theirutmost since our arrival here, and have very promisingorchards.

 THE DESERET NEWS.  67trouble should be about keeping thecommandments of God that we may bejustified before the Lord as Caleb andJoshua were. [##Numbers 14:6-30##] Our blessings will dependupon our acts; they will be withheld aslong as we are careless about God's com-mands, but as soon as we yield implicitobedience thereto they will be multi-plied on our heads. This we shall find to be true.I desire to see Zion rise, and the Lat-ter-day Saints prospered and blessed. Iwant their prayers day and night forZion, for the Priesthood and the king-dom of God. Pray for the Lord to makebear His arm in carrying out His pro-mises made to Abraham, Isaac andJacob, Joseph, Ephraim and Manassehconcerning their seed in the last dispen-sation. Pray for your enemies; let themhave the benefit of your prayers, theLord knows they shall have the benefitof mine day and night. We are com-manded in His word to pray for ourenemies, and I believe the Latter-daySaints do pray for theirs, and I have morefaith in the prayers of this people beforeGod in getting power to build up Zionand overthrow her enemies than in allthe weapons of war in the world. Iwould not feel so if I had no faith inGod; but the fact is, there is a God inIsrael. He has created the earth andHe rules over it and it is His right so todo, for it is His footstool, and He is com-ing to reign upon it. And everythingthat we do here in attending to the or-dinances of His house prepares the wayfor, and aids in the accomplishment ofthat work. It is now thirty-seven yearssince this church was organized, and all that time it has been slowly progress-ing. The Elders of Israel, the Twelve,Seventies, High Priests and Bishopshave traveled abroad among the nationspreaching the gospel, and every manwho has been baptized, every sin over-come, every city warned, every nationin which the gospel has been preachedhas been so much accomplished in pre-paring for the coming of Christ; everytemple, school-house, village or citythat we build, every acre of ground thatwe dedicate to the Lord, every step wetake, however small it may be, has itsweight in preparing for the coming ofthe Son of man. We are not going tobuild up Zion in a day; though theScriptures say a nation shall be born ina day, nor will the kingdom of God bebuilt in a day; but we must labor everyday as it comes, and so we gain a littleand keep gaining, and the Lord is goingto labor with us. Let us not be dis-couraged but do good as we have op-portunity, and try to overcome our sinsand imperfections, and set not ourhearts on the things of this life so that they may draw us away from the com-mandments of God. Inasmuch as wedo this we will increase in power anddominion, and the kingdom of our Godwill spread itself abroad until the law ofGod shall go from Zion as well as the word of the Lord from Jerusalem, andGod shall dictate among all the child-ren of men. This is our work, and inno greater can we be engaged; it is alabor worthy of God, angels and Saints.Brethren and sisters I do not wish tooccupy any more of your time this morn-ing.  I feel well with regard to the workof God. I rejoice in the Lord, I knowthat God lives and reigns.  I know thisis His people, and that this kingdom isHis kingdom. I know this is a verywicked generation and that the judg-ments of God are at their doors, andunless they speedily repent that theywill suffer a great deal more for theirsins than the Saints have for trying tokeep the commandments of God. Ipray that the Lord will prepare us forthat which awaits us and the world, thatwe may have the favor of God, enjoy theHoly Ghost, and that the spirit of truthmay direct us in all the acts of life, forJesus' sake. Amen. 
 DISCOURSE DELIVERED BYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,IN THETabernacle, Salt Lake City, SundayAfternoon, June 6th, 1880.REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINEI have a desire to be heard in whatI say to this assembly. I know thedifficulties there are in speakinghere. It requires not only attention,but quietude among the people.I feel disposed to read a few versesfrom this good old book the Bible—some of the sayings of Isaiah and Ezekiel. -[The speaker then readfrom the 12th chapter of Ezekiel, from the 21st verse to the end of thechapter.]- I have (the speaker con-tinued) a few reflections upon mymind that I would like to lay before the Latter-day Saints, especially those who bear the holy priesthood.Among the lessons which we arelearning in our day and time is this one truth: that we all of us need the spirit of revelation in order that we may teach mankind of the things of God. I do not believe myself thereever was a man lived in the flesh onthe earth in any day or age of the world, no matter what his position,calling, name, or age might be—I do not believe any man ever had the power to do the work of God, to build up his kingdom, or to edify the souls of men, without inspiration and revelation; for the Lord has never called any man in any age ofthe world to do any of this kind of work, whether to preach the gospel, to prophesy, or to declare the wordof the Lord to the inhabitants of theearth, or to administer in any ordi-annce in any temple or in any ta-bernacle, without the holy priest-hood. There are no ordinances ac-ceptable in the sight of God of any force after death, or in the eternal worlds except those ordinances thatare performed by men bearing theholy priesthood. Our heavenlyFather himself has officiated by this principle in the creation of all worlds, in the redemption of allworlds, and in all the work which he has performed; it hasall been done by the power of theGodhead and the holy priesthood, which is without beginning of daysor end of years. This priesthood has power with the heavens. It has as-sociation with the heavens. Theheavens are connected with this priesthood, let it rest upon the shoul-ders or head of any man, whether it be Jesus Christ, or those fishermen,or the ancient patriarchs or prophets or Joseph Smith, or any other manwho is called of God as was Aaron,by revelation, and prophecy to bearrecord of the name of God in any ageof the world. Therefore, I occupythe same position myself. I know I need the Spirit of God. I know you do. I know any man does who rises on this stand, and attempts to teach the people. You give a manthe inspiration of Almighty God andthe eternal truths of heaven and he can instruct and edify the children of men upon the principles of life and salvation; without this he can-not do it. And in order to presentto my brethren and sisters and friends the subject that I have on my mind, I will just refer a littlefurther to some words of the Lord to the Prophet Ezekiel. -[The speakeragain referred to the Book of Eze-kiel, and quoted from the 9th, 14thand 33rd chapters, all of parts quoted having reference to the dealings of God with the wicked.]- Continuing, Elder Woodruff said: Now, having quoted all these passages of Scrip-ture, I want to say to my brethren the Apostles, the High Priests, the Seventies, the Elders of Israel, who bear the holy priesthood, upon whose shoulders the God of heaven, in thisday and generation has placed theresponsibility of the Melchisedecand Aaronic Priesthood, has placedthe responsibility of this great andlast dispensation and fulness oftimes, has placed the responsibility of the building up of the great kingdomof God which Daniel saw by revela-tion, vision and inspiration in his day and generation as proclaimed by all the prophets and apostles who have written in this book, in thestick of Judah as well as in the stick of Joseph and other revelations giv-en to us through the mouth of theprophets and apostles in our dayand generation—I want to ask inthe face of all this—and I take it home to myself—what position arewe in before high heaven, before God the Father, before his son Jesus Christ, before the heavenly hosts, before all justified spirits made per-fect from the creation of the worldto this day? What condition are we in as the servants of the livingGod, men holding the holy priest-hood into whose hands the God of Israel has given this kingdom. Are we disseminating the mighty flood of revelation and prophecy in theserecords and these books which are now to rest upon the generation as in the days of Noah and Lot. In this respect are we justified in thesight of God, in the sight of heaven,in the sight of angels, and in the sight of men? Can we fold ourarms in peace and cry "all is peacein Zion," when, so far as we havethe power of the priesthood resting upon us, we can see the condition of the world? Can we imagine thatour garments will be clean without lifting our voice before our fellow-men and warning them of the things that are at their doors? No, we cannot. There never was a set of men since God made the worldunder a stronger responsibility to warn this generation, to lift up ourvoices long and loud, day and nightso far as we have the opportunity and declare the words of God unto this generation. We are required to do this. This is our calling. It is ourduty. It is our business. We have had to perform this work for the last 50 years of our lives. When theLord called Joseph Smith to lay thefoundation of this Church he calledhim in fulfilment of many revelationsgiven in other dispensations of men. He was preserved by the hand of God to come forth in the last days, even in the dispensation of the ful-ness of times. He was a prophet ofthe living God. He was a prophet, seer and revelator. The Lord called upon him to do the work for whichhe was ordained before the founda-tion of this world. He did all that was required of him, and he wassurrounded with thousands of menwho were acquainted with his life, and with the spirit and power ofGod which rested upon him, and who sustained him in life and in death. We know he was a prophet of God, and we know he broughtforth the stick of Joseph, the Book of Mormon, which was given untohim by the angel of God. Thischurch and kingdom has been or-ganized by the command of God and by the revelations of heaven. It has continued to grow and in-crease, and has been upheld by theLord Almighty, from its organiza-tion until the present hour. And when I look at this tabernacle and think of the words of the prophet Isaiah, "that the mountain of theLord's house shall be established inthe tops of the mountains;" when I look at these everlasting hills and the land given by promise to fatherJacob and his posterity; when I see this barren desert peopled by 150,000Saints of the living God who havebeen gathered from nearly every na-tion under heaven through the pro-clamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ—what can I say about it? Can I say it is a dream? Can I say it is all a vision? Can I say thatthis work is of man and not of God? Can I say these are revelations andprophecies which belong to someother generation? I tell you no.This is the kingdom of God.  Hereare the Saints of God. These mountains are being filledwith the Latter-day Saints fromevery nation under heaven, and withthese things before me I know thatit is my duty to preach the gospel, to warn Saints and sinners wherever I have the opportnnity.  The Lord told Joseph Smith that he would prove us in all things, whether we would abide in his covenant even unto death, that we might be found worthy. The prophet sealed histestimony with his blood. That tes-timony is in force upon all the world and has been from the day of hisdeath. Not one word of the Lord shall pass away unfulfilled. The un-belief in this generation will make no difference with regard to thebuilding up of the kingdom of God.As it was in the days of Noah so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be. Therefore, I desire to askmy brethren, the Elders of Israel—and I ask myself at the same time—do we understand our position beforethe Lord? Ezekiel has passed away. He is in the spirit world. He has received his resurrected body and stands at the right hand of God withother prophets and apostles wholived in days gone by. They had their day and generation. All thesepatriarchs and prophets and apostleshad a time to prophesy, to preach, tolabor, and to administer in the or-dinances of life and salvation. Now, in this last dispensation, ye Elders of Israel, this work has been put intoyour hands. Therefore, what shall we say, and what shall we do? Arewe acting as watchmen upon thewalls of Zion? If we are, are wejustified in closing our mouths, in closing our ears, or in setting ourhearts upon anything else excepting the building up of the kingdom of God? I do not think we are. In myview our responsibility is very great.We should live our religion. We should practice ourselves what we preach. We should treasure upthe words of life. We should search the records of divine truth. We should seek to compre-hend the day and age in which welive. This is the way I look upon our situation to-day. I do not look upon the revelations recorded inthese books, touching the dispensa-tion of the fulness of times, as some-thing that will pass away unfulfill-ed. We live in a generation whengreat changes are about to take place. We live in a time when darkness covers the whole earth and gross darkness the people. Theworld are a great way from the ruth. Infidelity overwhelms theearth, in fact it is a hard matter to-day to get either priest or people, sect or party, of any name or denom-ination under heaven to believe inthe literal fulfilment of the Bible, as translated in the days of King James, which contains the revela-tions given from the days of Father Adam down to our own time, and which point out to us the signs of heaven and earth indicating thecoming of the Son of Man. We live in the generation itself when Jesus Christ will come in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. We live in the generation when thegospel of Jesus Christ has been re-vealed in its fulness to the Gentiles,and when the gospel of Christ willgo to the house of Israel, to the de-scendants of Lehi in fulfilment of that which is recorded in their rec-ords in the 9th, 10th and 11th chap-ters of the last Book of Nephi. These prophets spake by the power of God and the inspiration of the HolyGhost, and as the Apostle says, "Noprophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation. For the pro-phecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of Godspake as they were moved by theHoly Ghost." I feel therefore to sayto my brethren who bear the holy priesthood, and I say it to myselfand to all—I do not think we have much time to lay downand slumber. We have notime to speculate in trying to get rich, in trying to accumulate gold and silver. What we have got to do is to build up the Kingdom of God. As Apostles, High Priests, Elders, Seventies and the lesserpriesthood, we are bound togetherby this new and everlasting gospeland covenant; we are called to per-form the great and mighty work of building up Zion, of building temples wherein we may labor for the living and the dead, and we should live in that way and manner that we maybe governed and controlled at all times by the Holy Spirit.I know very well how the worldlook at these things. As I said be-fore, the world is far from the Lord.We ourselves are too far from theLord as a people. We ought to draw near to the Lord, and labor toobtain the Holy Spirit, so that whenwe read the revelations of God wemay read them by the same spiritby which they were given. Then wecan understand their purport whengiven to the children of men.The Lord has said by the mouth of the Prophet Isaiah, that he wouldproceed to do a marvellous work and a wonder; and when I look at the rise and progress of this Church, when I behold the great work the Lord has performed, it was a marvel-lous work and a wonder indeed. There never has been, in my view, any generation in which the same amount of prophecies and importantevents have to be fulfilled as in thegeneration in which we live. JosephSmith, an illiterate boy, was raisedup by the power of God. His teach-ers were the angels of heaven. Hewas administered unto by the Son of God. He received the Aaronic priesthood of John the Baptist, who was beheaded for the testimony of Jesus Christ. He received the Apostleship and Melchizedek priest-hood under the hands of Peter, James and John, who were also put to death for the word and testimonyof Jesus Christ. He made use of these ordinances by the command-ment of God. He organized theChurchand kingdom of God; he did that which all the wisdom of the secta-rian world could never have compre-hended. He established the onlychurch on the face of the earth ac-cording to the ancient order of the Church of Jesus Christ, with apos-tles, prophets, teachers, gifts, helps, governments, baptism for the re-mission of sins, the laying on of hands for the reception of the HolyGhost—an organization which has not existed on the earth from the day the ancient apostles were put todeath, and the holy priesthood takenfrom the earth, until the present.This church has continued to rise.It is the only true church upon theface of the whole earth. Its historyis before the world. It has contin-ued to grow and increase from theday it was organized until the pres-ent time. This is the Zion of God. We see an embryo of it in thesevalleys of the mountains, and it is designed by the Most High God to stand on the earth in power and glory and dominion, as the prophets of God saw it in their day and gen-eration. This is the kingdom thatDaniel saw, and it will continue to roll forth until it fills the whole earth. These are eternal truths, whether the world believe or disbe-lieve them, it matters not, the truths cannot be made of non effect.This is certainly a strange work anda wonder. There has been every ex-ertion made to stay it. Armies havebeen sent forth to destroy this peo-ple; but we have been upheld and sustained by the hand of the Lorduntil to-day.And now I desire to bear my testi-mony. I have no fears, my brethren and sisters—and I say the same to our nation, to all kings, queens, emper-ors, presidents and governments ofthis world—I have no fears with re-gard to "Mormonism," and the ulti-mate triumph of the kingdom ofGod; because the Lord Almightyhas said that the nation and king-dom that will not serve him shall perish and be utterly wasted away. If this had not been the Zion of God it would not have stood solong as it has done. This kingdom,however, has not been organized bythe power of man but by the power of God, and whatever God under-takes to do he will carry out. I havetherefore no fear of this kingdom. Itwas ordained to come forth before the world was made; and the Lordnever undertook a dispensation of this kind without due preparation before he commenced. He had ma-terial in the spirit world who would in time be raised up to carry on thiskingdom. I have no fears aboutthis work being accomplished, but I have fears about many of the Lat-ter-day Saints; because if we have the holy priesthood upon our headsand do not live our religion, of all men we are under the greatest con-demnation. We have baptized a great many into this Church and kingdom—not many, certainly, when compared to the twelve hundred million inhabitants of the earth—but a great many have apostatized. What! Latter-day Saints aposta-tize! Yes. I tell you people will apostatize who have received the holy priesthood and Gospel of JesusChrist, if they do not honor God, if they do not keep his com-mandments, obey his laws and humble themselves before the Lord; they are in danger every day of theirlives. Look at the number of devilswe have round about us! We have I should say, one hundred to every man, woman and child. One-third part of the heavenly host was cast down to the earth with Lucifer, sonof the morning, to war against us—which I suppose will number onehundred million devils—and they labor to overthrow all the saints and the kingdom of God. They even tried to overthrow Jesus Christ; they overthrew Judas, and they have succeeded in overthrowing agood many Latter-day Saints, whohad a name and standing among us, who undertook to build themselves up instead of the kingdom of Godand when men having this priest-hood—I do not care whether it wasin the days of Adam, in the days of Moses, in the days of Joseph Smith, or in the days of Brigham Young, I care not in what day they lived—ifthey bore this priesthood and under-took to use it for any other purposethan the building up of the kingdom of God, then amen to the power and priesthood of such men.The Lord will have a people to carry on his purposes who will obey and serve him. He has a good many people in this day and age of the world, who will be faithful untodeath, whether called to seal their testimony with their blood or not.He has a people who will maintain his work while they are here. But here is the danger, ye Latter-daySaints, and the Savior saw it veryplainly, and has left in onrecord in the earth: He comparedthe kingdon of God unto ten vir-gins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom."And five of them were wise and five were foolish. They that werefoolish took their lamps and took nooil with them; But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Then all thosevirgins arose and trimmed theirlamps. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. But the wise answered saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you; but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage; and thedoor was shut. Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord,Lord, open to us. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not." Now, those who have got oil in their lamps, are men who live their religion, pay theirtithing, pay their debts, keep thecommandments of God, and do notblaspheme his name; men and wo-men who walk in the light of the Lord; men and women who not sell their birthright for a mess ofpottage or for a little gold or silver; these are those that will be valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ.This is the way I feel to-day. Ifeel to warn my brethren and sisters, the Latter-day Saints, to live their religion, to trim their lamps, becauseas the Lord lives his word will befulfilled. The coming of Jesus is nigh at the door. These judgments that I have read will come to pass, and though Brigham, Joseph, Noah,Daniel and Job, or anybody elsewere in the land, they could not de-liver their own souls by their right-eousness. The man that is righte-ous cannot save the wicked. We have got to live our own righteous-ness, that is keep the command-ments of God.We are approaching changes.There are judgments at our door. There are judgments at the door of this nation, and at the door of Great Babylon. How do the world feelto-day? How does our nation feel? Something similar to Belshazzar, the king. On the night that he drank out of the golden and silver vessels, with his princes and his wives, hethought, "Well, I made this coun-try. I made this city. I am the godof this country;" but when the Lord Almighty manifested his displeasure by the writing on thewall, the scene was changed. His kingdom was broken up and givento the Medes and Persians. Hisgreatness, his gold and silver did not save him. In the same way theLord in ancient days swept awaygreat cities when they were ripened ininiquity. Jerusalem was overthrownin fulfilment of the words of the Lord. Jeremiah and Isaiah prophe-sied what would come to pass, and itwas fulfilled to the very letter. So I say to the Gentiles, so I say to theLatter-day Saints. What the Lordhas spoken concerning our nation,and concerning the nations of theearth—notwithstanding that theunbelief of the world may be great, notwithstanding that they may re-ject the word of God and seek to putthe servants of God to death—willall be fulfilled. War, pestilence, famine, earthquakes and stormsawait this generation. These calam-ities will overtake the world as God lives, and no power can prevent them. Therefore I say to the El-ders of Israel, be faithful. We havehad the priesthood given to us, and if we fail to use it aright, we shall be brought under condemnation. There-fore, let us round up our shoulders and bear off the kingdom. Let uslabor to obtain the holy spirit—andpower of the gospel of Jesus Christ—which has been put into our hands, and inasmuch as we do this,the blessing of God will attend our efforts.We have been here a number of years. We have preached the gos-pel and labored to build up this king-dom. Many have been associated with this Church almost from thebeginning. Many have been taken away. Joseph and Hyrum sealed their testimony with their blood. Many have passed to the other sideof the vail, and many others of us will soon follow them; but I do not want when I get there to have itsaid, "When you were in the fleshyou had the priesthood, you had the power to rebuke sin, but you were not man enough to chastise the un-godly." Neither do I want my rela-tives to rise up and say "You had the power to do a work for the re-demption of the dead, but you haveneglected these things." I do notwant these things to rise up againstme. As for gold and silver, they 
 DISCOURSEBY APOSTLE W. WOODRUFF,DELIVEREDIn the Assembly Hall, on Sunday Afternoon, March 26th, 1882.REPORTED BY G. F. GIBBS.I feel disposed to read a few versesfrom ##Doctrine and Covenants 43:17-35|section 43## of the Doctrine and Covenants, a book containing the revelations of God to the Latter-day Saints, communicated throughthe prophet Joseph Smith.J120576 - 77(The speaker then read the whole of the section, commencing at the 17th verse.)J120577There is one thing I wish to say to the congregation, and I would saythe same to the whole world if I had the power; it is this: I have heard the Prophet Joseph Smith say on several occasions when speaking on the agency of man, andthe liberty and rights of men, thatif he were emperor of the earth, having control of the whole human family, he would give every man, woman and child the right to wor-ship God according to the dictates of their own conscience, leaving them to be responsible alone to their Cre-ator for their individual acts. These are my sentiments, and they are the sentiments of this people to-day, and have been from the beginning of the organization of this Church, and I trust will be to the end of time. And this we believe to be a principle emanating from heaven; and while we accord this right to our fellow-men, and while we de-clare it to be a heaven-born right guaranteed unto all American citi-zens through the Constitution of our country, we claim the exercise of the same right ourselves; and weclaim this right and privilege under the Constitution under which we live, and we claim it by the laws of God to man. And whenever any people rise up and attempt to make war upon the rights of men becauseof their religion, they go beyondtheir right, they transcend their own powers, whether their power be derived either from God or man.J120577You may wish to know why I make these remarks. I will tell you. Because God himself grants this right to every human being uponthe earth irrespective of race or color; it is part of the divine economy not to force any man to heaven, notto coerce the mind but to leave it free to act for itself. He lays before His creature man the everlasting Gospel, the principles of life and sal-vation, and then leaves him to choose for himself or to reject forhimself, with the definite under-standing that he becomes responsi-ble to Him for the results of his acts.J120577 - 78It is upon this principle that weas Latter-day Saints assert our rights and endeavor to enjoy our privileges. And we are accorded this right inaccepting the Gospel dispensation in which we live, and in believing inthe Old and New Testaments, the records of God's people who lived inwhat is called the old world, as wellas in the Book of Mormon, the his-tory of the ancient inhabitants of our land, which records are in har-mony with each other, bearing wit-ness of the one great Head and of theGospel which He taught in Jerusa-lem and Judea, and which His Apostles preached after He left them. It is, in fact, the same Gos-pel that has been taught to man in every age and dispensation, as there isbut the one Gospel, and that Gos-pel is adapted to the wants and con-ditions of all men. It is the Gospel of Truth, and truth alone can makeus free, free from sin and from the power of the adversary. And this is the Gospel which we have received, and which we take the liberty of preaching to our fellow-men.J120578 I do not suppose that there has been any dispensation upon the earth in which a greater variety of evidence, or important evidence of the divini-ty of the latter-day work has been given than that which is occurring, and that will continue to occur until the second coming of the Son ofMan. There is no man uponthe earth who believes in the literal ful-fillment of prophecy as contained in the Old and New Testament, but who must in his heart believe that the God of heaven will in the latter days set His hand to perform a greatwork and a wonder in the earth; thatHe will call forth His Church out of the wilderness of darkness and es-tablish it upon the foundation ofApostles and Prophets with Christ Jesus as the chief corner stone. There is no man that believes in theRevelations of St. John who doesnot believe in his heart that in thelast dispensation the angel as seen and described by John in his vision, will fly through the midst of heaven having the everlasting Gospel to commit to man again upon the earth, and that this Gospel is to be preached in plainness and power toevery nation, kindred, tongue and people upon the whole earth. [##Revelation 14:6##] There is no man that believes in the literal fulfilment of the revelations of God through the Prophets who does not believe that the Lord will in the latter days gather a people togetherout of every nation under heaven; and that He will also gather the dis-persed of Judah—the Jews—that have been trodden under the feet of the Gentiles for the last 1,800 years for shedding the blood of the Mes-siah.J120578 - 79 I wish to bear my testimony to all men within the sound of my voiceand those to whom my words shall come, that we are living in that dis-pensation of God to man that every Prophet and Apostle that has ever breathed the breath of life has pointed to. I bear my testimony that God, in fulfilment of the Rev-elations of St. John, has sent the heavenly messenger to communicateto man the everlasting Gospel. And why did the Lord reveal to Johnthat this would be done? Because the "falling away" spoken of by Paul had already commenced; be-cause John in his exiled condition sensed keenly that the Church would be overcome and driven fromthe earth, and by way of encourage-ment to him and information to all who would believe his word, the Lord showed him what should take place in the future. [##2 Thessalonians 2:3##] The Jews had rejected the Messiah, they had cru-cified the Lord of life and glory and they had also persecuted and takenthe life of the Apostles and others who were left to represent His cause;and John only was left, and theytried to take his life; but, in conse-quence of the promise he had re-ceived from the Savior prior to His death, they could not do it: and hence they exiled him on this island—called Patmos. [##Revelation 1:9##] When they rejected the Gospel, they rejected it in all its power and glory, its blessings, its gifts and graces, and also the ordinances of the Holy Priesthood—Aaronic and Melchisedek. With regard to Priest-hood we differ from the Christian world. We believe there is no man in heaven or upon earth that ad-ministers in the ordinances of the Gospel without the Priesthood, and we defy the whole world to point to a single passage of scripture from thetime of father Adam down to Jesus Christ, showing that any man had power to administer in any of theordinances of the Gospel without the Priesthood. And we say as Paulsaid, in referring to this delegated power of heaven, that "no man tak-eth this honor to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron:"and he was called of God throughMoses with whom he communicat-ed. [##Hebrews 5:4##] Therefore men cannot legally and authoritatively go forth to preach the Gospel until they are sent; and men cannot hear the word and be converted by the same unlessthey hear it through the mouth of a preacher who is sent, and who has power to administer in the ordi-nances of the Gospel.J120579  The Lord has established His Church and His kingdom; and wehave been laboring now fifty years and upwards in carrying out the in-structions which he has revealed unto us in connection with thiswork. And as men were formerly, so we have been commanded to goforth and call upon men to believeon the Lord Jesus Christ, and to repent and be baptised for the re-mission of their sins; and as they were authorized, so have we been authorized to say to all men who comply with these requirements,that they shall receive the Holy Ghost. But say the Christian sects,these things are no longer necessary,these outward ordinances are not now essential to salvation. We be-lieve they are. In this, of course, we differ from them, and we have a perfect right to. Jesus himself wentto John when he was baptizing inJordan, and requested baptism ofHim. But Jesus satisfied him by saying, "Suffer it to be so now; forthus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him." [##Matthew 3:15##]J120579 - 80Baptism by immersion is one ofthe ordinances of the Gospel, and the law had to be complied with, and hence Jesns set the example. But the Jews, as a nation, rejected Him and His teachings; and the Apostles were commanded to turnto the Gentiles. I say Gentiles, we are all Gentiles in a national capaci-ty; and the same Gospel that wastaught to the Jews was preached to the Gentiles. It never varied one iota;it was sent to them with all its giftsand graces, its priesthoods, powersand ordinances without any changewhatever. And Paul in warningthe Gentiles, told them to take heedand fear lest they fall, through thesame example of unbelief; for if Godspared not the natural branches, which were the Jews, why shouldHe spare them who were the wildbranches grafted into the olive tree.We all understand that the blind-ness in part which happened to Is-rael and which, Paul said, should continue until the fulness of theGentiles come in, did befall thechurches which had been built up by the Apostles, and that the Gos-pel, with its gifts and graces, its Prophets and Apostles, has longsince ceased to exist among men.The Gentiles fell through the sameexample of unbelief, until to-day aman is looked upon as a deceiver who will rise up and declare himselfa believer in the same Gospel that Jesus and His Apostles preached. Paul told the people in his day that God hath set in the Church first, Apostles, sec-ndarily prophets, thirdly, teachers,after that miracles, then gifts ofhealings, helps, governments, diver-sities of tongues; and they were forthe work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, for the perfecting of the Saints, until all come to a perfect man in the stature of Christ. But the Chtis-tian world do not believe in thesethings; they say they are done away,as not being needed. We believedifferently, and we have a right to;we say the Lord has restored the Gospel as it was preached to the Jews and the Gentiles by Jesus andthe Apostles, and we know whereof we speak. Joseph Smith receivedthe ministration of angels, in fulfil-ment of the revelations of St. John,and we know it. He received thekeys of the Holy Priesthood underthe hands of [John the Baptist (NT)|John the Baptist, andunder the hands of Peter, James and John, and from that day,through the preaching and admin-istrations of the Elders of this Church, God has given a testimonyto hundreds of thousands, of thetruth of this work. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] We believethis, and we have received the tes-timony for ourselves of its divinity.J120580 In looking upon this congregationassembled in this beautiful building, I am reminded of the mercy andgoodness of God to us as a people. On the 24th of July, 1847, I came here in company with the pioneers. At that time Utah was a barren de-sert, there was no mark of the white man, everything was wild and barren. To-day you may travel thousands of miles through this country, and you find towns andcities, farms, gardens and or-chards, temples, and tabernacles and schoolhouses and large con-gregations of the people and hosts ofchildren. And where did all these people come from, and what prompt-ed them to come here? You camefrom your native lands, from the different civilized nations, impelledby the spirit of the gathering which God has restored in connection with the Gospel; and you came in fulfil-ment of the prophecies of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah and David and others of the Prophets who havespoken of you. The question thatarises in the minds of persons whopass through our country and see the labors of this people is, are wethe dupes of impostors? Was JosephSmith a deceiver? There is a way to the test this, and we have testedit to our satisfaction. The great promise made to us when we first heard the preaching of the Elders of this Church was, that if we obeyedcertain requirement of the Gospel,we should receive the Holy Ghost; and this same promise is extendedto the world of mankind by our El-ders who are still proclaiming theseglad tidings of great joy. If that promise had failed we, my brethren and sisters, would not have beenhere to-day; and Utah would doubt-less be as barren as it was when wefound it in [18]47. There is no question in our mind, as to the divinity of thework in which we are engaged. TheChristian world questions it. This,of course, we cannot help.J120580 I want to say to the Latter-daySaints, you are living in animportant and interesting time inyour history, a time when the principles of the everlasting Gospel are being brought prominently be-fore the world, and it is but natural that they should find their oppositein misrepresentation and persecu-tion. Jesus himself, together withevery servant of God of every age,while endeavoring to bless and savemankind through teaching correctprinciples, made themselves un-popular and became the subjects ofhatred and persecution. And thereis no doctrine so unpopular to-dayas the principles of life and salva-tion as God has revealed them; andthere are none so unpopular as thosewho believe in and practice thesame. Truth revealed from heavenfor the salvation of mankind al-ways was unpopular, and alwayswill be so long as the world exists in its present state. Men do not wanttruth, and therefore they reject it, and they reject it to-day for thesame reason that men rejected itformerly, because they love dark-ness rather than light. If the Lat-ter-day Saints expect to become popular in this day and generation,they will find themselves greatly mistaken. There is a warfare goingon between truth and error, and this warfare will continue until Heshall reign, whose right it is to reign.J120580 - 81  I also want to say to the Latter-day Saints, you should exercisefaith in God; you should make your-selves acquainted with the revela-tions of God, and with the promises He has made to His people, fully be-lieving that all will come to pass as He has spoken it. And each man claiming a standing among thispeople should do his duty to the trust committed to our charge. Ourresponsibility is great before God and man. Any people into whosehands is committed a dispensationof the Gospel has a great responsi-bility. And Joseph Smith, Brigham Young and the Twelve Apostleswould have been under condemna-tion and would have rendered them-selves liable to the curse of God ifthey had not gone forth into theworld and borne record of this work.Paul was placed in the same posi-tion and he sensed it, as is inferredfrom these words: "Woe unto meif I preach not the Gospel." And this is our position to-day in relation to the world.J120581 - 82 I have been with this Church al-most from its organizaiion, and have passed through the various scenesof its early history. I have seen its rise and progress, and have witness-ed the power of God manifested in behalf of this people; and I want tobear my testimony thatthe God of heaven has,in fulfilment of the prophecies,set His hand to establish HisChurchand Kigdom in the earth, whichmeans no more and no less thanHis rule and His government, and that He will accomplish it, and there is no power upon the earth orunder the earth that can stay theprogress of Almighty God. But notnotwithstanding this, we expect to meet with opposition, with thehatred of the world; this, in fact, is the legacy of the Latter-day Saints.Said the Savior to His Apostles, I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you; if youwere of the world, the world would love you as its own. It hated me,before it hated you. [##John 15:18-19##] And what arewe going to do? We are going to trust in God. I have no fears my-self; I have never had since I heard the first Gospel sermon by the El-ders of this Church; for I know that God lives, and that He has set Hishand to establish His kingdom, andit will continue to grow and in-crease until it shall fill the whole earth. He has called uponus to proclaim to the whole worldthe Gospel of Christ, and we are do-ing it as fast as circumstances and wisdom permits; and we promise allmen what the first Elders promisedus, that is, if they yield to the re-quirements they shall know forthemselves whether this work is of God or man. Is there, I ask, any man or set of men dare make suchpromises to their fellow men? I answer, nay; neither could we do it did we not know that God wouldback up the word by imparting theHoly Ghost. He has done so from the beginning, and these people canbear me witness.J120582 The question may be asked, Whatabout the course our governmentis taking with us? Whatever ournation does or may do, it will beheld responsible before God; and every emperor, king and ruler willbe held responsible for the use theymake of the power committed into their hands. The Lord inspired themen that framed the Constitution of our country and has guarded the nation from its foundation,in order to prepare free people inwhich to establish His kingdom. Columbus was inspired of God topersevere as he did to discover thiscontinent, and thus prepare the wayfor a class of people upon whom theSpirit of the Lord moved to follow; and when they were oppressed hardenough they declared themselves in-dependent, and by the help of God they established and have maintain-ed the government which God gave our forefathers, which is one of thebest constitutional governments ever known among men. One of its chief and prominent characteristics is its guaranty of religious liberty, permitting every man to worship God according to the dictates of hisown conscience. This is a sacred right granted by God himself to allmen; and when the rulers or legis-lators of any land undertake by en-actments of law to step betweenman and his God, they by that actbecome responsible, and must sooner or later be made to answerfor interfering with a divine law.This is the light in which we regard the position of our ownnation in the steps they have recently taken against us, as a peo-ple. However, if I were to express my feelings to Congress and theleading men of our nation, and toour enemies and the whole Chris-tian world, I would say, do not weep for us—and we are sensible of thefact that they will not—but rather weep for yourselves and your chil-dren, for as sure as the Lord lives the evils that men seek to bring up-on us will return in due time upontheir own heads, heaped up, presseddown and running over. For it isan eternal law, and a law by whichwe are governed, that what mea-sure we mete, shall be measured back to us again. Our nation knowsnot what awaits it; the Christian world knows not what awaits it,and the blind guides that lead thepeople cannot tell them, and the result will be that both the peopleand their guides will fall into theditch together.J120582 - 83I will say another thing. TheLord never did bring judgment up-on any people of any generationuntil He raised up prophets to warn them of the impending danger. Youmay read the history of the great and ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon, Ninevah and Babylon andother cities th[a]t were built to defy all time and every power but thatof God; but when they were ripenedin iniquity they were cut off, theLord raised up men to warn themand to call upon them to repent; but when they rejected them the Lord brought judgment upon them and they were cut off in their sins. And so it will be with our nation and all others, when they shall befully warned and they reject themessage that is sent to them. Theheavens are full of judgment, and as the prophets have said, they will commence at the House of the Lord and then go to the nations of the earth. These things are beginning to make themselves manifest and therighteous and pure in heart can seeit.J120583 I want to see the Latter-day Saintslive their religion, keep their faith and do their duty, and trust in God. And if men persecute you for the sake of your religion, what can you do? You can go to God, and make your wants known to Him; and thatis our duty as Latter-day Saints. And as to our nation, they, as well as we, are in the hands of God; andI have nothing to say about them. God will deal with them; and whatthey sow they will reap, and He willdeal with us upon the same princi-ple. The history of the ancient in-habitants of this land, as it has comedown to us through the mercy andgoodness of God, fully testifies to this principle; as long as they did what was right the blessings of Godfollowed them, but after they be-came disobedient and wicked thehand of God rested upon them. Attimes when I reflect upon the great change that has raken place in ourown land in the morals of the peo-ple during my time, I feel in myspirit to mourn and to fear as to theconsequences. I was between 20and 21 years of age before I heard of a murder having been committedin the whole of the New EnglandStates. The first murder that wascommitted in our land from thistime I could remember until I gain-ed my majority, was committed in New Haven; and I well remember how the news of it shockedall New England. What effect has such news upon the people of the same region to-day? Throughoutthe whole of Christendom to-day,murder, whoredom, blasphemy, and their kindred evils and vices are in-dulged in, and unbelief reigns in the hearts of men. Men profess to believe in the Bible; but confrontthem with the doctrines and prophe-cies it contains, and they will at once either raise a doubt as to theirreal meaning or they will openlydeny them; and the few that acceptthe literal meaning of God's word,

 DISCOURSEBY PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVEREDIn the Assembly Hall, Salt Lake City,Sunday Afternoon, Jan. 6. 1885.REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE."Truth is mighty and will prevail"—Theintroduction of the principles of eternaltruth—The fulfilment of prophecy in our own time—The principles of the Gospelworthy of consideration—The unpopular-ity of the true Gospel—Peculiar positionof the Latter-day Saints—The kingdom ofGod predicted by the prophets—Joseph Smith—No power can stay the hand of Al-mighty God—the Gospel of Christ is the law of salvation—Mormonism unpopular—Persecution—Polygamy—Treat our fellow men aright—Commencement of the Mil-lennium—We are in the hands of God—Warfare between God and the Devil—Faith—The secret of the strength of theSaints—Responsibility of rulers, etc—Re-sponsibility of the Saints—Conclusion.THERE is a proverb or saying which I have heard a good many times in my life, and which I think bears a greatdeal of weight, and that is, "truth is mighty and will prevail." I think this has been manifested in every capacity in which truth has been used whetherapplied temporally or spiritually; whether applied in the capacity of nations, or families, or in-dividuals; whether applied to the world or to the Kingdom of God. I think that in every age of the worldtruth, whether it has been popular orunpopular, has proved itself, in theend of its labor, to prevail in all cases.When Columbus was moved upon bythe Spirit of God to cross the ocean to find a new continent, his object and de-sires were unpopular with those by whom he was surrounded, and it was only after a good deal of labor that hegained favor in the eyes of any of therulers of the nations whereby to re-ceive assistance sufficient to carry out his wishes. But in the end he prevail-ed. He found a new world, as it were,which to-day contains a population of the Anglo-Saxon race numbering fiftymillions of people. The commence-ment of Columbus' project was cer-tainly unpopular, but the result has proved it true. And so in all cases, whenever men have been inspired toreceive truth or to promulgate anyprinciple, which would be a benefit tothe human family, they have generallybeen unpopular. When Robert Fulton undertook to demonstrate the power of steam in a steamboat, the crowdthat gathered to behold the event, did not gather to see success; they gather-ed out of ridicule, to see a man fail in performing a work which they consider-ed impossible. But when the steam was applied to the vessel it moved.The invention was certainly very crude, but there was truth in it, and it has prevailed to a great extent; for steamis the great motive power of all themachinery in the world, in a great mea-sure. And so with a Scottish Earl when he announced that there was a man going to try and light the City of Edinburgh with smoke. The manwas looked upon as crazy. But there was truth in that smoke, and it lit the city, and it has given light to a good manyother cities since. The principle pre-vailed, and is now adopted throughoutthe world. So with Mr. Morse, theelectrician. He unsuccessfully in the firstinstance,—[in 1837-8]—sought aid bothfrom the American Congress and theEnglish government to enable him tocarry out his ideas; but ultimately—[in 1843]—he gained assistance from Con-gress, and his invention of telegraphywas demonstrated a success, and is now made use of throughout the civil-ized world. And so we might go on to show that in almost every instancewhen men have undertaken to intro-duce new principles—principles of truth—principles that would benefit the human family—they have generallybeen very unpopular until the truth was made manifest to the world.The same thing may be applied to the introduction of the principles of eter-nal truth pertaining to the salvation of the human family in a spiritual point of view. When our Lord and SaviorJesus Christ, stepped forth into the world to occupy the position to whichHe had been ordained of God, therewere but few individuals who had faithin Him, or who were looking for the coming of the Son of Man in fulfillmentof prophecy. Jesus, all His life, it maybe said, from the manger to the cross, was very unpopular with the mass of the human family, more particularly the inhabitants of Jerusalum. His his-tory is before the world. He died anignominious death upon the cross, and those of His own Father's house, theHigh Priests, and the leading men of Jerusalem, were all in favor of His death. [##Matthew 27##] Yet the Savior possessed truth. He offered truth to the world; He off-ered life and salvation to the world. But the principles He taught were un-popular in His day. He gathered around Him a few followers; but theacceptance of His principles cost themtheir lives, as it did the life of the Savior Himself. I do not know of a man—except it was John the Revelator—who escaped. They all died violentdeaths. They had to seal their testi-mony with their blood. Some werecrucified; others were sawn asunder,beheaded, or in some way put to deathfor the word of God and the testimonyof Jesus Christ. They were put to death for their religion. How is it to-day? What name has been more hon-ored, or more held up as an ensample tothe world than the name of Jesus Christ? The Catholic world, the Pro-testant world, in fact the whole Christ-ian world are professing to honor thename of Jesus Christ. The Savior had truth, but it was not received in His day and time.With regard to our own time my mind is often led to reflect upon it. Half a century has past and gone be-fore the eyes of this generation, since the God of heaven commenced, as informer ages of the world, the fulfill-ment of prophecy and revelation con-tained in the Bible—this good old book that the Christian world profess to be-lieve in so much. The Lord has setHis hand to bring to pass some of these prophecies and principles which Hehad foreordained before the world was, and which He has left on record through the medium of holy men whowrote and spoke as they were movedupon by the Holy Ghost from genera-tion to generation. Those propheciesare with us to-day. They are contained in the Bible, a book that is published by millions throughout the Christianworld. The Christian world profess to honor the Bible, and to honor theprophecies and sayings of Christ and the Apostles. But do they believe in the fulfillment of these things? Dothey believe in the fulfillment of theseprinciples and truths which are to-day being fulfilled in the eyes of heavenand earth? No. Those prophecies and those principles—which the God of heaven has set His hand to carry out—are as unpopular to-day throughout the Christian world as they were when Jesus of Nazareth stood in the flesh and proclaimed the same to the Jewish nation. We occupy the sameposition that they did in that day and generation with regard to these truths.Now, as I have said, truth is mighty. It always has prevailed in every age of the world. It will prevail in this dis-pensation as it has done in others. The God of Israel will no more fail to-day to carry out the principles whichHe has stretched forth His hand to es-tablish than he did in the days of eith-er Adam, Enoch, Noah, or Jesus, or inthe days of any other dispensation.The principles to which I allude—theprinciples of the Gospel—are weworthy the attention and comprehen-sion of at least the Latter-day Saints, and it would be well for the Christianworld to take them into considerationalso; for if truth is going to prevail in the earth it certainly will involve thedestiny of this whole generation, Jewand Gentile, high and low, rich and poor, Zion and Babylon. It will in-volve the destiny of the whole world—of the fourteen hundred millions of people who breathe the breath of life in it. And I bear record and testimonyas a servant of God, that the God of heaven has set His hand to carry out those great and eternal principles which He decreed before the world was made and which He has left on recordthrough the mouths of His prophets to be fulfilled in the last dispensation and fullness of times. Are those principles popular to-day? They are not? Whynot? Because the world is not govern-ed by the spirit of inspiration; because its people do not seek the Lord; be-cause they do not honor His name; butthey are governed and controlled byother principles. But the Lord will rule over His own Kingdom, notwith-standing the Devil has great dominion to-day as he has had in almost every age of the world. The inhabitants ofthe earth have their agency. They must use that agency according to thedesires of their own hearts whether they be for good, or whether they befor evil. But the day is at hand when the Lord will show the children of this generation that there is a God in Israel, as He has done in other dispensations when He has reigned. In all the his-tory of the dealings of God with man this one principle, sooner or later, hasmanifested itself: that virtue exaltetha nation, while sin is a reproach to anypeople. You will see that this has been manifested in the history ofall nations under heaven—in their rise and progress and prosperity, and in their fall and decline and in their finaloverthrow and destruction. You willfind in every instance that sin, error,darkness, falsehood, wrong-doinghave laid the foundation of the over-throw of every nation and city under heaven from the foundation of the world until the present time. What men sow they will reap, and whatmeasure they measure to others will bemeasured unto them.To-day we occupy a peculiar position as a people—as Latter-day Saints here in these mountains. Here is a peoplegrowing up in the earth who are organ-ized into a Church, called the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. How did the organization of thatChurch come about? Why, the God of heaven has proclaimed through His prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel andothers, whose writings are contained within the lids of the Bible, that in the latter days He would set His hand tocall forth His Church out of the wild-erness and out of darkness and error, and establish it upon the foundation oftruth, Christ Jesus being the chief cor-ner stone. The God of heaven also proclaimed through Daniel, 4,000 years ago, that in the latter days He wouldset up a kingdom which should neverbe destroyed; and the kingdom should not be left to other people, but itshould break in pieces and consume allthese kingdoms, and it should standforever. That prophet also declaredthat a little stone should be cut out of the mountain without hands; that thestone should become a great mountainand fill the whole earth; and that it should break in pieces all other king-doms. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] Was that Prophet inspired bythe Spirit and power of God? I say in the name of Israel's God he was, and so was Isaiah when he spoke of the gathering of the people unto the mountains of Israel to establish the Zion of God in its beauty, strength, power and glory. [##Isaiah 2:2-3##] The God of heaven also inspired a prophet as he stood upon the Isle of Patmos—John the Revelator—and in connection with the great events of the last dispensation and full-ness of times he saw, in vision, an "angel fly in the midst of heaven, hav-ing the everlasting Gospel to preachunto them that dwell on the earth, andto every nation, and kindred, and ton-gue and people, saying with a loudvoice, fear God and give glory to Him;for the hour of His judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6##]Now I want this congregation; I want the world; I want the Christian world; I want the priests of the day who cry aloud for the blood of innocence to beshed to carry out their desires—I wantthese priests and all who are laboring to overthrow "Mormonism" to care-fully inquire, whether those prophetswere inspired of God. And if they were inspired of God, whether it is right for them to make war against the work of God in the earth? Whether itwould not be better to let these thingsalone—to leave them in the hands ofthe Lord and allow Him to govern and control as He sees fit? And if thesemen were inspired of the Lord andmade those proclamations—with thou-sands of others in the Bible and in therevelations of God—the question is, whether this warfare against God and against His work is going to prevail? The wicked will have no such power; for the Lord has set Hishand to fulfill these things which havebeen predicted by His Prophets—to es-tablish His Church and Kingdom andZion upon the earth. He has called Prophets, and they were inspired of God. Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God. He wasa man raised up by the power of God. He received the testimony of the Gos-pel of Jesus Christ by visions and rev-elation as did John the Revelator. Angels appeared unto him and taughthim the ways of life. Those men who held the Priesthood—who were put to death in the flesh for the word of Godand the testimony of Jesus Christ—vis-ited Joseph Smith. John the Baptist conferred upon him the Aaronic Priest-hood; Peter, James and John, the Apostleship and Melchisedek Priest-hood; and all the Prophets who held any keys and powers belonging to theGospel, these also visited Joseph Smith,and conferred upon him those keys andpowers and authority to administerthem on the earth. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:8-12##] These are eternaltruths, as the God of heaven lives, andthey will prevail whether men believethem or not, or whether the wicked war against them or not. These truths belong to God Himself. He is the au-thor of them. He has given forth cer-tain decrees, and they will have theirfulfillment in the earth.Now, as far as the Latter-day Saints are concerned, I will say to my breth-ren and sisters we ought to contem-plate these principles. There isno power organized beneath the hea-vens that can stay the hand of Almighty God. He has set His hand to carry out His purposes. The world hate thispeople, because the Lord has called them forth out of the world, the same as He called His disciples of old. Thisis the position we occupy to-day as His people. Though our numbers are small, yet "a little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a [s]trong na-tion:" and the Lord will hasten it in His time. [##Isaiah 60:22##] A little one has already be-come more than a thousand, or a hun-dred thousand, and in spite of all op-position this small one will become a great nation, and God will hasten it in His time, because God is our friend. Now, these are truths. They have em-anated from God Himself.The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the law of salvation. No man can be saved without it. The Gospel is the powerof God unto salvation to every onethat believeth—to Jew or Greek, Cath-olic, Methodist, Baptist, or any other sect or party on the face of the earth.We, as Latter-day Saints, are calledupon to build up Zion. We have beengathered to be instructed by inspirationand through the medium of the Holy Priesthood in the principles of eternal truth. This is our condition to-day. Fifty-three years have passed sincethis work commenced. Joseph Smith dwelt in the flesh some fourteen yearsafter he organized this Church. Heholds the keys of this dispensation on both sides of the veil, and will holdthem forever. God ordained him to perform a certain work. He performedit. He stayed on the earth until his work was finished. All the keys, powersand principles which God gave untohim he left with his brethren; although whatsoever he left with his brethrendid not take from him; for as Jesussays in a revelation given in regard to the Priesthood:"Whoso is faithful unto the obtainingthese two Priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their call-ing, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies;"And he that receiveth my Father,receiveth my Father's Kingdom; there-fore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him;"And this is according to the oathand the covenant which belongeth to the Priesthood;"But whoso breaketh this covenant, after he hath received it, and altogeth-er turneth therefrom, shall not haveforgiveness of sins in this world nor the world to come."—Doc. and Cov.,##Doctrine and Covenants 84:33-41|Sec. 84.##Thus, although the Lord bestows up-on His servants the same powers andblessings that He Himself holds, it does not take away these powers and blessings from The Father. The Father possesses all He had before. The Son possesses all that he hath had given unto him. So do the sons of the liv-ing God. When a man bestows those gifts and blessings and powers uponothers, he does not lose them himself.The Lord raised up Joseph Smith. He organized this Church. It has been organized for 54 years next April. And what has been the consequence? Havewe had opposition? Yes. Have we had persecution? Yes. Is not the de-sire of a great many millions of peoplefor our overthrow? Yes; and a great many wish us put to death. Some mengo so far as to be willing to slay, utter-ly, men, women and children, because they believe in what is termed "Mor-monism," but which is really the Gos-pel of Jesus Christ. These things are proclaimed to the world to-day. Whatis the matter? Mormonism is unpop-ular. Why is it unpopular? "Be-cause," say the priests of the day, "it interferes with our rights. We preach for hire and divine for money, and if the Mormons were to prevail in the earth, we should lose our business, and we cannot endure it." "Why," says theworld, "you profess to believe in polygamy, and that is why you are per-secuted." No, you are mistaken aboutthat. The worst persecution this Church ever endured was before polyg-amy was revealed to the Church. We have had more prosperity since we car-ried out that law, and endeavored to fulfill it according to the command of God, than we ever had as a people be-fore. And here is the principle withme—I speak as an individual; I speak for myself. If this work is of God; if the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as revealed to Joseph Smith, is true, then God will take care of it; if the patriarchal law of marriage comes from the God of Is-rel, He will take care of it; He will protect and defend it, andHe will uphold the people that carry it out. I say this is in the name of Israel's God. And if it is notof God, who wants it? I don't, neither do this people. I speak of this prin-ciple because I want my brethren andsisters to understand the views I have upon it.I know we are engaged in the workof the Lord. I know this is His Church.He has organized it with Prophets andApostles in fulfillment of predictionsmade thousands of years ago. This isa work which was ordained before the world was. The Lord Almightynever created a world like this andpeopled it for 6,000 years as He hasdone without having some motive inview. That motive was, that we might come here and exercise our agency. The probation we are called upon to pass through, is intended to elevate usso that we can dwell in the presence of God our Father. And that eternalvariety of character which existed inthe heavens among the spirits—fromGod upon His throne down to Luciferthe son of the morning—exists hereupon the earth. That variety will re-main upon the earth in the creationsof God, and for what I know, through-out the endless ages of eternity. Men will occupy different glories and po-sitions according to their lives—ac-cording to the law they keep in the flesh.But I want the Latter-day Saints tounderstand their position. Our trust is in God. With regard to men, it is our duty to treat our fellow menaright; to leave them in the hands of God if they persecute us. The Lord has a controversy with this generation. This Bible, the Old and New Testa-ment, contains a vast amount of, I will say, tremendous revelations, tremen-dous events, which hang over the heads of the people of this dispensation. Arethese events going to fall unfulfilled?No; no more than they did in the days of the fall of Babylon, of Ninevah, ofJerusalem, and of other cities in the nations of the earth. When the inhab-itants of Jerusalem became ripe in iniquity; though Jerusalem was theroyal city, in which was the Urim andThummim, and in which sacrificeswere made unto the Lord, yet the city was laid low, and the Jews have beentrampled under the feet of the Gen-tiles for I,800 years. We are living at the commencement of the Millennium, and near the close of the 6000th year ofthe world's history. Tremendous events await this generation. You can read an account of themin the revelations of St. John; the opening of the seals; theblowing of the trumpets; the pouringout of the plagues; the judgments of God which will overtake the wicked when Great Babylon comes in remem-drance before God, and when thesword that is bathed in heaven shallfall on Idumea, or the world who shall be able to abide these things? Herewe are living in the midst of these tremendous events.We are in the hands of God; our na-tion is, and so are the nations of the earth; and when they undertake to overthrow the Kingdom of God, which is decreed shall be estab-lished, they have somebody to fightagainst besides Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, or John Taylor, or any other of the leaders of the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints. This war-fare is between God and the devil, be-tween light and darkness, truth and er-ror, between the heavens and the earth; and that God who has supported His work from the creation of the world, is bound to do it unto the end. Where have you ever read that the Kingdomof God would be overthrown in thelast days? You cannot find it any-where on the pages of the records ofdivine truth. No; the revelations of God will be fulfilled. And we must exercise faith in that direction. As the ancients had faith; as the worldwas created by faith; as Noah built anark and preached the Gospel of repen-tance for 120 years by faith; as Abra-ham went out not knowing where he was going by faith; as the ancientsperformed many mighty works, such asthe subduing of cities and kingdoms by faith; therefore I say to the Latter-day Saints, you are required by the God of Israel, your Heavenly Father, by his Son Jesus Christ, by the holyangels, and by every principle of eter-nal truth to exercise faith in the revel-ations of God, for they will be fulfilled as the Lord lives. [##Hebrews 11:7-8##] God is with thispeople. But we are required to heark-en to his voice, obey his command-ments, and humble ourselves before Him. And I thank the Lord that I have lived to see the time when I be-lieve there is a great improvementamong the Latter-day Saints. I be-lieve they are exercising greater faith in God. And there is a calmness pre-vailing among the Mormons—so called—that is a marvel and a wonder to theworld. The world wonder why we are not excited over the opposition that is brought to bear upon us by the millions of people who inhabit this continent, as well as by the people of the nationsof the earth. The reason of our calm-ness is—God is our friend, our law-giver, our deliverer. If the Lord can-not sustain His work, we certainlycannot. But He can. He has always done it, and will do it to the end.Therefore I say to the Saints, fear not. Trust in God. Let not your hearts be faint. Let your prayers ascend to the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth day and night. Ask what you want. Whenyou do that, the Lord will answer yourprayers, if you ask what is right. There is where our strength lies. It isin God. I have no hope in anythingelse. But I do look upon the Latter-day Saints as occupying a most glori-ous position in this day and age of the world. This is the first time since God created the world that he has ever es-tablished a dispensation to remain onthe earth until the coming of the Son of Man—to remain in power and strength and glory, until the Millennium,until He reigns whose right it is to reign. Behold what lies before you! Behold the power of God! Behold theprosperity of Zion! Behold the bles-sings which have rested upon your houses, your lands, your flocks and herds, your children—the blessings of the earth as well as of the heavens—in this mighty barren desert! Then whyshould we have any doubts or fearswith regard to the Kingdom of God? No! As a people we should rise up in faith and power before God andmake our wants known, and leave ourdestiny in His hands. It is there any-how. It will remain there. And withregard to our nation, I leave them in the hands of God; but I wouldto God their eyes were open to see and understand the responsibilities that rests upon them. I would to God thatthe rulers of our land—the President of the United States, the Congress ofthe United States, the Supreme Courtof the United States—would learn theresponsibility the God of heaven willhold them to in the administration of those glorious principles laid down inthe Constitution of the government of this country. The God of heaven will hold this nation, as well as all other nations, responsible for the manner inwhich these principles are used. If they misuse them, it will be their loss. If they trample the Constitution underfoot; if they undertake to deprive anyportion of citizens of the rights the Con-stitution guarantees unto them, they will be held responsible, and will haveto pay the bill. When innocent bloodis shed, it costs something; and I would to God that our nation could under-stand the blessings they enjoy. There is no nation on the face of the earththat has the same liberty that is guar-anteed to us by the Constitution of ourcountry.Have we any warfare with our gov-ernment? Have we any reproach tooffer them? Not at all. I feel sorrythat this nation should sow seedswhich when ripe will bring destruc-tion; for I know as God lives that ifthis or any other government departsfrom the principles of truth, become ripened in iniquity, forsake the Lord, forsake the principles of life and liber-ty, the God of heaven will hold them responsible. Judgments will come upon the wicked. When men depart from the principles of truth and cleave unto darkness and wickedness, they reap the whirlwind; they lay the foun-dation for desolation.I pray God my heavenly Father, thatHis blessing may rest upon us as Lat-ter-day Saints; that we may compre-hend and understand our position, our duties and our responsibilities to God. When I look, brethren and sisters, up-on this handful of men and women herein these mountains of Israel, say 150,-000, out of the fourteen hundred mil-lion people that dwell on the earth; when I realize the responsibility thatGod has laid upon the Latter-day Saints, the responsibility of building up this great Kingdom of our God, of proclaiming the principles of eternal life, light and truth to the world; when I reflect upon these things I ask my-self the question—What manner of menought we to be? Our numbers aresmall compared even with the inhabi-tants of this nation, not to speak of the inhabitants of the world; yet, as Isaid before I say again, the God of heaven looks to the Latter-day Saintsto carry on His work.Then let us be careful. Let us rea-lize our condition. Let us realize we are here upon a mission. Let us rea-lize that we will be held responsible forthe manner in which we fill it. We

 are of very little account comparedwith eternal life. When we die wemust leave the riches of this worldbehind. We were born naked andwe will go out of the world inthe same condition. We can-not take with us houses, gold, silver, or any of this world's goods. We will even leave our tabernaclefor somebody to bury. Our spiritmust appear in the presence of God,and there receive our reward for the deeds done in the body.Therefore, I pray God my heaven-ly Father to enable us to live our re-ligion, to labor for light and truththat we may not work in the dark,to live nearer and nearer the Lord and be prepared for that which is tocome, and eventually gain eternal life, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

I read them with a great deal of inter-est, for I know they are true; and, therefore, I look forward with assur-ance to their fulfilment in the earth. We have but a little time to spend on earth even though we live to be a hundred years of age, and we have no time to waste. We should live in such a manner that the Spiritand blessing of God may attend us; and then when we cease our labors here we shall pass hence to continue them in the same cause of salvation and redemption, and all will be well with us. Amen.

 should be willing to sacrifice every-thing for the upbuilding of the King-dom of God. Any man who will seekto save his life and desert the princi-ples of the Gospel, is not worthy of eternal life. How many have laid downtheir lives since the creation of the world for the sake of the truth? Je-sus Himself descended below all things. He descended, I believe, lowerthan any other man will be called todescend. Are we greater than Jesus?If we are called upon to-day to lay down our lives, what of it? Is it notas well to die for the Gospel's sake asto die for anything else? A mil-lion of men, a few years ago, sacrificed their lives for the honor of this nation. No matter what we maybe called to pass through. Let usmaintain our integrity to God. Where is the man whose mind has been lit up by the inspiration of God to com-prehend the celestial kingdom, or thecelestial law, or the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who can bear the idea of pur-suing a course whereby he will be cutoff from inheriting the blessings forwhich he has hoped in the future? No, I would rather die a thousand deaths than be deprived of those bles-sings. We have a long time to live when we get through here. There is all eternity before us. It will pay you,it will pay me—no matter what comes, no matter what this nation may do to oppress us—to be true and faithful to our covenants, to our wives and child-ren, to our God and to our country; it will pay us to be faithful to the end.I pray God that this may be our lot, that we may be true and faithful unto death, and inherit eternal life, for Je-sus' sake.  Amen.
