iate in the sacred ordinances of the Gospel of Christ? or to initiate men into the kingdom of God? The average merchant in conducting his regular business, when waited upon by one claiming to be an agent of a manufacturer, places his order with that agent fully expecting to re- ceive the goods. As the time rolls on the goods come according. to the sample shown and the order given. This fact alone is proof to the mer- chant that the agent was in touch with his principal and was a duly authorized agent. But if the good^s^ come not, it is strogng presumptive evidence that the agent was a fraud and was not authorized by the manu- facturer to take orders for goods. If this test be applied to the ministers of the various sects of the Christian world it will at once be found that they are self-appointed agents, not in touch with the principal whom they claim to represent, as their patrons receive not the goods. In other words the signs and wonders promised by the Savior are lacking and do not follow the believer, which alone is sufficient evidence that the so-called ministers are never sent of God. Jesus said "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature, he that believeth and is baptized shall be saeved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall re- cover." These signs though forming one of the most prominent features of the Gospel in the days of the Apostles are not to be found in any of the contending sects of modern Christendom. Such as hunger and thirst after righteousness become members of the various churches and humbly bow at their sanctuaries, believing the doctrines there taught. Hunger-i ly they seek food for their souls; thirstily they come, like sheep, to  the fountain, only to fingd that the storehouse is empty, the fountain is dry. The promised blessigsngs fail, the signs do not follow, they re- ceive not the goods. The grand secret of it all is, God has not sent the agents through whom they seek these blessings; they hold no author- ity to officiate in the ordinances of His house. As agents they are not in touch with their Principal. These ministers are self-appointed teachers of man-made systems of religion, they are teaching for doctrine the commandments of men.  From the time the Christian Fathers fell by persecution, death or controversy, from their original faith down to the time of the Emperior Constantine made the catholic faith universal through the Roman pro- vinces in the ^year^ 323 A D, the forms of the Christian religion were con- statntly undergoing a change. At that time there were incorporated in the Christian Church, heathen rites, which with the innovation added down through the ages to the present time, stamps that church to-day as one entirely separate and apart from the original apostolic Church. Without Apostles and Prophets through whom they might obtain the word of God, the Church has steadily drifted from its moorings unto ^onto^ the broad sea of men's opinions till it is split and divided into hundreds of different sects and creeds, no one of which can present an organ- ization to-day that even resembles the form of the Church of Christ. The ENDENTRY most important features have been eliminated. Signs and wonders and miraculous gifts, together with the fruits of the Spirit, set forth by the Apostle first Cor. 12th## have disappeared, and but the empty powerless form is found to-day among the children of men. The shadow alone remains; the substance has departed. And why? Because mankind have departed from the faith of the ancients. The rights, powers and privileges of the Apostolic Priesthood have long since been withdrawn from man, and all who officiate in religious rites do so without auth- ority from the living God.  If we examine and see how the servants of God were called to the ministry in other ages we can discover a guide to direct us in obtain- ing authority in this age. Moses was called from out the burning bush by God Himself (##Exodus 3|Ex. 3##) and when he was about to be succeeded by Joshua as leader, Hhe conferred upon Joshua the holy priesthood by the laying on of his hands. (See ##Deuteronomy 34:9|Deut. 34, 9##) "And Joshua, the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his hands upon him." Jesus when He entered upon His ministry, called twelve and ordained them, viz; "And He ordained twelve that they should be with Him and that He might send them forth to preach." (##Mark 3:14|Mark 3, 14##) Again He says "Ye have ^not^ chosen Me but I have chosen you and ordained you." (##John 15:16|John 15, 16##). Jesus said in His prayer unto His Father, "As Thou hast sent Me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world." (##John 17:18|John 17, 18##). The Apostle Paul evidently had this question of authority to meet, as he gave vent to his feelings in the following forcible language, "Whereunto I am or- dained a preacher and an Apostle (I speak the truth in Christ and lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity." (##1 Timothy 2:7|I Tim. 2, 7##). It was very gratifying no doubt to the Apostle Paul to be able to declare with such emphasis the fact of his ordination, and no wonder when we consider the way in which he was called. He was justly entitled to de- clare it, as will be seen by the manner of his calling. "As they minis- tered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Ghost said: Separate me Barnabus and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away, so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, andc" (##Acts 13:2-4|Acts 13, 2-4##) Paul then was evidently called by direct revelation of the Holy Ghost, and when the hands of the Prophets were laid upon him, he was sent away, as also was his companion Barnabus.  The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews makes a most positive de- claration on this question. He says: "For every High Priest taken from among men is ordained for men, in things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; And no man taketh this honor to himself, but he that is called of God as was Heb. 5,4##) ENDENTRY A glance at ##Exodus 4:14-16|Exodus 4, 14-16 and 27-28## will show us how Aaron was called: "And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and Hs said, Is n not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well, and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart. And thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do; and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people" Thus Aaron was called of God; and in all ages when God has had a people on the earth, His servants have been duly called of Him and ordained, and the stamp of His approval has been placed on their labors in signs and wonders and miraculous manifestations.  LACK OF AUTHORITY.  Not only are the Scriptures teeming with evidence that the servants of God were duly authorized, call ed and ordained, to officiate in the ordinances of His house in all ages of which the Bible gives us any ac- count, but the fact stands out in bold relief, that in every instance where men dared to act without authority the Lord manifested His dis- pleasure in a just rebuke for their presumption; as in the case of King I Sam, 13, 8-13##: "And he tarried seven days ac- cording to the set time that Samuel had appointed, but Samuel came not to Gilgal and the people were scattered from him. And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering. And it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him. And Samuel said What hast thou done? and Saul said Be- cause I sawst that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Phillistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; therefore said I: The Phillistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal and I have not made supplication unto the Lord; I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering. And Samuel said to Saul: Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God which He commanded thee; for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever, but now thy kingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought Him a man after His own heart and the Lord hath commanded him to be Captain over His people because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee." And thus he lost his kingdom and his life through daring to officiate in the priest's office without authority. Nor did Uzziah, king of Judah re- ceive any better recognition, for though he had gained the favor of heaven in his earlier days through obedience to the commands of God, yet in after years when proud and haughty and flushed with victory, he essayed to officiate in the Priest's office, as shown in the following: "But when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction, for he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the alter of incense. And Azariah, the priest went in after him and with him four score priests of the Lord that were valiant men. And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him: It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, ENDENTRY but to the priests, the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn in- cense. Go out of the sanctuary for though hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honor from the Lord God. Then Uzziah was wroth and had a censor in his hand to burn incense. And while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord, from beside the incense altar. And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him, and behold he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence, yea, him- self hasted also to go out because the Lord had smitten him. And Uzziah the King was a leper unto the day of his death." ##2 Chronicles 26:16-21## Such a terrible penalty, it would seem, should have been a warning to all succeeding generations to refrain from interfering with sacred things without authority. But another single instance is recorded before God gave them up to a reprobate mind, and this was during the days of the Apostles, and is contained in the following quotation: "Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying; We abjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew and chief of the priests, who did so. And the evil spirit answered and said; Jesus I know and Paul I know, but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaped on them and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house, naked and wounded. And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also, dwelling at Ephesus, andfear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified." ##Acts 19:13-17##  It would seem that the Christian world have learned a lesson from the reading of the foregoing passages, as they no longer attempt to cast out devils or heal the sick by the laying on of hands in the name of Jesus, knowing only too well that they have no authority to do so, and fearing the consequences as dire to themselves, either by receiving such punishment as was meted out to the sons of Sceva or by thus reveal- ing the fact that they were unauthorized of God, expose themselves to the just resentment of their deceived and misguided followers.  SALVATION FOR THE DEAD.  In this age of religious freedom when every man is at liberty to worship how, where or what he pleases, when the Christian Church is split and divided into innumerable sects and creedsand is still divid- ing and subdividing; where the opinions of men, crystalized into creeds, pass current as systems of theological truths; while spiritualism in all its various forms is rampant upon the earth, and its younger and more delicately molded brother, theosophy, is just bursting forth as a wonderful revelation from the unseen world, while darkness covers the eatrth and gross darkness the people, and the men are continually seek- ing for that which borders upon the sensational, the word of God comes forth proclaiming the principles of salvation for the dead as well as  for the living. That there is but one faith, one hope, one baptism, one way to obtain eternal life, either for the living or for the dead, is clearly shown by the Scriptures. "To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them." (##Isaiah 8|Isaiah 8##, ##Isaiah 20|20##). This shall be our guide, by this divine ENDENTRY method we are willing that all might be judged. Opinuions of men are not the words of God, nor is the word of God to receive a private inter- pretation as is clearly shown by the following: "Knowing this first that no prophecy of the Scriptures is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." ##2 Peter 1:20-21## Opinions of men shall not then prevail, but we will take the word of God for our gGuide, "And when they shall say unto you, seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter, should not a people seek unto their God for the living to the dead?" (##Isaiah 8:19|Isa. 8, 19##) Let us to the Scriptures then, and seek the word of God for a knowledge of the  dead.  After Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, fulfilled His mission among the living and was about to depart to the unseen world and per- form his work for the salvation of the dead; while he was suffering the pangs of death upon the cross between two malefactors, he was railed upon by one, yet worshiped by the other, to whom He said: "To-day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise. ##Luke 23:43## This saying has created a belief in the Christian world that the vilest sinner on his death-bed or the murderer upon the gallows by confessing Christ at the alast moment can be saved. But let us find out what became of the thief. Where did he go? To heaven? Not if the Scriptures are true. On the morning of the Savior's resurrection and Mary's visit to the sepulcher, she thought Jesus to be the gardener. Yet when He said "Mary" she at once recognized Him and  in her joy evidently sought to embrace Him, for it is said, "Jesus saith unto her: touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father and to my God and your God." (##John 20:17|John 20, 17##) If this be true, aare we not justified in asking the question, "Lord, if thou hast not been to they Father and God during those three days, where has though been, and where didst thou take that thief?" Let the Scriptures answer. Men's  opinions are worthless on such vital questions. "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit by which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison, which sometime were disobedient when once the long suffering of Noah God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water." (##1 Peter 3:18-20|I Peter 3, 18-20##) So then Christ took the thief to the spirit world and there undoubtedly preached the Gospel to him in connection with Noah's people. And why? "For for this cause was the Gospel preached to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to God in the Spirit." ##1 Peter 4:6## It would seem that this can need no explanation for by this rule all men are to be judged by the same law, whether they hear the Gospel in life or after death. And herein is the justice of Almighty God made manifest, for if it were not so, and if the modern Christianity theory should prevail, viz.—that all mankind who do not confess Christ are lost—what shall be said of four-fifths of the people on the earth to-day, and those that have lived in like circum- stances in the heathen world, who never heard of Christ? If, when all mankind are brought before the judgment-seat to be judged, and the heathen hears his sentence read by the ENDENTRY great Judge, "Depart from Me, ye cursed, into the place prepared for the devil and his angels, because you never confessed My name." ##Matthew 25:41## Would not that heathen be justified in saying, "Who are thou? I never heard of Jesus Christ. When I was on the earth I worshipped Joss and served him faithfully." To punish the heathen for not confessing Christ when in fact he had never heard of him, is contrary to the justice of an all- wise Creator. But God has provided a better way. All who have never heard the Gospel in life will have an opportunity after death, as clearly set forth in the above as in the following: "Verily, verily I say unto you, the hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live." ##John 5:25## "But," says the objector, "that means all they that are dead in sin," but read a little farther: "Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice." (##John 5:28|John 5, 25 and 28##) Again, "For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the  heart of the earth." (##Matthew 12:40|Mat. 12, 40##). By these passages it is clearly apparent that the Savior fore-knew His mission to the spirit world in the heart of the earth, and that while there, all who were in their graves would hear His voice. Not only was this understood by Jesus and His Apostles, but long prior to the Savior's day, the Prophets foresaw the work He would do for the dead, viz: "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant toof the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the 7 prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house." (##Isaiah:42:6-7|Isaiah 42, 6-7##). Here the prophet foretold the labors of the Savior. During His sojourn in the flesh, we have no account of His having brought out the prisoners from the prison, or proclaiming liberty to the captives, or the opening  of the prison to them that are bound. Had hHe done so, the Roman Gov- ernment would have had a case against Him, yet Pilate found no fault in Him. Hence we must look elsewhere for the fulfillment of these pass- ages. "And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high and the kings of the earth upon the earth, and they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison and after many days shall they be visited." (##Isaiah 26:21-22|Isaiah 26, 21-2##). Here is the final of a terrible picture of the earth's desolation, when it is to be empty, turned up-side-down, broken, dissolved, removed like a cottage, and the inhabitants thereof scattered. All are to be gathered, including the kings and the high ones, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, shut up in prison and after many days visited. What will be the object of this visitation? Peter has already told it, as Christ visited the antide- luvians, so when these have suffered the vengeance of almighty God in the spirit ^world,^ some of His servants, ministering angels, will be sent to visit them and preach the Gospel to them as Jesus did. "lift ^up^ your heads, Oh ye gates, and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this king of glory? The Lord strong ENDENTRY and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle." (Psalm 24, 7-8). What was the subject of the vision thus portrayed by the prophet and where was it to take place? He saw the Savior making His triumpjhial entry into the infernal regions, and with irresistable power the gates and doors are made to fly open, and the immortal King stands in the midst of the prisoners of the spirit world. Thus the full import of that beautiful passage of the psalmist David would read: List up your heads, oh ye gates of hell, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors of the prisons of the damned, and the King of glory shall come in, to the regions of darkness proclaiming liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison doors to them that are bound in hell. If the antideluvians after their long sojourn in the regions of darkness were had in remembrance before God so that He sent His beloved Son to preach to them the Gospel during the time His body lay in the tomb, what shall be done for those who have died since the Savior's visit to the spirit world? As His Apostles and all His faithful followers served Him in life, who shall saty that after death they will not follow His example, and continue to serve Him by going to the spirit world and there preaching to the spirits in prison who have died without a knowledge of the Gospel? And when these poor benighted beings after their long captivity under the reign of Lucifer, listen to the precious truths of the Gospel of Christ and become converted, straightway the question arises, How can I obey the ordinances of baptism? I am in a disembodied state of existence, yet my Savior has said: "Except ye are born of the water and of the spirit ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of God." Oh wonderful plan provided by the Almighty! The living may be baptized for the dead. It is very plain that this great principle was understood by the ancient Saints as will be seen by the words of the Apostle Paul addressed to the Corinthians: "Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for the dead?"

Dear Brethren:  The case that is now pending either before the High Council or Bishop's Court in which Elders Nathan Tanner, jr. are parties, has been brought to our attention. A copy of the resolution adopted by the High Council, and by which  these parties were suspended from the privileges of the priesthood, and to a certain extent from membership in the church, has also been submitted to us. By this action these brethren are practically disfellowshipped; and Brother Nathan Tanner, jr. feels very deeply the serious consequences which attend the adoption of this resolution, and has appealed to us for relief. We do not know what reasons you had for taking  this action previous to the hearing of the case, but naturally suppose you must have had good reasons or you would not have adopted a resolution that is so unusual if not extraordinary; but whatever reasons may be we think immediate steps should be taken to have the case tried and some decision reached concerning it so that these brethren may not be kept  in a position so exceedingly unpleasant to every one who values his  standing in the church and in the priesthood. It may be that the parties themselves are to blame for the delay; if they are they should be urged to take immediate action. If the delay be due to either of the tribunals, then we suggest that no time be lost in giving the case a hearing, as the passing of the resolution adopted by the council  was three months ago.

Elder I wish there were some more of such men to come and labor among their relatives if only for a few months. Yes! I have moved to the address of 118-10th St. While we held services on 29-11th St, a family of people had to live in the rooms below to reduce the rent, and we roomed there ^with Bro. Mortensen^.

A front room which we use for a bed-room and sleepingr sitting room, and a back room which we use for a kitchen. They cost us $15.00 a month. Any time Sister Tanner goes home I can give up the kitchen, but a front room alone will cost $12.00. I have been to a great many places that were for rent and this is the best I could get.

I also believe that the means  spent here will be a rich investment, and after  a few days will return with an abundant  increase.

Dear Brother:  Your very welcome of march 15th came safely to hand so I wrote to you on the 20th of march, I have delayed answering you  until now, not having of interest to write. I am of the opinion  that the Legislature would have done well to have allowed the  Governors action to have killed the Appropriation bill and have thrown the responsibility upon him. I was also hoping that some spirited  member would collect together a list of his infamous sets both  of a private and public nature and in a speach upon the  floor of the house brand him as a villain, and club him with  his own vile record, and have the same go upon the record, it is  very likely however that memorial to Congress may answer every  purpose. I am pleased to hear that the Indians in the south are  taking hold on the Gospel, I trust that much good may come  of it. We are just informed by the papers today that Miss Emily  Faithfull is going to lecture against us in June, showing that  the Ladies in Utah are in most fearful slavery or bondage. ENDENTRY The papers also says that one of our brethren has been sentenced  to one months imprisonment at Viena for missionary work in that  country.

We published the items in your letter, correcting some errors, that had appeared in the article that you  wrote to us giving advice to young elders. I have not  written to you for some time, from the fact that I had little of interest to communicate. Our missionary business moves quietly along here in Great Brittain. Since the killing  of our brethren in Tennessee, the press of this country have  been publishing all manner of vile stories on in regard to us.  The McLean affair, having figured prominently,  in the articles that have been written from some quarters and garbled extracts from the Journal of discourses and  Millennial Star, have been brought forward to sustain  the charges made against us, and if possible to destroy  the little seed sown. Quite a number of parties are  also lecturing against us, among them Miss Emily  Faithful, who paid a visit to our City I think in 1883. ENDENTRY Salt Lake Septr 25 1886.  Prest. Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother:  Yesterday we called upon Albert Carrington, by request of Franklin D. Richards and had some conversation with him in regard to his case; he says he is willing to do anything required of him, if he can only be rebaptized.  We found him quite feable, being just able to walk across the room, he claims to have paid his tithing and attended to his prayers regularly, always remembering his brethren, he harbors no feelings against any one, and bears his testimony to the truth of the work, he will sign a written complaint confession, admitting that he was guilty of ENDENTRY Mountain Meadow business, the  Statements of Apostate mormon women and askes them up  and deals them out to the gaping crowd—her standing in  society gives some weight to her utterances. It is hardly  possible though for her to do us any particular injury, as her  stories are of the old class having been exploded a hundred  times. Another person by the name of Joseph Johnson is also  regaling the people on the Isle of Man with a series of  lectures in which he is retailing many things of a vile nature  calculated to have a detrimental effect to the word in that  part of the vineyard. He has secured quite a number of  items in regard to family matters in Utah, to which he has  added whatever the evil one might suggest to his mind, and with these he hopes to block up our way entirely on the little Isle. We have yet another, no less a person, than the  notorious William Jarman, "who by the way is not far removed  from insanity," he is travelling around the country, lecturing  and giving an exhibition of some pictures, representing  scenes as he claims have occured in the west. If I  remember correctly I sent you a copy of the book from which  he lectures, he takes particular pains to go wherever we have  a branch of the church, rent a Hall, challenge our Elders to  meet him, and whether they go or not, he attends our meetings  on the sabbath day, listens quietly to what has been said till  the services are over, and then commences an harrangue to  the people, in which he uses such vile dirty language in  regard to the endowments, and other things held sacred by us,  that it is impossible for any one with any spirit to put apart  it. I have instructed the elders and saints to keep away from  his meetings, and that if he came to ours not to permit him  to enter our Halls. On the 14th I received the following.

The brethren find a few  old time saints, who are very generous, and hope that the way  will open up, by which they will accomplish some good.  Scandinavia is still alive and baptisms are occurring regularly  in the various parts of that mission. I now have 3 Elders in  Ireland, and they report their prospects as being very good  about 35 persons has been baptized in Belfast, and neighborhood  and the prospects are good for more. The Elders that left  home on the 11th of October, and also those who left on the 29th,  reached here in Safety, all being in good health, having  enjoyed themselves aside from a little seasickness, they have  all been appointed to and gone forward to their various fields.  Now comes their time of getting climated, and weaned from home,  and its comforts, which, takes about 6 months in that time  we usualy learn whether mens health will bear up in this  climate or whither it is best for them to return home.

Your suggestion in regard to outdoor preaching, I had already  put into practice by warning the elders to keep watch upon  each other and to give advice when either was taking hurt, from over exertion on the score named. When elders get off  to themselves, they are sometimes filled with Zeal and injure  themselves without anyone knowing that they are in the  least taking hurt. I have very little faith in the outdoor preaching as to the good that will result therefrom. All  we can accomplish by it is warning the people. In the  past 2 Years I believe but 2 persons have come forward  and received the ordinances of the gospel as the result  of the outdoor work so far as I can learn. And it is a gran question in my mind, whether we aint doing more harm  to our Elders by keeping them in this labor, than we are doing  good to the human family by warning them in this man ner. I have however felt to crowd the brethren to this work,  as the only means by which they could get an experience  in public speaking, and bring out within them full faith  and a reliance upon God, for no extremely timid man  can stand the racket, and face these crowds of people  and testify to the mission of Joseph Smith. It requires  iron nerves and iron wills. Some of the Conferences in England  are becoming very thinly populated, Norwich Conference, has left it it, only about 30 active members. The Bristol  Conference which takes in Cornwall, and several other counties  is said to only furnish 4 beds to the elders without paying  for them. The Leeds Conference is nearly in the same fix's  In these conferences where there are but few people I have  crowded the elders out, so that they might open make openings  where the gospel has not been preached for some years to  any great extent, they dont however meet with any great  success, and report that they are either compelld their their beds, buy their food, or remain out in the weather,  and suffer from hunger, portions of other conferences of  the mission continue to do pretty well in furnishing places  to sleep and something to eat for the elders, but the day  seem to be gone by, when the saints take any responsibility  in aiding to clothe them, other portions of these conferences seem to be barren and fruitless.

I am becoming very much interested in trying to open up a mission to I have been in Correspondence for some months with a Turkish gentleman one of whose letters I sent to Bro Taylor some time ago. I herewith enclose one to you—I would like two missionaries, men who have some taste for learning languages, and who could go to that country and make a successful effort in introducing the gospel in that land. You may have already considered this Matter, but you can read the letter to the brethren in order that they may judge of the spirit of it. I am pleased that Congress has  again adjourned which will give the country a little peace It is a fearful thing that the people should stand in dread of their lawmakers, and but for the faith of the saints in God they certainly would. England is passing through another trying experience in her political affairs. The Liberal ministry has tryed to enfranchise 2 Millions of Men—the law passed the commons, but the House of Lords, have made an effort to stop the law, not daring to reject it entire, they have tied it up in some form which prevents for the  present at least its passage. Popular demonstrations are the order of the day—and while this is done peaceable there is much clamour among the masses for a change in the consti- tution which will do away with the House of Lords or make them elective by the people. You have no doubt seen in the Telegrams, the unearthing of some scandals in Dublin. It seems to be an open secret, that quite a number of  Gentlemen moving in higher circles are charged with the crime of sodomy. These parties have been arrested and are being quietly investigated, that crime will bring transporta- tion for life if proven guilty. One of the Judges of the Assign Court of this County was found dead in a home of Ill fame a few days ago. He died in the arms of his paramour—this also is being secretly investigated. Cholera and small pox or talk of them at least seems to be in the very air. Our next Company will leave on August 30th, there will be in the neighbourhood of 30 returning elders, most of them will have been away from home nearly two years—and have labord as a rule to the best of their ability.

ENDENTRY Sunset, Apache Co. Arizona, Nov. 24, 1879.  Dear Brother Tenney;  I received your communication on Saturday night at the Springs 40 miles  west of here. I arose early in the morning and came to Sunset at night and have  counseling with Pres. Barth and our  united voice is for you to accept his proposals But we would like to know what  that 2 1/2 acres is reserved for and by whom. Cannot that be included in the pur- chase? And again does the purchase include all the water right of the creek or  does the west side hold claims to a part of the waters of the creek? Brother  Smith and myself both would rather you would buy out all the water right of the  town if you can. If the people hold the right on the west side of the creek  will they not claim the surplus water and play the Stinson game on us and still  occupy the west side and let their cattle run over our crops. We would like to  understand, as far as we can, cooncerning all these matters. We would rather buy  out the place if we could so as to make a Mormon town of it, and not be mixed  with Jews, Mexicans and Gentiles.  I am satisfied that Barth is a sharper and will get all he can and you will  have to be careful and in making the purchase with him do not let him have a  loop hole to crawl out, and if you can get the 2 1/2 acres you had better get it.  I know he is a slippery man but if anybody can trade with him I know you can.  I wish You would send me a letter by the bearer and answer the foregoing questions.  If your purchases will take all the water of the creek, if not what portion?  Will there be any water claim on the west, if so how much? Does Barth own the  2 1/2 acres and what does he want to keep it for? Will he ^not^ have a hold on a part of  the water to make us trouble? We would like information upon all these points.  Will there be surplus water for him or anybody else to claim to make us trouble?  We would like you to buy all the water rights of the place if possible. We  think we can back you up so as to make the purchase. Is sSt. Johns surveyed by  the U. S. surveyors? You say the 2 1/2 acres is on the edge of town on the east  side of the creek. I thought the village was on the west side of the river. Does  your purchase include the dwellings or any of them? We would like an explanation  of all these things. Brother Smith is anxious to have you buy out of the whole town  if you could, if not get all the water rights you can.  Of course you will not have a chance to consult with us about anything  after you get this until you get your purchase made, but do the best you can  and whatever bargain you make bind it with a band of iron so strong that no one can break it. Write by the bearer all you can about it and as soon as you  get the bargain send me word by mail.  I shall write to Brother Taylor immediately and tell him to have mis- sionaries who are coming to take possession of the place to bring cows with  them of the age you speak of. Do not fail to make the purchase if possible. I  Tthink that is all I need to say upon the subject. With regard to occupying  the Colorado Meadows, there should be means taken immediately to occupy the  place by the brethren. We are now making arrangements to fit up teams and  send 2 from Sunset, 2 from St. Joseph  and 4 perhaps from Snowflake and will send what we can to you to take up the  Meadow forth with, but we shall want you to go with them to go with them to Greers and help  them settle or locate and Gilbert Greer might make a claim and I want these  brethren to locate their claims so as to exclude the St. Johns folks from  getting a hold there.  ENDENTRY We will start them off forthwith and send them to you. I want all these  things kept as secret as possible until we get the place secured. We have  concluded to start 4 men tomorrow morning to St. Joseph and from there to  Brother Brookbank will take the letter to you from St.  Joseph. You will find him a No. 1 man and I want him to be with you in the  mission, I know you can work together like a charm and I now want to say to  you once for all this is the voice of all our Council and if you want any more, I wilol say it is the Will of the Lord that Ammon M. Tenney preside over this  mission. Therefore make no more excuse but round up your shoulders and receive  this mission and appointment and God will bless you and make you an instrument  in his hands of bringing many of the House of Israel into the Church and Kingdom  of God, who will be saved through your instrumentality. Therefore, go to, unite with your brethren and lead out in this work and open your mouth, preach the Gos- pel to the Lamanites or Nephites as you find them and prophecy unto them as you  shall be led by the power of God and the Lord will stand by you and you will be  able to accompllish all that your heart desires in righteousness.  As Brother Brookbank will not return, but will stop with you, therefore  send your communications to me by mail, unless there is a private conveyance  open. I want the Meadows taken possession of about the same time you buy St.  Johns or a little before so that they cannot get possession. Now if you make  any change in your purchase of St. Johns notify me immediately as I may want  to write to President Taylor.  Concerning your going to St. Johns with your family; if you purchase  perhaps you had better go there and take possession of it. But I want you to  go with the Brethren to Brother Greer's and scatter them through the Meadow  and take up all the desirable places as fast as the brethren come.

His son  Gilbert has the Spirit of his mission. I think if he has and can locate a claim  with the rest it might be well for them to do it. I would like you to see how  Brother Greer is and if he feels like it I would like him to help what he can in it.  I have given Brother Gilbert Greer a notification of his appointment as a  missionary to the Lamanites under your direction. I would like him to take hold  immediately with you and perhaps he can assist you in your temporal affairs.  Some of these missionaries who will go to the Meadows who to make claims as far  as they can I want them to enter upon their missions as soon as convenient.  ENDENTRY I do not wish to make any presidency in this mission separate from the  presiding officers of these Stakes, so while I am in the country I will give  Jesse  N. and Lot Smith, but while any of the twelve are in the country it is their  province to give counsel upon all these matters as far as they have an oppor- tunity.  I am soon expecting Brigham Young and several others from the north,  before long and we may call and visit you.  L. A.

President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City U. T.  Dear Brother:  A company of Saints from Scandinavia leave Liverpool to-day in charge of Elder Manti. with Elder Andrew Knudsen, of Provo, as his 1st and 2nd Counsellors Elder J. P. Toolsen, of Smithfield, as clerk and recorder. The other elders  returning are Jas. Anderson, of Bennington, Logan (who has added Nordberg to his name) Brig- ham City, Lewis- ton, Oluf Jensen of Brigham City. H. P. Jensen, of Provo. The company without counting the returning missionaries num- ber 176 souls 93 adults and 83 children (There is one amongst them who was baptized when eight years old—he says—who has been sent for by his twin brother who is likely to be sent back his appearance is so much against him ragged and rough. It is much to be regretted this kind of people are sent for, surely we have enough of the vagobond element amongst us. The saints have objected to his company so we have had ENDENTRY to berth him with the gentiles. We cannot be responsible for this class. His name is Adolph Peter Hansen aged 21, Booked for Salt Lake City. All this I learn by representation which should be reliable. It has pleased our heavenly Father to draw into His fold a young man who is the son of a clergyman of the established Church of England. He has been an earnest worker in education and in faith relying upon God to provide the necessary means, for the inde gent. His name is Thomas Richard Galbraith. He has been in the office a good deal and I have taken to him as an honest man. He is going to work his passage to New York hav- ing obtained a situation on the S. S. Wyoming He is a sailor having been apprenticed to the sea and travelled a good deal. He entered as a sailor but the captain has placed him amongst the stewards. He was going to work until he obtained sufficient means to go to Utah but I have advanced him the money feeling that his labors will be more valua ble to us amongst the rising generation. He appears to be a gentleman, humble, prayerful and willing. Has quite a good faith and trust in God and improves upon acquaintance although he has quite the ministerial expression that he has been trained in which will ^doubtless^ give way before the ENDENTRY natural education he will obtain through association in the Kingdom of God. I should have used him here in the work of the min istry, and he was quite willing, but I have reflected that it would be better for him to get a home in Zion and better educated in true principle, with some experience in the gospel to better qualify him for that labor. I have given him a letter of intro- duction to yourself so you may see him and if you think proper for him to engage in school keeping in the Latter- day Saints schools that he can do so. I  have also given him a letter of introduc- tion to Bro. James Jack who could intro- duce him to yourself when convenient. This has been entirely my own arrange ment Bro. Galbraith never asked such a thing. He said if he could reach Utah he was satisfied he could make his  living and was going trusting in the Lord, and this is what the Lord has done for him, for my natural suspicious nature would have prompted me to take no such course. I tell him he need not thank me for this but Him who has so wrought upon me to take this step. ENDENTRY The future will unfold whether I have been led right or not. So far as I am concerned I am willing to risk it for my impressions are he will prove true blue. I regret to inform you that Bro Filmore now laboring in London will have to re- turn through delicate health. With regard to Bro. Jas. Leaing he is the best missionary we have in the field. He is doing an excellent work in London presiding over that Conference and if it would be agreeable to all we should be pleased to keep him until next spring but if it is necessary he should return, why he will leave in October. Bro. Payne is a worker, he is a first class missionary, and has done a good work. Bro. Wm Kelson  will have to return through ill health He is hardly capable for the hardships  of missionary life in the British Isles. I am happy to say we are all reasonably well at 42 and join in kind love to yourself Counsellors and brethren with you.

President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  President J. U. Stucki  of the Swiss and German Mission has been down  with the small pox which he contracted in Bohemia  at the house of Bro. Dittrich. He was travelling through  the mission and taken sick while in Stuttgart with a  heavy fever and chills, pains in his back and head  which kept increasing on him until he broke out. He  thought he had caught a severe cold and kept moving  about filling his appointments being all the time exposed  to heat causing sweatings and then to chilly winds,  and made the trip from Bern in a  draughty railway car. He mentioned these facts  to show how miraculously he was healed by the  power of God being so exposed to heat and cold. When  he reached Bern Bro Brandley felt determined  to wait on Pres Stucki and nurse him, as he had no  fear. The Brethren administered to him and in less  than two weeks he was up again comparatively well, only weak. No one took the disease and no  one in the house outside of our own folks knew  that anyone had the disease. Bro. Stucki has hardly  any marks from the effects of the disease. He  has surely been very much blessed of our heavenly Father. ENDENTRY Bro Reichenberg  he sent for Bro. Saxony as he thought  it would be a good plan for Bro Dittritch to have some  help, but through a couple of traitors in the Church  a strong persecution arose. Bro. Dittritch was arrest ed for committing the crime of teaching an unauthor- ized religion, baptizing andc and the prospect was  he would get perhaps a year and a half imprison- ment so he concluded to give them the slip and  he was then in Bern. Four of his children had been  sick with the small pox, one of them had died and  his wife had been sick. His family is in a very  pitiable condition alone amongst traitors and  enemies, only a few Saints to sympathise and  they too poor to render any assistance. Bro Cannon  barlely escaped arrest. I think I have stated before  that the Swiss and German Mission will require  some more missionaries to relieve those who  are going home in the fall. They will want at  least seven good missionaries for the fall indeed  the field is amply large for many more elders. Prest Stucki is an excellent missionary. He says "The Elders feel well everywhere and they are blessed  in their labors more especially in South Germany  Four ^persons^ have been baptized in Saxony who seem to be  earnest and faithful. I am somewhat troubled about  the Turkish Mission. I receive letters from Bros Locander  With the exception of Bro. Hintzie and J. M. Sjodabl  ENDENTRY II  they do not seem to have much faith in the  Turkish Mission or in Bro Hintze. They say  he tells the people too much from pre-existence to  Adam being the God of this earth and that God is  only man perfected. The principle topic is a coloni- zation scheme, means for printing, and  house rent  and "backshish" which I am informed "is absolutely  necessary." Bro Hintze says "I cannot say what  we may need in means because it is all so  uncertain where a government is to be bought  with money. Then I do not know what to apply  for without knowing what our brethren will  sustain. Excuse me for a suggestion. As the  whole matter now stands, and as it is of  great importance would it not be better  that you and the Presidency at home see me  face to face so as to make proper arrangements as to our efforts here? It would save me ans time and anxiety." The above subjects of those  wants of the mission and schemes for getting the gospel before. the people, all requiring means are what the letters I receive are composed of. Bro. Clove is returning sick. Just about the time he has some smattering of the lan- guage enough to converse he is obliged to return. I watched to see binic until I wrote to  you but concluded to write for the prospect of acertaining how far I am at liberty to go ENDENTRY in the using of means for instead of one  establishment there are three expecting to  draw on this office. One in Constantinople one in Palestine. With  the exception of Bro. Sjodabl the brethren  do not seem, to have much faith in the  Turkish Mission only to kill time. They  have got the experience of Elder Clove  and have seen how he has passed his  time and of the labors of Elder Hintze  and his experience, seen the class of  converts who have professed to become  converted and got acquainted with the  opposition of all around them and the  absence of any interest manifested that  they do not write very encouraging let- ters. If you have noticed any commanica- tions from the elders in that mission it has  been about the manners and customs of  the people as they view it. Letters that seem  to have been written for a consideration to  help them to a little means in their needy  condition. But so far as missionary labors  are concerned they do not seem to have  much to write about. I would be pleased  to hear from you how far you will be willing I should supply this mission with means beecause  they have drawn upon us to consume all the  three hundred dollars appropriated. I wrote to  Prest Hintze asking about how much he thought it  would need for publishing some tracts andc and ENDENTRY III  telling I did not think we wanted  to buy the government for the sake of the  privilege to preach the gospel, that called  for the remarks I have quoted from his  letter. Some time ago the brethren got some  printing done in germany and all the tracts  were confiscated. In No 34 Star we have publish- ed a letter from Prest Hintze. I think some policy  should be defined with regard to this Mis- sion. Prest H. writes Our house rent £5.0.9 is again  due and I have no M. funds only to rely upon your  assistance until all affiers matters are settled I extract a portion of his letter for your consideration Turkey is a long way from home. It takes over  $20000 perhaps $250 00/100 to reach here. Most elders are  stripped when they arrive (I was even without  the necessary means to reach Constantinople and may as well state right here that I have  no present resources to raise funds. I am therefore  forced to look for assistance to me a continual  regret) There for the elders to go into the interior  and live takes another good round sum Hence  the fact is we arrive poor, and we nearly all need  assistance from home in some way, and that  assistance is not forth coming. Therefore we have had to ask your assistance. For instance my Bp. was especially instructed by Apostles F. D. Richards  ENDENTRY and John H. Smith to assist me and when I wrote  to him about the twenty pounds I personally bor- rowed of your office he did not even answer; He  is not a bad man but I understand my case is  among the common ones." Well I think I have  said enough about the Turkish Mission. If it  was now a question of dollars and dimes I  should hesitate to bother you with so long  a letter. The ani-mormons have been breathing  out threatnings and this office is watched. We are all well in health and spirits at present. Bro. Brookband has been quite  unwell but is better. We keep sending Bro John L. papers when there is anything of  interest. Bro. C. D. Fjeldsted writing from  Copenhagen Aug 12, says "There is quite an  opposition started in the Aalborg Conference all the Utah brethren except two having  been called before the police authorities and one already received his sentence of  banishment. Will inform you further as  soon as we learn particulars." The elders  had been successful in baptizing a member  and it aroused the priests so the brethren said.

President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  On Wednesday the 4th inst we were visited by the following brethren and sister who arrived in Liverpool from New York per Guion S. S. Nevada. There were three appointed to the Albert Spencer and Louis W. Simmons. Eight were appointed to the British Isles and were located in the following Conferen- ces Bir- mingham; Robert H. Hodge to the Edwin John Longhurst, to the Charles England to the John T. Evans to wife on a visit to relatives and business. They were all in good health and spirits. We held a council meet- ing in the morning with the missionaries and they were appointed to their fields of labor. They met with us at our evening meeting in Bittern St, and bore their testimonies and expressed their wil- lingness to do their best to fill a good mission. (Prest Jos. Leaing, of the London Conference, who was with us at our morning council, gave the brethren some most excellent counsel on missionary labors. ENDENTRY Bro. Joseph Leaing has expressed himself as every Latter-day Saint, or servant of God feels. He wishes to be where the Lord wants him. In your communication to me, of July 23rd, you say—"We think it quite proper for you to release Br. Jos Leaing so that he may return home if he so desires—" Now he has never expressed that desire. He is one of the Lords Own, a minute man, a bright live miss- ionary and waits patiently to be released when he shall receive that word. He has been here three years next month, having arrived here on October 13, 1886 and is willing to stay as long as he is required. He enjoys the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, and consequently knows that the work we are engaged in is of God, and guided by the Spirit of revelation, according to the order of the Priesthood that He had appointed to the responsibility of presidency and the directing of the labors of their fellowservants under His direction, or revealed will, and so he says "when the Lord manifests His will for me to return I shall be pleased to do so, but until then I am perfectly willing to la- bor wherever I may be appointed." As I un- derstand it, my beloved president, this is the true feeling of every disciple of Jesus Christ. It is, "Father not my will but thine be done." It is the glory of God to have such humble faithful soul who love to serve Him and  ENDENTRY keep His commandments, because they want to. Now I would be pleased to have your mind on this question—Shall Bro. Leaing stay until the Spring or go him this fall? I ask this question to satisfy my own mind as much as any- thing else. I will write more freely next time after I have received your answer. I have received a letter from Bro. Job Pingree in which he says he has had an interview with yourself and counsel and some members of the Twelve "in my behalf" I am at a loss to remember whatever I could have said to him to call forth such an expression. Bro Pingree spent a few days with us and we much enjoyed his excellent spirit. We talked to- gether very freely about the mission and the spirit of the gentiles. He had quite an experience visiting his friends and acquaintances. He was with me in the prayer room and I read him some letters from the elders, all testifying to the spirit of indifference in some places and mobocra- tic feeling in others so that he got quite an insight into the condition of the mission and I remember telling him that if he saw any of the authorities at home he would be well posted to give them a pretty good report ENDENTRY much better then I could do through the me- dium of a sheet of paper; and when he left all I remember saying was give my kind love to the Presidency, or any of the Twelve you may see and tell them we are patiently rowing against the stream. We have been sounding the gospel trumpet by preaching and destributing tracts and consequently have stirred up the people, unprincipled men finding Jarman are making a good living by traduscing the "mormons" have adopted a similiar mode of obtaining a living and selling Jarmans books of course all this inflames the people against us. You know how ready they are to believe anything against us. But we are busy doing all we can to seek out the House of Israel and trying by the grace of God to do our duty and tell the people what the Book of Mormon is and supply them at a cheap rate.  In all our heavenly Father has blessed us and en- couraged as in our labors and duties.  It is His work and we are only poor representa- tives of His cause, but we love to serve Him and labor in our poor way looking to Him for the increase, and grace ourselves to over come and endure unto the end in His Church and Kingdom. So far as we are concerned we are not discouraged. If the people do not want the gospel it is their ENDENTRY loss not ours. If they prefer the testimony of an escaped lunatic going through the land with a lying spirit traducing Gods people, why we cannot help it. Our Elders have been testifying to the restoration of the gospel and the authority of God, with the priesthood, to administer in the ordinances of His House, and offering them the Pearl of Great Price—Eternal Lives—and they despise them and their testimony, so it is not to be wondered at, they should crowd together to listen to and believe a lie, that they may be damned who have pleasure in unrightiousness and be- lieve not the truth. I do not know that we should condemn these people so much when we see the course being pursued in the gathering place of the saints amongst those who have been converted and blessed of the Lord, and their children who have been raised in the midst of light and truth. From all we hear through the press and from private sources, if there are not those in Zion ripening for the burn- ing as well as those on the outside world, why then we will gladly confess ourselves ENDENTRY mistaken. President Woodruff, the elders in Israel, at home or abroad, who are serving God and keeping His commandments are not discouraged. They understand the signs of the times and know that but few men will be left. The propecies do not point to the Church of the Lamb being so very numerous; they know it is a strait and narrow way that leads to life everlasting, and are more interested in making their own calling and election sure then getting discouraged because of the folly or in- difference of others. Do not think we are discouraged or weary of serving God, for it is not so. We simply trust in God and seek His counsels day and night. We want His will to be done, we want His Kingdom, not only for ourselves, but for the benefit of our posterity—of unborn generations. We want the government of God and the rule of His Priesthood—of righteousness—for we have all faith that where the meek and pure in heart rule we will have a reign of righteous- ness. With kindest love and blessing to your- self, counsellors, and brethren of the Apostles, I remain as ever  Your unworthy brother in Christ George Teasdale  P.S.

I would inform you that I recieved a letter from my wife yesterday informing me that she took two letters out of the Office for me, one from you, and the other  from Brother Asahel. She gave me the purport of them. I was  glad to hear from you, and all the friends and esspecially that the word had the desired affect in Aunt Cossetts family, and with others.

I expect you wish to hear where I am, and what I am doing andc. On the 19th of Aug, in company with Elder Portland on board the steamboat Bangor, foxr fox Islands, Vinalhaven. After travling 100 miles on the steam boat; we took a vessel and was landed on North fox Island at 2 oclok  Sunday morning following, entire strangers and about peneyless. We called at the first house and retired to rest, as we had slept none through the day and night. We arose at 8 oclock took breakfast. I then enquire if their was any priest or religion on the Island. they informed us theirre was a Baptist meeting house and church and priest in the centre of the Island, and that there would be preaching to day. In the name of the Lord we hastened to the place. Meeting had commenced. I sent for the deacon to come to the door; I told him we were servents of God, we had a message to the people and wished to be herd. he informed the priest of it. he invited us into the pulpet. After he closed they had a short intermission I then arose and addressed the congregation, and it was amid many peculiar feelings; knowing that it was the first time the voice of an Elder ^of^ the Latter Day Saints, was herd upon one of the Islands of the sea, to set forth the fullness of the gospel. When I closed I gave out several appointments for preaching in different parts of the Island, which was 9 miles long and 2 miles wide containing 800 inhabitants divided into four distrects having four school houses. We presented Mr Newton (this Baptist priest) the Book of Mormon he was mild, did not object to it, said he would read it. In the first fourteen days, we preached nineteen discourses, and the whole Island flocked out to hear. The priest began to see his foundation giving way, he was alarmed and began to cry against us and would not let us have the meeting house. But the excitement ^was^ so great and the people so much in our favor that on Sunday the 27th the people asseb assembled at a school house to hear us ENDENTRY While Mr. Newton had the meeting house to himself without one solitary soul to accompany him. Even the deacons of the church were attending our meetings and enquiring into these things and and calling upon us to visit them, and the sound went abroad to other Islands of the sea with rapidity, and they came over in their ships and boats to hear for themselves. On Sunday the 3rd Sept. I preached to a Large congregation assembled together from different Islands after I closed a very wealthy, respectable Lady came foreward and wished to be baptised. We repaired to the waters of the Hale lead them down into the sea and baptized them. These are the first baptized upon the Islands of the sea (to my knowledge) by the Elders of Israel, and they are the first fruits of our min- istry here. and On last Sunday the 10 th of the month, I met a large congregation at the same place from different Islesands, and and preached to them from Math 16 ch 17, 18, and when I closed another sea captain a member of the Baptist church came forward for baptism and also a  young Lady. We repaired to the sea shore, and while the people throng'd the beach I lead them forth into the ocean and baptized them both for the lade hands upon them and they received the Holy ghost and were made glad. On the Tuesday following three others wished to be baptized and the ordinance was administered unto them by Elder Hale which makes seven we have baptized. Thus you seae the Lord hath not sent us here in vain. There is many on our right and left ready as it were to step into the waters of Baptism. Calls begin to salute us from the different Islands come and preach to us, come and preach to us. We have visited South Fox Island and held five meet- ings with them, they came out by hundreds and filled the homes. South Fox Island is 10 miles  long and 5 wide containing 1000 inhabitants with 6 school houses no meeting house but a methodist church, and a priest in their midst. They have 3 saw mills and one grist mill these are all tide mills vinal haven fits out rising of 100 vessels for fishing and mostly from this Island.  The inhabitants of Vinalhaven are wealthy, healthy, industrious, intelligent, generous and very hospitable to strangers notwithstanding they are mostly fishermen. pop 1,800. Vinalhaven includes both of North Island is rather rocky and rough have some fine farms, rase good wheat, barley, and potatoes, which is the staple pro- ductions, but little stock excepting sheep which are numerous. they have but just finished haying and are now in the midst of wheat harvest. There is an aboundance of raspburies and gooseburies on these Islands, but are now mostly gone. not much of any other fruit. The timber is spruice, fir, and hemlock. Their is one Post Office and store on this Island. one tide grist mill, andc.  South Fox Island is as near without any form or void I think as any think I ever saw. It is almost impossible for the best historian to give an exact description of it. it is a universal mass of ledges and shelves of rocks formed into hills and valleys cut up into necks and points to make room for the coves and harbours that run through and through this Island. One may form some faint idea of it, on learning that it is supposed to be rising of 100 miles round the Island to follow the beach in all its crooks and angles. There is some small parts of this Island under cultivation but it is at the expens of great labour and toil. The hills are timbered with pitch pine and  spruce, the timber and bushes principly grow out of the cracks of the rocks, while the valleys are timbered in the same manner with fir and birch. this people procured their wealth and living wholey by fishing, perhaps their is no people that supply greater quantities of fish than they of this Island. many of them fish at Newfoundland and prepare them for sale here. their is many kinds of fish here around these Island such as Whale, Blackfish, shark, ground shark, Pilot fish, Hors mackerel, stergeon, Holloboat, Salmon, Cod, Pollock, Hake, Haddock, Shad, Mackerel Tom cod, Bass, Alewives Herren, Pohagen, Dolphin Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Scate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Muttonfish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers, Munkfish, Nurs fish, Sunfish, Sword fish, Tharsher, catfish, whiting, scuppog, Tootog, Eyefish, Minney's, cunner, Ling, Eels,  Lobsters, clames, scollops, Mussels, Wrinkles, seal, and Porposes andc andc. and many others not named. I have stood on the shore and seen large schools of Mackerel come up to us so that we could catch any quantity of them with hooks that we wished, also the beach is supplyed with clames in almost any part of the Island. The adjoining Islands are more fertile than these. In a clear day I can view with the naked eye about fifty Island of the sea many of which are inhabited, and sometimes 20 or 30 gallant ships are passing by us at once andc. I have not givien this brief history of these Islands because my mind is more ENDENTRY on these things than my calling, for it is not. consequently I wish to call your minds back again to my labour in the vineyard  I remarked that many came out to hear us on the priest became alarmed for fear his foundation also was in danger, and he came over whare we were baptizing and made friends with the Baptist Pilate) and called a meeting I went out to hear him. ##Luke 23:12## He commenced warm hostilities against the Book of Mormon and our principles I wrote down his discours and are to give answer to it next Sunday, at which time I expect to meet a numerous assembly I learned he would not be present to hear my answer so I arose and rectifyed some of his wild mistakes in his presensce before he left the congregation. The Baptist priest has written Letters and even gone himself to the main land after several priests to come over and help them, declairing if they do not come the churches here will surely fall. -But cursed is man that puteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm saith the Lord- But O ye priests of Baal your cry is in vaine. The God of Israel hath set his hand to recover Israel his people The stone has begun to roll. God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the wise, and with them he will rend your Kingdoms. The cry of the Saints is assending unto the Ears of the Lord of Sabaoth for Keys of his Kingdom on the shores of gospel of JESUS CHRIST and injoying its power. And the call of many from distant Islands has already entered into our Ears to come and preach to them. My own Book of Mormon has this day taken its departure over the billows of the great deep to teach those that trade in ships at sea, and the word and work is propelled by the arm of JEHOVAH. And every weapon formed against Zion shall soon be broken, and he that raises his puny arm against it, is fighting against God, and shall soon mourn because of his loss. I say these things are so as God himself and the Spirit beareth record and the record is here. Therefore O Babylon thy fall is sure.  My dear parents suffer me to drop a few words of my meditations on this paper. When I think where I am, what my calling is, and where I have been  and whare I shall be, and have to do in this generation, I marvel and wonder. I page torn myself. A few years since, I was tendindg mill as other men not expecting to do page torn to live and die with my friends. But how changed the scene, the last four years has page torn the plow, called me into the ministry, bestowed the annointing, page torn Blessing upon my head, and called me into the ranks of page torn seventy Apostles to pus page torn from the ends of the earth, and act a conspicuous part in winding up the august scene of these last days in rending the kingdoms of darkness, and error with everlasting truth. It has called me to visit 16 different states in America, and travel about 14,000 miles to preach the word of God, and are now standing upon the Islands of the Sea, and thousands seeking wisdom and instruction at my mouth, While at the same time its wise and learned complain Bitterly that I am sapping the foundations of their Holy religion, churches and kingdom, and the ships of the sea spread their canvas to bring captains and sailors to hear my voice. I say amid these truths I ask myself the question who am I. ^I^ am that poor, weak, ignorant, Illiterate Willford. then I have nothing to boast. No God forbid. It is not Willford that has done this, but it is the power and work of God. I'll acknowledge he hath chosen the weak things of this world to perform his work with, and if I glory it shall be in the cross of Christ  I cannot tell when I shall see any of you again. their was some invisidble power seemed to hurry me from Kirtland, untill I reached these Islands, and the reason was because of the great work to be done here, for the sound will go from here to a vast number of the Islands to prepare the way before us. But I rejoice that I had the privilege of visiting you at all. I now feel as though it will be my privilege to visit you again and build up a church in connecticut. But if I do not I pray GOD to send some one among you that will. I have great faith yet to believe that many of my blood relations and other friends will stand in the covenant before they die. yes I believe my  Parents and their family will, for I know they are of the Blood of Ephraim, and the Lord will never suffer the good my father hath  done to the poor in his ^day^ go unrewarded. I believe you will both live to see a change in this world which is fast hastning. it would be great joy to my soul to see you stand in the covenant. It is the work of God that hath called me to do as I have done, and it marvelous in mine eyes. I rather expect to spend next summer amid these Islands of the sea. I intend to visit Deer Island as soon as possible, it is but 12 miles to it. it contains 4000 inhabitants, and theirre is but one Scarborough. My friends may still direct letters to Scarborough. Give my respects to Cossetts family I think of writing to them both and also ^to^ Brother fullness of the gospel. Dear Parents Pray for me and watch the signs of the times. I want to see you all much but I'll be content whare God would have me. Elder Phebe both wish to be remembered to you and all inquiring friends.

I thought it proper to direct this sheet to you in consequence of the writing on the 3rd page which is the production of Brother Asahels pen which I found among his papers which appears to be an address to you. Whether it is a copy of writings already in your possession or not I am unable to say. But as I feel anxious to put in your possession all writings that you have sent him or that he has directed to you is the cause of my writing upon the same sheet. As Death has closed all communications between Asahel and yourself and our parents I feel it my duty to give you all information that I possess concerning his sickness and Death or any thing concerning him that will be of interest to you. I also feel it my Duty to write to you as often as my circumstances will admit and I have matter of interest to comunicate. I have much upon my mind at this time I would like to communicate which I must omit for want of time but I will touch upon some importent items Firstly I hold in my hands a letter Dated Farmington Oct 31st 1838 from James Dayson. in fine I have in my possession (I suppose) all the writings that were Directed to Asahel as well as his own compositions I took them because I supposed that I should be able to put them into the possession of my parents and Sister sooner than they  could obtain them any other way and I much doubt whether you would  ever obtained them had I left them in Terre Haute I shall give you information upon this subject from time to time as I write. I have not had time as yet to look over his writings but little and do not know what there is among them, but all of his corresponding letters with his Dear Sister and parents and  Azmon and myself and many other friends are among them there is many compo- sitions of his own of interest among them I was particular to enquire of his Smith concering his mind, his sickness, and death and I learn the following particulars that he was considered one of the first and most respect- able citizens of Terre Haute and his death much regretted  upside-down text Wilford Woodruff to Eunice Woodruff giving the Account of the death of Ashael Woodruff end of upside-down text ENDENTRY his clerk said to never find a more page torn task than to part with him he said he never saw a page torn mind than his he also remarked that he was very absent minded for several months before his Death cheerful most of the time but occasionly lost in Deep meditation he spent muc^c^h of the time During his last months among his friends in public at ^times^ almost to the neglect of his business this was a secret they could not account for (But I could have told them that it was his mind upon spiritual subjects he was convinced of light and truth had none to unbosom his feelings unto and mingled with company to pass away his time and c.) None knew his mind upon religious subjects he was moral in all his conduct far from any thing leading to disruption he often spoke of his friend, and doted much upon a visit from me he remarked when he was taking sick that he feared he should not recover. he did not convers upon religious subjects after he was takingen sick and I do not wonder at it for there was no spirit in Terre Haute to receieve it I wonder how Asahels mind would have suffered him to have remained there as long as it Did. the Land was as page torn the garden of Eden but a wicked barren place spiritually. I wrote Asahel a Letter which he received just before his Death in which my mind was much exercised I never felt like bearing stronger testimony to any person than in that letter I little thought that it was my last testimony to him I write a letter to him afterwards but it did not arive untill after his death There was three Doctors attended upon Asahel During his sickness (which was 3 to many) I visited my Brothers grave I felt solumn while viewing it poor man he had not a relative to attend on his bed side or follow him to his grave I picked up some small stones from his grave in memory of him I was sorrow that in the sale of his papers that some articles of his clothing was not reserved but every thing of that nature was sold I have all of his former account Books his journals compositions, his watch two silver thimbles and pencils and penknife and c. you can make any enquiries of me by letter concerning those things that you wish as soon as I can inform you where to direct a letter I am sensible that Asahels Death will be deeply felt by you all he was a beloved Son and Brother truly may the Lord comfort you all under this affliction. My Dear Sister since Asahel is gone It has given me great consolation to meditate upon the cause. you have persued continue faithful in the cause in which you are engaged and you will receive a crown of Life! O that I can but meet my Sister in the celestial glory the thought of it will sweeten my trials on Earth. Do not think that your Brother is Discouraged because of persecutions in the west. No God forbid it is true a number of our worthy brethren have sealed their testimony with their Blood of late, it is equally true that if it is the will of God your Brother is ready and willing to share the same fate. I tremble not at the approach of Death it has no terror to me I may be called to feel a Missourian's steel or lead for my religion if so and my work is Done I say amen, I am ready to meet it you may hear of my Death, but by the grace of God assisting me you shall not be pained with the intelligence that I have drawn back unto perdition I am travling through the cold of winter with a wife and child which is severe at this time but I endure these things patiently many of our Brethren are stoped at the Mississippi River because of there faith I may be stoped myself but I shall travel untill I am give me your prayers Dear parents and Sister while Asahel sleeps in Death let me be consecrated to live or Die for Christ. O glorious strength, O Blessed hope. If we do not meet on Earth if we  are faithful we shall meet in heaven. phebe wishes to be remembered to you also give our respects to all enquiring friends  Eunice Woodruff Your friend and Brother  Willford Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, April 21, 1880.  Ammon M. Tenney  Dear Brother:  I have tried to get time to write to you ever since I have reached Salt Lake City, but have never been in a situation to give you any information for the want of time and getting certain business done before the Council. Bro. J. W. Y. -John W. Young- saying that you had more missionaries than was necessary at the Meadows to hold the claims so you was going to put some of them into the Missionary field. I was glad to learn this. If you have men to spare, the sooner the better. Bro. Young telegraphed that you, Albuquerque to buy goods for a Co-op Store, and he spoke about taking contracts on the Railroad for our people. If the brethren could unite together and take a contract so as to pay, I think it would be a good thing, so as to get their bread.  Now, concerning St. Johns. How is that a going? Bro. Hatch wrote me that somebody was sent as an Agent to borrow 100 cows to make the first payment of Bro. Flake. I was in hopes that the people who went there would be able to raise that first hundred cows. I wish you would write to me and let me know how matters are at St. Johns, and what arrangements you have made for entering the land. I have got the privilege from Bro. Taylor and Council to use all tithing stock in the Territory to help pay for St. Johns, unless the brethren can occupy the land and pay for it.  This may be used as a loan and repaid when the people pay; I shall write to St. Joseph to unite with the tithing stock what they can, for we do not want that purchase to fail and I want you to  call upon Christofferson of Snow- flake, Bp. Richards of St. Joseph and Lot Smith of Lake of Brigham City to gather the tithing stock, and you use it for the payment on that purchase as a loan, keeping a strict account of what tithing stock you use for the purpose. I shall write to them about it.  I wish you would write to me as soon as you get this, and tell me how  things are with you, and what you have paid on St. Johns, and what the prospect is. Tell me where the railroad is going and what the prospect is for our  brethren to take jobs on it, and what rate. Direct from W. Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah Box 321. I feel anxious to hear from you, and want to know what missionaries you have in the field and where, and any news I will be glad to  get.  My kind regards to Sister Tenney and all the brethren with you.  Your brother in the Gospel, W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City May 25, 1880  Mr. A. M. Tenney, Dear Brother;  I received your two letters May 7 and 8, and ^they^ have been read to Bro. Taylor, and we are all pleased that things are as well as they are with you. A few items I wish to speak of. We sent word to the Priests and Bishops to assist in paying for the purchase of St. John in case of necessity, but as they can have no demand upon you until next November perhaps by that time there may be help enough to pay for the place without borrowing the Church stock, at least it might be well to let it rest until fall to see what position you will be in.  Concerning taking contracts on the railroad I think that would be well, but I think the Presidents of the Stakes should be consulted and a Committee appointed and some man chosen to make these contracts for the people who will do justice by the people and not pocket one half the people's earnings by their lax^b^or. Of course any man who takes these contracts on the railroad should be well paid for his labors. But there is so much speculation in taking railroad contracts that it wants to be well guarded. This work should be done through the Board of Trade or a Committee appointed by the people. But one thing should be guarded against, the Mormons should not underbid each other but get as much as they can for the work. Our people should grade all the railroad that goes through our settlements and if they act wisely they can get a good price for it. I think it would be well to consult with Lot Smith on the subject, as the work will have to be done by those stakes.  You will want to unite together upon that work, and all act honestly with each other, and let each have what he earns. I think the grading of that rail- road will give profitable business to many of our people.  Again Bro. Watkins gave me an account of some political or Elections matters with you concerning sending the next Delegate to Congress. I want to say concern- ing this matter. It is one of the most delicate things between this church and the Gentiles. There should be no step taken by any of the Saints upon this subject ENDENTRY or pledges offered by any of the people without strictly consulting with Lot  Smith, Arizona.  And the next Election we should have all the County Offices of Apache Co. Our people have legal votes enough to carry it. My feelings would be to elect as a Delegate to Congress one who would be the best man, (if there is any best) and the one that would do us the most good; but the Mormons must all unite upon this matter, there should be no divisions with any of the brethren upon this point.  With regard to your entry of the land of St. John, I have conversed with Prest. Taylor and he thinks I should consult a lawyer upon this subject, and I will send you instructions what to do Therefore take no further action until you hear from me upon the subject. Perhaps we can enter a townsite under the Arizona Laws, if not we will have to pre-empt. I do not want to trust to homestead, it will take too long But we have got to have honest men, if we can find them, to enter the land. But I will send you word as soon as I can get it.  There is another subject I was somewhat surprised at, that is the price of the claim of the upper ditch, for I understood when you made the purchase that you had all the water and land except a small upper ditch that Barths charged cows for, and when there was a failure in the purchase the 50 cows was knocked off. Now they want $7,500 for the purchase, which amounts to a bout two thirds as much as all the first purchase—that is something I do not understand.  Still, we as a people ought to own all of the land and water we can get, as we want as little mixture with the outside as we can help. I shall do what I can to send men and means. But many who were opposed to going make but slow headway. I have spoken to the brethren about appointing David Udell -David K. Udall- for Bishop of St. John and have had no opposition to it yet.  I realize that you want more Missionaries to go among the Lamanites and I will do what I can to help send men. I am glad you have good prospects for a crop, and that you have a chance to turn in barley. I think it is a fair price.  How do the brethren do about holding the claims on the meadow? Remember me kindly to J. W. Young if he is with you and say to him that I have written him  and shall write again soon.  Remember me to your family and all the Saints with you. I remain your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY LeSueur  Salt Lake City—May 26, 1881  Elder A. M. Tenney, Dear Brother: Your letter of March 11, 1881, is before me and I write to answer  it. I was glad to hear that all things were as favorable as they are in the payment of the St. John purchase. We have called something like a hundred men to go to St. John this season. How many will reach there I do not know. I hope it will be occupied by the Saints, so that the Gentiles will not wish to be there. I saw from a letter from Bishop Udall, that arrangements were made to enter a good deal of the land in the purchase. This I was pleased to see for I have considered this very important.  Now BrotheSr Tenney, concerning your remarks upon the railroad contracts, I wish to say that the Presidency of the Church were not anxious for our people to engage in the railroad business at all, but as so many were anxious to engage in it, the Presidency and the Twelve both felt that it was important that some of the Quorum should be appointed to go to Colorado and preside over the organization of our people in these territories who were engaged in the building of these railroads, and J. W. Young and Jesse N. Smith were appointed a committee to go to these territories and organize the camp, and to direct and control all contracts made upon that railroad and see that all camps of the Saints attend to their prayers and observe the Sabbath and to see that all labor get their pay. They received strict written instructions what to do, and E. Snow and B. Young went to Arizona for that purpose, but nobody complied with the instructions, and the consequence is that John W. Young was called to Salt Lake City and the Twelve and the Presidency have sat for days in investigating this subject, and the final decision is that John W. Young and all the others must abide by their instructions and take counsel in the matter if they maintain their standing in the Church of Jesus Christ of LatteSr-day Saints.  John W. Young has agreed to do this, to throw all of his contracts into their hands and to carry it on under their united counsel. And I would advise you and every other elder in the church, who are taking contracts upon that railroad, who are employing the Saints to work under them, to do as John W. Young has done, to take their counsel in these matters. If you are not satisfied with your settlement with J. W. Young, I would advise you to have E. Snow and B. Young to settle it between you.  Another subject I wish to speak upon and that is the Lamanite Mission. I had a great deal of confidence in you in this matter, as you had the Spanish and were qualified to labor there, and I was in hopes that you would be able to carry that mission. But it seems that you are engaged in the railroad business and I do not know whether you will ever by at liberty to do anything upon that mission. You wished me to appoint somebody else to preside and you would work with them, but I thought you the best qualified to preside over it of any one there. But as you have resigned, I told Brother Snow to accept of your resignation, if you could not attend to it, and appoint some one in your place so that the mis- sion may not be given up, for I do consider the salvation of that people of more importance than building railroads or getting rich.  I am always glad to hear from you. Remember me kindly to your family and to Brother Udall, if you see him.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City  May 27, 1880  Ammon M. Tenney St. Johns, Apache Co., Arizona  Dear Bro.  I have consulted with lawyers and friends about entering the St. Johns  purchase and after getting all the information we can, we have come to the  conclusion that the safest, best and cheapest way is to enter the land by  quarter sections. It is very difficult to enter a townsite and we have to pay  a good deal more to the Government and it takes all together too long to home- stead.  If you have not used your entry right, I would like you to enter the  Quarter which is of the most value and then put trusty men to enter the rest.  Those who enter will have to claim a house or shanty of some kind, until they  pay for it, and get a Government title before they can deed to others. You  will want to find out the sections, stakes, half sections and quarter sections,  so as not to make any mistakes about the land you enter. All persons will have  to go to Prescott to enter the land.  You will want to learn the Township, Range Plot Section, so as not to  make a mistake in the entry.  I enclose a letter to J. W. Young, which I will not seal for I have an  order in it for several persons who paid tithing to J. W. Young, and they may be  with you, some of them. I want you to see that they have credit on the tith- ing books, of whatever ward they may be in, as I do not know where John W. is,  I trust to you to send the letter to him.  I wish now to say that we decided in Council last night to send David Udell  - L. John Nuttall will notify  him. I have tried ever since I came, to get him appointed as Bishop of that  place, but I did not get it accomplished until last night.  I shall be glad to hear from you from time to time to know how you progress.  My love to your family and all the Saints with you and please excuse a short  letter now.  Your brother in the Gospel W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, May 31, 1880  Mr. A. M. Tenney,  Dear Brother:  I have just received your two letters and read them to Brother Taylor,  and our counsel is for you today, to those brethren who are at St. John, who  are taking land, that our counsel to them is to turn out in payment for the  land, oxen, horses, wagons, harness, or anything they have to help pay for it,  and not wait for the last day of payment.  I have written to you concerning the election. We want you to consult  with the presidents of stakes and their counsellors, the bishops and counsellors,  and all the people must unite together and agree whom they will vote for as  delegate to Congress, and then all write and vote for your county officers. The  Mormons have a great majority of votes in Apache County, and it is a duty they  owe to themselves to put their own men into office. You write to Lot and to  Jesse N. Smith and consult with them about it. The people must be united and  not divide in these matters.  I have already notified you that we have appointed David Wall, - David K.  Udall - as bishop of St. John and he has been notified of it. How soon he can  go I know not. You should reserve a good city lot and farming land for him.  You can ask him when he can come.  I am surprised that you have received so little pay on the purchase for  the number of men. All should understand that they cannot hold that land if  they do not pay for it, for it was bought for the Saints, but we expect them  to pay for it.  If you are likey to have trouble with the Apaches, you should all form  yourselves into a military company without delay and see that your arm and  ammunition are in good order and ready at hand.  I thought all matters were settled between Brothers Hatch. They  agree(d) to settle and bury everything (the) night of the settlement.  I am now notifying some men at Box Elder City to prepare to go to St.  John. We will send men as fast as we can.  You need not call for any tithing stock to pay on the St. John purchase,  unless you are obliged to. I was sorry to hear that Brother Johnson had made  such a poor -choice- out of his settling. I told him to go to St. John. Men  who take counsel will be blessed. Those who do not will suffer.  I have only time to write a little this evening. My love to all.  Your brother in the Gospel, W. Wroodruff per J. J. ENDENTRY Sunset, Apache Co. Arizona  Feb. 19th 1880  To the Latter-day Saints in St. John District:  Bleoved Brethren:  We have met in council at Sunset, and taken into consideration the situation of the town and land purchased by A. M. Tenney, and we have put a ^the^ price of the  farming land $8.00 per acre: and the City Lots at $25.00 on an average; and we have named our town "St. John," for it is at St. John. And we wish it distinctly understood, by the Saints who settle there that we do not expect to enter into any speculation in the purchase of this country, for ourselves or our Brethren.  Our labors in these matters are for the building-up of Zion, and the settling of the Saints. We have figured this matter as closely as we can, and we feel that we cannot put the land and lots at any lower price. When the land and lots are sold and the debts paid, if there is anything left, it will be returned, pro. rata, to those who have paid for the land: and if we fall short of the payment, we consider it right and just that those who have purchased the land, shall also pay, pro. rata. to help pay the debt: but we expect the price set, will pay for the land. Bro. Ammon M. Tenney was appointed to make this purchase, and we look to him to deal out this land, both city lots and farming land, to those who buy: the payments to be made to him. He is held responsible for the fulfilment of the contracts. We would like all of the Brethren that he calls upon to assist him in any matter appertaining to the settling of the place. We wish further to be understood that Brother Tenney has been appointed to preside over the settlement of St. John, and to preside over all meetings when he is present, until he is released from his responsibilities. We also appointed Brother Tenney to preside over the Lamanite Mission; the the reason that he has already opened the doors among many of the Eastern Villages, and is quite well versed in Spanish.  We have also appointed Brother J. Allred to assist Bro. Tenney, under his direction, and to preside over the meetings in Bro. Tenney's absence, until they are more fully organized. And we wish all the Brethren who take land, to do what they can, at once, to assist in the payment of the same. We have advised Bro. Tenney in relation to the Missionaries associated with him, as regards their raising grain for the season, concerning which he will instruct you.  W. Woodruff—John W.

Dear Brother:  I sent a copy of  the Liverpool Daily Post to Prest Snow, Jno. containing a report  of the mobbing of some "Mormon" Elders,  through the report of a woman that  the Elders had decoyed away her daugh- ter who had returned, with two children  and had to walk from Liverpool to  London andc. Well from advices received  from London we learn that the Elders  did not preach in that place, but  they held an open air meeting in Mile  End Road and had a splendid good  meeting and was listened to with a  good deal of attention. I suppose this  is the way the adversary is educating  his children to mob the Saints. In my  inquiries about copyright and the regis- tering at Stationers Hall I have come ac- cross the following—"A copyright extends  to 42 years." Elder C. W. Symons and  D. H.

These brethren are searching to find out  the copyrighting of all our Church works. They could find nothing of the Book  of Mormon. The officials at Stationers  Hall said if it was first published in  America, it could not be registered there. They also assert that the Doctrine and  Covenants was registered June 7, 1845 and  published June 15, 1845 eight days after  being registered and therefore gives it no  protection. The charge for searching is  one shilling a letter, it being arranged  in letters. They searched through two  letters from 1840 to 1873. They could  not find The Book of Mormon or Hymn Book. Prest Leaing is giving it his attention and  I hope before long to get all the information we  want. We are all well and rejoicing in the  truth. With kindest regards.  Your brother in the Covt Geo.

My dear brother:  I have just returned  from a very satisfactory visit to the Nottingham  Conference I left here on Saturday Afternoon 12.th inst and was met at the Depot at Nottingham by  Pres Jno H. Hays and some of the Elders from Utah. We held a Priesthood Meeting oin the everning. There  were fifteen Elders from Utah and several of the  local Presidents of Branches and local priesthood. On Sunday we held three meetings. On Monday a  meeting with the Utah elders in the morning and in  the evening I preached at Hucknall Torkard. Yesterday  after visiting at Hucknall I went to Mansfield and  held a meeting Elders H Y Tilley and  myself doing the preaching. We had a most excellent  time. This conference is in an excellent condition. On Saturday last Elders L. A. Cannon, E. L. Sloan and his sister left for Utah pr. Guion S. S. Nevada. When we received your cablegram we notified these brethren and on the following  day for the departure of a Guion Co. Steamship  they left for home. Bro. E L Sloan seemed ra- ther disappointed to have to return before the  completion of his mission, but Bro. Cannon having ENDENTRY been away from home over two years and a quarter  was happy of the privilege of returning. The Lord has  kindly encouraged some of the brethren by giving  them some precious souls for their hire and seals  for their ministry that has caused them to rejoice  and take courage in their labors. I returned this  afternoon full of thanksgiving to God for all His  mercies received a most excellent letter from folks  ^at^ Nephi and rejoiced in His matchless love and  kindness. In Sundays Chronicle there is a piece call- ed "Dying Mormonism" which I enclose that you  may see how the people are being educated (?) with regard to the Work of God. How ready the peo- ple are to believe false prophets. If the "recruits from  Europe" where as benighted and ignorant as this  "Travelling Correspondent", they may well be pitied. These wiseacres speak as they would wish it to be, but fortunately for the human family and the  righteous in particular it is Babylon that is  doomed and every plant that the Father has not  planted and not His Church or the Gospel of  the Kingdom. It is mail time and our ^Wednesday^ even- ing meeting so I must conclude. I am happy  to report we are all well in health and spirits.

In the company there are besides the returning mission- aries, 63 adults, 36 children, and 5 infants, total  112 souls. PrestJ. U. Stucki came with the emi- grants from the Swiss and German Mission.  Hise is well. Last Sunday I met with the Elders and  Saints in the Welsh Mission in a Conference held  at Merthyr and we had a very profitable  time. The anti "mormons" tried to annoy and break  up our meeting, but signally failed. There were  20 Elders from Utah and we had an exceedingly ENDENTRY pleasant time in our Priesthood meetings.  Tomor- row Sunday the 22nd we hold Conference at  Norwich.

President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, U. T.  My dear brother:  On Sunday last  I attended a Conference of the Saints in the  Leeds Conference which was held at Dewsbury  about 9 miles from Leeds. The Conference  House is at Armley, two miles from Leeds. The  only train we could use left Leeds at 6.45 a m  So we had to walk from Armley to Leeds in the  Early morning and it pouring down rain. We  got wet, it was cold and cheerless. When we ar- rived at Dewsbury it was about 7.30, no  Saints in the town and the Hall engaged  from 10 a.m. SWe stayed in the waiting room  until Prest  Tuckett went to the Hall to Ascer- tain if we could find a shelter until 10 a. m  as it was raining. It being Sunday morning  and but few trains running there was no  fire in the waiting room, we walked under the  cover of the station on the platform to keep ourselves  warm. Arrangements being made we went to  the Hall a fine cConcert Hall capable of holding  some thousand people, with side rooms for  cloak and hat rooms andc. The Elders and Saints had  taken a picnic, for all places of business were ENDENTRY closes, it being a very religious town where the peo- ple were supposed to strictly keep the Sabbath.  The janitor of the Hall did all in his power  to make the people comfortable supplying plates  cups and saucers, hot water andc which some-what  added to the comfort of the people. We held three  meetings. In the morning it was very cold,  no fires and we got somewhat chilled. In the  afternoon the gas was lit to ptemper the atmos- phere and we had some 118 strangers. I  felt quite unwell, took a chill and had every  symptoms of fever and cold. I remarked to Prest  Tuckett I was afraid I should not be able  to talk much in the evening when I was ex- pected to occupy most of the time. When even- ing came we had some 200 strangers and  after the evening singing and prayer I arose to speak  feeling pretty miserable and having nothing  to say. I commence tremblingly, but the Spirit  of the Lord came upon me and I preached  in power for about 70 minutes, and was  entirely healed. All the miserable feeling left  me and I was as well as ever I was in my  life. I was enabled to bear a strong testimony  to the truth of Joseph Smiths mission and to  plead with the people to investigate the prin- ciples, we taught, with a prayerful heart. My  subject was man's relationship with God and  the necessity of the principles of the Gospel and Atonement ENDENTRY sideways text Sept. 28 1889 Geo.

Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  Your favor of the  23rd ult was received and read with much pleasure  and I have deemed it wisdom to publish it in part  for the encouragement of the Elders that they may  redouble their efforts and work whilst the day  lasts. Prest Fjeldsted writes us under date of Sep. 21st as follows—"It is with regret that I must inform  you that we are meeting with quite an oppo- sition in the Aalborg Conference, as also oin  Bornholm, from which places now several  of the Elders have been banished so I have  for athe time being compelled to withdraw the  missionaries from Bornholm and send the  one (bro Norway  where also a brother Nielsen from Aalborg  Conference had to go a few weeks ago, and now  Bro. C. K. Hansen, President of Aalborg Conference  is also banished and Bro L. C. Johnson expects  to get papers served on him in a few days, but I have changed him to another Con- ference so perhaps he can evade the officers  and remain in Denmark. The police are  also seeking after the other brethren now laboring ENDENTRY In the afternoon I explained why we partook  of the Sacrament and what we considered  essential before we could consistently do  so. Elder wife attended  Conference. Bro Milner spoke in the after- noon for about half an hour and bore an  excellent testimony, was exceedingly interesting,  and listened to with rapt attention. We had  a fine successful conference seven Elders from  Rosel H.  Hunter, Wm J. Critchlow  Jno B. Milner and myself. Bro's A. Maw and Hunter  have been successful under the blessing of God  of organizing a branch in Hull and bap- tizing twenty two souls. They have pretty much  to sustain themselves in that Conference, Saints  few and far between. When I returned to  42 I found your telegram relating to  Bro D. M. McAllister and must say I am  exceedingly sorry to part with him. I told  him he had better leave with this Company  on the 26th but he said he could not in  justice as he would have to see to all the  business connected with the Company but  he would leave the following Saturday and then he would be able to arrive in ENDENTRY in Aalborg Conference and if found will of course  also be banished." Prest Fjeldsted also says— "Outside from these troubles we enjoy peace in  the other parts of the mission and the brethren  are meeting with encouraging success in  various places." He also informs me he has  sent a native elder to Preside in Alalborg. We have  had some little encouragement also. Last Sun- day I attended an excellent Conference of the  Norwich Conference. There was five to have been  baptized but through some misunderstanding  two men did not meet with the others, but  three were baptized and confirmed. In the  Scottish Mission also there have been some  baptisms. Next Sunday I expect to attend a  Conference of that Mission in Glasgow. We  have the half yearly statistical reports of the  Conferences of the British Mission and find  (193) one hundred and ninety three baptisms  (155) one hundred and fifty five emigrated (53) fifty three excommunicated and (23) twenty  three died; a decrease of (66) sixty six to the mission  (3230) Thirty two hundred and thirty, officers and  members comprise the British Mission, good  and bad. We have just published our Book of Mor- mon Ad broadcast, as much as to tell the people  what the Book of Mormon is as to make business  and so leave them without excuse. We have  sold some we should not have done if we  ENDENTRY the City about as soon as they would.  When you send a cable gram to send  anyone home immediately I should let them  go without any regard to business. You know  I am a minute man, but I cannot force  anyone away. Bro Mac is a man of faith  and trust in God, he is as calm as a  summer's morning, and is turning over  the business every day to the understand- ing of Bro L. R. Thomas, who has been as- sisting in the office during Emigration,  and he is getting his things together to  pack up and leave as cheerful and  unconcerned as if it had been arranged  for him to go and there had been no  telegram. Bro. McAllister is a man of God  one of natures noblemen, humble faithful  and true. I have lived with him here  two years and a third and can say that  he improves upon acquaintance. We have  in the office with us at present Bro S. T.  Whitaker who leaves on Saturday for home  and a brother George F. Phillips a young man of excellent family — as the world goes — and good education. He is about 23 years  of age. His parents are Catholics, mother is dead,  ENDENTRY had not advertized but not enough to pay us  in a financial point. We keep pushing our  business to try and sell books. Our next  venture is a cheap edition of the Hymn Book  so all our children and young people as  well as grown people, can have one for  one shilling. Our cheap edition of the Book  of Mormon for two shillings and our  Voice of Warning for sixpence has been  quite a success in spreading the know- ledge of the gospel and the scriptures. The  blessing of the Lord has been with us.  He put it into our hearts to publish  these cheap editions and He has prosper- ed us in our labors. I hope for the sake  of the work and of the people the elders  will not be withdrawn from the nations until He says it is enough. There is a  pleasure in laboring for the Lord, in la- boring for Zion, if it is uphill business,  or rowing against the stream, with all  its discouragement it has its lights and  shadows, its joys and sorrows. The exper- ience the elders gain is invaluable in fact  it is priceless. It could not be gained under  any other circumstances. Elder W. P. Payne was  ENDENTRY His grand father on his mothers side was a  Jew. He has always been religiously inclined  and educated in the Catholic Church speaks  French, Latin and is an organist, educated  to be a physician. He was assistant organist  at a Catholic Church. Of late he has been  dissatisfied with the Catholic Church and  had some interviews with a popular  protestant evangelist, but was disgusted  with the Come to Jesus declarations of this  gentleman and concluded the Catholic  Church was better than that. It happened  that the Priest of the Church where bro Phillips was assistant organist saw him walking  with and in conversation with the Evan- gelist, and one evening after vespers when  Bro P had been playing, the organist being  absent, the priest came to him and asked  him what he was talking to the evangelist  for, and Bro Phillips told him he was in- quiring into his faith and principles. The  Priest sharply reprimanded him and  Bro P. defended himself and told the priest  he was far from being satisfied with the Catho- lic Church. This added fuel to the fire, he was  told that to doubt was to be damned andc and en- ded by cursing him and discharging him ENDENTRY unwilling to return he made a most excellent  missionary. And as a general thing all the  Elders say when spoken to about their release or released—"Just as you say Bro. Teasdale" we  are in the hands of the Lord." This is the result  of intelligence, they know this is the Work of  the Lord that we are engaged in and that  theirre is an order in His Curhurch and feel safe  in sustaining that order. Your letter concern ing the release of Bro. A Judd has been re- ceived. We have telegraphed him for the  5th of October Company if he can get  ready. He will be missed in the Hol- land mission. Bro. Brown writes me  he does not know what to do with the  last three missionaries who have been  appointed to Holland as they cannot speak  the language and it takes a year before  they can be of any service to the mission  He is in want of elders who can go into  the field and push the sale of the Book  of Mormon and be an immediate help  to him. Our good friend Mr Ramsden  has just apprized us of the accident  that happened to the Wisconsin Company  that Bro. W. P. Payne had charge of. Is it ENDENTRY from the situation of assistant organist. He  was occupying a position as assistant to  a physician as he was training for the  medical profession. One day he saw a  scrap of a newspaper with a letter from  a Mormon Elder writen on it. He had al- ways believed the Mormons were a wicked  people. He was impressed to inquire about  them and he wrote to the Glasgow Mail to  make inquiry about the location of the  "Mormons" in Glasgow where he could gain  information concerning them and they directed him to the "Millennial Star Office"  and he wrote for information. We sent him  some tracts and referred him to President  S. T. Whittaker. A correspondence was open  between them and Bro Whitaker let him  have some tracts and he got quite interested  One day he went out to visit a sick child  leaving one of the tracts on the desk. During  his absence the physician he was with  saw the tract and read some of it and  when Bro P. returned he censured him  exceedingly for reading such stuff  Bro P. defended himself and the princi- ples advocated in the tract and this  led to the his dismissal from the physicians  employ. Up to this time he had not been  ENDENTRY not wonderful that no one was killed or  crippled in such a terrible smash up? Sure- ly it is another evidence of the matchless  love and power of God manifested in the protection of His people. It is marvellous!  Mr Ramsden has also caused the Post to  insert another paragraph concerning  that canard they published about "Mob- bing Mormon Missionaries" Mr Ramsden  says in a letter to me—"I sent one of the copies  of the "Star" to the Daily Post and asked them  not to give you the trouble of inserting  such articles for the future I think it will  do them good and make them more care- ful in future."—Mr Ramsden is our true  friend. I often think if we were all as faith- ful in our sphere as he is in his we would  all do pretty well. And this man cannot  see the truth as the Saints have the privilege  but if he was a member of the Church  he could not treat our people better  than he does. I should like to know if the  Post would have published that at our  request? I doubt it very much for it has  always been very bitter towards our  people. I am happy to say we are all  ENDENTRY baptized he was only investigating read- ing and attending meetings. When it  was known he was investigating and  likely to embrace the mormon faith it  caused the greatest consternation. The  priest was sent to reason with him  his father persuaded him but he stood  his ground got cursed by the priest and  disowned by his father. He had asked  for baptism but had been put off to  be more enlightened, count the cost andc  Bro Whitaker seeing what a cross he  was taking up was slow to baptize  him. However as there were some  converted to the truth who disired Bro. Whitaker to baptize them before he left  Bro Philips was baptized same time. A  number of strangers were present at  the baptism and confirnation. Through  this step Bro Phillips father has turned  his back upon him, would not speak  to him not even to say good bye. They  kept his clothes. He came here with Bro  Whitaker to see me. He wrote me to say  he was willing to do anything the Lord  had for him to do. I saw him and  ENDENTRY well in body and mind. We thank you  very kindly for your faith and prayers  and for the prayers of your counsellor's  and the Twelve, for they are certainly  answered. Jarman and Co are continuing their  lectures because there is money in it, but they  seem to have lost their influence. We are  letting them severely alone and this seems  the best way to do. The Lord is certainly  able to do His own work, and from the  very fact that He has allowed Jarman and Co.  to travel and vilify His people for so  many years is an evidence that it is  for a purpose hereafter to be developed.  With kindest love to the First Presidency,  The Twelve and all associated with you and with continual prayers for your wel- fare and blessing  I remain, as ever, Your brother in the gospel George Teasdale ENDENTRY conversed with him at the Conference of the  Scottish Mission, he was not in the Church then.  I had intended to let him go into the field  and labor to give him an experience but I  find him so useful that he has been assisting  us in the office this week. Your much valued  favor of the 25th ult came safe to hand and read  with much interest. I regret exceedingly that  you lent Bro. Galbraith any money. He was  going to work his way to Utah. He did work  his passage across the sea. He appeared to me  to have been brought into the Church for a  wise purpose in the Lord and seemed to be  an honest man. I should not have taken  the liberty to introduce him to you if I had  dreamed he would have taken an undue  advantage of the introduction. He expressed  himself as desiring to spend his life in the  service of God and teach the young, preach  the Gospel and labor anyhwere he might be  of use. I only wanted you to see him and  if you thought proper and there was a va- cancy in some of the coutown or country set- tlements where he gcould get an experience  after he had got located that he might have  the chance of it — But I am ashamed of having  written so long a letter so will conclude with Kindest love from all to all your brother in the Gospel  Geo.

October 29th 1889.  President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  On Saturday  last, the 26th inst, a company of Latter-day Saints  left Liverpool, pr Guion S. S. Wyoming. There were  116 from Scandinavia, 24 from England,  6 from Holland, 3 visitors, 9 missionaries from  Scandinavia, and 3 from England, making in  all 161 Souls. They were under the presidency  of Elders Ola Olson 1st, and  C. C. A. Christensen 2nd Counsellor and Secretary.  Julius Johnson,  Edmund Sanderson,  (the last named returning through sickness) from Scan- dinavia and Samuel A Blair,  and Thomas Beard of the British Mission. Bro.  wife and a Mrs. Brown  were the returning visitors. On Thursday evening,  the 24th inst, whilst we were holding a fellow- ship meeting in the prayer room at 42 with the  returning missionaries and some of the Saints,  a number of missionaries arrived per Guion S. S. Arizona. John  Johnson and Orson Merrill  W. B. Gibbons. ENDENTRY for the British John  Schweizer, for the Swiss and German Missions. Those for  E. C. Rich and  Edward Peay to  Orson Merrill  to the Newcastle Conferences. There were also  some visitors wife,  T. Williams, Mrs Jane Ferguson and daughter  Mary and Mrs Morse sister in law to Bro Rd Morse now presideing over the Welsh Mission.  There are some few persons left who wish to  emigrate, but who have not been able to get  ready with our companies; so to prevent anyone  being disappointed we have arranged to  send them on the 16th of November pr Guion  S. S. Nevada. Our Brother McAllister leaves  on Saturday per. Guion S. S. Arizona, and we  are exceedingly sorry to part with him. I wish  he could have finished up the year with us.  Bro L. R. Thomas, who has been assisting  us in the office during the emigration sea- son, will hold the books until the successor  of Bro. McAllister arrives. He should be a good  accountant and business man. Bro Macallister  has been first class help, and he is a gentleman  and Latter-day Saint who appreciates the honor  and privilege of being a citizen of the Kingdom  of God and a standing in the Church of Christ,  which many do not seem to sense, I am sorry to say.  ENDENTRY Brother I wrote  you in my last of the 23rd inst, is still with us.  I have not had any conversations with him  but have let him take his own course. He  has been keeping in the office. He bore a very  good straitforward testimony on Sunday at  our testimony meeting, and seems to feel very  well in the Church. He has made covenant  with the Lord by sacrifice indeed. This is an  evidence to us how capable God is of per- forming His own work and bringing the seed  of Israel into His fold. How many have been led by a scrap of paper into His Church I see  by the papers that our Quorum has been fil- led, which is a satisfaction to me because I  think at the advanced stage of the work  we ought to learn our duty to God and in- quire of Him to know who He wishes to fill  vacancies. I recognize we are the Church  of Christ and the order of that Church.  You are the head of the High Priesthood— the chief apostle of the Church of Christ and  have a right to the revelations of God. We  all sustain you as a prophet, seer and  revelator and ask God to reveal His mind and will unto you that His will may be  done. We all want the will of God done not  ours or anyone elses' but His will. It is His ENDENTRY Church we are members of, He is our Father in  Heaven, our God and Redeemer, all we have  we owe to Him, all we ever expect to enjoy  we look to Him for, and it is natural we  should be jealous for Him, that He may be  sought after, inquired of, honored and  obeyed. He has established His Church and  He is going to extablish His kingdom with  those who love Him and delight to serve  Him, and who are jealous for Him. We have  been a Church long enough to know something  of the order of His appointing and for one  I say let His order be honored and let Him  be inquired of and He will direct. This is just  what we are all praying for that His will  may be done on earth as in heaven I say  Amen with all my heart because this is just  what I truly want to see. It matters little to me  whom the Lord calls, for I am a brother and  friend of every man who is a Latter-day Saint in good standing and full fellowship in  the Church of Christ. There are so many good  and competent men to day who are capable under  the blessing of God of fulfilling any poition to which  they might be called, but they want to be just were the Lord wants them and to do just what He wants  them to do and would not wish for any position  only as they are called by Him, knowing they  are all the same in His sight and their labors of  equal value all working for the same recompense. ENDENTRY of reward viz—Endless lives in His glorious  presence. If it is a strait and narrow way  it is open to all who love God and delight  to keep His commandments; members of  all quorums being equally honorable. For  it is not the position that makes the man,  or ^is^ a sureity of success, but it is the man  of God who is humble, childlike, true and  faithful, enjoying the fellowship of the Holy  Ghost, who makes the position an honor- able one in any quorum or in any position.  The man who honors God is honored by  Him in whatsoever calling or responsi- bility he is called to, Priests of the order  of Aaron often being blessed in a most  miraculous manner on account of their  faith and good works. I am thankful for  the men God has given us to be our com- panions in our Quorum and hope we shall  be one with each other, and as a Quorum,  and with the First Presidency, that we may  be Christs', that we may be sanctified by  the Truth, and he the servants of God in  very deed. May the Holy Ghost be our con- stant companion that we may all see eye  to eye and be a blessing to the House of Israel.  May we be humble and full of love possessing ENDENTRY faith, hope and charity, being temperate in  all things intrusted in our care, working  out our own salvation and laboring with  an eye single to the glory of God. This is my  prayer, and if I had the power to confer  a blessing upon the heads of my fellow ser- vants ^this^ would be the blessing I would confer  upon all, with deepest love and fraternal  affection. God bless the First Presidency and  God bless the Twelve and unite them toge- ther as the heart of one, to bless and be  blessed, and set a righteous example  to all quorums, and to all Israel for  brotherly love, humility, faith, hope  and charity to the glory of God the  Father is the prayer of His unworthy servant.

Dear Brother:  On Saturday last  our Brother McAllister left Liverpool per. Guion  S. S. Arizona. Such sudden changes are never  very pleasant, especially with book keepers. When your telegram reached us we were in the midst  of the business of shipping off a company of  Saints. Bro. Mc Allister has worked assiduously  to get his books posted up and in some shape  to hand over to Brother L. R. Thomas so that he  could hold them and carry on the business  until Bro. McAllisters' successor should be  sent. Bro Mc set up the whole of  Friday night working to have the accounts  in good condition. Bro. Thomas is doing very  well for a young man as you will see from  the Balance Sheets for October. As you will soon  see Bro. Mac he will give you quite a history of  our doings and hand you a very handsome- ly bound large sized Book of Mormon for  the Tabernacle and a Psalmody. We furnish  the unbound copies and Mr Fazackerly binds  them free of charge. They are exceedingly  handsome and will be a pleasant souvenire  ENDENTRY from old 42 Islington and our friend Fazackerly. Your greatly esteemed favors of Oct 19 and 17th  have come safe to hand. The reason why Elder  Turkey was because he  could not get a passport. It is no use anyone  coming here without a passport, for they cannot ob- tain one in this country. Bro. Kelsch tried all he  could and made it a subject of prayer but was  refused and that is why we put him into the field He wrote home to try and get a passport but failed So we have appointed him President of the Bris- tol Conference where he is laboring at present. I have received letters from J. M. Sjodahl and  W. H. Smart wishing to be released from the  Turkish Mission through sickness. Bro. Smart writes that Bro Socander is down  sick also.

Dear Brethren:  On the 6th of April I attended a very good Conference of the Scot- tish Mission. Our priesthood meetings and assembly of the Saints were attended very satisfactory and an excellent spirit prevailed.  Last Sunday I attended the Newcastle Conference and had quite a number of strangers attend. Although but few baptisms the Elders have much joy in their labors.  Last week Elders Fraser, the Young Brothers and others arrived and received their appointments as you will see from the Millennial Star9. On Saturday the 12th inst. Elders W. H.  Smart and Richard Yeates left here for home per S. S. Alaska  Your favor of March 22nd received. I had read in the Deseret News that two dollars was to be al- lowed the passengers from Utah for provisions, and could not understand it, but your letter explains that this two dollars is to help pay provisions on the railroad and incidental expenses." I am afraid this will cause some confusion. If two dollars is to be returned to the ENDENTRY passengers, would it not be easier to charge them $60 sixty dollars and thus save any fur- thur trouble. The presidents of the Companies have much to do already and to have the responsibility of giving every passenger two dollars at New York or a part of two dollars after some necessary expenses have been paid will increase his labors and make him a tar- get for the passengers to accuse and find fault with. I think we should do all we could to prevent confusion and guard against giving room for complaint. I was sorry when I read the notice in the News that two dollars was to be spent in provisions. If it had been sixty dollars for the fare and understood as here- tofore they have to provide themselves provis- ions over the R Road, they do it. But if they know two dollars is to be given them at New York for provisions they will think that is sufficient for the journey and look to the President to provide them. He has had to do this ^for some^ on several occasions in the past and have so reported to this office. We have to deal with a jealous people and it is a thankless position to have to serve them. I have had an experience with them for years and  have not wondered when men apostatised because of the people. The best way to handle them is strait and give them no chance for ENDENTRY LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42, Islington, Liverpool, May 17th, 1890.  sideways text Geo.

With  regard to Thomas Galbraith I am sorry for  him because he has been over come by the  power of the adversary. I am satisfied he  had a desire to serve God. He was going to  work his way to Utah. He never asked me  for any money. When I found he was deter- mined to go I thought the matter over and  talked it over with Bro. McAllister and the brethren here. One morning, before I said  anything to Galbraith, I told the brethren  I had concluded to offer him a loan to  help him across the continent, for I thought  he was honest. He had been told he would  have to meet difficulties, that he was going  to a new country where he was unknown and  he would meet with people who would en- deavor to poison his mind, to discourage him  and lead him out of the Church; but he  was prepared for this he had read a great  deal against the people, but he knew he ENDENTRY sideways text Geo.

President Wilford Woodruff, and Council.  Dear Brethren:  A small company,  the first of the season, left here this morning, per Guion Steam Ship Wisconsin, under the  presidency of Elder Orson H. Worthington, with  Daniel H. Snarr as  his counsellors, and Thos. E. Bassett clerk and  recorder. The following named brethren returning  missionaries, Jenkyn Thomas, E. L. Burgoyne. The company consisted of 43 souls without counting the missionaries. 32 full fares 4  halves 6 between 1 and 5 years and 1 infant = 43 souls 9 missionaries  = 52. 19 were for Nephi  7 for Market Lake Idaho, 3  for Montpellier = 52. As we have received no advices concerning the  fares north of Ogden and South of Spanish Fork,  we have been obliged to guess at it, and have ad- ded the difference we paid last year to the places  north of Ogden and South of Spanish Fork not knowing  what better to do. According to your instructions we  have made out the lists at $45.25/100 fortyfive dollars  and twentyfive cents and opened an account with  ENDENTRY had a work to do, and was willing to devote  himself to the service of the Divine Master, and  prepared for the difficulties and quoting scrip- ture, with which he seemed to be familiar, that  the Saints would have to suffer tribulation. When I spoke to him I told him I thought him an honest man, and had come to the conclu- sion to loan him sufficient to pay his overland  journey personally. I told him I did not know  why I did it, because I had little faith in men, my experience had taught me that there was a great deal of dishonesty in men, and that he  need not thank me, but thank God who had  softened my heart towards him to take a  step I was not in the habit of doing. I told  him the difficulties he would have to meet  with, and that he had to establish a character  amongst a people who would naturally  look upon him with suspicion, because  so many frauds had imposed upon them, that they wanted to know men before  they were willing to invite them into their families. Galbraith heard me lecture to a  Scandinavian Company, who were leaving  here for Zion, telling them in my plain flat- footed way, what they might expect and  the experience they would meet. And he  said to me, no one could misunderstand  that, and he was struck with the disposition  ENDENTRY suspicion or to think they do not receive what they ought to receive and accuse an innocent man who happens to be their servant.  I know you will pardon me for this suggestion.  I only know to honestly give you my views which are the result of my experience and  submit them to your consideration, and then I shall do just as you say. With this company that leaves here on Saturday next, the 19th inst, we shall give the President of the company two dollars for every adult passenger to pay expenses and furnish some provisions. We shall instruct the brethren with him to assist him all in their power. We have done so on previous occa- sions and have received word from the  President of the Company that after they left Liverpool they took no further in- terest than to look after the Saints they were more immediately interested in. It is not all men who are willing to put them- selves out of the way for the convenience  of others. I would suggest that if the pass- engers are to have a rebate of two dollars that it be given them here, on their leav- ing, and so save the President of the Com- pany, who has all he can attend to with- out this extra responsibility. I am sure the ENDENTRY the climate and he wanted to go home. We let him  have the means to go as he was without and has  promised faithfully to send it back to me as soon  as he returns home. The Guion S.S. brings us a few  missionaires and visitors. They landed here this morn- ing. The following are their names and appointments  London Conference  Liverpool,  Samuel Worsencroft, to the  Nottingham  Conference; Jos S. Douglas to the Irish Mission. L  Dahlquist, L. J. Hernstrom, C. Olsen and Joseph  R. Olsen for Wm Langton and  Doug- las Watson, Brother wife and others  whose names I have not yet got. All are in good  health and spirits. They came by the S.S. Wisconsin and  arrived to day. All but the missionaries have left for  their destinations or friends where they are visiting. Bro J. E. Carlisle met with an accident which has  somewhat lamed him. He was jammed between a  tram and cab and bruised considerably. I am happy  to say he has almost recovered. We learn from the papers through their American telegrams that "A consignment of Mormons  landed at New York (14th) yesterday It is believed that these peo- ple are nothing more or less than contract laborers and  it is the intention to raise that point when the next batch of Mormons is landed"—This is going the rounds of the press. We are all well at 42 and join in love. Your brother  Geo. Teasdale. ENDENTRY Mr R. Tenbroeck at these figures and have mail- ed him names and lists of full and half fares so he can have the tickets ready for the company  on their arrival. We cabled you to-day—"Fifty  two sailed send Tenbroeck 1770—" The account figured  at $45.25 for Passengers and missionaries was $1990.04 We sent by Prest Worthington $22000 and cabled you for  1770 00/100 making $1990.04. We also gave the President  of the Company (8600) Eighty six dollars to pay any  necessary expenses and furnish some provisions on  the journey. As an evidence of how this is understood  he asked me if it could be used for provisions for  the returning missionaries, or tipping the saloon  stewards. To handle this emigration business re- quires experience. I do not know how we would  have got along if we had a large company. It took  the brethren all their time to manage this small  company and sit up all night to do it, and they  are good bookkeepers but not used to this busi- ness. With new hands on everything I am getting  an experience in patience. Mr Ramsden is as  kind and considerate as ever. Our returning mis- ionaries all had saloon passage, one of them the odd  one, a cabin to himself. According to your wish we sent  Bros. Bassett, two good missionaries. There  is a call for good help in nearly all the Conferences to  fill the place of those leaving. With kind love to all I remain faithfully yours in the Kingdom of patience  George Teasdale ENDENTRY Scandinavian brethren would have pre- ferred the fare being 6000 or 6100 sixty or  sixty one dollars and all expenses paid and find their own provisions, than the rebate Of course you may have some idea  that assures you of the wisdom of the rebate that I am unacquainted with,  for I do not assume to have much wisdom, I think sometimes I am very dull of comprehension and wish I had  more wisdom and prudence, and could see with clearer judgment. Yet I do the best I can to my poor ability and regret it is so poor.  I am happy to say we use all reasonably well; The last attack I had gave me a severe shaking, but I am getting along wonderfully. We have had of late many evidences of the power and goodness of God in healings and blessings, and glorify His Holy Name. The brethren in the office always desire their kindest re- gards whenever I write. Bro. Thomas is improving in health. Bro Carlisle is taking hold of his labors. Bro Hoge is doing well and  Bro Phillips is a help to me.  With brotherly love I remain as ever yours George Teasdale. ENDENTRY to truthfulness as to the real state of affairs in Utah. Prest Woodruff you know we never offer any in- ducements, outside of the gospel of Christ. We tell the people in Christ they will have peace but in the world tribulation. No Elder ever of- fered any inducement to T. Galbraith to go to Zion  by "false and cruel arguments." He went be- cause he wanted to go, and all the promises  of tribulation, persecution and difficulties, could not deter him from going. He deceived  us all. We all thought him an honest man: he possessed a testimony and enjoyed the  Spirit of God, and God has been his friend  and would have established him in His  righteousness if he had not turned his back  upon Him. Dear Brother Woodruff, there is  nothing I have done I regret in this business  except giving him an introduction to yourself. I humbly ask your pardon for so doing. It  was done in haste without reflection and I  cannot excuse myself. It is the first time I  have been guilty of this unwarrantable  liberty, you may depend upon it being the  last. The suffering I have had in this unfor- tunate experience will certainly be a warning  to me to never repeat it. The loss of the money  advanced him I count a light thing. My suf- fering arises from the knowledge that an act of  ENDENTRY ARRIVALS—On Monday, April 7, 1890, the following named missionaries arrived in Liverpool, in excellent health and spirits, per Inman S.S.

He is growing in- to the knowledge of the gospel, bears his testimony  and is very humble and willing, does not expect  any salary, and willing to go and preach the  gospel. He is astonished at his own conversion,  because he knows it has not been by the power,  logic, or wisdom of man, and is convinced that  the Lord has brought him into His Church and  given him a testimony for some purpose and de- sires to fulfill anything He has for him to do. He has had quite a struggle with opposing in- fluences the pleading of his friends, and the  change from having all the money he wanted  to be without anything. We have not encoura- ged him at all or taken him into our con- fidence. We gave him 20/- to go home as he  had been here some time and was feeling ra- ther blue and I thought if he had the means  he would return, that perhaps he was to proud  to ask his father after he had been so treated by  him. But he did not go, and afterwards I learn- ed his sister had sent him word, she presumed  he was cured of his folly by now, having found  us out, and discovered what kind of people we were,  and if he wished to return she would send him what money he wanted. He has been quite a help to us since  Bro. Brookbank has been sick. But if you would ra- ther that he should not work here, that is enough he will  leave.

Elder Woodruff,  Dear Bro: On account of my absence  from I only received your letter of the 31st  July at this place the day before yesterday. I am exceedingly thankful for the general information your letters contain and am indeed grate- -ful for the better prospects of harvest announced in your last. I have remained here for the last month expressly to get Elder Prophet. He is so buisy that it has been with difficulty that he has been able to bring his mind to the task and remain at  it. I am, however, extremely satisfied with the prospects of accomplishing the work. He thinks Dan Jones' statement of the dreams ought to be considerableed reliable. From many conversations I have had with Bro. Markham in relation to the subject I have formed the opinion that his memory is so treacherous that he would unwittingly mix other circumstances with those attending Joseph's ass- assination. His statements would therefore require criticism Elder Taylor is bothered for dates of days and hours.  Since I wrote you I have visited  your native State an account of which the boys will find in the Mormon. I am greatly obliged to Bro. Bullock and the clerks in the office for keeping me posted on the affairs at home and thank you kindly for the attention to my fruit trees.  I expect to go to St. Louis just as soon as Elder Taylor finishes his narrative of the conversation between the Governor and the Prophet, andce.  I preached last Sunday here and according to the announcement of the brethren in to-day's Herald I am to lecture this evening on "Utah and the present position of the Mormons."  Heywood has returned to Washington and has better prospects of winding up his business affairs and hopes to ENDENTRY return to Appleby is attending a "Wood's Meeting" to-day in Taylor is at this moment going a head with the Governor's conversation  The political atmosphere is as usual cloudy and betokens storms. The spirit of dis-union is rampant and "Bleeding Kansas" is the principal capital for the Republican party: and a battle has to be fought every week to keep up the exite- ment.  Neither Elder Taylor or myself has received any letters from our families by the August mail  I think you will find Elr. Taylor's account of Governor Ford's conversation with Joseph a splendid affair.

Elder James Johnson, of the Sugar House Ward, who had been visiting his friends, and obtaining some genealogy, returned with this Company.

This reduced the numbers as follows 5 Missionaries 108 emigrants 73 full and 15 half fares including missionaries We shall not send any more companies until August 2nd when another company of British Saints will sail per Guion S.

Carlisle on the "Millennial ENDENTRY Star." Bro. London with Dr H. J. Richards and family, Bro. Phillips has been assisting on the Star but he has left for Bear Lake Stake where he expects to make his home. Brother Joseph Whiteley, the convert from the Church of England has also left this country to make a home amongst the Saints. We have had a visit from several of the excursionists. Bro. Ellerbeck, wife and daughter, Philip Pugsley, wife and daughter Wm Fuller wife and daughter, Chas. G. Shill, Mrs S. Teasdel and son and others. These excursionists do a great deal of good. Sisters Thomas came over to meet their husbands who were returning home from their missionary labors, and they visited with their husbands relatives and friends; also Sisters Morris, McGhie and others have represented the Saints in Utah with much good effect. R. F. Neslen also did much good amongst the Saints. His trip did him much good temporaly, I should say physically, for his health improved very much, and also spiritually. I hope it will continue with him. I am pleased with the good reports received from the Presidents of Companies and the good work accom plished by our brethren at New York.

I must say it was a surprise to me as I was not look- ing for it until the fall at the end of the Emigration season. But I am a minute man and go and come at the call of my file leaders, for I have but one desire in life and that is to be where my heavenly Father wishes me to be. This mission has been a blessing to me and I am thankful to Him for the experience. Last Sunday I attended a very good Conference and Priesthood meet- ings at Birmingham, and on Sunday week we have a Conference of the Welsh Mission. I have received a letter from Bro. J. Jack about an extra charge being made in the fare from Copenhagen. I have sent the letter to Prest Fjeldsted for explanations. There are always two sides, and frequently much mis- representations, that it is always better to hear both sides before judging. I am thankful ENDENTRY to say my health is good and I am en- joying my mission. I preached the gospel yesterday to a gentleman who was here in this room for two hours and three quarters. When I return from Cheltenham I will write you again, as I am a little hurried this morning to take the noon train. I have been so busy since receiving your letter I have had no time to think. So you will kindly excuse this hasty epistle and rest assured I shall have pleasure in carrying out your councils to the best of my poor endeavor.

Beloved Brethren:  Yesterday I had to cable you for ten hundred pounds in conse- quence of the heavy drafts made upon us and a mistake in not drawing sufficient upon you for the fourth Company. I was afraid we would not have sufficient to pay Guion and Co for the sea passage of the June 28th Company and drafts were continually being presented and the money wanted and our emigration being at a stand still until the 2nd of August I saw we were going to be bankrupt, and so cabled for ten hundred, owed us by the office, to save us. Mssrs Guion and Co have just informed us that the New York yesterday morning—the 19th—at 5 a.m. and that they left at 3 p.m. the same afternoon. We are rejoicing in the blessing of God attending our companies. In conversation with Mr. Ramsden I told him I did not know but what we would have to quit sending companies. He asked why? do not they go through all right? I replied yes but there is so much prejudice against us and the people of the States so stirred up by ENDENTRY as I had not thought of such a thing. Brother  Stauffer is quietly doing as well as any miss- ionary who ever went to Turkey. I have for- warded him your letter, with a letter from  myself and enclosed a five pound note  to assist him in expenses. In this weeks "Star"  which will be issued next Monday there is an inter- esting letter from him under date of May 17th. It  bears postmark of a later date and would have  been published earlier but I have been away at tending conferences and visiting. Bro. J. E. Carlisle  is away with br. Heber J. Richards and family visiting  London. Bro. Phillips is assisting me on the "Star"  He leaves on the 28th of June for Bear Lake.  He has been quite a help to me in the editorial  department. He has an excellent education  and is a gentleman, but I think rather a fiery temper when crossed. His expressions have  to be toned down, andbut with me he has been  as humble as a child, and treated me with  a great deal of respect. I am sorry to lose  him, and he expresses sorrow to leave. But the  way has opened up for his emigration and  I would not detane him. If he continues in  the love of the gospel and true humility he will  be a great blessing to himself, and likely others.

You referred to Prest J. U. Stucki being released if we  had any one to succeed him. There is only Brother ENDENTRY the newspapers against our emigration. He smiled "oh never mind that" he said "when you cannot send companies then we will have to try some other way."—"You do not send emigrants in violation of law," no paupers—no contract la- borers—do you? he said—"No" I replied. He then told me of an interview he once had with the American Consul in Liverpool when Enarts tried to stop the emigration and the Consul asked him if the "Mormons" were of the above class andc. He is cheerful and sanguine, has good faith our people will go through all right so long as they honor the laws. This we propose to do by the grace of God and continue to trust in Him. It is His work and He will over- rule all things to suit His glorious will. My only anxiety is that His will may be done and His puposes fulfilled. I think we are safe if we do His will and keep His commandments. I believe in His promise—"If you love me and keep my commandments you shall prosper in the land" ##2 Nephi 4:4##—Every Latter-day Saints knows this to be true and they are full of thankfulness, light and truth.

Bro Stucki spoke of a brother residing at  Elsinore who was very capable. His name is  Richard Haag. He also said he could use  twelve good missionaries in the Swiss and Ger- man mission if he had them. There has been  a revival in that mission where good competent  Elders are. We all want good competent Elders; like  everything else there is always room at the top. The  Elders generally ^when they arrive here^ do not know much about the  principles themselves, and by the time they learn  to teach others, and are useful in the ministry,  it is time for them to go home; especially is this so  where they have to learn the language. If it meets  your approbation Prest Stucki will leave for home  with the next company from the Swiss and  German mission, and Bro. Brandley will be ap- pointed to succeed him. Elder C. D. Fjeldsted ar- rived here November 13th 1886 and Elder Jas. Leaing  October 13th, 1886. Will you kindly inform me if  you think they should return home. They are  bootth very excellent missionaries and of course  we hate to part with them, and they are willing to  stay until it is deemed wisdom for them to re- turn. I would like your council on the matter  that I may be satisfied.

Beloved Brethren:  I have the honor of submitting to you, by this mail, our month- ly statement, for the past month, July.  Since receiving your esteemed favor of June 27, and later communications, we have endeavored to fulfil your expressed wish, to arrange the affairs of the mission, so that when our successor arrived, we could turn over the bu- siness of the mission to him, and make all the necessary explanations concerning its details andc. This will account for our dis- bursements being rather heavy during the last month. We paid Fazakerleys bookbinding bill of £96.12.0, our takxes £9.15.4, House cleaning Whitewashing andc £4.3.5, Gasbill £2.6.4, Coal £2.10.6 and so forth. We shall do our best to have every- thing in good shape to turn over to our suc- cessor, all bills paid, and the house clean and comfortable. We were very much pleased with your reconsideration of the brother who should succeed me, and acknowledge the hand of God in it. I am thankful for the kindly consider- ation you have had for me, and very much  ENDENTRY appreciate your friendship and brotherly love. I am very thankful to God for His sustaining grace. Notwithstanding all the anxieties, cares and tribulations, I have enjoyed the experience of this mission exceedingly, and what little good may have been done, to God be the glory.  We have sought His counsel and He has guided. The broadcast distribution of tracts and prin ted matter will be like the "bread cast upon the waters," already do we hear of a spirit of inquiry being madenifest. I have good faith in printers ink. The Lord is doing His own work, and it is not by wisdom of man, but by His Spirit is He accomplishing His mighty purposes. It is a great pity there are so few who believe God.

On Wednesday I returned to the office and met Elders J. B. Fairbanks en route to James J. W. Duncan who arrived in Liverpool on Saturday night the 12th inst per Guion S. S. Nevada.

We have to give the brethren in charge all instructions, as it is a new business, or experience, to them. People who are engaged in a business, that time and experience have made them proficient in, are apt to forget there was a time when they were ignorant of it, and think all men should have the knowledge they themselves possess. As a general rule we know the Presidents are ignor- ant of what is required of them in taking a com- pany of emigrants through to Utah, and are careful ENDENTRY to give them all necessary information, as theirs is a labor of love, and we are anxious for the Saints to go in peace and safety. If we fail it is because we may be too confident in the ability of the President, and think he knows more than he really does. Elders Joseph Shipley arrived here on Thursday last, the 31st ult. I was hoping you would have sent us more help. 12 missionaries who came in 1889 and 1890 for the British Mission have returned through ill health, or other causes, who should be useful in this mission to-day, and who were calculated upon, so we are short that number now. Then we have some ten elders who came in 1888 who expect to be released this fall. We have only 8 Elders in Wales now, we had twenty at one time, and should have 16 or 18 at least if that mission is to be kept up. We have only 4 Elders in Ireland, we should have 6 or 7. We have only 9 Elders in Scotland we should have 11 or 12 at least. So we will want 3 for Scotland 3 for Ireland 8  for Wales and 10 for England as soon as we can have them. We are all well at 42.

Beloved Brethren:  Since last writing to you I have attended Conferences of the Welsh and Scottish Missions. We had excellent meet- ings which were well attended, but the reports were not very encouraging with regard to bap- tisms. In the Welsh Mission they had not baptized one in six months, but in Scotland two baptisms were reported, for the six months, and six baptisms in July, since the 30th of June. In the six months 15,531 tracts had been distributed, 26 of the cheap edition of the Voice of Warning. In the Scottish Mission 13,265 tracts had been distributed by the Glasgow Tract Society, in six months, and 14,619 by the Elders andc in their districts for three months report, making a total of 27,884 tracts distributed, 11 Books of Mormon sold, 5 loaned, 13 Voice of Warning sold, 8 loaned, 5 given away by the Elders, to friends or acquaintance. There is a seem ing indifference amongst the people generally, or if convinced lack the moral courage to obey; Yet the Elders are in no wise discouraged, they feel well, and we hade most excellent meetings. The and ^elders^ are filled with praise and thanksgiving. There seems to be a deep rooted prejudice against ENDENTRY us, and frequently the Elders are insulted, the people re- fusing to receive the tracts, or hold any conversation with them. The Protestants and Catholics are holding "Demonstrations" in the open air, and in the largest halls. Last Sunday on Glasgow Green there was a protes- tant demonstration, and they had to be protected by squads of policeman, which we saw march down to the foot of the Nelson Monument, on Glasgow Green. We live in a momentous age.  Your favor of June 30 reached us after Elder Jas. R. Smith had returned, through sickness and family affairs, he left here per S. S.

In connection with the Pioneer Company we have organized all in your place and vicinity who wish to join the emigration, into companies of Tens, fifties,  and hundreds, in two divisions, with a President ENDENTRY and two Councillors to each division, with the sanction of their respective companies, and having called the Presidents, Councillors, and Captains of hundreds to- gether, have advised with them and decided that all the High Council that is necessary to be left at Winter Quarters, after the present High Council shall have left, will be the Presidents and Captains of Emigration Companies.  And where the present Pres- idents of Divisions and Captains shall remove they will leave others similarly organized with the approval of the brethren, or those who thus enter into the organiza- tion.  The brethren now organized, have heard the Word and the Will of the Lord on which this organ- ization is founded and have given their hearty assent unto it, and any hesitancy in carrying out their pledges or acting in Concert with their Presidency, as they well know will be at the loss of a glory that they ^can^ never regain,  therefore, we say that that these instructions generally are more especially to such as shall hereafter arrive at  your place; so that they may receive the principles and instructions that those have had, who have been with  us the past winter.  The business of the Saints at Winter Quarters from this time is to journey West, until further instructions: and while some will have the means to  go forward at the springing of grass, others will have  to stop and raise grain to carry with them: and while some will come here prepared, others will have stop and prepare for their journey: and in either case,  all preparation and organization is for journeying and not for a permanent location at Winter Quarters, and  if any refractory members should make their appear- ENDENTRY ance, the Bishops will see that justice is done them,  and let no iniquity have place in your midst.  It is the privilege of the brethren who remain, or arrive hereafter, to decide, but the Council urgently recommends to them to remove the lesser houses on to the line, of Winter Quarters, or on the borders of the most populated blocks, so as to defend themselves, by houses, pickets, ditches, andc against the Indians, so that your women and children may not be insulted and abused, and their tables robbed, while they are draw- ing water, or gathering the fruits of their gardens or attending to any domestic duties, in your absence.  Let the brethren labor unitedly in making fields, fencing, planting, harvesting andc all under the di- rection of their respective captains of Tens and Fifties, - over whom will be the supervision of their Captains of hundreds and Presidents who will allot to each family all the ground they need or can till, for a garden, in the City of Winter Quarters or its immediate vicinity— so that all may share equally in the comforts and  luxuries of the table.  The Idler shall not eat the bread of the laborer, therefore let a record be kept, by the  Captains of each Ten, or his clerk, how each man em- ploys his time, from day to day; and let the same be reported weekly to the Clerk of the division or Presi- dency of the organization; and let one tenth of the avails of each man's labor be appropriated for the benefit of the poor and sick, under the direction of the Bishops, attending to the Council of the Presidency; for the poor ye have always with you, and the sick often: and he who administers to them, serveth the Lord.  Your crops, and cattle will be exposed ENDENTRY to the aggression of the Omahaws, and other Indians, and we say to you take care of them, learn to watch as well as pray, for the farther you go West, the more  you will be exposed and if the Saints cannot watch them safely here here, what will they do when they  get where civilzation or half civilization is unknown.  Make good fences around your corn fields, and locate families near sufficient to watch and keep them safe,  and let the emigrants be diligent and careful to plow,  plant, and fence all they possibly can before they start on their journey.  We advise the brethren to keep the up the a police of their most effective men at Winter Quarters as we have done for  th in an hour ye know think not, evil may be upon you; and pray them for their services so that they will not be obliged to neglect your safety, for a loaf of bread, to satisfy their hunger or that of their families.  It is highly important in this dispensation that every brother learns his duty,  and acts accordingly: in doing which, every one who can, will pay their herdsmen in money, flour, grain,  andc as they shall need, for their comfort, or to prosecute their journey, and not complete compel them to urge payment of the Sisters whose husbands are in the  army, the Widows, and poor, and let the herdsmen be diligent in striving to deliver all the cattle andc entrust- ed to their charge, at the proper time, to those who are emigrating West, and such of those, as cannot pay down, agree upon the Cattle you shall mark as your own to be held in society, to be paid for or delivered to you at a future day. ENDENTRY It is our wish and Council that the Em- igration company now formed, shall follow the Pioneers, as soon as the grass is sufficient to support the teams, and the Presidents, and Captains will examine and know that every soul that goes in said Com- pany is provided with from 3 to 500 lbs of bread stuff,  or a year and a halfs, and as much more as he can get for we know not whether we can raise corn this summer, as we anticipate at the place of location.  Let the first Emigration company take with them as many of the Sisters whose husbands are in the Army, as can fit themselves out, or can be conveniently fitted out.  It is wisdom that all the men in the Emigration Company shall be organized into a mili- tary body, under their respective Captains of 10s, 50s, and 100s with Charles C. Rich as their Commander in Chief who will see that every man is properly armed, and ready to meet any savage encounter at a moment's warning, taking care that caps and priming of all firelocks are so secured as to admit of no acci- dents: that John Scot superintend the artillery un- der C. C. Rich—Horace S. Eldredge be marshal— Hosea Stout Captain of the Guard on the journey and that the guard watch during the night, and sleep as they have during the day:  The first company will carry the Temple bell, with fixtures for hanging at a moment's notice, which will be rung at daylight, or a proper time, and call all who are able to arise to prayers, after which ringing of bell and breakfast, or ringing of bell and departure in 15 minutes to secure the cool of the day till breakfast time andc as the bell may ENDENTRY be needed, particularly in the night Seasons, if Indians are hovering round to let them know you are at your duty, and if any man acts disorderly, punish him severely.  Whenever a Company of 75 men, who do not belong to the present organized Company, shall be organized so as to carry out the principles of the Word and Will of the Lord and these instructions, according to the Pattern, with or without families, and provisions enough to sustain each soul 18 months, they may come on till the 1st of July, but in all cases, the brethren must run their own risk for food and not depend on the pioneers, or any Company in advance for support in the least, either for their teams, themselves, or families, for we are credibly informed that more than 30 souls of the Oregon Emigrants, perished in the Mountains with hunger the last season; and 100 bushels of corn can easier bye raised near Winter Quarters, than the 50 bushels at the foot of the Mountains.  If a man of the 1st Emigration com- pany, who is going to stop at your place for the time being, should so far forget his Covenant in the Temple, and his more recent obligations and agree- ments as to retain his wagon or team, from the neces- sities of the journey: it will be the duty of the Presi- dents to instruct the captains to take the same and apply it where necessity requires, and thus compel the owner to do what he had previously agreed to, for as some were compelled to come in, in Ancient days, others must be compelled to remain in, ^in^ latter days, and men who are taken at their word have no reason to find fault.

I have but my family with me and they are astound- ed at the great city of London, Prest. Teasdale is expediting busi- ness and expects to sail near the first to fourth of October.  Taking leave of the saints is very affecting, it seems like pulling up home stackes and the saints feel it too. I trust the few who belong to the Church will try and reconcile them- selves to the change which has taken place.  P.S. Any counsel or directions you have for me will be thankfully received.

Kempe, return- ing missionaries', the first named through ill health There are 134 souls in the company, 67 full, and  25 half fares. Included in this number are  two sisters, visitors, who have been visiting their  friends in Scotland, Sisters Janet Morris, and Dick. They are in excellent health and spirits, and  truly faithful Latter-day Saints. Sister Clara  Johnson, and her two boys, returning from a  visit to friends; and a good sister, Mary A Chambers, leaving all her family and going  alone to Zion, to spend her days with the Saints  of God. All the others are from Scandinavia. They appear to be a very fine class of our people. I met with them on Wednesday eve- ning last, and I enjoyed much freedom  in speaking to them. The president, Bro Ostlund, says, he has had no trouble with them at all in  ENDENTRY crossing the sea. They are willing and obedient,  full of hope. Our good friend Mr Ramsden gave  the Elders two state rooms, worth at this sea- son of the year £45.0.0 a room, had refused passengers. The saloon and intermediate was  full but our people had the best rooms in  the ship. He kindly sent me word ^that^ on wWednesday ^that^ our company, pr. Leonard  I. Jordan, arrived in New York at 7 a.m. and  left at 3 p.m., which intelligence was gratefully  received, and we praised God in His holiness. Truly  has He blessed us, and holds us in His protect- ing care. We are surrounded with wickedness. The Guion Co. is having a good season, I am happy  to say. They bless us and the Lord is blessing them. Every berth in the next two ships are engaged. So  you see it does not militate against them carrying the "Mormon" emigration.

Brother Young re- mained until to-day when he left to attend the  Norwich Conference and his family returned  to Liverpool. With this company we shall close  up our seasons business, so far as I am concern ed. We have advertised, to send all, who have  not been prepared to go in the September  companies, that a company will leave ^here Oct 11th^ from  any part of the European Mission and we  have already a good many names. But  we shall now take stock and turn over  the business in a proper manner and send  you a balance sheet with the September  Report, which will close my labors in  the Presidency of the British Mission. We were  informed by the Guion Co. who received their  report from New York that Bro.

We have taken stock closed up the  accounts and have had everything audited and  send you the statement thereof for your inspection.  There will be bills not paid from £75 to £80 pounds  which should be deducted from the Profits and  then we have carried some accounts that have been  reported year after year as assets to "Doubtful accounts"  and charged Profit and loss which will here after put  the business in better shape. I cannot but regret that  it should have been considered essential to remove  me from the Presidency of the European Mission until  the seasons business was completed and everything  closed up in a business like manner; but I presume  my labors are required somewhere else and so hav- ing turned over everything to my fellow laborer Apostle B.

I trust you will not consider it presumptous in me to address you on a subject which I believe to be necessary and a duty.  During the time I have been laboring here in the Liverpool Office I have observed with anxiety the failing health of our much beloved President, George Teasdale, and have carefully and prayerfully arrived at the conclusion that to withhold the facts in the case longer from you would be dereliction of duty on my part as a servant of God.  Pres. Teasdale had a very severe attack of sickness in February and I do not think that he has fully recovered from the effects of it, and with the care and responsibility incident to his position as President of the European Mission, his health seems to be gradually but surely getting worse.  Of late his affairs at home seem to give him a good deal of anxiety. He feels the loss of Bro. Picton very much, and I understnad that since Bro. Picton's death, Pres. Teasdale's affairs at home are not in a satisfactory condition. The strain upon his mind, under his present bodily condition, seems to be too great and ENDENTRY I fear the consequences should he have to continue a great while longer without a change or the rest which he so much needs. I have not arrived at this conclusion merely from my own observations, but the same opinion prevails with all the brethren whom I have conversed with on the subject and also Sister Teasdale. Dr. Phillips, who has been prescribing for and attending to Pres. Teasdale during his sickness, has kindly, at my request, written his opinion in regard to Pres. Teasdale's condition, and I enclose it with this communication.  I have carefully avoided letting Bro. Teasdale know about this letter for fear he might object to it's being sent, and thus withhold the facts in the case from you, that I consider you should be made acquainted with, preferring, like a true and faithful servant of God, anything rather than shrink from his duty.  Hoping you will kindly forgive me for addressing you in this manner, which nothing but a sense of duty would have prompted me to, and ever praying for the blessings of our Heavenly Father to rest upon you and all the faithful I remain  Your humble brother in the cause of Christ Walter Hoge  sideways text Walter Hoge 14 June, 1890 Recd July 1 end of sideways text ENDENTRY LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42 Islington, Liverpool, Oct. 15th 1890  Prest Wilford Woodruff Dr Br:  We are busy closing up emigration a/e for this year. Tho' we were all inex- perienced who were left in this office, business went smoothly on.  Requested you to meet all the Railway fares from your office, for I found that many drafts had been sent to Cover expence of emigrants and we received but little money from them.

See Bro. Fieldsted concerning efficiency of scan- dinavian elders; his views suit our condition well.  If my son Albert would round up his shoulders he ought to ^be^ called on a mission. My son BS could be very useful to me and we need some one to begin to pick up a knowledge of the clerical business of this office in view of Bro.

This country does not agree with him, but he is uncomplaining and strickly business, and has proved himself an active elder in the field. We releive him of the presidency of the L.pool Conference, calling him to labor in this office.  Some of the elders and many of the saints are much exercised over your manifesto, but more, I think, in giving a sort of credence to the lying reports which are flooding the country concerning what was done at your late conference. My testimony is, that all your acts are in perfect harmony with the revelations of God and I have talked and written, I believe, effectually on this subject. Astonishing how the world mourns over what they they are pleased to call a surrendering of principles on our part.  Love to Prests.

Dear Brother:  I find it has cost me about one hundred and fifty dollars perhaps a triffle more to live while I have been waiting for possession of 42. Bro. Teasdale proffered to vacate and let me in to which I did not object, but he did not do it. I arrived on the 3rd day of Sept. and Bro. T. moved out on the 4th of Oct I was actually five weeks getting into 42. I cannot let this amount appear against me. I have enumerated most of the expense of sleep- ing and eating, but not all. Now if you choose to meet this extra expense by approprating and sending a draft all right; otherwise I will forward an order on Rossiter to pay you there—which can be credited to this office—one hundred and fifty dollars. The table expenses, generally, would have meet this amount, during Bro. T's time, and I really think he should have had the extra expense to meet not I. But do what you think is right bethren and shall be satisfied. I await your answer to all my Communications.

Islington, Liverpool, Sept. 23rd 1890  Prest Woodruff S. L. C. Utah Dear Brother:  London and Lowestoft and attendance at the Conferences have been pleasant and the Lord is merciful unto us in this Country. At our London Conference it ^is^ said that Jarman mustered his forces just below our hall but did not interefere with our comfort.  The conference at Lowestoft was unusually well attended I am informed, and there were about forty people present. One gentle- man who is investigating the principles of the Gospel came to me after the evening meeting and thanked me for the information he had gained. Our affairs are at a low ebb, no persecution, but an indifference, hard to cope with, seems to have settled upon the people. Lies are flying about and the most insideous come from our own mountain home. Apostates write that, the Govt. has  stopped polygamy but the elders are living openly with young girls marriage or no marriage. I am forcebly impressed with the idea that if an effort were made among the people, instructions sent to the presidents of stakes and ^were to^ they operate with the Bishops Teachers etc energetically, to have the people write to their friends throughout the British mission that good would be accomplished. The people are indiffer- ent in this land but they have an excellent example set them by their friends in Zion. I am satisfied that, quite a commotion would be made among those who have known us long if they could have faithful testimonies from their absent friends. The Lord knows we need help from every good scource. ENDENTRY LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42. Islington, Liverpool,  189  Don't think me presumptious, brethren, in offering this suggestion, but ^I^ have felt, quite strongly that it was the begening of the finish of this mission, of course I am anxious to have it last but I dont ^beleive^ God will endure perfect indifference ^on the part of the people^ for any great length of time. It seems to me there are thous- ands of people here who must receive the Gospel, good honest souls blinded by the craftiness of men, and my mind is already full of anxiety to know how to teach them. God help His elders, no human power can break the spell which evil has wrought upon the minds of the people.  The greater part of the experienced elders of the mission will soon be released to return home. I feel that we must pray and work harder—more hours—to fill the vacancy which will be felt throughout the entire mission.  It will be pretty hard upon the president of the mission ^to do^ but it seems actually necessary that he should attend every conference. So much needed instructions to the elders. They drop into curious nooks and corners and run in others ruts without giving the subject thought or due Consederation; and the presthood meetings at these times as the most im- portant of all.

We are at our camp at this time about two hundred souls. All enjoying good health and a plenty of work We work all together as one family and live as near a like as we can. We are building a dining room and are calculating to all eat at the same table like they do at Orderville.

Brethren  you can see that my intention is good  and I hope this will meet your  minds. I will forward the list I make up from the reports, to you soon as possible. True we need men who will  strike out into new fields, we ^have^ a very few in  the mission who are determined to plow  in old fields, and there are no saints to  saupport that class. In some conferences I find  that retaining drunken people in the church  has, in one instance driven out a fairly good  man and is baring respectable people who are  favorably impressed with ^ the^ doctrines. When all means  are exhausted and they persist in their drunkeness  I have advised their being cut off. I find respecta- ble people in every Conference who are enquiring  into the gospel. Just sunday in stockton on Tees strangers  came in the evening ^to our meeting^ and one young man ^was heard to^ remarked as he went out the door at the close, "I could sit and listen  all night to such talk as that,"—the first principles of the  Gospel.

Kilpat- rick—^this morning^ apologising for his "anti Mormon humour," "I mean no  offense." He proffers to publish any corrections I wish to  make in his report of our Conversation.  I found the brethren in scotland anxiously looking  to L.pool for more elders. The eight ^elders^ that came were not  half enough for scotland alone, and I could spare  them not one. They want thirty to fifty efficient elders.  Openings are being made that must be improved, and  we see them languish for the want of help. Most of  the Conferences I have attended need assistance, elders  who can help themselves and their families not feel  distressed. Many of the brethren have said to me, there  are plenty of Young ^men at home^ in our neighbourhood, who ought to  Come out into the world on missions, and some have  stated that, these efficient Young men were kept at  home by the ward authorities. I am aware that many  ENDENTRY remained at home to vote, but the enemy is fast re- leasing them and perhaps we can soon turn all of ^our^  attention to preaching the gospel. I have asked the  brethren for lists of names and will send them to you; do not think me too officious in this act, the anxiety  in me may plead for me.  Good tourists have done a wonderful amount of  good, and this class hunt up relatives and introduce  the elders into places and families, not reached heretofore.  Circumstances make it necessary to release Bro Jenk- ins from the scotish mission. Bro Brough is also released,  this leaves but nine elders there. It seems to me that  all the elders are going one way. Have some one advise  me of elders being called and when they will leave. A few  lines will post me.  Where it is possible I have not suffered lies in the  news papers to go unchalenged. Bro Carlisle and I  are now acquainted with parties' connected with the  leading papers here and ^also with^ Mr. Shearman American Con- sul and proffered ^to them^ information concerning our affairs  that they need go astray no more. I am sending the star to these men and places, and have proffered to give them  books if they will read them. Public libraries ought  to be supplied, especially reading rooms so far as we  can consistently, but I leave this to your direction.
