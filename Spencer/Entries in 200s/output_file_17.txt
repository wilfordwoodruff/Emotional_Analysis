 -[COPY.]-OGDEN, Dec. 23rd 1891.To whom it may concern:At a meeting of the High Council of Weber Stake, held December 1st. 1891, in the matter of Job Pingree againstNathan Tanner Jr., it was decided that the charges against Brother Tanner were not sustained.ALF. W. MILLGATE,Clerk of the Council.-[COPY.]-SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, MAY 28th, 1892.To the Presidency and High Councilof the Weber Stake of Zion:Dear Brethren:There have been cases tried before your body in which Nathan Tanner, Jr., has been a party. He has beendissatisfied with the decisions rendered, and has taken an appeal to us, as the first presidency of the Church. Theevidence in the cases has been furnished by Brother A. W. Millgate your clerk.We have carefully gone through all that has been submitted to us, and not entirely satisfied with the writtenevidence, we took the liberty of sending for President L. W. Shurtliff, to obtain information from him upon pointswhich were not clear to us in the evidence submitted. After hearing from him such explanations as he could furnish,in addition to the written evidence, we have decided:First—That instead of the Presidency of the stake and the High Council acting upon the appeal which BrotherNathan Tanner, Jr[.], made to them from the decision of Bishop McQuarrie and Councilors upon the case decidedby them July 22nd, 1891, by referring it back without hearing to the Bishop's court, to be there further disposedof, they should have entertained the appeal of Brother Nathan Tanner, and acted upon it.It appears clear from the evidence, so far as we can understand it, that Brother Tanner had a well groundedcomplaint, in that he had a decision rendered against him without the formality of a hearing, and without having anyopportunity to make a defense or justification or explanation of his conduct.It appears from the record that Brother Tanner had brought to the attention of the Bishop and his councilorsthe ill-treatment which he alleges he had received from Brother Job Pingree; and thought he did not make a formalcharge, it was somewhat in the nature of a charge, and was construed as a complaint against Brother Pingree.The record as submitted to us, does not contain the proceeding which took place before the Bishop's court. But we have the decision, and in that decision Brother Tanner is condemnedWhile there may have been sufficient grounds for this decision against Brother Tanner, we think that BrotherTanner has reason for feeling dissatisfied therewith, because he was not present at the trial of the case, and did nothave an opportunity to defend himself, or to make an explanation.In expressing our judgemnt upon this point, we do not pronounce upon the merits, or demerits of the case, butof the irregularity of the proceedings before the Bishop's court. We think that no man's case should be tried withouthis having the fullest opportunity to defend himself; neither should judgment be pronounced against him, as in thiscase, without his having an opportunity to be heard and make an explanation.Second,—In a trial before you on [blank] a resolution was adopted by the High Council requir-ing Brother Tanner to recall the charges he had made, and apologise to Brother Pingree. In pursuance of that resolu-tion, the minutes state that Brother Tanner said he thought he had done so. "He had intended to do so to meet theresolution." He then said "I now here unqualifiedly recall every word that I have said with regard to that subject,and will now say that I regret that I ever used it. I regret that any reference was made to the subject here in thiscase, and I ask Brother Pingree's forgiveness[.]" The minutes futher state that at the conclusion of Brother Tanner's retraction, President Shurtliff asked Brother Pingree if that was satisfactory, and Brother Pingree answered in thenegative. One of the councilors also said that it was not satisfactory to him.Of course, we can only judge by the minutes that are before us, but upon reading these words of Brother N.Tanner, Jr., it has seemed to us that Brother Pingree should have been satisfied with that which he said, and notpushed the matter any further. He had unqualifiedly recalled every word he had said, he had regretted the referencethat had been made to the subject, and he had asked forgiveness. Our judgment is that, that request of his shouldhave been granted, and it should have been accepted as satisfactory, under the circumstances.Third—Brother Tanner appeals against the decision of the Presidency and Council that he should go before theward and make acknowledgment before the ward, and also before his quorum, for the things he has said in this casethat have been signified by the Council as improperBrother Tanner in his appeal assigns as reasons for not complying with this, and appealing from the decision:First.—Because he does not feel that an apology is due.Second.—Because, if due at all, in his opinion the proper place would be before the council or the bishop and hiscounselors, that being the place where the statements were made.If it be true that the statements which were objected to were made before the council or the bishop and hiscounselors, and not in public, then it appears clear to us that he should not be required to go before the public in theward and make acknowledgments, but that his acknowledgment should be confined to the place where the statementscomplained of were made, and to those who heard him in that place. Of this, we are not in a position to decide, be-cause we do not know whether his statement is sustained by evidence that he was only before the council whenhe made these allegations. But the last paragraphs in Section 42 of the Book of Doctrine and Covenents makevery clear the point that a confession of wrong doing shall be confined to those who have heard or witnessed the wrongdoing, and shall not be made more public than this.Now after thus deciding upon these points that have been submitted to us, it is clear to our minds that bothBrothers Tanner and Pingree ought, in the most humble manner, to confess the wrongs that each has done, not only toeach other, but to the Church, and to the quorum to which they belong, and show by their humility that they are sorryfor the scandal which their conduct has created in the midst of the saints. We say this without entering into any ar-gument concerning the right or wrong of either party. It is very evident that a bad spirit has been engendered, andthe saints have had their feelings hurt. Even at this distance from the scene we have been made to painfully feel thatthese brethren in their disputes were bringing discredit to the cause of Christ. One may say that the other was theorigin or cause of all this, and that he was provoked to say and do certain things, because of the words or actions ofthe other. But even if this be true, it is not a sufficient justification for all that has been said and done in this disputeor difficulty between these brethren. They both should humble themselves before the Lord, and obtain his forgiveness,and endeavor to remove whatever bad impression their words or acts may have made upon their brethren and sistersin the Church.With kindest regards, we remain, your Brethren,W.

We donot find much to cheer us—aside from preforming our duty except what comes from Utah, for in Utah is all we hold dearon earth; her associations are dear to our hearts. We feel to rejoicewhen we hear of her prosperity but sad when we here of her calamitiesOur conference of foreign Elders commenced on the 6th inst.and held four days, after which the Brethren again seperated andwent to their respected fields of labor. My field for the next sixmonths is on this Island (Lanai) to preside over the Saints whohave gathered to this place. A good feeling attended our confe-rence—all was peace and harmony, each one appeared to beedified and strengthened, and to feel determined to use every exertionpossible for the rolling forth of the cause of Truth on theseIslands, and for the downfall of Priestcraft, error & wickedness.A perfect unity of sentiment was manifest throughout allour actions, each one felt well and appeared to enjoy a gooddegree of the Holy Spirit, it was a time long to be rememberedby those who were there. No one can tell realise the feelingsthat animate our breasts when we meet together after beingseperated for six or eight months upon these Islands exceptthose who have ^been^ passed through been placed in similar sircu-mstances, a more united band is not often met with, allmanifested a willingness to abide counsel, go wherethey were sent and do what the were told to the best ofthere ability, without grumbling or finding fault.The reports at this Conference show a decreasein numbers since last conference this is not however inconsequence of any material decrease in the work, of recent date.[sideways text] Lanai Apl 17/56Ed.

 Mt Pisgah June 26th. 46Prest Brigham YoungD[ea]r BrotherI haste to inform you thatthe Camp at mt Pisgah was a little excited this mor-ning by the appearance of some of the United StatesTroops ^army^ officers. but we soon met them in Counciland learned that the apparant object of theirvisit was from directions of the President of the U.S. through their Colonel ^Hearney at Fort Leavensworth^ to give us as a peoplean invitation to raise from 300 to 500 Volun-teers for the Mexican War by way of Santa Fee—asthe United States are at war with old Mexico, Upper& Lower California. We directed them to callupon you at Council Bluffs to lay the subject beforeyou that you might have an understanding of the same. A letter will be sent by them to you byway of introduction—so you may be prepared for their coming. We treated them with respect and manifestedto them our thankfulness for the interest the Presidenthas manifested in our behalf. We ascertained this Mor-ning that the Artillery and Cannon were on their wayto you—had stopped by the way side—with one of their pieces dismounted which is the object of our sendingthis messenger to notify Col Scott—to immediatelyremove them from the way side as it would ^not^ appear wellin the eyes of Government to see cannon strewed by the way side. The messenger with this starts 1 hour aheadof the Officers. We thought it wisdom also for the messen-ger to go to you to notify you of their coming. Would it 
 Fort Supply June 20th 1856Bro W. WoodruffSir according to your request I Proceed to give youan account of the conversation I had with Pres Joseph Smith previous tohis Massacre. the first conversation I had with the Prophet On the followingsubjects was the Night; the Guard come in to Take him with a Ritwe walked togather towards the River & sat down. I asked him How thisthing was going to come out. he replied if the Brethern would Let himManage the Business; there should be no blood shed, but if not it wouldbe the hardest Blow the Church ever had or would receive, that if he & Hyrumwere ever taken again the[y] Would be Massacread or he was not a Prophet ofGod, he said he wanted to Save Hyrum to avenge his Blood, he said thatHyrum was determined Not to Leave him but die with him, he told me togo & call Bro Hyrum Bro Willard Richards, Wm Law, W. W. Phelps, John Taylor &several others that I do not now recolect their Names, then he & I turned & walkedup close to the Mansion, as we were walking along we heard the sound of a companyof Horses & Men; as it was now dark he sent me ahead to see what the[y] wereon getting up I found a company of 20 Men from Carthage for about 17 ^having a Writ^for some 17 Men. I talked with them a few Minutes & found out what the[y]wanted & returned & Told Joseph, he told me to return & tell them he wouldsee them the Next day at 10 Oclock, then I called the above named counciltogather & we went up to Joseph Chamber, there we talked over the subject ofthe Writ &c &c, & Joseph said it was the voice of the Spirit for him to go to theWest ^among the Navives [Natives]^ & Take Hyrum & several others along with him & Look out a place for the Church(NB. While siting on the Bank of the River he said he wanted Bro Hyrum to go aboard of theMaid of Iowa & Take Both their famalies to Ohio & Leave him to fight the Battles,at this time he said he wanted to save Hyrum to avenge his Blood). When thecouncil was dismissed about 4 A.M. we all went out to Josephs West gate, there severalof us halted. Joseph Turned & said something to me Like this Bro Markham I wantto Leave you to Take charge of the Legion. thin I replied I will do as you want mewhatever it may be. I will go with you, or stop here & defend the city ontill I dieor go & give myself up just what ever you say I will do. he held his hed Boweddown as though he was in a deep study about a Minute then he said Bro Markhamyou have always done as I wanted you & you always will Now I will tell youwhat to do, go & dismiss the Legion before day Light so that the Men having the Writcannot see that we are Onder arms, & then send My Horse & Hyrums over the River

 but we have been triming up a little—cutting off some of thedry branches—& clearing away some of the rubbish which isonly calculated to cumber the ground. Some who had beenbaptised we were unable to get any clue to whatever. They areso unsettled in their habits & are so continualy on the movefrom one Island to another that it is very difficult to keeptrack of themFor the last few months there has been but littleinterest manifested on these lands in regard to mormonism yetat places we have succeeded in awakening some interest amongthe people, but I think probably the great excitment is past, formormonism is becoming pretty much of an old story. Almostanything new or strange will engage the interests of this peoplebut the excitement soon wears off, when they again fall into theiraccostomed lethergy untill something else comes along toarouse their sleeping faculties.The gathering has went on but slowly in consequence of thecrops being cut off by worms, the past winter has been uncommonlydry, so that between the worms and the drought there will bebut very little rained on this place this season.The debts of the mission have been considerably lightened sincelast conference but are not entirely liquidated, the failure ofthe crops & other circumstances have rather been against us, butyet the Lord has been mindfull of us, and opened up the way beforeus in an unexpected manner, and I have no doubt but all willcome out right. The Saints at this place feel well—better thanat any other place where I have been on the Islands, but the bestof them have many weaknesses and often times a person's patienceis tried with them. When we get them into meeting they will feel firstrate, one would think they could never intentionly do ^anything^ wrong, but theysoon forget all that was told them, which makes it necessary tocontinue to tell them what is right and use the patience of a Job.With sentiments of great respect and prayers for your wellfareI subscribe myself yours in the bonds of the CovenantE.

If I were not driven to the nesesity of laying before you my distressed circumstances, I certianly would not attempt to do so! in consequence of loosing my house in the 16th Ward about 11 years ago To attempt to explain to you on paper would be rather difficult and wearesome how this came about! Since that time I have been obliged to carry on my little business without means, in fact I have been obliged to buy in small quantities from 50 cts to 5 & 10$ worth at a time and genarly have been obliged to go in debt for a few dayesto the Co-op Store sins the boom, my Hous and Shop rent has been rasied from $1700 to $2475c I have to work early and late even to excess to satisfy the above requirements. I am now over 70 years of age. I have no earthly prospects for relief this side the grave unless I can induce some Frind to lend me a helping hand in this distressed condition.

I have sent a man withan Indian to day to asertain the paticulars relative to the timber roads.while drying out our water ditch yesterday we found a peice of stonecoal. there may be coal in the mountain near by but we have not hadtime to explore any since we came here yet. we have built a large damof Rock Brush & gravell. it is about seventy feet long & from ten to fifteen high

 also a Levy near the Bank of the river about forty rods longand four to five feet high. we have had the ^water^ running on ourfarming land some three weeks. we have planted some peas and othergarden seeds some are up and look well. also some potatos and haveset out over four hundred small peach Trees & about three hundred Peachseeds. we have about twenty five acres of land grabbed & Cleared,and ten acres pla[ink spot]. we have Built a log house sixteen By twentyseven feet. I supose there is about one thousand acres of landthat can be Brought into cultivation in the this valley. the Indiansare very friendly. three of them worked with us when makeing the Dam,and I let them have a peice of land to work. there is a small Bandabout six miles down. the river. they came to see me the other day & wantedto know if I would help them a little with a team to build a smalldam where they could get a peice of land to work without troublingor being troubled with the Mormons. they had previously farmedsome with the Brethren at the Clarry Mission, but as there was so manythere they thought they would rather be alone, so after consulting BrotherHamlin ^Prst of the Mission^ on the subject, I sent a team & two men three days to Hall [Haul]rock for them. this will enable them to get the water out and Ithought that the cheapest way to feed them was to help them to raise it.they were well sattisfied & worked well themselves. I received a letter fromPrst B Young a few days since, in which he informed me that he had concludedto vacate S L City. this was rather unexpected news to me at present, but Ifeel that all is right, and if this people are called to pass through privation& suffering, I hope to be able by the help of the Lord, to Bear my part, thatthereby I may be prepared to inherit the glory prepared for the faithfull saintswe have had some cold stormy weather here, and a little snow the Brethrenthat have spent the winter at the cotton farm. say that the weather has beenmore severe during the month of march than any other time duringthe winter. it is not a very good place for stock here, although ourshave done better than what I expected they would from reports that I hadheard of this place, for some of the Brethren Told me when leaving theCity that we ought to carry the land along with us, for that we shouldnot find enough to make a farm of, but this I have proven not to be true.Please give my respects to Br Smoot & Family, & to the Brethren engagedwith you in the office, and to all enquireing friends.

 Kings Arms, King Street, Borough, London Aug 18th, 1840My Dear Phebe,After a spedey journey of 100 ^110^ miles which we travledin 7 hours I have arived (with my Brethren viz Kimball & GA Smith)in the city of London, & feeling disposed to improve evry opportunity of communicating any intelligence to you in my power I improve thepresent moment of droping a few lines to you which I shall put in awrapper & send to Liverpool to Elder Turley hopeing he will get it before he willleave. My last letter which you will receeve by the hand of ElderTurley was Dated Aug 10th 8 days since. I will inform you in few words what I have been about since. We took the parting hand with Eldr Turleyon the 11th for the last time untill we meet him in America. We also spent several days in passing through the Herefordshire & Glostershire churches& taking the parting hand with them which was truly an affecting scene to see hundreds of friends or Saints which we had baptzed into the kingdom flock around us & take us by the hand & weep as though they would breaktheir hearts, appear as though they were taking their leave of their father to see him no more, the many sensations of this kind which I have passed through since I have been in England have been peculiar, to my feelings& clearly show me the Effect that the Everlasting gospel has upon the honestin heart & the meek of the Earth. We held a camp meeting on Sundaythe 16th at the Leigh Gloucestershire which is the last meeting we have had with the Saints, we Baptized 15 while there & ordained one Elder & two Priests. thetwo that we ordained Priests came 12 miles to hear us & they went forward & was Baptized the first sermon & we confirmed & Ordained themat the same time, the work is progressing rapidly in that region, those churches which I built up there now number about 900 all of which have embra[c]ed the work in little more than 5 months they will No 1000 at the end of 6 months from the time that I first preached to the people in that region.17th  we parted with the Saints at the Leigh & travled 5 miles to Cheltenham & spent the night at a Temperance Hotel pop 40,000 (following is a short extract frommy Journal) Aug 18th 1840 I took coach at Cheltenham at 9 oclock P.M. incompany with Eldrr Kimball & G.

Page were set apart to go to Palestine & visit the Jews in Jerrusalem they are on their way & will call upon us in England. Congress has rejected the Bill or petition which the church has lade before them & the Saints have made their final & last appeal to the Court of Heaven& the Throne of God.Phebe stated in her letter that Mother Carter was quite poorly & failed fast which I was sorrow to hear.

 Liverpool, Stanley BuildingsBath StOctober 9, 1845Dear BrotherElder Amos Fielding arrivedon Sunday the 23rd Ultimo, bringing the remaining numbers of the 5th Volume of the "Times and Seasons." He left them in the Customs' depot without taking them throughas baggage, as he did with all others he everbrought, and when I went down to pay duty on them after damning one, andswearing enough to sink a 120 Gun-ship, they sent one through the customshouse, after I got them clear by paying[blank] duty, when I opened the box at the office, I found the whole of the 16th 17th and18th numbers sent, the same having been been sentbefore, it is something I cannot understandI suppose it must have been a mistake in putting them up. I had, consequently, to pay duty on them whereas they will most probably

We passed through Oxfordshire & in about 8 miles of Oxford University the largest & most Noted university in the world which consists of 20 endowed collages & 5 halls not endowed at which place all Europeans finish their studies before they consider themselves perfect schollarsWe saw vast herds of cattle, sheep, & deer. we passed in Light of Stow, & the wychwood forest containing 7,500 acres of timber in which thousands of cattle feed & it is also a Noted place of resort for sportsman to hunt deer, hares, & pheasants, &cwe arived at the farington road station & took cars for London at 1 oclock P.M. passed through Relicks & had a plain view of old ruins & as we passed we also had a fair view of Winser Castle as we passed within about [one] miles of it, which is the reside[n]ce of her Majesty the Queen Victoria when she is not in London. After traveling 70 miles on the rail road we were landed at the London depo we then took coach & rode 3 miles into the centre of the city of London at which place we arived at 4 oclock PM. making 110 miles in 7 hours, & we did not stop more than 2 minutes at a time during the whole journey we left the coach about the centre of the city for it had great difficulty in getting along inconsequence of the solid jam of coaches & human beings which stormed the streets full & we walked across London Bridge over the River Thames which was also crouded with human Beings, & we called upon (Mr's, W. Allgood 19 King Street, Borough, London,) which is Mr W Allgoods Address. Mis Allgood is our sister to Eldr Theadore Turley wife, she treated us kindly &gave us some refreshment which we much needed as we had eat nothing since morningshe then directed us to a publick house near by where I am now sitting in company with Eldrs Kimball & G A Smith for the purpose of writing a letter to my dear wife, while the Brethren are writing to their famili^e^s, & this after having been in the [city] city one hour, I can hardly realize that I am now in the great city of Londonbut so it is, even in the Largest, most Noted, & populous commercial city in the world containing a population of about (1,500,000) one million five hundred thousand human beings, I am in company with Elders H.

Brother Josephis expected here every day to hold a conference with us beforewe part, should he come before I get ready to leaveI should hold a conference with them & then go toMaine immediately.

I was sorry to hear of the sickness of Sisters Eunice, & Shuah. Remember me to all who inquire. We Had a good meeting in this city yesterday, all the Twelve addresssed a large congregation of citizens in the National Hall concer-ning our mission. Brother Ilus & his Mother in Law was present.

 have to be returned.The remaining numbersvaried from 360 @ [&] 410. Whoever put them upwas not very particular in counting.Brother Fielding presented me two $100 orders to pay on your account. I offeredto turn him out [for] your [books] "Times and Seasons" to that amount, but that he refusedto take, and as for money, I had not receivedany (for there have been but few sold sincethey came into my hand) except a few shillings.and I borrowed the money to pay the dutyon those he brought with the few shillings Ihad already received.I have counted all the "Timesand Seasons" over—4th and 5th Vols. sincethey came into my hands. and I foundthe lowest number of vols. 4th was no 14—308—and the highest of that volume, were no's15 and 22 which each numbered 374 and the whole volume varies between those two numbers, so that we have 308 full copiesof Volume 4 and volume 5—the lowestnumber is No 5—289 and the highest is No[blank] which leaves us 289 full copies of Vol: 5.There have been no indexs or title pages sent with any of them.

 in steem Boates. we had clear view of the mint, & Lord Mayors mansion & in fine the whole city. A Prussian traveller, citizen of Berlin was with us, & we had much conversation with him, he had travled over Europe & Asia& many other parts of the world & he del^c^laired this to be the highest monument & the grandest & most sublime prospect, that could be found upon theface of the Earth. As I Before said "this monument was Erected on the ground whereon stood the parish church of St. Margaret, on the east side of fish street hill, in the ward ofBridge, in a square open to the street, to perpetuate the rememberance of the dredful fire on London, in the year 1666. This fine peace of architecture is the design of that great genius Sir Christopher Wren.it is undoubtedly the finest modern column in the world, & in some respects may vie with the most famous of Antiquity, being twenty four feet higher than Trajan's Pillar at Rome." The following is inscribed upon the monument ("In the year of Christ 1666, the second day of September eastward from hence at the distance of 200 feet (the highth of this column) about midnight most terrible fire broke out which driven on by a high wind not ownly wasted the adjacent parts, but also Pa Places vary remotewith incredible noise & fury. It consumed 89 Churches, the City Gates, Guild has^l^l, many public structures hospitals, schools, libraries, a vast number of stately edifices, 13,200 dwelling-houses, 400 streets, of 26 wards, it utterly destroyed 15 & left 8 others shattered and half burnt. The ruins of the city were 436 acres from the Tower by the Thames side to the Temple Church & from the North-east Gate along the city wall to Holborn Bridge. To the estates & fortunes of the citizens it was merciless, but to their lives vary favorable (ownly eight being lost) that it might in all things resemble the last conflagation of the world. The destruction was sudden for in a small space of time, the same city was seen flourishing & reduced to nothing. Three days after, when this fatal firehad baffled all human councils & endeavors the opinion of all, as it were, by the will of Heaven, it stoped& on evry side was extinguished.") Damage done but the fire in all £10,730,500 or $53,652,500 dollars(the above quotation was written in Latin upon the monument) for further information enquire of JohnLyman Smith who has a Pamphlet sent him by G. A. Smith giving evry particular &c. WhileBeholding this indescribable scenery that presents itself from the top of this monument the thought rested upon my mind with peculiar force, that the day is at hand thatwill dissolve all these things, even the rendutions of the last days finished at thecoming of the Mesiah will lay thy splendor in the dust, & give thee O, London agrave in common will [with] the nations of the gentile world.22nd Hark!!! this vary moment Elder Kimball has just came into the room & informed me that he has a package from the post Office for me on opening it I findone letter from B. Young & (one from Phebe. W. Woodruff Under date of July 2nd 1840) which I have just perused with the greatest anxiety & Interest I am truly glad to again hear from you& the children & esspecially to hear that you are enjoying some better health than when you last rote under date of May 4 & 24 which I received. I have also just been informed that the Saints led by Elder Turley will not leave Liverpool untill the 7th of Sept this may give me a chance of sending you another letter still later than this But I don't know but you^(the above named monument was built from 1661 to 67 being 6 years in building & cost £14,500 or $72 500)^

I am nearly surronded withmajestic Hills, mountains, & dens forests, which have just been swept overwith those terriffic fires which have devastated this part of the earth& left a mantle of Darkness & morning over the face thereof,before me on the east However I behold the majestic Bay of Funday spreadout with its majestic & mighty Billows rolling for the Rocky bo[u]ndshore to fulfill the Law of its c^C^reator, by forming a tide inplaces of about 75 feet. for the last hour before the sitting sunI have stood upon an Eminance gazeing upon the grand scenery bef[o]reme, meditating upon the works of God with a degree of both delight& solemnity, & wished I could have had you by my side a few mome[n]tsto have gazed upon the scenery with me, but I was alone exceptmy guardian Angel. After I found a small spot of evergreens a spared momentfrom the burning, I reposed to offered up my prayers ^for my wife, children, Saints, Israel^ according to the Holy Orderof God. I seat myself in a little bedroom whare the family knowethme not to con[v]ers a few moments with you. A pleasing duty indeed. I hope Ishall be able to enjoy the same blessing at your Hand on my arr[i]val atMiramichi As I ha[v]e not heard a word since I left home from you& have not seen your face ownly though a glass darkly. I supposeyou would like to know what I have been about since I last wroteyou well I will tell you one whole week to a day of my time has been spentin a dreary manner by being shut up in a small Harbor 60 miles Eastof Fox Islands called Musketoe or winter Harbor bo[u]nd fast by smoke fog& calm with nothing to clear the heart or please the eye except to wanderover the ragged rocks & forest, pick a few straw berries & wintergreens, see a fewrough fisherman, ketch a few lobsters & fish, & live, eat, drink, & sleep, in 
 amount of each number in both volumessome weeks since which, I suppose, you willhave received.I have been, and will con-tinue, making every exertion in my power tosell what I can of the "Times and Seasons"but hitherto, I have had little success.The cause of God is onward in this countryand doing quite as well throughout the Kingdom as we could possibly expect, considering the few experienced Elders we have in the vine-yard here at the present time.I receiveda few days since, for the first time, a pro-clamation of the Twelve apostles, and according to the request made therein, I shall circulate it through this country. I have made arrangements with the Printer to day, to print 20,000 in English, and shall forward orders for Elder Jones to publishan edition in Welsh, and shall get it pub-lished in French, German and Hebrew, the earliest opportunity.We rejoice muchat the good news received from the City of Joseph and of the progress of the work in America. The "Times and Seasons" and "Neigh-bor" we have received pretty regular for which we feel thankful.I have one favour to ask of you—That you will reserve me a copyof each volume of the "Neighbor" and "Times and Seasons" for my family library, while

I stated that next day I exp[e]cted to be in St Johns, but I was disappo[i]nted. on Monday morning I took my carpet bag on my sholder walked 7 miles to the Stage road & waited 3 Hours for the Stage when it came along it was loaded down & would not take me Had left 5 other passengers back. Here I was on foot 42 miles from St Johns with my carpet bag in Hand & no conveyancefor 3 days I did not stop long to meditate or complain of my situation but swung my carpet bag over my shoulder & startedon my way which lay mostly through those dens burnt forest with but few inhabitants it was twelve miles to the next Stage HomeAfter traveling 5 miles I o[v]ertook an Irishman for company on the same road the ownly benefit from his company might have been in case of an attack from Bears & wolves which inhabited the forestthat I had to go through. I got a man that came along with a waggon to carry my Bag 5 miles to the Stage Home which was a great rele^i^af to me as I could not ride myself. I reached the Stage Homeat 1 oclo[c]k making 19 miles walk. I Here got a chance to send mycarpet Bag by a couple of Ladies to the next Stage Home 16 mils farther where I would Have to walk & stop at night if I went any furtherwhile I was taking dinner I lost the Irishman so I was left alone aga[i]n I started on my journey was already getting vary [illegible] & weary, but I fo[u]ndmy last 16 miles was all I could possibly get through arived at dusk evry cord & sinew in my body was sore from Head to foot for I had walkedabout 35 miles & carried the carpet bag some 15 miles ^such^ a walk I ha[v]e not before taken for 10 years. I could not eat & went to bed sick17th I arose this morning but could Hardly sta[n]d on my feet gotsome breakfast & started for St Johns 16 mils further after walking 1/2a mile I got a ride to St Johns with a gentleman merchant, & it was a great blessing to me for I felt I could ne[v]er walk there. the last 40 miles I came through was all burnt over by the late fires sweeping mills, Hous[e]sLumber yards & evry thing before it. I saw some of the forest still on fire. St Johns is quite a large bus[i]ness place. the steemer was to 
 I consider that is such a case the Lord wouldorder it for Esstablishing stakes in some part ofZion & opening a way for the Delverance of hispeople. For surely the day has come for the Lordto begin to Favor Zion in some way, But my present feelings are that the Saints are in still inNauvoo & if I was to Judge from my feelingsDuring the Last week past, I should almost thnk thatthe Endowment had commenced But I have felt &still feel that the Lord will give the faithful theirEndowmet in the City of Joseph.

O. W.)Thus the most of the apostates seam to be comeing back again. I think it would have been better for them to have conducted themselves so as to have remainedin the church rather than to make work for repentance, I trust that you and I shall take warning by them and be diligent in keeping the commands of God. It truly looks pleasent to me to look forward to the spring when you think of returning home again, y^—^ you speak of makeing sacrifices in being deprived of each others society,—yes truly I think it is the greatest earthlysacrifice that I can make and were it not for Christ sake I feell as though I wuld not endure it—yet I often feell as the poet says, In hopes ofthat immortal crown I now the cross sustain, And gladly wander up and down, And smile at toil and paine. I can say through the mercy and goodness of God that upon mature consideration I have not for the f[page torn]time wished you at home untill your mission is filled then I think you [page torn]return without delay. I have had some trying scenes to pass through since you left me but thank the Lord he has been my friend and suport through them all.

Sister Pratt had a house and lot boughtfor her but the house was not comfortable so they concluded to finish our house forher and got it most done then for some reason she went into another, and sister Taylors house was poor so she wanted me to let her go into it I told her to go—so things standabout so there now I think if you choose to live in Commerce on your returnthe way will be opened for us.

I saw your hand in Brothr Smith letter which I was gladto see & hear from you. I have receved two letters from you since I havebeen in England. I fear all letters that were sent to Preston are lost butone which I got. the signs that were seen riding across the river were of interestThere was a sign seen in the Moon in this country a few evenings sincewhich created some excitement. I will extract it from my Journal. On the 9th Aug 1840there was a sign in the moon the people at great Marlvern Hills in Herefordshire Engnd took a view of itthrough their glasses. The appearance of the Moon was as though it was painted red & while looking atit one part of it fell in peaces & the appearance of a soldier was seen in it, with a white feather in hiscap the No that was on his cap was seen vary plain & a figure 8 on his sholdier they saw his fire lock & gun ready for battle & his dress was clearly seen. Thus signs are appearing in the heavens & Earth.Please write me as soon as you obtain the letters which I send you by Eldr TurleyI pray the Lord to give you & the children health & strength & food & ranent [raiment], the presentprospect is that I shall tarry in some part of Europe untill spring at which time the Lord willingI expect to return to my family give me your prayer you shall have mine Adieuremember me to all who enquireI ever remain yoursW.
