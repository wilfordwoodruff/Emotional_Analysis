 -[COPY.]-    OGDEN, Dec. 23rd 1891.    To whom it may concern:    At a meeting of the High Council of Weber Stake, held December 1st. 1891, in the matter of Job Pingree against  Nathan Tanner Jr., it was decided that the charges against Brother Tanner were not sustained.    ALF. W. MILLGATE,  Clerk of the Council.    -[COPY.]-    SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, MAY 28th, 1892.    To the Presidency and High Council  of the Weber Stake of Zion:    Dear Brethren:    There have been cases tried before your body in which Nathan Tanner, Jr., has been a party. He has been  dissatisfied with the decisions rendered, and has taken an appeal to us, as the first presidency of the Church. The  evidence in the cases has been furnished by Brother A. W. Millgate your clerk.    We have carefully gone through all that has been submitted to us, and not entirely satisfied with the written  evidence, we took the liberty of sending for President L. W. Shurtliff, to obtain information from him upon points  which were not clear to us in the evidence submitted. After hearing from him such explanations as he could furnish,  in addition to the written evidence, we have decided:    First—That instead of the Presidency of the stake and the High Council acting upon the appeal which Brother  Nathan Tanner, Jr[.], made to them from the decision of Bishop McQuarrie and Councilors upon the case decided  by them July 22nd, 1891, by referring it back without hearing to the Bishop's court, to be there further disposed  of, they should have entertained the appeal of Brother Nathan Tanner, and acted upon it.    It appears clear from the evidence, so far as we can understand it, that Brother Tanner had a well grounded  complaint, in that he had a decision rendered against him without the formality of a hearing, and without having any  opportunity to make a defense or justification or explanation of his conduct.    It appears from the record that Brother Tanner had brought to the attention of the Bishop and his councilors  the ill-treatment which he alleges he had received from Brother Job Pingree; and thought he did not make a formal  charge, it was somewhat in the nature of a charge, and was construed as a complaint against Brother Pingree.    The record as submitted to us, does not contain the proceeding which took place before the Bishop's court.   But we have the decision, and in that decision Brother Tanner is condemned    While there may have been sufficient grounds for this decision against Brother Tanner, we think that Brother  Tanner has reason for feeling dissatisfied therewith, because he was not present at the trial of the case, and did not  have an opportunity to defend himself, or to make an explanation.    In expressing our judgemnt upon this point, we do not pronounce upon the merits, or demerits of the case, but  of the irregularity of the proceedings before the Bishop's court. We think that no man's case should be tried without  his having the fullest opportunity to defend himself; neither should judgment be pronounced against him, as in this  case, without his having an opportunity to be heard and make an explanation.    Second,—In a trial before you on [blank] a resolution was adopted by the High Council requir-  ing Brother Tanner to recall the charges he had made, and apologise to Brother Pingree. In pursuance of that resolu-  tion, the minutes state that Brother Tanner said he thought he had done so. "He had intended to do so to meet the  resolution." He then said "I now here unqualifiedly recall every word that I have said with regard to that subject,  and will now say that I regret that I ever used it. I regret that any reference was made to the subject here in this  case, and I ask Brother Pingree's forgiveness[.]" The minutes futher state that at the conclusion of Brother Tanner's   retraction, President Shurtliff asked Brother Pingree if that was satisfactory, and Brother Pingree answered in the  negative. One of the councilors also said that it was not satisfactory to him.    Of course, we can only judge by the minutes that are before us, but upon reading these words of Brother N.  Tanner, Jr., it has seemed to us that Brother Pingree should have been satisfied with that which he said, and not  pushed the matter any further. He had unqualifiedly recalled every word he had said, he had regretted the reference  that had been made to the subject, and he had asked forgiveness. Our judgment is that, that request of his should  have been granted, and it should have been accepted as satisfactory, under the circumstances.    Third—Brother Tanner appeals against the decision of the Presidency and Council that he should go before the  ward and make acknowledgment before the ward, and also before his quorum, for the things he has said in this case  that have been signified by the Council as improper    Brother Tanner in his appeal assigns as reasons for not complying with this, and appealing from the decision:    First.—Because he does not feel that an apology is due.    Second.—Because, if due at all, in his opinion the proper place would be before the council or the bishop and his  counselors, that being the place where the statements were made.    If it be true that the statements which were objected to were made before the council or the bishop and his  counselors, and not in public, then it appears clear to us that he should not be required to go before the public in the  ward and make acknowledgments, but that his acknowledgment should be confined to the place where the statements  complained of were made, and to those who heard him in that place. Of this, we are not in a position to decide, be-  cause we do not know whether his statement is sustained by evidence that he was only before the council when  he made these allegations. But the last paragraphs in Section 42 of the Book of Doctrine and Covenents make  very clear the point that a confession of wrong doing shall be confined to those who have heard or witnessed the wrong  doing, and shall not be made more public than this.    Now after thus deciding upon these points that have been submitted to us, it is clear to our minds that both  Brothers Tanner and Pingree ought, in the most humble manner, to confess the wrongs that each has done, not only to  each other, but to the Church, and to the quorum to which they belong, and show by their humility that they are sorry  for the scandal which their conduct has created in the midst of the saints. We say this without entering into any ar-  gument concerning the right or wrong of either party. It is very evident that a bad spirit has been engendered, and  the saints have had their feelings hurt. Even at this distance from the scene we have been made to painfully feel that  these brethren in their disputes were bringing discredit to the cause of Christ. One may say that the other was the  origin or cause of all this, and that he was provoked to say and do certain things, because of the words or actions of  the other. But even if this be true, it is not a sufficient justification for all that has been said and done in this dispute  or difficulty between these brethren. They both should humble themselves before the Lord, and obtain his forgiveness,  and endeavor to remove whatever bad impression their words or acts may have made upon their brethren and sisters  in the Church.    With kindest regards, we remain, your Brethren,    W. WOODRUFF,  GEO. Q. CANNON,  JOS. F. SMITH.    First Presidency of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Dear Brother:    The time having arrived when we deem it advisable to  release President Ward E. Pack from the duties of the presidency of the  Sandwich Islands Mission to return home to his family and friends in Zion,  we have deemed it wise and proper to appoint you to succeed him in that  important position. We have instructed Elder Pack to turn over to you  all books, papers and accounts, and to give you all information necessary to  enable you to understandingly take hold of the duties of your new calling.    He will also transfer to you all properties, etc., as is usual on such  occasions.    We believe Elder Pack has labored with great diligence and zeal in the  performance of his duties, and in the guidance of the Church. We trust  you will in like manner be blessed of the Lord; and that you will have  s^m^uch success in your labors both temporal and spiritual, and that you will  be enabled to bring many souls to a knowledge of the truth. To this end  we pray God to abundantly bless you, to preserve you from all evil, and in  due time bring you home in safety to the association of the people of God  in Zion.

 Great Salt Lake City Dec 30th 1853    Miss Mary A. Jackson    Madam    I have received your  Note. And in reply woold say. I am ^under^ no obligation to grant  evry request you make of me. at the time you signed  the Bill I made you no promise what amount I would do for  you but I shall use my own judgment in this matter. I made  no agreement to remove Sarah from that house But the revers  that I should not get you a separate house & fire This winter  I never had any ^credit^ from you for any thing that I have ever done  for you neither do I expected it from you, & the more I do  for you the more ungrateful you are, & the wors you act, which  is a poor incouragement to bestow favors upon any one  your constant Ill treatment to Sarah is vary unbecoming in   you and you will not Gain any favors with me by continueing  in it. She has as Good a right in that house as you have  & you are ownly injouring yourself by continuing your ill  treatment to her.     A Concerning your threat of complaining of me to   President Young I would say that does not alarm me  For he is better qualifyed to Judge both man & woman and  their spirits than either of us         As Ever I Remain    W.

I was gone from home 18 months  I started from home on the 8th of Oct 1880—and  arrived at home April 28th 1881    While I was gone I traveled mostly in  Alabama and Miss[issippi] . I was set apart to fill my  mission by Wiliam Taylor    My traveling companion was Elder  John Robertson. We held a good many meetings  and alayed much predgadice. We babptized  one man. We were threatend sevarl times by the   Mobb but the Lord raised up friends to us and  our lives were preseved for which I feel thankfull  We had power given us to heal the sick by the  laying on of hand for the gift of the Holy Gohst    And the promises of the Lord were verified  I enjoyed my mission very much and I feel  to thank Lord his servants sent me and considered  me worthy to be a messenger of life and salvation  to the naitoins of Earth. praying God to abundantly

 Palawai Lanai S. Islands [Society]  April 17th 1856    Brother Woodruff    Dear Sir,    Your letter of Dec. 25th /55  I received the 30th of last month, and was both pleased and  interested by the same, a letter from the mountain home of the  Saints is hi always highly prized and duly appreciated by us  who are obliged to labor for a season on foreign lands. We do  not find much to cheer us—aside from preforming our duty   except what comes from Utah, for in Utah is all we hold dear  on earth; her associations are dear to our hearts. We feel to rejoice  when we hear of her prosperity but sad when we here of her calamities    Our conference of foreign Elders commenced on the 6th inst.  and held four days, after which the Brethren again seperated and  went to their respected fields of labor. My field for the next six  months is on this Island (Lanai) to preside over the Saints who  have gathered to this place. A good feeling attended our confe-  rence—all was peace and harmony, each one appeared to be  edified and strengthened, and to feel determined to use every exertion  possible for the rolling forth of the cause of Truth on these  Islands, and for the downfall of Priestcraft, error & wickedness.    A perfect unity of sentiment was manifest throughout all  our actions, each one felt well and appeared to enjoy a good  degree of the Holy Spirit, it was a time long to be remembered  by those who were there. No one can tell realise the feelings  that animate our breasts when we meet together after being  seperated for six or eight months upon these Islands except  those who have ^been^ passed through been placed in similar sircu-  mstances, a more united band is not often met with, all  manifested a willingness to abide counsel, go where  they were sent and do what the were told to the best of  there ability, without grumbling or finding fault.    The reports at this Conference show a decrease  in numbers since last conference this is not however in  consequence of any material decrease in the work, of recent date.

 Mt Pisgah June 26th. 46    Prest Brigham Young    D[ea]r Brother    I haste to inform you that  the Camp at mt Pisgah was a little excited this mor-  ning by the appearance of some of the United States  Troops ^army^ officers. but we soon met them in Council  and learned that the apparant object of their  visit was from directions of the President of the   U.S. through their Colonel ^Hearney at Fort Leavensworth^ to give us as a people  an invitation to raise from 300 to 500 Volun-  teers for the Mexican War by way of Santa Fee—as  the United States are at war with old Mexico, Upper  & Lower California. We directed them to call  upon you at Council Bluffs to lay the subject before  you that you might have an understanding of the   same. A letter will be sent by them to you by  way of introduction—so you may be prepared for their   coming. We treated them with respect and manifested  to them our thankfulness for the interest the President  has manifested in our behalf. We ascertained this Mor-  ning that the Artillery and Cannon were on their way  to you—had stopped by the way side—with one of their   pieces dismounted which is the object of our sending  this messenger to notify Col Scott—to immediately  remove them from the way side as it would ^not^ appear well  in the eyes of Government to see cannon strewed by the   way side. The messenger with this starts 1 hour ahead  of the Officers. We thought it wisdom also for the messen-  ger to go to you to notify you of their coming. Would it 
 Fort Supply June 20th 1856    Bro W. Woodruff    Sir according to your request I Proceed to give you  an account of the conversation I had with Pres Joseph Smith previous to  his Massacre. the first conversation I had with the Prophet On the following  subjects was the Night; the Guard come in to Take him with a Rit  we walked togather towards the River & sat down. I asked him How this  thing was going to come out. he replied if the Brethern would Let him  Manage the Business; there should be no blood shed, but if not it would  be the hardest Blow the Church ever had or would receive, that if he & Hyrum  were ever taken again the[y] Would be Massacread or he was not a Prophet of  God, he said he wanted to Save Hyrum to avenge his Blood, he said that  Hyrum was determined Not to Leave him but die with him, he told me to  go & call Bro Hyrum Bro Willard Richards, Wm Law, W. W. Phelps, John Taylor &  several others that I do not now recolect their Names, then he & I turned & walked  up close to the Mansion, as we were walking along we heard the sound of a company  of Horses & Men; as it was now dark he sent me ahead to see what the[y] were  on getting up I found a company of 20 Men from Carthage for about 17 ^having a Writ^  for some 17 Men. I talked with them a few Minutes & found out what the[y]  wanted & returned & Told Joseph, he told me to return & tell them he would  see them the Next day at 10 Oclock, then I called the above named council  togather & we went up to Joseph Chamber, there we talked over the subject of  the Writ &c &c, & Joseph said it was the voice of the Spirit for him to go to the  West ^among the Navives [Natives]^ & Take Hyrum & several others along with him & Look out a place for the Church    (NB. While siting on the Bank of the River he said he wanted Bro Hyrum to go aboard of the  Maid of Iowa & Take Both their famalies to Ohio & Leave him to fight the Battles,  at this time he said he wanted to save Hyrum to avenge his Blood). When the  council was dismissed about 4 A.M. we all went out to Josephs West gate, there several  of us halted. Joseph Turned & said something to me Like this Bro Markham I want  to Leave you to Take charge of the Legion. thin I replied I will do as you want me  whatever it may be. I will go with you, or stop here & defend the city ontill I die  or go & give myself up just what ever you say I will do. he held his hed Bowed  down as though he was in a deep study about a Minute then he said Bro Markham  you have always done as I wanted you & you always will Now I will tell you  what to do, go & dismiss the Legion before day Light so that the Men having the Writ  cannot see that we are Onder arms, & then send My Horse & Hyrums over the River 
 bless you in you high and holy calling. I remain  your Bro in the Gospel of Christ    Adam Wilcox.

 but we have been triming up a little—cutting off some of the  dry branches—& clearing away some of the rubbish which is  only calculated to cumber the ground. Some who had been  baptised we were unable to get any clue to whatever. They are  so unsettled in their habits & are so continualy on the move  from one Island to another that it is very difficult to keep  track of them    For the last few months there has been but little  interest manifested on these lands in regard to mormonism yet  at places we have succeeded in awakening some interest among  the people, but I think probably the great excitment is past, for  mormonism is becoming pretty much of an old story. Almost  anything new or strange will engage the interests of this people  but the excitement soon wears off, when they again fall into their  accostomed lethergy untill something else comes along to  arouse their sleeping faculties.    The gathering has went on but slowly in consequence of the  crops being cut off by worms, the past winter has been uncommonly  dry, so that between the worms and the drought there will be  but very little rained on this place this season.    The debts of the mission have been considerably lightened since  last conference but are not entirely liquidated, the failure of  the crops & other circumstances have rather been against us, but  yet the Lord has been mindfull of us, and opened up the way before  us in an unexpected manner, and I have no doubt but all will  come out right. The Saints at this place feel well—better than  at any other place where I have been on the Islands, but the best  of them have many weaknesses and often times a person's patience  is tried with them. When we get them into meeting they will feel first  rate, one would think they could never intentionly do ^anything^ wrong, but they  soon forget all that was told them, which makes it necessary to  continue to tell them what is right and use the patience of a Job.

 Salt Lake City Jan – 9th 1889    Presedent Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother! If I were   not driven to the nesesity of laying before you   my distressed circumstances, I certianly would   not attempt to do so! in consequence of loosing   my house in the 16th Ward about 11 years ago   To attempt to explain to you on paper would   be rather difficult and wearesome how this came   about! Since that time I have been obliged to   carry on my little business without means, in fact   I have been obliged to buy in small quantities   from 50 cts to 5 & 10$ worth at a time and genarly   have been obliged to go in debt for a few dayes  to the Co-op Store sins the boom, my Hous and   Shop rent has been rasied from $1700 to $2475c   I have to work early and late even to excess   to satisfy the above requirements. I am now over   70 years of age. I have no earthly prospects for   relief this side the grave unless I can induce some   Frind to lend me a helping hand in this distressed   condition. Dear Brother Woodruff would it be posable   for you as a Trustee in Trust to extend to me 
 Heberville Washington County April 10th, 1858    Dear Brother    I sit down to write a few lines to  you, hopeing that they will find your & your ^family^ all in the  enjoyment of good health. we had a plesant journey to  this place, and arived all in good health. we did not find the  place spoken of By Br J D Lee at the Mouth of the Clarry river,  to be very convenient to make a farm, on account of the Banks  of the river being so high above the water, but By examining  the river below the forks I concluded to make a farm at  our present Location, which is about one mile south of the  forks. it is on the riove^i^rgin which is a large stream suposed to  be nearly as large as the Jorden. its Bottoms are fertile and form  half a mile to a mile in width. there is not much grass it is Cheifly covered  with Brush. there is plenty of Building Rock within one mile of our  camp, and an abundance of Lime stone about four miles ^from^ here. there is  no timber in this valley excpt a few scatering cottonwoods. there is a mountain  south of here suposed to be from fifteen to twenty miles distant, that  is covered with timber. the Indians say it is Pine. I have sent a man with  an Indian to day to asertain the paticulars relative to the timber roads.  while drying out our water ditch yesterday we found a peice of stone  coal. there may be coal in the mountain near by but we have not had  time to explore any since we came here yet. we have built a large dam  of Rock Brush & gravell. it is about seventy feet long & from ten to fifteen high

On ariving at Nauvoo I found the Governor  on Porter Rockwells frame Making quite an Inflamitory speach to the people  about that Time 2 of the [Marrs] & 10 others handed in their Names to the Governor  acompanied with afidavids that the[y] were afraid of their Lives. the Gov  Turned to the people & said Gentlemen you do not Know the danger you are in  if there is any of these men Missing onder any Circumstance whatever, your Lives  & the Lives of your Wives & children will atone for it. your houses are as  it were on Kegs of Powder & the Matches are all ready ^lit^ to set it of[f].

I replied you are a Damed Lier  he turned in to the West dore of the Mansion & Left me.    the Next morning G. D. Grant came to my house at daylight & told me  that Joseph & Hyrum were Killed in Jail. Bro Grant said he was coming into  Nauvoo & was within 2 Miles of the City when the Governor met him. he told  the Gov what transpired at Carthage. he was then Taken into Custady & marched  2 Miles East of Carthage. the Gov said if he would Let him go to the  City Markham would Call out the Legion & destroy Carthage & Warsaw  before Morning. & then get fresh Horses & follow us and Kill us off    Respectfuly    Stephen Markham    [sideways text]   Historians Office  G.

 also a Levy near the Bank of the river about forty rods long  and four to five feet high. we have had the ^water^ running on our  farming land some three weeks. we have planted some peas and other  garden seeds some are up and look well. also some potatos and have  set out over four hundred small peach Trees & about three hundred Peach  seeds. we have about twenty five acres of land grabbed & Cleared,  and ten acres pla[ink spot]. we have Built a log house sixteen By twenty  seven feet. I supose there is about one thousand acres of land  that can be Brought into cultivation in the this valley. the Indians  are very friendly. three of them worked with us when makeing the Dam,  and I let them have a peice of land to work. there is a small Band  about six miles down. the river. they came to see me the other day & wanted  to know if I would help them a little with a team to build a small  dam where they could get a peice of land to work without troubling  or being troubled with the Mormons. they had previously farmed  some with the Brethren at the Clarry Mission, but as there was so many  there they thought they would rather be alone, so after consulting Brother  Hamlin ^Prst of the Mission^ on the subject, I sent a team & two men three days to Hall [Haul]  rock for them. this will enable them to get the water out and I  thought that the cheapest way to feed them was to help them to raise it.  they were well sattisfied & worked well themselves. I received a letter from  Prst B Young a few days since, in which he informed me that he had concluded  to vacate S L City. this was rather unexpected news to me at present, but I  feel that all is right, and if this people are called to pass through privation  & suffering, I hope to be able by the help of the Lord, to Bear my part, that  thereby I may be prepared to inherit the glory prepared for the faithfull saints  we have had some cold stormy weather here, and a little snow the Brethren  that have spent the winter at the cotton farm. say that the weather has been  more severe during the month of march than any other time during  the winter. it is not a very good place for stock here, although ours  have done better than what I expected they would from reports that I had  heard of this place, for some of the Brethren Told me when leaving the  City that we ought to carry the land along with us, for that we should  not find enough to make a farm of, but this I have proven not to be true.  Please give my respects to Br Smoot & Family, & to the Brethren engaged  with you in the office, and to all enquireing friends. I should be  happy to receive Letters from you at any time when it is convenient.  so no more at present from your friend and Brother in  the Gosple of Christ    Joseph Horne    PS Please excuse the half sheet  as I am almost out of paper

If I could   remain home until next  fall I can leave my family   with wood nearly enough,  if I have my health, to   keep them supplied during   my absence, and I can raise   grain enough, with the bles-  sings of the Lord, to bread  them, so my family will not  be dependant for assistance,   very much, while I am  gone.

 Kings Arms, King Street, Borough, London Aug 18th, 1840    My Dear Phebe,    After a spedey journey of 100 ^110^ miles which we travled  in 7 hours I have arived (with my Brethren viz Kimball & GA Smith)  in the city of London, & feeling disposed to improve evry opportunity of   communicating any intelligence to you in my power I improve the  present moment of droping a few lines to you which I shall put in a  wrapper & send to Liverpool to Elder Turley hopeing he will get it before he will  leave. My last letter which you will receeve by the hand of Elder  Turley was Dated Aug 10th 8 days since. I will inform you in few words   what I have been about since. We took the parting hand with Eldr Turley  on the 11th for the last time untill we meet him in America. We   also spent several days in passing through the Herefordshire & Glostershire churches  & taking the parting hand with them which was truly an affecting scene   to see hundreds of friends or Saints which we had baptzed into the kingdom   flock around us & take us by the hand & weep as though they would break  their hearts, appear as though they were taking their leave of their father to   see him no more, the many sensations of this kind which I have passed   through since I have been in England have been peculiar, to my feelings  & clearly show me the Effect that the Everlasting gospel has upon the honest  in heart & the meek of the Earth. We held a camp meeting on Sunday  the 16th at the Leigh Gloucestershire which is the last meeting we have had with   the Saints, we Baptized 15 while there & ordained one Elder & two Priests. the  two that we ordained Priests came 12 miles to hear us & they went   forward & was Baptized the first sermon & we confirmed & Ordained them  at the same time, the work is progressing rapidly in that region, those churches   which I built up there now number about 900 all of which have embra[c]ed   the work in little more than 5 months they will No 1000 at the end of   6 months from the time that I first preached to the people in that region.  17th  we parted with the Saints at the Leigh & travled 5 miles to Cheltenham &   spent the night at a Temperance Hotel pop 40,000 (following is a short extract from  my Journal) Aug 18th 1840 I took coach at Cheltenham at 9 oclock P.M. in  company with Eldrr Kimball & G. A. Smith it was an exceding chilly day   we rode 40 miles through a level country having quite the appearance of   the Illinois & Mo prairies occupied altogethr for farming, we past three small villages  & many thousands of acres of wheat & Barley fields in the midst of harvest part of which

I had £13 pounds in my pocket when   I came into the city worth about $65 dollars but money goes fast in this   city as we have as yet no doors open but have to pay high in all our   daily expe[n]ses. I am confident it is well that Sister Taylor does not come   for it is growing wors & wors in this country. Phebe dont share this peace   of writing will you.

 Emigration of the Saints to that country is rapid commerce is grow-  ing fast, the work rolling on many are being baptized, &c. (Willford Woodruff Jr.  first made his appearance at Montrose On the 22nd day of March 1840 & in two   weeks after attended the general conference at commerce with his Mother   who was quite well & comfortable.) they had quite an interesting time  at conference rising of 70 was Baptized two of the Twelve viz O Hide &   John E. Page were set apart to go to Palestine & visit the Jews in   Jerrusalem they are on their way & will call upon us in England. Congress   has rejected the Bill or petition which the church has lade before them & the   Saints have made their final & last appeal to the Court of Heaven  & the Throne of God.    Phebe stated in her letter that Mother Carter   was quite poorly & failed fast which I was sorrow to hear. I have written   a letter to day to Father & Mother Carter & also one to Phebe. I should  essteem it a favor to receeve a letter from you please to send by P P.   Pratt who will return direct to England or otherwise direct your letters   to me at 149 Oldham Road, Manchester, England. Trade & business is bad   in this country the oppression of the poor is great, many are in a state of   starvation in England & Ireland times are growing wors & wors temporally thoughout   Europe. A company of 40 Saints left Liverpool for America a short   time Since & we expect anothe large company will start in   few weeks they will be led by Eldr Theodore Turley to Commerce  I am expecting to spend a few days with them to give them some council  about their journey, & also to send some things to my family. I do not   know at present when I shall again return to America but it will   be as soon as circumstances will will admit & the Lord will.    I have written letters to you since I have been in England I do   not know whether you have obtained them or not. I have not   herd any thing from you since I left you in New York  I wish to be remembered to all friends inquiring friends.

He left them in   the Customs' depot without taking them through  as baggage, as he did with all others he ever  brought, and when I went down to pay   duty on them after damning one, and  swearing enough to sink a 120 Gun-  ship, they sent one through the customs  house, after I got them clear by paying  [blank] duty, when I opened the box at the   office, I found the whole of the 16th 17th and  18th numbers sent, the same having been been sent  before, it is something I cannot understand  I suppose it must have been a mistake in   putting them up. I had, consequently, to pay   duty on them whereas they will most probably

I have received a copy of "The  Proclamation of the Twelve" and ordered 20,000 of them  to be printed in English which I shall cause to be  circulated as widely as possible through the British  Mission; and as soon as an opportunity affords  they will be published in Welsh. We have just received  the "Neighbor" with news tracking the ravages of the  Mob and the destruction of 44 houses in Greene  Plains and Lima Precincts. if you have any news  touching the termination of the affair or any further  proceedings, I would be glad did you drop me a few  lines, and not only so, but at any time when you  have news previous to it's appearing in the paper, you 
 was cut & part standing. We passed through Oxfordshire & in about 8 miles   of Oxford University the largest & most Noted university in the world   which consists of 20 endowed collages & 5 halls not endowed at which place   all Europeans finish their studies before they consider themselves perfect schollars  We saw vast herds of cattle, sheep, & deer. we passed in Light of Stow, & the   wychwood forest containing 7,500 acres of timber in which thousands of cattle feed   & it is also a Noted place of resort for sportsman to hunt deer, hares, & pheasants, &c  we arived at the farington road station & took cars for London at 1 oclock P.M.   passed through Relicks & had a plain view of old ruins & as we passed we also had a   fair view of Winser Castle as we passed within about [one] miles of it, which is the reside[n]ce   of her Majesty the Queen Victoria when she is not in London. After traveling 70 miles   on the rail road we were landed at the London depo we then took coach & rode 3 miles into   the centre of the city of London at which place we arived at 4 oclock PM. making 110 miles   in 7 hours, & we did not stop more than 2 minutes at a time during the whole journey   we left the coach about the centre of the city for it had great difficulty in getting along in  consequence of the solid jam of coaches & human beings which stormed the streets full   & we walked across London Bridge over the River Thames which was also crouded with human   Beings, & we called upon (Mr's, W. Allgood 19 King Street, Borough, London,) which is Mr W Allgoods   Address. Mis Allgood is our sister to Eldr Theadore Turley wife, she treated us kindly &  gave us some refreshment which we much needed as we had eat nothing since morning  she then directed us to a publick house near by where I am now sitting in company   with Eldrs Kimball & G A Smith for the purpose of writing a letter to my dear   wife, while the Brethren are writing to their famili^e^s, & this after having been in the [city]   city one hour, I can hardly realize that I am now in the great city of London  but so it is, even in the Largest, most Noted, & populous commercial city in the world containing   a population of about (1,500,000) one million five hundred thousand human beings, I am in   company with Elders H. C. Kimball & G. A. Smith we are the first Elders of the Church of Jesus   Christ of latter Day Saints that have ever walked the streets of London in. O London as I   walk thy streets & Behold the mass of human beings passing through thee, & view thy mighty   Pallaces, thy splended mansions, thy spires towering to the clouds, thy costly merchantdize whare with   thou art adorned, ever as the capital of great Babylon, I am ready to In whose midsts stands   the Throne of Earthly crowns, Kings, Queens, Princes, Lords, Dukes, & Nobleman at whose command   [strong] flleets go forth & rule as king of the waters & whose septre is more fully swayed ore the world   than any othr Nation. I am ready to ask what hath brout brought me with my Brethren   to stand in [they] midst & as the spirit answers to warn thee of thine abominations   & cry repentance unto thee that thou mayest be left without excuse in the day   of thy visitation thy calamity thy lamentation & thy wo.

 & several other things may detain me a few days I have  about 100 volumes of the Millennial Star which I wish  to get bound before I leave the city so that they can  be sold while I am gone I have also 125 Books of  Mormon which I also wish to dispence of. Brother Joseph  is expected here every day to hold a conference with us before  we part, should he come before I get ready to leave  I should hold a conference with them & then go to  Maine immediately. I expect to see you in about  a week it may be a little over. Do you get the  times & Seasons the 12 No is interesting they had a   glorious conference in Nauvoo the 6th April the founda-  tion of the House of the Lord was Laid 10,000 persons  were present, & the church was fully organized, all was   union & Harmony. I was sorry to hear of the   sickness of Sisters Eunice, & Shuah. Remember me to   all who inquire. We Had a good meeting in this   city yesterday, all the Twelve addresssed a large   congregation of citizens in the National Hall concer-  ning our mission. Brother Ilus & his Mother in Law   was present. I have had an interesting time with Ilus   I shall leave my things in his care I shall bring   what I think Necessary with me Ilus says he wil[l]  see to your bed. I also brought one with me.

 have to be returned.    The remaining numbers  varied from 360 @ [&] 410. Whoever put them up  was not very particular in counting.    Brother Fielding presented me two   $100 orders to pay on your account. I offered  to turn him out [for] your [books] "Times and   Seasons" to that amount, but that he refused  to take, and as for money, I had not received  any (for there have been but few sold since  they came into my hand) except a few shillings.  and I borrowed the money to pay the duty  on those he brought with the few shillings I  had already received.    I have counted all the "Times  and Seasons" over—4th and 5th Vols. since  they came into my hands. and I found  the lowest number of vols. 4th was no 14—  308—and the highest of that volume, were no's  15 and 22 which each numbered 374 and   the whole volume varies between those two   numbers, so that we have 308 full copies  of Volume 4 and volume 5—the lowest  number is No 5—289 and the highest is No  [blank] which leaves us 289 full copies of Vol:   5.    There have been no indexs or title   pages sent with any of them. I should have   been glad had this been done.    I gave you a minute detail of the

 in steem Boates. we had clear view of the mint, & Lord Mayors mansion &   in fine the whole city. A Prussian traveller, citizen of Berlin was with us, & we   had much conversation with him, he had travled over Europe & Asia  & many other parts of the world & he del^c^laired this to be the highest monument   & the grandest & most sublime prospect, that could be found upon the  face of the Earth. As I Before said "this monument was Erected on the ground   whereon stood the parish church of St. Margaret, on the east side of fish street hill, in the ward of  Bridge, in a square open to the street, to perpetuate the rememberance of the dredful fire on London, in   the year 1666. This fine peace of architecture is the design of that great genius Sir Christopher Wren.  it is undoubtedly the finest modern column in the world, & in some respects may vie with the most famous   of Antiquity, being twenty four feet higher than Trajan's Pillar at Rome." The following is inscribed   upon the monument ("In the year of Christ 1666, the second day of September eastward from hence at   the distance of 200 feet (the highth of this column) about midnight most terrible fire broke out   which driven on by a high wind not ownly wasted the adjacent parts, but also Pa Places vary remote  with incredible noise & fury. It consumed 89 Churches, the City Gates, Guild has^l^l, many public   structures hospitals, schools, libraries, a vast number of stately edifices, 13,200 dwelling-houses, 400   streets, of 26 wards, it utterly destroyed 15 & left 8 others shattered and half burnt. The ruins of   the city were 436 acres from the Tower by the Thames side to the Temple Church & from the   North-east Gate along the city wall to Holborn Bridge. To the estates & fortunes of the citizens it was   merciless, but to their lives vary favorable (ownly eight being lost) that it might in all things resemble   the last conflagation of the world. The destruction was sudden for in a small space of time, the   same city was seen flourishing & reduced to nothing. Three days after, when this fatal fire  had baffled all human councils & endeavors the opinion of all, as it were, by the will of Heaven, it stoped  & on evry side was extinguished.") Damage done but the fire in all £10,730,500 or $53,652,500 dollars  (the above quotation was written in Latin upon the monument) for further information enquire of John  Lyman Smith who has a Pamphlet sent him by G. A. Smith giving evry particular &c. While  Beholding this indescribable scenery that presents itself from the top of this monument   the thought rested upon my mind with peculiar force, that the day is at hand that  will dissolve all these things, even the rendutions of the last days finished at the  coming of the Mesiah will lay thy splendor in the dust, & give thee O, London a  grave in common will [with] the nations of the gentile world.    22nd Hark!!! this vary moment Elder Kimball has just came into   the room & informed me that he has a package from the post Office for me on opening it I find  one letter from B. Young & (one from Phebe. W. Woodruff Under date of July 2nd 1840) which I   have just perused with the greatest anxiety & Interest I am truly glad to again hear from you  & the children & esspecially to hear that you are enjoying some better health than when you last   rote under date of May 4 & 24 which I received. I have also just been informed that the Saints   led by Elder Turley will not leave Liverpool untill the 7th of Sept this may give me a chance   of sending you another letter still later than this But I don't know but you  ^(the above named monument was built from 1661 to 67 being 6 years in building & cost £14,500 or $72 500)^ 
 My Dear Willford    As father Cand Mr. Moulton has filled the first page  of this sheet I sit down (at the little table in the north chamber where you used  to write so much when at father) to tell you a little about matters with me  and our little Willford Owen,—my health is good and his is better than it   ever has been before, he seames to have got quite well of the ague and grows finely  I suppose you ^will^ have learned before this reaches you that I am Scarborough  as I wrote you while in N.Y. at brother Ilus's. It was a good opportunity for   me to come home and I hope you have no objections to my improveing it, and   spending the winter with my friends.    I have now^t^ heard from you since the  8th of last july untill verry lately when a mail brought me a letter from sister  Kimball with one from you enclosed in it dated july 19th and one for father dated   London Nov. 9th. I was truly glad to see them it was quite pleaseing to me to learn   that you was thinking of comeing home in the spring and of your health and  prosperity. Please tell me in your next letter what time you think of starting  for America. Your letters contained much information. I learned by fathers  that you had heared of the death of our dear child, I find that time or dis-  tance does not diminish my affection, for her—when I went to Commerce  I did not forget to visit her grave and strew it with flowers or leaves or something  that would please her when living—sister Kimball mentioned some things   you sent designed for her and shall I not say O! that she was liveing that   she might enjoy them and we enjoy her little prattles and society even when you   return, but I forbarre. Brother Turley had not arrived when when we left   Montrose but has since and sister Kimball ^says he^ has brought me many presents and   some for the children a cap for Willford 2 dress patterns the china box you men-  tioned in your letter to father, 2 china pitchers 5 sovereigns in the box and and  & two sovereigns in 2 letters and one halfe one in another she conclude by the sixe  of them, she had not opened them and other things to numerous to mention  she has them in her care and will no doubt keep them safe untill my our return   she is a good woman and a sister that I love and respect—please give my respects   to brother Kimball if he is with you. Sister Sarah Milliken wrote some   in sister Kimballs letter,—she says the steambaoat Nauvoo, returned there the last of

I am not alarmed at any  of these things Neither should I be if the Sants  should Leave Hancock Co for a season & go into  the wilderness or anywhare els whare the Lord should order

 Beaver Harbor, Bay of Funday, N. B. Sunday evening, July 14th, 1849.    My Dear Phebe    I seat myself on the top of a High, Romantic Mountain or Hill  to comens a few moments once more with you. I am nearly surronded with  majestic Hills, mountains, & dens forests, which have just been swept over  with those terriffic fires which have devastated this part of the earth  & left a mantle of Darkness & morning over the face thereof,  before me on the east However I behold the majestic Bay of Funday spread  out with its majestic & mighty Billows rolling for the Rocky bo[u]nd  shore to fulfill the Law of its c^C^reator, by forming a tide in  places of about 75 feet. for the last hour before the sitting sun  I have stood upon an Eminance gazeing upon the grand scenery bef[o]re  me, meditating upon the works of God with a degree of both delight  & solemnity, & wished I could have had you by my side a few mome[n]ts  to have gazed upon the scenery with me, but I was alone except  my guardian Angel. After I found a small spot of evergreens a spared moment  from the burning, I reposed to offered up my prayers ^for my wife, children, Saints, Israel^ according to the Holy Order  of God. I seat myself in a little bedroom whare the family knoweth  me not to con[v]ers a few moments with you. A pleasing duty indeed. I hope I  shall be able to enjoy the same blessing at your Hand on my arr[i]val at  Miramichi As I ha[v]e not heard a word since I left home from you  & have not seen your face ownly though a glass darkly. I suppose  you would like to know what I have been about since I last wrote  you well I will tell you one whole week to a day of my time has been spent  in a dreary manner by being shut up in a small Harbor 60 miles East  of Fox Islands called Musketoe or winter Harbor bo[u]nd fast by smoke fog  & calm with nothing to clear the heart or please the eye except to wander  over the ragged rocks & forest, pick a few straw berries & wintergreens, see a few  rough fisherman, ketch a few lobsters & fish, & live, eat, drink, & sleep, in 
 amount of each number in both volumes  some weeks since which, I suppose, you will  have received.    I have been, and will con-  tinue, making every exertion in my power to  sell what I can of the "Times and Seasons"  but hitherto, I have had little success.    The cause of God is onward in this country  and doing quite as well throughout the Kingdom   as we could possibly expect, considering the   few experienced Elders we have in the vine-  yard here at the present time.    I received  a few days since, for the first time, a pro-  clamation of the Twelve apostles, and   according to the request made therein, I   shall circulate it through this country. I   have made arrangements with the Printer to   day, to print 20,000 in English, and shall   forward orders for Elder Jones to publish  an edition in Welsh, and shall get it pub-  lished in French, German and Hebrew, the   earliest opportunity.    We rejoice much  at the good news received from the City of   Joseph and of the progress of the work in   America. The "Times and Seasons" and "Neigh-  bor" we have received pretty regular for which   we feel thankful.    I have one favour to   ask of you—That you will reserve me a copy  of each volume of the "Neighbor" and "Times   and Seasons" for my family library, while

 will get tired of reading so many letters from me at once but perhaps  it may make up the vacancy of five long months in which you have not  herd from me though I have not let that length of time slip without  writing to you. I have never seen any account giving particlulars of  your situation for the first few months after I left you untill the letter  I receved this day. I am well aware you have suffered some of the time  since I left you for the wait of friends or some one to assist you  in your sickness, aflictions, & poverty. these things are painful to my feelings  yet I rejoice at the resignation you have ever manifested to the will of  God in all these things. yea it hath been a source of much gratification  to me in my meditations while seperated from you, that God hath  Blessed me with a companion in this life who hath ever manifested a fixed  principle, & a settled determination, to follow the Lord Jesus Christ &  obtain a celestial glory though it hath thus far led th[page torn]  a path [page torn] sacrafice, affliction; poverty, & trial, But I still [page torn]  us be [page torn] patient as we can under all these circumstances.

 Joseph Russells Miramichi July 24th 1849    I will continue my journal from my last letter  which was written on the Sunday 15th inst. I stated that next day I exp[e]cted   to be in St Johns, but I was disappo[i]nted. on Monday morning I took   my carpet bag on my sholder walked 7 miles to the Stage road & waited   3 Hours for the Stage when it came along it was loaded down & would   not take me Had left 5 other passengers back. Here I was on foot   42 miles from St Johns with my carpet bag in Hand & no conveyance  for 3 days I did not stop long to meditate or complain of my   situation but swung my carpet bag over my shoulder & started  on my way which lay mostly through those dens burnt forest with   but few inhabitants it was twelve miles to the next Stage Home  After traveling 5 miles I o[v]ertook an Irishman for company on the   same road the ownly benefit from his company might have been in   case of an attack from Bears & wolves which inhabited the forest  that I had to go through. I got a man that came along with a   waggon to carry my Bag 5 miles to the Stage Home which was a great   rele^i^af to me as I could not ride myself. I reached the Stage Home  at 1 oclo[c]k making 19 miles walk. I Here got a chance to send my  carpet Bag by a couple of Ladies to the next Stage Home 16 mils farther   where I would Have to walk & stop at night if I went any further  while I was taking dinner I lost the Irishman so I was left alone aga[i]n   I started on my journey was already getting vary [illegible] & weary, but I fo[u]nd  my last 16 miles was all I could possibly get through arived at dusk   evry cord & sinew in my body was sore from Head to foot for I had walked  about 35 miles & carried the carpet bag some 15 miles ^such^ a walk I ha[v]e   not before taken for 10 years. I could not eat & went to bed sick    17th I arose this morning but could Hardly sta[n]d on my feet got  some breakfast & started for St Johns 16 mils further after walking 1/2  a mile I got a ride to St Johns with a gentleman merchant, & it was a great   blessing to me for I felt I could ne[v]er walk there. the last 40 miles   I came through was all burnt over by the late fires sweeping mills, Hous[e]s  Lumber yards & evry thing before it. I saw some of the forest still on   fire. St Johns is quite a large bus[i]ness place. the steemer was to 
 I consider that is such a case the Lord would  order it for Esstablishing stakes in some part of  Zion & opening a way for the Delverance of his  people. For surely the day has come for the Lord  to begin to Favor Zion in some way, But my   present feelings are that the Saints are in still in  Nauvoo & if I was to Judge from my feelings  During the Last week past, I should almost thnk that  the Endowment had commenced But I have felt &  still feel that the Lord will give the faithful their  Endowmet in the City of Joseph. One thing I greatly  desire of the Lord That his servents Brigham Y[o]u[n]g, Heber  C Kimball, W Richards, P. P. Pratt, & their remaing  Brother the Twelve, will never give themselves up &  sacrafice their valuable lives to gratify the feelings of  an ungodly gentile mob, or to quiet the fears of  any Cowards though they should fear the name of  Saints, or to save the City of Nauvoo itsef  But rather live to guide, council & govern Zion  in her rising Beauty & glory for such Sons she  will Need to guide her in her future days. I had

O. W.)    Thus the most of the apostates seam to be comeing back again. I think it   would have been better for them to have conducted themselves so as to have remained  in the church rather than to make work for repentance, I trust that you and   I shall take warning by them and be diligent in keeping the commands of   God. It truly looks pleasent to me to look forward to the spring when you   think of returning home again, y^—^ you speak of makeing sacrifices in being   deprived of each others society,—yes truly I think it is the greatest earthly  sacrifice that I can make and were it not for Christ sake I feell as   though I wuld not endure it—yet I often feell as the poet says, In hopes of  that immortal crown I now the cross sustain, And gladly wander up   and down, And smile at toil and paine. I can say through the mercy   and goodness of God that upon mature consideration I have not for the f[page torn]  time wished you at home untill your mission is filled then I think you [page torn]  return without delay. I have had some trying scenes to pass through since you left me   but thank the Lord he has been my friend and suport through them all. Do come  home as early in the spring as you can consistently and if you can bring some means  with you to carry us on to Montrose I should be glad as we shall need it. You spoke  about my haveing a house built in Commerce our house was put up to the roof and   one for sister Taylor then they ceased to do more. Sister Pratt had a house and lot bought  for her but the house was not comfortable so they concluded to finish our house for  her and got it most done then for some reason she went into another, and sister Taylors   house was poor so she wanted me to let her go into it I told her to go—so things stand  about so there now I think if you choose to live in Commerce on your return  the way will be opened for us. I feel to rejoice in your prosperity since you have  been in Eng. and hope the Lord will still bless you and return you home safely is the prayr of your   Phebe.    I must give way for Shuah    [Letter from Phebe ends]    [Letter from Shuah begins]    Jan 12    Many thanks my dear Brother for the kind rembrance in your late  communication the perusal of which afforded us much pleasure to learn   of your health prosperity &c.

I saw your hand in Brothr Smith letter which I was glad  to see & hear from you. I have receved two letters from you since I have  been in England. I fear all letters that were sent to Preston are lost but  one which I got. the signs that were seen riding across the river were of interest  There was a sign seen in the Moon in this country a few evenings since  which created some excitement. I will extract it from my Journal. On the 9th Aug 1840  there was a sign in the moon the people at great Marlvern Hills in Herefordshire Engnd took a view of it  through their glasses. The appearance of the Moon was as though it was painted red & while looking at  it one part of it fell in peaces & the appearance of a soldier was seen in it, with a white feather in his  cap the No that was on his cap was seen vary plain & a figure 8 on his sholdier they saw his fire lock &   gun ready for battle & his dress was clearly seen. Thus signs are appearing in the heavens & Earth.  Please write me as soon as you obtain the letters which I send you by Eldr Turley  I pray the Lord to give you & the children health & strength & food & ranent [raiment], the present  prospect is that I shall tarry in some part of Europe untill spring at which time the Lord willing  I expect to return to my family give me your prayer you shall have mine Adieu  remember me to all who enquire    I ever remain yours    W.
