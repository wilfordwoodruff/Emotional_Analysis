President Wilford Woodruf,  S. L. City,  Dear Brother:  Your letter of Sept. 23, was a great surprise to me, as I had not been spoken to until I received your letter.  I feel like honoring the call; but owing to circum- stances, and the shorte notice I cannot leave at the time stated. As, I am jurst intending to enter upon the sea of matrimony, and have comenced to build a home, I do not think it wisdom to let and the material go to ruin.  Besides I could not feel content to go without getting married, and placing my wife in a home, and it would be impossablel to have it done by that time.  Probably by extending the time a month, that I might get ready, if it could be jurst as convenient in traveling and answer the purpos.  Pleas let me know imediately.  I remain your humble servent. L.

Dier Brother  Last January I was called to go on a Mission to Germany. I was told to start from Salt Lake City on Feb the 7th.  I answered the Letter and said I would go but at the same time stated my Circumstances upon which I was honorably released. But Brother Wm. Budge told me that my Name would still be kept on the Missionary List and I should prepar myself to go as soon as I would be called gagain.  Now I have done so and I am now better prepared than I was a year ago. My Familie is where I would like to leave them while I would be away on my Mission here in Garden City where they can attend Meettings and Sunday Schools although my Property is very Little and no wheres near to supply there wants, but with the help of the Lord and oure good Bishop they would get along allright.  I can pay my debts allright but will have not much to spare unless I could sell some Horses of which I have three and good one's, and would rather not sell them.  Now what I would like to know is this: I would like to go to the Colonies of Mexico in order to leave ^live^ in Peace surounded by all of my Familie of which I have been moore or less deprived in the last three years or more. I aslso think it is fully as good a Country to make a Living in or leave a Familie while gone abroad. ENDENTRY sideways text Nov 5 1890. Geo. Webb. Lehi.

Dear Brother, I write you in regard to the call of Brother Christian Madsen, to perform a Mission; Our Brother, Dr C. Madsen's Services in this community are -we consider- very valuable, we have found him in cases of Diptheria without an equal, but, he has shown- to our satisfaction, that he  labour's as much for the Interest of the com- munity, as for himself, his charges are so moderate,  But, in regard to his present circumstances, they are not such, as would Justify him in leaving his family, as he is considerably in- volved, through the purchase of a Residence here - the property of one of our brethren, who had to leave here - in consequence of being a Polygamist, Bro Madsen had to borrow the money to make the purchase, and that, by our Counsel and advice, as we were anxious to have him here, because of his  Services as a Doctor, - he is our 'County Quarentine physcian.' We thought it proper to write you in regard to these matters - that you might  understand his circumstances; Nevertheless, we do not Question the wisdom of the call, If in the view of the Presidency, Bro Madsen's services in the Vineyard are required.  Praying the blessing of the Lord upon you, and his spirit to guide you, I remain your brother in the Gospel.  James S. Jensen, Bp. ENDENTRY Salina, Sevier Co, Dec. 17, 1890  Presdt Wilford Woodruff  Dear Bro. In answer to your inquiry made through Bro Geo Reynolds, concerning the "Missionary Call" of Bro Joseph Sorensen of this place, will say, that he was Called this spring, to perform a mission to New Zealand, but, was at that ^time^ unable to arrange his buisness, so as to leave at the time appointed, and on explaining this by letter to the "First Presidency", was given till fall, to arrange matters, and prepare for the mission; this he did; but did not  consider it his duty to acquaint you of the fact that he was ready, I advised him to write and inform you, but, "he was not going to beg for a mission"; hence, I wrote giving the information that, "Bro Sorenson, was ready for the  mission," and recd a reply from Bro Reynolds, Nov 18, that "no missionaries, were at present needed in New Zealand, and that his field of labour had been changed to the Southern States," and that the company of missionary Elders would leave Decr 17th. I was requested to inform Bro Sorensen of these facts.  I have done so, Bro Sorensen in consequence of my writing  to inform you of his being prepared, insists that I have called him, through Spite. Bro Sorensen is of a Family whose only hope of salvation, to all appearance, seems to be through him, as he is the only one who seems to take interest in the 'Work of God', but, he is not strong in the faith, and we thought, in his case, as in others, a 'mission' would be a great blessing to him, and, also, to the Sorensen Family, hence we sent in his name. We have three ^4^ returned missionaries,  young men who were called as he was, who beleived the   work, but had no positive testimony, who, since their  return, bear strong and faithful Testimonies, and are doing much good in the Ward.
