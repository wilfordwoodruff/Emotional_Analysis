[FIGURE] I met with The Presidency and Twelve at President  Youngs Office at about 12 oclok. The subjet of the Endowments & 2nd Anointings was presented when President Young said that the order of the 2nd anointing was for the persons to be anointed to be cloathed in their Priestly robes the man upon the right hand and wife or wifes upon the left hand. The Administrator may be dressed in his usual clothing or in his Priestly Robes as he may see fit. The meeting should be opened by Prayer then the Administrator should Anoint the man A King & Priest unto the Most High God. Then he should Anoint his wife or wives Queens & Priestess unto her husband. There should be but one man anointed at any one meeting. If more than one man is anointed in a day, They should come together and open by Prayer as though their had not been any meeting before and thus continue to the End.      Presidet Young said when a woman was Anointed a Queen to a good man and he died & the woman was sealed to another man for time it was not necessary for her to be anointed a Queen again but if she was Anointed a Queen to a man who was not worthy of a wife & she is sealed to another man she should be anointed a Queen unto him. When a good man dies & his wives have not been anointed Queens unto him they may be anointed Queens to him after his death without any Proxey.  In speaking of the Endowments President Young said that  all persons who wished strickly to observedthe law of  the Celestial Marriage should not get married untill  they get their Endowments & are sealed at the Altar  There may be instances whare persons are Aged & infirm     
 Dec 26 1866      and not Able to get to the Endowment House if they have   not had their Endowments may be sealed and in some insta-  nces I have given this permission & others have taken  the advantage of it & urged to be sealed without coming  to the Endowment House. I gave A Lyman the privilege of  sealing some in Sanbernadeno by his urgent request but it  will ^not^ avail any thing. Some may ask the question why  may we not seal & give Endowments abroad, because it   would destroy the object of the gathering. The People  should be gathered at head Quarters whare they can  be taught in the things of the kingdom of God & be under  the direction of the Priesthood. President Young said that  when Persons come to get their Endowments should be clean  & pure A man should not touch a woman for 10 days before  getting their Endowments and the Twelve while travelling  should hold meetings with the male members as priesthood  meetings & teach these but they have to handled in  wisdom or Evil will grow out of it      In speaking of the death of Joseph Smith the prophet  President Young said it was necessary for Joseph   Smith to shed his blood seal his Testimony with  his blood that his testimony might rest upon all  Nations that the wicked might be left without ecxcuse  in the day of Gods Judgments upon the wicked, if this   had not been the case he would not have been slain  in carthage jail. He sent away most of the Twelve  and a web was woven which brought about this Event  The subject of A sermon Preached by A Lyman  and published in the Millennium Star April 5, 1862,  in vol 24 was brought up & red & it was found to have  done away with the Efficasy of the blood of Christ President   B Young said he wished to know what the Twelve had to   say about it For he had a go[o]d deal to say about it  when you do away with the blood of the savior you  do away with all the Gospel & plan of Salvation. If  this doctrine as Preached by A Lyman & some by     
 Dec 26, 1866      O Pratt be preached & Published as the doctrine of  the Church & not contradicted by us it would not  be long before there would be syms [schysms] in the Church this  doctrin as Preached in this sermon is fals doctrin  if we do not believe that it wouldas necesary for  Christ to shed his Blood to save the world, whare is  our church it is nothing. This does not set well  upon my feelings. It is grievious to me to have the  Apostles teach fals doctrines. Now if the Twelve will  sit down quietly & not contradict such doctrines  are they justified no they are not      In speaking of our Temporal Position President Young   said if we could get up Female relief societies & they   would use their influence to get the sisters to make their   own bonnetts & make & wear their own Homemade   clothing it would do much good      President Young said as A Philosipher I wish to  ask a question is there any Reflection or thought upon  any thing that does not Exist I think there is      At the close of the meeting we made an Appointment to meet  at the Endowment House at 12 oclok      I met in the Evening with the Jordan dam company  in the council chamber, then went to President Youngs  office & red the minutes of the day      December 27, 1866 ~ Thursday      27.

($247.86)      Thus the year 1866 has closed, past away, and gone  and bourn its report to heaven of all men & Nations  1860 & 66 have been two years which many men have  looked forward to as being periods of vast importance  to the world. 1860, commenced the dissolving of  the American aUnion, the southern states seceded which  was followed by a 4 years war which laid in the dust  two millions of men, who were the strengs [strength] bone & sinnew  of the Nation, and cost the Northern states alone Four  thousand Million dollars and left upon the world all the  Evils which follow a Bloody civil war     
 1866, has been noted as a period of war beetween  the President Andrew Johnson, and the Congress   of the United States, and the increase of Dishonesty and   corruption not ownly throughout the United States but  throughout the known world. It seems as though there  never was a more wicked & corrupt Generation than  the one which we live. The whole Earth is ripened in  iniquity and prepared for the damnation of Hell. Many  of both people & rulers of this Nation are seaking to  destroy the Church and Kingdom of God from off  the Earth, and we are ownly preserved through the  power and Mercy of God. All Nations are preparing  for war, and are fearing and trembling for fear of those   things which are coming upon the Earth. There is an  awful uncertainty resting upon all Nations, but do not   know what awaits them. The Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter day Saints, the Zion of God, and the Kingdom  of God are all progressing in the mountains of Israel, the  wicked say let our Eye be upon Zion and let her be defi-  led, but they know not the thoughts of the Lord neither  understand they his ways. But the Saints of God understand  they that are faithful are looking for the judgments  of God to come upon the wicked, and for the coming of  the Son of Man. There has been more sin, wickedness,   and abominations, committed in the United States, and  throughout the Christian world during 1866 than in  fifty years a centeury ago. the whole Earth groans under  the sin and abominations which reigns upon the face  thereof. The Lord is withdrawing his spirit from the  wicked, and the devil rulses over them, and darkness  covors the Earth, and gross darkness the people. Wars and  rumoorrs of wars are among all people, and great judgments  await the wicked; while the righteous saints will stand in   Holy Places, and rejoice in the Lord their God, and the  Kingdom of our God will increase, and fill the whole Earth  and stand forever, and He will Reign whose right it is to Reign

 WILFORD WOODRUFF'S  JOURNAL  FOR  1867     
 January 1, 1867 ~ Tuesday      Jan 1st 1867      The year 1867 is before us, every year grows  more and more important in the great Events of the  Last days as we Approach nearer and nearer the  coming of the Son of Man. The Events of the last days  will be awful for the wicked, and Blessed for the righ[t]e-  ous. The Lord hath commenced a controversy with  the Nations and he will never cease untill that consu-  mption decreed will be fulfilled upon all the wicked  what 1867 will bring to pass time must determine, it  will hasten the downfall of our Nation, and Bring distress  upon other Nations. Mr Wade of Ohio has presented  a Bill to Congress got up by Judges Titus & Drake and  Ashly for the overthrow of the Mormons, Capt Hooper  our Delegate to Congress thinks it will pass Congress  but thinks the President will vetoe it. Speaker Colfax  is connected with them for the destruction of the  Church & kingdom of God from off the Earth.   I will watch those men & see what will be their   End. The Lord will fight the Battles of his saints  and he will destroy their Enemies, we may watch  the signs of the times. The Lord will preserve his  Saints and destroy the wicked. The wicked have  sought our destruction from the time Athe Angel of   God delivered into the Hands of Joseph Smith the  Prophet the Plates containing the record of the book  of Mormon. But the Lord Our God has so far preserved  us and will continue unto the End. Our trust is in   Him. I will watch & see what 1867 will bring forth  Let all the Saints be faithful and keep the commands  of God that his blessings may rest upon us. The Lord  hath never deserted his people but hath sustained   them who trust in him. Praise the Lord O my soul  and all that is within me praise his Holy Name, for  he hath sustained the seed of Abraham and upheld all  of his Anointed. May the Earth spedily be redeemed  that all the righteous may rejoice in the Holy One of Israel

I know why the blood of  Joseph, & Hiram & others have been shed and the blood  of others will be shed it is all to answer a purpose  and has its Effect Adam made this world and   suffered himself to take a body and subject himself  to sin that Redemption & Exaltation might come to  man. without descending below all things we cannot  asscend above all things.

There never was  a period but what worlds Exhisted & never will   be, and they all have the same Gospel & Law of   Salvation. Amasa Lyman is rejecting the Blood  of Christ has cut himself off from the Quorum  of the Twelve Apostles and he cannot be restored  to it in this probation.

To learn the Bible Book of Mormon & doctrin  & Covenants, & all good principles & the Deserett Alphabet  should be taught so that our children should understand.  3rd Our Young Ladies should be taught Business to attend  stores Telegraph Offices, &c 4th we want 500 teams to   come & draw 3 loads of Rock each so that we may build  the Temple they should have a waggon that will draw  8000 lbs & with 5 yoak of good oxen. 5th we want  100 young Men to go on a Mission to Dixie  6th All young Men & Madens old Enough to Marry are  required to Marry & fulfill the Law of God.

Let the people lay up their wheat as they have been told for  years. 8th Let the people learn the Law of Life how to live  At the close of his remarks John Taylor spoke 32 M[inutes]  9. text let the Elders preach what they know & not tell  what they do not know & speculate on what would have   been had Adam not sined, had Christ not died, had   the world not been made &c for you know Nothing  about it. W Woodruff Followed & spoke 15 Minutes &   [FIGURE] said when I Entered this Tabernacle yesterday morning  & gazed upon the vast sea of Fases for a few mo[me]nts   I could hardly tell whether I was in a vision or  whether it was a reality what I saw but I was soon conv  inced that I stood in the Great Tabernacle of our God  in which was Assembled some 6 or 8000 of the Latter day   Saints. we have had given us a certain Number   of text to preach from I consider it the duty of   the Elders to pay attention to these subjects when given  to them 1st was the Emigration. The Lord has gathered  us from the Nations through ^the gospel of^ of Christ He requires us  to do all we can to gather the poor Saints from the Nations  of the Earth it is our duty to impart of our substance for that purpose     
 Oct 7th 1867      2nd The Education of our children. This is of vast importance  to our children the duty resting upon mothers is vary   great, when does the Education of children begin. I will   not tell you what ^you^ Believe about it or any one Els But I  will tell you what I Believe about it & that is I Believe   that the Education of the child Begins the day that the   Spirit of Life from God Enters into the Tabernacle & as  the Mother is so will be the Child if the Mother is full of  faith, prayer, & the spirit of God quiet & contented so   will be her child if she is cross Fretful & discontented  it will Effect her child & after its Birth the Example   set Before the child will Effect it through life, & the   Education of the child or man will Never End untill the  spirit leaves the Body & it will then continue to learn Forever  & Forever. Mothers should teach there children to obey   their Father & to obey carry out his orders in all things  concerning their Every day duties. If the Mother tells her   child as soon as the Fathers Back is turned Now your  Father is gone you may go & pick those Apples & grapes  or do any thing Els the Father has told them not to do the  Mother in such a course will make thieves of their children  & ruin them The Mother should sustain the Father in  the government of the children, then they will all be Blessed  together They should be taught to read the Bible Book of Mormon  & doctrins & Covenats all good Books & let Novels alone  3rd Ladies taught Business, This is right & proper &  Ladies should be taught telegraphing & storekeeping & all   such light work & let men do the Heavy work  4th 500 teams wanted to dray rock. if the people value  the Blessings of the Holy Priesthood as they should they will  never withhold the building of that temple  5 The Missionaries called to go South our Brethren may  as well be in Dixie as in England as long as they are doing  the will of God      6. The Young People are required to Marry & multiply  and replenish the Earth. This is the commandment of     
 Oct 7, 1867      of God And I wish to say to the Young Ladies when the  young Brethren make proposals of Marriage to them dont ask  them how many carriages they have got or how much gold  & silver, but ask are they virtueous, honest, industrious  are they saints & willing to obey council if so marry  them & God will bless you. all the requirements in property  I have herd was that they should have 3 straw beds all   but the ticks. 7. Lay up your wheat I do not feel that  a great deal is necessary to be said upon this subject. I   think the visitation of the grass hoppers another year will  cause us all to lay up wheat if we can get it without much preaching  8. Learn to keep the law of Life. This is an important   subjet I think we shall have to change our maner of  life in many things. But I feel that President Young is  better qualified to teach this principle than I am  9. & Last Elders teach what you know & not tell what   would would have been if Christ had not died, & Adam  feel, & if the world had not been made &c. I have always  had more of the spirit of God in preaching the first princi-  ples of the Gospel & testifying that Joseph was a prophet of God  & the Book of Mormon true than in preaching many   Misteries when a Man goes into misteries he is in  the swamp & does not know what he is doing      G A Smith spoke 7 Minutes & dismissed      October 8, 1867 ~ Tuesday      Oct 8.

In ordaining   a man into the Quorum of the Twelve I have omited   to appoint one man to take the place of Another, or to take   his crown. one man cannot take the crown of another  Evry man must wear his own crown if he has one  Thomas B Marsh once was the President of the Quorum of  the Twelve I now occupy that place I certainly would  not like to take or wear Brother Marsh's crown  (G. A. Smith says Neither would I) Each one will have his  own crown if he has one at all, & not the crown of another  Evry man will be rewarded according to the life he lives  Joseph Fielding Smith has been ordained an Apostle  & is now Appointed one of the Quorum of the Twelve. he  will not take Amasa Lymans place or crown but  his own. Brother Joseph has been on Missions is a good man   & is worthy of a good crown. I have officiated in   ordaining sixteen of the Twelve Apostles, there is a crown   for Evry good man, and a Man will not have but one  & I do not want any mans but my own.

 January 24, 1868 ~ Friday      Jan 24, 1868      I spent the forenoon in the Legislature & Afternoon I attended   the school of the Prophets Speeches were made By Brigham Young,  H. C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, John Taylor, ^&^ Wilford Woodruff  [FIGURE] W Woodruff I feel thankful for the privilege of speaking a   few words to this school. I wish to refer to the first doctrin preached   that Adam was our Father & God in the Revelation called the   ollive leaf it says that "the Devil gathered together the Hosts  of Hell And Michael the Arkangel gathered together the Hosts of   Heaven and he overcame the devil & his Angels & this is the   Battle of the Godreat God" who is this Michael the Ark Angel  it is Adam who was Michael in the creation of the World.  Again in regard to the redemption of the dead I believe it will   take all the ordinances of the gospel of Christ to save soul as   much as another. Jesus himself obeyed all the ordinances  of the Gospel that he might fulfill all righteousness. Therefore  those who have died without the gospel will have to receive the   gospel in the spirit world from those who preach to the   spirit in Prision, & those who dwell in the flesh will have to   attend to all the ordinances of the gospel for & in their behalf  by Proxy & it will take 1000 years with Jesus Christ at the head  of all the Prophets & Apostles before the work will be finished in  attending to all the ordinances for all the dead who have died  without the gospel. Again con[cer]ning Revelation I Believe  it to be the privilege of Evry Apostle & Elder who bears any   portion of the Holy Priesthood to have the Holy Ghost &   Revelation to guide them in all things. But I do not Believe  that the Lord will Reveal to any man a New Principle, doctrin  or Law, to govern the Chu[r]ch & kingdom of God on the Earth  Except through the Mouth of the Prophet, Seer, Revelator  President & Law given unto the Church, this is his place  & position to receive the word of the Lord & give it unto the   people. There are some keys [FIGURE] which the Prophet Joseph  held which No other man held while he lived. & there are some   which President Brigham Young holds which No other Man holds  the keys of the sealing power for instance But he permits other  Apostles to administer in this ordinance     
 Jan 24, 1868      Again their is another subject I wish to speak off. There is  one subject upon my mind & has been for years that is contra-  ry to my Practice & the Practice of this People & that is corncerning  the sabbath I have never thought that the Jews or ten Tribes  of Israel would Ever keep the gentile Sabbath that is the first   day of the week when I was Baptized into this Church I   was keeping Saturday for the Sabbath. But I knew that   the Later day saints were the tru Church of Christ & if I   had imbibed 100 tradition I would have given them up for   this I dont know as the Latter Day Saints will Ever keep  this day & it does not make any difference whether they do  or not for the Lord will dictate them Just as he please in  all those things. But when Moses received this comm-  andment to keep the seventh day of the week The Lord [said] this   Law shall remain as a statute Betwen me & the House  of Israel forever throughout all your Generation I   have Never found this commandment changed By any  revelation from God. [##Exodus 20:8-11##] Jesus & the Apostles kept the 7 day of  the week called the Jewish Sabbath. Yet the Apostles  did meet in some Instances on the first day of the week  to Break bread &c. Constantine changed the day of   worship from the seventh to the first day of the week   about 600 years after Christ, we received a Revelation  in the doctrins & covents in the Early age of this Chirch  to Meet upon the Lords day to Break Bred &c. But the Lord  did not reveal which day of our time was the Exact diy  that the Lord Commanded Israel to keep. At the close of  the remarks. President Young read the revelation and   said that there had been so much change in time that  we do not know the Exact time that was the seventh day  President Young made many remarks upon various subjects      January 25, 1868 ~ Saturday      25 [FIGURES] I spent the fore part of the day in the Endowment House  we gave Endowments to 46.

 Aug 22nd 1868      and inspired of God to Preach the gospel of Christ & could   tell me the true way to be saved now as we travel through the coun-  try we meet thousands of children as well as men & women who  can see Prophets Apostles & Elders by merly walking a few rods  into the streets to greet President Young, the Twelve & others as  we travel through the country it is a good thing for these chil-  dren to come out in procession to Greet the President as he com-  es along through through the country for it will make a good   impression upon there minds one that they will never forget  when these Boys & girls meet to gether thirty years hence   in 1898 & convers to gether upon the scenes of this visit  what will be their conversation it will be sumthing like   the following O what a great change has taken place  since the Prophet Brigham Young & the Apostles visited us in  Logan in 1868 Then it was a New Country with but  few inhabitants not more than ten thousand People in all Cash   Valley, then we had No Tabernacle or Temple in this valley  Now we have a great Tabernacle & a great Temple built  on the high Bench of Logan & we can be drawn on the top  of its Towers by machinery whare we can view the glory  of this valley filled with cities & magnificet Palaces &  Towers occupied by one Million of the Saints of God who  can come up to the Temple on Logan Bench & get their   Endowments & Blessings in their turn. Then our fields  of grain & garden were half sunflowers & weed since  then by the commandment of God no man occupies more  land then he can keep clean of weeds & beautify, then  we had no shade trees in our streets, now our streets  ar adorned with the mulbury tree from which we make  our silk which now adorns our Bodies & the Bodies of our   children then the Apostle E T Benson & Bishop Maughn  Presided over us, since then they have gone with  President Young to& others to Jackson Co Mo to Build the  great Temple & the New Jerrusalem This visit was in  1868 then we were children now it is 1898 & great   changes have taken place since that day throughout     
 Aug 22nd 1868      Great Babylon as well as in Mount Zion that year was  the great Election for the Presidency of the United States   Grant & Colfax were the Candidates for the Black Repullin   & Seymour & Blair for the Dimocratts, then the Nation   felt strong & Powerful since then it has been broken to peaces  That visit was before the destruction of the City of New   York By the Sea Heaving itself beyong its bounds & washing   the inhabitants into the Sea & they were drowned. It was   Before Albany was utterly Destroyed by fire It was before  Boston was sunk with an Earthquake. It was before  Chicago was struck with lightning & burned with fire &   Brimstone for their Abominations. It was before the many   Millions of the UniPeople of the United States & other Nations   of the Earth were destroyed bywith their Cities By the   Great Judgments of God Because of their great sins &   wickedness in the sight of Heaven & Earth, this was Before the  United States became so weakened & Broaken to peaces that  they called upon Brigham Young to take the Presidency of   the United States to save the Constitution & the remnant of   the Nation from utter destruction. If this will not be   the conversation of those little children 30 ho who were   in the procession with their Banners to welcome the prophet  & Apostles on their Enterance into this City, thirty years   from this it will be sumthing like it.

Kimballs Remarks  He said Vilate & I have lived together 46 years and I have left     
 The Funeral of Vilate M Kimball Oct 24 1867      Her many times to go & preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I bid  her good By as much then as I have now. I did this in Zions Camp  also when I went to England & at different times. She has been  true to me always and never left Nor forsook me. I have taken  40 wives & many without her knowledge but she afterwards gave  them to me in the Temple. She has passed through many trials  but she has been always true to me. When Vilate was first taken  sick the spirits took the advantage of her. When I went to lay   hands upon her I saw a Devil in the room meeting me & I saw  it several times. I felt indignant by the spirit of God, there is   many fals spirits that are trying to destroy our children, and  will destroy all they can. We should strive to overcome them  she sympathized with me untill her last Breath. Br Brigham &  I have stood By Joseph unto the End, & he will never forsake  or forget us No never. No more than God will forget his ownly  Begotten Son. The foregoing is ownly a synopsis of his remarks  Farewell all Earthly honors was then sung & J Taylor Dismissed  The Following is a synopsis of remarks of President Brigham Young  at the commencement of the Funeral of Vilate Kimball He was the first  speaker. He said when I buried my first wife I do not think  there was a tear shed, and it is a great victory gained to overcome  the death & the grave & have a glorious resurrection The good often  suffer as well as the wicked we suffer in the Flesh but when we   die & the spirit leaves the Body The Devil & Evil has No more  power over us When the spirits of the righteous Enter the spirit world  they are Beyond the power of the Devil. The knowledge, which the  Latter Day Saints have obtained have put us in possession of power  which the world has not. We live not for this world alone but  for the resurrection. There is^are^ man^y^ in this room who have done  the Best they could They would not wish to try it over again  where does Vilate go when this Body is laid off She is in the  presence of God not whare his Tabernacle is but have his presence  in spirit & we can see all things that we wish or desire to see  we are as much in the presence of God in this City as though we  were with him in person I do not know whether Vilate is  with us in this room or not but we have good spirits with us     
 The Funeral of Vilate Kimball Oct 24 1867      and we feel themir influence. We also have all the devils that  fall from Heaven & wicked men to contend with but whare,  those spirits have power on a person they Effect the body  but does it take any Glory from Vilate because of her affliction  No not in the least she will have a greater reward. She has  not Been afflicted because of sins, But Because the devil  has power on her body & some in this City who cherish Evil  spirits & devils they try to destroy the ignorant Vilate will  come forth with her body & will stand at the Head of this   Family & Heber at her head as he has here & this will be  the case with all who are good. Now we should prepare  ourselves to go as well as Vilate has. let us be faithful   till we hear the Trump sound. I Expect Joseph Smith  will be the first man resurrected then He will resurrect  his family Just when he pleases & if we live so as to come  forth in the first Resurrection we shall rejoice to all Eternity  President Joseph Young spoke a few moments It was a solem  time At the close of the funeral the Body was removed to the   Family Grave of Brother Kimball      [One Line Blank]      October 26, 1868 ~ Monday      Oct 26, 1868 To day was quite a serious day I was quite  [FIGURE] Feble in health and about noon my Indian Boy  Sarokeets came up from the field & had quit his work &  had left the Cane Mill with No one to Feed it & they  were Boiling Molasses & had not help Enough so they set  my little son Asahel ownly 5 years old to feed the mill  so while feeding he got his right hand caught in the rollers  He hallowed & the Mule instantly stoped & the Mill   rolled back but still it smashed about one half of his hand his  Mother Emma & Wilford took him into the waggon & came to   the City as soon as they could, they came to Dr Olmsby, & while  I was talking to Keets Wilford drove up & informed me of the accident  that had happened to Asahel I immediately went to the  docters & there found the Boy with his hand in a dredful  condition we gave him cloraform & it took about one hour  to dress his hand it took off his Thumb & two fingers But

 History of Wilford Woodruff concluded  heading for printers    Chapter of Accidents  written G. S. L. City February, 1858    Varied and diverse are the lives and fortunes  of men, while the paths of some are strewen with   flowers and ease from the cradle to the grave  with naught to disturbe their peace, others apparen  tly are marked victims of variated misfortunes,   accidents, and dangers; the last named class is   the one, in whose ranks I have stoood stood, thro'  my infancy, childhood, youth & manhood, up to   the present time, so ^much so,^ that it has seemed as though   some invisaible power or fate was watching my   ^foot^steps, in order to find some opportunity to take   my life from the earth; I can only attribute   the continuation of my life on Earth to the present   time, to a merciful God, whose hand has been   stretched out and rescued me from death in   the midst of many ^of the^ many dangers and hair breadth   escapes, I have passed through, some of   which I will here mention. When 3 years of age   I fell into a caldron of boiling water, was instantly   caught out, but was so badly scalded, that it was   nine months fbefore I was considered out of   danger. When at 5 years of age, I fell from the great   beam of a barn rafters ^striking^ my bare face upon the   floor, which came near breaking my neck. Three   months afterwards, I broke one of my arms, by falling   down a pair of stairs; I soon after broke my other   arm by falling out of a high stoop, upon a pile   of timber. When six years of age, I came near   being killed by a surly Bull. ^see people apart^ and was only saved  by as it were by a miracle, ^¶^ dDurring the same year, I went into my fathers saw mill, with several   others. I got upon the headblock to take a ride   while the carriage was running back, not anticipating   any danger, but before I was aware, my leg was caught 
 between the headblock and the fender post, and broke   both bones of my leg below the knee. I was taken to the   house and lay nine hours before my bones were   set, which time was spent amidst ^suffering severe pain, but   being young my bones soon knitt together and in   a few days, I was again upon my feet; during   my confinement, by this lameness, my bro., Thompson,   was my companion in the same room going through with   a course of the typhus fever. When 7 years of age, I was   riding on the top of a load of hay, which my uncle,  Ozen Woodruff, was driving to the barn, he turned   the load over upon me. I was nearly strangled for   the want of air, before the hay was removed. ^¶^At 8   years of age ^old^ I was riding in a one horse wagon with   several others, the horse took fright ran down a   steep hill and turned the wagon over upon us; but   again while in the midst of danger my life was pre-  served; none of us were seriously injured. When 9 years   ^old^ I climbed into an elm tree to obtain bark. I stepped upon   a dry limb, which broke and I fell about 15 feet upon   my back which beat the breath out of my body, a cousin   ran and told my parents I was dead; before they   arrived at the spot, I came to my senses and met   my parents ^them^ coming to me. When 12 years of age   I was drownd in Farmington Rriver, and sunk   in 30 ft of water, and after carrying one person   to the bottom with me, I was miraculously saved   by a young man named Bacon by diving to the   bottom, and carrying with him a large stone, to holld hold   him down until he obtained my body, not expecting   to save my life ^me alive^: I suffered much in being restored to   life: ^at 13 years of age^ While passing through Farmington meadows, in the   depth of winter, the roads were drifted with snow, and in   an exceedingly blustering day I became so chilled and 
 overcome with cold, ^so that^ I could not travel. I crawled   into the hollow of a large apple tree a man in the   distance seeing me go into ^it^ the tree hastened to my   rescue, realizing my danger more fully than I did  when he arrived at the spot I had fallen asleep and   was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty in arousing   me to a sense of my situation, he procured means   to carry me to my father's house, and through   a kind providence my life was again preserved.   At 14 years of age, I split my left instep open with an ax   which went nearly through my foot; and it was 9 months getting   well. At 15 year of age, I was bitten in my left hand   by a mad dog in the last stage of hydrophobia; he only   dented my hand with his teeth but did not draw blood &   I was again preserved through the mercies of God   from an awful death. At the age of 17, I met  with an accident which caused me much suffering  and came near ending my life, I was riding a   very ill tempered horse, which I was not acquainted   with, and while going down a very steep ^rocky^ hill, the   horse took the ^taking^ advantage of the ground, suddenly   leaped from the ground ^road^, and ran down the   steepest part of it ^the hill^, amid the roughest of the rocks   at full speed, and commenced kicking up at   the same time, and attempted to throw me over   his head upon the rocks, but I lodged upon the top   of his head grasped hold of each ear, as with   a death grasp, expecting every moment to be dashed   to pieces among ^against^ the rocks, while in this position   sitting astride of his neck with no bridle to guide   him but his ears, he plunged down the hill under   full speed until he ran against a rock, which ^and^  dashed him to the ground. I went over both his head on   and the rock, about one rod, and struck the ground   square on my feet, being the only thing visible that 
 saved my life, for had I struck upon any other part   of my body, it must have killed me instantly, as it was   my bones crushed from under me as though they were   reeds, it broke my left leg twice in two places and   put out both my ankles in a shocking manner  and the Horse came near rolling over me in his   struggles to get up; my uncle, Titus Woodruff, saw   me fall got assistance me and carried me to his house  I lay from 2 O'clock ^pm^ till 10 at night without medical aid   then my Father arrived bringing Dr Swift of Farmington   with him who set my bones boxed up my limbs and carried   me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my fathers;  my sufferings were very great yet I had good attention   and in 8 weeks I was out doors upon my crutches.   In 1827 while attempting to clear the ice out of a   water wheel; standing upon the wheel with one arm   around the shaft; a man hoisted the gate and   let a full head of water upon it, as soon as the   water struck the wheel it ^the wheel^ it started, my feet slipped into the wheel   I immediately plunged head long foremost over the   rim of the wheel into about 3 feet of water and my   weight drew my legs out of the wheel, or I should   have been drawn under a shaft and crushed to   death. In 1831 while having charge of the flouring   mill in Collinsville Ct. I was standing inside of a breast   wheel 20 ft. in diameter, upon one of the arms near the   top, clearing out the ice, when a full head of water   was let on to it, it immediately started; but I droped my   ax and leaped through the wheel to the bottom of it, by   the shaft and arms about 20 feet: as I struck the bottom   of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone   wall with only about 2 feet of water clearance   between it and the wheel, the wheel caught me and   rolled me out into the water below where I found myself   with-out any bones broken, but with some bruses and much fright. 
 During the winter of 1831, while in New hartford, Ct.   I passed through a severe fit of sickness course of   lung fever. In 1833, the day I was baptized into the church  of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints; one of my horses, newly   caught ^sharp shod^, kicked my hat off my head and had he struck   2 inches lower, would probably have killed me instantly,   in 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same team   down a hill on a sleigh without any box the bottom   boards slipped forward under the roller and caught   the ground, turned end ways and fell on the horses'   backs, ^throwing me between^ between the horses, they ran to the bottom of the   hill dragging me by ^with^ the lines, head foremost with   the sleigh on top of me about 20 rods over a smooth   snow path, I escaped unharmed however, in the   midst of both dangers. In 1834 while traveling in   Zion's camp in Mo. a rifle was accidentally discharged   and the ball passed through 3 tents with about 12 men   in each, and lodged in a wagon axletree while a   man was standing behind it, it ^and^ injured no one   ^it^ passed within a few inches of my breast, and many   others escaped as narrowly as myself: a few months   afterwards a musket heavily loaded with buckshot was accidentlally snapped   with the muzzle pointed at my breast within a few  few feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot, it   had a good flint and ^was^ well primed, but it missed fire   and my life was a gain preserved. In April 1839   in Rochester Ills. I was riding upon the running   gears of a wagon without a box, I was sitting upon   the forward axletree, the bolt came out, fastening   the copuling pole, which left the hind wheels, and   my weight on the forward bolster and tongue  turned the copuling pole, clear over onto the   horses backs, turned the stakes upside down 
 and shut me up fast, ^between the bolster and tongue^ but in such a manner   that my head and shoulders dragged on the ground   my horses took fright and ran out into an open   prairie and thus dragged me in this possession ^position^   for about half a mile. I managed to guide them   with my left hand, so as to run them into a corner ^of a high worm^  of the fence, where we landed in a pile together. I was   considerably bruised but escaped without any broken bones.   On the 23rd July 1842 Prest Joseph Smith sent   me to S from Nauvoo to St. Louis to procure a   stock of paper. I went down upon a steamboat was   6 days on the way, during which time I was severely   attacked with billious fever. The day I made my   purchase, the fever was so high I was scarcely sensible   of what I was doing, as soon as I made my   purchase, and got my freight on board, I took my   birth and lay there until I arrived at Nauvoo, which  was on the 10 of Aug.st. I was confined to my bed 40   days and passed through the most severe fit of   sickness I ever endured, my life was dispaired   of by many of my friends; I was administered   to by Prst Smith and the Twelve: my life was   preserved by the power of God. I took a relapse   twice after I began to recover, once while in council   with the Presidency & Twelve, my strengths left me   my breath stoped and I felt as though I was   struck with death.   On the 12th Sept 12, 1843 I left At 5 o'clock p.m. I   left Boston, on the express train for Portland  while passing through Chester woods 6 miles south [of]   Kennebunk some person having pried up ^raised^ the ^one of the^ rails  and put under them ^rolled^  a log, ^under it^ and it being dark  the we struck it at full speed and landed in  a pile of ruins. 3 cars were filled with passengers 
 and their lives were saved, by having a long   train of freight between the passenger cars and the   engine, which ^all of them^ were mashed to pieces, the engineer   was killed, some of the passengers had bones broken   I escaped unhurt.   On the 5th day of Oct 1846, while with the Camp   of Israel building up winter quarters on the west   side of the Missouri river, (then Indian country,) I   passed through one of the most painful and serious   misfortunes I ever of any of my life I took my axe   and went two and a half miles on to the bluffs, to   cut some shingle timber to cover my shanty cabin   I was accompanied by two other men and while   falling the 3rd trees ^was falling^ which was an oak over 2 ft   diameter I stepped behind it some 10 feet, and also   to one side the same distance, where I thought I   was entirely out of danger, but when the tree fell   there being a crook in the body of it, ^which^ struck a knoll   on the ground when the whole body shot endways   back of the stump and bounded, and the butt of the   tree struck me on the breast, and knocked me several   feet into the air, ^against a standing oak^ and the falling tree followed me   in its bound and caught me against the standing   tree and I came down between the them, before   reaching the ground I was liberated from them   and struck the ground upon my feet, badly bru^i^sed   my left thigh the whole length of it and my hip   also ^and^ my left arm, it also broke my breast bone   also 3 ribs on my left side also bruised my lungs,   vitals and left side were also bruised in a shocking manner.   after the accident I sat upon a log until Mr  Mo Garrison went a quarter of a mile to get my   horse; notwithstanding I was so badly hurt I had 
 Nauvoo August 1st 1840  had to mount^ed^ my horse and ride ^rode^ 2 1/2 miles, over a  very rough road and had to dismount^ed^ twice  in consequence of miry places, my breast and  vitals were so badly torn to pieces that at each step of  the horse the pain went through me ^like an^ arrow; I continued  on horse back until I arrived at Turkey Creek  on the north side of Winter Quarters I then became  exhausted and was taken off my horse and  carried to my wagon in a chair; I was met in  the street by Prests Brigham Young, H. C. Kimball  & W. Richards and others who assisted in carrying  me to ^my^ family; before laying me upon my bed, the  Presidency laid hands upon me rebuked my  suffering and distress in the name of the  Lord, and said I should live and not die, I   was then laid upon my bed in my wagon  and as the Apostles prophesied upon my head  so it came to pass. I did live and not die. I   employed no physician on this occasion but  was administered to by the Elders of Israel  and nursed by my Wife. I lay upon my bed  unable to move, until my breast bone began  to knit together, which commenced on the 9th  day, I began to walk about in 20 days in  30 days from the time I was hurt, I again  commenced to do hard labor.    On the 21st day of April 1856, I innoculated  my arms with poison and mortification ^ensued^; while  assisting to remove an ox that had died from  poison and had been skinned; the poison worked  through my system for seven days before it  showed itself outwardly. on the 28 my arm began   to swell, was in great pain and showed signs 
 of mortification I showed it to Prest. Young who advised  me to cleanse my stomach immediately and put  on onion poultices and any thing that would draw  the poison from my system into my arm, which  I counsel I immediately put into execution. the  29th was another trying day to my life, the poison  had so thoroughly penetrated my whole system that  my strength left me I could not stand, I was led  to my bed, my bowels and stomach ceased to  act, my speech was like that of a drunken man  Prest. Young called into company with Dr Sprague  and laid hands upon me and rebuked the disease  and the power of the distroyer which had sceized  my body and promised me in the name of the  Lord, that I should not die but live to finished  my work which was appointed me, upon the  Earth. I soon began to recover; the poison and  mortification left my body system and centered  in my arm, and was drawn from my arm  through the aid of charcoal poultices, moistened  with a strong decoction of wormwood rag weed  and wild sage; the dead flesh was removed  from my arm with instruments and lunar caustic  and in a few days I was well again.    I have occupied considerable space in refering  to those peculiar circumstances, which have attended  me during life, and to sum the matter up, it stands  thus: I have broken both legs, one twice in two ^in two places^, both  arms, both ankles, ^dislocated^ my breast bone and three ribs, ^and ^had^ both ankles dislocated^  I have been drown^e^d, froze, scalded, and bit by  a mad dog; have been in two water wheels under  full head of water; have passed through several  severe fits of sickness; & encountered poison in its  worst forms; have landed in a pile of rail-road ruins 
 have barely been missed a ^the^ passing bullet, and  have passed through a score of other hair-breadth  escapes. It has appeared miraculous to me, that  with all the injuries and broken bones, which  I have met with ^had^; I have not a lame limb about  me, but have been enabled to endure the hardest  labor, exposures and journeys, have often  walked 40, 50, and on one occasion 60 miles in a  day. The protection and mercy of God has been  over me and my life thus far has been preserved  for which blessings I feel to render the gratitude  of my heart to my Heavenly Father; praying  that the remainder of my days may be  spent in his service and in the building up  of his Kingdom. 
 August 1832 a continuance of the foreerding subject  I have hastily noticed in the foregoing pages some of the leading circumstances  of my life, up to the time of my entering the ranks of the Servants of   God. In looking it over I find many imperfections but as it was written  some time since and in great haste I shall let it remain for the  present and continue my narrative begginning where I  left off       When I entered the ranks of Gods people and first commenced  the Christians warfare I had but faint ideas of the narrowness  of that Way, and but little realized that it was as strait a  way as the scriptures represent it to be, that but few should  find & walk in it. Much less did I in my weakness conceive  the many artful & cunning devices of Satan to draw the  child of God from the paths of holiness I had not yet learnt  by experience that the Devil like a roaring Lion goeth about  seeking whom he may devour and that he grasps with his  deadly claws every one that turns aside from the Highway  of Holiness. But as I turned and set my face Zion ward and  began to take up my march thither I soon began to hear  the — at first but whispered suggestions of the Adversary trying to  win me back to his service and I soon began to feel his firey  darts levelled and hurled at me from almost every quarter  I soon found that I had enlisted as a Soldier in a warfare  and that I must act not only the offensive but likewise  the defensive part and if I would gain the prize I must  fight. But I had yet (as a raw undiciplined recruit) to learn the  use of the armour with which Christians fight their battles  and from whom I could expect help from trouble      I could not wield with ease the Sword of the Spirit and the  Shield of Faith though a comfortable garment ^& armour^, did not fit  my body Shapen and conceive in Sin, in fine the garments  of Salvation could not be expected to fit perfectly, and set  with ease on one who had so long been clothed with shame  and clad with the filthy garments of Unrighteousness  But I had yet to learn of My Captain, of Him who is meek  and lowly some simple & humble lessons of Christianity  before I could make much resistance with the enemy  in case of an open attack. Encouraging thought that  the Captain of our Salvation being in all points tempted  as we are is able to succour those that are tempted  and that he will with every temptation provide  a way for our escape     
 (Continued from page 168.)  HISTORY   OF   WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      At an early age my mind was exer-  cised upon religious subjects, although  I never made a profession until 1830.   I did not then join any church, for  the reason that I could not find any   denomination whose doctrines, faith  or practice, agreed with the Gospel of   Jesus Christ, or the ordinances and   gifts which the Apostles taught.   Although the ministers of the day   taught that the faith, gifts, graces,   miracles and ordinances, which the   ancient Saints enjoyed, were done  away and no longer needed, I did not   believe it to be true, only as they   were done away through the unbelief   of the children of men. I believed   the same gifts, graces, miracles and   power would be manifest in one age of   the world as in another, when God had   a Church upon the earth, and that the   Church of God would be re-established  upon the earth, and that I should live  to see it. These principles were rivet-  ed upon my mind from the perusal   of the Old and New Testament, with   fervent prayer that the Lord would  show me what was right and wrong,   and lead me in the path of salvation,  without any regard to the opinions of  man; and the whisperings of the Spirit  of the Lord for the space of three   years, taught me that he was about to   set up his Church and kingdom upon   the earth in the last days. I was  taught these things from my youth by   Robert Mason, an aged man, who   lived in Simsbury, Conn., who was  frequently called the old prophet   Mason. He taught me many things   which are now coming to pass. He   did not believe that any man had   authority to administer in the ordi-  nances of the Gospel, but believed it  was our privilege, through faith, prayer   and fasting, to heal the sick and cast   out devils by the laying on of hands,   which was the case under his admini-  stration, as many could testify.      In 1832, I was inspired to go to   Rhode Island; my brother, Asahel,  was also directed by the Spirit of God  to go to the same place. When we  met, we both told our impressions,  and it caused us to marvel and wonder  what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode  Island; but, as we had made prepara-  tions to move to the west, we let out-  ward circumstances control us, and,  Jonah like, instead of going to Rhode  Island, we went to Richland, Oswego   county, New York, and there remained   until Dec. 29, 1833, when I heard El-  ders Zerah Pulsipher and Elijah    Cheeny preach. My brother Azmon  and I believed their testimony, enter-  tained the Elders, and offered our-  selves for baptism the first sermon we  heard. We read the Book of Mor-  mon, and I received a testimony that  it was true.      We soon learned what the Lord   wanted of us in Rhode Island, for at  the time we were warned to go there,   two of the Elders were preaching there,   and had we gone, we should have em-  braced the Work at that time.      Dec. 31—I was baptized by Elder   Zerah Pulsipher; he confirmed me the   same evening.      Jan. 2, 1834—I was ordained a   Teacher, and my brother Azmon an     
 Elder, and a small Branch organized  of twelve members, by Elder Pulsi-  pher.      In February following, in company   with Elder Holton, I walked some  sixty miles to the town of Fabius, to   attend an evening meeting of the   Saints in that place, where Elder Pul-  sipher was presiding. I saw the book   of commandments or revelations given   through Joseph Smith, and I believed   them with all my heart, and rejoiced   therein; and after spending several  days, and holding several meetings,   we returned home rejoicing.      During the winter, we were visited   by several of the Elders. Feb. 1st.,  Elder Parley P. Pratt called upon us   and instructed the Branch till mid-  night; we had a precious time. I   accompanied brother Pratt to Jeffer-  son county, and told him my circum-  stances; he said it was my duty to   prepare myself to go to Kirtland, and   join the Camp of Zion. I immedi-  ately settled my business.      April 11, 1834—With my horses   and wagon, I took brothers Harry   Brown and Warren Ingles, and started   for Zion. I met with Orson Pratt,  John Murdoch and other Elders, on   the way, and arrived in Kirtland on   the 25th day of April, 1834.      The Prophet Joseph invited me to  make his house my home; I accepted   his offer, and staid with him about   one week. I became acquainted with   many of the High Priests, Elders and  Saints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirt-  land, and heard many of the Elders  speak, and I felt to rejoice before God   for the light and knowledge which was   manifested to me during that day.      May 1—I started from Kirtland,  and went to New Portage and re-  mained till all the company joined   us, when we were organized.      March [May] 7—We took up our line of   march, pitched our tents by the way,   and travelled to Missouri.      After we had pitched our tents in   Clay county, (our numbers being 205)   and many of the brethren had taken   sick, and some had died, Joseph re-  quested the camp to disperse, except   enough to take care of the sick. All  who had teams were required to leave   the ground and go among the bre-  thren. I went to brother Lyman  Wight's, in company with Heman   Hyde and Milton Holmes. Shortly,   Joseph called the brethren together at   Lyman Wight's, and told them if they  would humble themselves before the  Lord, and covenant to keep His com-  mandments and obey His counsel, the   plague should be stayed from that  hour, and there should not be another   case of cholera in the Camp. The   brethren covenanted to do this, and   the plague was stayed, and there was   not another case in Camp.      President Joseph Smith returned to  Kirtland with many of the brethren;  I remained with Lyman Wight, labor-  ing with my hands till the following   winter.      I had a great desire to preach the   Gospel, which I did not name to my   brethren; but one Sunday evening I   retired into the woods alone, and   called upon the Lord in earnest prayer,   to open my way to go and preach the   Gospel to the inhabitants of the earth.   The Spirit of the Lord bore witness   that my prayer was heard, and should   be answered. I arose from my knees  happy, and walked some forty rods,   and met Elias Higbee, a High Priest,  with whom I had staid a number of   months. As I approached him, he   said, "Brother Wilford, the Spirit of  the Lord tells me that you should be   ordained, and go on a mission." I re-  plied, "I am ready."      At a meeting of the High Council at   Lyman Wight's, Clay county, Mis-  souri, Nov. 5th, I was ordained a   Priest by Elder Simeon Carter; Ste-  phen Winchester and Heman T. Hyde   were also ordained Priests.      Bishop Partridge said he would like   to have me go into the Southern States,   through Arkansas, Tennessee and Ken-  tucky; and if I could find any body   who had faith enough to go with me—  for it would be a dangerous country  to travel in, in consequence of the   Missouri persecutions—to take him.  I told him I was as ready to go south   as anywhere, and asked if I should go  through Jackson county, as it lay in  our route. He replied, it would be at   the risk of life, and he had not faith   enough to undertake it; if I had, I   might try it. I also asked him, if I   went through Jackson county, if I  should start without purse or scrip,     
 according to the law of God. He   answered, that he had not faith enough  to start on a mission through Jackson   county without money, and if I did it,   I must do it on my own faith. I felt   strenuous to keep the commandments,   so I started without money. I called   upon Elder Harry Brown, and asked  him to accompany me; he consented,   and Bishop Partridge appointed him   to go with me.      Jan. 13, 1835—I received an honor-  able discharge from Lyman Wight,  certifying that I had faithfully per-  formed my duties in Zion's Camp.      I took my valise in hand, weighing  15 lbs., mostly Books of Mormon, and   started in company with Elder Harry  Brown, crossed the river into Jackson   county, and felt thankful. We bowed  our knees, and prayed that God might   protect us from the mob while going   through the country, and that his   judgments might rest upon the wicked  who had shed the blood of the Saints  in that land, that the land might be   cleansed from sin. I had a petition   to the Governor of Missouri, for re-  dress of wrongs perpetrated upon us   in Jackson county, for the purpose of   obtaining signatures. We bent our   way south, through Jackson county,   without any molestation; yet, in one  instance, we were preserved from a   mob of about sixty, assembled at a   grog-shop which we had to pass.      (To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 184.)      HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      June [January] 18—We called at the Har-  mony mission, and had an interview   with the President, a Presbyterian  minister. Although it was near sun-  down, he would neither give us any-  thing to eat, nor lodge us, because we   were "Mormons." It was fifteen  miles to the nearest house, which was   Jerrew's Indian trading house. We   asked the minister to direct us there.  He gave us directions, but the Spirit   said to me he was deceiving us. I   asked him three times, and he declared   he was telling us the truth. We   followed his directions, and we came  to the Osage river swamp, where we   were lost in the darkness of the night.   We followed the river, but as it is   very crooked, we made but little pro-  gress. After travelling through mud   and water for one hour, we concluded  to go out on the open prairie, and lie   down in the grass until morning; but   when we got out into the prairie, we  heard the Osage Indians' drum and  shout at the trading house, as they     
 were having a pow-wow. As we ap-  proached, we were met by a dozen   large savage looking dogs; they smelt  us in a friendly manner, but did not   attempt to bite nor bark. We ar-  rived about midnight, covered with   mud, hungry and weary, and were  kindly received and entertained for   the remainder of the night by Mr.   Jerrew, who had an Osage squaw for   a wife; she prepared us a good supper,  but marvelled that we did not drink   coffee. She proffered us their best  bed, which was highly ornamented,   but we declined her kind offer, as we  were wet and muddy. She made us a  good bed of mackinaw blankets, before  a large fire, and we slept comfortably.   May the Lord reward both Mr. Jerrew   and wife, and the Presbyterian mini-  ster, according their deserts.      To be continued.)     
 (Continued from page 200.)      HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      June [January] 19—Mr. Jerrew gave us a   good breakfast, put us across the Osage   river in a canoe, and we started upon   our long day's walk, it being sixty   miles to the nearest house. We had  not anything with us to eat. Most of   our travels through the day was  through prairie; before dark we en-  tered timbered land; as we approached   the timber, a large black bear met us;   we had no weapons. When the bear got  within about six rods of us, he rose upon  his hind feet, and examined us a short   time, and went off. We were soon  enveloped in such thick darkness, that   it was with great difficulty we could   keep the road, and surrounded by a  large drove of wolves, which kept up   a continual howling, and would fre-  quently rush to within a few feet of us.   We travelled about two hours in this   situation, feeling that we were in   danger, and concluded to stop and   build a fire, and wait till morning.  Accordingly, we built a large fire,  which drove the wolves off; and as   we were about to lie down, we heard  a dog bark, and a bell. We felt   assured we were near a house; both   of us took a brand of fire, and on going   about one quarter of a mile, we came   to a log hut, which was occupied by   Mr. Williams, who had been in Jack-  son county during the mobbing of the     
 Saints, and had lately moved here,   depending upon his gun mostly for   his living. It was sixty miles to a  house on the north, and twelve miles  on the south. He and his family were   living in a small old log hut, about   twelve feet square, and one bed in the  room, upon which lay his wife, several  children and three young dogs. He   lay stretched out upon the bare floor,   with his feet to a small fire. There   was no door to the house, but a rag-  ged quilt hung up in the door way; it   was past eleven o'clock at night. I   turned away the quilt, looked into the  house, and spoke three times; no one  stirred, not even a dog. I walked in,   and laid my hands upon the man's   shoulder, and spoke to him. The mo-  ment he felt the weight of my hand,   he leaped to his feet, and commenced   running around the room, leaping as   high as he could each jump. I told   him not to be frightened, as we were   travellers and friends, and did not  wish to hurt him, but wished to stop   with him over night. When he came   to his senses, he gave us permission to   stop with him till morning, if we   would take the bare floor, as he did.   We asked for something to eat, as we   had walked sixty miles without a  morsel of food. He replied, he had   nothing for us, and assured us he had   to kill game for his breakfast in the  morning. He informed us that the  reason of his fright, was in conse-  quence of his having shot a large pan-  ther, a few nights previous, standing  in his door, and he thought his mate   had lit upon him. We lay down upon   the floor, and we were glad of this  place, as it soon began to rain, and   rained through the night.      In the morning we arose, and went   on in the rain twelve miles, to a Mr.   Conner's, who was also in the Jackson  county mob. He gave us breakfast,   but damned us while we were eating,   because we were "Mormons." When  we had finished a hearty breakfast,  we thanked him very politely, and  went on our way, leaving him swear-  ing. We felt thankful for breakfast,   for we had walked seventy-two miles   without eating food. We taught from   house to house as we journeyed.      Jan. 24—I preached at Mr. Nathan  Tanner's, in Green county, Missouri,   the first time we had found a congre-  gation we could preach to in safety,  and the first time that I had ever   attempted to preach as a missionary.   I had great liberty, and was followed  by Elder Brown. During our preach-  ing, there was a snow storm.      We arrived at Petty John Creek, in   Arkansas, where Mr. Alexander Ake-  man resided, with a large family of   sons and one daughter, settled around   him. Mr. Akeman, and a part of the   family, were members of the Church  in Jackson county; his wife died  strong in the faith in Missouri. His  whole family were mobbed, and some  of his sons were whipped severely;  but he could not stand the persecution   and the loss of his property. He  moved to Arkansas, to get rid of   "Mormonism," had apostatized, and   was bitter against the Work. When  we called upon him, he opposed us   strongly—spoke against the leaders of   the Church and the Book of Mormon.   He had one son who received us, and   had a little faith. I dreamed the   night before, that we were required to  walk in a straight, narrow path; and   while following the path, it led to the  door of a house, which was placed in  a high wall that we could not get  around. As I opened the door to go   through, I saw the room was filled   with large serpents. I entered, and   they all coiled up to jump at me; as   they made a spring to bite me, they  all fell dead at my feet, turned black,   swelled up, burst open, took fire, and   were consumed before my eyes.      We met with much opposition from   Mr. Akeman, and many in the neigh-  borhood. Elder Brown wished to   leave the place immediately. I told   him I should stay, and see my dream  fulfilled. We staid in the neighbor-  hood twenty-five days, during which  time the Lord brought judgment upon  those who threatened to mob and kill   us; many of them died suddenly, and  I was warned three times by the Lord,   to go to Mr. Akeman, and bear testi-  mony unto him of the truth of "Mor-  monism," and the wickedness of his   course in opposing it; and the last   time I called upon him, he was filled   with wrath against me, and when I   left his house, he followed me in a  rage, apparently with some evil intent.     
 When I had got a few rods from his   door, he was nearly treading on my  heels, and fell dead at my feet, as  though he had been struck with light-  ning; he swelled, and immediately   turned black. This created a great  wailing and mourning among his   family. Brother Brown and myself   assisted in laying him out and burying  him. He died Feb. 14, 1835.      This singular dispensation of Provi-  dence brought solemnity upon the   people, and they began to reflect and   wished to hear preaching. We held  several meetings and preached, and  baptized Mr. Hubbel and his wife,   who had opened their doors and given   us a home; and just as we had got   the people prepared to receive the  Gospel and anxious to learn, and plead-  ing with us to stay and preach, bro-  Brown resolved that he would con-  tinue his journey south. I was fully   satisfied that should we stop, we   would built up a Church, and was  convinced it was our duty to stop;   but brother Brown held the office of  an Elder, and I submitted.      Brother Brown did not baptize ano-  ther person on the mission.      (To be continued.)     
 (Continued from page 217.)      HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      March 2—We cut down a large   cotton-wood tree, and in two days  dug out a canoe four feet wide and   twelve long, put on a pair of oars,   and then rowed down the Arkansas  river, 125 miles, to Little Rock, beg-  ging our food by the way, a meal at a  time, as we had opportunity. After     
 visiting Little Rock, we travelled down   the river ten miles, and tied up our   canoe on the east bank, and stopped  with Mr. Jones. I preached next day   at his house. On the 16th we left our   canoe with Mr. Jones, and walked   back up the river ten miles, opposite  Little Rock, and took the old military  road, and started to wade the Missis-  sippi swamp, which was mostly cov-  ered with water from Little Rock,   Arkansas, to Memphis, Tennessee, a   distance of about 175 miles. We  waded through mud and water knee   deep, day after day, and in some in-  stances forty miles per day, before we   could get a stopping place.      On the 24th, while in the swamps,   I had an attack of the rheumatism, and   could not travel fast. My companion,  brother Brown, had got in a hurry,   and wished to return to his family in   Kirtland; and as I could not travel as   fast as he wished, we parted. He   left me sitting on a log in the mud  and water; I was lame and unable to   walk, without food, and twelve miles   from the nearest house on the road.   He went out of sight in great haste.  I then knelt down in the water, and  prayed to the Lord to heal me. The   Spirit of the Lord rested upon me,   and I was healed; the pain left me;   I arose and went my way. Whenever  I met with one or more families, I  preached and bore testimony to them.      I crossed the Mississippi river in the   evening of the 27th of March, and   stayed at a public house kept by Mr.  Josiah Jackson. I was suspected of  being an impostor. Mr. Jackson   believed I was one of Murril's clan,   who were then murdering and steal-  ing negroes; and to test me, he   gathered together a large house full   of the most wicked and corrupt peo-  ple in the city, and set me to preach-  ing, to see whether I could preach or   not.      I do not think that Mr. Jackson, or   the same company of men and women,   will ever meet together again for the   same purpose, for they would not like   again to have their sins and abomina-  tions revealed to each other as point-  edly as I told them that night, through   the inspiration of the Holy Ghost;  they were glad to get rid of me upon  almost any terms.      I travelled from Memphis to Middle   Tennessee.      April 4—I met with Elder Warren   Parrish, in Benton county. He and   David W. Patten had labored together   through the winter in Tennessee, and   baptized twenty persons. Elder Pat-  ten had returned to Kirtland. I   joined Elder Parrish, and we labored   together over three months, travelling  and preaching daily; baptizing such  as would receive our testimony; ex-  tending our labors in Tennessee and   Kentucky.      June 23—We received a letter from   Oliver Cowdery, requesting Elder  Parrish to come to Kirtland, and for  me to remain and take charge of the  southern churches, and the Lord would   bless me in so doing.      June 28—Warren Parrish ordained   me an Elder. We baptized some forty   persons while laboring together.      July 23—Elder Parrish left. I   travelled alone through the year, and  extended my labors both in Kentucky   and Tennessee. I baptized forty-three  persons during this season, thirty-one  after brother Parrish left.      Nov. 15—While travelling in the  night, with brother Benjamin L. Clapp   and others, a tremendous storm of   wind and rain overtook us. We came   to a creek which had swollen to such   an extent by the rain, that we could   not cross without swimming our   horses; several of the company were   females. We undertook to head the   stream, to ford it; but in the attempt,  in the midst of the darkness and the  raging of the wind and rain, we were  lost in the thick woods, amidst the  rain, wind, creeks and fallen tree-  tops. We crossed streams nearly  twenty times. I was reminded of  Paul's perils by water; but the Lord  was merciful unto us in the midst of  our troubles, for while we were grop-  ing in the dark, running the risk of   killing both ourselves and animals,   by riding off precipitous bluffs, a   bright light suddenly shone round   about us, and revealed our perilous   situation, as we were upon the edge of   a deep gulf. The light continued with  us until we found a house, and learned   the right road; then the light dis-  appeared, and we were enabled to  reach the house of brother Henry     
 Thomas, at nine o'clock, all safe, hav-  ing rode twenty miles, five hours in   the storm, and we felt to thank the  Lord for our preservation.      During the winter and spring, I   continued to labor mostly alone,   through Kentucky and Tennessee,   opening new places, preaching daily,   baptizing, confirming, and organizing   new Branches.      Feb. 26, 1836—At a Conference   held at Brother B. L. Clapp's, in  Callaway county, Kentucky, I or-  dained A. O. Smoot and Benjamin   Boydston, Elders, and B. L. Clapp   and Daniel Thomas, Priests.      Brothers Smoot and Clapp both  entered into the labors of the ministry.   Elder Smoot frequently accompanied  me on my mission. Elder D. W.   Patten returned to Tennessee in   April, and joined us in our labors,   accompanied by his wife. It was a  happy meeting. He related to me  the blessings he had received in Kirt-  land during the endowments. We   travelled and labored together; perse-  cution raged against us. Elder Pat-  ten bore a strong and forcible testi-  mony of the Work of God; and when   we were opposed by mobs, he would   rebuke them in great plainness; we   were threatened, but not injured. The  sick were healed under our admini-  strations.      May 27—Elder Warren Parrish   arrived from Kirtland. We held a   Conference on the 28th, at brother  Seth Utley's. Seven Branches were   represented, containing 116 members.   Abel Wilson and Jesse Turpin were   ordained Priests, and Albert Petty a   Teacher.      —31—I was ordained by David   W. Patten, a member of the Second   Quorum of Seventies.      We labored over a circuit of several  hundred miles. Brother Smoot la-  bored with us, and brother Clapp  frequently. We travelled two by two,   and all met together to hold Confe-  rences.      (To be continued.)     
 (Continued from page 232.)      HISTORY   OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      June 19—A States warrant was   issued against D. W. Patten, Warren  Parrish and Wilford Woodruff, sworn   out by Matthew Williams, a Metho-  dist priest, and served by the sheriff,   Robert C. Petty. Elders Patten and   Parrish were taken by an armed mob   of about fifty, under pretence of law,  led by the sheriff, a colonel, first and   second major, with other officers, and   a Methodist priest with a gun upon his   shoulder. I was in another county,   and therefore not taken. We were  accused of prophesying falsely, by   saying that four persons who were   baptized should receive the Holy  Ghost in twenty-four hours, and that   Christ should come the second time  before this generation passed away.   The whole concern was a mob mock   trial, contrary to law, justice, judg-  ment or truth.      On the 29th, I went to a Baptist  meeting-house, on Thompson's creek,   to preach; the house was crowded.   As I rose to speak, a Baptist priest,   Mr. Browning, arrived at the door on   horseback, and stepped in greatly   agitated, and told the deacon to forbid   my preaching in the house, at the  same time commenced a tirade of   abuse against the "Mormons," telling  several lies, which I corrected before  the people, which increased his rage.  As I was forbidden to preach in the   house, and had been invited, and tra-  velled many miles to fulfil my ap-  pointment, I told the people I would  like to preach, and was willing to   stand on a wood pile, a fence, a cart,   or any place they would appoint. A   man rose and said he owned the land   in front of the meeting-house, and I   might stand and preach on that, and  welcome. All the congregation, with  the exception of the minister and one  deacon, arose and left the house,   walked across the street, and formed   seats of a worm fence, and gave good  attention while I preached for an hour   and-a-half, on the principles of the  Gospel.      When I closed, Mr. Randolph Alex-  ander, who had never heard a "Mor-  mon" Elder speak before, said, the   people of the present day made him  think of a pen of hogs; the keeper  would make a trough, and pour into  it hot or cold water, dish water, or   anything else, and they would drink   it; but let a stranger come along, and   pour over a basket of corn on the back   side of the pen, and the hogs would   be frightened, and run and snort all   over the pen. He said it was so with   the people; the priests would feed  them with any kind of doctrine, no   matter how false, the people will   swallow it down; but let a stranger  come and preach the Gospel of Jesus  Christ, which will save the people, as   Mr. Woodruff has done, and the peo-  ple are afraid of him.      Mr. Alexander invited me home,  bought a Book of Mormon, and was  soon baptized, and several others  followed his example.      July 14—I wrote a letter to Oliver   Cowdery, and sent him a list of sub-  scribers for the Messenger and Advocate,   and a detail of my mission in the south.      —18—I rode in company with A.   O. Smoot to a ferry on the Tennessee   river. The ferryman was absent.   We were offered the use of the boat,   and ferried ourselves; but not being  much used to the business, and losing  one oar in the river, and having to  row with a broken oar, we landed a   great distance below the usual place,     
 with a high circulation of blood and  blistered hands; but our horses leapt  the bank, and we went on our way to  the Sandy, which we swam, and spent   the night at Thomas Frazer's.      —30—We preached at Mr. David   Crider's, also on Sunday the 31st,   where we were threatened by a mob.  I baptized Mr. Crider amid the scoffs   of the rabble, who went in the night   and poisoned both of our horses; the   one which I rode, belonging to brother  Samuel West, died in two days after-  wards; brother Smoot's recovered;   the swine that eat of the horse flesh   also died.      Aug. 11—I met with D. W. Patten   and wife; he and brother Parrish had   been driven out of Benton into Henry  county, and Elder Parrish had left for  Kirtland.      —29—We were visited by Elders   T. B. Marsh and E. H. Groves, from   Caldwell county, Mo.      Sept. 2—We held a Conference at   Damon's Creek, Callaway county,   Kentucky; several Branches were re-  presented, containing 119 members.   Johnson F. Lane, Benjamin L. Clapp,   and Randolph Alexander, were or-  dained Elders, and Lindsey Bradey a   priest, by D. W. Patten, who baptized   five at the close of the Conference.      I was released from my labors in   the south, and counselled to go to   Kirtland and receive my endowments,  as was also A. O. Smoot.      Sept. 19—Elders Marsh and D. W.   Patten and wife, and E. H. Groves,  started for Far West. I organized   the first company of Saints who emi-  grated from the Southern States, which   numbered twenty-two souls. I ap-  pointed Elder Boydston President of   the company, and counselled them to   be united, and to remember their   prayers night and day before the   Lord.      —20—The camp started. I spent   a few days visiting the Branches; bap-  tized and confirmed eight, and ob-  tained thirty subscribers for the  Messenger and Advocate.      (To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 248.)      HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      Oct. 20—In company with A. O.   Smoot and Jesse Turpin, I started for   Kirtland; this was the first time I   had ever travelled on a steamboat.   We left the steamer at Louisville, on  the 28th, and spent nineteen days  visiting Elder Smoot's relations, and   preaching among the people; we visi-  ted the Big Bone Lick. We arrived   in Cincinnatti, Nov. 17th, where we  saw thirteen persons dead and   wounded, taken from the steamer   Flora, which had burst her pipes  while running a race; arrived in Kirt-  land on the 25th, and had the happy   privilege of meeting the Prophet   Joseph, and many Elders with whom   I was acquainted in the Camp of Zion.      —29—I heard Joseph preach in the  Temple. In the afternoon I was   called to speak, and read the ##Isaiah 56|56th   chap##. of Isaiah, and made some re-  marks, and gave an account of my   mission in the south; Elder Smoot   also addressed the Saints.      I was counselled by the Presidency  to attend the school in the Temple,   taught by Professor Haws. I studied   the Latin language and English gram-  mar, and boarded with brother Ira   Bond.      I attended meetings with the Seven-  ties and other Quorums, during the   winter of 1836-7, and received much   valuable instruction.      Dec. 20, 1836—I was present at the  organization of the Third Quorum of   the Seventies; there were twenty-  seven ordained.      Jan. 3, 1837—I was set apart to   be a member of the First Quorum of  Seventies.      —25—At early candle light, a cloud  began to arise in the north-east, and   reached to the north-west, having the  appearance of fire, and it soon spread  over the whole horizon. The reflec-  tion of the clouds upon the earth,   which was covered with snow, had   a blood-red appearance. It com-  menced at about 6 o'clock, and lasted  till past 10 p.m.     
 —29—Presidents Joseph Smith and   O. Cowdery addressed the Saints in  the Temple. Joseph blessed the peo-  ple in the name of the Lord, and said,  if we would be faithful, we should  arise above our embarrassments, and   be delivered from the hands of our   enemies.      —30—I wrote an article on faith,  which was published in the Messenger  and Advocate.      Feb. 19—I attended meeting at the  Temple. President Joseph Smith had  been absent on business for the Church,  but not half as long as Moses was in   the mount away from Israel; yet  many of the people in Kirtland, if   they did not make a calf to worship,  as did the Israelites, turned their   hearts away from the Lord, and from   his servant Joseph, and had engaged   in speculation, and given way to   false spirits, until they were darkened   in their minds; and many were op-  posed to Joseph Smith, and some   wished to appoint David Whitmer to  lead the Church in his stead. [##Exodus 32:1-8##] In the  midst of this cloud of dark spirits,  Joseph returned to Kirtland, and this   morning arose in the stand. He ap-  peared much depressed; but soon the   Spirit of God rested upon him, and he   addressed the assembly in great plain-  ness for about three hours, and put  his enemies to silence. When he arose  he said, "I am still the President,   Prophet, Seer, Revelator and Leader  of the Church of Jesus Christ. God,   and not man, has appointed and   placed me in this position, and no man  or set of men have power to remove   me, or appoint another in my stead;  and those who undertake this, if they  do not speedily repent, will burn their   fingers and go to hell." He reproved  the people sharply for their sins, dark-  ness and unbelief. The power of God  rested upon him, and bore testimony   that his sayings were true.      March 23rd was spent in the Temple  by the Saints in Kirtland, in fasting  and prayer. Patriarch Joseph Smith,   sen., presided. The Spirit of the   Lord was poured out upon the people.  A contribution was taken up for the  poor.      April 4—I received my washings   and anointings in the house of the  Lord. I spent the whole night in the  Temple, with others of the Seventies,   in prayer and fasting; the Spirit of   the Lord rested upon us. After  twenty-four hours I partook of food.      —6—The Presidency of the Church,   the Twelve Apostles, and other Quo-  rums, met in solemn assembly, and   sealed upon our heads our washings,  anointings and blessings, with a loud   shout of hosannah to God and the   Lamb; the Spirit of the Lord rested  upon us. After spending three hours  in the upper room, the Quorums re-  paired to the lower court; the vails   were lowered, and the ordinance of  washing of feet was administered.  Elder H. C. Kimball washed my feet,   and pronounced blessings upon me.  After this ordinance, the vails of the  Temple were rolled up, and President   Joseph Smith addressed the Elders for   three hours, clothed with the Spirit  and power of God. He unbosomed   his feelings in the house of his friends,  and gave much instruction. He urged  upon us the absolute necessity of   giving strict heed to his teachings and   counsel, and the revelations of the   Lord to the Church, and be wise in   all things, that Zion and her stakes  may be redeemed and established, no  more to be thrown down. He said,  that the kings of the earth would yet   come to behold the glory of Zion, and  that great and glorious blessings would  be bestowed upon the Saints in the   last days. Hyrum Smith bore testi-  mony, and was followed by Oliver   Cowdery, who exhorted the Elders to  keep within the bounds of their know-  ledge, and let the mysteries of the   kingdom alone, for the Gentiles had  not a knowledge even of the first   principles of the Gospel. He said, it  is far better to preach what the people   would call the small things of the  kingdom, than to enter into the visions   of Isaiah, Ezekiel and John. The   Twelve broke bread, which was distri-  buted to the multitude, who eat and   were filled; thanks were returned,   and the meeting closed at the setting   of the sun.      The house was again filled at candle   light. President Smith requested the   Elders to speak their feelings freely,   and sing, exhort and pray, as the Spi-  rit should give utterance. The meet-  ing continued during the whole night;     
 many of the gifts were poured out  upon the people; at break of day we  were dismissed.      I also spent the night of the 7th in  the Temple, with several of the Elders,   in prayer and praise before the Lord;   the Holy Ghost rested upon us, and   the spirit of prophecy was given, and  many things were shown by the holy   Spirit.      April 9—President Smith spoke in  the afternoon, and said in the name   of the Lord, that the judgments of  God would rest upon those men who   had professed to be his friends, and  friends of humanity, and in building   up Kirtland, a stake of Zion, but had   turned traitors to him, and the inter-  ests of the kingdom of God, and had   given power into the hands of our   enemies against us; they had oppressed  the poor Saints, and had brought dis-  tress upon them, and had become   covenant-breakers, for which they will   feel the wrath of God.      April 13, 1837—I married Phebe   W. Carter, daughter of Ezra and   Sarah Carter, of Scarborough, Maine.   The ceremony was performed at the  house of President Joseph Smith, by  Fred. G. Williams, Esq. The Pro-  phet Joseph appointed to marry us,  but his life was sought by a mob, and  he had to flee.      —15—I received my patriarchal bles-  sing under the hands of the Patriarch,   Joseph Smith, sen.; my wife having  received her patriarchal blessing pre-  viously.       (To be continued.)     
 (Continued from page 265.)      HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      May 5—While laboring for Joseph   Young, Kirtland was visited with a   sudden storm of wind and rain, a cur-  rent passed south of the Temple in the   form of a whirlwind or tornado, which  destroyed and injured several build-  ings, it crushed one of Joseph Young's   buildings, and removed the one we   were in some 10 feet, but no person   was injured.      I felt impressed to go out upon a  mission; the Spirit was upon me, and   led me to go to Fox Islands; it was a  country I had never visited. I named  my feelings upon the subject to Elders  Kimball, Rigdon and others; they   encouraged me to go. Elder Kimball   blessed me, and said in the name of   the Lord, I should be blessed and   prospered on my mission, and do a   good work. I proposed to Jonathan   H. Hale to accompany me, which he   did.      May 31—I left my wife and friends   in Kirtland, and walked to Fairport   with brother Hale; we were joined by  Milton Holmes, and took the steamer   Sandusky and arrived in Buffalo, June   1st, and Syracuse on the 4th; walked  36 miles to Richmond [Richland], Oswego county,   New York, and called upon my two   brothers, Azmon and Thomson, whom   I had not seen for several years. We   visited the churches as far as Sackett's   Harbor, called upon Archibald  Patten, and delivered to him some   letters from Warren Parish, in which   were enclosed many one hundred  dollar bills, which he had taken from  the Kirtland Bank.      We crossed Lake Ontario, visited  Upper Canada, and attended a confe-  rence, May 10th, with Elders John E.   Page and James Blakesly, in the   township of Bastard, Leeds County.   There were eight branches represented,   containing 300 members. 13 Elders,   5 Priests, 8 Teachers and 6 Deacons.   Elder William Draper and myself   ordained 7 Elders, 9 Priests, 11 Teach-  ers, and 5 Deacons: five were baptized  by Elder Page at the close of the Con-  ference.      A woman was possessed of the devil   and greatly afflicted, much of the time   was dumb; four of us laid hands upon  her, and cast the devil out in the   name of Jesus Christ, and she was   made whole, and gave thanks unto  God, and went on her way rejoic-  ing.      We visited several other Branches   and preached the word of God, and  several of the sick were healed.      We returned to Kingston, took   steamer for Oswego, and canal for  Albany; Brothers John Goodson,   Isaac Russel and John Snider accom-  panied us from Canada, and left us at   Schenectady, to join Elders Kimball,  Hyde and Richards at New York, to  go to England.      We walked from Albany to Farm-  ington, Conn.; attended a conference   of the Saints in Canaan; arrived at  my father's house July 6th. This was   the first time I had seen my father or   relatives in Conn., since I joined the   Church; they received me kindly.  On the 10th, I preached in the City  Hall in Colinsville, and a mob gather-  ed and attempted to break up the  meeting, with fife and drum, holloa-  ing and yelling; they were urged on  by a Presbyterian priest. At the close   of the meeting the priest came to me     
 with his rabble, and asked many ques-  tions; he said I had no right to my   opinion, and no man had a right to  preach the gospel unless he had a   collegiate education. I told him I  would admit that point, when he would  tell me at what college Jesus Christ  and his Apostles obtained their educa-  tion: the priest and rabble then   left.      —12—I preached in a school house   in West Avon to an attentive congre-  gation; after meeting I baptized my  uncle, Ozem Woodruff, his wife and   son, John, in fulfilment of a dream   which I had at ten years of age.      I visited most of my relatives in   Conn., and preached the Gospel to   them.      —16—I preached at Adna Hart's  in Avon, where I was met by my step-  mother and sister, also by my wife,   who had travelled alone from Kirtland,   and was on her way to visit her father  in Maine.      —19—Elder Hale went to New  Rowley, Mass., to visit his friends.   I had been solicited to preach to the  citizens of Farmington by many promi-  nent men, but every room which was   offered me, including the town hall,   was closed against me by the Rev.  Noah Porter, pastor of the Presby-  terian church, until the Methodist  church was offered me, which he had  not influence to close. Two hours   after I gave out the appointment, the   house was filled, and I preached to a  very attentive congregation, including   my father and his household, for an   hour and a half, upon the first princi-  ples of the Gospel; I gave liberty to  the assembly to ask any questions, or  find any fault with what I had said,   but I met with no opposition.      —20—I left my father's house, and,   with my wife, rode by stage to Hart-  ford.      —21—Not having money to pay  the fare for us both, I paid her fare in  the stage to New Rowley, Mass., and  I walked through a hot sultry day  fifteen hours, averaging three and a  half miles per hour, making 52  miles.      —22—I walked 48 miles.      —23—I walked 36 miles, and ar-  rived at Elder Nathaniel Holme's, in   New Rowley, at two o'clock, p.m.,   making 136 miles in a little over two   days and a half. I met with my wife  and Elder Milton Holmes, at his   father's house: I spent several days   in preaching to the Saints in that   region.      Aug. 1—We left New Rowley, and   was joined by Elder Hale, who accom-  panied us to Saco, Maine.      —7—I accompanied my wife to her  father's in Scarborough, Maine. We   were kindly received: it was the first   time I had seen any of her relations.   We found mother Carter very sick.   I spent several days visiting the Saints  in that region.      —10—I accompanied Ezra and   Fabien Carter, my brothers-in-law,   on a fishing excursion; we caught  with hooks 250 codfish, haddock, and   hake, and saw four whales; it being  the first time I had ever seen that   class of fish that swallowed Jonah.      —18—With Elder Hale, I started  to fill my mission on Fox Islands; we   walked to Portland, and spent the   night at Mr. Samuel Hale's.      —19—We took the steamer Bangor   85 miles to Owl's Head, where we   arrived at sunset, without means to  prosecute our journey further. We   retired to a high hill, and bowed   before the Lord, and prayed that he  would open our way; the spirit of the  Lord rested upon us, and testified   unto us that our prayers would be   answered. As we arose from our  knees, a sloop came into the harbor;   we went to the captain, and enquired   where he was going; he replied,   through the channel of Vinal Haven;   he took us on board and landed us on  North Fox Islands, at 2 a.m. on the  20th. We wandered in the dark about  an hour, rambling over rocks and   bushes, found the house of Mr. Natha-  niel Dyer, and were entertained. It  being Sunday morning, Mr. Benjamin   Kent piloted us to the Baptist meet-  ing-house, occupied by Elder Gideon  J. Newton, pastor of the only religious   denomination upon the Island. At   the door, I sent for the deacon, and  told him I wished him to inform the  minister that we were servants of God,  and wished to deliver a message to  that people. The minister sent word   for us to come into the pulpit; accord-  ingly, with valise in hand, we walked     
 up into the pulpit, and took a seat o n   each side of him. When he closed his  discourse, he asked me what hour we   would like to speak; I told him at  five; he gave out our appointment,   and invited us to his house. I asked   him how many school houses were on   the Island; he said four, and gave me   their names. I asked him if they   were free for any one to preach in; he  answered in the affirmative. I took  out my Bible, Book of Mormon, and   Doctrine and covenants, and laid them   all upon his stand; he promised to  read them. The hour of meeting arri-  ved, and I preached to a full house   upon the first principles of the Gospel,   and bore testimony that the Lord had  raised up a prophet, and had com-  menced to establish his church and   Kingdom again upon the earth, in  fulfilment of his word, as spoken   through the ancient Prophets and   Apostles. This was the first discourse  ever delivered by any Latter-day   Saint upon this chain of islands;  Elder Hale bore testimony. I gave  out appointments for preaching in  the four school houses. The people   came out in masses to investigate the   principles which we taught. In four-  teen days we preached nineteen dis-  courses. Capt. Justice Ames and   wife were baptized by Elder Hale.  Elder Newton, the Baptist minister,   with his family attended twelve of our   meetings, read the books, and was   convinced by the spirit of the Lord   that our doctrine was true, and he  had a hard struggle in his mind to   know which to do, receive or reject it;   he finally resolved to reject it, and   commenced preaching against us. He  sent for Mr. Douglass, Methodist  minister, on the South Island, to come   and help him; he had been long at   variance with Mr. Douglass, but they   became very friendly and united in a  war against us. We continued preach-  ing daily, until we baptized most of   the members of Mr. Newton's church,  and those who owned the meeting   house.      (To be continued.)     
 (Continued from page 281.)      HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      I followed Mr. Douglas to his own  island, and commenced preaching to  his church, and baptized a good share   of his members, among whom were  several sea captains. Ministers from   the main land were sent for, who  came over and tried to put a stop to  the work, by preaching and lying  about us; but the work continued to   roll on. They wished me to work a  miracle to convince them that my doc-  trine was true. I told them they had   rejected the truth, and they would   see signs, but not unto salvation.      Vinal Haven, which includes both   north and south Fox Island, is in lat.  44°, long. 69°10'. The inhabitants   are generally healthy and industrious,   and hospitable to strangers, the people   obtain most of their wealth by fishing,   and fit out annually over one hundred   licensed vessels, beside many smaller   crafts. The north island is nine miles  long and two wide; population 800,   and contains a post office, a store,   a grist mill, four school houses, and a   Baptist church. The land is rocky   and rough, yet there are farms which   produce good wheat, barley, oats,   potatoes and grass; the principal  timber is fir, spruce, hemlock and   birch. The rasp and gooseberry grow  in great abundance. Sheep are the  principal stock.      South Fox island is about ten miles  long and five wide, and is a mass of  rocks, principally granite, formed into   shelves, hills, hollows, and cut up into   nooks, points and ravines by coves  and harbors; population 1000. There  are some small patches under cultiva-  tion, at the expense of great labor and   toil. Many resident fishermen fish at   Newfoundland, and bring them home,   and dry them upon flakes; they annu-  ally supply the market with a great  amount of codfish, mackerel and   boxed herring. The latter island   contains two stores, three tide saw   mills, six school houses, a small branch
