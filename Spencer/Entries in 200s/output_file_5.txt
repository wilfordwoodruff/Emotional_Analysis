ENDENTRY  A. E. Hinckley. Hackberry  end of sideways text           to drop you a few lines. You will excuse the bad gram- mar, spelling, without any punctuation, passing over all, until we come to this place. On the 26th of Dec. last we arrived at this place, and found a portion of the  Wallapais tribe of Indians here, and added to their low and filthy condition, the corruption and diseases of civ- ilization and, in looking forward to the time when the Lord would fulfil his promises upon them, I realized that it was the Lord's work, and that He would have to work by his power, manifest in their midst, to bring it about. I learned that this nation had no place to gather to, to farm and till the earth. The whites have taken up the watering places, and the Indians, in many places where they used to be the lords of the soil, have to pay to water their horses now. The government has stopped giving them rations and they are in a bad condition. Still, the chief refuses to accept of our going to any place with them, to learn them to farm, or school their children. He says that they were on the reservation a few years, their children to school, many of them died, and he would rather they would live, hunt rabbits, work for the Americans, cut wood, wash dishes, and so forth, than gather together, be sick and die,  and he does not want us to come there with anything of the   promise. Our promise is to write to the Mormon Chief,  and he will do as he thinks best, and Brother Harris is to meet them and report to them whether there is any one comes or not, and, if not, to tell them the reason why. There is large tracts of good land on the Colorado River, above and below Fort Mojave. The Shemojaves are situated in their valley about 60 miles below the Fort. There is some good land in their valley, but most of the tribe is below there, on the reservation on the California side, 50 miles below their valley, and a portion of the Mojave tribe is on this side the river, oppo- site them, on their reservation. The location is good to reach them and the Wallapais in the Mojave Valley, and this Chief that can read and write we think will be of great benefit to the cause, if he obeys the Gospel. The promises made to them, the Mojaves, was 20 years ago, or more, yet they told us of it. This shows that they never forget, so that we made ours con- ditional, as I said. Told them that the Lord had told our Chief to send us out to tell them to be at peace with all, to become one with us, to learn to do good, be brothers together. I guess that I have written enough in my wandering way this time. Hope that I shall be able to say more in less words in the future.   We remain, your brothers in the Gospel, A. E. Hinckley. ENDENTRY  in different parts of America &amp; Europe, has been crowned with success, yet should I  believe that I could be of any avail to your sacred cause, I would not hesitate to leave the Catholic laurels to others &amp; to go under your guidance fight the good fight for your divine Faith, because I  But, owing, I presume, to my feeling my  worthyness, I do but present you &amp; your dear family &amp; your people with my greatest Sympathy and ENDENTRY  a while, but until then this is his decision positive now. The tribe is fast wasting away with venereal diseases. There appears to be no place to commence with them, but to work with their neighbors. We have been to the Mojave tribe. They wish you to send some families to come and  work with them, teach them better how to farm and school their children. They make two propositions—one, to go with some of them and clear some land, 20 miles below St. Mojave;  another, on a piece of land above the fort, about four miles, which is cleared, which the River overflows, and is sure of making a crop. The land below is not safe or sure without digging wells and putting up windmills. The land in both places is very rich. The land below belongs to government and the Railroad. That above is at present occupied by the head Chief. The chiefs are very anxious, and also the people, to  have some of our people to come, and we think that it is one of the best chances of bringing about the work with them. Brother Harris has promised to be back there in four months. He expresses himself that he would like to go and settle there, as he says that they are the finest tribe in this Territory. They are a very industrious people, but they have become very much diseased and are somewhat under the control of the whites, but there is no denomination or sect among them. The second chief can read and write. We left with him the Book  of Mormon. His name is Mariman. If you can send   Mojave Indians, Fort Mojave. He is a well disposed man. He says that he wants to do right when he knows what right is. We think that he will be a very useful man in the future. We think that 2 or 3 families at each place could do great good. Brother Harris will be there about the first of May, and if you think that  it is wise to send some Elders to meet him there, either with or without their families, to commence work with them, you will please let us know at Mesa. Direct in care of Pres. A. F. MacDonald. If they come, the most direct road will be by St. George, Pearce's Ferry, from thence to Mineral Park, from there to Fort Mojave. We send this by way of suggestion. Brother Harris will meet them, the Chiefs, whether anyone is sent or not. It will be as you, the Council say, whether he stops with them or not. He has said as much, that he would like to do so, if he could be as useful there as otherwise. He is a very zealous man. As to myself, to be a travelling missionary than to be located in a tribe, and indeed I believe with such a man as Ephraim Hanks, if we were as well united in faith and feelings as we were when we were out to meet the hand-cart company, that we would be will- ing to keep on south among the Lamanites until we come to the end of them, if we could live faithful enough to do so.

It has now over 700 Councils and 35,000 members in the United States and Canada. It is an Order making provisions for paying, in addition to sick and death benefits, one to its aged members, and also providing for a benefit to those who become totally disabled by reason of either disease or accident. It has met with the approval and endorsement of the think- ing public.

I am sorry that the Chuch was in such a lamentable condition of unbelief, at the time you  testify that you and the Twelve got your endowments, keys, blessings, and powers, from Joseph Smith the prophet. If you had been faithful to God as you should have been, instead of receiveing your endowments from man, you could have a greater blessing from God, even  the gifts of the Holy Ghost, as they did on the day of Jerusalem; you could  have the promise of the Savior made good to you, so well as them; See the last chapter of  Mark as follows: "And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they  cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they  drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they  shall recover." xx ##Mark 16:17-18## "And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working  with them, and confirming the word with signs following." See also the teaching of Paul the apostle in first Corinthians and 12th chapter on spiritual Gifts. ##I Corinthians 12## I call your attention to these things because you appear as if you had forgotten  them, in your great zeal to establish an other order of things in the Church. Through  your transgressions you have lost much of the powers of heaven, you have exchanged the blessings of heaven for the things of the earth, instead of being spiritually minded,  you have become carnally minded, and have addopted a law of carnal com- mandments, instead of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. What has become of the spirit- ual Gifts that was given by the God of heaven, with the Everlasting Gospel in the  beginning, when it was restored in its fullness to man on the earth? Did you and the  Twelve Apostles all agree and join together, to stop the Saints that had these gifts to use them? If you did have a voice or vote to that effect, you are under condemnation.

The Saints  had sacrifised all earthly pleasures, leaveing their homes and relations and endureing insults, dishonor, and persecution, for the sake of secureing the favor and gifts of the Eternal  God, according to the promise of His Son, but to their grief and dissappointment when  they arrived among the mountains of Utah, instead of being encouraged in their  spiritual course of righteousness, their attention was called to a law of carnal com- mandments doing away with that which was spiritual, even those things that was their  comfort, and consolation, that enabled them to endure all their aflictions, and tribulations, even the grandest and greatest gifts of God to man, that they relied on in life, or in death, in time, or in eternity, even the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Where was that love and sym- pathy that you should have for your brothers and sisters, when you caused them  to stop useing the gifts of the gospel of Christ? The greatest comfort they had in the  world was taken from them at that time, the Gifts that enabled them to commune with the Great Father and Son, through the Holy Ghost, the saints was hindered  from useing. What right do you suppose you had to change the sacred and eternal  order of the house or Church of God?

Eadwin Woodring.   Louisa Co. Iowa. ENDENTRY      Beloved President   erty I take in thus writing to you, but it ^is^ nothing but the agony I suffer that would induce me to do so. Will be as brief as the circumstances will admit of. I was president of a Ward Primary Association at the time the call was made for means to complete our grand &amp; noble Temple &amp; I found out my nerves were giving out under the strain of that ^&amp;^ with the cares of a large family of small children &amp; unable to afford help. but my desire to keep up until we had given entertainments enough to donate a goodly portion to that cause  prevented me from resigning &amp; the Sisters with whom I was laboring felt like it would be wrong to resign when  ENDENTRY         request, I will endeavor to improve the present opportunity by writing a few lines to you. With a few slight exceptions I have enjoyed good health since leaving the valley. I presume you are aware of our delay at California, which was occasioned by circumstances that we were unable to control, therefore I believe it was all right. I landed at Honolulu the 24 and Johnson, being the last that arrived, of the Breathren that were ^appointed^ to this mission, by the last April conference. I stayed in Honolulu untill after the funeral of the old successor, which took place on the 10 ndid affair and reflected much credit on the Kingdom. As this Island had been designated as my  labor, myself and Bro. Whitney (who was also appointed to this Is Island the morning of the 13 task of learning the native language. Bros. R. A. Allred and Molen are upon this Island. Bro. Molen has been here about three months, he can talk some but has not a sufficient knowledge of the language to preach much yet, but is making rapid progress, the young Breathren generaly   them have commenced preaching. Judging from the length of time that I have been here, Bro. Molen thinks I will get the language pretty quick, but it is tedious for a person that has not been accustomed to confine their mind to any one thing. The Breathren that were here when the last lot came, will all probably leave for home, after our July ENDENTRY  Oct 23     O Hyde &amp; get advice ENDENTRY  of spiritual power from Him who is Almightly, but to our sorrow instead of geting more abundantly of the fruit of righteousness, even that portion we had was made inactive or inoperative through your Order of things. The nurishment that is necessary for a spiritual increase has been stopped, the result is a spiritual weakness causeing  many to be discouraged and fall by the way unheeded and unaided by many that pass by. The young people among us have not been accustomed to see nor feel  the power of God manifested through the Gifts of the Spirit, the most of them depend on  the words of others, instead of getting a Knowledge for themselves from God. Hence the  urgent necessity of granting me and others that desire, the priviledge and right to  preach the fullness of the Gospel, as it was restored in its purity from God, to man in these  last days. I hope that the end of all that is dark corrupt and miserable is at hand, and  that the dawning of a brighter day will soon spread its glory over the world, when  the Gifts of the Holy Ghost which is the power of the Everlasting Gospel, will be  enjoyed by all those that believe in it.  There is thousands of honest people in these  mountains that would be willing and thankful to have the priviledge to live  according to the fullness of the Gospel, and would rejoice and give glory to God in the hightest, if they had the gifts of the Holy Ghost according to the promise of  Jesus Christ. If you deem yourselves unworthy to receive the Gifts of the Holy Ghost,  according to the pattern given in the Holy scriptures, then you should step aside to make room for them that have faith, that God can and will bring about a  restoreation, of all the gifts and powers that has been lost to you by transgression, but  secured to all that have faith in the unchangeable covenant of the Everlasting Gospel.  What do you suppose that furture generations will think of your conduct towards me, in refuseing to give me a hearing, when I testify to you conserning the things that  has been revealed to me? If you do not repent, your condemnation will go forth ENDENTRY      to your request I will give you my op route from Bluffs. the route I would advise—is—that  by Keokuck Iowa from thence to Fort desmoines and from thence to the Bluffs by way of Pisgah or by the new route lately laid out. My reasons—are these   dangerous navigation of the Missouri  river   waggons in Saint Louis—ship them up to  the above places—there fit them up for your journey while at the same time a portion of your company  the Northern part of Illenoise or into Missouri bordering on the  Missippi where oxen and cows are much cheaper than at the Bluffs ENDENTRY    tinued until the following June when the anniversary of Pres't Young's Birth- day was to be celebrated by the children &amp; when those exercises were over, &amp; a short time after another child was born to me I was a complete nervous wreck &amp; am yet; my brain troubling me to such an extent I can scarcely endure the children to speak to me &amp; when they worry me I feel like I would go raving mad. The oldest one is a boy of 12 yrs &amp; I am obliged to remain all day alone with them.  On account of my long seige of help- lessness we are very much reduced in circumstances &amp; for that reason it is very difficult to get help.   ENDENTRY   ENDENTRY  Islands generaly speaking, although the faith of the saints  in some places, they are a weak minded people and unless continualy stired up will become slack and negligent. at one branch where I stayed a couple of weeks, the Presiding Elder and a number of the members threatened to leave the Church in consequence of having to feed us, but there are many good saints here, that are willing to do all they can for the Elders, but after all the Elders have a great many difficulties to encounter as the natives are so poor it is almost impossible to get the means to defray the expences of going to the different Islands, to attend conference &amp;c. But when a servent of God goes out in the world to procl- aim the principles of  eternal life, they naturaly expect to  of fare that they receive at home in the valleys of the mou- ntains, at least I did not, I expected to pass through some pretty tight places, and ^to^ undergo hardships &amp; suffer privations, if I do not have to suffer anything but should receive my pay as I go along of course I should not expect to be rewarded hereafter, my prayer is continualy that the Lord will streangthen me &amp; enable me to be the instrument in his hands of accomplishing some good in this Kingdom. It appears to be a difficult task to better the condition of this people in their present  with the influences that do   rising people could no doubt be made very productive, vegitation grows the year round, which gives the face of the country a beautiful aspect.   ation of these Islands to the United States but after we arrived here we did not hear much about it, and I ENDENTRY    But if you do repent and turn to the Lord, with all your heart, then you shall be ab- undantly blessed, and rejoice in the way of salvation in your old age. I ask can it  be possible that you have willingly cast away the sweet influencies of the Gifts of the Spirit of  God, in exchange for those things which are caral, vain, sinful, and degrading in  their nature? How long will you strive to lock out of the Church, the wisdom and power of God, to make room for the display of your carnal performances? I wonder that you have  been so much like the children of Israel anciently, their prophet Moses desired that they  should sanctify themselves, but they would not come up to that hight standard of perfec- tion, so he gave them a law of carnal commandments. ##Exodus 34## Has it not been so with you in these days? Would you choose to appear before our Savior as the advocate and defen- der of a law of carnal commandments instead of being an advocate and defender of  the Gospel of Jesus Christ?  If so, then I ask you where is that substancial manhood, and independence of character, that should adorn every one that will have the honor, of being  called valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ? Have you been so high minded as to over- look the above priceless stamp of human character? I look with admiration upon the manhood and independence of character manifested in the life of our Savior, and others  I could name; but a perverted manhood and independence, I despise. I ask what can  be the reason that it appears by your condict, that you can not afford the time, to write or  speak to your fellow man, when you think him below your rank of honor? Where did  you find such an example of perverted aristocratic pride, in the Gospel of Christ?  We have such as the above example, given by them of old, who persecuted and killed  the prophets, and them that God had sent to them. Would you also follow after them?  I have never refused to speak or reason, on the fair and grand platform of equality,  with any of my fellow men, be they high or low; in the esteemation of other men.

Awaiting Yours respect,     ENDENTRY  soon, as the present King is very much opposed to it. He think that the inhabitants of the Islands will be considered no better than negros by Americans from the fact that while traviling in the United States he was once called a niger by some one that did not know him, the King is about 21 years old but looks much older. The laws of this Kingdom do not appear to be such, as the necessities of the people require, but tend rather to promote the very evils they were intended to prevent.   me, if  you could find the time &amp; opportunity of writing. Bro. Molen wishes to be remembered to you.   I subscribe myself respectfuly your Brother in the Gospel       that reside upon these Islands. I saw my cousin at Honolulu but did not have much conversation with him, as he is quite deaf and did not appear very much  I have not been to see her yet, but shall in the cource of a few weeks.   ENDENTRY    we are offering an insult to man, and dishonor to God, which is a sin. I have never  received my endowments from no man, God gave me my endowments and the Keys of knowledge and power, when I received the Gifts of the Holy Ghost. Have you lived  all these years, trusting in the things that others received? Instead of reaching forth your  hand by the power of faith and partake of the blessings of life freely, this was your priviledge.  The power that comes through the gifts of God would enable the Saints to stand valiant for  the work of God against all the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil, it would en- able to discern between right and wrong in all things, and to seperate truth from error  wherever found. They would be known because their intelligence would shine forth,  as the stars of heaven, do upon the surrounding darkness, they would be the light of the world and the salt of the earth.  They would attract the attention of all respectable people by  their undersanding, wisdom, love, mercy, justice, righteousness, truth, power, and judgement. They would reign with God forever and ever, because they would be one  with Him and His Son Jesus Christ. What can you do with the promise of Joseph  the prophet that God would send one, to set His house in Order, this work is sadly needed now. And again the promise as follows: "Behold I say unto you, the redemption of Zion must  needs come by power; therefore, I will raise up unto my people a man, who shall lead them like as Moses led the Children of Israel," ##Doctrine and Covenants 103:16## and so forth. I am pleading with you for the  restoreation of the original order of the house of God, and also the restoreation of the  same power and blessings, that was manifested in the administration of Jesus Christ,  and His Apostles in former days. How long do you suppose that you will be suffered by  the Almightly to stop His work to go forward on the earth? The reason for writeing to  you so plain and direct, is in order to penetrate the thick darkness, that has enveloped  the slumbering condition of your Souls. The Almighty has according to His mercy ENDENTRY    would my father were he alive to try to help me, pray for me &amp; may that channel of commu- nication that is open between you &amp; the Heavens be opened for my benefit that my fasting &amp; prayers may not be in vain &amp; that my children may not have to suffer longer for the want of a mother's care. I fear so much for my mind for it is ^in^ a dreadful state &amp; it seems impossible to endure it much longer unless the Lord looks down in tender mercy upon me &amp; restores me to health; which  I have had faith He would do for the sake of my helpless children &amp; because of long labor among the children of the Saints which has con- tinued more or less from the time I was 15 yrs old.

Will you continue to try to stop the ful- fillment of the above promise? That would raise or lift you up out of the mass of corruption,  that has made itself manifest in the Church in this generation. If you have any portion  of the spirit of God abiding in you, then you will understand, and see the necessity of re- ceiving the things I have written unto you, for these things are true and faithful, and will  stand forever. But if you do not receive these things and continue to hinder and stop the  work I have described to you, if this will be your course of action against the Lord,  you shall be mooved out of the way by Him. Yea and all the bitter and stifnecked ones  in the Church will if they do not repent be moved out of the way, even all the high, proud,  and exalted branches that produce nothing but wild grapes, they have drawn to them- selves the substance and strength of the more humble vines in the vineyard of the Lord.  The Lord's time is at hand and nothing can remain to hinder Him. I ask you as  I would a father, to turn away from all that is evil, while there is a way open for  you.
