I have been  very busy in building me a house and in preaching the gospel. Away from home I seldom could find a decent pen, or a half sheet of clean paper. I have written a little through necessity and a very little only. I might urge many other reasons for not writing sooner, but none for want of a disposition to write. I have not had time even to write a love letter, however strong my in- clinations may have been to do so. I never labor ed with body and mind more intently in my life than during the past season. I Am now reduced to the size of a decent man. But my house is so far finished that my goods are pitched into it, and have left my family to regulate for themselves while I go to Fillmore where I  expect to be on New Years night.

But I have at last come to the conclusion that you ought to know all. You will then understand my position and know how to remember me before the Lord and perhaps you may be sumwhat surprised at  what I am about to reveal to you At the death of Joseph  you are well aware their was a strugling for power among certain men in America ^have^ you have felt the wait of this  truth, in Zion So have I in Liverpool among men from whom I looked for better things viz T Ward Their has been one Evil in this church from the Begining give men a little extra power and influence for a season when it is called for they are not willing to give it up or fill their own place and sustain men in theirs at least I have found it so here I will now give you a statement of facts as near as I can in truth since my arival in Liverpool.

After I settled that up I advised him to take charge of some conference for a season untill their was a better feeling at Liverpool. I made my  Address to the churches though the Star and had my recommend published with it that the Saints might know that I came with Authority from Head the proper Source I  saw that Br Hedlok and Ward seemed to he much troubled about their standing so I made choice of them for councillors out of respect to the men and their former standing, thinking they would operate with me, their was nothing through the  Star but what all was right but the more I advanced toward my place as president to take charge of things and direct them the more I found a spirit against it and secretiveness in all things Esspecially with Br Hedlock and Br Ward had so much of John Bull in him that it seemed at times that it was of more consequence to him than the priesthood, and as out of the heart the mouth speaketh I soon sayw things in their hearts not right if I could judge from the causes they were  persuing their feelings was we have power and influence and we  will hold it.

But it is all repaired. I regret the losses sustained by our Brethren in the North, yet I am thankful that no human lives were lost.

It is like all improvements in Manti, unfineshed.

R. W. Sloan, Esq.,  Chicago.  Dear Brother:  Your favor of the 13th. inst., written at Minneapolis,  has just been received and read with interest. Since our last reply to you we have  received several papers containing interviews with you.  We see nothing objectionable in your statements, when we  consider the duties that you have assumed. In any other capacity than that in which  you are acting, of course, different statements would be made. If you had not ac- cepted the position, doubtless some other person would have done so who would perhaps have made much broader statements than you have made, without giving information that would mitigate the bad effect, so far as our people are concerned. If you  should be judged harshly by some who do not take into consideration all the circum- stances, or who may not know the motive you had in accepting the position which you occupy, it will not be the first time that motives have been misconstrued and wrong  judgements formed upon us; but we do not anticipate that there will be much of this.  We are glad to hear that Dr. Miller, our old-time friend,  still feels so kindly towards us and our rights. He has been, so far as we know, a  constant and an undeviating friend and a liberal-minded man. When you return you  ENDENTRY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST. OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS,  P. O.

I have no disposition to injure Elder ward I wish them well, though they have not taken a wise course in all things since I came.

ENDENTRY sideways text  A. E. Hinckley. Hackberry Jan 31 1883  end of sideways text  For President John Taylor.  Hackbery, Jan. 15th, 1883.  President Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  I sit down to drop you a few lines. You will excuse the bad gram- mar, spelling, without any punctuation, passing over all, until we come to this place. On the 26th of Dec. last we arrived at this place, and found a portion of the  Wallapais tribe of Indians here, and added to their low and filthy condition, the corruption and diseases of civ- ilization and, in looking forward to the time when the Lord would fulfil his promises upon them, I realized that it was the Lord's work, and that He would have to work by his power, manifest in their midst, to bring it about. I learned that this nation had no place to gather to, to farm and till the earth. The whites have taken up the watering places, and the Indians, in many places where they used to be the lords of the soil, have to pay to water their horses now. The government has stopped giving them rations and they are in a bad condition. Still, the chief refuses to accept of our going to any place with them, to learn them to farm, or school their children. He says that they were on the reservation a few years, their children to school, many of them died, and he would rather they would live, hunt rabbits, work for the Americans, cut wood, wash dishes, and so forth, than gather together, be sick and die,  and he does not want us to come there with anything of the  and have not done so. They appear always to remember a  promise. Our promise is to write to the Mormon Chief,  and he will do as he thinks best, and Brother Harris is to meet them and report to them whether there is any one comes or not, and, if not, to tell them the reason why. There is large tracts of good land on the Colorado River, above and below Fort Mojave. The Shemojaves are situated in their valley about 60 miles below the Fort. There is some good land in their valley, but most of the tribe is below there, on the reservation on the California side, 50 miles below their valley, and a portion of the Mojave tribe is on this side the river, oppo- site them, on their reservation. The location is good to reach them and the Wallapais in the Mojave Valley, and this Chief that can read and write we think will be of great benefit to the cause, if he obeys the Gospel. The promises made to them, the Mojaves, was 20 years ago, or more, yet they told us of it. This shows that they never forget, so that we made ours con- ditional, as I said. Told them that the Lord had told our Chief to send us out to tell them to be at peace with all, to become one with us, to learn to do good, be brothers together. I guess that I have written enough in my wandering way this time. Hope that I shall be able to say more in less words in the future.  With love and peace to all, We remain, your brothers in the Gospel, A. E. Hinckley. ENDENTRY I am a priest whose life in different parts of America and Europe, has been crowned with success, yet should I  believe that I could be of any avail to your sacred cause, I would not hesitate to leave the Catholic laurels to others and to go under your guidance fight the good fight for your divine Faith, because I am yours, heart and soul. But, owing, I presume, to my feeling my present un- worthyness, I do but present you and your dear family and your people with my greatest Sympathy and ENDENTRY kind at present. He says that he may know better after a while, but until then this is his decision positive now. The tribe is fast wasting away with venereal diseases. There appears to be no place to commence with them, but to work with their neighbors. We have been to the Mojave tribe. They wish you to send some families to come and  work with them, teach them better how to farm and school their children. They make two propositions—one, to go with some of them and clear some land, 20 miles below St. Mojave;  another, on a piece of land above the fort, about four miles, which is cleared, which the River overflows, and is sure of making a crop. The land below is not safe or sure without digging wells and putting up windmills. The land in both places is very rich. The land below belongs to government and the Railroad. That above is at present occupied by the head Chief. The chiefs are very anxious, and also the people, to  have some of our people to come, and we think that it is one of the best chances of bringing about the work with them. Brother Harris has promised to be back there in four months. He expresses himself that he would like to go and settle there, as he says that they are the finest tribe in this Territory. They are a very industrious people, but they have become very much diseased and are somewhat under the control of the whites, but there is no denomination or sect among them. The second chief can read and write. We left with him the Book  of Mormon. His name is Mariman. If you can send  him the book, address it to him, Mariman, a Chief of  Mojave Indians, Fort Mojave. He is a well disposed man. He says that he wants to do right when he knows what right is. We think that he will be a very useful man in the future. We think that 2 or 3 families at each place could do great good. Brother Harris will be there about the first of May, and if you think that  it is wise to send some Elders to meet him there, either with or without their families, to commence work with them, you will please let us know at Mesa. Direct in care of Pres. A. F. MacDonald. If they come, the most direct road will be by St. George, Pearce's Ferry, from thence to Mineral Park, from there to Fort Mojave. We send this by way of suggestion. Brother Harris will meet them, the Chiefs, whether anyone is sent or not. It will be as you, the Council say, whether he stops with them or not. He has said as much, that he would like to do so, if he could be as useful there as otherwise. He is a very zealous man. As to myself, to be a travelling missionary than to be located in a tribe, and indeed I believe with such a man as Ephraim Hanks, if we were as well united in faith and feelings as we were when we were out to meet the hand-cart company, that we would be will- ing to keep on south among the Lamanites until we come to the end of them, if we could live faithful enough to do so. The Mojaves say that the Mormons have been to their tribe twice and promised to come back, ENDENTRY my warmest feelings for the final success of the cause of the Mormon faith. The  sufferings of the Saints are the seed of the Church. So far the persecution has stren- ghtened your Church.— Let us hope for the future!—  I shall be very glad to hear from you that you have  received this letter.

I greatly fear for their inexperiance in the world, that some harm may come on them if some known Friend like Sister Woodruff does not assist me in this affair.  They both love you better than any one they ever saw before, they will therefore listen to your advice, and be ready to do what you think right, under these circumstances I am induced to solicit your assistance and I hope you will watch what companions they choose and advise them when they go rong.

ENDENTRY Wrexham Monday 26 Feby. 1845  Dr Br Woodruff,  I have neglected writing until now, expecting to have the better news to give you, because I had some forebodings of glorious consequences. Of course Br. Stratton told you how I was getting on up to the time of his departure. Since then I have been working my way into the heart of the Welsh Colleries, and Ironworks, but have found my way blocked up, by the  preposesed prejudices, predicated upon the ffalse statements of returning Apostates as well as all other lies that any Impostors, or bad men have ever ben guilty of, all the stories I think that the Devil and his Priests can think of, are sent the rounds here too, but as luck wd have it, by being a little sly I scaled some of their Ramparts before they were aware, and I hope, have put in a little leaven but the Priests here are not doing much else, but consulting together what to do with me, the first thing of cours was to turn me out of the good old synagouge  and caution all their sheep, not to believe, or talk to me, they would not allow me to give my reasons for leaving them, but through the influence of a friend, I got posses- ition of one of ^their^ sanctuarys last Sabbath ^week^ about 5 miles from here, and got my own play for the time, but since then the deacon has been under the eeves of that Sanctum but since Br. Stratton left I have prepared a work for the press, principally about the order ^of^ the Kingdom set up in the days of the Apostles, and illustrating the first principles, the immutability of the Gospel andc something similar to P. P. Pratts, on ^the^ Kingdom, in the voice of warning, but Welsh of course, twil be in pamplet form about two sheets, or 48 pages, of twelve fold, close type, they wanted £16 pn 1000  but tomorrow I have ^to^ go and see another printer, and will make a trade with him for a thousand copies ^for something less^ and get him to print them in two weeks, I have to depend on  you to send me that amt, by that time, for I need not expect any quarters from any source, neither would I have any one know here my financial affairs, upon any consideration, I have had to steer between wind and water, with friend and foe, and carry ^a^ stiff upper lip, for I have to pay my board here and wife. My wife's illness has kept me here rather confined, and while this work is going through the Press I will have to be here to correct the proof sheets, but have some open hearted friends in Wales, who have invited me to see them, some dozen miles off or so, them of cours I will attend too, in the mean time, but after I get this workout I will take a larger circuit, especially after conference. I am glad withal they are making such a stir among the^mse^lves, on my act. here, I expect my wifes ilness will be ofver before I come to conference, and I hope that by then, the object I had hinted to Br S. about, will be acomplished, all right thus far, andc Would I had a mate, who would go shoulder to shoulder with me in the Welsh! But I have a prospect of one before long, one who has his hand in, but tho, I shd remain alone I am resolved in the strength of Joseph's God, to die on the field of battle, rather  than meet my kindred on that day, and found guilty of their blood, poor people, they know not  what they are doing. the best way of remittance will bye by post office.

Wilford Woodruff and The Quorum of The Twelve Apostles:  Dear Brethren:  Agreeable to the wishes of the family of the late Pres. John Taylor and also in response to a desire on our part to see a proper biographical and chrono- logical history of his life presented to the public we have thought providing the matter meets your approval and concurrence of publishing, at an early a day as possible, a biograpy of his life, together with such contemporaneous history, memoirs etc. as space and the scope of the work will permit.  With reference to the propriety of the publication of such a work, it is perhaps unnecessary for us to offer any special argument; but it seems to us that the issuance of such a work would fill a two or three-fold mission. The people, we believe, would not only welcomely receive any work which would properly recount the incidents and lessons of the life of such a man as their late ENDENTRY Chas. A. Dean. May 25 1896. ENDENTRY HOME. FAMILY. ESTABLISHED 1879. 35,000 Members.  A GREAT FRATERNAL ORDER. The Order of Chosen Friends. ITS OBJECTS AND PLANS.  The Order of Chosen Friends is a Fraternal Benevolent and Protective Society. Its business is conducted privately, yet in such a manner that those conscientiously opposed to secret societies can endorse and affiliate with it.  It was established May 28, 1879, in the city of Indianapolis, Indiana. It has now over 700 Councils and 35,000 members in the United States and Canada. It is an Order making provisions for paying, in addition to sick and death benefits, one to its aged members, and also providing for a benefit to those who become totally disabled by reason of either disease or accident. It has met with the approval and endorsement of the think- ing public. The success and growth of the Chosen Friends in the past, confirms the wisdom of its projectors, and the adaptability of the Order to meet the wants of thousands who are without any, or need more, protection.  The Order is representative in its management, having a Democratic-Republican form of govern- ment. It is in fact, a sovereignty within itself; self-controlling and independent. Within its own prescribed sphere its authority is supreme. Its members acquiesce in the teachings of its faith, and are required to yield obedience to its laws. Friendship and fraternal co-operation is the cen- tral principle by which it is governed, the power 2  that gives potency to its resolves. The perpetu- ation of the Order depends upon an adhesion to the established principles of its ritual and its fundamental laws, and upon the recognition by Chosen Friends of the great principles of Fra- ternity, Aid and Protection. The distinctive features are briefly stated in the following  OBJECTS OF THE ORDER:  1. To unite fraternally acceptable white per- sons of good character, steady habits, sound bodily health and reputable calling, who believe in a  Supreme Being.  2. To improve their condition morally, socially  and materially, by timely counsel and instructive lessons; encouragement in business, and assist- ance to obtain employment when in need.  3. To establish a Relief Fund from which a sum not exceeding three thousand dollars ($3,000) shall be paid:  a. When a member becomes disabled by the infirmities of old age: Provided, the age of seventy-five years has been reached.  b. When by reason of disease or accident, a member becomes permanently disabled from fol- lowing any occupation.  c. When a member has died.  SECURITY OF THE ORDER.  The history of kindred fraternal societies proves that the plighted faith of the members of an organization who are bound in honor and self- interest to maintain its integrity, can be relied upon for protection and good faith quite as con- fidently as business companies managed by men whose interests are in natural conflict with those of their patrons. The co-operation of men and women for mutual protection, on an equitable and economical basis, is a matter of prudence, justified by our daily experience.  The Order has three divisions; these are: 1. Supreme Council. 2. Grand Councils and Districts. 3. Subordinate Councils. 3 ENDENTRY St George 3rd March 1881  President Wilford Woodruff  Prsent: Dear Brother  By permission of Sister Goldthait Newel night, I have copied the following from the original which is in frame under glass, at Josephs own hand writing.

From this body emanate all laws for the govern- ment of the Order, and to it is entrusted the en- tire management of the Relief Fund.  Subordinate Councils are local organizations for the extension of the Order in their immediate vicinity. They have the power to solicit, accept and reject members who are admitted on petition, by ballot. Every applicant for membership must be over eighteen years of age, of good moral char- acter, steady habits, reputable calling, sound bodily health, and believe in a Supreme Being.  The admission of members is guarded by pro- tective rules similar to those of the Masonic, Odd Fellows, and other successful fraternal organiza- tions, and for beneficiary membership by a  thorough medical examination of each candidate.  Beneficiary membership is optional with the member. The Subordinate Council is expected to provide for the social, moral and intellectual improvement of its members, for the relief of the sick, for the assistance of those out of employ- ment, for the encouragement of its members in business, and for the inculcation and dissemina- tion of the principles of Fraternity, Aid and Pro- tection. By-Laws to accomplish this are framed by each Council as desired.  Meetings are held weekly or semi-monthly and members must pay dues quarterly in advance. Each Council fixes the amount to be paid as dues. One dollar per quarter is recommended, if Coun- cil does not pay sick benefits.  HOW COUNCILS ARE INSTITUTED.  Subordinate Councils are organized by the Supreme Councilor, or his representatives ap- pointed for that purpose, on the application of twenty or more persons possessing the necessary qualifications, and who agree, by ballot, at the time of organization, to associate with each other in fraternal relation.  This Order permits an unlimited membership on the Charter list Strong Councils, with a large mem- bership in each, are preferred. 4  MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS.  A rigid medical examination is required by an authorized Medical Examiner, and the applica- cation must be approved by the Supervising Medical Examiner before the member can be- come beneficiary.  EXPENSE OF ORGANIZATION.  No Charter fee is required. A set of supplies sufficient usually to last the Council for several months, and most of the books will last for years, is furnished free. The membership fee is $5.00.  This fee, each applicant for beneficiary mem- bership must pay, and it covers  Medical Examiner's Fee As agreed upon Supervising Medical Examiner's Fee $0.50 Certificate Fee 1.00 Balance is placed in Council Treasury.  In addition to the $5.00 above mentioned, each beneficiary member must pay one advance Assess- ment, according to age and amount of Relief Fund Certificate (see table of rates).  Social members are not required to pay Medi- cal Examiner's fee or assessments, but must pay a Certificate fee of $1.00; which certificate can be exchanged for a Relief Fund Certificate should  the member become beneficiary within one year from the date of initiation.  The membership fee must be paid to the Sec- retary; Medical Examiner's fees and Supreme Medical Examiner's fees, to the Medical Exami- ner; all other fees, to the Secretary of the Coun- cil, to be applied as directed by the Constitutions and Laws.  RELIEF FUND.  There is connected with this Order a Relief Fund, from which each member, or the properly designated beneficiary, is entitled, under the pre- scribed regulations, to draw a sum not exceeding the amount named in the Relief Fund Certificate.  These certificates are issued either in the amount of five hundred, one, two or three thou- sand dollars, as the member applying for the same may elect, subject, however, to the approval 5 ENDENTRY my dearly beloved brethren after a considerably lengthy Journey I avail myself of the first opportunity of communicating to you a knowlede of our situation that you may be privileged of writing to us for we have not heard any thing from you since since we left you last fall. we arrived  arrived at this place a few days since which is about 25 from the Shawnee Indi^ans^ on the south side of the Kanzas river at its mouth and Deleware on the North I have had two interviews and Deleware ^interviews^ on the N with the chief of the Delewares who is a very old and venerable looking man.

Beneficiary members are required to pay into the Relief Fund an amount, graded according to age, as follows:  TABLE OF RATES.  AT THE AGES OF ON $500. ON $1,000. ON $2,000. ON $3,000.     18 and 25, incl., $0.35 $0.70 $1.40 $2.10      26 and 30, incl., .40 .80 1.60 2.40   31 and 35, incl. .45 .90 1.80 2.70   36 and 40, incl. .50 1.00 2.00 3.00   41 and 45, incl. .60 1.20 2.40 3.60   46 and 50, incl. .75 1.50 3.00 4.50   51 and 54, incl. 1.00 2.00 4.00 6.00    And this amount, paid by the applicant on applying for a Relief Fund Certificate, remains his or her Assessment for life (or until 75 years of age), and is paid, without notice or demand, on the first day of each calendar month, except when the Assessment is remitted, which is done when the amount in the Relief Fund is sufficient to pay all claims that are, or may be, presented during the succeeding month.  Up to July 1, 1894, this Order has issued 90,000 Relief Fund Certificates to members. It has received and disbursed for its objects $8,500,000.00. It is now paying benefits at the rate of about $3,000 every day in the year.  SECURITY OF FUNDS.  All officers of the Order who have charge of any of its funds are required to give sufficient  bond for the faithful discharge of their duties. These bonds may be increased from time to time, and are always in a sum not less than double the amount the officer will probably at any time have in his hands. In addition to these safeguards, such an arrangement has been made with the banks where the Relief Fund is deposited that it can only be drawn on the regular Relief Fund warrants, thus putting it out of the power of the officers to use it for any purpose except to pay death and disability benefits. 6  YELLOW FEVER.  This Order does not extend into the yellow fever districts, as Councils are not allowed to be organized in the States of Arkansas, Florida, and portions of Georgia, in which that disease has prevailed.  SUMMARY.  The Order of Chosen Friends combines the fol- lowing substantial benefits and advantages: 1. Death benefits of from $500 to $3,000. 2. Disability benefits of from $250 to $1,500. 3. Old age benefits of from $500 to $3,000. 4. Sick benefits of $5 or more a week. 5. It admits males and females to member- ship with equal privileges. 6. It secures more benefits for less money than any other Order. 7. It is the great family Order of the country. The family is the greatest institution in the world, and an Order that incorporates that insti- tution into itself is destined to become the strong- est in the world.  CONCLUSION.  This Order offers the surest way to prevent the household loaf from being buried with the house- hold head. It helps to rid the community of pauperism and of the crimes incident to poverty.

In your Epistle you give your testimony about what the prophet Joseph taught you and the Twelve Apostles before his death, and the keys, endowments, blessings, and powers you received from him, and that he appointed no one but the Twelve that should have authority to lead the Church, and you are the last of that Twelve, that heared these things. It is now over forty 40 years since that time and you are the last of that wasTwelve that was left by Joseph to lead the Church. Even forty years is a long time to wait for that, that may be compared to a great river of corru- ption and wickedness that did spring from the unbelief and carnal desires of the people that are now nearly all passed away. The darkness of that unbelief was terrible to behold,  in it many of the sheep of the fold has been scattered to an fro, here and there, and almost every where. Are you not satisfied with the past experience and misery of this people?

I did think that what I wrote to you before was plain enough for almost any one to understand, but at this time, I shall try to write still plainer to you,  so that you ^may^ have a better understanding conserning the things that will come to pass.  I am sorry that the Chuch was in such a lamentable condition of unbelief, at the time you  testify that you and the Twelve got your endowments, keys, blessings, and powers, from Joseph Smith the prophet. If you had been faithful to God as you should have been, instead of receiveing your endowments from man, you could have a greater blessing from God, even  the gifts of the Holy Ghost, as they did on the day of Jerusalem; you could  have the promise of the Savior made good to you, so well as them; See the last chapter of  Mark as follows: "And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they  cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they  drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they  shall recover." xx ##Mark 16:17-18## "And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working  with them, and confirming the word with signs following." See also the teaching of Paul the apostle in first Corinthians and 12th chapter on spiritual Gifts. ##I Corinthians 12## I call your attention to these things because you appear as if you had forgotten  them, in your great zeal to establish an other order of things in the Church. Through  your transgressions you have lost much of the powers of heaven, you have exchanged the blessings of heaven for the things of the earth, instead of being spiritually minded,  you have become carnally minded, and have addopted a law of carnal com- mandments, instead of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. What has become of the spirit- ual Gifts that was given by the God of heaven, with the Everlasting Gospel in the  beginning, when it was restored in its fullness to man on the earth? Did you and the  Twelve Apostles all agree and join together, to stop the Saints that had these gifts to use them? If you did have a voice or vote to that effect, you are under condemnation.

The Saints  had sacrifised all earthly pleasures, leaveing their homes and relations and endureing insults, dishonor, and persecution, for the sake of secureing the favor and gifts of the Eternal  God, according to the promise of His Son, but to their grief and dissappointment when  they arrived among the mountains of Utah, instead of being encouraged in their  spiritual course of righteousness, their attention was called to a law of carnal com- mandments doing away with that which was spiritual, even those things that was their  comfort, and consolation, that enabled them to endure all their aflictions, and tribulations, even the grandest and greatest gifts of God to man, that they relied on in life, or in death, in time, or in eternity, even the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Where was that love and sym- pathy that you should have for your brothers and sisters, when you caused them  to stop useing the gifts of the gospel of Christ? The greatest comfort they had in the  world was taken from them at that time, the Gifts that enabled them to commune with the Great Father and Son, through the Holy Ghost, the saints was hindered  from useing.

Islands Feb. 7th 1855  Brother Woodruff  Dear Sir  In compliance with your request, I will endeavor to improve the present opportunity by writing a few lines to you. With a few slight exceptions I have enjoyed good health since leaving the valley. I presume you are aware of our delay at California, which was occasioned by circumstances that we were unable to control, therefore I believe it was all right. I landed at Caine and Johnson, being the last that arrived, of the Breathren that were ^appointed^ to this mission, by the last April conference. I stayed in Honolulu untill after the funeral of the old successor, which took place on the 10th and 11th of Jan. The funeral procession was a sple- ndid affair and reflected much credit on the Kingdom. As this Island had been designated as my future field of labor, myself and Bro. Whitney (who was also appointed to this Isdland) took the steamer on the 12th and arrived at this Island the morning of the 13th and amediatly commenced the task of learning the native language. Bros. R. A. Allred and Molen are upon this Island. Bro. Molen has been here about three months, he can talk some but has not a sufficient knowledge of the language to preach much yet, but is making rapid progress, the young Breathren generaly are making are obtaining the language very readily, some of them have commenced preaching. Judging from the length of time that I have been here, Bro. Molen thinks I will get the language pretty quick, but it is tedious for a person that has not been accustomed to confine their mind to any one thing. The Breathren that were here when the last lot came, will all probably leave for home, after our July ENDENTRY Emma Day Oct 23rd 1849  Answered Nov 9th 49  Advised them to write to O Hyde and get advice ENDENTRY 4 of spiritual power from Him who is Almightly, but to our sorrow instead of geting more abundantly of the fruit of righteousness, even that portion we had was made inactive or inoperative through your Order of things. The nurishment that is necessary for a spiritual increase has been stopped, the result is a spiritual weakness causeing  many to be discouraged and fall by the way unheeded and unaided by many that pass by. The young people among us have not been accustomed to see nor feel  the power of God manifested through the Gifts of the Spirit, the most of them depend on  the words of others, instead of getting a Knowledge for themselves from God. Hence the  urgent necessity of granting me and others that desire, the priviledge and right to  preach the fullness of the Gospel, as it was restored in its purity from God, to man in these  last days. I hope that the end of all that is dark corrupt and miserable is at hand, and  that the dawning of a brighter day will soon spread its glory over the world, when  the Gifts of the Holy Ghost which is the power of the Everlasting Gospel, will be  enjoyed by all those that believe in it.  There is thousands of honest people in these  mountains that would be willing and thankful to have the priviledge to live  according to the fullness of the Gospel, and would rejoice and give glory to God in the hightest, if they had the gifts of the Holy Ghost according to the promise of  Jesus Christ. If you deem yourselves unworthy to receive the Gifts of the Holy Ghost,  according to the pattern given in the Holy scriptures, then you should step aside to make room for them that have faith, that God can and will bring about a  restoreation, of all the gifts and powers that has been lost to you by transgression, but  secured to all that have faith in the unchangeable covenant of the Everlasting Gospel.

Islands generaly speaking, although the faith of the saints areis weak in some places, they are a weak minded people and unless continualy stired up will become slack and negligent. at one branch where I stayed a couple of weeks, the Presiding Elder and a number of the members threatened to leave the Church in consequence of having to feed us, but there are many good saints here, that are willing to do all they can for the Elders, but after all the Elders have a great many difficulties to encounter as the natives are so poor it is almost impossible to get the means to defray the expences of going to the different Islands, to attend conference andc. But when a servent of God goes out in the world to procl- aim the principles of  eternal life, they naturaly expect to to see hard times. I fancy they do not expect the same kind of fare that they receive at home in the valleys of the mou- ntains, at least I did not, I expected to pass through some pretty tight places, and ^to^ undergo hardships and suffer privations, if I do not have to suffer anything but should receive my pay as I go along of course I should not expect to be rewarded hereafter, my prayer is continualy that the Lord will streangthen me and enable me to be the instrument in his hands of accomplishing some good in this Kingdom. It appears to be a difficult task to better the condition of this people in their present condition situation, surrounded with the influences that dos surround them.  This is a splendid country and in the hands of an enterp- rising people could no doubt be made very productive, vegitation grows the year round, which gives the face of the country a beautiful aspect.

But if you do repent and turn to the Lord, with all your heart, then you shall be ab- undantly blessed, and rejoice in the way of salvation in your old age. I ask can it  be possible that you have willingly cast away the sweet influencies of the Gifts of the Spirit of  God, in exchange for those things which are caral, vain, sinful, and degrading in  their nature? How long will you strive to lock out of the Church, the wisdom and power of God, to make room for the display of your carnal performances? I wonder that you have  been so much like the children of Israel anciently, their prophet Moses desired that they  should sanctify themselves, but they would not come up to that hight standard of perfec- tion, so he gave them a law of carnal commandments. ##Exodus 34## Has it not been so with you in these days? Would you choose to appear before our Savior as the advocate and defen- der of a law of carnal commandments instead of being an advocate and defender of  the Gospel of Jesus Christ?  If so, then I ask you where is that substancial manhood, and independence of character, that should adorn every one that will have the honor, of being  called valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ? Have you been so high minded as to over- look the above priceless stamp of human character? I look with admiration upon the manhood and independence of character manifested in the life of our Savior, and others  I could name; but a perverted manhood and independence, I despise. I ask what can  be the reason that it appears by your condict, that you can not afford the time, to write or  speak to your fellow man, when you think him below your rank of honor? Where did  you find such an example of perverted aristocratic pride, in the Gospel of Christ?  We have such as the above example, given by them of old, who persecuted and killed  the prophets, and them that God had sent to them. Would you also follow after them?

That there is no reference made whatever ^relative^ to the commen- icement of the late civil war and that the prophecy is only contained in editions sub- sequent to the war.  The question has been recently agitated in our religious meetings and there has been no sattisf- actory solution in accounting for the omission of the prophecy in the editions of the Doctrine and Covenants previous to the war.

I have never  received my endowments from no man, God gave me my endowments and the Keys of knowledge and power, when I received the Gifts of the Holy Ghost. Have you lived  all these years, trusting in the things that others received? Instead of reaching forth your  hand by the power of faith and partake of the blessings of life freely, this was your priviledge.  The power that comes through the gifts of God would enable the Saints to stand valiant for  the work of God against all the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil, it would en- able to discern between right and wrong in all things, and to seperate truth from error  wherever found. They would be known because their intelligence would shine forth,  as the stars of heaven, do upon the surrounding darkness, they would be the light of the world and the salt of the earth.  They would attract the attention of all respectable people by  their undersanding, wisdom, love, mercy, justice, righteousness, truth, power, and judgement. They would reign with God forever and ever, because they would be one  with Him and His Son Jesus Christ. What can you do with the promise of Joseph  the prophet that God would send one, to set His house in Order, this work is sadly needed now. And again the promise as follows: "Behold I say unto you, the redemption of Zion must  needs come by power; therefore, I will raise up unto my people a man, who shall lead them like as Moses led the Children of Israel," ##Doctrine and Covenants 103:16## and so forth. I am pleading with you for the  restoreation of the original order of the house of God, and also the restoreation of the  same power and blessings, that was manifested in the administration of Jesus Christ,  and His Apostles in former days. How long do you suppose that you will be suffered by  the Almightly to stop His work to go forward on the earth?

But if you do not receive these things and continue to hinder and stop the  work I have described to you, if this will be your course of action against the Lord,  you shall be mooved out of the way by Him. Yea and all the bitter and stifnecked ones  in the Church will if they do not repent be moved out of the way, even all the high, proud,  and exalted branches that produce nothing but wild grapes, they have drawn to them- selves the substance and strength of the more humble vines in the vineyard of the Lord.  The Lord's time is at hand and nothing can remain to hinder Him. I ask you as  I would a father, to turn away from all that is evil, while there is a way open for  you. I desire in the name of Jesus Christ that this letter will be consecrated by the Almighty  for the salvation of many souls.  Respectfully David M. Williams  Malad City Idaho Ter.

Now the voice of the spirit was telling me that I should go into the Temple to get my healing and forgiveness of my sins. I felt some doubts about going and the voice tolld me to writte to you as you are the Lord's anointed Prophet and Seer, and that you would tell me through the Lord what I should do. Therefore I shall await your answer and remain most respectfully your humble brother in the Gospel of Christ.  H.

Business generally is dull here. I see nothing at present to make it an object for me to remain, with money any one can make money here. Cows and horses are selling well here. I have an idea of sending some across next  season. Mr. Rollins one of the men I came from Salt Lake with will come with them, and perhaps Free dom may be interested, if so he will come across fair cows are selling for from 125 to 175$ each. it costs but a trifle you know to get them here  Bro. Smoot is familiar with buying stock in the western States. Will you please give him my respects and ask him where the best place is to buy good first rate cows, whether it would be advisable to go so far as Illinois, and if it would be well to drive calves across with the cows, andc.  I hope to recieve letters from you before I leave this place. will you please write me and ask Phebe to write by first mail to the States. I feel anxious to know how the emegration is getting in. what your prospects are andc. Col.

I am as you will perceive still here at Scarboro, and of course doing nothing, which I find exceedingly hard work. I want much to make you a visit and see your country of which you give so flattering an account and have delayed writing you for a time in hopes of being able to say def anitely to you whether I should make the attempt this coming spring or not, but as yet I am unable to decide as it depends upon circumstances beyond my control. Ms. Curtus continued indisposition is one great objection to my leaving home, her health is very poor indeed, we thought some two months since that she would live but a short time, she is now better but very delicate, should there be a favorable change of circumstances, I shall leave this spring but at present it is quite un- certain how matters may result.  upside-down text Sept. 13 and Nov. 1st we just recd.

I was sorry to hear that money con tinues so scarce with you as it is very neces- sary in business affairs. You have given me so many flattering accounts of your romantic and prosperous country that I cannot longer resist the temptation of making you a visit. I now intend leaving Independence with the mail in the first of May as that will be the most expeditious way of crossing the plains, shall probably go to Kanesvill first and see how Elder Hyde is getting along with those goods.  You have written so discourageingly about the sale of goods at Utah in the last letters I have received from you, and not having been advised by you to forward any to your city have concluded to not take any, but cross with the mail in some small company that ENDENTRY Hyrum Oakey will go on his Mission Sept 27 1887  Accepts Mission ENDENTRY I have put away all foolish nonsense  of life and have retired into an Italian  village, called Giais-Selva, where the suitable  climate for orchards and the raising of fruit, as also the utter retirement from the noise  of the world, corresponds with my feelings, and  where I have obtained my own property. Here, at the foot of the Venetian Alps -- only  surrounded by peasants, I have found, that  the spirit of man gains that freshness and  strength necessary to distinguish Truth from Error. To be short, I can say that the Church of Jesus  Christ of L. D. Saints is the only true religion  for humanity in this time and age of the world, that ^said^ Church must be victorious in the end and  I can foresee that the time is not far, when  she will come out conqueror over the Gentiles. I have the plan or scheme, to work here  in Europe, here on my Estate, quietly in the  interests of the Church of Jesus Christ of L. D. Saints,  and do that work with the power ^strength^ of all my  reasoning powers and spirit.

Should there be any letters at Salt Lake for me please remail them to me at the States I expect a large number by next mail from your city, as I have received none from home later than ten days after I left.  I have seen Cahin, he is well and I think his prospects are very good. Mr. Rollins went out when C. is with me. we parted at that place and soon after he was shot at by an Indian twice with a rifle one of the balls passing through his hat. My health has been very good since I left home, I have been highly favred for which I hope I feel truely thankful. I shall always feel a much greater interest to hear from Salt Lake now, since I have been there than formerly. hope your crops came in finely presume your large houses are progressing as rapidly as formerly, think that "Pic nic" will come off about the next time I am there. Please state in your next when the first emegration arrived and when they left Kanesville. what kind of a passage they had across the plains. hope Miller will get those goods through safe. he was to be with the first cumpany  Should Mr. Little ask for an extention on that bill it would not be convenient at present to grant it.
