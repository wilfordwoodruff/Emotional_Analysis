[FIGURE] I met with The Presidency and Twelve at PresidentYoungs Office at about 12 oclok. The subjet of the Endowments & 2nd Anointings was presented when President Young said that the order of the 2nd anointing was for the persons to be anointed to be cloathed in their Priestly robes the man upon the right hand and wife or wifes upon the left hand. The Administrator may be dressed in his usual clothing or in his Priestly Robes as he may see fit. The meeting should be opened by Prayer then the Administrator should Anoint the man A King & Priest unto the Most High God. Then he should Anoint his wife or wives Queens & Priestess unto her husband. There should be but one man anointed at any one meeting. If more than one man is anointed in a day, They should come together and open by Prayer as though their had not been any meeting before and thus continue to the End.Presidet Young said when a woman was Anointed a Queen to a good man and he died & the woman was sealed to another man for time it was not necessary for her to be anointed a Queen again but if she was Anointed a Queen to a man who was not worthy of a wife & she is sealed to another man she should be anointed a Queen unto him. When a good man dies & his wives have not been anointed Queens unto him they may be anointed Queens to him after his death without any Proxey.In speaking of the Endowments President Young said thatall persons who wished strickly to observedthe law ofthe Celestial Marriage should not get married untillthey get their Endowments & are sealed at the AltarThere may be instances whare persons are Aged & infirm 
 Dec 26 1866and not Able to get to the Endowment House if they have not had their Endowments may be sealed and in some insta-nces I have given this permission & others have takenthe advantage of it & urged to be sealed without comingto the Endowment House. I gave A Lyman the privilege ofsealing some in Sanbernadeno by his urgent request but itwill ^not^ avail any thing. Some may ask the question whymay we not seal & give Endowments abroad, because it would destroy the object of the gathering. The Peopleshould be gathered at head Quarters whare they canbe taught in the things of the kingdom of God & be underthe direction of the Priesthood. President Young said thatwhen Persons come to get their Endowments should be clean& pure A man should not touch a woman for 10 days beforegetting their Endowments and the Twelve while travellingshould hold meetings with the male members as priesthoodmeetings & teach these but they have to handled inwisdom or Evil will grow out of itIn speaking of the death of Joseph Smith the prophetPresident Young said it was necessary for Joseph Smith to shed his blood seal his Testimony withhis blood that his testimony might rest upon allNations that the wicked might be left without ecxcusein the day of Gods Judgments upon the wicked, if this had not been the case he would not have been slainin carthage jail. He sent away most of the Twelveand a web was woven which brought about this EventThe subject of A sermon Preached by A Lymanand published in the Millennium Star April 5, 1862,in vol 24 was brought up & red & it was found to havedone away with the Efficasy of the blood of Christ President B Young said he wished to know what the Twelve had to say about it For he had a go[o]d deal to say about itwhen you do away with the blood of the savior youdo away with all the Gospel & plan of Salvation. Ifthis doctrine as Preached by A Lyman & some by 
 Dec 26, 1866O Pratt be preached & Published as the doctrine ofthe Church & not contradicted by us it would notbe long before there would be syms [schysms] in the Church thisdoctrin as Preached in this sermon is fals doctrinif we do not believe that it wouldas necesary forChrist to shed his Blood to save the world, whare isour church it is nothing. This does not set wellupon my feelings. It is grievious to me to have theApostles teach fals doctrines. Now if the Twelve willsit down quietly & not contradict such doctrinesare they justified no they are notIn speaking of our Temporal Position President Young said if we could get up Female relief societies & they would use their influence to get the sisters to make their own bonnetts & make & wear their own Homemade clothing it would do much goodPresident Young said as A Philosipher I wish toask a question is there any Reflection or thought uponany thing that does not Exist I think there isAt the close of the meeting we made an Appointment to meetat the Endowment House at 12 oclokI met in the Evening with the Jordan dam companyin the council chamber, then went to President Youngsoffice & red the minutes of the dayDecember 27, 1866 ~ Thursday27.

I conversedwith Wilford upon the Principle of improvement of over-coming our passions & bringing them all in subjectinon toto the law of Christ. I wrote 3 letters to Phebe, Leslie, &[FIGURE] Susan ScholesJanuary 1, 1867 ~ TuesdayJan 1st I paid tithing for 1866, ($235^77^.86) still due $23. ($247.86)Thus the year 1866 has closed, past away, and goneand bourn its report to heaven of all men & Nations1860 & 66 have been two years which many men havelooked forward to as being periods of vast importanceto the world. 1860, commenced the dissolving ofthe American aUnion, the southern states seceded whichwas followed by a 4 years war which laid in the dusttwo millions of men, who were the strengs [strength] bone & sinnewof the Nation, and cost the Northern states alone Fourthousand Million dollars and left upon the world all theEvils which follow a Bloody civil war 
 1866, has been noted as a period of war beetweenthe President Andrew Johnson, and the Congress of the United States, and the increase of Dishonesty and corruption not ownly throughout the United States butthroughout the known world. It seems as though therenever was a more wicked & corrupt Generation thanthe one which we live. The whole Earth is ripened ininiquity and prepared for the damnation of Hell. Manyof both people & rulers of this Nation are seaking todestroy the Church and Kingdom of God from offthe Earth, and we are ownly preserved through thepower and Mercy of God. All Nations are preparingfor war, and are fearing and trembling for fear of those things which are coming upon the Earth. There is anawful uncertainty resting upon all Nations, but do not know what awaits them. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, the Zion of God, and the Kingdomof God are all progressing in the mountains of Israel, thewicked say let our Eye be upon Zion and let her be defi-led, but they know not the thoughts of the Lord neitherunderstand they his ways. But the Saints of God understandthey that are faithful are looking for the judgmentsof God to come upon the wicked, and for the coming ofthe Son of Man. There has been more sin, wickedness, and abominations, committed in the United States, andthroughout the Christian world during 1866 than infifty years a centeury ago. the whole Earth groans underthe sin and abominations which reigns upon the facethereof. The Lord is withdrawing his spirit from thewicked, and the devil rulses over them, and darknesscovors the Earth, and gross darkness the people. Wars andrumoorrs of wars are among all people, and great judgmentsawait the wicked; while the righteous saints will stand in Holy Places, and rejoice in the Lord their God, and theKingdom of our God will increase, and fill the whole Earthand stand forever, and He will Reign whose right it is to Reign

If we are Ever Exhalted andcrowned in the presence of God we shall become saviorsof a world which we shall create & People I know whythe Blood of Jesus was shed. I know why the blood ofJoseph, & Hiram & others have been shed and the bloodof others will be shed it is all to answer a purposeand has its Effect Adam made this world and suffered himself to take a body and subject himselfto sin that Redemption & Exaltation might come toman. without descending below all things we cannotasscend above all things. There never will be anychange of the gospel of salvation, it is an Eternalgospel and the same in all worlds and always willbe to the Endless ages of Eternity. There never wasa period but what worlds Exhisted & never will be, and they all have the same Gospel & Law of Salvation. Amasa Lyman is rejecting the Bloodof Christ has cut himself off from the Quorumof the Twelve Apostles and he cannot be restoredto it in this probation.

The Lord has gatheredus from the Nations through ^the gospel of^ of Christ He requires usto do all we can to gather the poor Saints from the Nationsof the Earth it is our duty to impart of our substance for that purpose 
 Oct 7th 18672nd The Education of our children. This is of vast importanceto our children the duty resting upon mothers is vary great, when does the Education of children begin. I will not tell you what ^you^ Believe about it or any one Els But Iwill tell you what I Believe about it & that is I Believe that the Education of the child Begins the day that the Spirit of Life from God Enters into the Tabernacle & asthe Mother is so will be the Child if the Mother is full offaith, prayer, & the spirit of God quiet & contented so will be her child if she is cross Fretful & discontentedit will Effect her child & after its Birth the Example set Before the child will Effect it through life, & the Education of the child or man will Never End untill thespirit leaves the Body & it will then continue to learn Forever& Forever. Mothers should teach there children to obey their Father & to obey carry out his orders in all thingsconcerning their Every day duties. If the Mother tells her child as soon as the Fathers Back is turned Now yourFather is gone you may go & pick those Apples & grapesor do any thing Els the Father has told them not to do theMother in such a course will make thieves of their children& ruin them The Mother should sustain the Father inthe government of the children, then they will all be Blessedtogether They should be taught to read the Bible Book of Mormon& doctrins & Covenats all good Books & let Novels alone3rd Ladies taught Business, This is right & proper &Ladies should be taught telegraphing & storekeeping & all such light work & let men do the Heavy work4th 500 teams wanted to dray rock. if the people valuethe Blessings of the Holy Priesthood as they should they willnever withhold the building of that temple5 The Missionaries called to go South our Brethren mayas well be in Dixie as in England as long as they are doingthe will of God6. The Young People are required to Marry & multiplyand replenish the Earth. This is the commandment of 
 Oct 7, 1867of God And I wish to say to the Young Ladies when theyoung Brethren make proposals of Marriage to them dont askthem how many carriages they have got or how much gold& silver, but ask are they virtueous, honest, industriousare they saints & willing to obey council if so marrythem & God will bless you. all the requirements in propertyI have herd was that they should have 3 straw beds all but the ticks. 7. Lay up your wheat I do not feel thata great deal is necessary to be said upon this subject. I think the visitation of the grass hoppers another year willcause us all to lay up wheat if we can get it without much preaching8. Learn to keep the law of Life. This is an important subjet I think we shall have to change our maner oflife in many things. But I feel that President Young isbetter qualified to teach this principle than I am9. & Last Elders teach what you know & not tell what would would have been if Christ had not died, & Adamfeel, & if the world had not been made &c. I have alwayshad more of the spirit of God in preaching the first princi-ples of the Gospel & testifying that Joseph was a prophet of God& the Book of Mormon true than in preaching many Misteries when a Man goes into misteries he is inthe swamp & does not know what he is doingG A Smith spoke 7 Minutes & dismissedOctober 8, 1867 ~ TuesdayOct 8.

 January 24, 1868 ~ FridayJan 24, 1868I spent the forenoon in the Legislature & Afternoon I attended the school of the Prophets Speeches were made By Brigham Young,H. C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, John Taylor, ^&^ Wilford Woodruff[FIGURE] W Woodruff I feel thankful for the privilege of speaking a few words to this school. I wish to refer to the first doctrin preached that Adam was our Father & God in the Revelation called the ollive leaf it says that "the Devil gathered together the Hostsof Hell And Michael the Arkangel gathered together the Hosts of Heaven and he overcame the devil & his Angels & this is the Battle of the Godreat God" who is this Michael the Ark Angelit is Adam who was Michael in the creation of the World.Again in regard to the redemption of the dead I believe it will take all the ordinances of the gospel of Christ to save soul as much as another. Jesus himself obeyed all the ordinancesof the Gospel that he might fulfill all righteousness. Thereforethose who have died without the gospel will have to receive the gospel in the spirit world from those who preach to the spirit in Prision, & those who dwell in the flesh will have to attend to all the ordinances of the gospel for & in their behalfby Proxy & it will take 1000 years with Jesus Christ at the headof all the Prophets & Apostles before the work will be finished inattending to all the ordinances for all the dead who have diedwithout the gospel. Again con[cer]ning Revelation I Believeit to be the privilege of Evry Apostle & Elder who bears any portion of the Holy Priesthood to have the Holy Ghost & Revelation to guide them in all things. But I do not Believethat the Lord will Reveal to any man a New Principle, doctrinor Law, to govern the Chu[r]ch & kingdom of God on the EarthExcept through the Mouth of the Prophet, Seer, RevelatorPresident & Law given unto the Church, this is his place& position to receive the word of the Lord & give it unto the people. There are some keys [FIGURE] which the Prophet Josephheld which No other man held while he lived. & there are some which President Brigham Young holds which No other Man holdsthe keys of the sealing power for instance But he permits otherApostles to administer in this ordinance 
 Jan 24, 1868Again their is another subject I wish to speak off. There isone subject upon my mind & has been for years that is contra-ry to my Practice & the Practice of this People & that is corncerningthe sabbath I have never thought that the Jews or ten Tribesof Israel would Ever keep the gentile Sabbath that is the first day of the week when I was Baptized into this Church I was keeping Saturday for the Sabbath. But I knew that the Later day saints were the tru Church of Christ & if I had imbibed 100 tradition I would have given them up for this I dont know as the Latter Day Saints will Ever keepthis day & it does not make any difference whether they door not for the Lord will dictate them Just as he please inall those things. But when Moses received this comm-andment to keep the seventh day of the week The Lord [said] this Law shall remain as a statute Betwen me & the Houseof Israel forever throughout all your Generation I have Never found this commandment changed By anyrevelation from God. [##Exodus 20:8-11##] Jesus & the Apostles kept the 7 day ofthe week called the Jewish Sabbath. Yet the Apostlesdid meet in some Instances on the first day of the weekto Break bread &c. Constantine changed the day of worship from the seventh to the first day of the week about 600 years after Christ, we received a Revelationin the doctrins & covents in the Early age of this Chirchto Meet upon the Lords day to Break Bred &c. But the Lorddid not reveal which day of our time was the Exact diythat the Lord Commanded Israel to keep. At the close ofthe remarks. President Young read the revelation and said that there had been so much change in time thatwe do not know the Exact time that was the seventh dayPresident Young made many remarks upon various subjectsJanuary 25, 1868 ~ Saturday25 [FIGURES] I spent the fore part of the day in the Endowment Housewe gave Endowments to 46.

 Aug 22nd 1868and inspired of God to Preach the gospel of Christ & could tell me the true way to be saved now as we travel through the coun-try we meet thousands of children as well as men & women whocan see Prophets Apostles & Elders by merly walking a few rodsinto the streets to greet President Young, the Twelve & others aswe travel through the country it is a good thing for these chil-dren to come out in procession to Greet the President as he com-es along through through the country for it will make a good impression upon there minds one that they will never forgetwhen these Boys & girls meet to gether thirty years hence in 1898 & convers to gether upon the scenes of this visitwhat will be their conversation it will be sumthing like the following O what a great change has taken placesince the Prophet Brigham Young & the Apostles visited us inLogan in 1868 Then it was a New Country with butfew inhabitants not more than ten thousand People in all Cash Valley, then we had No Tabernacle or Temple in this valleyNow we have a great Tabernacle & a great Temple builton the high Bench of Logan & we can be drawn on the topof its Towers by machinery whare we can view the gloryof this valley filled with cities & magnificet Palaces &Towers occupied by one Million of the Saints of God whocan come up to the Temple on Logan Bench & get their Endowments & Blessings in their turn. Then our fieldsof grain & garden were half sunflowers & weed sincethen by the commandment of God no man occupies moreland then he can keep clean of weeds & beautify, thenwe had no shade trees in our streets, now our streetsar adorned with the mulbury tree from which we makeour silk which now adorns our Bodies & the Bodies of our children then the Apostle E T Benson & Bishop MaughnPresided over us, since then they have gone withPresident Young to& others to Jackson Co Mo to Build thegreat Temple & the New Jerrusalem This visit was in1868 then we were children now it is 1898 & great changes have taken place since that day throughout 
 Aug 22nd 1868Great Babylon as well as in Mount Zion that year wasthe great Election for the Presidency of the United States Grant & Colfax were the Candidates for the Black Repullin & Seymour & Blair for the Dimocratts, then the Nation felt strong & Powerful since then it has been broken to peacesThat visit was before the destruction of the City of New York By the Sea Heaving itself beyong its bounds & washing the inhabitants into the Sea & they were drowned. It was Before Albany was utterly Destroyed by fire It was beforeBoston was sunk with an Earthquake. It was beforeChicago was struck with lightning & burned with fire & Brimstone for their Abominations. It was before the many Millions of the UniPeople of the United States & other Nations of the Earth were destroyed bywith their Cities By the Great Judgments of God Because of their great sins & wickedness in the sight of Heaven & Earth, this was Before theUnited States became so weakened & Broaken to peaces thatthey called upon Brigham Young to take the Presidency of the United States to save the Constitution & the remnant of the Nation from utter destruction. If this will not be the conversation of those little children 30 ho who were in the procession with their Banners to welcome the prophet& Apostles on their Enterance into this City, thirty years from this it will be sumthing like it.

Kimballs RemarksHe said Vilate & I have lived together 46 years and I have left 
 The Funeral of Vilate M Kimball Oct 24 1867Her many times to go & preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I bidher good By as much then as I have now. I did this in Zions Campalso when I went to England & at different times. She has beentrue to me always and never left Nor forsook me. I have taken40 wives & many without her knowledge but she afterwards gavethem to me in the Temple. She has passed through many trialsbut she has been always true to me. When Vilate was first takensick the spirits took the advantage of her. When I went to lay hands upon her I saw a Devil in the room meeting me & I sawit several times. I felt indignant by the spirit of God, there is many fals spirits that are trying to destroy our children, andwill destroy all they can. We should strive to overcome themshe sympathized with me untill her last Breath. Br Brigham &I have stood By Joseph unto the End, & he will never forsakeor forget us No never. No more than God will forget his ownlyBegotten Son. The foregoing is ownly a synopsis of his remarksFarewell all Earthly honors was then sung & J Taylor DismissedThe Following is a synopsis of remarks of President Brigham Youngat the commencement of the Funeral of Vilate Kimball He was the firstspeaker. He said when I buried my first wife I do not thinkthere was a tear shed, and it is a great victory gained to overcomethe death & the grave & have a glorious resurrection The good oftensuffer as well as the wicked we suffer in the Flesh but when we die & the spirit leaves the Body The Devil & Evil has No morepower over us When the spirits of the righteous Enter the spirit worldthey are Beyond the power of the Devil. The knowledge, which theLatter Day Saints have obtained have put us in possession of powerwhich the world has not. We live not for this world alone butfor the resurrection. There is^are^ man^y^ in this room who have donethe Best they could They would not wish to try it over againwhere does Vilate go when this Body is laid off She is in thepresence of God not whare his Tabernacle is but have his presencein spirit & we can see all things that we wish or desire to seewe are as much in the presence of God in this City as though wewere with him in person I do not know whether Vilate iswith us in this room or not but we have good spirits with us 
 The Funeral of Vilate Kimball Oct 24 1867and we feel themir influence. We also have all the devils thatfall from Heaven & wicked men to contend with but whare,those spirits have power on a person they Effect the bodybut does it take any Glory from Vilate because of her afflictionNo not in the least she will have a greater reward. She hasnot Been afflicted because of sins, But Because the devilhas power on her body & some in this City who cherish Evilspirits & devils they try to destroy the ignorant Vilate willcome forth with her body & will stand at the Head of this Family & Heber at her head as he has here & this will bethe case with all who are good. Now we should prepareourselves to go as well as Vilate has. let us be faithful till we hear the Trump sound. I Expect Joseph Smithwill be the first man resurrected then He will resurrecthis family Just when he pleases & if we live so as to comeforth in the first Resurrection we shall rejoice to all EternityPresident Joseph Young spoke a few moments It was a solemtime At the close of the funeral the Body was removed to the Family Grave of Brother Kimball[One Line Blank]October 26, 1868 ~ MondayOct 26, 1868 To day was quite a serious day I was quite[FIGURE] Feble in health and about noon my Indian BoySarokeets came up from the field & had quit his work &had left the Cane Mill with No one to Feed it & theywere Boiling Molasses & had not help Enough so they setmy little son Asahel ownly 5 years old to feed the millso while feeding he got his right hand caught in the rollersHe hallowed & the Mule instantly stoped & the Mill rolled back but still it smashed about one half of his hand hisMother Emma & Wilford took him into the waggon & came to the City as soon as they could, they came to Dr Olmsby, & whileI was talking to Keets Wilford drove up & informed me of the accidentthat had happened to Asahel I immediately went to thedocters & there found the Boy with his hand in a dredfulcondition we gave him cloraform & it took about one hourto dress his hand it took off his Thumb & two fingers But

 History of Wilford Woodruff concludedheading for printersChapter of Accidentswritten G. S. L. City February, 1858Varied and diverse are the lives and fortunesof men, while the paths of some are strewen with flowers and ease from the cradle to the gravewith naught to disturbe their peace, others apparently are marked victims of variated misfortunes, accidents, and dangers; the last named class is the one, in whose ranks I have stoood stood, thro'my infancy, childhood, youth & manhood, up to the present time, so ^much so,^ that it has seemed as though some invisaible power or fate was watching my ^foot^steps, in order to find some opportunity to take my life from the earth; I can only attribute the continuation of my life on Earth to the present time, to a merciful God, whose hand has been stretched out and rescued me from death in the midst of many ^of the^ many dangers and hair breadth escapes, I have passed through, some of which I will here mention. When 3 years of age I fell into a caldron of boiling water, was instantly caught out, but was so badly scalded, that it was nine months fbefore I was considered out of danger. When at 5 years of age, I fell from the great beam of a barn rafters ^striking^ my bare face upon the floor, which came near breaking my neck. Three months afterwards, I broke one of my arms, by falling down a pair of stairs; I soon after broke my other arm by falling out of a high stoop, upon a pile of timber. When six years of age, I came near being killed by a surly Bull. ^see people apart^ and was only savedby as it were by a miracle, ^¶^ dDurring the same year, I went into my fathers saw mill, with several others. I got upon the headblock to take a ride while the carriage was running back, not anticipating any danger, but before I was aware, my leg was caught 
 between the headblock and the fender post, and broke both bones of my leg below the knee. I was taken to the house and lay nine hours before my bones were set, which time was spent amidst ^suffering severe pain, but being young my bones soon knitt together and in a few days, I was again upon my feet; during my confinement, by this lameness, my bro., Thompson, was my companion in the same room going through with a course of the typhus fever. When 7 years of age, I was riding on the top of a load of hay, which my uncle,Ozen Woodruff, was driving to the barn, he turned the load over upon me. I was nearly strangled for the want of air, before the hay was removed. ^¶^At 8 years of age ^old^ I was riding in a one horse wagon with several others, the horse took fright ran down a steep hill and turned the wagon over upon us; but again while in the midst of danger my life was pre-served; none of us were seriously injured. When 9 years ^old^ I climbed into an elm tree to obtain bark. I stepped upon a dry limb, which broke and I fell about 15 feet upon my back which beat the breath out of my body, a cousin ran and told my parents I was dead; before they arrived at the spot, I came to my senses and met my parents ^them^ coming to me. When 12 years of age I was drownd in Farmington Rriver, and sunk in 30 ft of water, and after carrying one person to the bottom with me, I was miraculously saved by a young man named Bacon by diving to the bottom, and carrying with him a large stone, to holld hold him down until he obtained my body, not expecting to save my life ^me alive^: I suffered much in being restored to life: ^at 13 years of age^ While passing through Farmington meadows, in the depth of winter, the roads were drifted with snow, and in an exceedingly blustering day I became so chilled and 
 overcome with cold, ^so that^ I could not travel. I crawled into the hollow of a large apple tree a man in the distance seeing me go into ^it^ the tree hastened to my rescue, realizing my danger more fully than I didwhen he arrived at the spot I had fallen asleep and was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty in arousing me to a sense of my situation, he procured means to carry me to my father's house, and through a kind providence my life was again preserved. At 14 years of age, I split my left instep open with an ax which went nearly through my foot; and it was 9 months getting well. At 15 year of age, I was bitten in my left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of hydrophobia; he only dented my hand with his teeth but did not draw blood & I was again preserved through the mercies of God from an awful death. At the age of 17, I metwith an accident which caused me much sufferingand came near ending my life, I was riding a very ill tempered horse, which I was not acquainted with, and while going down a very steep ^rocky^ hill, the horse took the ^taking^ advantage of the ground, suddenly leaped from the ground ^road^, and ran down the steepest part of it ^the hill^, amid the roughest of the rocks at full speed, and commenced kicking up at the same time, and attempted to throw me over his head upon the rocks, but I lodged upon the top of his head grasped hold of each ear, as with a death grasp, expecting every moment to be dashed to pieces among ^against^ the rocks, while in this position sitting astride of his neck with no bridle to guide him but his ears, he plunged down the hill under full speed until he ran against a rock, which ^and^dashed him to the ground. I went over both his head on and the rock, about one rod, and struck the ground square on my feet, being the only thing visible that 
 saved my life, for had I struck upon any other part of my body, it must have killed me instantly, as it was my bones crushed from under me as though they were reeds, it broke my left leg twice in two places and put out both my ankles in a shocking mannerand the Horse came near rolling over me in his struggles to get up; my uncle, Titus Woodruff, saw me fall got assistance me and carried me to his houseI lay from 2 O'clock ^pm^ till 10 at night without medical aid then my Father arrived bringing Dr Swift of Farmington with him who set my bones boxed up my limbs and carried me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my fathers;my sufferings were very great yet I had good attention and in 8 weeks I was out doors upon my crutches. In 1827 while attempting to clear the ice out of a water wheel; standing upon the wheel with one arm around the shaft; a man hoisted the gate and let a full head of water upon it, as soon as the water struck the wheel it ^the wheel^ it started, my feet slipped into the wheel I immediately plunged head long foremost over the rim of the wheel into about 3 feet of water and my weight drew my legs out of the wheel, or I should have been drawn under a shaft and crushed to death. In 1831 while having charge of the flouring mill in Collinsville Ct. I was standing inside of a breast wheel 20 ft. in diameter, upon one of the arms near the top, clearing out the ice, when a full head of water was let on to it, it immediately started; but I droped my ax and leaped through the wheel to the bottom of it, by the shaft and arms about 20 feet: as I struck the bottom of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone wall with only about 2 feet of water clearance between it and the wheel, the wheel caught me and rolled me out into the water below where I found myself with-out any bones broken, but with some bruses and much fright. 
 During the winter of 1831, while in New hartford, Ct. I passed through a severe fit of sickness course of lung fever. In 1833, the day I was baptized into the churchof Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints; one of my horses, newly caught ^sharp shod^, kicked my hat off my head and had he struck 2 inches lower, would probably have killed me instantly, in 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same team down a hill on a sleigh without any box the bottom boards slipped forward under the roller and caught the ground, turned end ways and fell on the horses' backs, ^throwing me between^ between the horses, they ran to the bottom of the hill dragging me by ^with^ the lines, head foremost with the sleigh on top of me about 20 rods over a smooth snow path, I escaped unharmed however, in the midst of both dangers. In 1834 while traveling in Zion's camp in Mo. a rifle was accidentally discharged and the ball passed through 3 tents with about 12 men in each, and lodged in a wagon axletree while a man was standing behind it, it ^and^ injured no one ^it^ passed within a few inches of my breast, and many others escaped as narrowly as myself: a few months afterwards a musket heavily loaded with buckshot was accidentlally snapped with the muzzle pointed at my breast within a fewfew feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot, it had a good flint and ^was^ well primed, but it missed fire and my life was a gain preserved. In April 1839 in Rochester Ills. I was riding upon the running gears of a wagon without a box, I was sitting upon the forward axletree, the bolt came out, fastening the copuling pole, which left the hind wheels, and my weight on the forward bolster and tongueturned the copuling pole, clear over onto the horses backs, turned the stakes upside down 
 and shut me up fast, ^between the bolster and tongue^ but in such a manner that my head and shoulders dragged on the ground my horses took fright and ran out into an open prairie and thus dragged me in this possession ^position^ for about half a mile. I managed to guide them with my left hand, so as to run them into a corner ^of a high worm^of the fence, where we landed in a pile together. I was considerably bruised but escaped without any broken bones. On the 23rd July 1842 Prest Joseph Smith sent me to S from Nauvoo to St. Louis to procure a stock of paper. I went down upon a steamboat was 6 days on the way, during which time I was severely attacked with billious fever. The day I made my purchase, the fever was so high I was scarcely sensible of what I was doing, as soon as I made my purchase, and got my freight on board, I took my birth and lay there until I arrived at Nauvoo, whichwas on the 10 of Aug.st. I was confined to my bed 40 days and passed through the most severe fit of sickness I ever endured, my life was dispaired of by many of my friends; I was administered to by Prst Smith and the Twelve: my life was preserved by the power of God. I took a relapse twice after I began to recover, once while in council with the Presidency & Twelve, my strengths left me my breath stoped and I felt as though I was struck with death. On the 12th Sept 12, 1843 I left At 5 o'clock p.m. I left Boston, on the express train for Portlandwhile passing through Chester woods 6 miles south [of] Kennebunk some person having pried up ^raised^ the ^one of the^ railsand put under them ^rolled^  a log, ^under it^ and it being darkthe we struck it at full speed and landed ina pile of ruins. 3 cars were filled with passengers 
 and their lives were saved, by having a long train of freight between the passenger cars and the engine, which ^all of them^ were mashed to pieces, the engineer was killed, some of the passengers had bones broken I escaped unhurt. On the 5th day of Oct 1846, while with the Camp of Israel building up winter quarters on the west side of the Missouri river, (then Indian country,) I passed through one of the most painful and serious misfortunes I ever of any of my life I took my axe and went two and a half miles on to the bluffs, to cut some shingle timber to cover my shanty cabin I was accompanied by two other men and while falling the 3rd trees ^was falling^ which was an oak over 2 ft diameter I stepped behind it some 10 feet, and also to one side the same distance, where I thought I was entirely out of danger, but when the tree fell there being a crook in the body of it, ^which^ struck a knoll on the ground when the whole body shot endways back of the stump and bounded, and the butt of the tree struck me on the breast, and knocked me several feet into the air, ^against a standing oak^ and the falling tree followed me in its bound and caught me against the standing tree and I came down between the them, before reaching the ground I was liberated from them and struck the ground upon my feet, badly bru^i^sed my left thigh the whole length of it and my hip also ^and^ my left arm, it also broke my breast bone also 3 ribs on my left side also bruised my lungs, vitals and left side were also bruised in a shocking manner. after the accident I sat upon a log until MrMo Garrison went a quarter of a mile to get my horse; notwithstanding I was so badly hurt I had 
 Nauvoo August 1st 1840had to mount^ed^ my horse and ride ^rode^ 2 1/2 miles, over avery rough road and had to dismount^ed^ twicein consequence of miry places, my breast andvitals were so badly torn to pieces that at each step ofthe horse the pain went through me ^like an^ arrow; I continuedon horse back until I arrived at Turkey Creekon the north side of Winter Quarters I then becameexhausted and was taken off my horse andcarried to my wagon in a chair; I was met inthe street by Prests Brigham Young, H. C. Kimball& W. Richards and others who assisted in carryingme to ^my^ family; before laying me upon my bed, thePresidency laid hands upon me rebuked mysuffering and distress in the name of theLord, and said I should live and not die, I was then laid upon my bed in my wagonand as the Apostles prophesied upon my headso it came to pass. I did live and not die. I employed no physician on this occasion butwas administered to by the Elders of Israeland nursed by my Wife. I lay upon my bedunable to move, until my breast bone beganto knit together, which commenced on the 9thday, I began to walk about in 20 days in30 days from the time I was hurt, I againcommenced to do hard labor.On the 21st day of April 1856, I innoculatedmy arms with poison and mortification ^ensued^; whileassisting to remove an ox that had died frompoison and had been skinned; the poison workedthrough my system for seven days before itshowed itself outwardly. on the 28 my arm began to swell, was in great pain and showed signs 
 of mortification I showed it to Prest. Young who advisedme to cleanse my stomach immediately and puton onion poultices and any thing that would drawthe poison from my system into my arm, whichI counsel I immediately put into execution. the29th was another trying day to my life, the poisonhad so thoroughly penetrated my whole system thatmy strength left me I could not stand, I was ledto my bed, my bowels and stomach ceased toact, my speech was like that of a drunken manPrest. Young called into company with Dr Spragueand laid hands upon me and rebuked the diseaseand the power of the distroyer which had sceizedmy body and promised me in the name of theLord, that I should not die but live to finishedmy work which was appointed me, upon theEarth. I soon began to recover; the poison andmortification left my body system and centeredin my arm, and was drawn from my armthrough the aid of charcoal poultices, moistenedwith a strong decoction of wormwood rag weedand wild sage; the dead flesh was removedfrom my arm with instruments and lunar causticand in a few days I was well again.I have occupied considerable space in referingto those peculiar circumstances, which have attendedme during life, and to sum the matter up, it standsthus: I have broken both legs, one twice in two ^in two places^, botharms, both ankles, ^dislocated^ my breast bone and three ribs, ^and ^had^ both ankles dislocated^I have been drown^e^d, froze, scalded, and bit bya mad dog; have been in two water wheels underfull head of water; have passed through severalsevere fits of sickness; & encountered poison in itsworst forms; have landed in a pile of rail-road ruins 
 have barely been missed a ^the^ passing bullet, andhave passed through a score of other hair-breadthescapes. It has appeared miraculous to me, thatwith all the injuries and broken bones, whichI have met with ^had^; I have not a lame limb aboutme, but have been enabled to endure the hardestlabor, exposures and journeys, have oftenwalked 40, 50, and on one occasion 60 miles in aday. The protection and mercy of God has beenover me and my life thus far has been preservedfor which blessings I feel to render the gratitudeof my heart to my Heavenly Father; prayingthat the remainder of my days may bespent in his service and in the building upof his Kingdom. 
 August 1832 a continuance of the foreerding subjectI have hastily noticed in the foregoing pages some of the leading circumstancesof my life, up to the time of my entering the ranks of the Servants of God. In looking it over I find many imperfections but as it was writtensome time since and in great haste I shall let it remain for thepresent and continue my narrative begginning where Ileft off When I entered the ranks of Gods people and first commencedthe Christians warfare I had but faint ideas of the narrownessof that Way, and but little realized that it was as strait away as the scriptures represent it to be, that but few shouldfind & walk in it. Much less did I in my weakness conceivethe many artful & cunning devices of Satan to draw thechild of God from the paths of holiness I had not yet learntby experience that the Devil like a roaring Lion goeth aboutseeking whom he may devour and that he grasps with hisdeadly claws every one that turns aside from the Highwayof Holiness. But as I turned and set my face Zion ward andbegan to take up my march thither I soon began to hearthe — at first but whispered suggestions of the Adversary trying towin me back to his service and I soon began to feel his fireydarts levelled and hurled at me from almost every quarterI soon found that I had enlisted as a Soldier in a warfareand that I must act not only the offensive but likewisethe defensive part and if I would gain the prize I mustfight. But I had yet (as a raw undiciplined recruit) to learn theuse of the armour with which Christians fight their battlesand from whom I could expect help from troubleI could not wield with ease the Sword of the Spirit and theShield of Faith though a comfortable garment ^& armour^, did not fitmy body Shapen and conceive in Sin, in fine the garmentsof Salvation could not be expected to fit perfectly, and setwith ease on one who had so long been clothed with shameand clad with the filthy garments of UnrighteousnessBut I had yet to learn of My Captain, of Him who is meekand lowly some simple & humble lessons of Christianitybefore I could make much resistance with the enemyin case of an open attack. Encouraging thought thatthe Captain of our Salvation being in all points temptedas we are is able to succour those that are temptedand that he will with every temptation providea way for our escape 
 (Continued from page 168.)HISTORY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-At an early age my mind was exer-cised upon religious subjects, althoughI never made a profession until 1830. I did not then join any church, forthe reason that I could not find any denomination whose doctrines, faithor practice, agreed with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or the ordinances and gifts which the Apostles taught. Although the ministers of the day taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles and ordinances, which the ancient Saints enjoyed, were doneaway and no longer needed, I did not believe it to be true, only as they were done away through the unbelief of the children of men. I believed the same gifts, graces, miracles and power would be manifest in one age of the world as in another, when God had a Church upon the earth, and that the Church of God would be re-establishedupon the earth, and that I should liveto see it. These principles were rivet-ed upon my mind from the perusal of the Old and New Testament, with fervent prayer that the Lord wouldshow me what was right and wrong, and lead me in the path of salvation,without any regard to the opinions ofman; and the whisperings of the Spiritof the Lord for the space of three years, taught me that he was about to set up his Church and kingdom upon the earth in the last days. I wastaught these things from my youth by Robert Mason, an aged man, who lived in Simsbury, Conn., who wasfrequently called the old prophet Mason. He taught me many things which are now coming to pass. He did not believe that any man had authority to administer in the ordi-nances of the Gospel, but believed itwas our privilege, through faith, prayer and fasting, to heal the sick and cast out devils by the laying on of hands, which was the case under his admini-stration, as many could testify.In 1832, I was inspired to go to Rhode Island; my brother, Asahel,was also directed by the Spirit of Godto go to the same place. When wemet, we both told our impressions,and it caused us to marvel and wonderwhat the Lord wanted of us in RhodeIsland; but, as we had made prepara-tions to move to the west, we let out-ward circumstances control us, and,Jonah like, instead of going to RhodeIsland, we went to Richland, Oswego county, New York, and there remained until Dec. 29, 1833, when I heard El-ders Zerah Pulsipher and Elijah  Cheeny preach. My brother Azmonand I believed their testimony, enter-tained the Elders, and offered our-selves for baptism the first sermon weheard. We read the Book of Mor-mon, and I received a testimony thatit was true.We soon learned what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island, for atthe time we were warned to go there, two of the Elders were preaching there, and had we gone, we should have em-braced the Work at that time.Dec. 31—I was baptized by Elder Zerah Pulsipher; he confirmed me the same evening.Jan. 2, 1834—I was ordained a Teacher, and my brother Azmon an 
 Elder, and a small Branch organizedof twelve members, by Elder Pulsi-pher.In February following, in company with Elder Holton, I walked somesixty miles to the town of Fabius, to attend an evening meeting of the Saints in that place, where Elder Pul-sipher was presiding. I saw the book of commandments or revelations given through Joseph Smith, and I believed them with all my heart, and rejoiced therein; and after spending severaldays, and holding several meetings, we returned home rejoicing.During the winter, we were visited by several of the Elders. Feb. 1st.,Elder Parley P. Pratt called upon us and instructed the Branch till mid-night; we had a precious time. I accompanied brother Pratt to Jeffer-son county, and told him my circum-stances; he said it was my duty to prepare myself to go to Kirtland, and join the Camp of Zion. I immedi-ately settled my business.April 11, 1834—With my horses and wagon, I took brothers Harry Brown and Warren Ingles, and started for Zion. I met with Orson Pratt,John Murdoch and other Elders, on the way, and arrived in Kirtland on the 25th day of April, 1834.The Prophet Joseph invited me tomake his house my home; I accepted his offer, and staid with him about one week. I became acquainted with many of the High Priests, Elders andSaints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirt-land, and heard many of the Eldersspeak, and I felt to rejoice before God for the light and knowledge which was manifested to me during that day.May 1—I started from Kirtland,and went to New Portage and re-mained till all the company joined us, when we were organized.March [May] 7—We took up our line of march, pitched our tents by the way, and travelled to Missouri.After we had pitched our tents in Clay county, (our numbers being 205) and many of the brethren had taken sick, and some had died, Joseph re-quested the camp to disperse, except enough to take care of the sick. Allwho had teams were required to leave the ground and go among the bre-thren. I went to brother LymanWight's, in company with Heman Hyde and Milton Holmes. Shortly, Joseph called the brethren together at Lyman Wight's, and told them if theywould humble themselves before theLord, and covenant to keep His com-mandments and obey His counsel, the plague should be stayed from thathour, and there should not be another case of cholera in the Camp. The brethren covenanted to do this, and the plague was stayed, and there was not another case in Camp.President Joseph Smith returned toKirtland with many of the brethren;I remained with Lyman Wight, labor-ing with my hands till the following winter.I had a great desire to preach the Gospel, which I did not name to my brethren; but one Sunday evening I retired into the woods alone, and called upon the Lord in earnest prayer, to open my way to go and preach the Gospel to the inhabitants of the earth. The Spirit of the Lord bore witness that my prayer was heard, and should be answered. I arose from my kneeshappy, and walked some forty rods, and met Elias Higbee, a High Priest,with whom I had staid a number of months. As I approached him, he said, "Brother Wilford, the Spirit ofthe Lord tells me that you should be ordained, and go on a mission." I re-plied, "I am ready."At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wight's, Clay county, Mis-souri, Nov. 5th, I was ordained a Priest by Elder Simeon Carter; Ste-phen Winchester and Heman T. Hyde were also ordained Priests.Bishop Partridge said he would like to have me go into the Southern States, through Arkansas, Tennessee and Ken-tucky; and if I could find any body who had faith enough to go with me—for it would be a dangerous countryto travel in, in consequence of the Missouri persecutions—to take him.I told him I was as ready to go south as anywhere, and asked if I should gothrough Jackson county, as it lay inour route. He replied, it would be at the risk of life, and he had not faith enough to undertake it; if I had, I might try it. I also asked him, if I went through Jackson county, if Ishould start without purse or scrip, 
 according to the law of God. He answered, that he had not faith enoughto start on a mission through Jackson county without money, and if I did it, I must do it on my own faith. I felt strenuous to keep the commandments, so I started without money. I called upon Elder Harry Brown, and askedhim to accompany me; he consented, and Bishop Partridge appointed him to go with me.Jan. 13, 1835—I received an honor-able discharge from Lyman Wight,certifying that I had faithfully per-formed my duties in Zion's Camp.I took my valise in hand, weighing15 lbs., mostly Books of Mormon, and started in company with Elder HarryBrown, crossed the river into Jackson county, and felt thankful. We bowedour knees, and prayed that God might protect us from the mob while going through the country, and that his judgments might rest upon the wickedwho had shed the blood of the Saintsin that land, that the land might be cleansed from sin. I had a petition to the Governor of Missouri, for re-dress of wrongs perpetrated upon us in Jackson county, for the purpose of obtaining signatures. We bent our way south, through Jackson county, without any molestation; yet, in oneinstance, we were preserved from a mob of about sixty, assembled at a grog-shop which we had to pass.(To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 184.)HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-June [January] 18—We called at the Har-mony mission, and had an interview with the President, a Presbyterianminister. Although it was near sun-down, he would neither give us any-thing to eat, nor lodge us, because we were "Mormons." It was fifteenmiles to the nearest house, which was Jerrew's Indian trading house. We asked the minister to direct us there.He gave us directions, but the Spirit said to me he was deceiving us. I asked him three times, and he declared he was telling us the truth. We followed his directions, and we cameto the Osage river swamp, where we were lost in the darkness of the night. We followed the river, but as it is very crooked, we made but little pro-gress. After travelling through mud and water for one hour, we concludedto go out on the open prairie, and lie down in the grass until morning; but when we got out into the prairie, weheard the Osage Indians' drum andshout at the trading house, as they 
 were having a pow-wow. As we ap-proached, we were met by a dozen large savage looking dogs; they smeltus in a friendly manner, but did not attempt to bite nor bark. We ar-rived about midnight, covered with mud, hungry and weary, and werekindly received and entertained for the remainder of the night by Mr. Jerrew, who had an Osage squaw for a wife; she prepared us a good supper,but marvelled that we did not drink coffee. She proffered us their bestbed, which was highly ornamented, but we declined her kind offer, as wewere wet and muddy. She made us agood bed of mackinaw blankets, beforea large fire, and we slept comfortably. May the Lord reward both Mr. Jerrew and wife, and the Presbyterian mini-ster, according their deserts.To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 200.)HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-June [January] 19—Mr. Jerrew gave us a good breakfast, put us across the Osage river in a canoe, and we started upon our long day's walk, it being sixty miles to the nearest house. We hadnot anything with us to eat. Most of our travels through the day wasthrough prairie; before dark we en-tered timbered land; as we approached the timber, a large black bear met us; we had no weapons. When the bear gotwithin about six rods of us, he rose uponhis hind feet, and examined us a short time, and went off. We were soonenveloped in such thick darkness, that it was with great difficulty we could keep the road, and surrounded by alarge drove of wolves, which kept up a continual howling, and would fre-quently rush to within a few feet of us. We travelled about two hours in this situation, feeling that we were in danger, and concluded to stop and build a fire, and wait till morning.Accordingly, we built a large fire,which drove the wolves off; and as we were about to lie down, we hearda dog bark, and a bell. We felt assured we were near a house; both of us took a brand of fire, and on going about one quarter of a mile, we came to a log hut, which was occupied by Mr. Williams, who had been in Jack-son county during the mobbing of the 
 Saints, and had lately moved here, depending upon his gun mostly for his living. It was sixty miles to ahouse on the north, and twelve mileson the south. He and his family were living in a small old log hut, about twelve feet square, and one bed in theroom, upon which lay his wife, severalchildren and three young dogs. He lay stretched out upon the bare floor, with his feet to a small fire. There was no door to the house, but a rag-ged quilt hung up in the door way; it was past eleven o'clock at night. I turned away the quilt, looked into thehouse, and spoke three times; no onestirred, not even a dog. I walked in, and laid my hands upon the man's shoulder, and spoke to him. The mo-ment he felt the weight of my hand, he leaped to his feet, and commenced running around the room, leaping as high as he could each jump. I told him not to be frightened, as we were travellers and friends, and did notwish to hurt him, but wished to stop with him over night. When he came to his senses, he gave us permission to stop with him till morning, if we would take the bare floor, as he did. We asked for something to eat, as we had walked sixty miles without amorsel of food. He replied, he had nothing for us, and assured us he had to kill game for his breakfast in themorning. He informed us that thereason of his fright, was in conse-quence of his having shot a large pan-ther, a few nights previous, standingin his door, and he thought his mate had lit upon him. We lay down upon the floor, and we were glad of thisplace, as it soon began to rain, and rained through the night.In the morning we arose, and went on in the rain twelve miles, to a Mr. Conner's, who was also in the Jacksoncounty mob. He gave us breakfast, but damned us while we were eating, because we were "Mormons." Whenwe had finished a hearty breakfast,we thanked him very politely, andwent on our way, leaving him swear-ing. We felt thankful for breakfast, for we had walked seventy-two miles without eating food. We taught from house to house as we journeyed.Jan. 24—I preached at Mr. NathanTanner's, in Green county, Missouri, the first time we had found a congre-gation we could preach to in safety,and the first time that I had ever attempted to preach as a missionary. I had great liberty, and was followedby Elder Brown. During our preach-ing, there was a snow storm.We arrived at Petty John Creek, in Arkansas, where Mr. Alexander Ake-man resided, with a large family of sons and one daughter, settled around him. Mr. Akeman, and a part of the family, were members of the Churchin Jackson county; his wife diedstrong in the faith in Missouri. Hiswhole family were mobbed, and someof his sons were whipped severely;but he could not stand the persecution and the loss of his property. Hemoved to Arkansas, to get rid of "Mormonism," had apostatized, and was bitter against the Work. Whenwe called upon him, he opposed us strongly—spoke against the leaders of the Church and the Book of Mormon. He had one son who received us, and had a little faith. I dreamed the night before, that we were required towalk in a straight, narrow path; and while following the path, it led to thedoor of a house, which was placed ina high wall that we could not getaround. As I opened the door to go through, I saw the room was filled with large serpents. I entered, and they all coiled up to jump at me; as they made a spring to bite me, theyall fell dead at my feet, turned black, swelled up, burst open, took fire, and were consumed before my eyes.We met with much opposition from Mr. Akeman, and many in the neigh-borhood. Elder Brown wished to leave the place immediately. I told him I should stay, and see my dreamfulfilled. We staid in the neighbor-hood twenty-five days, during whichtime the Lord brought judgment uponthose who threatened to mob and kill us; many of them died suddenly, andI was warned three times by the Lord, to go to Mr. Akeman, and bear testi-mony unto him of the truth of "Mor-monism," and the wickedness of his course in opposing it; and the last time I called upon him, he was filled with wrath against me, and when I left his house, he followed me in arage, apparently with some evil intent. 
 When I had got a few rods from his door, he was nearly treading on myheels, and fell dead at my feet, asthough he had been struck with light-ning; he swelled, and immediately turned black. This created a greatwailing and mourning among his family. Brother Brown and myself assisted in laying him out and buryinghim. He died Feb. 14, 1835.This singular dispensation of Provi-dence brought solemnity upon the people, and they began to reflect and wished to hear preaching. We heldseveral meetings and preached, andbaptized Mr. Hubbel and his wife, who had opened their doors and given us a home; and just as we had got the people prepared to receive theGospel and anxious to learn, and plead-ing with us to stay and preach, bro-Brown resolved that he would con-tinue his journey south. I was fully satisfied that should we stop, we would built up a Church, and wasconvinced it was our duty to stop; but brother Brown held the office ofan Elder, and I submitted.Brother Brown did not baptize ano-ther person on the mission.(To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 217.)HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-March 2—We cut down a large cotton-wood tree, and in two daysdug out a canoe four feet wide and twelve long, put on a pair of oars, and then rowed down the Arkansasriver, 125 miles, to Little Rock, beg-ging our food by the way, a meal at atime, as we had opportunity. After 
 visiting Little Rock, we travelled down the river ten miles, and tied up our canoe on the east bank, and stoppedwith Mr. Jones. I preached next day at his house. On the 16th we left our canoe with Mr. Jones, and walked back up the river ten miles, oppositeLittle Rock, and took the old militaryroad, and started to wade the Missis-sippi swamp, which was mostly cov-ered with water from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Memphis, Tennessee, a distance of about 175 miles. Wewaded through mud and water knee deep, day after day, and in some in-stances forty miles per day, before we could get a stopping place.On the 24th, while in the swamps, I had an attack of the rheumatism, and could not travel fast. My companion,brother Brown, had got in a hurry, and wished to return to his family in Kirtland; and as I could not travel as fast as he wished, we parted. He left me sitting on a log in the mudand water; I was lame and unable to walk, without food, and twelve miles from the nearest house on the road. He went out of sight in great haste.I then knelt down in the water, andprayed to the Lord to heal me. The Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I was healed; the pain left me; I arose and went my way. WheneverI met with one or more families, Ipreached and bore testimony to them.I crossed the Mississippi river in the evening of the 27th of March, and stayed at a public house kept by Mr.Josiah Jackson. I was suspected ofbeing an impostor. Mr. Jackson believed I was one of Murril's clan, who were then murdering and steal-ing negroes; and to test me, he gathered together a large house full of the most wicked and corrupt peo-ple in the city, and set me to preach-ing, to see whether I could preach or not.I do not think that Mr. Jackson, or the same company of men and women, will ever meet together again for the same purpose, for they would not like again to have their sins and abomina-tions revealed to each other as point-edly as I told them that night, through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost;they were glad to get rid of me uponalmost any terms.I travelled from Memphis to Middle Tennessee.April 4—I met with Elder Warren Parrish, in Benton county. He and David W. Patten had labored together through the winter in Tennessee, and baptized twenty persons. Elder Pat-ten had returned to Kirtland. I joined Elder Parrish, and we labored together over three months, travellingand preaching daily; baptizing suchas would receive our testimony; ex-tending our labors in Tennessee and Kentucky.June 23—We received a letter from Oliver Cowdery, requesting ElderParrish to come to Kirtland, and forme to remain and take charge of thesouthern churches, and the Lord would bless me in so doing.June 28—Warren Parrish ordained me an Elder. We baptized some forty persons while laboring together.July 23—Elder Parrish left. I travelled alone through the year, andextended my labors both in Kentucky and Tennessee. I baptized forty-threepersons during this season, thirty-oneafter brother Parrish left.Nov. 15—While travelling in thenight, with brother Benjamin L. Clapp and others, a tremendous storm of wind and rain overtook us. We came to a creek which had swollen to such an extent by the rain, that we could not cross without swimming our horses; several of the company were females. We undertook to head the stream, to ford it; but in the attempt,in the midst of the darkness and theraging of the wind and rain, we werelost in the thick woods, amidst therain, wind, creeks and fallen tree-tops. We crossed streams nearlytwenty times. I was reminded ofPaul's perils by water; but the Lordwas merciful unto us in the midst ofour troubles, for while we were grop-ing in the dark, running the risk of killing both ourselves and animals, by riding off precipitous bluffs, a bright light suddenly shone round about us, and revealed our perilous situation, as we were upon the edge of a deep gulf. The light continued withus until we found a house, and learned the right road; then the light dis-appeared, and we were enabled toreach the house of brother Henry 
 Thomas, at nine o'clock, all safe, hav-ing rode twenty miles, five hours in the storm, and we felt to thank theLord for our preservation.During the winter and spring, I continued to labor mostly alone, through Kentucky and Tennessee, opening new places, preaching daily, baptizing, confirming, and organizing new Branches.Feb. 26, 1836—At a Conference held at Brother B. L. Clapp's, inCallaway county, Kentucky, I or-dained A. O. Smoot and Benjamin Boydston, Elders, and B. L. Clapp and Daniel Thomas, Priests.Brothers Smoot and Clapp bothentered into the labors of the ministry. Elder Smoot frequently accompaniedme on my mission. Elder D. W. Patten returned to Tennessee in April, and joined us in our labors, accompanied by his wife. It was ahappy meeting. He related to methe blessings he had received in Kirt-land during the endowments. We travelled and labored together; perse-cution raged against us. Elder Pat-ten bore a strong and forcible testi-mony of the Work of God; and when we were opposed by mobs, he would rebuke them in great plainness; we were threatened, but not injured. Thesick were healed under our admini-strations.May 27—Elder Warren Parrish arrived from Kirtland. We held a Conference on the 28th, at brotherSeth Utley's. Seven Branches were represented, containing 116 members. Abel Wilson and Jesse Turpin were ordained Priests, and Albert Petty a Teacher.—31—I was ordained by David W. Patten, a member of the Second Quorum of Seventies.We labored over a circuit of severalhundred miles. Brother Smoot la-bored with us, and brother Clappfrequently. We travelled two by two, and all met together to hold Confe-rences.(To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 232.)HISTORY OFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-June 19—A States warrant was issued against D. W. Patten, WarrenParrish and Wilford Woodruff, sworn out by Matthew Williams, a Metho-dist priest, and served by the sheriff, Robert C. Petty. Elders Patten and Parrish were taken by an armed mob of about fifty, under pretence of law,led by the sheriff, a colonel, first and second major, with other officers, and a Methodist priest with a gun upon his shoulder. I was in another county, and therefore not taken. We wereaccused of prophesying falsely, by saying that four persons who were baptized should receive the HolyGhost in twenty-four hours, and that Christ should come the second timebefore this generation passed away. The whole concern was a mob mock trial, contrary to law, justice, judg-ment or truth.On the 29th, I went to a Baptistmeeting-house, on Thompson's creek, to preach; the house was crowded. As I rose to speak, a Baptist priest, Mr. Browning, arrived at the door on horseback, and stepped in greatly agitated, and told the deacon to forbid my preaching in the house, at thesame time commenced a tirade of abuse against the "Mormons," tellingseveral lies, which I corrected beforethe people, which increased his rage.As I was forbidden to preach in the house, and had been invited, and tra-velled many miles to fulfil my ap-pointment, I told the people I wouldlike to preach, and was willing to stand on a wood pile, a fence, a cart, or any place they would appoint. A man rose and said he owned the land in front of the meeting-house, and I might stand and preach on that, andwelcome. All the congregation, withthe exception of the minister and onedeacon, arose and left the house, walked across the street, and formed seats of a worm fence, and gave goodattention while I preached for an hour and-a-half, on the principles of theGospel.When I closed, Mr. Randolph Alex-ander, who had never heard a "Mor-mon" Elder speak before, said, the people of the present day made himthink of a pen of hogs; the keeperwould make a trough, and pour intoit hot or cold water, dish water, or anything else, and they would drink it; but let a stranger come along, and pour over a basket of corn on the back side of the pen, and the hogs would be frightened, and run and snort all over the pen. He said it was so with the people; the priests would feedthem with any kind of doctrine, no matter how false, the people will swallow it down; but let a strangercome and preach the Gospel of JesusChrist, which will save the people, as Mr. Woodruff has done, and the peo-ple are afraid of him.Mr. Alexander invited me home,bought a Book of Mormon, and wassoon baptized, and several othersfollowed his example.July 14—I wrote a letter to Oliver Cowdery, and sent him a list of sub-scribers for the Messenger and Advocate, and a detail of my mission in the south.—18—I rode in company with A. O. Smoot to a ferry on the Tennessee river. The ferryman was absent. We were offered the use of the boat, and ferried ourselves; but not beingmuch used to the business, and losingone oar in the river, and having torow with a broken oar, we landed a great distance below the usual place, 
 with a high circulation of blood andblistered hands; but our horses leaptthe bank, and we went on our way tothe Sandy, which we swam, and spent the night at Thomas Frazer's.—30—We preached at Mr. David Crider's, also on Sunday the 31st, where we were threatened by a mob.I baptized Mr. Crider amid the scoffs of the rabble, who went in the night and poisoned both of our horses; the one which I rode, belonging to brotherSamuel West, died in two days after-wards; brother Smoot's recovered; the swine that eat of the horse flesh also died.Aug. 11—I met with D. W. Patten and wife; he and brother Parrish had been driven out of Benton into Henrycounty, and Elder Parrish had left forKirtland.—29—We were visited by Elders T. B. Marsh and E. H. Groves, from Caldwell county, Mo.Sept. 2—We held a Conference at Damon's Creek, Callaway county, Kentucky; several Branches were re-presented, containing 119 members. Johnson F. Lane, Benjamin L. Clapp, and Randolph Alexander, were or-dained Elders, and Lindsey Bradey a priest, by D. W. Patten, who baptized five at the close of the Conference.I was released from my labors in the south, and counselled to go to Kirtland and receive my endowments,as was also A. O. Smoot.Sept. 19—Elders Marsh and D. W. Patten and wife, and E. H. Groves,started for Far West. I organized the first company of Saints who emi-grated from the Southern States, which numbered twenty-two souls. I ap-pointed Elder Boydston President of the company, and counselled them to be united, and to remember their prayers night and day before the Lord.—20—The camp started. I spent a few days visiting the Branches; bap-tized and confirmed eight, and ob-tained thirty subscribers for theMessenger and Advocate.(To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 248.)HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-Oct. 20—In company with A. O. Smoot and Jesse Turpin, I started for Kirtland; this was the first time I had ever travelled on a steamboat. We left the steamer at Louisville, onthe 28th, and spent nineteen daysvisiting Elder Smoot's relations, and preaching among the people; we visi-ted the Big Bone Lick. We arrived in Cincinnatti, Nov. 17th, where wesaw thirteen persons dead and wounded, taken from the steamer Flora, which had burst her pipeswhile running a race; arrived in Kirt-land on the 25th, and had the happy privilege of meeting the Prophet Joseph, and many Elders with whom I was acquainted in the Camp of Zion.—29—I heard Joseph preach in theTemple. In the afternoon I was called to speak, and read the ##Isaiah 56|56th chap##. of Isaiah, and made some re-marks, and gave an account of my mission in the south; Elder Smoot also addressed the Saints.I was counselled by the Presidencyto attend the school in the Temple, taught by Professor Haws. I studied the Latin language and English gram-mar, and boarded with brother Ira Bond.I attended meetings with the Seven-ties and other Quorums, during the winter of 1836-7, and received much valuable instruction.Dec. 20, 1836—I was present at theorganization of the Third Quorum of the Seventies; there were twenty-seven ordained.Jan. 3, 1837—I was set apart to be a member of the First Quorum ofSeventies.—25—At early candle light, a cloudbegan to arise in the north-east, and reached to the north-west, having theappearance of fire, and it soon spreadover the whole horizon. The reflec-tion of the clouds upon the earth, which was covered with snow, had a blood-red appearance. It com-menced at about 6 o'clock, and lastedtill past 10 p.m. 
 —29—Presidents Joseph Smith and O. Cowdery addressed the Saints inthe Temple. Joseph blessed the peo-ple in the name of the Lord, and said,if we would be faithful, we shouldarise above our embarrassments, and be delivered from the hands of our enemies.—30—I wrote an article on faith,which was published in the Messengerand Advocate.Feb. 19—I attended meeting at theTemple. President Joseph Smith hadbeen absent on business for the Church,but not half as long as Moses was in the mount away from Israel; yetmany of the people in Kirtland, if they did not make a calf to worship,as did the Israelites, turned their hearts away from the Lord, and from his servant Joseph, and had engaged in speculation, and given way to false spirits, until they were darkened in their minds; and many were op-posed to Joseph Smith, and some wished to appoint David Whitmer tolead the Church in his stead. [##Exodus 32:1-8##] In themidst of this cloud of dark spirits,Joseph returned to Kirtland, and this morning arose in the stand. He ap-peared much depressed; but soon the Spirit of God rested upon him, and he addressed the assembly in great plain-ness for about three hours, and puthis enemies to silence. When he arosehe said, "I am still the President, Prophet, Seer, Revelator and Leaderof the Church of Jesus Christ. God, and not man, has appointed and placed me in this position, and no manor set of men have power to remove me, or appoint another in my stead;and those who undertake this, if theydo not speedily repent, will burn their fingers and go to hell." He reprovedthe people sharply for their sins, dark-ness and unbelief. The power of Godrested upon him, and bore testimony that his sayings were true.March 23rd was spent in the Templeby the Saints in Kirtland, in fastingand prayer. Patriarch Joseph Smith, sen., presided. The Spirit of the Lord was poured out upon the people.A contribution was taken up for thepoor.April 4—I received my washings and anointings in the house of theLord. I spent the whole night in theTemple, with others of the Seventies, in prayer and fasting; the Spirit of the Lord rested upon us. Aftertwenty-four hours I partook of food.—6—The Presidency of the Church, the Twelve Apostles, and other Quo-rums, met in solemn assembly, and sealed upon our heads our washings,anointings and blessings, with a loud shout of hosannah to God and the Lamb; the Spirit of the Lord restedupon us. After spending three hoursin the upper room, the Quorums re-paired to the lower court; the vails were lowered, and the ordinance ofwashing of feet was administered.Elder H. C. Kimball washed my feet, and pronounced blessings upon me.After this ordinance, the vails of theTemple were rolled up, and President Joseph Smith addressed the Elders for three hours, clothed with the Spiritand power of God. He unbosomed his feelings in the house of his friends,and gave much instruction. He urgedupon us the absolute necessity of giving strict heed to his teachings and counsel, and the revelations of the Lord to the Church, and be wise in all things, that Zion and her stakesmay be redeemed and established, nomore to be thrown down. He said,that the kings of the earth would yet come to behold the glory of Zion, andthat great and glorious blessings wouldbe bestowed upon the Saints in the last days. Hyrum Smith bore testi-mony, and was followed by Oliver Cowdery, who exhorted the Elders tokeep within the bounds of their know-ledge, and let the mysteries of the kingdom alone, for the Gentiles hadnot a knowledge even of the first principles of the Gospel. He said, itis far better to preach what the people would call the small things of thekingdom, than to enter into the visions of Isaiah, Ezekiel and John. The Twelve broke bread, which was distri-buted to the multitude, who eat and were filled; thanks were returned, and the meeting closed at the setting of the sun.The house was again filled at candle light. President Smith requested the Elders to speak their feelings freely, and sing, exhort and pray, as the Spi-rit should give utterance. The meet-ing continued during the whole night; 
 many of the gifts were poured outupon the people; at break of day wewere dismissed.I also spent the night of the 7th inthe Temple, with several of the Elders, in prayer and praise before the Lord; the Holy Ghost rested upon us, and the spirit of prophecy was given, andmany things were shown by the holy Spirit.April 9—President Smith spoke inthe afternoon, and said in the name of the Lord, that the judgments ofGod would rest upon those men who had professed to be his friends, andfriends of humanity, and in building up Kirtland, a stake of Zion, but had turned traitors to him, and the inter-ests of the kingdom of God, and had given power into the hands of our enemies against us; they had oppressedthe poor Saints, and had brought dis-tress upon them, and had become covenant-breakers, for which they will feel the wrath of God.April 13, 1837—I married Phebe W. Carter, daughter of Ezra and Sarah Carter, of Scarborough, Maine. The ceremony was performed at thehouse of President Joseph Smith, byFred. G. Williams, Esq. The Pro-phet Joseph appointed to marry us,but his life was sought by a mob, andhe had to flee.—15—I received my patriarchal bles-sing under the hands of the Patriarch, Joseph Smith, sen.; my wife havingreceived her patriarchal blessing pre-viously. (To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 265.)HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-May 5—While laboring for Joseph Young, Kirtland was visited with a sudden storm of wind and rain, a cur-rent passed south of the Temple in the form of a whirlwind or tornado, whichdestroyed and injured several build-ings, it crushed one of Joseph Young's buildings, and removed the one we were in some 10 feet, but no person was injured.I felt impressed to go out upon amission; the Spirit was upon me, and led me to go to Fox Islands; it was acountry I had never visited. I namedmy feelings upon the subject to EldersKimball, Rigdon and others; they encouraged me to go. Elder Kimball blessed me, and said in the name of the Lord, I should be blessed and prospered on my mission, and do a good work. I proposed to Jonathan H. Hale to accompany me, which he did.May 31—I left my wife and friends in Kirtland, and walked to Fairport with brother Hale; we were joined byMilton Holmes, and took the steamer Sandusky and arrived in Buffalo, June 1st, and Syracuse on the 4th; walked36 miles to Richmond [Richland], Oswego county, New York, and called upon my two brothers, Azmon and Thomson, whom I had not seen for several years. We visited the churches as far as Sackett's Harbor, called upon ArchibaldPatten, and delivered to him some letters from Warren Parish, in which were enclosed many one hundreddollar bills, which he had taken fromthe Kirtland Bank.We crossed Lake Ontario, visitedUpper Canada, and attended a confe-rence, May 10th, with Elders John E. Page and James Blakesly, in the township of Bastard, Leeds County. There were eight branches represented, containing 300 members. 13 Elders, 5 Priests, 8 Teachers and 6 Deacons. Elder William Draper and myself ordained 7 Elders, 9 Priests, 11 Teach-ers, and 5 Deacons: five were baptizedby Elder Page at the close of the Con-ference.A woman was possessed of the devil and greatly afflicted, much of the time was dumb; four of us laid hands uponher, and cast the devil out in the name of Jesus Christ, and she was made whole, and gave thanks untoGod, and went on her way rejoic-ing.We visited several other Branches and preached the word of God, andseveral of the sick were healed.We returned to Kingston, took steamer for Oswego, and canal forAlbany; Brothers John Goodson, Isaac Russel and John Snider accom-panied us from Canada, and left us at Schenectady, to join Elders Kimball,Hyde and Richards at New York, togo to England.We walked from Albany to Farm-ington, Conn.; attended a conference of the Saints in Canaan; arrived atmy father's house July 6th. This was the first time I had seen my father or relatives in Conn., since I joined the Church; they received me kindly.On the 10th, I preached in the CityHall in Colinsville, and a mob gather-ed and attempted to break up themeeting, with fife and drum, holloa-ing and yelling; they were urged onby a Presbyterian priest. At the close of the meeting the priest came to me 
 with his rabble, and asked many ques-tions; he said I had no right to my opinion, and no man had a right topreach the gospel unless he had a collegiate education. I told him Iwould admit that point, when he wouldtell me at what college Jesus Christand his Apostles obtained their educa-tion: the priest and rabble then left.—12—I preached in a school house in West Avon to an attentive congre-gation; after meeting I baptized myuncle, Ozem Woodruff, his wife and son, John, in fulfilment of a dream which I had at ten years of age.I visited most of my relatives in Conn., and preached the Gospel to them.—16—I preached at Adna Hart'sin Avon, where I was met by my step-mother and sister, also by my wife, who had travelled alone from Kirtland, and was on her way to visit her fatherin Maine.—19—Elder Hale went to NewRowley, Mass., to visit his friends. I had been solicited to preach to thecitizens of Farmington by many promi-nent men, but every room which was offered me, including the town hall, was closed against me by the Rev.Noah Porter, pastor of the Presby-terian church, until the Methodistchurch was offered me, which he hadnot influence to close. Two hours after I gave out the appointment, the house was filled, and I preached to avery attentive congregation, including my father and his household, for an hour and a half, upon the first princi-ples of the Gospel; I gave liberty tothe assembly to ask any questions, orfind any fault with what I had said, but I met with no opposition.—20—I left my father's house, and, with my wife, rode by stage to Hart-ford.—21—Not having money to paythe fare for us both, I paid her fare inthe stage to New Rowley, Mass., andI walked through a hot sultry dayfifteen hours, averaging three and ahalf miles per hour, making 52miles.—22—I walked 48 miles.—23—I walked 36 miles, and ar-rived at Elder Nathaniel Holme's, in New Rowley, at two o'clock, p.m., making 136 miles in a little over two days and a half. I met with my wifeand Elder Milton Holmes, at his father's house: I spent several days in preaching to the Saints in that region.Aug. 1—We left New Rowley, and was joined by Elder Hale, who accom-panied us to Saco, Maine.—7—I accompanied my wife to herfather's in Scarborough, Maine. We were kindly received: it was the first time I had seen any of her relations. We found mother Carter very sick. I spent several days visiting the Saintsin that region.—10—I accompanied Ezra and Fabien Carter, my brothers-in-law, on a fishing excursion; we caughtwith hooks 250 codfish, haddock, and hake, and saw four whales; it beingthe first time I had ever seen that class of fish that swallowed Jonah.—18—With Elder Hale, I startedto fill my mission on Fox Islands; we walked to Portland, and spent the night at Mr. Samuel Hale's.—19—We took the steamer Bangor 85 miles to Owl's Head, where we arrived at sunset, without means toprosecute our journey further. We retired to a high hill, and bowed before the Lord, and prayed that hewould open our way; the spirit of theLord rested upon us, and testified unto us that our prayers would be answered. As we arose from ourknees, a sloop came into the harbor; we went to the captain, and enquired where he was going; he replied, through the channel of Vinal Haven; he took us on board and landed us onNorth Fox Islands, at 2 a.m. on the20th. We wandered in the dark aboutan hour, rambling over rocks and bushes, found the house of Mr. Natha-niel Dyer, and were entertained. Itbeing Sunday morning, Mr. Benjamin Kent piloted us to the Baptist meet-ing-house, occupied by Elder GideonJ. Newton, pastor of the only religious denomination upon the Island. At the door, I sent for the deacon, andtold him I wished him to inform theminister that we were servants of God,and wished to deliver a message tothat people. The minister sent word for us to come into the pulpit; accord-ingly, with valise in hand, we walked 
 up into the pulpit, and took a seat o n each side of him. When he closed hisdiscourse, he asked me what hour we would like to speak; I told him atfive; he gave out our appointment, and invited us to his house. I asked him how many school houses were on the Island; he said four, and gave me their names. I asked him if they were free for any one to preach in; heanswered in the affirmative. I tookout my Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and covenants, and laid them all upon his stand; he promised toread them. The hour of meeting arri-ved, and I preached to a full house upon the first principles of the Gospel, and bore testimony that the Lord hadraised up a prophet, and had com-menced to establish his church and Kingdom again upon the earth, infulfilment of his word, as spoken through the ancient Prophets and Apostles. This was the first discourseever delivered by any Latter-day Saint upon this chain of islands;Elder Hale bore testimony. I gaveout appointments for preaching inthe four school houses. The people came out in masses to investigate the principles which we taught. In four-teen days we preached nineteen dis-courses. Capt. Justice Ames and wife were baptized by Elder Hale.Elder Newton, the Baptist minister, with his family attended twelve of our meetings, read the books, and was convinced by the spirit of the Lord that our doctrine was true, and hehad a hard struggle in his mind to know which to do, receive or reject it; he finally resolved to reject it, and commenced preaching against us. Hesent for Mr. Douglass, Methodistminister, on the South Island, to come and help him; he had been long at variance with Mr. Douglass, but they became very friendly and united in awar against us. We continued preach-ing daily, until we baptized most of the members of Mr. Newton's church,and those who owned the meeting house.(To be continued.) 
 (Continued from page 281.)HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-I followed Mr. Douglas to his ownisland, and commenced preaching tohis church, and baptized a good share of his members, among whom wereseveral sea captains. Ministers from the main land were sent for, whocame over and tried to put a stop tothe work, by preaching and lyingabout us; but the work continued to roll on. They wished me to work amiracle to convince them that my doc-trine was true. I told them they had rejected the truth, and they would see signs, but not unto salvation.Vinal Haven, which includes both north and south Fox Island, is in lat.44°, long. 69°10'. The inhabitants are generally healthy and industrious, and hospitable to strangers, the people obtain most of their wealth by fishing, and fit out annually over one hundred licensed vessels, beside many smaller crafts. The north island is nine mileslong and two wide; population 800, and contains a post office, a store, a grist mill, four school houses, and a Baptist church. The land is rocky and rough, yet there are farms which produce good wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and grass; the principaltimber is fir, spruce, hemlock and birch. The rasp and gooseberry growin great abundance. Sheep are theprincipal stock.South Fox island is about ten mileslong and five wide, and is a mass ofrocks, principally granite, formed into shelves, hills, hollows, and cut up into nooks, points and ravines by covesand harbors; population 1000. Thereare some small patches under cultiva-tion, at the expense of great labor and toil. Many resident fishermen fish at Newfoundland, and bring them home, and dry them upon flakes; they annu-ally supply the market with a greatamount of codfish, mackerel and boxed herring. The latter island contains two stores, three tide saw mills, six school houses, a small branch
