RICHFIELD, UTAH, Jan. 25th 1898.  Pres. Wilford Woodruff, Dear Brother:  Enclosed herewith will be found my answer to your letter of the 12th instant, endorsed by my bishop as requested. The same gives a general statement of  my circumstances financially. My wife is somewhat conserned about my going at the time designated in my call, Apr 2nd 1898. She believes that the Lord desires me  to go on that date or I would not have received the call. She feels willing to take the apparent consequences, to loose her home, which is about all we have, and  to be left without any means of support for herself and children, so long as these  sacrifices are made in doing the will of the Lord. My feelings would be similar to those of my wife were it not for the fact that your letter contains  the words, "Should there be no reasonable obstacles to hinder you from going." The Lord in His goodness has given me a good wife and five sweet children, one of which He has recalled, and alone and unaided except by Him I have  provided them a home and the average necessities and comforts of life. I love my family next to my God and I do not feel that I will be justified in leaving them on the date designated unless you find, after considering my circumstances, that it is the Lord's will, and then I will do so cheerfully, no matter what may be the consequences, knowing that I am doing His will. Should you decide that it is the Lords will that I respond to the call on the  date named, I will do all in my power to comply, but should you, on the  other hand, decide that the Lord requires me to place my affairs in order, ENDENTRY Richfield, Sevier County, Utah, Jan.  President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah, Dear Brother:  In responce to your favor of the 12th instant, advis ing me that my name had been suggested and accepted as a missionary to  Scandinavisa, permit me to make the following statement of my private affairs:  My indebtedness on my home is $400 the mortage being held by the  Western Loan and Savings Co. of your city, in which company I hold seven shares of stock the monthly payment on which amounts to $8.40.  I hold certificate of purchase from the State on 40 acres of un- cultivated University Land on which the annual payment is $19.68.  The County Commissioners have just licensed me to conduct an Abstra^ct^ business in Sevier county and I have purchased records of the value of $50 which sum must be paid during the present year. I have also purchas- ed a small tract of land opposite the court house on which to erect a  building for the purpose of this business. This land cost me $120 of wh which amount I have paid $50 and $50 of the remaining $70 is to be paid in Nov. of the present year, and the balance, $20, in March 1899, otherwise I forfeit the amount now paid.  I owe the Jas. M. Peterson Bank of this city, $25; the Manti City  Savings Bank, Manti City, $110, and the Utah Cmo'1 and Savings Bank, Salt  Lake City, $37.50.  I own no real estate or other property that is at present bringing  me revenue, or likely to in the near future, or that I could at present  sell except at a great loss.  My only means of support for myself and family is derived from my daily labor.  I am at present under contract with Sevier county to complete cer- tain abstract records for which labor I will receive, when completed, $175.  At the last session of the County Commissioners I was appointed Deputy County Clerk for the year 1898 at a salary of $250.  I have about $200 worth of our county warrants which I think will be paid about the latter part of this year or first of next.  My family consists of my wife and four children, the age of the olde^st^ being eight years. I have no relatives that are in a position to aid them in my absence therefore whatever provision is made for their sup- port must be made by me before leaving.  My aged Father living in Idaho, is very week and feeble and has no one but me to look to for financial aid when the condition of his health is such that he cannot provide for himself and wife. He has no means of support excepting his own labor. ENDENTRY St. Joseph Mar. 21st 1898.

We would not then feel that we were disobeying His commands, but that  we were entitled to, and could claim His blessings in the same degree as if this call had not been issued. If an extention of time is granted me I would like to have a definite date fixed when I am to leave so that I may have something to work to, and during the time that I remain at home it shall be my aim to improve and fit and prepare myself for this labor in the cause of truth.

Since that time I have been very economical in money mat- ters but with all my economy, have been able to save but very little. I have been trying to get ready to go this year.

Richins July 18 1898 ENDENTRY I would come out all right if I have but little to start with. Others have advised me to remain at home until I have something to start with, telling me that it would only be a burden on the church to keep me. I therefore am almost puzzled to know what to do, as I have never been outside of Cache Valley, and know nothing of the expense of travelling. I will therefore submit this matter to  you for your decision.  I have a wife and one child. I have no home but have been compelled to rent during the 18 months we have been married. We had nothing to start us in life and were forced to contract several debts. I have had employment but part of the time and it has therefore taken about  all I have earned to pay my debts and keep us going. I have  no property and no one to depend on for help. I have paid all my debts and by the middle of June I think I shall have about $75 to start me. As for my wife, I think  she will be all right while I am gone as she has a number of relatives.  Will you please be kind enough to advise me what to do and I will gladly accept your decision. Should you advise me to go I shall try and be ready by the  middle of July. Should you decide for me not to go at present I shall continue to save what  I can, and will do what I can to prepare myself to fulfil a mission. Hoping to hear from you at an early date, I remain.
