 Private.San Francisco December 13th1894.To The Right ReverendThe President of the Church of Latter Day Saints,Salt Lake City.Right Reverend Sir!Enclosed I have the honor to presentto you a couple of my circulars relating to my great work"Reform," just published, and which has been most favorably commented upon by the papers and is an immense success. In the 5th chapter on Religion," I make an eloquent defence of the Mormon religion and adduce irrefutable arguments for it. I therefore[illegible] believe, that, aside from the other most valuable matter con-tained in my book, it will be greatly interesting to your people.The book contains 280 pages, is handsomely bound in cloth,gilt lettered on the cover, nice clear type, and measures 6x9".It sells at $1.25¢ at retail per copy but taken in quantities of25 and more, I can make a reduction of 35 cents. My contract with the printers reads that the whole edition must be paid for within 3 months, before I can dispose of any books for my own benefit; and being my own publisher, it is of vital interest to me to pay for the book as soon as possible. I have no acquaintance, nor correspondent, in your city and therefore make no free as to address you with the

 (2)the country over thoroughly in and aroundLevan, witg a view to obtaining ArtesianWater, and I find that after a verry thoroughexamination of the amount of waterwhich flows from the mountains here, andby estimating the amount of water shed, ormountain area, which supplies thewater for this locality, I am satisfiedthat there is a strong underflow in thisvalley, which if utalized would reclaimthousands of acres of the best land in Utah,which land is close to the R. R. and theclimate is moderate, and it would makean admirable place for a large number of homes.In several places in Southern Utah,including Iron Co. the people are successfullysinking Artesian Wells, and bringing hundredsof gallons of water to the surface, and Ifind that although the people here in Levanhave never tried to sink for Art. water, theyare verry much interested in the subject, andseveral with whom I have talked too, arewilling to spend their share of the amount

 TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES,GREETING.THERE IS NOW READY FOR DELIVERY,COLONEL RALPH DE CLAIRMONT'SGREAT BOOKREFORM,An Essay on the Political, Financial and Social Condition of theUnited States, showing Dangers, Defectsand Remedies.Bound in cloth, gilt lettering, price $1.25. Copyrighted.The book embraces the following important matter: Preface. Chapter I.Caveat Patria: II. Law and Justice; III. Legislation; IV. Press; V. Religion;VI. Education; VII. Finance; VIII. Federal Government; IX. United StatesArmy. Appendix: Constitution of the United States: Constitution of the SwissConfederation.The various subjects contained in this book are treated in an entirely impartial manner, froman independent and lofty standpoint, free from all bias and party spirit. The author has only thewelfare of the United States in general and that of the people at heart.The book is written in a bold and fearless style, pointing out all the dangers and evils of thepresent period and of the future, at the same time indicating the corresponding remedies. The styleof the book, though frequently sarcastical and full of indignation at the most flagrant abuses, is chasteand may be read by all, old and young, for their benefit and instruction; it is easy to comprehendby all classes of our people, from the merchant prince to the humble laborer.The last chapter, highly eulogistic of and recommending an increase of the United States Armyto fifty thousand men, besides advocating other important changes and improvements in the service,will be of the highest interest to the Officers of the Army.  They will find among other interestingtopics an account of the model organization of the army of Switzerland and reference to otherEuropean systems.The author begs to refer to the following flattering endorsement of his book by one of theprincipal staff officers of the U.S. Army:San Francisco, October 11, 1894."I commend to my brother officers and the public generally Colonel Ralph de Clairmont's book onthe POLITICAL, FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE UNITED STATES. It is a trenchantand vigorous essay on the times by an author of wide learning, extensive and accurate knowledge of history,vast experience in our national and in foreign affairs, and, above all, keen insight into the events of theday. It is a spicy survey of the existing conditions of our country, and wholly worthy of attentive perusaland study. And while it touches upon vital questions, it yet carries the reader along as delightfully asany sensible romance. It gives me sincere pleasure to heartily commend the work to others."The first edition is nearly all disposed of. In order to secure a copy of this great book, pleasesend your order by bearer, or by postal card, to R. de Clairmont, No. 6 Eddy Street, San Francisco,Cal., and it will be promptly forwarded to you upon payment of $1.25.
