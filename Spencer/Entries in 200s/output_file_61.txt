 John L. Finlayson  June 8 [18]94    Payson June 8, 1894.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother.    Last December I  received a letter from you stating  that my name had been accepted  as a missionary for Great Britain.  In answer I expressed my feelings  explained my circumstances and  was released till the close of the  school year or longer if I so   desired, in order to get better  prepared financially.    My school closed yesterday and  would now be pleased to start  as early as you may deem  desirable.    I will need some help in 
 works. I have a phrenological  delineation of my character, given  by Prof. Nelson Sizer, President of  the American Institute of Phrenology  at New York City, wherein he says,  "If I had the means to study  medicine, they think it would be  the best thing for me."    I you desire to see this chart, I   will with pleasure forward it to you,  so that you may see me phrenologic-  ally and be acquainted of my  character.    I truly realize that you will  require an almost unlimited source  of information as to my character,   habit, and standing, should this,  my earnest desire, receive your  attention and consideration.    I will with pleasure give all and  any desired information of myself. 
 coming two year old, which  I will be able to sell in the  spring as soon as they are  shorn. It would give me a  chance to get out of Debt, and  give me a little money go on.   Another reason for wanting  an extention of time is:   My Wife will be confined  sometime in April and she  feels very delicate about having   me leave before then. If you  deem my reason's sufficient  to warant a delay of four months  I think I could leave things in  a more satisfactory shape.  If not, I am willing to abide  by your decission.

I can say that I am  young and unexperienced in  the Principles of the Gospel, olnly   18 years of age.  And also close   for means, but with the aid   of my Parents I am willing to   go and do the best I can 
 Them more room, as they are liveing   in a small unfinished leanto to the  house, I not haveing had means to  continue the work with hiered help  thought I would work at it myself  as often as I could find a little time.  My Parents ar both liveing in this  place, both over 70 years of age,  and my Father haveing lost his  eyesight entirly in the last few  years, and haveing a younger woman  with 2 small girls, and him having  not quite 4 akers of lot and land  together when rentet out leaves  a very little for them too live upon  he had bin working at differant trades  but know he can no longer work  at these trades. So Father has  asked for me and my Brothr Christian  whom you have also sent a call with  mine to go on a mission, and we two  being all the boys which Father  has a living. so if we both should  go on a mission there would only  be my boy left to helpout in the  three Familys, and I havent gat  the means at present to go with,  and money seems to be hard to get ahold  of. I donnt know where where I could  sell a workorse or a milkscow to  get money to go with. I have retur  returned from a mission to Switszer-  land on the last day of June 1888.  I have presided over two conferensis  a good portion of my time there.  I am willing to go again, and do  the best I can again, and that  as soon as I can make it posable,  if you feel to say for me to go  when you have red or learned my  sircumstances, for I desire to spend  ^^my^ lifetime^ in usefulness and doing good.    I remain truly your brother in the  Gospel.   John S Stucki    per John G. Hafen. Bp.    Jacob Tobler counselor.    See over.

 Who is it that recommended  bro. Stucki to this Mission.  Who ever he is, he should  go on a mission himself   or stop recommending  anybody, till he knows  what he is doing.    Let him be honorably  excused. J. F. S.    Bro Stucki was not called, simply  a letter of inquiry written to him, nor  was he recommended by any one.

Dear Sir,    In regards to my call as   a missionary, can say nothing  else but I will accept  the call but on acount of my   surcumstanses I think that   if a little time for preperation  could be given it would be   much better for me    As I have no ready means  at present and know of no  way of obtaining any until  about spring    Have talked with ^the Bishop^ about it   and he sanctions a little ^time^ for  preperation.  But of course  you are the master in this case

 Private.    San Francisco December 13th1894.    To The Right Reverend  The President of the Church of Latter Day Saints,  Salt Lake City.    Right Reverend Sir!    Enclosed I have the honor to present  to you a couple of my circulars relating to my great work  "Reform," just published, and which has been most favorably   commented upon by the papers and is an immense success. In   the 5th chapter on Religion," I make an eloquent defence of the   Mormon religion and adduce irrefutable arguments for it. I therefore  [illegible] believe, that, aside from the other most valuable matter con-  tained in my book, it will be greatly interesting to your people.    The book contains 280 pages, is handsomely bound in cloth,  gilt lettered on the cover, nice clear type, and measures 6x9".  It sells at $1.25¢ at retail per copy but taken in quantities of  25 and more, I can make a reduction of 35 cents. My contract   with the printers reads that the whole edition must be paid for within   3 months, before I can dispose of any books for my own benefit; and   being my own publisher, it is of vital interest to me to pay for the   book as soon as possible. I have no acquaintance, nor correspondent,   in your city and therefore make no free as to address you with the

 TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES,  GREETING.    THERE IS NOW READY FOR DELIVERY,  COLONEL RALPH DE CLAIRMONT'S  GREAT BOOK    REFORM,    An Essay on the Political, Financial and Social Condition of the  United States, showing Dangers, Defects  and Remedies.    Bound in cloth, gilt lettering, price $1.25. Copyrighted.    The book embraces the following important matter: Preface. Chapter I.  Caveat Patria: II. Law and Justice; III. Legislation; IV. Press; V. Religion;  VI. Education; VII. Finance; VIII. Federal Government; IX. United States  Army. Appendix: Constitution of the United States: Constitution of the Swiss  Confederation.    The various subjects contained in this book are treated in an entirely impartial manner, from  an independent and lofty standpoint, free from all bias and party spirit. The author has only the  welfare of the United States in general and that of the people at heart.  The book is written in a bold and fearless style, pointing out all the dangers and evils of the  present period and of the future, at the same time indicating the corresponding remedies. The style  of the book, though frequently sarcastical and full of indignation at the most flagrant abuses, is chaste  and may be read by all, old and young, for their benefit and instruction; it is easy to comprehend  by all classes of our people, from the merchant prince to the humble laborer.    The last chapter, highly eulogistic of and recommending an increase of the United States Army  to fifty thousand men, besides advocating other important changes and improvements in the service,  will be of the highest interest to the Officers of the Army.  They will find among other interesting  topics an account of the model organization of the army of Switzerland and reference to other  European systems.    The author begs to refer to the following flattering endorsement of his book by one of the  principal staff officers of the U.S. Army:    San Francisco, October 11, 1894.    "I commend to my brother officers and the public generally Colonel Ralph de Clairmont's book on  the POLITICAL, FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE UNITED STATES. It is a trenchant  and vigorous essay on the times by an author of wide learning, extensive and accurate knowledge of history,  vast experience in our national and in foreign affairs, and, above all, keen insight into the events of the  day. It is a spicy survey of the existing conditions of our country, and wholly worthy of attentive perusal  and study. And while it touches upon vital questions, it yet carries the reader along as delightfully as  any sensible romance. It gives me sincere pleasure to heartily commend the work to others."    The first edition is nearly all disposed of. In order to secure a copy of this great book, please  send your order by bearer, or by postal card, to R. de Clairmont, No. 6 Eddy Street, San Francisco,  Cal., and it will be promptly forwarded to you upon payment of $1.25.

I am anxious to go, and if you had some  place close by, where I could come home on short  notice, in case of an immergency, I will go  out the first possible opportunity. Am getting  my private debts almost paid up and if it  were not for these endorsements, I would be O. K.  Hoping to hear from you soon.    I remain  Your Bro:  S. O. Crosby    By all means give him  time to free himself from debt.  Let him report when ready. J. F. S.
