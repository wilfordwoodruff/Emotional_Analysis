The same gives a general statement of  my circumstances financially. My wife is somewhat conserned about my going at the time designated in my call, Apr 2 to go on that date or I would not have received the call. She feels willing to take the apparent consequences, to loose her home, which is about all we have, and  to be left without any means of support for herself and children, so long as these  sacrifices are made in doing the will of the Lord. My feelings would be similar to those of my wife were it not for the fact that your letter contains  the words, "Should there be no reasonable obstacles to hinder you from going." The Lord in His goodness has given me a good wife and five sweet children, one of which He has recalled, and alone and unaided except by Him I have  provided them a home and the average necessities and comforts of life. I love my family next to my God and I do not feel that I will be justified in leaving them on the date designated unless you find, after considering my circumstances, that it is the Lord's will, and then I will do so cheerfully, no matter what may be the consequences, knowing that I am doing His will. Should you decide that it is the Lords will that I respond to the call on the  date named, I will do all in my power to comply, but should you, on the  other hand, decide that the Lord requires me to place my affairs in order, ENDENTRY    Salt Lake City, Utah, Dear Brother:   ing me that my name had been suggested and accepted as a missionary to  Scandinavi affairs:   Western Loan &amp; Savings Co. of your city, in which company I hold seven shares of stock the monthly payment on which amounts to $8.40.   cultivated University Land on which the annual payment is $19.68.   business in Sevier county and I have purchased records of the value of $50 which sum must be paid during the present year.
