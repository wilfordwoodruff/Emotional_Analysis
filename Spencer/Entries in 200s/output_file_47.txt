If so, to respect-fully request that you consider me an applicant. If there is notany way which I can serve you here, I shall be pleased to come toSalt Lake City or to go to any place which you may direct.I am a young man, 27 years old; have been a student at theJohns Hopkins University, and am a graduate of the Law Dept. of the University of Maryland.I am at present employed, but my position is in many ways notcongeniel, but being dependent upon it and having a mother to lookafter, has in a great measure precluded me from securing anothersituation more suited to my taste.In the event of employing me, there is no doubt but that youwill find me valuable to you. I do not say this is the spirit ofconceit, but because I know that a man of any ability, who is anhonorable man, as I trust I am; and who will be as loyal to yourinterests as I shall be, is always a valuable man.If you decide to give me a trial, I shall give you satisfacto-ry reference as to my character, mental qualifications &c.I solicit your careful consideration for the above, and am sat-isfied if you decide to take me into your service that you will notregret having done so.Yours very respectfully,James R Read.1315 Mulberry St.

 I came near sending my son Jos.A. to Turkey but found it wouldseriously interrupt his study of theGerman language. He is stationedin Berlin now, and he asked the privilege of going to the universityfor a year to perfect him^self^ in the lan-guage. I consented on the groundthat he would complete his miss-ion after the year was ended. Therewas no time to ask your advice ^for the university opened in a few days.^ &I took this liberty, for another reasonhe represented that he believed a newopening to preach the gospel ^among the students^ couldbe made and he strenuously advo-cated giving the educated classesa chance. I have thought he couldfinish his mission in Turkey provid-ing it met your mind. However thatcan be considered in its time.Immigration companies are going of-ten now. Nearly every saturday weshall have more or less going out.We find the sterage is not nearlyso comfortable on the Alaskaand Arizona, as it is on the otherthree vessels of the Guion line.I leave for Copenhagen tomor-row morning. I leave everythingin good running order so faras I know.
