ENDENTRY      and bear my testimony unto you, concerning certain things that are presented to  you for your consideration; especially, the claims of elder Sidney Rigdon to the  exclusive right to lead and govern the church of Latter-day Saints. I have care- fully examined the trial which elder Rigdon has had before the authorities of the church in Nauvoo, as given in the  satisfied that a righteous decision has been given in his case. I do not make these  remarks without my reasons, and I will hereby give those reasons.   flaming speech in Far West, which had a tendency to bring persecution upon the whole church, especially the head of it? Has he stood by the side of the prophet and patriarch as a true friend, to assist in carrying them through their trials, tribu- lations, and persecutions; Has he walked up into his place as a man of God, and stood beside the prophet as his counsellor? Has he in any way, been a pillar or  support to the church, from that day until this? Has he sustained the cause, and used an influence to spread the work abroad since the persecution in Far West?  Has he in any way sustained the priesthood with dignity and honour, for the last five years of his life? Or, has the prophet, in any point of view, leaned upon him as a counsellor, a staff, or support, for the last five years? Or has the prophet  Joseph found elder Rigdon in his councils, when he organized the quorum of the  Twelve a few months before his death, to prepare them for the endowment? And  when they received their endowment, and actually received the keys of the kingdom of God, and oracles of God, keys of revelation, and the pattern of heavenly things;  and thus addressing the Twelve, exclaimed, "upon your shoulders the kingdom  rests, and you must round up your shoulders and bear it, for I have had to do it  until now. But now the responsibility rests upon you. It mattereth not what  becomes of me." I say, has this been the case with elder Rigdon, in any wise. No, no, verily no; but the reverse, until he had become like a millstone upon the back of Joseph Smith, the prophet, seer, and revelator. And I hereby bear my testimony, that I heard the said Joseph Smith declare, that elder Rigdon had be- come like a millstone upon his back—a dead weight—and he had carried him long enough, and must throw him off; and in my hearing requested one of the quorum  of the Twelve to bring him up before the Church, that he might be dealt with according to the law of the Church, that he might be cut off as a dead branch, and no longer encumber the tree, as there was sufficient testimony against him. But through the pleadings of brother Hyrum Smith and others, he has been spared. Elder Brigham Young has been his friend—spoke in his favour, in consequence of  his age and former standing, hoping that he might reform, got the spirit of the  work, and magnify his calling. Upon this principle he has been sustained long, until the branch became twice dead, and necessary to be severed from the tree.  Elder Rigdon, for the last five years of his life, has mostly been shut up in the  post-office; confined himself mostly to his own temporal affairs, manifesting but little interest in the affairs of the church; and when any alarm or report was in  circulation unfavourable to the cause, if we could judge at all from the course he ENDENTRY  Dec. 4 1895 ENDENTRY  Mar. 7 1895. ENDENTRY  it. It is true, that elder Rigdon attended some of the councils that president  Smith held with the Twelve and others, before his death, while giving them instruc- tions; but I heard president Smith say, that he came in without his wish or invi- tation, as he had no confidence in him. Elder Rigden and his friends would now claim, before the church and the world, that he holds the keys of the kingdom of  God of the last dispensation, above the Twelve, the church, &amp;c. I am ready to  admit before the whole church and the world, that he does hold one key be- yond the Twelve; one that they do not hold—one that God never held, nor Jesus  Christ, nor any true prophet, patriarch, or apostle; Joseph and Hyrum Smith were utter strangers to it. And if we can judge from his own mouth, according to the testimony given on his trial, we would suppose that Lucifer, who made  war in heaven, was its author; and that it had been handed down unto  the present day, and with it elder Rigdon has unlocked his heart, and pour- trayed before our eyes what was in it. What is it? Hear it, all ye Latter-day  Saints! Listen, O Earth, and judge the fruits of this Key. He threatens to turn traitor, publish against the church in public journals, intimating that he would bring a mob upon the church, stir up the world against the saints, and bring dis- tress upon them, &amp;c.  a sufficient reason for any true hearted Latter-day Saint to turn away from him with disgust, and treat all such men and principles according to their desert, which is, to let them entirely alone; for a more despicable principle never ex- isted in heaven, earth, or hell, than to prove a traitor to our God, our cause, and  our friends, and bring distress upon the innocent, and that too by turning against the very cause that a man has spent a portion of his life to build up, and declared,  while in the faith, that it was true and righteous; for in all such cases there is  entirely a misrepresentation of truth and facts, in order to accomplish the intended evil, while a true statement of facts would advance the cause. This same prin- ciple was manifest in the case of Lucifer, Judas, Arnold, and many apostates in  this church, who, when they could not get their own ends answered, would  threaten to bring mobs upon the church, and in some instances have done so. I would ask has Joseph or Hyrum Smith ever held such a key as this, or manifested  such a spirit as this? No, never; they have despised it in their hearts. President  Smith seemed to be sensible that such fruit was growing in the breast of elder Rigdon; and if he had accomplished what duty appeared to present to his mind  upon that subject, that branch would have been severed from the tree before his  death; but through mercy it was spared until it has produced fruit which is evil in its tendency, and dangerous to the welfare of the Church and Kingdom of God.   the key above spoken of, or any spirit or disposition to turn against the church in any time of trial or persecution from its commencement? Has he ever deserted  Joseph, Hyrum, his brethren, or the cause, in one instance, since the foundation of  this church? No, never, in one instance. He has always been ready to go and  come at the bidding of the Lord. He has not said so; but he has always said  come. He has set the example and led the way, until he has traversed sea and  land, at home and abroad, native and foreign countries, until he has borne off the keys of the kingdom of God in connexion with the Twelve, with honour and dig- nity, since they were committed to his charge. He has followed President Smith's  footsteps closely for the last twelve years of his life, and especially the last five years; while elder Rigdon has, at the same time, been confined to the Post-office,  apparently manifesting no interest in the welfare of the church and building up of the cause. The spirit of wisdom and counsel has manifested itself in the course  and deliberations of elder Young. He has not only had much experience with  president Smith, but he has proved himself true and faithful in all things commit- ted to his charge, until he was called to hold the keys of the kingdom of God in all the world, in connexion with the Twelve, was the first to receive his endowment,  from the hands of the prophet and patriarch, who have leaned upon him in con- nexion with the Twelve, for years, to bear off this kingdom in all the world. And they have done it with honour, labouring both day and night, making every sacrifice ENDENTRY    Salt Lake City    and Smith:     Receipt for care of Karraka bro. at St. Marks hospital; 7 weeks and 3 days is the time we have been obliged to keep him there.

And I can say with every sentiment of my heart, and feeling of my soul, as has president  Joseph and  the temple, and are willing to do right in all things, let me be one of that number."  If it cost me my life to defend the truth of the everlasting gospel of the Son of God,  and to build upon the great and mighty foundation which God has laid in this last  dispensation and fulness of times, through the instrumentality of his servant Joseph,  the prophet, seer, and revelator, for the pruning of the vineyard once more for the last time, for the warning of the Gentiles, for the salvation of the honest in heart,  and meek of the earth, the building up of Zion, the establishment of Jerusalem, the final deliverance of Israel, and to prepare the Saints for the hour of judgment which  is to come, and to secure unto the righteous an exaltation of glory beyond the veil;  I say, if it cost me my life, let it go; I want to be among the number; I am ready to follow the example of those who have gone before me—when my work is done,  I am ready to be offered, if necessary.   man turn traitor, shed innocent blood and damn his own soul—for the object in living and labouring in the cause of God is to secure a part in the first resurrection, eternal life, and immortal glory. A religion that is not worth maintaining at the expense of life is not worth having, "for he that will seek to save his life shall lose it, and he that will lay  down his life for my sake, the same shall find it." "And again, I will prove you, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, saith the Lord." Many of the patriarchs,  prophets, Jesus, the apostles, Hyrum, and many others, have sealed  their testimony with their blood.   up the work, because elder Rigdon threatens to turn traitor or bring mobs upon us, because  he cannot make the church bow to his notion of things? No, God forbid. It shows very  clearly that he has not the spirit of Christ, for the Lord nor one of his followers ever did  such a thing; and it is sufficient to open the mind of every saint to see where he stands.   As far as my faith, prayers, influence, and labor, will effect anything, they will go to sus- tain president Young, and in connexion with him the quorum of the Twelve, in holding the keys of the kingdom of God, as they have been delivered unto them by the revelation of Jesus Christ, and in the endowments they have received under the hands of the prophet Joseph, and also all the quorums of the church as they have been set in order in the church and kingdom of God in these last days, through the voice of the prophet, seer, and revelator, who has been raised up and laid the foundation, and sealed his testimony with  his blood.   when we need a double portion of the spirit of Joseph's God to rest upon us, we should  gird up the loins of our minds. Watch and be sober, maintain the priesthood with dignity,  have the cause of God fully at heart, labor faithfully for its promotion while the day lasts,  for night will soon come when no man can work. We should practice virtue and holiness  before the Lord, and shun the very appearance of evil. We should enter our closets, and  call upon God for wisdom to direct us in every duty in life. Our object should be to  preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to this generation, and present those principles that will save the souls of men.   tereth not what his standing may be, whether among the Twelve, the High Priests, Seven- ties, or Elders, or in any other standing, there is a tribunal that will reach their case in process of time, there is authority before whom they can be tried. Therefore let no one  turn against the cause of God, and stop in the road to destruction, on the plea that some- body has done wrong: it is no excuse for you or I to do wrong because another does:  the soul that sins, alone must bear it. Should I step aside from the path of duty it would  not destroy the gospel of Jesus Christ, or even one principle of eternal truth, they would  remain the same. Neither would it be any excuse for you to commit sin! but I should have to bear my own sins, and not the sins of others—so with all men.   jesty and dignity of your calling, make full proof of your ministry and covenant. Sustain  by your works the authorities, keys, and priesthood, of God in all its bearings and appen- dages, through this last dispensation, for the eyes of God, angels and men, are over you, and when the work is finished, you will receive your just recompence of reward.

It was also given to me to  conceive how the other part of this teaching, if carried out, would soon develop in a beautiful feature of our fast meetings, wich might relieve them of the dullness, that is creeping upon them. An hour spent in self-review  among brethren, what a blessing that might prove for those that partake in it!   of that kind and one that might attempt to break the ice by opening his heart before his brethren, would feel chilled and close up upon himself again, if there was no response to his sentiments. In other words, unless the meetings should be conducted accordingly, one individual alone would hardly dare to enter this field wich is an unknown country to most of us.  And I am sorry to state that in my wanderings in these 2 years I have not seen nor heard of any move in this direction and now your ruling seems to dispense altogether with the necessity to do so.
