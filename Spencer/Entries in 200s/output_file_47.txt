Dear Bro  Reynolds,  this morning, in relation to Bro Herbert Horsley, and by the same mail came Bro Horsley himself with a letter from his Bishop.  Bro Horsley manifested a very good disposition, and I believe he is now under the influence of the right spirit,  and I have considerable confidence that he will do a good work.  He is an old friend of mine, and we had a confidential conver- sation which resulted in withdrawing any objection on my part to his going on his mission.  I told him that the information the Presidency acted upon was sent by me, and why I felt under an obligation to send it.  He did not dispute what I had heard. I had in the meantime sent for his Bro Thos Horsley, my informant, not knowing but Herbr Herbert might request my authority, but he did not, and I of- course let it rest not wishing to have possible trouble.  Bro Horsley has not been slandered. The Bishops letters do not defend him, or justify him, only as to his present desires, all from good feelings on their part, as they think with all his friends that this mission is a turning point in Bro Horsleys life, and I have better hopes today for him than I have had for many years. I believe this check has been a blessing to him, and he went away feeling first-rate.  I make a somewhat lengthy statement, as I do not wish to be considered too particular, and if I told you how long we have ENDENTRY Suppose we postpone his call  for a year, with the understand- ing that he will prepare himself to take a mission, at that time.

I deem it to be a duty which I owe to God and his church, to express my feelings and bear my testimony unto you, concerning certain things that are presented to  you for your consideration; especially, the claims of elder Sidney Rigdon to the  exclusive right to lead and govern the church of Latter-day Saints. I have care- fully examined the trial which elder Rigdon has had before the authorities of the church in Nauvoo, as given in the Times and Seasons, Vol. v. No. 17, and I am  satisfied that a righteous decision has been given in his case. I do not make these  remarks without my reasons, and I will hereby give those reasons.  I will commence by asking where has elder Rigdon been since he made his flaming speech in Far West, which had a tendency to bring persecution upon the whole church, especially the head of it? Has he stood by the side of the prophet and patriarch as a true friend, to assist in carrying them through their trials, tribu- lations, and persecutions; Has he walked up into his place as a man of God, and stood beside the prophet as his counsellor? Has he in any way, been a pillar or  support to the church, from that day until this? Has he sustained the cause, and used an influence to spread the work abroad since the persecution in Far West?  Has he in any way sustained the priesthood with dignity and honour, for the last five years of his life? Or, has the prophet, in any point of view, leaned upon him as a counsellor, a staff, or support, for the last five years? Or has the prophet  Joseph found elder Rigdon in his councils, when he organized the quorum of the  Twelve a few months before his death, to prepare them for the endowment? And  when they received their endowment, and actually received the keys of the kingdom of God, and oracles of God, keys of revelation, and the pattern of heavenly things;  and thus addressing the Twelve, exclaimed, "upon your shoulders the kingdom  rests, and you must round up your shoulders and bear it, for I have had to do it  until now. But now the responsibility rests upon you. It mattereth not what  becomes of me." I say, has this been the case with elder Rigdon, in any wise. No, no, verily no; but the reverse, until he had become like a millstone upon the back of Joseph Smith, the prophet, seer, and revelator. And I hereby bear my testimony, that I heard the said Joseph Smith declare, that elder Rigdon had be- come like a millstone upon his backâ€”a dead weightâ€”and he had carried him long enough, and must throw him off; and in my hearing requested one of the quorum  of the Twelve to bring him up before the Church, that he might be dealt with according to the law of the Church, that he might be cut off as a dead branch, and no longer encumber the tree, as there was sufficient testimony against him. But through the pleadings of brother Hyrum Smith and others, he has been spared. Elder Brigham Young has been his friendâ€”spoke in his favour, in consequence of  his age and former standing, hoping that he might reform, got the spirit of the  work, and magnify his calling. Upon this principle he has been sustained long, until the branch became twice dead, and necessary to be severed from the tree.  Elder Rigdon, for the last five years of his life, has mostly been shut up in the  post-office; confined himself mostly to his own temporal affairs, manifesting but little interest in the affairs of the church; and when any alarm or report was in  circulation unfavourable to the cause, if we could judge at all from the course he ENDENTRY Wm I. Norton Dec. 4 1895 ENDENTRY W. L. Skidmore Mar. 7 1895. ENDENTRY pursued, it had a tendency to increase trouble and disturbance, instead of decreasing  it. It is true, that elder Rigdon attended some of the councils that president  Smith held with the Twelve and others, before his death, while giving them instruc- tions; but I heard president Smith say, that he came in without his wish or invi- tation, as he had no confidence in him. Elder Rigden and his friends would now claim, before the church and the world, that he holds the keys of the kingdom of  God of the last dispensation, above the Twelve, the church, andc. I am ready to  admit before the whole church and the world, that he does hold one key be- yond the Twelve; one that they do not holdâ€”one that God never held, nor Jesus  Christ, nor any true prophet, patriarch, or apostle; Joseph and Hyrum Smith were utter strangers to it. And if we can judge from his own mouth, according to the testimony given on his trial, we would suppose that Lucifer, who made  war in heaven, was its author; and that it had been handed down unto  the present day, and with it elder Rigdon has unlocked his heart, and pour- trayed before our eyes what was in it. What is it? Hear it, all ye Latter-day  Saints! Listen, O Earth, and judge the fruits of this Key. He threatens to turn traitor, publish against the church in public journals, intimating that he would bring a mob upon the church, stir up the world against the saints, and bring dis- tress upon them, andc. Times and Seasons, vol. v. p. 650â€”653. This ought to be a sufficient reason for any true hearted Latter-day Saint to turn away from him with disgust, and treat all such men and principles according to their desert, which is, to let them entirely alone; for a more despicable principle never ex- isted in heaven, earth, or hell, than to prove a traitor to our God, our cause, and  our friends, and bring distress upon the innocent, and that too by turning against the very cause that a man has spent a portion of his life to build up, and declared,  while in the faith, that it was true and righteous; for in all such cases there is  entirely a misrepresentation of truth and facts, in order to accomplish the intended evil, while a true statement of facts would advance the cause. This same prin- ciple was manifest in the case of Lucifer, Judas, Arnold, and many apostates in  this church, who, when they could not get their own ends answered, would  threaten to bring mobs upon the church, and in some instances have done so. I would ask has Joseph or Hyrum Smith ever held such a key as this, or manifested  such a spirit as this? No, never; they have despised it in their hearts. President  Smith seemed to be sensible that such fruit was growing in the breast of elder Rigdon; and if he had accomplished what duty appeared to present to his mind  upon that subject, that branch would have been severed from the tree before his  death; but through mercy it was spared until it has produced fruit which is evil in its tendency, and dangerous to the welfare of the Church and Kingdom of God.  I would again ask, has elder Brigham Young ever manifested any knowledge of the key above spoken of, or any spirit or disposition to turn against the church in any time of trial or persecution from its commencement? Has he ever deserted  Joseph, Hyrum, his brethren, or the cause, in one instance, since the foundation of  this church? No, never, in one instance. He has always been ready to go and  come at the bidding of the Lord. He has not said so; but he has always said  come. He has set the example and led the way, until he has traversed sea and  land, at home and abroad, native and foreign countries, until he has borne off the keys of the kingdom of God in connexion with the Twelve, with honour and dig- nity, since they were committed to his charge. He has followed President Smith's  footsteps closely for the last twelve years of his life, and especially the last five years; while elder Rigdon has, at the same time, been confined to the Post-office,  apparently manifesting no interest in the welfare of the church and building up of the cause. The spirit of wisdom and counsel has manifested itself in the course  and deliberations of elder Young. He has not only had much experience with  president Smith, but he has proved himself true and faithful in all things commit- ted to his charge, until he was called to hold the keys of the kingdom of God in all the world, in connexion with the Twelve, was the first to receive his endowment,  from the hands of the prophet and patriarch, who have leaned upon him in con- nexion with the Twelve, for years, to bear off this kingdom in all the world. And they have done it with honour, labouring both day and night, making every sacrifice ENDENTRY A. Carrington Young, M. D.  Hooper Building Salt Lake City Jany 11th 1896  Presidents Woodruff, Cannon and Smith:  Dear Brethren:  I enclose Receipt for care of Karraka bro. at St. Marks hospital; 7 weeks and 3 days is the time we have been obliged to keep him there.  Removed him to the nations grantors, this afternoon. Through the blessings of the Lord, he can now walk around; his arm is doing well, but he will have to be treated for many weeks to  come. If all continues favorable, the injured member will be of much use.  Bro. James Jack kindly furnished me the money to pay hospital expense; ENDENTRY required of them; leaving their homes, families and country, to establish the work  of God, and lay the foundation for the deliverance and redemption of Israel. And I can say with every sentiment of my heart, and feeling of my soul, as has president  Joseph and  the temple, and are willing to do right in all things, let me be one of that number."  If it cost me my life to defend the truth of the everlasting gospel of the Son of God,  and to build upon the great and mighty foundation which God has laid in this last  dispensation and fulness of times, through the instrumentality of his servant Joseph,  the prophet, seer, and revelator, for the pruning of the vineyard once more for the last time, for the warning of the Gentiles, for the salvation of the honest in heart,  and meek of the earth, the building up of Zion, the establishment of Jerusalem, the final deliverance of Israel, and to prepare the Saints for the hour of judgment which  is to come, and to secure unto the righteous an exaltation of glory beyond the veil;  I say, if it cost me my life, let it go; I want to be among the number; I am ready to follow the example of those who have gone before meâ€”when my work is done,  I am ready to be offered, if necessary.  I had rather see ten men seal a righteous testimony with their blood, than to see one man turn traitor, shed innocent blood and damn his own soulâ€”for the object in living and labouring in the cause of God is to secure a part in the first resurrection, eternal life, and immortal glory. A religion that is not worth maintaining at the expense of life is not worth having, "for he that will seek to save his life shall lose it, and he that will lay  down his life for my sake, the same shall find it." "And again, I will prove you, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, saith the Lord." Many of the patriarchs,  prophets, Jesus, the apostles, Hyrum, and many others, have sealed  their testimony with their blood.  Shall we then, as elders of Israel, or Latter-day Saints, back out, fear and tremble, or give  up the work, because elder Rigdon threatens to turn traitor or bring mobs upon us, because  he cannot make the church bow to his notion of things? No, God forbid. It shows very  clearly that he has not the spirit of Christ, for the Lord nor one of his followers ever did  such a thing; and it is sufficient to open the mind of every saint to see where he stands.   As far as my faith, prayers, influence, and labor, will effect anything, they will go to sus- tain president Young, and in connexion with him the quorum of the Twelve, in holding the keys of the kingdom of God, as they have been delivered unto them by the revelation of Jesus Christ, and in the endowments they have received under the hands of the prophet Joseph, and also all the quorums of the church as they have been set in order in the church and kingdom of God in these last days, through the voice of the prophet, seer, and revelator, who has been raised up and laid the foundation, and sealed his testimony with  his blood.  And I wish to say to all the elders of Israel and saints of God, that the time has come,  when we need a double portion of the spirit of Joseph's God to rest upon us, we should  gird up the loins of our minds. Watch and be sober, maintain the priesthood with dignity,  have the cause of God fully at heart, labor faithfully for its promotion while the day lasts,  for night will soon come when no man can work. We should practice virtue and holiness  before the Lord, and shun the very appearance of evil. We should enter our closets, and  call upon God for wisdom to direct us in every duty in life. Our object should be to  preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to this generation, and present those principles that will save the souls of men.  If there is any man in this church that does wrong, that breaks the law of God, it mat- tereth not what his standing may be, whether among the Twelve, the High Priests, Seven- ties, or Elders, or in any other standing, there is a tribunal that will reach their case in process of time, there is authority before whom they can be tried. Therefore let no one  turn against the cause of God, and stop in the road to destruction, on the plea that some- body has done wrong: it is no excuse for you or I to do wrong because another does:  the soul that sins, alone must bear it. Should I step aside from the path of duty it would  not destroy the gospel of Jesus Christ, or even one principle of eternal truth, they would  remain the same. Neither would it be any excuse for you to commit sin! but I should have to bear my own sins, and not the sins of othersâ€”so with all men.  Therefore, let me exhort all ye elders of Israel and saints of God to rise up in the ma- jesty and dignity of your calling, make full proof of your ministry and covenant. Sustain  by your works the authorities, keys, and priesthood, of God in all its bearings and appen- dages, through this last dispensation, for the eyes of God, angels and men, are over you, and when the work is finished, you will receive your just recompence of reward.

Your bro. in the Gospel  A. Carrington Young. ENDENTRY To Wilford Woodruff and the first presidency of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints  Salt Lake City December 1896  Dear brethren,  As every man that mostly works for day's wages, so am I glad for your action to change the Fast day to the weekly day of worship.  Yet I do not feel satisfied in one point, inasmuch as you say that we shall bear testimony to each other, for that seems to contradict recent teachings on that subject: It is two years last Summer that apostle Grantsville gave us the following instructions:  That the Fast day meeting is not for preaching  nor is it a testimony-meeting, but it is essentially for praying and confessing our sins before the saints.  I also heard him repeat this instruction at the next following general conference of the church, and I accepted his word as the Lord's and have sought to obey it, and He also has heard my prayers. It was also given to me to  conceive how the other part of this teaching, if carried out, would soon develop in a beautiful feature of our fast meetings, wich might relieve them of the dullness, that is creeping upon them. An hour spent in self-review  among brethren, what a blessing that might prove for those that partake in it!  But one lone voice would not make a meeting of that kind and one that might attempt to break the ice by opening his heart before his brethren, would feel chilled and close up upon himself again, if there was no response to his sentiments. In other words, unless the meetings should be conducted accordingly, one individual alone would hardly dare to enter this field wich is an unknown country to most of us.  And I am sorry to state that in my wanderings in these 2 years I have not seen nor heard of any move in this direction and now your ruling seems to dispense altogether with the necessity to do so.

ENDENTRY It is now the question with me: Is this an oversight on your part or are there any reasons for making the advice of bro. Lyman invalid? If not and if we simply do not mind the one advice, is there any guarantee that we will mind the other, though given by a higher authority?  The chances are, we will not do it, but carry out on the Fastday the usual program of a testimony meeting,  that is: after the meeting is given in the hands of the saints,  some glibly tongued Elder will get up and â€” "for fear of the time going to waste" â€” fill it out by loading us down with enough precepts to go on for the rest of our lives, of  wich however we will not be more mindful, than he is himself of what is becoming in a meeting.  Not that this testimony-preaching has been without any results whatever: It has hushed the voice of our sisters and minor members in our testimony-meetings. they now always tell us, if we try at home to induce them to bear their testimony: "Oh! I am not a preacher!"  Preaching, then, has come to be considered as the main thing in our worship. But I sometimes wonder if the Lord would not be as well pleased, if we pushed the bigger part of it over board and put some more music in its place. At least He says that He likes to hear the songs of the saints, also their prayers, but I have not found yet where He says that much about preaching without commission.  Now my brethren I hope you will not take this letter as an evidence of faultfinding, for I can tell you,  although I believe you to be human and therefore liable to make an occassional mistake, that I have full confidence in you, enough for instance, that for my part I would gladly have been left without the discloures â€” however interesting â€” of the last conference as I never before thought this case to be any of our business.  But this is a question that confronts me directly  while trying to carry out the will of the Lord as revealed by His Servants and others may be in the same condition.  We may therefore look forth for an enlightemnent in some shape from your source.  In the meantime I remain, with especial respect Your brother Albert Kropfli  sideways text Alfred Kropfl Dec. 1896.

As to joining your church myself, dear Sirs, you may be firmly assured that it is not the question of faith, which keeps me away from you but simply the full know- ledge that with the circumstances in these parts lying as they are anyone engaged for socialism is so much engaged in the political questions that, taking the care for existence into the bargain, it would be simply mental sui- cide to bother about religion.

Just these however are the thing, we aim to get the knowledge of. So f. e. for example it is told in one that you were driven out of Missouri on HC. of deprecations committed by your people, because you had robbed property, cattle, etc. I even know a novelF going as far as ascribing to you the robbing of women for immoral purposes. Now that all this is nonsense is sure, nevertheless it is written again and again, though mere meditation might teach anyone that even now and much less at these times any^no^thing could be robbed from a farmer except perhaps a cow or a horse, and of these your people had plenty as the same writer says your people were in well off circumstance. The balances tip much more to the contrary, that the igno- rant populace got incited to rob your stores etc and that their religious ire was incensed by the avarice and not at all by any divine or any other reason.

Now, dear Sirs, I beg to approach you with the following request. Leaving all religous questions aside your prophet Josef Smith tried in his way to solve the social problems of his time and as far as the little knowledge goes, which I could gather about these facts, (very little known here) I reckon he has solved it about it in the best manner possible for his time and your church has done the best it could to keep in his tracks. That you couldnot keep out of the encroachments of capitalism is something inevitable and your history of the last 20 years at least was less one of religious strive strife, but of the agressments of outsiders trying to destroy your institutions more than your religion, which in the main would leave them cold.  To get fully acquainted with all these matters referring to the social institutions of your church from its earliest time has now been my chief desire since long time, and I beg to address myself to you, asking you to kindly furnish my with the necessary details.

Dear Brethren:  Having secured the agency for the Graph- ophone and other talking machines, for Utah, the idea is presented to my mind that it would be very valuable to the rising generation if we could record on special cylinders the tesytimonyies of yourselves and other leading Brethren, so that with your own voices you might speak to those who have not the privilege of hearing you now in person, but who would be edified and strengthened by your testimonies in the future. Partic- ularly am I desirous of securing that of President Woodruff. How valuable his testionmony would be in years to come, is apparent when we consider that the testimony of the Prophet Joesph and  those of the other Presidents of the Church who have passed away, would give us untold pleasure, if we could hear them now.  They would be priceless, and the benefit to be derived from hearing their testimonies of the truth, by those who never saw these great men, would be beyond ^present^ conception. I have some  excellent machoines, and would like the privilege of an interview with you, when I would bring one and you could speak into it. I would supply one copy of each record for the Hoistorian's  Office, for preservation, and only ask the privilege of keeping  others like them for my own use.

Dear Brethren  I have had it in mind for some time to enter a home- stead. As this is a step which would com- promise me for 5 years at least, and as I feel it might involve a loss, or prevent me from doing something else my maker might desire me to do, I  thought it prudent to seek counsel before doing so.  The land I had thought to enter as a homestead is situated in the N. W. corner of Kane County about 30 miles ^East^ of Cedar city; is in the high mts on the headwaters of the Rio Virgen River.  It may be irrelevant to give you  the locality of the land; as the two points on which I have doubts as to whether it would  be right, and causes me to doubt the wisdom of my intentions are:  1st Would it be right to isolate myself and part of my family, at least half my time for 5 years from any organized ward where I could attend meetings or assist as a help to the Priesthood?  2 Would my assistance be wanted in the next 5 years in the missionary field or elsewhere wherein I would be handicapped by homesteading?  I would greatly appreciate a few  words of counsel sometime during the winter if not too great an intrusion on your valuable time. Your Bro. David. F. Stout  sideways text If bro. Stout feels that the land should be secured, and it is a proper and reasonable investment for his future welfare, I think he should be a perfect liberty to enter the same. And should his services be needed, in the mean time, kind providence will open his way. Let him do what he thinks proper and good for himself and family in the matter, with approval of the local authorities. Jospeh Fielding Smith|J. F. S. end of sideways text ENDENTRY D. W.
