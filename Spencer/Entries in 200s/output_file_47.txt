 JAMES R. READ,  1315 Mulberry St.,  BALTIMORE, MD.    July 31st, 1890.    Hon. Wilton Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Sir:    The object of this letter is to inquire if in the service  of the Church or in your own individual service there is a position  vacant which you wish to fill with a man on whose ability, fideli-  ty, courage and integrity you can always rely?  If so, to respect-  fully request that you consider me an applicant. If there is not  any way which I can serve you here, I shall be pleased to come to  Salt Lake City or to go to any place which you may direct.    I am a young man, 27 years old; have been a student at the  Johns Hopkins University, and am a graduate of the Law Dept. of the   University of Maryland.    I am at present employed, but my position is in many ways not  congeniel, but being dependent upon it and having a mother to look  after, has in a great measure precluded me from securing another  situation more suited to my taste.    In the event of employing me, there is no doubt but that you  will find me valuable to you. I do not say this is the spirit of  conceit, but because I know that a man of any ability, who is an  honorable man, as I trust I am; and who will be as loyal to your  interests as I shall be, is always a valuable man.    If you decide to give me a trial, I shall give you satisfacto-  ry reference as to my character, mental qualifications &c.    I solicit your careful consideration for the above, and am sat-  isfied if you decide to take me into your service that you will not  regret having done so.    Yours very respectfully,    James R Read.  1315 Mulberry St. 
 it with you, if you think  i aught to go i will do  my very best to get ready  please answer    your Brother in the Gospel  Ole Larsen    I would say to him that  he can remain at home  until he has arranged  his affairs and is  freely prepared to go.  J. F. S.

 President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother: It is not  conscerning the Baby Reserection, nei  ther do I wish to dictate to the Leaders  of the Church that I write this Letter,  tis only to state what Father has  done for me personaly, and I want  it on Record that the came can be re  ferd to if needid. Now, I Testafy Father  has done this. Place it  on Record.    As Prophesying is not Popular  in this Generation, like the Barren  D. Cab, who fell at the Battle of Camden  in the Revolution War. I will simply  reckon Chikins before hatched, and  say, all Isreal would be Justafied  before the Heaven in haveing a Gen  eral Jubilee and much Rejoiceing  next year, for 1890 brings in the ful-  ness of the Gentiles. This I am sure of as  I am of the Redemption of Zion. 
 San Francisco May 28th 1890    Thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Wilford  Woodruff: Behold I send a messenger unto you who will  prophesy unto you as Marian did unto the children  of Israel. She is a prophetess of God, and will prophesy  to my people truths that will gladden their souls.    Receive her with thanksgiving and praise unto me,  for great things are coming unto my people here in  Utah. Great changes are coming to them, for the Lord  will now comfort Zion and bring joy and gladness  unto her sorrowing ones. The prayers of my people  have come up unto me, and I come down with  power and glory to answer those prayers. To bring  deliverance unto the captives, and to bless the servants  who hold my priesthood. They too shall be blessed with  the baptism of the Holy Ghost from on high quickening  their perceptions to teach my people aright; for ye are  my chosen people whom I have brought through great  tribulation to this desert land and you have caused it  to blossom as the rose, through great suffering, diligence,  and patience in well doing, which is pleasing in my  sight.    This messenger that I send unto you is a chosen

It came to me, I did not run after  it, for the time had come.    At a remote Period, when the  Great Interior Salt Lake washed the Base  of the Mountains as the water mark shows  and the mouths of the Rivers were miles  back in the mountains. A Jentle slope or  Enoline was from the mountains (Bottom  of Lake) to the Inteiror or Level, there  was no Sand Reefs or other Impediment  to hinder the wash from the Mountains  to seek a Level, perhapse Clayhard Pan  Hence, all heavy substance would  naturaly recede from the mountains.

 Jos. S. Horne  29 March [18]92.    Richfield, Mar. 29th 1892.    Prest. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City.    Dear Bro:    Among other Brethren who have  lately received calls to go on mis-  sions, is Frederick Beutler Jr. of  this Ward. He cannot correspond  very well in English so I promised  to write for him.    His financial circumstances  are such that he cannot arrange  to go just now, nor would I deem  it wise to urge him to go at present.  While I am not desirous to place  obstacles in the way of any one's  progress, it seems consistent that   men who go abroad should harm-  onize their actions and words, thus  being effectual dispensers of the Gospel.

 Of course Bro. Beutler feels  the responsibility of such a call,  at least he seems to, and if he  is not required to go on a mission  he would like to know that he is  excused.    I have wondered who forwarded  his name, but have not learned   as yet.    The foregoing is not written  because of any unpleasantness be-  teen Bro. B. and myself, nor yet  trouble he now has with others.    Hhoping this is sufficient I am    Your Brother in the Gospel,    Jos. L. Horne.    This seems to be very unfavorable  to bro. F. Beutler's going on a  mission, until he cleans up  some things. Unless he is all  right, let him be dropped.  J. F. S.

Full instructions have been  sent to S. & G. Scandenavian &  Holland Missions and we shall  try to post our conference presi-  dents on these subjects. The return-  ing brethren and immigrants  are instructed in the manner in  which they should conduct themselves  All immigrant tickets and lists  of same held by the purser of the  vessel ^must^ show where they are from  and the name of town & state  of destination. We can put  Ogden, Utah. U. S. A. as the  least likely to carry convictions  to the enemy that "Mormons" are  landing in U. S. Ogden being  the termi of several roads it  may be supposed that the emi-  grant is going to Cal., Oregon, Mon. or  Idaho. However we shall canvas  the matter more closely, than we have  yet done.

 I came near sending my son Jos.  A. to Turkey but found it would  seriously interrupt his study of the  German language. He is stationed  in Berlin now, and he asked the   privilege of going to the university  for a year to perfect him^self^ in the lan-  guage. I consented on the ground  that he would complete his miss-  ion after the year was ended. There  was no time to ask your advice ^for the university opened in a few days.^ &  I took this liberty, for another reason  he represented that he believed a new  opening to preach the gospel ^among the students^ could  be made and he strenuously advo-  cated giving the educated classes  a chance. I have thought he could  finish his mission in Turkey provid-  ing it met your mind. However that  can be considered in its time.    Immigration companies are going of-  ten now. Nearly every saturday we  shall have more or less going out.    We find the sterage is not nearly  so comfortable on the Alaska  and Arizona, as it is on the other  three vessels of the Guion line.    I leave for Copenhagen tomor-  row morning.
