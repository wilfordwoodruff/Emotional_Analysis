Wilfred Woodruff, President of the Church of  Jesus Christ of the Latter- Day Saints.  Dear Sir:  Regretting my inability to  see you when I called yester- day, I take the liberty of  addressing you this note  which will explain the pur- pose of my visit. The San  Francisco Examiner, which  I have the honor to repre- sent, will publish about  February 1st next, a special- edition to be known as the  Midwinter Fair edition, which  will be devoted to the in- terests of the Western states and territories. This paper will be the best newspaper  ever published in America. ENDENTRY THANKSGIVING AND PRAYER.  To the Latter-day Saints in Zion and  throughout the world:  Beloved Brethren and Sisters—A little over two years ago we were im- pressed to call upon the Latter-day  Saints to set apart a day for fasting and solemn prayer unto the Lord. Our position at that time was such  that it seemed as though no earthly power could deliver us from the evil which environed us and which threat- ened our overthrow. Turn which way we would, every avenue seemed closed against us. Human help was be- yond our reach. Our eyes and hearts under those circumstances, turned to  the Lord as the only power to which we could appeal for succor. Do we say too much when we testify that the Lord did on that occasion condescend  to hear and answer the supplication of His people.  Their humiliation before Him was not without its fruits. If the objects which were suggested in our circular letter at that time to be prayed for be examined, the results will show how wonderfully the Lord has granted the  prayers of His people?  In view of this, and the great mercy shown unto us by our Father in  heaven in permitting us, at our recent General Conference, to lay the top stone of the Salt Lake Temple with shouts of Hosanna to God and the  Lamb, it has suggested itself to us that  it would be most appropriate for the Latter-day Saints to gather in their various places of worship, on Sunday the first day of May, 1892, and in fast- ing and prayer, offer up to the Most High their heartfelt and solemn thanksgivings for His goodness and mercy, which He has shown unto them and the deliverance that He has wrought out in their behalf.  Surely, no people have greater cause for thanksgiving and praise than have  the Latter-day Saints throughout these mountains. And as we cannot have  occasion for thanksgiving because of  deliverance wrought our for us, with- out our brethren and sisters in other lands sharing in our joy, it is proper that they, too, should select a day, as may be suitable and convenient to them, in like manner to fast and pray and offer up their gratitude and thanks to the Great Creator for the blessings He has bestowed upon His people.  We have decided to select Sunday for this purpose, because it can meet with a more general observance on the part of all the people than would be  possible upon any other day.  Every man, woman and child be- longing to our Church should join in this glad service, for, although we have many obstaclcs to con- tend with, and the adversary of our souls has not made truce, nor laid down his arms, yet the Lord has spoiled many nf his schemes, and des- troyed his snares, and has provided for us a way of escape from his power.  In our prayers we should still sup- plicate the Almighty Father to con- tinue to bless and deliver His Zion, and to prepare the way for the ushering in of the full reign of righteousness and truth, when He whose right it is to reign shall hold undisputed sway over all the earth.  The following resolution was unani- mously adopted by the immense as- semblage of people at the laying of the  top-stone of the Temple:  Believing that the instruction of  President Woodruff, respecting the early completion of the Salt Lake Temple, is the word of the Lord to us, I propose that this assemblage pledge themselves, collectively and individu- ally, to furnish, as fast as it may be needed, all the money that may be re- quired to complete the Temple at the  earliest time possible, so that the dedi- cation may take place on April 6th, 1893.  Plans have been suggested for the collection of the funds needed to com plete the Temple in accordance with this resolution: but we have decided that no better occasion could offer for this purpose than the time when the Saints shall be assembled to ob- serve this day of prayer and thanks- giving. Subscriptions can then be taken by the various Bishops and other presiding officers from all who are present at the meetings; and if all are not prepared to give that which they  desire to subscribe at the time, they can make their arrangements to pay by installments.  It is very desirable that this labor should be completed so that the sacred building can be dedicated to the Lord at the General Conference, April 6th, 1893. Steps have already been taken to have the work done, with the full expectation that the funds which were voted for when this reso- lution was adopted will be forthcoming in time to meet all the payments. We  feel assured there will be no disap- pointment in this, if the Bishops and other presiding authorities do their  duty.  There is no labor in which the Lat- ter-day Saints feel more deeply inter- ested than in the building and com- pleting of Temples.  This Temple at Salt Lake City has long been in process of erection. By the 6th of April next, forty years will have elapsed since the laying of the founda- tion stones. It seems proper, then, that the expiration of that period should wit- ness its dedication. We trust that no exertions will be spared to accomplish this end, and that all will respond lib- erally to the call which will be made upon them.  Praying the Lord to bestow upon all the Latter-day Saints upon this occa- sion the spirit of prayer and thanks- giving, we remain,  Your Brethren,  WILFORD WOODRUFF, GEO. Q. CANNON, JOSEPH F.

Prest Woodruff and Brethren of the Presidency.  Dear Brethren:  The difficulties which now beset the  inauguration of the business I represent vary very considera- bly from the physical difficulties which have been met and  overcome, and for help have come them I now earnestly appeal to you. I readily recognize, and I feel keenly, the difference in  the circumstances of the true friends of the people before and  after the commencement of the "Grand Steal". Heretofore the establishment of an industrial enterprise for the benefit of  our people has been much more easily reached than it can possibly be at the present time, because, with the will the people's best friends had the means to assist with the lubricating element of money as well as influence and friendship. Now money is out of the question but influence and friendship and the power to use them remain.  The element which has brought about this important change has dammed up the source and turned the channels and cur- rents of fertilizing means from where they could be used for prac- tical benefits, into courses barren of good results, and have these partially paralysed the hand of material assistance, and now to  keep as much as possible absolute control out of the hands of iminical and paralysing power seems to be the great desideratum; to do this I appeal to you for your help and counsel. ENDENTRY There is no longer question with regard to the profitableness of the busi- ness I represent; the profits, to say the least of them, will be very considerable from the beginning and the business properly managed will assume magnificent proportions, and in a few years those who control it will be in the front ranks of our finiancial world. Wise manipulation, prudent counsel, and competent assistance right now will in all probability secure this control. He who feels interested for the welfare of this people would feel very much chagrined, to have levied upon them, when employed profitably and remuneratively in this business, a monthly tribute for the support of the "loyal league" or to see them superseded by Chinamen, or worse the lowlived tramps and apostates who are enlisted in the Devil's forces, or to have this magnificent financial power wielded for the crushing out of the last vestige of  freedom and liberty left to us. God has not only prepared and preserved but he has given to us this country; He has blessed the  soil, increased the water, made the elements conducive to fertility, withheld the frost, advanced the seasons, and made this portion of his creation ^beautiful and enviable, and^, at our solicitation and to gratify our pleasure, and to make our homes pleasant and desirable He has given us the wisdom and the  energy to develop the resources of our mountain land. Shall we  easily and without consideration and effort allow any portion of the  control of these choice blessings to pass out of our possession?  The business I represent grapples with the outspending of one and a half millions a year; it means the employment of over a thousand hands, and the manipulation of the vast wealth that will inevitably accumulate around this nucleus. Shall our people control this and have the power to employ God's people ENDENTRY Salt Lake City Mar 13 1890  Presidents Woodruff Smith  Dear Brethren  I have the honor of informing you that the Sugar County bill  passed and the Governor signed it at  10 last Evening.

The kindly assistance of your consideration, counsel and influence will secure this control; by your active advice and friendship for this enterprise, the Cooperative stores and brethren who have money and lack only a little inspiriting influence to give them the fortitude to embark some of their means in so worthy and  profitable an enterprise, a preponderance at least of mormon capital can be secured. It is probably neither desirable nor possi- ble to entirely exclude outside capital but to keep it in the minority  is the object to be attained, and to hold the reins of power now is the time for consideration and forethought and to plan to retain that which will be a great blessing to keep and it appears to me  would be a misfortune, if not actually a sin, on our part, to lose.  Your kind sympathy with the enterprise, your desire for its success, your counsel concerning the course to pursue, and  general fostering interest for ^in^ its development, will be invalua- ble factors in its prosperity and securing its control, and are  most earnestly and respectfully solicited.

Presidents Woodruff, Smith:  Dear Brethren:  Permit me to respectfully lay before you the following reflec- tions upon the result of my interview yesterday:  It is now nearly nine years since I first conceived the idea of building up the Sugar industry in Utah.  Faithfully, ploddingly and patiently I have centralized my efforts upon that one object and have allowed nothing to stand in the way of its accomplishment.  No sacrifice has been too great, no jeopardy too venturesome, no reasonable consideration too precious to reach the desired end.  Everything I possessed or could control, savings, earnings, credit, comfort, pleasure, home itself have been placed upon the altar and immolated like Palissy's furniture to reach the blessing proposed.  If I had failed and wasted my time and labor on an unprofitable under- taking fruitless of profitable result I would be willing to accept the reward of a fool should have, but with all the benefits, social, political and financial which belong to the business I have labored in plainly in sight, I may be forgiven if my heart is heavy with disappointment at the result of the interview yesterday.  Let the intense interest I feel in this matter plead excuse for me in asking respectfully this question; Are there not some means of reaching a subscrip- tion of $3000 -- being $1000 each and paying 10% thereof, to manifest for this enterprise a recognition by the Presidency of this.

Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother:  Very respectfully I submit the following:  I have the opportunity of purchasing certain lands on the Provo Bench, (the point which I have selected as the most suitable to establish the first plantation and factory for sugar) surrounding, or contiguous to, two sections of  University lands, costing something less than $15000$— an average of $1700 per acre; also of purchasing for $10,000 the water right of the Provo Woollen Mills, sufficient to  irrigate 5000 acres. By purchasing this land I can secure the two sections of University land. An Eastern party is trying to secure these very lands in order to introduce a colony of strangers upon that very section of country.  With a little help from you I can secure this location. The brethren who have promised money on the Sugar industry will keep their promises ENDENTRY if they can see that you are willing to sustain the enterprise, And sufficient money will be forthcoming to carry the business successfully on if I can get the first step taken aright.  You have assisted banking, merchandising, and  wagon setting firms with your potential influence, and  the principle of production modestly asks for your sanction and support. Respectfully I urge that the Sugar industry is second to none in importance, in profit, in practicability, in power and in influence. In 6 years after commencement it will empty 1000 hands, and its output of production be ($1000,000$) a million dollars annually. It will employ 10,000 acres of land and 10 factories. If we are to stay here, is this not a matter of importance to secure? Will it not be a cement under our feet,? will it not fasten the hearts and interests of people here, establish firmly their homes and if we secure the control will not the people employed be friends and not enemies?  A small subscription from you with the moral support of the name of some of the leading brethren on the Directory will secure these things.  It is now too late to plant for this season, but there is yet time to secure the land and water in question and the prospective benefits of the magnificent industry.

If we do not do it some- body else will just as the Provo bench and university lands will be secured by strangers if we do not secure it right now.  Your sanction and approval and influence with a few thousand dollars will do this. I find that those who promised support hang on your action to a great extent, and much difficulty will arise, and consequent delay if your favorable action is delayed, but if you grant it every thing is planned and ready for immediate action. We can plow up the land ready for next year, build the houses and stables, plant lucern fields, make the water ditches and secure the success of the undertaking, all with about $30,000$ which I know I can get as fast  as I want it. I am offered one quarter section of  the land and three thousand dollars worth of teams or stock just as soon as I get started. ENDENTRY With these interests at stake and consequent anxiety I  feel that you will excuse my apparent importunity, which  may have appeared unseemly. The first year's profits of  $40,000 have passed away, it is too late now to think of them, but mby moving now what I have stated can be secured.  The party intending or trying to purchase the Provo Bench has gone to Colorado and will return next week, he says with the money, therefore I respectfully ask your early  and favorable action hereon.

I have secured many good friends to the industry who are ready to show their confidence by their payments, but it is me that some of the men who have become rich here and claim to be financiers have not as yet yielded their tangible sympathy and interest to the enterprise. They  claim, by virtue of their success no matter by what methods  produced, the right to stand aloof and look supercili- ously down, from their supposed point of vantage, upon the labours and propositions of other men and they claim the right of judging other men's capabilities by standards of their own raising, and I have proved that they are not above the abject meanness of wresting from a temporarily exhausted workesr the benefit of his labour and using the develop- ment which is the result of his exertion without due and proper ENDENTRY Nov 19 1889 A Stayner.

One of these branches is the producing and man- ufacturing, the other one is the trading and speculative. A very little experience and reflection will enable one to de- termine the relative qualifications requisite for the represen- tatives of the two branches. While each should possess energy and vim, and be thoroughly imbued with the spirit of his work, the one may be of slower thought and tempera- ment than the other but must possess that dogged per- severance and invincible pertinacity of purpose that knows no surrender; he must also possess to a marked degree the virtue of patience which will enable him to watch the slow developing of experiment and which, if he does not reach success at one trial, will inspire him to look forward ENDENTRY payment therefor, and they presume to set up their indepen- dent ladders on the platforms he has raised in order to pluck the fruit which he has planted, when it ripens. They presume to interpret my temporarily exhausted condition into ^lack of^ capacity because they do not comprehend the self devotion which inspires one to spend his last dollar and jeopardise his every interest to produce other than the most selfish results. There is no more justice in this course than in the attitude of the United States in robbing this people of their property, and I appeal to the highest authority God has on the Earth for protection against the possibility of anything  like such an outrage.  The words of one of the brethren addressed to Bro Morris and  myself a few weeks ago are ringing in my ears because they so truly re-echo the sentiments of my heart, "Is it possible that we cannot do anything for the benefit of the people without the Bank corner"? My sympathy with this sentiment has rendered me somewhat indifferent about courting their influence. While I do not desire to antagonize them I am not willing to bow, just because they have got money, to men who have no higher concep- tion of a business than the sordid consideration of how much money there is in it for themselves.  It is a generally received axiom that to appreciate the ENDENTRY hopefully through a whole year awaiting an opportunity to try again; and this in contradistinction to the more mer- curial disposition of the other, who, in the fever of excitement, is often too restless and impatient to wait longer than overnight to realize the execution and fruition of his plans. This latter character before he will take the trouble to examine into a producing or manufacturing, requires that it shall be led out before him all perfect and bedecked with ribbons like a prize beast at a fair, while the other character is willing to breed the calf, then tend it, nurture it and watch it until it attains a condition of perfection worthy to compete for the judges' award. The one party is willing to take some risk of obtaining possible or probable benefits to be developed by time, the other takes as little risk as possible and wants to get a hold on two thirds of his neighbour's jack-knife, while he gives a hold on only one third of his own.  While both branches are indispensable and honora- ble the one, that of production and manufacture, is suscepti- ble of much greater good to a community than the other. The same amount of capital will retain a much larger amount of money for circulation and will give a much greater percentage of employment, and by the its excess ENDENTRY beauty and sublinity of poetry is the very next akin to being the poet who produces them, so it may well be said that to appreciate the labours of self sacrifice is to be the possessor of the self devotion necessary to its accomplishment. Upon hearts unable to appreciate, the devoted labours of a lifetime fall as down upon adamant, and the recognition of such a life, be it rewarded or unrequited, depends upon the honor and sensitiveness of the community who are the beneficiaries of the work.  I appeal to you, brethren, for further, and I trust more favorable, consideration for I lay this matter at your feet as the servants of God nearest to Him, and I illegible ^hesitate^ to take it up again unless blessed and imbued with your respect and influence.  Very respectfully submitted by your brother in the Gospel Arthur Stayner  P.S.

An illustration of this principle is seen by analyzing and comparing Z.C.M.I., one of the noblest and praiseworthy institutions of the trading branch, with some of the manufacturing estab- lishments in our community.  ZCMI with a capital of one million dollars sells 3¼ million of goods a year; of this amount there is kept here for circulation $200,000 wfor wages, $100,000 for dividend and probably $50,000 more for reserve fund, in all say $350,000, the remainder, nearly three millions, is shovelled out of the Territory just as fast and as completely as it can possibly be done; this money goes to pay operatives 2000 or 3000 miles away for doing things, many of which some of our unemployed people, if properly organized, could, and would be glad to, do; and with this capital this Institution employs only one hand to each $8000, pays out wages equal to only 20% and earns including reserve fund 15%, while the shoeshop and tannery occupying only one eighth as much capital, saves for circulation one half as much money, pays out for wages an amount equal to 50% of its capital and employs two hands to the $1000 or sixteen times as many hands as ZCMI does to the same amount of capital; yet ENDENTRY June 15 1889 Arthur Stayner City.

Thus it can be seen that ZCMI, with its one manufacturing offspring occupying only one eighth of its capital, is doing nearly as much good to the community as it is doing with the other seven eighths in the mercantile department, and it is a matter worthy of notice and germain to my argument that this one issue together with a small branch for making overalls and jumpers is the only manufacturing development ^of Z.C.M.I^ in twenty years of its existence, and it can be safely averred that it would not now exist but for the intelligent perseverance of Wm H. Lowe. I mention this and call particular attention to it to show that the class of men necessary to manage successfully a mercantile institution like ZCMI, cannot be expected to evolve from the crude elements the productions upon  which depend the employment of labour and the true prosperity and tangible wealth of the people.  A striking illustration of the principle I wish to substantiate is found in the incorporation of the Utah Commercial Bank last week. Capital to the amount of $200,000 was subscribed at short notice for this undertaking, but what benefit will it be to the people? That $200,000 will employ not to exceed ENDENTRY five or six persons or one hand to $35000 or $40000, which means that the shoe shop industry will employ 70 to 80 times as many hands as this Bank will to the same amount of Capital, and is it not a reasonable surmise that while the spirit of Banking and kindred speculations prevails there will be plenty of money to advance the interests of the few, yetbut it looks as though the Devil may have the many. That banks are, as animated safes, necessary and convenient insti- tutions is conceded but from what source do they make their money? They produce nothing, they manufacture nothing, but they simply take their profits from other people's earnings, by lending A's money to B and keeping the interest that B pays for the use of it.  It is indispensable that such institutions as ZcmI and some other kindred financial concerns should exist, and that they are represented and manipulated by men of noble probity and marked intelligence is a source of congratulation to the community, but that they exist in so notable a prepon- derance over the producing and manufacturing branch of the financial power is a palpable evidence of faulty utilization of the principles of political and domestic economy.  There can exist no reasonable doubt in the mind of any statesman, having the true interests of his people in view, that there is great superiority in the beneficent policy of  ENDENTRY Arthur Stayner 24 Sept. 1890. ENDENTRY legislating and planning for the benefit of the many, while preserving and protecting the rights of the few.  A clearcut and palpable evidence substantiating the proposition I have laid down with regard to the difference of talent and qualification necessary for the two separate branches is found in the statement made by one of the committeemen to whom had been entrusted investigation into the merits of the sugar industry, when he said "I cannot grasp the details of a producing or manufacturing business but if you will make your sugar I will buy it and sell it." This expression showing the absence of interest in or comprehension of anything pertaining to the producing interests seemed to voice the sentiments of the whole committee and gave tone to their report which recommended a disastrous delay, whereas a few drops of the vivifying elixir, without which production and manufacture would ever be a failure, would have inspired a searching inquiry, elicited attract- ive information, and engendered an interest that would have culminated in a thorough investigation and given us the fruition of the enterprise some time earlier.  How true it is that the safe conservatisue that declines to move lest it fail is the dry-rot of life.  It certainly should be readily conceded that one of the most valuable aids to the solid and tangible pros- ENDENTRY OFFICE OF THE UTAH SUGAR CO., P.O. BOX 499. Secretary's Department.

The digest of their report is briefly as follows: The beetsugar Factory Alvarado Cal. cost $190,000 makes sugar 3 9/10 and per lb profit 25% The beetsugar Factory Watsonville Cal.  $475,000 makes sugar 4 1/8 per lb profit 19% The Sorghum sugar Factory Fortscott Kansas    $72,000 makes sugar 5 1/2 per lb profit nothing  We found the California Factories running on very rich beets, the result of drouth being small crop but rich in sugar. We found the Fort Scott Factory running on very poor cane the result of a cold, wet, backward spring which caused replant- ing and immature cane.  They are making a smaller output this year than I used to make with my old milling  and open process, and only little more than one half  of what they got last year for the whole season's average.  Consequently as the beet manufacture is so much of a  success, and the results elicited at our late Fair are so satisfactory with regard to the saccharine in our beets, it is not worth while to argue for the Sorghume although it can be plainly shown that the conditions, climate, market, and protection by freight are so much more ENDENTRY perity of a community is the motive that inspires one not only to run some risk but to be willing to make some sacrifice for the development of the crude resources of the country, and the evolution of industries in which great prospective good lies dormant. In the introduction of all new producing and manufacturing enterprises, no matter how skilfully managed nor what prestige they may bear upon their front, there is a feature of adventure or apparent risk which calls for nerve and good judgment and staying qualities born of determined motive. Between the inception and the consummation of any enterprise designed for the transformation of the crude elements into the practical and material necessaries and comforts of life, there exists a hiatus, in the bridging of which many a valuable and well-intentioned design dies the death of inanition, so many there are who use just enough fuel to make the water hot but withhold the last few bushels of coal necessary to raise the steam to a working pressure.

But I am satisfied with the showing of the beet question, and am assured by experts that our beets although they may contain an excess of inimicable properties, they are of the same kinds as are found in the beets of other countries and need only a little severed treatment of the same nature as that used in other countries.  Foreseeing them that the business will meet with favor here, and already knowing that your sentiments are anxious to indorse whatever is proved to be practicable and reasonably assured of profitable success, I am very anxious to have every measure adopted that will assist in making the enterprise firmly founded.  In this view I, recognizing the value of Bro Howes' judgment and skill in Machinery, asked him if he would be willing to accom- pany me to Europe for the purpose of visting some of the latest improved Factories and machinery with the view to select that best suited to our conditions and to procure working drawings there of and either procure the same in whole or in part in Europe or place an order with American Manufacturers;  Bro Howe replied, as he  ENDENTRY failure.  The industry which it is my earnest desire to inaugurate amongst this people possesses all the salient points of a successful and attractive home industry, and the slowness of its development is not due to its inherent weakness but to the fact that the recognition of its merits has been submitted to men belonging to the trading and speculative branch whose indifferent and hypercritical gaze, lacking the warmth of sympathy and congeniality has chilled and temporally retarded its growth and forced it into the more safe but slower process of making root instead of top. There is not however the least shadow of doubt on my mind that the industry will be satisfac- torily, permanently, and profitably established and all the benefits claimed for it will be realized and it will become the head and front and most potent factor of the producing and manufacturing branch of the financial power  Very respectfully submitted Arthur Stayner ENDENTRY OFFICE OF THE UTAH SUGAR CO., P.O.

I do not want the responsibility of selecting the kind of machinery therefore desire Bro Howes' assistance.  Although I wish to go down to Europe and work a month or two in the Laboratory and ^in fact^ in the whole Factory of one of their First class establishments it is in order that I may be thoroughly competent to have control, but I advocate the employment of thoroughly experienced and skilled superintendency inside the Factory, so as to place the contingency of success beyond a reasonable doubt.  I would make every provision for the elements of prosperity at the first and future successes will inevitably accrue.  If you, Brethren, upon whose influence so much of  this enterprise depends, feel like inviting Bro Howe to do as above it will be a matter of great importance and largely conducive to our prosperity.

President Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother:  Your very kind and prompt reply to my  question was duly received on Friday afternoon, and I thank you  gratefully, for the kind expressions of concern which your letter  conveys. In the presence of so many implied doubts on the part of  my friends, it would appear self-willed and, perhaps, foolishly head- strong, on my part, to persist in an undertaking of so great conse- quence and magnitude, as the one concerning which I have written you. May I not intrude upon your time to lay before you, in brief,  some of the palpable reasons which have induced me to undertake  so great a labor?  I commenced, nearly eight years ago, to search for some business  of production that would relieve the over-burdened ranks of the  Farmers, and occupy their attention in some direction wherein they  would cease to compete against each other in the production of  Wheat. I saw that ranks of the farmers were over-burdened with the  number of persons who did not legitimately belong there. Many  thousands of Tradesmen of various kinds had come here to live. They  could not find the employment which had hbeen their means of support  up to the time of leaving the Old Countries; and, rather than accept  ENDENTRY OFFICE OF  THE UTAH SUGAR CO., P. O.

The farming business opened up the most ready access to supply  their needs; and they thus, measurably ignorant of the business, be- came competitors against the legitimate farmers. Their lack of  skill obliged them to raise the crop most easily produced,—Wheat; and their necessities compelled them to be the first in the market with what they had to sell. Thus, the legitimate farmer was power- less in maintaining reasonable and paying prices for his product. And, so long as there was an excess of supply over demand, prices  ruled low and no one was well paid. Hence the necessity of opening  up some other branch of the industry upon which the farming labor  might be employed; in addition to this reason, there also appeared a still greater one: that a large number of our people are unem- ployed; that is, failed in securing continuous employment; and while many were not profitably employed, many others were not employed at  all, and many of our young men, who, failing to find work at home, are  forced to look for employment in Mining Camps and other places  away from the care of parents.  In looking about, then, for a channel into which to direct the  labors of the farming community and others unemployed, I noticed  that we paid out annually a very vast sum for the article of Sugar, ENDENTRY Sept 4 1889 Arthur Stayner City Red Sept 4 1889 ENDENTRY Salt Lake City Utah  May 7, 1889.

About this time, word reached me that the government was making some experiments, looking into the manufacture of sugar from sorghum and I conceived the idea that it would be a good thing to test, simultaneously, the capability of the climate and the soil of Utah,  to produce crystalizable sugar; and I concluded that if the exper- iments of the government, in other places, proved successful, it would be well for us to know wheither or not it were possible for us to  obtain the benefits of the success; knowing that it is frequently  quite as great an advanteage to know what you can not do, as to know  what you can do.  With this object in view, eight years ago, I commenced these experiments. Perhaps, if had consulted my friends and sought their  advice at that time, I might have been with-held from running the  risks and performing the difficulties and arduous tasks which I  set myself; but, I did not do so, ans, consequently, no one else but  myself is to blame, or is responsible for the truoubles and anxieties which I have passed through. And I blame no one; but I am thankful to say that the conception of the idea has not been barren of re- sult. I now know, not only what I can not do, but I know what I can  do; and, as I have before had an opportunity of telling you, I have ENDENTRY May 7 1889 Arthur Stayner City Rec May 9 1889  No answer  Arthur Stayner May 7 1889 ENDENTRY facture, therefore I respectfully urge an immediate request.  I further respectfully urge that I make no appli- cation for financial aid, and unless you are perfectly willing to take this matter under your tutelary guardianship upon receiving Bro Howe's report, all I  will ask of you is the permission to use his report in confirmation of my representations of the possible and probable benefits and profits of the undertaking.  I have conversed with Bro Howe and upon your request he is perfectly willing to make the visit.  So far as the adverse report of Wiley Government  Chemist, mentioned by Bro Young, is concerned, I unhesi- tatingly assert that it is the work of an enemy to the industry of making sugar from sorghum, and the most complete refutation of the animus of the report, and the stultification of him who made it will be found in what Bro Howe will see and the report he makes to you upon it. Wiley reports only his absurd failures  and criminal nonsuccesses in the most unblushing man- ner and in the most dishonest intent stops short of the splendid success made by his successor at Fort Scott Prof. Swenson. What Mr Swenson is doing at ENDENTRY JOHN W. YOUNG, President, ARTHUR STAYNER, Secretary and Treasurer. CHAS. W. HARDY, Engineer. and Superintendent.

Salt Lake City, Utah,  demonstrated, practically, and by actual production, that the climate  and soil of Utah are propitious to the production of crystalizable sugar.  By the old crushing mill process, it is true, with the present  price of sugar, the business would be but meagrely profitable; but  since the introduction and development of the principle of Diffu- sion and its magnificent success as applied to sorghum juices, real- ly doubt^l^ing the out-put, there no longer remains the least doubt,  not only on the practicability, but on the profitableness of the  enterprize; and I now see, and am throughly convinced, that it is  possible for us to save the out-lay of a million dollars a year, and to save it at a profit of 25%.  You say, in your letter: "If the manufacture os^f^ sugar can be  made a profitable pursuit, there is nothing, that we foresee, in the  future circumstances of the people, that would prompt us to counsel  you not to undertake this business."  This relieves the only dubiety I had in my mind; and I am just  as well assured of the practic^a^le results that will follow well ordered efforts, as a miller is assured of obtaining so many pounds of flour from a bushel of wheat, under mill treatment.

On the 2nd March 1887 Hon J. Floyd King in a speech before the House of Representatives upon the Sugar manufacture from Sorghun, openly accused Mr Wiley as follows.  "I charge—First—that this man Wiley has wantonly and extravagantly spent the money appropriated"  "second—that he is, in my judgment, in the employ of French and German beetroot sugar manufacturers and sugar machine builders, and London refiners, whose sole object is to stagnate all efforts of the Government to aid in developing our cane sugar industry by the introduction of the diffusion process"  "That he is working in European sugar interests and against our own his every official and unofficial act since 1882 shows" ENDENTRY JOHN W.

Now, Brother Woodruff, can you expect anything else from a man  who has done this much with these motives, than that he should con- tinue doing, and that he should be willing, knowing as much as I do  about this matter, to risk his all,—his future, upon the issue of  this venture? In my eyes, it is no longer a venture, but a certainty. There is, it is true, some occasion for alarm in the fact that I am  bereft of the tangible support of the Leaders of the people. I can not even reach them in conversation to explain in details, and to  place before them, in the thorough manner that is so desirable, the  prospects of success and the means of over-coming difficulties. And the serious question presents itself, whether or not I can find, in the hearts of the Latter day saints, in the absence of the in- spired teachings of their leaders, a sufficient interest for the  establishment of the principle of self-se^u^stenance, to induce them to embark their means in a project which must appear to them so  vast and difficult of solution.

Dear Brethren:  We are very  short of elders: many, whose time has nearly expired, wish very much to be home at the  Dedication. A number have applied to be released  in time to put in their spring crops, or their years work is lost. Some must be released in con- sequence of ill health. All this, makes it nec- cessary for me to remain in touch with this office, but I must have a warmer climate  than England.  The devil has had a great time in Denmark, near L. C. Miller, H. C. Hansen, elders from home, and many of the Aarhus branch  have received great demonstrations through the visitation of Angels and God Himself (?) through  a Mrs. Jensen, whom this great being called  first a poor woman; but after the elders had stood guard over her for 11 days and nights,  casting the devil out of her many times, was  ENDENTRY 2  called a pure woman. She gave them con- stant revelation: how many times the must  administer to her: the particular part of her body  which the enemy got into: and from what I can learn he invaded every crack and crevice from head to heels. The elders found a pleasant  nook near the house and dedicated the spot to prayer, and here they received many precious revelations. Mrs. Jensen had them The elders administer to her, that  she might ^believe that they believed in her and^ have all cleave in her words. Then claimed that the phrophets Brigham and  John were those giving revelation: the accumula- tion kept on until there was 12 of each kind they fought over the poor woman all three days and  nights. At the expiration of the allotted time, Mrs. Jensen became a pure woman (!) She was then  prepared to give the saints, pure counsel. I laid  the matter before the Lord, but did not feel to go there  myself, so wrote to Prest. Christiansen to take conse with his brethren, and straighten things out. I said  if the Lord had revelations for the people, it would come from the proper source: these spiritual manifes- tations were evil, and the adversary would like to prevent the honest in heart, in that vicinty from ENDENTRY receiving the testimony of the Lord's servants. I send Bro. George E. Young, son of  Lorenzo D., home: he has been here about three months: he will tell you his sin, com- mitted with a woman.

He did so. I happened to be on the same Steamer, being just released from my Mission in the Orient and returning from Jerusalem via Jaffa, Port Said, Alxexandria and Constan- tinople in January 1887. The 1st of February M. Markoff was baptized by Br. Tanner and myself in the Marmora Sea, and from the enclosed letter we learn, that Br. Hintze ordained Br.

We have been very careful to locate a hall in which to hold our regular meetings, in a respecttable part of town. We have succeeded in arrang- ing for a strictly first class hall well furnuished, lighted and heat- ed, located one block east of the  New York Equitable Building at  No. 1646 California Street, where we will hold regular meetings every Sunday commencing at 11 a.m ENDENTRY and 7 p.m. The Elders hall ^have^ all put their means together to pay the rent until we can get others to help us.  We have called upon all persons  whose addressed we had and find they have universally treated us kindly, and we are holding cot- tage meetings several nights in the week in various parts of the city and two cottage meetings on  Sunday, but will hold our Sunday meeting in the future in the place above referred to and will continue  our cottage meetings as usual during the week.  The Lord is opening our way and we seem to be putting in the best work among en^t^ire strangers whose addresses we did not have, but ^we^ con- tinued to call upon them and will endeavor to keep on friendly and soc- iable terms.  To night we hold a cottage meeting ENDENTRY in the house we have rented and  have invited all the neighbors we have chairs for. To-morrow we will hold two meetings in Overland District. The Lord has raised up many friends there and we have full cottage meetings and places  to eat and sleep. I have appointed Elders Zebedee Coltrin to labor in that district.  Inclosed you will find a map  of the state of Colorado, also a map Denver city. You will see the way we have districted the city and the names of Elders laboring in the several fields.  We are making a special effort to reach the people by a thorough system of cottage meetings during the week nights, and at present it seems to be the best way to  spread a knowledge of the truth among the people as we are not ENDENTRY able to pay for a hall more than one day in a week. The hall costs  $2400 per month. We could use 2000 tracts if we had them. We are asked for reading matter often, but cannot furnish ^the^ same as we have loaned out all our books that we can spare.

As suggested by you it has been forwarded to him, and he informs me that he expects to leave for home about the 14th of the month.  He will be missed very much from his field of labor which is at present very promising, and I trust it will be your pleasure and convenience to furnish me some experienced Elders to continue the good work begun.  I have some good worthy young men in the Mission, but they are mostly without experience in the work of the ministry, and for the lack of educational quaifications, diffidence and unnecessary embarrasment often prevent that freedom which is winning and pleasent with the people.  To most successfully prosecute the work of the ministry it seems very desirable that one of experience accompany the inexperienced, as has been very profitably demonstrated in Elder Turner's labors while he has been with us. ENDENTRY Elder Turner will no doubt give you his views of the needs of the field in which he has been engaged, and which I have expressed in a late communication to Prest Cannon. More of the Elders now here expect to be released before long; others to succeed them should be in the field before winter closes in upon them. Many are getting to hear the Gospel, but few feel the importance of obedience to its requirements.  The health of the Elders is mostly very good, including myself and Sister R. and are living in the spirit of their high calling.  With a renewal of the request for more laborers, and an earnest prayerful desire for your continued health and happiness,  I am your Brother, and fellow laborer, Saml W. Richards.  Very well. Let us select some good Elder to go as requested. J. F. S.  sideways text Saml. W.

I got a letter from Br Cowley at the same time and it was one of the most singular letters I Ever got from an Elder in the Vineyard, if He was was in the habit of getting angry you would almost think He was offended at me for interfering with his mission in releasing him on account of health He wants to be let alone, and untram- elled in his mission so he can finish it. He would not be satisfied at all to be called home on Account of Health so I have written to him to stay as long as he pleases and preach to the Gentiles and bring as Many into the kingdom as He can. And the ownly requirment I ENDENTRY made of him was come home 2 or 3 years hence and stay long Enough to get Married and have a boy growing up to take his place when he got to be an old man, and He might spend the rest of his life in the Vineyard if He wanted. President Taylor and all the Brethren were much pleased with his Letter; they thought there was a  snap and ring to his letter that you hardly Ever see from an Elder in the Vineyard for they are generally vary glad to come home so let him stay and do his work you ask if I have any council for you I do not know that I have I think you are doing vary well as well as you can.

I would not disturb your mind with these purp- lexing things, I am confident you are not aware of things which do really exist and that you would not approve of them for if I believed otherwise I should regret coming, for I cannot believe that it is the will of God I should ^suffer^ just such things as thro this I may be called to suffer greater ones, I have, and I do exspect to become a sharve with you not only in the comr ENDENTRY common blessings of life, such as food  and rainment, but also in the privations and  hardships which you may be called in the  providence of God to pass through which  journeying to the place of our destination But, when on a certain day we were journey ing and it had got be noon and I felt quite faint and you had stopped, to feed your cattle, I waited  a good while to have some one introduce  the sating some bread and milk but, the next day I thought I would not wait again, for I was sure it could not make any difference as one and  another were getting milk to drink so I said I would eat a little break and milk for I felt the need of it, so Miss King helped me to the same and asked Phebe which she should get  the last nights milk or mornings, and  she replied, the skim,d milk, I was  astonished, as I knew they had all as it were been drinking milk all the  morning and new milk too, but I never  ENDENTRY drink any myself and I felt that it  was truly hard that I must be denied the privilege of a little good milk and I  said, why, you exspect I suppose illegible your new milk eat or I should illegible it was better to have the poorest  drand, and the best meat and that for my part I had a peculiar preference  to new milk  Why said Miss K. this is good milk, I dipped it out  and I ate it, but exspressed feelings  of not entire satisfaction and Phebe  says, we have calculated for a general thing to use our nights milk first so  that we can get some cream from the  best I could not understand how they  could raise cream while the milk was in the waggon, so I enquired of her, and I also knew that the new milk had  been eaten and drank every after I came  here, and she finally said, Why no, we  don't exspect to set our milk for butter in the day time, and so it ended leaving  ENDENTRY me as much in the dark as when I  (Gillet Samuel - 1 Giddings Linus - 3)  commenced the inquiry.  I must say, I was tried, a day or two after this becoming way faint before anyone spoke of  eating and as you had stopped, I got some milk to eat, I helped your father to some also and  (Hurd Willson  strane as it may  (Hart Beaulah)  appear there seemed to be  a dissatisfaction in Phebes mind on account of  the liberty taken, tho nothing was said  in regard to new milk or old milk for I think it  was mixed together, but while father and I was eating something was said about her  eating some and ^she^ replied that she had been waiting for others to get through, why said  I Phebe need you wait for me so long as  I bring my own dishes and bread, she replied  that we could not all eat at once and this I did not then, nor do I now comprehend,  the next thing that presented itself in regard to milk was that as Sarah had been ENDENTRY Dear Son  having some few things laying on my mind in addition t what I have already exspressed to y I will further say, that altho I do no feel disposed to notice every little trivial occurrence which may, ha or shall, hereafter occur in a unusal manner, and yet permit ^me^ to say, that  I do think I have not myself been treated in some respects according to  justice and judgement since I have been  in your said midst  I will however  say that I do exspect so long as you I remain with you to become a sharer in  all the varied sanes which a wiled  omnipotent hand shall see fit to call us  unto whether it be in adversity or prosperity, in privation and want, or in a state of plenty. But I do feel that as you have taken as your Parents with also with the  intention of providing for us the  ENDENTRY that daughter Phebe should feel disposed to turn me off with a piece of old bread for supper which was so hard that  I would not give it illegible to Wilford to eat (as  he asked me just before to give him some). and especially since I gave what I had the night  before to the family being enough for thier meals for my family and it was very light, tender and good too, and Wilford, I did want it, tho, all the fuss I made about it, was, that I went to the pandor by and helped myself to some new bread, saying  meantime, that I had ^no^ notion of accepting of such hard bread in exchange for that which  was tender and good, and now I will say, that I could not have done less than I did without being made  really afflicted with hard feelings such as I do not like to feel ENDENTRY entrusted with the care of the smilk Sariah should should be called on to dip out milk for every  one who wanted G I think, I remarked to her that I thought there might be ^*at the time^ some execpt- ions to that rule ^for, indeed I was wanting some^ with out destroying the order of the same for indeed I felt, at once that I should never be conformed to a rule like that, which living with my children and especially when I was as competent to not only to dip out ^milk^ with as great carefulness as any one but also to make and take enough  butter in quite as orderly a manner yet was fucrueted by Sahab, but I was at once that Phebe intended to suffer any no except to the rule as she said it would be of no use to establish such a rule unless it was closly adharied to by every individual, but for my part I felt that it might be necessary for the family in general, especially for men and children at the particular ones were not subjugated and now I will say to you that I have not practiced it all since the time of calling on Sarah for milk and I will I ever of all ENDENTRY more butter ^at^ a meal usually than your father has formu   enou  my reasons.  In the first place I considered it as unsaint like, and in the next as unchild like to require me todoso, and in the third place, I was sure that I should not enjoy anything in mind if I felt obliged to conform to a rule like this, I should feel it ^to^ be wrong and only intly should have hard feelings I this I do not like to feel towards any friend and besides, just look at the necessity of your Mother being conformed, or subject to such a rule, when the only time I should have occasion to call on Sarah is at night and then I am almost surrounded with new Milk in our Tent every pan just alike except there should be one not quite as full as the rest, and in this case, I am sure to know which it is without going to Sarah but now Wilford you will see at once that you need not much disestorment to see that your Mother is required to take a lower seat than your sevants, for she is denied privilege that ENDENTRY enterested with the can of themilk Sariah that they do enjoy, for Sarah of course   forevery can have the frivilege of getting milk when and where, and as much as she pleases now I do think it a little curious, that when you do have such an abundance of milk and every one who wishes can drink it when they please, and as I do not drink any at all, but only want the privilege of eating a little with bread, at night as well as at noon, since itis the case, that Ido not take but very little supper, of course want a little on going to bed, a thing which I have preach -ed a good many years. when I had milk and when I had not, a little of some thing else, I say, I do think it curious that I should be this restricted in regard to this privilege and in a special manner as as I have eat but so very little butter since I have been journeying, and I am sure that my family have not disposed of ENDENTRY more butter ^at^ a meal usually than your father has formerly made use himself, but, enough about the aitute, milk, and I will leave this sub- ject by saying that I do concider it the most an accountable thing that Pheby, mind should be led to such a course of treatment towards me un- less it be a trade in her disposition for I can say in truth, that I came with all her friendly feelings towards her, which are necessary to treat one with every due isprest, and I designed in my heart to be to her as a Mother, the same as to Cunice Savr, that I did not calculate, as she has a number of children, that I should ^not^ be able to assist in the taking case of children, neither did I think it necessary as she was well provided for with help, and I cannot think Wilford that there was anything in my demeanour towards Phebe that could possibly be the occasion of such treatment as I have in many other instances (which I have not named) viewed from her hand for indeed there has been many things tho small in their nature which have been extremely mortisfying  ENDENTRY 74  to my feelings.  and such things as I have heuting you been an entire stranger unto, The uncommeitating spirit manifested by Mis King in regard to cooking illegible does I think bear testimony to the degree of resect by which I am held, in her estimation ^th them^ and now I ^and family^ will say, that after all, as much as I sat by this article milk the principle manifested in the presence of strangers have wieghed more in my mind than all the rest, but another small thing I will just name which hurt my feelings at the time we had occasion to tarry over night away from our provisions a little before you came, Phebe, in reply to my saying I did not know what we should do in regard to supper, asked if I had not some bread, I told her I had a few biscuit she said we would take them and they would make us some in the morning if I insisted on it.  The next day that night as we had not our bread baked for supp to and Miss King had got hers done and cooked I said to Phebe that I should like to get some of them for supper she says, will but as I turned to go into the tent where the bread was she enjoined there is a piece of old bread that ought to be eaten first!  I was struck at the tho ENDENTRY that daughter Phebe should feel disposd to tuson me off with a piece of old bread for supper which was so hard that I would not give it to Wilford (as he asked me for some) a spicially since I gave what I had the night before to her family being enough for three heats for my family, and it was very light, tender and good, too.  and I alsoways feel that good bread makes every thing good and that which is poor, therewise and Wilford I did want it, this all the first I made about it was, to go to the fan don by helped myself to some new bread , saying meanti- me, that I had no notion of accepting of such hard bread, in exchange fo that which was tender and good,  and now I will say that I would not have done less than I did without being miserably afflicted, with hard feelings such as I do not like to feel, Another thing I will State, which I think may be asample of thme is representation which have existed between us you will rcollect of milking a little one day  at noon for your Joseph and I partook with him yaco, the manner in which Phebe inter  liece the thing to you, caused me to feel ashamed of myself, she says, Wilford, Mother, wanted a little new milk I could not avoid saying that Phebe designed to have some for Joseph and I said ENDENTRY 74   to my feelings and such things as I have beuting you been an entire stranger unto The uniommetating spirit manifested by Miss King in regard to cooking and to does I think bear testimony to the degree of espect by which I am held in her estimation andby them^ and now I ^and family^ will say, that after all, as much as I sat by this asticle milk the principle manifested in the presence of Strangers has wieghed more in my mind than all the rest, but another small thing I will just name which hurt my feelings at the time we had occasion to tarry overnight awy from our provisions a little before you came, Phebe, in reply to my saying I did not know what we should do in regard to supper, asked if I had not some bread, I  told her I had a few biscuit, she said we would take them and they would make up some in the morning if I insisted on it.  The next day has night as we had not our breat baked for supp to er Miss King had got hers done and cooled I said to Phebe that I should like to get some of them for supper she says, will but as I turned to go into the itent where the bread was she enjoinand there was a piece of old bread that ought to be eaten first!  I was struck at the that  ENDENTRY that daughter Phebe should feel disposd between me off with a piece of old bread for supper which was so hard that I would not give it to Wilford (as he asked me for some) acespecially since I gave what I had the night  before to the family being enough for three meals for my family, and it was very light, tender and good too, and I always feel that good bread makes  every thing good and that which is poor, the reverse, and Wilford I did want it, the all the fuss I made about it was to go to the pan clon andy helped myself to some new bread saying meanti- me that I had no notion of accepting of such hard bread, in exchange for that which was tender and good, know I will say that I would not have done less than I did, without being miserably afflicted, with hard feelings such as I do not like to feel. Another thing I will State which I think may be a samplel of them is representations which have existed between us you will recollect of milking a little one da at noon for your Joseph and I partook with him was the manner in which Phebe interdlived the thing to you, caused me to feel ashamed of myself she says Wilford Mother wanted a little new milk I could not avoid saying that Phebe designed to have some for Joseph and I said  ENDENTRY that I should like a little warm milk should they be at the trouble to milk some tho, I had no Idea of having any, and Pheb says you can have some Mother, I thought her very good  but, did not think it fair her putting the  matter in such a light, for indeed it is not  my principle nor never was my disposition  to require such attentions, tho, I think there may have been some excatisons to make it  appear that I have been selfish, a trial which  I have never before been accused of and it is my  opinion, that if you Wilford have any feelings in your breast, that I have illegible in my daily  conduct or conversation, from the froth of  rectitude, or wisdom, since I have been in your midst, It must be ^either^ from a course of such  misrepresentations as was manifest in  regard to the milk or of a similar nature, or  perhaps in connections with some things of a grosser nature from others, or from the fact that you and I differ in jugment in respect  to what is right and wrong, you may perhaps think I lay too much stress upon the manner of Phebes speaking to you as she did about the   ENDENTRY Milk, but, just look at the subject for  one moment and concider what your views sould have been without an explanation, and tho, the thing in itself concidered was small yet it is easy to be seen that great things might come from it, for instance, that shee  was really disposed to make it appear to your mind that your Mother was very  difficult, notional, and selfish, what better  evidence could she want to present to your mind, than the fact, that your Mother  required the privilege of having a cow milked at noon, that she might be accom- modated with new and warm milk, certainly there is no one but would concider it an unreason- able requirement. Well, did not the language Phe used, convey the Idea in full that I required this privilege, most certainly it did, but after all it could not be said in truth that I asked such a thing, altho, I said, to be sure after she told me of her intended to have some  milked for Joseph, that I should like some good warm milk very well, my- self - But one thing I will suggest, that   ENDENTRY I have ^had^ newly much occasion of for  Matrimony  thought upon since I have been with you  vis, that of having some rule, or some whatsaid, whereby I might know what, and where, such provisions were that you  exspected me and my family to share with  you in, for indeed I have thought strange that Phebe did not, (unless she had heard  you give the invitation,) just say, Mother  here is this, that and the other perhaps some  beans, a little rice, Pork andc, which we  shall exspect you to help yourselves to,  as you like, but nothing of this sort has been said to me at any time the  first  I knew about any Beans Phebe gives dir- ections to have some cooked for her fami- ily, I felt in a particular manner as if I should like some to cook, but nothing was said, till a day or two I then to her that I should like some beans to cook also. She replied, you know where they are ENDENTRY which was the first knowedge I had of the beard any way suffice it to say then I cooked some (soon after this ground there was rice on board by their making some pudding of it. but not one word had been said to me abut helping myself and family, but I do think Wilford that it is me more than propper if you expect I wish your Parents to share with ^you^ in the comforts you have to give them a general invitation to help them set up and that too in the presence of your family for indeed there is no one, but would feel delicate in my situation but feel delicate to have for things in the persence of strangers in a special manner but you ^may^ be as send that if Phebe had asked as great exciting ones taken me helpers to the comforts of life as she has to keep them from me. I should not have wanted for any thing I do think as you assay. to provide for your Parents on this occasion, that it is no more ^than^ propper I should have the privilege of having change of so great as have of the Meth as ENDENTRY is necessary for myself and family, no I have been used to having a little of the  top of the milk to put in my tea and coffe bu now I have in some cases to use skimmed milk, but I learn that Phebe and her girls use  cream and I have took a very little when I could  get a chance, but I have to be as private as  murder, but it or I should get a great trimming, !!! now I shall hope never to  hear again daughter Eunice, blamed for  speaking against Phebe for she did not  till me half as much as I have exspere- enced, and every word, she did tell me would  be the case has been more than fulfill- ed, and she disclosed to me that she had never said one word to illegible ibour agai nst, Phebe, except to those who were pres- ent, and knew for themsef the meantrial- ment, she had received at times from her and now, it is evident that all the stir that had  been made since over it at Nauvoo, has  been made through the same instrument- atity of misrepresentation that you got the  ENDENTRY impression from that Betsay 63 Bedfore I came here was full of remarks against the principles of the church and that you could not nor would not have such things, well, I thought it rather strange that Betsay should exercise so little wisdome, but I determined to speak to her on the subject and I did so but she seemed astonished, I said she could not remain ^any^ at first of one word being said on the subject, but finally she said she did recollect that ^on^ a certain occasion a few words was exchanged in some what of a tarfline character, by way of argument which amounted to nothing as it were, but it was spoken openly in a more said or thought about it as she knew I was convienced that whoever was instrumental of making such illegible  pression on your mind was strangely out of the way, but duty calls me to you ^she also^ of the incident which took place yesterday morning between Phebe and Betsey, Phebe came in while we were all about dressing and they as is very common was cleaning the bed after I was and bring close by Betsey she happened to  ENDENTRY throw some of her bigmeared things onto Betseys bed or to her and Betsey, says to her (as she afterwards informed me) I wish you would not throw your dirty cloaths onto me and as I do not want besmeard things under my nose, always, This she said she had often exspressed to Mary  and she would care nothing about it but on this occasion Phebe being resent her grit was  stirred, and she spoke very short and harshly to Betsey and threw spring, out to in of her being so part- icular tha no one might touch her things Betsey insisted that she had done no more than to tie up her bed for the sake of convin ience and to keep it as desent as possibly and also to have a plan to lay other things onto and Phebe said, you will throw other peoples things about, but this Betsey denied a Phebe said she had been told so, Betsey then asked the girls if they had told her such things and they all at one denied telling any such thing, but Betsey heard, Phebe sying to Mary you did tell me that Betsey threw off at a certain time some shitten clouths you put on her bed three times over but Mary said she could remember one such thing, of course the great accersation against Betsey was when the girls threw shitten cloaths on her bed, that she  ENDENTRY took the liberty to throw them off, and Betseys feelings on regard to this subject is similar to mine viz that  that the more careful we are to keep our things orderly the better it will be for their company in general - more I do not know of but one thing that Phebs can with any perprinty bring up against me and that is nothing at all in one sense, but one day, as little Phebe oders an too, I think come in to the Tent with some greasy rituals in their hands but Betseys bed was tied up and any convinient to sit down on they took seats on it and as she was absent I felt it duty to call them as I did that they shouldnot sit with their rituals on and and Betseys bed, and added, you should never sit down on other peoples bed, wondering that I was talking to children but just at that moment Phebe came in and I can assure you that she took me to do at a great rate I told her that I was one of the last persons that ever practised any patirulanslief that would come in con- trol with any ones comfort or happiness that I concidered on this occasion that I was talking to childre, but all did not do, but I do wonder if Phebe thinks that after all the children I have taken care of both of our own and Br Ozuns ENDENTRY to go to school, andc I concidering my poor health, as also the abundance of help she  has for the taking care of children, that I  came here with the exspectation of having an sort of care of her children, I have thoughtf a good while that if any of my sisters shoul die and leave young children that I should not  feel it duty to do anything about taking car of them, but last of all, I must say that I  never in my whole life avoided viewed myself so Thankfully treated, as she treated me this morning, as the girls were going to wash  I told father to present his shirts, as I was not  able to do more than wash my own illegible and tho I might sometimes wash my night dress 2 shimms and as for Betsey, I have never expected she would do my washing for she had not been able to do more than her own for a  good while past, I also had a sheet on my bed  which was got very dirty in the wet weather and  sheet I spoke at being washed, and Phebe hearing a the waggon sent for Mary and told her they might  wash fathers cloaths, but no more  I went to the  carriage and said to her, that there is a very dirty  sheet on my bed, which I was unable to wash, but she gave me understand no washing but father  would be done and after saying I thought there was ple ENDENTRY of help to do it and she says, how great help. I replyed, that when she was at our house in  Farmington and I had one wash woman, which came  once in two weeks to wash for me and I had her do  your washing, Phebe replied, she did not do  my clothing, for I did it myself and a great  deal more when I want able hardly, to sit up Phebe, said and, you did not do your washing  at least not a great deal of it, you might have  done your childs, will you give me the lie  Mother illegible she, Phebe said I, I know what  I said to you on the subject, for I told you that  you need not undertake to wash at all, that  Mrs Stone would do it tho if you were illegible you might do your diapers, and I do know that  Wilford heard me on some occasions tell you  not do do it, you might however done some part of it, but as for your doing the whole and much more washing any of my cloaths  you never did it Phebe, she then comes up and  in the presence of Miss King, says, and besides  that, I had to take care of my child when I  want hardly able to get up, and you never pretended  to take it up or take any notice of it good  heavens said I Phebe I was in a glorious good state  to be able to give special time to the taking  care of my child when I had been worn down  to the quick by being up nights and upon a illegible thro the daytime on account of Ex extreme ENDENTRY 69   sickness and at the time you were here I had quite a number in my

was seated in the front chamber a working of muslin. but to sum it up I could hardly get a chance to put in ^a^ word edgeways,   I tell you what I think about Phebe and mr Wilford and feelings, such a spirit towards me as it evident she has a very bad ^one^ towards me, it is because that when we arrived at Eun with a babe of a week old, that I did not instead of helping her and taking care of her babe when they were not able even to hire a nurse go into your room and wait on her child- ren and herself and be ready to anddo anything that might come in my way and let Eunice go and her fam- ly,

confidently do I believe  that that there is not a woman on the  earth who can claim the aphellation of  a wife whose feelings are illegible  susceptible of kindness or illegible  by a companion, nor

passed a way but I perceive a seerived of the same in a special manner since I joined this Camp which has tended to weigh down my spirits and to cast a gloom over my journey to California, but whatever you may fel to impart this change in the mind of your Father unto any one else, I can say in truth that I know when it commands by what instrument illegible he limplion ENDENTRY was presented to his mind, it was at the time we were looking for your arrival at Farmington and began to fear you were Shipwricked, and we both felt very anxious, but as you did not come your father said to me one day on what do you think we shall do if he should not come, (suming to feel a very different frame of mind than he had before) Why, said I, have no doubt but thier would be some way provided for us but I should feel it to be a great calamity whatever might become of us, but I percieved at once that your father had or was giving away to quite a new spirit from what he had for a long time previous, as he began to explict upon me for those things and others, for which I was no more to blame than I was because you didnot come at the time appointed and this spirit has continued to a greater or less degree till the present time. and when we came to Nauvoo ENDENTRY there seemed to be a plenty to feed and  promote this undue and unjust spirit, every word spoken by myself ever so hone stly was invested into a bughear and become  a crime worthy of deep censure, and since I joined the Camp, your father has treated  me with the greatest neglect, indifference,  and hostility, so much as that he has hardly  given me a pleasant word and besides in  one or two instances he has treated me  before company in the most unfeeling  and unreasonable manner as in the case  of three evenings past, the one in which  I dissolved a part of a pill for susane and wailed on Marys limb which she had hurt and administered some what to Lars  he being sick, and what was the great  cause, of those dreadful answers I  had why, after I had got through the  doing of good, I seated myself in the  Rocking chair to rest a moment expe- cting to undress me very shortly but But  had wanted a discloth and I took in my ENDENTRY Saunders Oliver  2 Saunders Harry   2  hand a piece of old bed tick to cut off  one or two, while I rested me a little, your  father had got to bed and as is very natural  to him began to speak of my going to bed  I told him I was coming directly but wanted  to sit one moment, andc , but this did not  satisfy but began to frown in a most  unfriendly manner and to accuse me of  such things as a great deal of women  far worse than myself never ought to  be guilty of and that in the presence of  Miss King, Mary and Sarah untill I was  ashamed, yet I could not think neither  can I now, that I had done anything  out of order, or negleglected to do any  thing which I ought to have done and I  felt and do still, that the trials I have  been called to pass through of leaving  Eunice and family with her poor state of  health and extreme poverty, is absuredtly  sufficient for me to grapple with ENDENTRY 92 without the addition of a repectician of those trials which I have fomerly experiences in consequence of an earnest desire for the salvation of the soul of my companion, and I deffeel an assurance that your father cannot enjoy any good degree of prosperty either in body or spirit untill he seeks repentance at the hand of god, and I ahve no more doubt of his being convinced eer lings of the unrighteous course he has persued than I have of any thing which I am assured will come Indeed he cannot stand it much he already fals with the Apostle Paul that it is hard to kick agaisnt the pricks I do not wish, nor have I time to particularize but, when your father left son Websters house at bedrim just before he was a about to take his final leave of his only Daughter when he designed ENDENTRY to spend the night with us and that without any provceation at all again intimating that he had been driven back by opporition and Slander I tumbled in view of the final wait to him especially knowing that he would  Wordruff Aphak    2 . 3 - 4

myself (save to express their pleasure at his calling on them) I am sure that I said nothing but what was highly proper and not cal- culated in its nature to injure any one, and I will now say that there has been the greatest misrepresent- ations as to the remarks and feelings both of myself (both of myself) and Wibster ENDENTRY that I ever knew carried out by professedly honest people, but I trust your father is beginning to come to himself I have been none afraid but that the Lord would eventually bring him there but my greatest fears have been the undue effects which would undoubtedly follow the coves, which he and others have persued, but the time will come when you will know for cer- tainly that some impressions you have had of late were without a good foundation I do not however attach any blame to you, but I have written these lines from a principle that it is far better for one when any thing lies heavy on the mind to diver- lge it rather than to feel a hardn- ess on the

My dear Brother: Just a word of advise: Senator Cannon often comes to New York and is willing and kind enough to speak at our Sunday  services. The question is, will it be right for me to put an add  in the paper, stating that the Senator will speak and also to  publish a synopsis of his sermon. I am expecting to hold a con- ference here in Greater New York in a few weeks and the Senator has consented to come up and speak^,^ on one condition^,^ and i, e.,  that you will have no objection to me advertizing that the  senator will preach.  I understand th^a^t Senator Cannon is doing some confiden- tial business for you and I would not wish to do anything that  would hinder or interfer with your business in any way. Brother  Cannon was with us last Sunday and the Sunday before here at our  services and we enjoyed his talk very much and I believe he can  do some good for the meritorious cause in which we are engaged.  We have plenty of work for go^o^d inteligent young men  who are humble and well equiped with a knowledge of the gospel. We have some good singers with us from "Zion" and our services are quite interisting and attractive. We have a few very nice  recent converts and expect to batpize two more next Sunday.

I find after being a member of this  Church fifty seven years this  month; that I am under the  necessity of asking assistance from the Church for my future support, I ask this favor of you in confidence, the more so; because  I have been promised repeatedly by Brother Brigham Young, who; the last time but one that he was south; sent for me, and told me, that he had bought a house in the city for me, and  that hereafter my family, should be provided for, that I, had suffered ENDENTRY enough, and the Lord did not require me to suffer any more. I never received the house, or any thing, for I suppose he forgot all about me, having more important Business to attend to. My house is  Built of inch Lumber, and very cold in Winter and hot in summer. I have not lived in a house that was plastered in any part; since I came to the mountains, but  that does not matter much, as I am used to hardships of all kinds. I have never called on the Church for aid; until, the long sickness, and Death of Mr Lightner accompanied by a series of misfortunes compelled me to apply to Brother Taylor for assistance. Just before my Husband died, Brother Taylor allowed me two hundred Dollars a year during his life time, but intimated that he would incre^ase^ the amount at his death—he died two years ago—and left me in  debt over a hundred Dollars—a Jew has my note for $8000 Eighty Dollars and I have not a Dollar to pay  on it—the rest of the debt is  paid. I have not received a cent since Brothers ^Taylors^ death. I have Aunt Gilbert to support, who; is  now in her Eighty-Eighth year of her age, and a cripple. I borrowed money to come up, hoping to see you,  I find my only alternative is to  pen these lines to you, hoping the Lord will direct you in this matter I was sealed to Brother ^Josephs^ family in the Spring of 1831. And when Zions Camp went to Missouri,  he received a Commandment to take me for a wife—But was  afraid—and I was not sealed to him as a wife, until 1841—  ENDENTRY I cincerely hope you will not pass this request by, for I assure you; that unles I am assisted, I  must suffer for both food, and  clothing for the coming Winter.  Please answer this letter as soon as convenient. Direct to the care of Hellen, M. Whitney—and I can get it. I shall be here a few days longer.

Sir JOHN THOMPSON continued his explanation of the clauses of the bill dealing with Mormons.  Mr. BLAKE thought it was not enough that they should apprehend what the attitude of the Government was with reference to the persons who had given birth to the legislative  clauses before them. They had heard vari- ous rumours and words of encouragement to a section of people called Mormons in the North-West. These words of encouragement seemed to him out of place, if their doctrines were what was represented. There were in Ontario certain small scattered communities of the Joseph Smith school, who, so far as he could ascertain, had proved themselves good emigrants and obeyed the laws. They were of a different class to those of the Latter Day Saints who had settled in the North-West. It was right to emphasize the fact of the diffi- culties that the State have had with the Utah Mormons, and that very strin- gent measures had to be adopted by the Republic against their practices. This was in consequence of the extreme solidarity and determination of the people to persist in concealing the legal evidence of their abominable practices. As far as one could judge, there was a disposition on a con- siderable part of these people to seek a more congenial soil than Utah. It seemed to him that the settlement in the North-West was such as to enable members on both sides to support the Minister of Justice to provide stringent laws against such polygamous practices. The settlement called upon them to give expressions of discouragement rather than approval of such a colony in their midst. He read from the will of Brigham Young, from which a glimpse, he said, was obtained of their marriage customs. Simple cohabitation, in accordance with the Mormon Church, seemed to be one of the principal, conditions of mar- riage. In the Judgement of Mr. Justice Ander- son, issued in 1889, he found that the belief of the Mormons was that their Church was the actual and veritable kingdom of God on earth, that this kingdom was both temporal and spiritual, that it would overthrow the United States, that polygamy was a com- mand of God, and that the Congress of the States had no right to pass any law antagon- istic to Mormonism, it was stated that the North-West Mormons did not live in a polygamous state, but it was stated that there was a suspicious disproportion of the sexes there. He had a letter from a friend in Utah, who was cognizant with the course of events transpiring there, and he told him that in some instances the Mormons who had gone to the North-West had not brought their own wives, but that in such cases had taken each a fresh young girl. (Laughter.) He did not think that their friends from the North-West should be eager to promote settlers of this description.  It was neither wholesome nor profitable. All that they could do was to put in opera- tion all the legal machinery they could for the discontinuance of these abominable practices. He thought they were bound to support the Minister of Justice in any reason- able attempt to stamp out this crime of polygamy. It should also be indicated in the clearest language that it was not words of encouragement but words of discourage- ment that this Parliament had for Mor- monism.  Mr. DEWDNEY said that some years ago two or three of the leaders of the North- West Mormons visited Ottawa asking for concessions from the Government. He had one or two interviews with them. The ap- plications they made were not granted, but they stated most distinctly that they had no intention of practising the tenets of their faith in the settlement. They gave the Gov- ernment the most abundant assurance on that point. Since then there had been rumours that they had abandoned their promises. An effort had been made by the Government to ascertain if there was any foundation for these reports, and through his deputy he communicated with the leaders of the Mor- mons in the North-West for explanations. They replied, and stated emphatically that they were not practising polygamy, that they made a solemn promise when they went there and they were determined to keep it.  Mr. BLAKE—What were the nature of the concessions they wanted?  Mr. DEWDNEY—They wished to be al- lowed to settle in communities in the hamlet system, that is that they could live together and live in the communal system.  Mr. BLAKE—The great difficulty with these people is that they are being driven out of the States because laws are put in force against them. There is no reason to suppose that they will abandon their practices here. It is a serious question.  Sir JOHN MACDONALD—No doubt it is.  Mr. BLAKE—They have to leave their own country and settle here, apparently to carry out their abominable practices. Why should they come here to obey laws which they have refused to obey in the States?  Mr. DEWDNEY—They were fleeing from justice.  Mr. MULOCH thought a more rigid penal- ty should be imposed. Under the bill a merely nominal fine might be imposed.  Sir JOHN THOMPSON consented to im- prisonment being made the penalty for polygamy.  Mr. CHARLTON said that no encourage- ment should be given to the Mormons to come to Canada. They were an undesirable  element.  Mr. McMULLEN said it was much to be regretted, that any inducement whatever  should have been held out to these people. It was exceedingly unwise that the slightest encouragement should have been given to  them. It would have been better to have prevented them from coming.  Mr. DEWDNEY—What inducements  were offered to these men?  Mr. McMULLEN—There was correspon- dence.  Mr. DEWDNEY—We answer all letters.  Mr. LAURIER said that these people were officially recognized.  Mr. BLAKE—I understand that the Lieu- tenant-Governor visited the settlement and stayed at the house of Mr. wife is one of the numerous daughters of Brigham Young.  Mr. DEWDNEY—That was not inducing  them to come to Canada.  Mr. BLAKE—It was inducing them to  stay.  Mr. MITCHELL agreed that these people should be compelled to obey the law, but he did not think they should be prevented from coming to Canada.  Sir JOHN THOMPSON said no encour- agement had been given to the Mormons to come to Canada. They left Utah because, as they alleged, they were hardly used generally and there was a prejudice against them. Therefore they sought refuge in Canada. Some of these people were British  subjects by birth. They were told distinctly that they must understand the people of Canada would be as firmly opposed to  polygamy as the United States were. They replied that they simply wanted a refuge  and were willing to submit to the law. They discussed the matter generally and argued with him the principles of Mormonism, but he told them there would be no leniency towards polygamy.  Mr. MULOCK said it was clear from this  statement that the Mormons had entertained  a hope of perpetuating their institutions in Canada.  The clause was carried.  The committee after passing a number of clauses rose and reported progress.

Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.  My dear Brother: With pleasure I hand you herewith our financial report for the past three months. You see we are able to keep our head above water, and we have a very nice office to invite our strangers in to see us, such as news paper reporters ect. Indeed I am happy to say we have a very comfortable conference house.  I am prepared to receive our brethern as they come to their fields of labor. We have about 120 Elders in this field and it seems as though we could use that many more to a good advantage Wehave only baptized upwards of 100 people since my time here, but I think that is fairly good when we consider that nearly all of our Elders are new in the field. Our Neophites, what we have are good inteligent people, and we are educating them hiow to pay tithing and live their religion.  I have been all through the field twice and have organized Eleven Conferences. Our Elders are full of faith and determined to do their duty. Part of them travel without money. Recently while I was at Boston holding conference I met an old member of our Church who was Baptized by Prest. Young and he has not seen one of our Elders before for 45 Yrs. With love to your self and Coworkers, I remain, with prayers for "Zion's" triumph,  Your brother,   A P Kesler  Very good letter. J. F. S.
