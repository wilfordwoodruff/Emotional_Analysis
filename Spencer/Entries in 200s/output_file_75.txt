The San  Francisco  I have the honor to repre- sent, will publish about  February 1st next, a special- edition to be known as the  Midwinter Fair edition, which  will be devoted to the in- terests of the Western states and territories. This paper will be the best newspaper  ever published in America. ENDENTRY    throughout the world   little over two years ago we were im- pressed to call upon the Latter-day  Saints to set apart a day for fasting and solemn prayer unto the Lord. Our position at that time was such  that it seemed as though no earthly power could deliver us from the evil which environed us and which threat- ened our overthrow. Turn which way we would, every avenue seemed closed against us. Human help was be- yond our reach. Our eyes and hearts under those circumstances, turned to  the Lord as the only power to which we could appeal for succor. Do we say too much when we testify that the Lord did on that occasion condescend  to hear and answer the supplication of His people.   not without its fruits. If the objects which were suggested in our circular letter at that time to be prayed for be examined, the results will show how wonderfully the Lord has granted the  prayers of His people?   shown unto us by our Father in  heaven in permitting us, at our recent General Conference, to lay the top stone of the Salt Lake Temple with shouts of Hosanna to God and the  Lamb, it has suggested itself to us that  it would be most appropriate for the Latter-day Saints to gather in their various places of worship, on Sunday the first day of May, 1892, and in fast- ing and prayer, offer up to the Most High their heartfelt and solemn thanksgivings for His goodness and mercy, which He has shown unto them and the deliverance that He has wrought out in their behalf.   for thanksgiving and praise than have  the Latter-day Saints throughout these mountains. And as we cannot have  occasion for thanksgiving because of  deliverance wrought our for us, with- out our brethren and sisters in other lands sharing in our joy, it is proper that they, too, should select a day, as may be suitable and convenient to them, in like manner to fast and pray and offer up their gratitude and thanks to the Great Creator for the blessings He has bestowed upon His people.   for this purpose, because it can meet with a more general observance on the part of all the people than would be  possible upon any other day.   longing to our Church should join in this glad service, for, although we have many obstaclcs to con- tend with, and the adversary of our souls has not made truce, nor laid down his arms, yet the Lord has spoiled many nf his schemes, and des- troyed his snares, and has provided for us a way of escape from his power.   plicate the Almighty Father to con- tinue to bless and deliver His Zion, and to prepare the way for the ushering in of the full reign of righteousness and truth, when He whose right it is to reign shall hold undisputed sway over all the earth.   mously adopted by the immense as- semblage of people at the laying of the  top-stone of the Temple:   President Woodruff, respecting the early completion of the Salt Lake Temple, is the word of the Lord to us, I propose that this assemblage pledge themselves, collectively and individu- ally, to furnish, as fast as it may be needed, all the money that may be re- quired to complete the Temple at the  earliest time possible, so that the dedi- cation may take place on April 6th, 1893.   collection of the funds needed to com plete the Temple in accordance with this resolution: but we have decided that no better occasion could offer for this purpose than the time when the Saints shall be assembled to ob- serve this day of prayer and thanks- giving. Subscriptions can then be taken by the various Bishops and other presiding officers from all who are present at the meetings; and if all are not prepared to give that which they  desire to subscribe at the time, they can make their arrangements to pay by installments.   should be completed so that the sacred building can be dedicated to the Lord at the General Conference, April 6th, 1893. Steps have already been taken to have the work done, with the full expectation that the funds which were voted for when this reso- lution was adopted will be forthcoming in time to meet all the payments. We  feel assured there will be no disap- pointment in this, if the Bishops and other presiding authorities do their  duty.   ter-day Saints feel more deeply inter- ested than in the building and com- pleting of Temples.   long been in process of erection. By the 6th of April next, forty years will have elapsed since the laying of the founda- tion stones. It seems proper, then, that the expiration of that period should wit- ness its dedication.

I readily recognize, and I feel keenly, the difference in  the circumstances of the true friends of the people before and  after the commencement of the "Grand Steal". Heretofore the establishment of an industrial enterprise for the benefit of  our people has been much more easily reached than it can possibly be at the present time, because, with the will the people's best friends had the means to assist with the lubricating element of money as well as influence and friendship. Now money is out of the question but influence and friendship and the power to use them remain.   has dammed up the source and turned the channels and cur- rents of fertilizing means from where they could be used for prac- tical benefits, into courses barren of good results, and have these partially paralysed the hand of material assistance, and now to  keep as much as possible absolute control out of the hands of iminical and paralysing power seems to be the great desideratum; to do this I appeal to you for your help and counsel. ENDENTRY  ness I represent; the profits, to say the least of them, will be very considerable from the beginning and the business properly managed will assume magnificent proportions, and in a few years those who control it will be in the front ranks of our finiancial world. Wise manipulation, prudent counsel, and competent assistance right now will in all probability secure this control. He who feels interested for the welfare of this people would feel very much chagrined, to have levied upon them, when employed profitably &amp; remuneratively in this business, a monthly tribute for the support of the "loyal league" or to see them superseded by Chinamen, or worse the lowlived tramps and apostates who are enlisted in the Devil's forces, or to have this magnificent financial power wielded for the crushing out of the last vestige of  freedom and liberty left to us. God has not only prepared and preserved but he has given to us this country; He has blessed the  soil, increased the water, made the elements conducive to fertility, withheld the frost, advanced the seasons, and made this portion of his creation ^beautiful and enviable, and^, at our solicitation and to gratify our pleasure, and to make our homes pleasant and desirable He has given us the wisdom and the  energy to develop the resources of our mountain land. Shall we  easily and without consideration and effort allow any portion of the  control of these choice blessings to pass out of our possession?   and a half millions a year; it means the employment of over a thousand hands, and the manipulation of the vast wealth that will inevitably accumulate around this nucleus.

Faithfully, ploddingly and patiently I have centralized my efforts upon that one object and have allowed nothing to stand in the way of its accomplishment.  No sacrifice has been too great, no jeopardy too venturesome, no reasonable consideration too precious to reach the desired end.  Everything I possessed or could control, savings, earnings, credit, comfort, pleasure, home itself have been placed upon the altar and immolated like Palissy's furniture to reach the blessing proposed.

One of these branches is the producing and man- ufacturing, the other one is the trading and speculative. A very little experience and reflection will enable one to de- termine the relative qualifications requisite for the represen- tatives of the two branches. While each should possess energy and vim, and be thoroughly imbued with the spirit of his work, the one may be of slower thought and tempera- ment than the other but must possess that dogged per- severance and invincible pertinacity of purpose that knows no surrender; he must also possess to a marked degree the virtue of patience which will enable him to watch the slow developing of experiment and which, if he does not reach success at one trial, will inspire him to look forward ENDENTRY  dent ladders on the platforms he has raised in order to pluck the fruit which he has planted, when it ripens. They presume to interpret my temporarily exhausted condition into ^lack of^ capacity because they do not comprehend the self devotion which inspires one to spend his last dollar and jeopardise his every interest to produce other than the most selfish results. There is no more justice in this course than in the attitude of the United States in robbing this people of their property, and I appeal to the highest authority God has on the Earth for protection against the possibility of anything  like such an outrage.   myself a few weeks ago are ringing in my ears because they so truly re-echo the sentiments of my heart, "Is it possible that we cannot do anything for the benefit of the people without the Bank corner"? My sympathy with this sentiment has rendered me somewhat indifferent about courting their influence. While I do not desire to antagonize them I am not willing to bow, just because they have got money, to men who have no higher concep- tion of a business than the sordid consideration of how much money there is in it for themselves.   ENDENTRY  to try again; and this in contradistinction to the more mer- curial disposition of the other, who, in the fever of excitement, is often too restless and impatient to wait longer than overnight to realize the execution and fruition of his plans. This latter character before he will take the trouble to examine into a producing or manufacturing, requires that it shall be led out before him all perfect and bedecked with ribbons like a prize beast at a fair, while the other character is willing to breed the calf, then tend it, nurture it &amp; watch it until it attains a condition of perfection worthy to compete for  willing to take some risk of obtaining possible or probable benefits to be developed by time, the other takes as little risk as possible and wants to get a hold on two thirds of his neighbour's jack-knife, while he gives a hold on only one third of his own.   ble the one, that of production and manufacture, is suscepti- ble of much greater good to a community than the other.

This expression showing the absence of interest in or comprehension of anything pertaining to the producing interests seemed to voice the sentiments of the whole committee and gave tone to their report which recommended a disastrous delay, whereas a few drops of the vivifying elixir, without which production &amp; manufacture would ever be a failure, would have inspired a searching inquiry, elicited attract- ive information, and engendered an interest that would have culminated in a thorough investigation and given us the fruition of the enterprise some time earlier.   to move lest it fail is the dry-rot of life.   the most valuable aids to the solid and tangible pros- ENDENTRY  THE UTAH SUGAR CO., P.O.

In the introduction of all new producing and manufacturing enterprises, no matter how skilfully managed nor what prestige they may bear upon their front, there is a feature of adventure or apparent risk which calls for nerve and good judgment and staying qualities born of determined motive. Between the inception and the consummation of any enterprise designed for the transformation of the crude elements into the practical and material necessaries and comforts of life, there exists a hiatus, in the bridging of which many a valuable and well-intentioned design dies the death of inanition, so many there are who use just enough fuel to make the water hot but withhold the last few bushels of coal necessary to raise the steam to a working pressure.

In the presence of so many implied doubts on the part of  my friends, it would appear self-willed and, perhaps, foolishly head- strong, on my part, to persist in an undertaking of so great conse- quence and magnitude, as the one concerning which I have written you. May I not intrude upon your time to lay before you, in brief,  some of the palpable reasons which have induced me to undertake  so great a labor?   of production that would relieve the over-burdened ranks of the  Farmers, and occupy their attention in some direction wherein they  would cease to compete against each other in the production of  Wheat.

The farming business opened up the most ready access to supply  their needs; and they thus, measurably ignorant of the business, be- came competitors against the legitimate farmers. Their lack of  skill obliged them to raise the crop most easily produced,—Wheat; and their necessities compelled them to be the first in the market with what they had to sell. Thus, the legitimate farmer was power- less in maintaining reasonable and paying prices for his product. And, so long as there was an excess of supply over demand, prices  ruled low and no one was well paid. Hence the necessity of opening  up some other branch of the industry upon which the farming labor  might be employed; in addition to this reason, there also appeared a still greater one: that a large number of our people are unem- ployed; that is, failed in securing continuous employment; and while many were not profitably employed, many others were not employed at  all, and many of our young men, who, failing to find work at home, are  forced to look for employment in Mining Camps and other places  away from the care of parents.   labors of the farming community and others unemployed, I noticed  that we paid out annually a very vast sum for the article of Sugar, ENDENTRY  Arthur Stayner City Re ENDENTRY         matters which I feel assured you will find of interest,  I earnestly ask the privilege of an interview at such early  date and  may permit.   possible the subject I wish to have the opportunity  of presenting   Your brother in the Gospel Arthur Stayner ENDENTRY    Arthur Stayner, Salt Lake City Rec ans Oct 1^1^0 1888        the Twelve Apostles     reconsider your action upon the matter of requesting Bro Fort Scott, Kansas.   man as Bro Howe on what he would see there would be of invaluable assistance in laying this important industry before the business men of the community, and his making his report to you and your giving per- mission to use it would really constitute all the responsibility that would be consequent upon the appoint- ment, unless the representations made by him should  influence you to take some  ration and direction of this truly great enterprise.

Our method in other denominations is to gather the statistics by conferences or presbyteries or associations. I understand that the Church of which you are president is divided into stakes.

I have prepared schedules for this purpose, a copy of which I enclose to you for your information, in order that you may see what is the scope of the inquiry. I may add that to the person who undertakes to gather the statistics of a stake I can furnish, inaddition to this schedule, all the necessa- ry materials for corresponding, if necessary, with congregations in his district.

I would not disturb your mind with these purp- lexing things, I am confident you are not aware of things which do really exist &amp; that you would not approve of them for if I believed otherwise I should regret coming, for I cannot believe that it is the will of God I should ^suffer^ just such things as thro this I may be called to suffer greater ones, I have, &amp; I do exspect to become a sharve with you not only in the  ENDENTRY  &amp; rainment, but also in the privations &amp;  hardships which you may be called in the  providence of God to pass through which  journeying to the place of our destination But, when on a certain day we were journey ing &amp; it had got be noon and I felt quite faint &amp; you had stopped, to feed your cattle, I waited  a good while to have some one introduce  the sating some bread &amp; milk but, the next day I thought I would not wait again, for I was sure it could not make any difference as one &amp;  another were getting milk to drink so I said I would eat a little break &amp; milk for I felt the need of it, so Miss King helped me to the same &amp; asked Phebe which she should get  the last nights milk or mornings, &amp;  she replied, the skim,d milk, I was  astonished, as I knew they had all as it were been drinking milk all the  morning &amp; new milk too, but I never  ENDENTRY  was truly hard that I must be denied the privilege of a little good milk &amp; I  said, why, you exspect I suppose your new milk eat or I should  it was better to have the poorest  drand, &amp; the best meat &amp; that for my part I had a peculiar preference  to new milk  Why said Miss K. this is good milk, I dipped it out  &amp; I ate it, but exspressed feelings  of not entire satisfaction &amp; Phebe  says, we have calculated for a general thing to use our nights milk first so  that we can get some cream from the  best I could not understand how they  could raise cream while the milk was in the waggon, so I enquired of her, &amp; I also knew that the new milk had  been eaten &amp; drank every after I came  here, &amp; she finally said, Why no, we  don't exspect to set our milk for butter in the day time, &amp; so it ended leaving  ENDENTRY    Giddings Linus - 3)   say, I was tried, a day or two after this becoming way faint before anyone spoke of  eating &amp; as you had stopped, I got some milk to eat, I helped your father to some also &amp;   (Hart Beaulah)   a dissatisfaction in Phebes mind on account of  the liberty taken, tho nothing was said  in regard to new milk or old milk for I think it  was mixed together, but while father &amp; I was eating something was said about her  eating some &amp; ^she^ replied that she had been waiting for others to get through, why said  I Phebe need you wait for me so long as  I bring my own dishes &amp; bread, she replied  that we could not all eat at once &amp; this I did not then, nor do I now comprehend,  the next thing that presented itself in regard to milk was that as Sarah had been ENDENTRY    laying on my mind in addition t what I have already exspressed to y I will further say, that altho I do no feel disposed to notice every little trivial occurrence which may, ha or shall, hereafter occur in a unusal manner, &amp; yet permit ^me^ to say, that  I do think I have not myself been treated in some respects according to  justice &amp; judgement since I have been  in your say that I do exspect so long as  remain with you to become a sharer in  all the varied sanes which a wiled  omnipotent hand shall see fit to call us  unto whether it be in adversity or prosperity, in privation &amp; want, or in a state of plenty. But I do feel that as you have taken as your Parents with also with the  intention of providing for us the  ENDENTRY  disposed to turn me off with a piece of old bread for supper which was so hard that  I would not give it he asked me just before to give him some). &amp; especially since I gave what I had the night  before to the family being enough for thier meals for my family &amp; it was very light, tender &amp; good too, &amp; Wilford, I did want it, tho, all the fuss I made about it, was, that I went to the  by &amp; helped myself to some new bread, saying  meantime, that I had ^no^ notion of accepting of such hard bread in exchange for that which  was tender &amp; good, &amp; now I will say, that I could not have done less than I did without being made  really afflicted with hard feelings such as I do not like to feel ENDENTRY  Sariah should should be called on to dip out milk for every  one who wanted  that I thought there might be ^*at the time^ some execpt- ions to that rule ^for, indeed I was wanting some^ with out destroying the order of the same for indeed I felt, at once that I should never be conformed to a rule like that, which living with my children &amp; especially when I was as competent to not only to dip out ^milk^ with as great carefulness as any one but also to make &amp; take enough  butter in quite as orderly a manner yet was fucrueted by Sahab, but I was at once that Phebe intended to suffer  to the rule as she said it would be of no use to establish such a rule unless it was closly adharied to by every individual, but for my part I felt that it might be necessary for the family in general, especially for men &amp; children at the particular ones were not subjugated &amp; now I will say to you that I have not practiced it all since the time of calling on Sarah for milk &amp; I will I ever of all ENDENTRY  father has formu   enou   considered it as unsaint like, &amp; in the next as unchild like to require me todoso, &amp; in the third place, I was sure that I should not enjoy anything in mind if I felt obliged to conform to a rule like this, I should feel it ^to^ be wrong &amp; only intly should have hard feelings  do not like to feel towards any friend &amp; besides, just look at the necessity of your Mother being conformed, or subject to such a rule, when the only time I should have occasion to call on Sarah is at night &amp; then I am almost surrounded with new Milk in our Tent every pan just alike except there should be one not quite as full as the rest, &amp; in this case, I am sure to know which it is without going to Sarah but now Wilford you will see at once that you need not much disestorment to see that your Mother is required to take a lower seat than your sevants, for she is denied privilege that ENDENTRY  Sariah that they do enjoy, for Sarah of course   forevery can have the frivilege of getting milk when &amp; where, &amp; as much as she pleases now I do think it a little curious, that when you do have such an abundance of milk &amp; every one who wishes can drink it when they please, &amp; as I do not drink any at all, but only want the privilege of eating a little with bread, at night as well as at noon, since itis the case, that Ido not take but very little supper, of course want a little on going to bed, a thing which I have preach -ed a good many years. when I had milk &amp; when I had not, a little of some thing else, I say, I do think it curious that I should be this restricted in regard to this privilege &amp; in a special manner as as I have eat but so very little butter since I have been journeying, &amp; I am sure that my family have not disposed of ENDENTRY  father has formerly made use himself, but, enough about the aitute, milk, &amp; I will leave this sub- ject by saying that I do concider it the most an accountable thing that Pheby, mind should be led to such a course of treatment towards me un- less it be a trade in her disposition for I can say in truth, that I came with all her friendly feelings towards her, which are necessary to treat one with every due isprest, &amp; I designed in my heart to be to her as a Mother, the same as to Cunice Savr, that I did not calculate, as she has a number of children, that I should ^not^ be able to assist in the taking case of children, neither did I think it necessary as she was well provided for with help, &amp; I cannot think Wilford that there was anything in my demeanour towards Phebe that could possibly be the occasion of such treatment as I have in many other instances (which I have not named) viewed from her hand for indeed there has been many things tho small in their nature which have been extremely mortisfying  ENDENTRY   The uncommeitating spirit manifested by Mis King in regard to cooking  think bear testimony to the degree of resect by which I am held, in her estimation ^th them^ &amp; now I ^&amp; family^ will say, that after all, as much as I sat by this article milk the principle manifested in the presence of strangers have wieghed more in my mind than all the rest, but another small thing I will just name which hurt my feelings at the time we had occasion to tarry over night away from our provisions a little before you came, Phebe, in reply to my saying I did not know what we should do in regard to supper, asked if I had not some bread, I told her I had a few biscuit she said we would take them &amp; they would make us some in the morning if I insisted on it.  The next day that night as we had not our bread baked for supp to &amp; Miss King had got hers done &amp; cooked I said to Phebe that I should like to get some of them for supper she says, will but as I turned to go into the tent where the bread was she enjoined there is a piece of old bread that ought to be eaten first!  I was struck at the tho ENDENTRY  to tuson me off with a piece of old bread for supper which was so hard that I would not give it to Wilford (as he asked me for some) a spicially since I gave what I had the night before to her family being enough for three heats for my family, &amp; it was very light, tender &amp; good, too.  &amp; I alsoways feel that good bread makes every thing good &amp; that which is poor, therewise &amp; Wilford I did want it, this all the first I made about it was, to go to the fan don by helped myself to some new bread , saying meanti- me, that I had no notion of accepting of such hard bread, in exchange fo that which was tender &amp; good,  &amp; now I will say that I would not have done less than I did without being miserably afflicted, with hard feelings such as I do not like to feel, Another thing I will State, which I think may be asample of thme is representation which have existed between us you will rcollect of milking a little one day  at noon for your Joseph &amp; I partook with him yaco, the manner in which Phebe  the thing to you, caused me to feel ashamed of myself, she says, Wilford, Mother, wanted a little new milk I could not avoid saying that Phebe designed to have some for Joseph &amp; I said ENDENTRY  beuting you been an entire stranger unto The uniommetating spirit manifested by Miss King in regard to cooking &amp; to does I think bear testimony to the degree of espect by which I am held in her estimation &amp;by them^ &amp; now I ^&amp; family^ will say, that after all, as much as I sat by this asticle milk the principle manifested in the presence of Strangers has wieghed more in my mind than all the rest, but another small thing I will just name which hurt my feelings at the time we had occasion to tarry overnight awy from our provisions a little before you came, Phebe, in reply to my saying I did not know what we should do in regard to supper, asked if I had not some bread, I  told her I had a few biscuit, she said we would take them &amp; they would make up some in the morning if I insisted on it.  The next day has night as we had not our breat baked for supp to er Miss King had got hers done &amp; cooled I said to Phebe that I should like to get some of them for supper she says, will but as I turned to go into the itent where the bread was she enjoin&amp; there was a piece of old bread that ought to be eaten first!  I was struck at the that  ENDENTRY  between me off with a piece of old bread for supper which was so hard that I would not give it to Wilford (as he asked me for some) acespecially since I gave what I had the night  before to the family being enough for three meals for my family, &amp; it was very light, tender &amp; good too, &amp; I always feel that good bread makes  every thing good &amp; that which is poor, the reverse, &amp; Wilford I did want it, the all the fuss I made about it was to go to the pan clon &amp;y helped myself to some new bread saying meanti- me that I had no notion of accepting of such hard bread, in exchange for that which was tender &amp; good, know I will say that I would not have done less than I did, without being miserably afflicted, with hard feelings such as I do not like to feel. Another thing I will State which I think may be a samplel of them is representations which have existed between us you will recollect of milking a little one da at noon for your Joseph &amp; I partook with him was the manner in which Phebe interdlived the thing to you, caused me to feel ashamed of myself she says Wilford Mother wanted a little new milk I could not avoid saying that Phebe designed to have some for Joseph &amp; I said  ENDENTRY  should they be at the trouble to milk some tho, I had no Idea of having any, &amp; Pheb says you can have some Mother, I thought her very good  but, did not think it fair her putting the  matter in such a light, for indeed it is not  my principle nor never was my disposition  to require such attentions, tho, I think there may have been some excatisons to make it  appear that I have been selfish, a trial which  I have never before been accused of &amp; it is my  opinion, that if you Wilford have any feelings in your breast, that I have  conduct or conversation, from the froth of  rectitude, or wisdom, since I have been in your midst, It must be ^either^ from a course of such  misrepresentations as was manifest in  regard to the milk or of a similar nature, or  perhaps in connections with some things of a grosser nature from others, or from the fact that you &amp; I differ in jugment in respect  to what is right &amp; wrong, you may perhaps think I lay too much stress upon the manner of Phebes speaking to you as she did about the   ENDENTRY  one moment &amp; concider what your views sould have been without an explanation, &amp; tho, the thing in itself concidered was small yet it is easy to be seen that great things might come from it, for instance, that shee  was really disposed to make it appear to your mind that your Mother was very  difficult, notional, &amp; selfish, what better  evidence could she want to present to your mind, than the fact, that your Mother  required the privilege of having a cow milked at noon, that she might be accom- modated with new &amp; warm milk, certainly there is no one but would concider it an unreason- able requirement. Well, did not the language Phe used, convey the Idea in full that I required this privilege, most certainly it did, but after all it could not be said in truth that I asked such a thing, altho, I said, to be sure after she told me of her intended to have some  milked for Joseph, that I should like some good warm milk very well, my- self - But one thing I will suggest, that   ENDENTRY      vis, that of having some rule, or some whatsaid, whereby I might know what, &amp; where, such provisions were that you  exspected me &amp; my family to share with  you in, for indeed I have thought strange that Phebe did not, (unless she had heard  you give the invitation,) just say, Mother  here is this, that &amp; the other perhaps some  beans, a little rice, Pork &amp;c, which we  shall exspect you to help yourselves to,  as you like, but nothing of this sort has been said to me at any time the   ections to have some cooked for her fami- ily, I felt in a particular manner as if I should like some to cook, but nothing was said, till a day or two I then to her that I should like some beans to cook also. She replied, you know where they are ENDENTRY  of the beard any way suffice it to say then I cooked some (soon after this ground there was rice on board by their making some pudding of it. but not one word had been said to me abut helping myself &amp; family, but I do think Wilford that it is me more than propper if you expect I wish your Parents to share with ^you^ in the comforts you have to give them a general invitation to help them set up &amp; that too in the presence of your family for indeed there is no one, but would feel delicate in my situation but feel delicate to have for things in the persence of strangers in a special manner but you ^may^ be as send that if Phebe had asked as great exciting ones taken me helpers to the comforts of life as she has to keep them from me. I should not have wanted for any thing I do think as you assay. to provide for your Parents on this occasion, that it is no more ^than^ propper I should have the privilege of having change of so great as have of the Meth as ENDENTRY  I have been used to having a little of the  top of the milk to put in my tea &amp; coffe bu now I have in some cases to use skimmed milk, but I learn that Phebe &amp; her girls use  cream &amp; I have took a very little when I could  get a chance, but I have to be as private as  murder, but it or I should get a great trimming, !!! now I shall hope never to  hear again daughter Eunice, blamed for  speaking against Phebe for she did not  till me half as much as I have exspere- enced, &amp; every word, she did tell me would  be the case has been more than fulfill- ed, &amp; she disclosed to me that she had never said one word to  nst, Phebe, except to those who were pres- ent, &amp; knew for themsef the meantrial- ment, she had received at times from her &amp; now, it is evident that all the stir that had  been made since over it at Nauvoo, has  been made through the same instrument- atity of misrepresentation that you got the  ENDENTRY  Bedfore I came here was full of remarks against the principles of the church &amp; that you could not nor would not have such things, well, I thought it rather strange that Betsay should exercise so little wisdome, but I determined to speak to her on the subject &amp; I did so but she seemed astonished, I said she could not remain ^any^ at first of one word being said on the subject, but finally she said she did recollect that ^on^ a certain occasion a few words was exchanged in some what of a  character, by way of argument which amounted to nothing as it were, but it was spoken openly in a more said or thought about it as she knew I was convienced that whoever was instrumental of making such illegible  pression on your mind was strangely out of the way, but duty calls me to you ^she also^ of the incident which took place yesterday morning between Phebe and Betsey, Phebe came in while we were all about dressing &amp; they as is very common was cleaning the bed after I was &amp; bring close by Betsey she happened to  ENDENTRY  onto Betseys bed or to her &amp; Betsey, says to her (as she afterwards informed me) I wish you would not throw your dirty cloaths onto me &amp; as I do not want besmeard things under my nose, always,  said she had often exspressed to Mary  &amp; she would care nothing about it but on this occasion Phebe being resent her grit was  stirred, &amp; she spoke very short &amp; harshly to Betsey &amp; threw spring, out to in of her being so part- icular tha no one might touch her things Betsey insisted that she had done no more than to tie up her bed for the sake of convin ience &amp; to keep it as desent as possibly &amp; also to have a plan to lay other things onto &amp; Phebe said, you will throw other peoples things about, but this Betsey denied a Phebe said she had been told so, Betsey then asked the girls if they had told her such things &amp; they all at one denied telling any such thing, but Betsey heard, Phebe sying to Mary you did tell me that Betsey threw off at a certain time some shitten clouths you put on her bed three times over but Mary said she could remember one such thing, of course the great accersation against Betsey was when the girls threw shitten cloaths on her bed, that she  ENDENTRY  feelings on regard to this subject is similar to mine viz  to keep our things orderly the better it will be for their company in general - more I do not know of but one thing that Phebs can with any perprinty bring up against me &amp; that is nothing at all in one sense, but one day, as little Phebe oders an too, I think come in to the Tent with some greasy rituals in their hands but Betseys bed was tied up &amp; any convinient to sit down on they took seats on it &amp; as she was absent I felt it duty to call them as I did that they shouldnot sit with their rituals on &amp; and Betseys bed, &amp; added, you should never sit down on other peoples bed, wondering that I was talking to children but just at that moment Phebe came in &amp; I can assure you that she took me to do at a great rate I told her that I was one of the last persons that ever practised any  trol with any ones comfort or happiness that I concidered on this occasion that I was talking to childre, but all did not do, but I do wonder if Phebe thinks that after all the children I have taken care of both of our own &amp; Br Ozuns ENDENTRY  health, as also the abundance of help she  has for the taking care of children, that I  came here with the exspectation of having an sort of care of her children, I have thoughtf a good while that if any of my sisters shoul die &amp; leave young children that I should not  feel it duty to do anything about taking car of them, but last of all, I must say that I  never in my whole life avoided viewed myself so Thankfully treated, as she treated me this morning, as the girls were going to wash  I told father to present his shirts, as I was not  able to do more than wash my own &amp; tho I might sometimes wash my night dress 2 shimms &amp; as for Betsey, I have never expected she would do my washing for she had not been able to do more than her own for a  good while past, I also had a sheet on my bed  which was got very dirty in the wet weather &amp;  sheet I spoke at being washed, &amp; Phebe hearing a the waggon sent for Mary &amp; told her they might  wash fathers cloaths, but no more  I went to the  carriage &amp; said to her, that there is a very dirty  sheet on my bed, which I was unable to wash, but she gave me understand no washing but father  would be done &amp; after saying I thought there was ple ENDENTRY  I replyed, that when she was at our house in  Farmington &amp; I had one wash woman, which came  once in two weeks to wash for me &amp; I had her do  your washing, Phebe replied, she did not do  my clothing, for I did it myself &amp; a great  deal more when I want able hardly, to sit up Phebe, said &amp;, you did not do your washing  at least not a great deal of it, you might have  done your childs, will you give me the lie  Mother  I said to you on the subject, for I told you that  you need not undertake to wash at all, that  Mrs Stone would do it tho if you were you might do your diapers, &amp; I do know that  Wilford heard me on some occasions tell you  not do do it, you might however done some part of it, but as for your doing the whole &amp; much more washing any of my cloaths  you never did it Phebe, she then comes up &amp;  in the presence of Miss King, says, &amp; besides  that, I had to take care of my child when I  want hardly able to get up, &amp; you never pretended  to take it up or take any notice of it good  heavens said I Phebe I was in a glorious good state  to be able to give special time to the taking  care of my child when I had been worn down  to the quick by being up nights &amp; upon a thro the daytime on account of Ex extreme ENDENTRY  I had quite a number in my family  to cook for ^ wait upon &amp; no soul to help me except as Wilford having some compas- sion on me &amp; some of the feelings of a child offered to wash my dishes for me once &amp; again while you was seated in the front chamber a working of muslin. but to sum it up I could hardly get a chance to put in ^a^ word edgeways,   I tell you what I think about Phebe &amp; mr Wilford &amp; feelings, such a spirit towards me as it evident she has a very bad ^one^ towards me, it is because that when we arrived at Eun with a babe of a week old, that I did not instead of helping her &amp; taking care of her babe when they were not able even to hire a nurse go into your room &amp; wait on her child- ren &amp; herself &amp; be ready to &amp;do anything that might come in my way &amp; let Eunice go &amp; her fam- ly, go but on the whole I more believe that the great mistery is contained in this that she is not pleased with our coming in the way have, I should like to manifest the the ifillegible &amp; tember of mind she exspressed to me two different reasons &amp; the control between own sentiments she said to me I told W I thought Mother was sick but she does more work than I could a day or two after she says I wish you would take a little more care &amp; take some burdens off from me ENDENTRY  I wish to communecate to you &amp; having no aportunity but by my pen I improve the same but I can assure you, it is not a esy delightful task to either speak, think, or write apon the subject which had for the most part lain heavy upon my mind,ever since my arrival at Nauvoo but more particularly since I joined the Camp of the Saints, most infidently do I believe  that that there is not a woman on this earth who can claim the aphellation of a wiffe whose feelings as   ed by a companion nor one who is  illegible neglectfast or an illegible kind  at munt than her who has the power to be recounted your Mother reither do I believe those is any one who has been called  ENDENTRY  I had quite a number in my family to cook for &amp; wait upon &amp; no doubt to help me except as Wilford having some comas- sion on me &amp; some of the feelings of a child offered to wash my dishes for me once &amp; again while you was seated in the ront chamber a working of mastin- but to sum it up I would hardly get a chane to put in a word edgeways,   Id tell you what I think about Phebe ^&amp; Wilford^ &amp; feelings such a spirit towards me as it evident she has a very bad ^one^ towards me, it is because that when we arrived at Eun with a babe of a week old, that I did not instead of helping her &amp; taking care of her babe when they were not able even to hire a nurse go into your room &amp; wait on her child- ren &amp; herself &amp; be ready to anything that might come in my way &amp; let Eunice go &amp; her fami- ly, goes but on the whole I once believe that the great mistery is contained in this that shirs not pleased with our coming in the way have, I should like to manifest the of illegible &amp; tember of mind she exsperssed to me illegible own sentiments she said to me I told W I thought Mother was sick but she does more waking but I could a day or two after she says I wish you would take a little more care &amp; take some burdens off from me  ENDENTRY  I wish to communicate to you &amp; having no  opportunity but by my pen, I improve the  same, but I can assure you, it is not a  very delightful task to either speak, think,  or write upon the subject which has for the  most part lain heavy upon my mind, ever since my arrival at Nauvoo but more  particularly since I joined the Camp of  the Saints, most confidently do I believe  that that there is not a woman on the  earth who can claim the aphellation of  a wife whose feelings are  susceptible of kindness or  by a companion, nor one who is  under more universally miserable   treatment than  honor to be recounted your Mother  neither do I believe there is any  one who has been called &amp; ever  ENDENTRY  the days of the ancient Apostly to labour with greater  for the duration of the sould of afirmnt to their deliverance from the reign- ing power of sin &amp; Satan, than has  your Fathers behalf &amp; I had thought, those seasons of opporti- tion on account of the same of which there shared in neat abundance  depenating since in again digee passed a way but I perceive a seerived of the same in a special manner since I joined this Camp which has tended to weigh down my spirits &amp; to cast a gloom over my journey to California, but whatever you may fel to impart this change in the mind of your Father unto any one else, I can say in truth that I know when it commands by what instrument illegible he limplion ENDENTRY  at the time we were looking for your arrival at Farmington &amp; began to fear you were Shipwricked, &amp; we both felt very anxious, but as you did not come your father said to me one day on what do you think we shall do if he should not come, (suming to feel a very different frame of mind than he had before) Why, said I, have no doubt but thier would be some way provided for us but I should feel it to be a great calamity whatever might become of us, but I percieved at once that your father had or was giving away to quite a new spirit from what he had for a long time previous, as he began to explict upon me for those things &amp; others, for which I was no more to blame than I was because you didnot come at the time appointed &amp; this spirit has continued to a greater or less degree till the present time. &amp; when we came to Nauvoo ENDENTRY  promote this undue &amp; unjust spirit, every word spoken by myself ever so hone stly was invested into a bughear &amp; become  a crime worthy of deep censure, &amp; since I joined the Camp, your father has treated  me with the greatest neglect, indifference,  &amp; hostility, so much as that he has hardly  given me a pleasant word &amp; besides in  one or two instances he has treated me  before company in the most unfeeling  &amp; unreasonable manner as in the case  of three evenings past, the one in which  I dissolved a part of a pill for susane &amp;

I find after being a member of this  Church fifty seven years this  month; that I am under the  necessity of asking assistance from the Church for my future support, I ask this favor of you in confidence, the more so; because  I have been promised repeatedly by Brother Brigham Young, who; the last time but one that he was south; sent for me, and told me, that he had bought a house in the city for me, and  that hereafter my family, should be provided for, that I, had suffered ENDENTRY  require me to suffer any more.

I have not lived in a house that was plastered in any part; since I came to the mountains, but  that does not matter much, as I am used to hardships of all kinds. I have never called on the Church for aid; until, the long sickness, and Death of Mr Lightner accompanied by a series of misfortunes compelled me to apply to Brother Taylor for assistance. Just before my Husband died, Brother Taylor allowed me two hundred Dollars a year during his life time, but intimated that he would incre^ase^ the amount at his death—he died two years ago—and left me in  debt over a hundred Dollars—a Jew has my note for $80 and I have not a Dollar to pay  on it—the rest of the debt is  paid. I have not received a cent since Brothers ^Taylors^ death. I have Aunt Gilbert to support, who; is  now in her Eighty-Eighth year of her age, and a cripple.

Sir JOHN THOMPSON continued his explanation of the clauses of the bill dealing with Mormons.   that they should apprehend what the attitude of the Government was with reference to the persons who had given birth to the legislative  clauses before them. They had heard vari- ous rumours and words of encouragement to a section of people called Mormons in the North-West. These words of encouragement seemed to him out of place, if their doctrines were what was represented. There were in Ontario certain small scattered communities of the Joseph Smith school, who, so far as he could ascertain, had proved themselves good emigrants and obeyed the laws. They were of a different class to those of the Latter Day Saints who had settled in the North-West. It was right to emphasize the fact of the diffi- culties that the State have had with the Utah Mormons, and that very strin- gent measures had to be adopted by the Republic against their practices. This was in consequence of the extreme solidarity and determination of the people to persist in concealing the legal evidence of their abominable practices. As far as one could judge, there was a disposition on a con- siderable part of these people to seek a more congenial soil than Utah. It seemed to him that the settlement in the North-West was such as to enable members on both sides to support the Minister of Justice to provide stringent laws against such polygamous practices. The settlement called upon them to give expressions of discouragement rather than approval of such a colony in their midst. He read from the will of Brigham Young, from which a glimpse, he said, was obtained of their marriage customs. Simple cohabitation, in accordance with the Mormon Church, seemed to be one of the principal, conditions of mar- riage. In the Judgement of Mr. Justice Ander- son, issued in 1889, he found that the belief of the Mormons was that their Church was the actual and veritable kingdom of God on earth, that this kingdom was both temporal and spiritual, that it would overthrow the United States, that polygamy was a com- mand of God, and that the Congress of the States had no right to pass any law antagon- istic to Mormonism, it was stated that the North-West Mormons did not live in a polygamous state, but it was stated that there was a suspicious disproportion of the sexes there. He had a letter from a friend in Utah, who was cognizant with the course of events transpiring there, and he told him that in some instances the Mormons who had gone to the North-West had not brought their own wives, but that in such cases had taken each a fresh young girl. (Laughter.) He did not think that their friends from the North-West should be eager to promote settlers of this description.  It was neither wholesome nor profitable. All that they could do was to put in opera- tion all the legal machinery they could for the discontinuance of these abominable practices. He thought they were bound to support the Minister of Justice in any reason- able attempt to stamp out this crime of polygamy. It should also be indicated in the clearest language that it was not words of encouragement but words of discourage- ment that this Parliament had for Mor- monism.   two or three of the leaders of the North- West Mormons visited Ottawa asking for concessions from the Government. He had one or two interviews with them. The ap- plications they made were not granted, but they stated most distinctly that they had no intention of practising the tenets of their faith in the settlement. They gave the Gov- ernment the most abundant assurance on that point. Since then there had been rumours that they had abandoned their promises. An effort had been made by the Government to ascertain if there was any foundation for these reports, and through his deputy he communicated with the leaders of the Mor- mons in the North-West for explanations. They replied, and stated emphatically that they were not practising polygamy, that they made a solemn promise when they went there and they were determined to keep it.   the concessions they wanted?   lowed to settle in communities in the hamlet system, that is that they could live together and live in the communal system.   these people is that they are being driven out of the States because laws are put in force against them. There is no reason to suppose that they will abandon their practices here. It is a serious question.     own country and settle here, apparently to carry out their abominable practices.

They left Utah because, as they alleged, they were hardly used generally and there was a prejudice against them. Therefore they sought refuge in Canada. Some of these people were British  subjects by birth. They were told distinctly that they must understand the people of Canada would be as firmly opposed to  polygamy as the United States were. They replied that they simply wanted a refuge  and were willing to submit to the law. They discussed the matter generally and argued with him the principles of Mormonism, but he told them there would be no leniency towards polygamy.   statement that the Mormons had entertained  a hope of perpetuating their institutions in Canada.     clauses rose and reported progress.
