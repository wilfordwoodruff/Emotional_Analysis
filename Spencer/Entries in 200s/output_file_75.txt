 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 451When men have faith, then they arerequired to repent of their sins and be baptized for the remission of sin.This is what Jesus Christ taught,and He set the example himself. Though He committed no sin, Hewent unto John the Baptist and de-manded baptism of him. John theBaptist said he was not worthy to doit. But Jesus said, "Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness." After be-ing baptized it is necessary that weshould have hands laid upon usby men holding the Holy Priesthood, for the reception of the Holy Ghost.Now, if you have the Holy Ghost with you—and every one ought tohave—I can say unto you that there is no greater gift, there is no greaterblessing, there is no greater testimo-ny given to any man on earth. Youmay have the administration of an-gels; you may see many miracles; you may see many wonders in theearth; but I claim that the gift of the Holy Ghost is the greatest gift that can be bestowed upon man. Itis by this power that we have per-formed that which we have. It isthis that sustains us through all thepersecutions, trials and tribulations that come upon us. We also havethe gifts of the Spirit among us. I can bear testimony that the sickhave been healed, the blind havebeen made to see, the deaf to hear and the lame to walk, and devils have been cast out, by the power ofGod. These gifts and graces havebeen with this people from the or-ganization of the Church until the present hour. There sits a man[pointing to Brother Philo Dibble ] who, fifty-five years ago, while in Jackson County, Missouri, was shot through the body because of his re-ligion. If it had not been for the power of God, which was manifest-ed in his behalf, he would have goneto the grave. Other men have beenin like circumstances. The Lord hastaken whom He pleased and when He pleased, and preserved in life those whom He would preserve, ac-cording to the counsel of His own will. I bear record that these gifts are enjoyed by this people, accordingto their faithfulness before God. If we lack these things, it is because we do not live our religion; for if wedo our duty before the Lord, those blessings will be with us.Brethren and sisters, the Lord hasset His hand, in fulfillment of thewords of the Prophet Daniel, to es-tablish His Kingdom once more and for the last time on the earth, and to prune His vineyard with a mighty pruning. He has called menand ordained them and sent them forth to prune the vineyard for the last time, before the judgments of God overtake the world. These princi-ples are true, and if we will do ourduty, the blessings of God will at-tend us. The Lord has set His hand to call forth His Church out of thewilderness. The world has been indarkness and error from the day that Jesus and His disciples died. TheLord took the Priesthood to Him-self. He left the Christian and theJewish world without the Gospel of Christ, without a solitary man who had power to administer in the or-dinances of the Gospel. These arethe truths of heaven, and I bear re-cord of them to all men, and youwill find that they are true whenyou go into the presence of God. Ifthe Lord ever fulfills His predictions,it is quite time that He began tohave a people on the earth who will acknowledge His name.  The timehas come when God is going to per-form His work. If you want toknow what is going to take place,read the Bible. Let the Christianworld read the Bible; they don't be-lieve the Book of Mormon or theDoctrine and Covenants. Let them see what the Revelator St. John saysis going to take place in the last days.Read of the opening of the seals, the pouring out of the plagues the turning of the rivers and the seas intoblood, and of the death and judge-ment that are going to overtake the world. John wrote these things as hewas moved upon by the Holy Ghost,and his words will come to pass. We are living in a great day. These mountains are filled with Lat-ter-day Saints, in fulfillment of the revelations of God. The Lordhas commenced this work, and Heis not going to leave it.  I warn all men of that. Zion is going to be built up. Zion is going to be establish-ed. Zion is going to be clothed withthe glory of God. And the Kingdomof God will be like the little stone cut out of the mountain with-out hands; it will fill the whole earth, and prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man.Brethren and sisters, this is my testimony. This is the religion that I believe in. Have not I a right to believe in it? I say I have. I sayto every Methodist, to every Catho-lic, to every Presbyterian, and to all,you have a right to your own belief.We have a little time to dwell herein the flesh. I shall soon be called to go into the presence of God,and I am willing to meet all theworld there with regard to my testi-mony. I know my testimony istrue. I know Joseph Smith's testi-mony is true. I know he sealed histestimony with his blood. It re-quired his blood, apparently, toseal this dispensation, as it did the blood of Jesus and the prophets ofold, to seal their dispensations.Brethren and sisters, I want to see you faithful. I want you to be saved in the Kingdom of God. I want to be saved, too. What is gold, what is silver, what is honor, whatis the glory of this world? It all per-ishes with the using. Where are theancient prophets and apostles? Theyhave fallen asleep. Where are thegenerations that have existed beforeus? They have gone to sleep. Ourforefathers are in the spirit world. I shall very soon follow them, I ex-pect. So will you. Our future des-tiny lies on the other side of thevail. When I die I want the priv-ilege of going where God my Heavenly Father is, and where Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, is—He who taught the doc-trines that Brother Cannon and I are teaching you today, and that the Elders of Israel have taught fromthe commencement of this work. I want to dwell with them, and withour people who have been true and faithful to God.  I believe God willsave all people, except the sons of perdition, in some glory. There isa glory of the sun; there is aglory of the moon, and a glory of the stars, as one star differeth fromanother star in glory, so is the resur-rection of the dead. All sects, all parties, all people, except those whoshed innocent blood or commit un-pardonable sin, will have a glory ac-cording to their condition and thelives they have lived on the earth.As Brother Cannon has said, Godoffers the Gospel to a generation, andif they reject that Gospel it willcost them dearly. It is a serious thing for any dispensation to rejectthe Gospel of Christ and to shed the blood of the prophets. What did itcost to shed the blood of the Savior? He came to His Father's house—the Jews. He brought the Gospel tothem, and warned them of the wrath to come. But they rejected the Gospel; they crucified Him andput Him to death. What did it cost them? Jesus told them himself what it would cost them. He said: "Andthey shall fall by the edge of thesword, and shall be led away cap-tive into all nations; and Jerusalemshall be trodden down by the Gen-tiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled." That yoke has been upon the Jewish nation until thepresent day, and it is not broken 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR. 445in the following language, striking his cane into the soil: 'No, sir; I am going to stop right here. I am going to build a city here. I am going to build a temple here, and I am going to build up a country here.' And by the help of God he lived to see all this fulfilled. He dedicated the corner-stone of the Salt Lake Temple, and dictated the building of the Temple up to the time of his death. He directed the building of St. George Temple, and he moved a great mountain to get a place to suit him upon which to erect the Manti Temple. He pointed out the place on which to build the Logan Temple, and he did a great deal toward its erection. He built the big Tabernacle in Salt Lake City, and he dictated to the achi-tects nearly all that is upon the Temple block. There is hardly a city ortown in Utah that was not laid out under his direction." I brought President Young into the valley in my carriage. This wasthe first time he had ever seen the place, except in vision, and as we cameround the bend where we could have a good view of the valley, he wished me to turn the side of the carriage so that he could have a better view, which I did, having a door opening on the side of the carriage. Afterviewing the valley awhile he said: 'That will do, drive on; this is the place. I have seen this valley before in vision.' President Young hadbeen sick for several days on the Weber River, and several of the Pioneers had gone ahead and cut the road through a quaking asp grove, and had formed a camp and commenced breaking ground, but it was so very dry that it was difficult to break it until it was watered. I arrived at the campat 11:30. It was a little northeast of where the Knutsford hotel now stands. I had in my carriage one bushel of potatoes, and I covenanted that I would not eat nor drink until the potatoes were planted in the earth.I fulfilled the covenant, getting some of the brethren to help me, and soonhad my potatoes planted. Other brethren also planted some, and from these few came all our Utah potatoes until the railroad was built." Although we were on Mexican soil we planted the American flag soon after our arrival here. We immediately went to work and as a protec-tion against Indians, surrounded a ten-acre plat on three sides with a ten-foot adobe wall—on the remaining side with log cabins. Immediately wehad to dig ditches and get water to our crops or nothing would havematured. With our surveyor's chain and compass President Young wentto work to lay out Salt Lake City just as we see it to-day, with its broad streets and sidewalks, in the midst of dry, barren sagebrush, with scarce a white man's house within a thousand miles of us. I assisted in all that work. Many of you who are before me have also labored and toiled tobuild and beautify this country and make it what it is to-day. You know what we have had to pass through in all this. But God has been with us.He has crowned our labors with success. He has blessed the land andmade it fruitful; and we have been able to surround ourselves with pleasant homes and many of the comforts of life. Therefore, I say, we have great cause to be thankful to our Father for the blessings we enjoy. God bless the aged fathers and mothers of Utah, They have performed a mighty work in this land. They have worked and toiled, and sought todo good in the earth, and they are worthy of respect and honor in their

Look at the trouble andsuffering the Jews endured in thegreat war against Jerusalem, under Titus. Twelve hundred thousandpeople were taken out of the gates [of] Jerusalem and fell by the famineand by the sword. A remnant wasscattered throughout the world, and remains in that condition today. At the present time they are persecutedin Russia, in Austria, in Germany,and in other nations of the earth.They will be persecuted until Christcomes, or near that time.It is the same in this generation, and in every generation in whichGod has had a people upon the earth.It costs something to shed the blood of righteous men.I say to the Latter-day Saints, doyour duty, honor God and remem-ber your covenants. I want theseyoung men and young women of Israel to honor God, to honor theirparents, and remember their pray-ers. This Kingdom has got to restupon your heads. The world do notbelieve these things; but their un-belief does not make the truths of God of none effect. Therefore, I have a right to urge these young men to qualify themselves and pre-pare themselves to take the places of their fathers, and to honor Godand be united.  United you stand,divided you fall. Union is that which God requires of us, as a peo-ple. I hope you will lay these thingsto heart. Read in the Bible and you will find that they are true, andthey will have their fulfillment. God bless you. Amen.

 90 THE DESERET NEWS.REMARKSOn the necessity of adhering to the Priesthoodin preference to science and art, by ElderWilford Woodruff, Bowery, Thursday, April9 1857.REPORTED BY J. V. LONGIt is a pleasure to me, and I presume it isto all the brethren who have lived in the midst of this people during the rise and progress of this Church and kingdom, to see the sons of the prophets stand before the people as they have this day and hear their words while bearing testimony of the work of God.I well rememember the time that our young brethren who have addressed us were called ontheir mssions, and they, in connection with br. Grant, br. Ellsworth and others met at my house one evening to receive their blessings under the hands of the twelve Apostles. When they had received their blessings they were called upon to speak their feelings, most of them I suppose, for the first time in their lives; true they had sat un-der the teachings of the servants of God from their infancy. When most of them had express-ed their feelings relative to going on a mission to England, br. Joseph A. Young said, "brethren I will tell you my feelings when I come home."We have heard from him since he came home, his feelings have been expressed much to our edification. That remark sounded well to me and truly it has been very edifying and interest-ing to me to hear the speeches which have been made by all the young brethren since they have returned, the spirit they manifest shows to me that the blessing and spirit of their fathers are with them, and I realize that the spirit of the Most High is in them, and that ere long they w[i]l[l] become mighty men in Israel, and will have to bear off this kingdom and shoulder the care and responsibility of it when their fathers are resting 
 REMARKSBy Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF Tabernacle, Tuesday Afternoon, April 8, 1862.(REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.)This Church of Jesus Christ has had a vast amount of teaching, especially of late. We have had a great deal of good counsel and instruction this conference; the truth has been simplified, doctrine elucidated and made plain to our understandings through the revela-tions of Jesus Christ, and I really feel that we have great cause to rejoice. There is one truth that becomes still more evident to my mind, and I think to the minds of this people generally, and that is the importance and necessity of our being governed and control-led day by day by the revelations of God. Now, we may take the Bible, the Book ofMormon and Doctrine and Covenants, and wemay read them through, and every other reve-lation that has been given to us, and they would scarcely be sufficient to guide us twenty-four hours. We have only an out-line of our duties written; we are to be guided by the living oracles. The ten com-mandments are very good, and the great and glorious principles pertaining to the redemp-tion of man, the revelations pertaining to events that are past and to the things of the mysterious and unborn future, and there are also many choice and precious things relatingto the redemption of man, to the present andfuture greatness of the saints; but where canwe find one revelation that tells us that we should raise three hundred teams, or twelve hundred yoke of cattle, to bring up the poor from the Missouri river. We have been in-formed by the revelations of the Lord Jesus Christ that there should be a Temple built in Jackson county; but has there been a revela-tion to tell us how long or how high it should be? No, we have got to be governed by the mind and will of God, and this must be appa-rent to this people; it shows itself more and more. President Young tells us that the living oracles should be our grade, that, in fact, we should have the living oracles withinus always. Every man and woman has the privilege of being baptized, but it is not the privilege of every man to lead the church. It is my privilege to have revelation to know truth from error, and I should also havepower to cast out devils and to heal the sick,if I magnify my calling; and not only these gifts, but tongues, interpretation of tongues and the spirit of prophecy, and of course thatis revelation.It is the privilege of every man and woman in this kingdom to enjoy the spirit of prophe-cy, which is the Spirit of God; and to the faithful it reveals such things as are necessary for their comfort and consolation, and to guide them in their daily duties.I can say that I rejoice before this people and before the Lord our God, in the great blessings which he has poured out upon us; I rejoice that he is carefully watching over his kingdom and people, and it is manifest unto us. There has never been a time when a doctrine has been presented to us by the ser-vants of God that has appeared new or myste-rious, but what the Spirit of God has been ready to bear testimony of the truth of the same. When there have been cases of contention toknow who was the biggest man, the Spirit of God has always made known who was in the wrong, and this is a great blessing unto us,one of the greatest that ever was given unto the children of men, to be able to discern the right from the wrong in all cases that maycome under our observation. We can perform this work that is given unto us to do, for we know how to take the first step, and then we gradually advance as we are inspired from one degree to another; and if we have thatportion of the Spirit of God which it is our privilege to enjoy, and magnify our calling, we shall have that testimony we ought to have within us when any new doctrine isbrought forth, or old doctrine more fully ex-plained. In this way we shall profit by the preaching of our brethren, and be able to treasure up the principles of eternal life, and we should be ready at all times to carry out the principles that are revealed to our Presi-dents and Bishops from time to time, as theyreceive the word of the Lord from the Presi-dent of the whole Church. For instance, a certain number of wagons and teams are called for, and we should understand thatwhenever a Bishop wants anything for the public good, that we should be on hand to do what is wanted. President Young requiresnothing but what the Lord requires of him and manifests unto him; and I know that if we carry out those principles that are brought forth by our President and leader, we shall be blessed in so doing.This is the way I view our position as a people upon the earth, in the dispensation of the fulness of times. We are truly engagedin a great and mighty work, one that is sus-tained by the Almighty. It is like the mus-tard seed which grows from a small particle to a large tree. The commencement of thischurch was very small, but it is now growing into a mighty kingdom. No matter what ourstation and callings are when those who are over us rise up and call upon us to do any-thing, we should be ever ready to respond; when, for instance, we are instructed to stop selling whisky, or drinking it, we ought to do it, and then our minds will be enlightened by partaking of the Spirit of God, and the spirit and power of our high and holy callings will rest upon us when we listen to that in-struction that is given, and carry it out. This kingdom has got to rise up and take its stand in majesty, in strength and power among the nations, and all that the Lord has promisedwill be realized.Our President has frequently told us that we cannot separate the temporal from thespiritual, but they must go hand in hand together, and so it is, and so must we act in reference to building up the Church and king-dom of God.We should foresee the evil, and then fore-seeing it we should hide ourselves, and pre-serve ourselves in purity and holiness. Our President has tried from the beginning to instruct us in these things, and we should listen to the counsel that is given unto us.You have all heard President Young give instructions to the Elders from time to time; and point out the course that we should pur-sue in order to sustain ourselves. We should all strive to so manage our grain as to turn itto the best account. We have had counsel in regard to this matter, but how slow we are to carry it out. I have sometimes marveled at the course that has been pursued in regard to the duties that devolve upon us.Let us lay these things to heart, and profitby those instructions, and if we do, we will bring forth fruit abundantly. Let us be of one heart and one mind, in all things.I rejoice to meet here in this conference with my brethren and sisters, and I esteem it as a great privilege. I have been associatedwith this church ever since the year 1833,and I have been looking over the Quorum of theTwelve, to-day, and reflecting that in our first acquaintance, we were mere boys together, while now, most of us are beginning to have gray locks. The time is passing rapidly along, and the purposes of the Lord are fasthastening forward. If we will do our duty Iknow that God will sustain us and bring usoff conquerors; and he will open the way whereby we can be delivered from our ene-mies, and there will be room for us to spread out. The Gospel of Jesus Christ will spread and do good, and it will prove a blessing to the children of men. The Almighty requires his servants to maintain their integrity in righteousness and truth. We are called upon to build a temple to the name of the God ofIsrael, and let us try to do our duty; let us lay these things to heart, and return home from this conference refreshed with the Spirit of the Lord, and let us do those things that are of benefit to us, and the settlements wherewe live.God is merciful to us, and if we do our duty, we shall be blessed. We have been informed that the heavens are full of blessings for the faithful. We have not yet arrived at the ful-ness, but we are progressing in the great work of the dispensation of the fulness of times; and I pray that the Almighty will give us power to overcome and do his will, which I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ:Amen. 
 THE DESERET NEWS. AP[RIL] 11DESERET NEWS WEEKLY.TRUTH AND LIBERTY.PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BYTHE DESERET NEWS COMPANY.CHARLES W. PENROSE, EDITOR.WEDNESDAY, APRIL 11, 1883.FIFTY-THIRD ANNUALCONFERENCE.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFSaid we need the spirit of the Lord in every capacity we are calledto act in, whether in preaching oradministering in the ordinances of the Gospel. Governments which are a benefit to mankind, acknowl-edged and protected the rights of their citizens. Men are recognized in their lauded possessions. Why should not the rights of God who is the Creator of all be acknowledged? There have been some of His children who have been willing toacknowledge the rule of God, butsuch cases have been comparativelyfew. Many wars were fought priorto the supremacy of Rome, for the political power, but since that timerivers of blood have been shed in the name of religion. The Lord hasraised up many men to accomplish His purposes, though they them-selves might not have been awareof this. Even the warriors of the ages have been raised up by Him. When a people became wicked and corrupt, the Lord chastised them.This has been particularly illustrat-ed in the people whom the Lord has chosen as His own, kingdoms having been raised up to chastise His people for their transgressions. Then the Lord smote those who had afflicted His people in their turn.There never have been as many im-portant revelations given at any pre-vious time as in our day; all the keys and blessings of every dispen-sation have been restored through the Prophet Joseph, who was a lit-eral descendant of that Joseph who was sold into Egypt. Many of the Saints now living were personally acquainted with Joseph Smith, and can testify to the truth of his testimony and the validity of hiscalling. The setting up of this king-dom and its ultimate triumph wereshown in a dream to Nebuchadnez-zar, and the interpretation wasgiven to Daniel. We are living inthe time referred to, and there never was a kingdom of as great im-portance as the one we are now lab-oring to establish. Joseph Smith labored in the ministry fourteen years, and received during that time all the keys, ordinances and Priest-hood that have ever been upon the earth, and then, after passing faith-fully through a life of trial and per-secution for the Gospel's sake, he sealed his testimony with his blood,but he left the Church, the King-dom, the Zion of God, and the au-thority to continue the work he be-gan. The principles of good and evil are placed before us that wemay choose which we prefer. Butwe should realize that God and His power are greater than Satan andthe power of evil. God will estab-lish His kingdom and will accom-plish all that has been predicted bythe holy prophets. God did not create this earth and people it forthe Devil to possess and rule over.He will build up His own kingdomand redeem Israel, the Jews, and His Saints. It requires a great dealof faith and labor on the part ofthose whom the Lord has raised up and gathered here to accomplishthis, but God has raised up and will raise up men and peopleto accomplish His work. Men were known and called to positions ofprominence. The Saints are of Eph-raim and are called to build up thelatter-day Zion. Though there seemed to be a scarcity of those who were on the Lord's side, yet whenthe Gospel was sent forth it attract-ed the honest from all nations. From the beginning this work has con-tinued to grow and it becomes moreand more difficult for the wicked to prevail as time passes. Brother Joseph F. Smith has remarked, the only time Satan had any chance tooverturn this work was on the dayit was organized. This kingdom had been set up never more to be throwndown, but will continue to progress until Zion shall be built up and become the glory and beauty of the whole earth. The Saints have been tried and proven even unto death, and if they are no willing to do thisthey will not be worthy to associatewith those who made these sacri-fices anciently. Jesus laid down His life for the truth, His Apostleswith one exception died violent deaths. Many of this people have lost their lives in this cause. He is satisfied with their integrityin this regard. Nor do i believe that this people will be required to shed the blood of the wicked, but the Lord will fight our battles and cause the wicked to slay the wicked, that the hands of this people maynot be stained with the blood of their fellowmen, but the [S]aints will go forth and labor in the Tem-ples. Ever since the principle ofpatriarchal marriage has been published to the world this peoplehave continued to prevail, and if wewill keep the commandments of God He will take care of us. All ofthe laws and ordinances of the Gos-pel are eternal in their nature and all the righteous acts of the HolyPriesthood are recognized in heaven.We should be careful how we use ourpositions. We should not complainof a man called to preside over us.While God sustains him I am wil-ling to do so. I can assure theSaints of one thing -- that the Lordwill not allow any man who pre-sides over this Church to lead thispeople astray. I know that God is with President Taylor and his coun-selors, and is leading them right. I would sustain a man in any positionno matter what his youth or age justas long as the Lord sustains him. There is more union among theleading authorities now than therewas in our early history and thisprinciple is spreading abroad. Weshould sustain those over us in every position, and all be careful to sus-tain each other. The powers of thePriesthood can only be exercised inrighteousness and cannot be used to pull down or oppress our brethren.This has been illustrated among this people in times that are past. We must beware of jealousy andprejudice. We should be careful toobserve the laws and command-ments of God. Let us labor in thetemples for the redemption of the living and dead, let us avoid bicker-ings and fault finding. Let us keep God's commandments, pay our tith-ing and perform all our duties. Letus remember our prayers, for they as-cend into the ears of the Lord, andhe will be with this people and they will accomplish all that has been prophesied concerning them. Thosewho were the pioneers in this causeare passing away, but others are be-ing raised up to fill their places. I feel to warn all people to beware of they way they deal with this people; for those who rise upagainst them shall not prevail, but will [be] broken and scattered, whileZion will roll forth and fill the whole earth. It therefore behoovesus to observe all the laws and or-dinances of the Gospel, and theLord will not forget His promises. We will build these temples and complete them and attend to the work to be done therein, fill up these vallies of the mountains and attend to the duties required of us.We are making a record and willhave to meet it, when we go to the other side of the veil. May God help us to be faithful and true tothe end. 
 REMARKSBy Elder W. Woodruff, delivered in the Bowery,Great Salt Lake City, April 7, 1867.[REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS ]I shall call the attention of that por-tion of the House of Israel who are present, to the text which was given usat the beginning of this Conference,"Be ye of one heart and of one mind." This is a very good text, and one that is of great importance to this people. As was quoted this morning, Jesus said if ye are not one ye are not mine. Thisprinciple has been given to us by com-mandment and revelation. "Mormon-ism" is not a fable neither is it a Yan-kee trick got up to deceive this genera-tion; but it is a living fact, a truth which God and the angels in heavenknow, and which many people on earth understand.The principles which have beentaught to us since the commencementof this Conference are very importantfor us to understand, and to carry outin our lives. This is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Ithas been established by the command-ment of God; and it is composed of thehonest-in-heart, the meek of the earth,out of all sects, parties, denominations and nations. This body of people, or church, has got to build up the Zion ofGod in the last days; and this work cannot be accomplished upon any other principle than that of our being unitedtogether as the heart of one man.Everywhere upon the face of the earth we can see what the effect of dis-union is. The more that nations, com-munities, families, or bodies of peoplein any capacity under heaven, are divi-ded, the less power they possess to carry out any purpose or principle imagin-able; and the more union they possess, whether in a legislative or any other capacity, the more power they have to accomplish what they desire. We can see that the people of the world are be-coming more and more divided every day, and the evils resulting therefrom are everywhere apparent. We are call-ed to build up Zion, and we can notbuild it up unless we are united; and in that union we have got to carry out the commandments of God unto us; and we have got to obey those who are set to lead and guide the affairs of the King-dom of God.There have been principles presentedbefore us and counsel given during this Conference which are of vast impor-tance to this people. There are many positions that we as a people have to occupy, and many branches of business to which we have to attend, not only of a spiritual but also of a temporal ma-ture. Jesus said to the Jews you pay tithes of mint, anise, and cummin, but you neglect the weightier matters of the law, and they, as well as your tithing,are required at your hands. So it iswith us. We are one of heart and mindas it regards faith, repentance, baptism, or the first principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ; but the same unity must exist in our midst in all our temporal labours—in building temples, taberna-cles, cities, towns, villages, canals, cul-tivating the earth or any other labor,if we ever accomplish the object forwhich we have been raised up. Nopeople, unless they are united together,can ever build up Zion and establish the Kingdom of God on the earth.We have been taught the Word of Wisdom. It was given to us manyyears ago, and the Lord said it was ap-plicable to the weakest Saint. Very few of us have kept the Word of Wis-dom; but I have no doubt that if thecounsel of President Young were carriedout it would save the people of this Territory a million of dollars annually.I feel that we ought to put these things into practice. We ought to unite to-gether in all matters required of us in order to carry out the purposes of the Lord our God. The people are able todo it if they feel disposed. Why, Bish-op Hardy told me here this morningthat he had laid aside his tobacco; hehas loved it almost ever since he wasborn; and if he can leave it off everyman in Israel ought to be able to do it.It was said to-day that whisky drink-ing makes fools of men; it does. Its effects are much worse than they used to be, for the liquor made now-a-dayscontains so much strychnine and arse-nic that it is enough to kill anybody,and unless those who use it do lay it aside many will die. Lay aside whisky,tobocco, tea and coffee, and use none of them unless it be as a medicine. We can all do it, and there is not a man orwoman in Israel, with any faith in thiswork, but is required to do so.This little mustard seed here around this bowery, which has sprung up in the valleys of the monntains, has eithergot to grow and progress and become a great tree in whose branches the fowls of the air can lodge, or it must stop growing altogether. We have either to build up Zion in its beauty, power and glory, to the order which hasbeen received by the servants of God, or else give it up. We must do one or the other. If we do this we must advance,and whatever God requires at our handswe must carry out.I know the world oppose us because we are united; they say we are governedby one man. I would to God that all Is-rael would obey the voice of one man as the heavens obey the voice of God. Then we would have power to build up Zion and to obtain all things necessaryfor us before the Lord. We have cometo this. There is no division among usso far as the principles of our religion are concerned; it is in relation to somethings the world call temporal that we are not one. How are you going tobuild up Zion? In the hearts of the people? Why you could not get Zioninto the heart of any man, not even in-to that tabernacle; and I never saw aman in my life as big as that; and Ihope we shall never see the day when we will have a house big enough to hold Israel, for I trust they will be too nu-merous for any house we can build. We have to build up Zion, a temporal work here upon the face of the earth,and we have got to establish righteous-ness and truth. When I say a temporal work I speak of temporal things. TheZion of our God can not be built up in the hearts of men alone. We have to build up temples and cities, and the earth has to become sanctified and to be made holy by the children of God who will dwell upon it; and to do this we mustbe united together.I do not wish to preach a long sermon,but I feel that we ought to lay hold andcarry out the counsel that has been giv-en to us at this Conference. If we lay aside these things that do us no good, as has been already said, we will be bet-ter off, have more unity, have power togather and feed the poor, to send theelders abroad and to do a great deal of good with the means that we have saved,instead of squandering it upon thosethings that are injurious to us and dis-pleasing in the sight of God.Brethren and sisters, let us lay these things to heart, and be united in doing all the good we can in our day and gen-eration. We have the right to do good,but not evil. The principles of the gos-pel of Jesus Christ which have been revealed in our day are the power ofGod unto salvation to all that believe,both Jew and gentile, in this age of the world as well as any other; and in-asmuch as we will be united in carrying out the counsel we have received, we can overcome every evil that lies in our path, build up the Zion of God, and place ourselves in a position that wemay be saved therein; which may God grant, for Christ's sake. Amen.

 character that we are establishing, not to permit these infamous state-ments—either made by design or through ignorance—to pass out amongthe people of this nation without a flat and emphatic contradiction. (Ap-plause.) We are enjoined by the spirit and letter of this revelation to saythat these things are false; that they are untrue in every particular; andfurther, we should say to the people of the United States that we claimthe right to be heard upon this subject; that we have been lied aboutlong enough; that we have been misrepresented to our injury and with-out protest as long as we intend to be. I conclude my remarks with the closing words of the resolution, "And may God defend the right," for Ibelieve He will. (Prolonged applause and a chorus of voices: "Amen.")The preamble and resolutions were unanimously adopted by the congre-gation raising the right hand and shouting "Aye."Hon. John T. Caine read the followingDECLARATION BY THE FIRST PRESIDENCY OF THE CHURCH:Concerning the official report of the Utah Commission made to the Secretary of the Interior, in which they allege, "During the past year, notwithstanding the 'manifesto,' reports have been received by the Com-mission of eighteen male persons who, with an equal number of females, are believed to have entered into polygamous marriages during the year," we have to say it is utterly without foundation in truth. We repeat in the most solemn manner the declaration made by President Wilford Woodruff at our General Conference held last October, that there have been no plural marriages solemnized during the period named.Polygamy or plural marriage has not been taught, neither has there been given permission to any person to enter into its practice, but on the con-trary, it has been strictly forbidden.WILFORD WOODRUFF, GEORGE Q. CANNON, JOSEPH F. SMITH,First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Apostle Moses Thatcher moved that we receive, endorse and adopt as true the statement of the Presidency.Unanimously adopted.Hon. John T.

XLVIANNUAL CONFERENCE.The services of the Conference werecontinued this morning in the upperroom of the Temple.The Tabernacle choir sang the an-them:Let all Israel join and sing. (Music by Joseph J. Daynes; choir-isters led by Evan Stephens.)PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFMade brief appropriate remarks and then offered theDEDICATORY PRAYER,as follows:Our Father in heaven, thou who hastcreated the heavens and the earth, and all things that are therein; thou most glorious One, perfect in mercy, love and truth, we, thy children, come this day before thee, and in this house which we have built to thy most holy name, hum-bly plead the atoning blood of thine Only Begotten Son, that our sins may be remembered no more against us for-ever, but that our prayers may ascendunto thee and have free access to thythrone, that we may be heard in thy holy habitation. And may it graciously please thee to hearken unto our peti-tions, answer them according to thine infinite wisdom and love, and grant that the blessings which we seek may be bestowed upon us, even a hundred fold, inasmuch as we seek with purity of heart and fulness of purpose to do thy will and glorify thy name.We thank thee, O thou Great Elo-heim, that thou didst raise up thy ser-vant, Joseph Smith, through the loins of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and made him a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, and through the assistance and administra-tions of angels from heaven, thou didst enable him to bring forth the Book of Mormon—the stick of Joseph, in the hand of Ephraim,—in fulfillment of theprophecies of Isaiah and other Prophets,which record has been translated and published in many languages. We alsothank thee, our Father in heaven, thatthou didst inspire thy servant and givehim power on the earth to organize thy Church in this goodly land, in all its fulness, power, and glory, with Apostles, Prophets, Pastors, and Teachers, withall the gifts and graces belonging there-to, and all this by the power of theAaronic and Melchisedec Priesthood, which thou didst bestow upon him by the administration of holy angels, who held that Priesthood in the days of theSavior. We thank thee, our God, thatthou didst enable thy servant Joseph to build two temples, in which ordinances were administered for the living and the dead; that he also lived to send the Gospel to the nations of the earth andto the islands of the sea, and labored exceedingly until he was martyred for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.We also thank thee, O our Father in heaven, that thou didst raise up thy servant Brigham Young, who held the keys of thy Priesthood on the earth for many years, and who led thy people tothese valleys of the mountains, and laid the corner stone of this great Temple and dedicated it unto thee, and who did direct the building of three other tem-ples in these Rocky Mountains which have been dedicated unto thy holy name, in which temples many thousandsof the living have been blessed and the dead redeemed.Our Father in heaven, we are alsothankful to thee for thy servant JohnTaylor, who followed in the footsteps of thy servant Brigham, until he laid down his life in exile.Thou hast called thy servants Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon, andJoseph F. Smith, to hold the keys of the Presidency and Priesthood this day, and for these shepherds of thy flock we feel to give thee thanksgiving and praise. Thy servant Wilford is bound to acknowledge thy hand, O Father, in the preservation of his life from the hourof his birth to the present day. Nothing but thy power could have preserved him through that which he has passed during the eighty-six years that thou hast grant-ed him life on the earth.For the raising up of the Twelve Apostles, we also thank Thee, our God,and for the perfect union which exists among us.We thank thee, O Lord, for the perfect organizations of thy Church as they exist at the present time.O Lord, we regard with intense and indescribable feelings the completion of this sacred house. Deign to accept this the fourth temple which thy covenant children have been assisted by thee in erecting in these mountains. In past ages thou didst inspire with thy HolySpirit thy servants, the Prophets, to speak of a time in the latter days when the mountain of the Lord's house should be established in the top of the moun-tains and should be exalted above thehills. We thank thee that we have hadthe glorious opportunity of contributingto the fulfillment of these visions ofthine ancient seers, and that thou hastcondescended to permit us to take partin the great work. And as this portion of thy servants' words has thus so mar-velously been brought to pass, we pray thee, with increased faith and renewed hope, that all their words with regard tothy great work in gathering thine Israel and building up thy kingdom on earthin the last days may be as amply fulfilled,and that, O Lord, speedily.We come before thee with joy and thanksgiving, with spirits jubilant and hearts filled with praise, that thou hast permitted us to see this day for which,during these forty years, we have hoped,and toiled, and prayed, when we can dedicate unto thee this house which we have built to thy most glorious name. One year ago we set the capstone with shouts of Hosanna to God and theLamb. And today we dedicate the whole unto thee, with all that pertains unto it, that it may be holy in thy sight; that it may be a house of prayer, a house of praise and of worship; that thy glory may rest upon it, that thy holy presencemay be continually in it; that it may bethe abode of thy Well-Beloved Son, ourSavior; that the angels who stand before thy face may be the hallowed messengers who shall visit it, bearing to us thy wishes and thy will, that it may be sanc-tified and consecrated in all its partsholy unto thee, the God of Israel, the Almighty Ruler of mankind. And we pray thee that all people who may enterupon the threshold of this, thine house, may feel thy power and be constrained[t]o acknowledge that thou hast sanctified it, that it is thy house, a place of thy holiness.We pray thee, Heavenly Father, to accept this building in all its parts from foundation to capstone, with the statue that is on the latter placed, and all the finials and other ornaments that adorn its exterior. We pray thee to bless, that they decay not, all the walls, partitions, floors, ceilings, roofs and bridging, the elevators, stairways, railings, and steps, the frames, doors, windows, and other openings, all things connected with thelighting, heating and sanitary apparatus,the boilers, engines, and dynamos, the connecting pipes and wires, the lamps and burners, and all utensils, furnitureand articles used in or connected with the holy ordinances administered in thishouse, the veils and the altars, the baptismal font and the oxen on which it rests, and all that pertains thereto, the baths, washstands and basins.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.REMARKSMade at the General Conference ofChurch, in the Tabernacle, SaltLake City, Sunday, October 4th,1896, byPREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.-[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-If I ever felt thankful in my life for anything, I do this morning that I am alive, that I stand in the flesh and have again the privilege of assembling in conference. I am thankful that I have the privilege of meeting in this capacity Prophets, Patriarchs, Apostles, Elders and Latter-day Saints. For the sixty-three years of the sixty-six since the organization of the Church I have been blessed to meet, when at home, with the general conferences of the Church. I have listened to the testimony of Pro-phets and Apostles and Elders of Israel, ncluding that good and great man, the Prophet Joseph Smith, whom God raised up and appointed from before the foundation of the world to stand in the flesh in the latter days and organize the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to prepare the way for the com-ing of the Son of Man, to warn the whole world as far as doors should be opened, and to prepare for the great events to transpire in the generation in which we live. The testimony of the Prophet Joseph has been a strong one concerning the great and last dispensa-tion of God to man on the earth. Up-wards of eighteen hundred years have rolled away since the death of the Savior of the world and His Apostles, and the God of heaven knows what it cost the Jewish nation to shed the blood of their Savior and their Shiloh, and the blood of the Apostles. The blood of the Lord's anointed which was shed by that nation in that day cost more than the human family can comprehend. Well might the Savior say, while pass-ing through that ignominious death upon the cross, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." [##Luke 23:34##] Truly, they knew not what they did; but the effect of it has been manifest with the house of Israel now for eighteen hun-dred years, and the end is not yet. So I will say with regard to the Gentiles The God of heaven knows what it will cost them for shedding the blood of the Prophet of God and his brother, and the Apostles and brethren who laid down their lives for the word of God and testimony of Jesus Christ. It costs s[o]mething to shed righteous blood. And the Gentiles have not got eighteen hundred years before them in which to pay the debt. The words of the Lord have got to be fulfilled upon them in the day and generation in which these holy men have been slain.I refer to these things because I know not how long I may have the privilege of bearing my testimony of the Gospel of Christ on the earth. The revelations that are in the Bible, the predictions of the Patriarchs and Prophets who saw by vision and revelation the last dis-pensation and fullness of times, plainly tell us what is to come to pass. The ##Isaiah 49|49th chapter of Isaiah## is having its fulfillment, as are the sayings of the Patri-archs and Prophets as laid down in the records of divine truth. And they will be rapid in their fulfillment. I have often said in my teachings, if the world want to know what is coming to pass, let them read the revelations of St. John. Read of the judgments of God that are going to overtake the world in the last dispensation. Read the papers and see what is taking place in our own nation and in the nations of the earth, and what does it all mean? It means the commencement of the fulfillment of what the Prophets of God have predict-ed. In the Doctrine and Covenants there are many revelations given through the mouth of the Prophet of God; these revelations will all have their fulfillment, as the Lord lives, and no power can hinder it. In one of the revelations the Lord told Joseph Smith:Behold, verily I say unto you, the angels are crying unto the Lord day and night, who are ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the fields;But the Lord saith unto them, pluck not up the tares while the blade is yet tender, (for verily your faith is weak,) lest you destroy the wheat also.Therefore let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest is fully ripe, then ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares, and after the gathering of the wheat, be-hold and lo! the tares are bound in bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned. [##Doctrine and Covenants 86:5-7##]I want to bear testimony to this con-gregation, and to the heavens and the earth, that the day is come when those angels are privileged to go forth and commence their work. They are laboring in the United States of America; they are laboring among the nations of the earth; and they will continue. These things are at our doors, and neither you nor I can hinder them. We need not marvel or wonder at anything that is transpiring in the earth. The world do not comprehend the revela-tions of God. They did not in the days of the Jews; yet all that the Prophets had spoken concerning them came to pass. So in our day, these things will come to pass. I heard the Prophet Joseph bear his testimony to these events that would transpire in the earth. I have had the privilege during my life to see the beginning of the fulfillment of the words of the Prophet of God unto the inhabitants of the earth. He lived but a short time; but the Savior's life was much shorter after entering the ministry. He was put to death, as were all His Apostles, excepting John; and that blood has been paid for as far as time would admit. We cannot draw a veil over the events that await this generation. No man that is inspired by the Spirit and power of God can close his ears, his eyes or his lips to these things. I do not know that I shall live to see much more; it is not likely that I shall; but I have lived to see the commencement in the earth. I have lived to see the words of the Pro-phet of God being fulfilled concerning Zion, concerning the mountains of Israel, and the gathering together of the Lord's people to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man. We have been led to these mountains in fulfillment of revela-tion. We have laid a foundation for the gathering of the House of Israel and the Saints of the living God. I hope that we as a people may com-prehend these things. I have listened to the testimony, not only of the Pro-phet of God, but also of many of the Apostles. I remember very well the last charge that Joseph gave to the Apostles. We had as little idea that he was going from us as the Apostles of the Savior did that He was going to be taken from them. Joseph talked with us as plainly as did the Savior to His Apostles, but we did not understand that he was about to depart from us any more than the Apostles understood the Savior. Now, I have heard of other parties rising up and pretending that the Prophet Joseph Smith gave unto them a charge to lead and direct the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I want to say that it is false; there is not a word of truth in it. When he delivered that charge to the Apostles he was filled with the power of God. His face was clear as amber, and the room was filled with the Spirit of God, like the holy fire. In his address he told us that he had received at the hands of the Almighty God all the keys, and powers, and priesthood, and ordinances and gifts belonging to the dispensation in which we lived. "Now," says he, "I have sealed all these blessings upon your heads, upon you Apostles of the Lamb of God, who have been chosen to bear off this Church and kingdom on the earth;" and after making this solemn proclamation to us, he said, "Now, you have got to round up your shoulders and bear off this kingdom, or you will be damned." I never shall forget that. All of those Apostles today are in the spirit world, excepting myself, and they know that what he said is true; and

 selves, and all books, documents, and papers appertaining to the office of therecorder, likewise the library with all the books, maps, instruments, etc., that may belong thereto. We also present before thee, for thine acceptance, all the additions and buildings not forming a part of the main edifice, but being ap-pendages thereto; and we pray thee to bless all the furniture, seats, cushions,curtains, hangings, locks and fasteningsand multitudinous other appliances and appurtenances found in and belonging to this Temple and its annexes, with allthe work of ornamentation thereon, the painting and plastering, the gilding and bronzing, the fine work in wood and metal of every kind, the embroideryand needlework, the pictures and stat-uary, the carved work and canopies.Also the materials of which the build-ings and their contents are made or composed—the rock, lime, mortar andplaster, the timbers and lath, the woodof various trees, the gold and silver, thebrass and iron, and all other metals, thesilk, wool, and cotton, the skins andfurs, the glass, china and precious stones,all these and all else herein we humblypresent for thine acceptance and sancti-fying blessing.Our Father in heaven, we present before thee the altars which we have prepared for thy servants and hand-maidens to receive their sealing bless-ings. We dedicate them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, unto thy mostholy name, and we ask thee to sanctifythese altars that those who come untothem may feel the power of the Holy Ghost resting upon them, and realizethe sacredness of the covenants they enter into. And we pray that our cove-nants and contracts which we make withthee and with each other may be di-rected by thy Holy Spirit, be sacredly kept by us, and accepted by thee, and that all the blessings pronounced may be realized, by all thy Saints who come to these altars, in the morning of the resurrection of the just.O Lord, we pray thee to bless and sanctify the whole of this block or pieceof ground on which these buildingsstand, with the surrounding walls and fences, the walks, paths, and ornamentalbeds, also the trees, plants, flowers and shrubbery that grow in its soil; maythey bloom and blossom and become exceedingly beautiful and fragrant; andmay thy Spirit dwell in the midst thereof, that this plot of ground may be a place of rest and peace, for holy meditation and inspired thought.Preserve these buildings, we beseech thee, from injury or destruction by flood or fire; from the rage of the elements, the shafts of the vivid lightning, the overwhelming blasts of the hurricane, the flames of consuming fire, and the upheavals of the earthquake, O Lord, protect them.Bless, we pray thee, Heavenly Father,all who may be workers in this house. Remember continually thy servant who shall be appointed to preside within itswall, endow him richly with the wisdomof the Holy Ones, with the spirit of his calling, with the power of his Priest-hood, and with the gift of discernment. Bless, according to their calling, hisassistants and all who are associatedwith him in the performance of theordinances, — baptisms, confirmations,washings, anointings, sealings, endow-ments, and ordinations which are per-formed herein, that all that is done may be holy and acceptable unto thee, thou God of our salvation. Bless the record-ers and copyists, that the records of the Temple may be kept perfect, and with-out omissions and errors, and that theymay also be accepted of thee. Bless, in their several positions, the engineers,watchmen, guards, and all others who have duties to perform in connection with the house, that they may perform them unto thee with an eye single to thy glory.Remember also in thy mercy all those who have labored in the erection of this house, or who have, in any way, by their means or influence aided in its comple-tion; may they in no wise lose theirreward.O thou God of our fathers Abraham,Isaac and Jacob, whose God thou de-lightest to be called, we thank thee withall the fervor of overflowing gratitudethat thou hast revealed the powers bywhich the hearts of the children are being turned to their fathers and the hearts of the fathers to the children, that the sons of men in all their genera-tions can be made partakers of the glories and joys of the kingdom of heaven. Confirm upon us the spirit of Elijah, we pray thee, that we may thus redeem our dead and also connect our-selves with our fathers who have passed behind the veil, and furthermore seal upour dead to come forth in the first resur-rection that we who dwell on the earth maybe bound to those who dwell in heaven. We thank thee for their sake who havefinished their work in mortality, as wellas for our own, that the prison doors havebeen opened, that deliverance has been proclaimed to the captive, and the bonds have been loosened from those who werebound. We praise thee that our fathers, from last to first, from now back to the beginning, can be united with us in indissoluble links, welded by the holy Priesthood, and that as one great familyunited in thee and cemented by thypower we shall together stand beforethee, and by the power of the atoning blood of thy Son be delivered from allevil, be saved and sanctified, exalted and glorified. Wilt thou also permit holy messengers to visit us within these sacred walls and make known unto uswith regard to the work we should per-form in behalf of our dead. And, as thou has inclined the hearts of manywho have not yet entered into covenantwith thee to search out their progenitorsand in so doing they have traced theancestry of many of thy Saints, we praythee, that thou wilt increase this desire in their bosoms, that they may in this way aid in the accomplishment of thy work. Bless them, we pray thee, in their labors, that they may not fall intoerrors in preparing their genealogies; and furthermore, we ask thee to open before them new avenues of information,and place in their hands the records ofthe past, that their work may not only be correct but complete also.O thou Great Father of the spirits ofall flesh, graciously bless and fullyqualify those upon whom thou hast placed a portion of thine authority andwho bear the responsibilities and powersof the Priesthood which is after the order of thy Son. Bless them all from first to last, from thy servant who repre-sents thee in all the world to the latestwho has been ordained to the Deacon'soffice. Upon each and all confer the spirit of their calling, with a compre-hension of its duties and a loving zeal to fulfill them. Endow them with faith, patience and understanding. May their lives be strong in virtue and adorned with humility; may their ministrationsbe effectual, their prayers be availingand their teachings the path of salvation.May they be united by the Spirit and power of God in all their labors, and inevery thought, word and act may they glorify thy name and vindicate the wis-dom that has made them kings andpriests unto thee.For thy servants of the First Presi-dency of the Church we first of all pray. Reveal in great clearness, thy mind andwill unto them in all things essential for the welfare of thy people; give them heavenly wisdom, abounding faith andthe power and gifts necessary to enablethem to preside acceptably unto thee over the officers and members of thyChurch. Remember in love thy servant whom thou hast called to be a Prophet,Seer and Revelator to all mankind, whosedays have been many upon the earth; yet lengthen out his span of mortal life,we pray thee, and grant unto him all thepowers and gifts, in their completeness, of the office thou hast conferred uponhim; and in like manner bless his asso-ciates in the Presidency of thy Church.Confer upon thy servants the TwelveApostles, a rich endowment of thy Spirit. Under their guidance may the Gospel of the kingdom go forth intoall the world, to be preached to allnations, kindreds, tongues, and people,that the honest in heart in every landmay hear the glad tidings of joy and salvation. Overrule, we pray thee, inthe midst of the governments of theearth, that the barriers that now standin the way of the spread of thy truths may be removed, and liberty of con-science be accorded to all peoples.Remember in loving kindness thyservants, the Patriarchs. May they be full of blessings for thy people Israel. May they bear with them the seeds of comfort and consolation, of encourage-ment and blessing. Fill them with the Holy Spirit of promise, and be gracious-ly pleased to fulfill their words of prophecy, that thy name may be extolled by the people of thy Church and their faith in thee and in the promises of thy ministering servants be increasingly strengthened.With thy servants of the Twelve, bless their associates the Seventies; may they be powerful in the preaching of thy word and in bearing it to the four quarters of the earth. May an ever-widening way be opened before themuntil they shall have raised the Gospel standard in every land and proclaimedits saving truths in every tongue, that all[t]he islands and the continents may re-joice in the testimony of the great work thou art in these latter days performingon the earth.Bless abundantly, O Lord, the High Priests in all the varied duties and posi-tions to which thou hast called them. As standing ministers of thy word in the multiplying Stakes of Zion, wilt thou endow them richly with the spirit of their exalted callings. As Presidents,Counselors, Bishops, members of High Councils, and in every other office which their Priesthood gives them the right to fill, may they be righteous ministers of thy holy law, loving fathersof the people, and as judges in the midstof the Saints may they deal out just andimpartial judgment tempered with mercyand love.So also, in their various callings, con-fer precious gifts of wisdom, faith andknowledge upon thy servants the Elders, 
 those of us who have the Spirit of Godknow that it is true.I feel to thank God for the progressof the work. The Elders of Israel areabroad among the nations carrying theGospel to the children of men, and the Lord is blessing them and opening the way before them. It is true, our doctrine is not popular. In fact, the Latter-day Saints as a body have been under a ban, in a great measure, from the or-ganization of the Church until of late. The doctrine of Jesus is an unpopular doctrine. But there is only one Gospel; never was but one Gospel ordained of God to man for the salvation of the human family. That Gospel was taught by the Savior and by His Apostles. It was taught Joseph Smith by Moroni, and the Priesthood was given unto him by John the Baptist, and Peter, James andJohn. [##Joseph Smith—History 1:59, 72##] The first principle of that Gos-pel is faith. Well, the people of the world may say, we all believe in Jesus Christ. Yes, but there is something to do besides believing in Christ. We must repent of our sins, be baptized for the remission of them, and receive the Holy Ghost. This is the doctrine taught by Christ and His Apostles. The same Gospel was taught to Adam and by him to his chil[d]ren. These doc-trines have been revealed to us by the administration of angels. The gifts the graces, and powers that belonged to that Gospel are with this people, and have been from the organization of the Church.My brethren and sisters, we must be faithful, because the responsibility is great and mighty that rests upon us as bearers of the Holy Priesthood. You will see many strange things take place in the earth. We are at the end, so to speak, of the six thousand years. We are bordering on the millennium, when the Son of Man shall come in the clouds of heaven. Therefore, we can-not lay down our Priesthood and the work which the God of heaven has put into our hands. The eyes of God and the heavenly host are upon us. The eyes of the Prophet Joseph and all those sanctified spirits who have laid down their lives for the work of God and testimony of Jesus are upon us Therefore, I feel this morning to bear my testimony to these things. The Lord has blessed me, so far as life is concerned, a long time. I have been connected with this Church while almost two or three quorums of Apostles have passed away. Let us lay these things to heart. Let us look at our position before the Lord. Let us be true and faithful in the work of the ministry andin doing the things God requires at our hands. God has blessed us. He has led us unto these mountains of Israel. The prophet of God was inspired to bring the people to this great American desert. There were no marks of the white man here, no marks of agricul-ture, and nothing to encourage any man to stop here; but President Brigham Young pitched his tent here, and laid the foundation of this city, withthese broad streets and sidewalks, in the midst of sand and sagebrush. The Lord's Spirit was with him, and he saw what was to do here. We are in the midst of the mountains of Israel, pro-phesied of as the gathering place of the people of God in the last days, wherethey might stand in holy places while the judgments of God worked in the earth. Let us try to do our duty, and labor for the Holy Spirit. The devil and the fallen spirits have labored from the creation of the world to thwart the purposes of God. He did it in the days of Christ. He tempted even Him forty days and forty nights. His Apos-tles did not escape, either. We shall not escape any more than they did The arch-enemy is laboring for the overthrow of this Church and kingdom. He knows something about it. There-fore, you and I ought to pursue a coursewherein we can be justified before the Lord. There are many events before us and at our door, and they follow each other in quick succession. No power on earth or under the earth can stay thefulfillment of these things. You can hardly see them with your eyes hear them with your ears, and feel them in your spirits. And when these strange things take place, no man should mar-vel and wonder at them, because they are in the great programme. They have been decreed by Almighty God, and these things are only the begi[n]ning of sorrows.I want to make a few remarks on another subject. Whenever the Lord has a people on the earth, no matter in what age of the world, they will dove-tail right square into any other dispen-sation. You may see that throughout the whole history of the world. When Christ was born and entered into the ministry, and when He chose His Apos-tles, they acknowledged every revelation that had ever been given from fa[t]her Adam down to their day. They had the same Gospel, the same gifts, the same fruits. Now, if these Latter day Saints are the saints of God, their works will be the same as were Christ's and the Apostles. I hold in my hand the Doctrine and Covenants, containingrevelations given through the Prophet Joseph Smith while he dwelt in the flesh. Read those revelations, and from beginning to end they unite with all dispensations God has had on the earth. And that is not all. When God has a people on the earth the fruits of the Gospel will be manifest. In my boyhood I went to Sabbath school, un-der old Dr. Porter. I read the New Testament; I read about the gifts and graces that Christ and His Apostles had; and I asked Dr. Porter why it was that they did not contend for this faith, and why they did not have these gifts and graces. "Oh," said he, "those things were given in the dark ages of the world, to convince the world that Jesus was the Christ. We live today in the glorious Gospel light of Christ, and we do not need them." Then, said I, for God's sake give me the dark ages of the world! That has been my spirit from that day to this. Here are thousands of men and women in this house, if they had the opportunity, could rise up and bear testimony that the fruits of the Gospel which the Apostles enjoyed are with these peo-ple. These Elders who have traveled thousands of miles can bear testimony that wherever this Gospel has been preached and wherever the Elders of Israel have administered, the gifts and graces have followed them. I bear tes-timony to this. My brethren can bear testimony to it. The sick have been healed, devils have been cast out, the lame have leaped, the deaf have heard, and all the gifts and graces that ever were manifest have been enjoyed among these Elders of Israel.  Several years ago I met a man and woman here in the street. The woman said, "Do you know me?" I said I do not. "Do you know this man that is with me?" "No, I do not." "Why," said she, "you laid hands on this boy in Herefordshire fifty years ago. He was dumb—never spoke a word till you laid hands upon him and blessed him; and he has spoken ever since." We have no business to claim to be Saints of the living God without we have the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and if we have that, these gifts will be with us. You know this as well as I do. Joseph Smith had the whole spirit and power of this rest-ing upon him while he lived. He taught these principles to us, and they have been realized, and will be until this scene is wound up. This work shows for itself. That Gospel was taught Joseph Smith by an angel, as John the Revelator says:And I saw another angel fly in the midst ofheaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preachunto them that dwell on the earth, and to everynation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.Saying with a loud voice, fear God, and giveglory to Him; for the hour of His judgment iscome. [##Revelation 14:6-7##]Yes, the hour of God's judgment is come, and we should be prepared. Who besides the Latter day Saints, since the days of Christ and His Apostles, have ever taught the principle of the redemption of the dead? Here we have four temples reared in this State by the Latter-day Saints, and tens of thousands of the dead have been re-deemed by the administration of the Gospel of Christ to their posterity or friends. This is one of the evidences of the fulfillment of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The prophet says, "Saviors shall come up on mount Zion * *  and the kingdom shall be the Lord's." [##Obadiah 1:21##] If we were not the saints of God, we could not do this. Whatever other dispensations may have done in this direction, we have no record of it. Jesus himself preached this doctrine. While his body lay in the tomb he went and preached to those who were in the spirit world, that they might be judgedaccording to men in the flesh. This work is with the Latter-day Saints, and will remain with us.We lost one of our Apostles a short time since. He was about the youngest man in the quorum of the Apostles. He was called suddenly away from us. There is a meaning to this. Many times things take place with us that we do notcomprehend, unless it is given to us byrevelation. But there is a meaning in the loss of that young Apostle. I had amanifestation of that while in San Fran-cisco recently. One evening, as I fell asleep, I was very much troubled with evil spirits, that tried to afflict me; and while laboring to throw off these spirits and their influence, there was another spirit visited me that seemed to have power over the evil spirits, and they de-parted from me. Before he left me he told me not to grieve because of the de-parture of Abraham Hoagland Cannon; for the Lord had called him to fill another important mission in the spirit world, as a pure and holy Apostle from Zion in the Rocky Mountains—a labor which would not only prove a great benefit to his father's household, but to the Church and kingdom of God upon the earth. I feel to name this, because it is true. I have become acquainted with many things in our history that I have marveled at. While in the St.

 THE DESERET NEWS. 91in the grave or leaning on their staff for veryage.There is Parley Pratt, jun., who has just spoken.I remember the day of his birth very well, forhis mother died the day he was born and I atten-ded her funeral.Now he has grown to be a man, and I rejoiceto hear him bear testimony of the work of Godin connection with the other young brethren: itdoes my soul good to see them coming on to the stage of action. I realize that the kingdom of ourGod, of which we are members is only in its in-fancy, although we look upon it as being greatcompared with what it has been.It commenced like a small mustard seed, butit has gradually increased until the birds begin tolodge in its branches, and yet it is but small com-pared with what it is to be. We have had manysymbols and figures presented to our minds to il-lustrate the growth and increase of the kingdomof God, and I will here say in respect to its beinglike the comparison made by Daniel it answersthe figure very well, only instead of it rolling down hill it has come up hill into the tops of themount[a]ins, and I do hope and pray that it maycontinue to grow and increase in strength and in power, that when it rolls down hill it may gowith mighty power and accelerated speed, that itmay not require so much toil, labor and fatigueto carry the kingdom from the mountains as itdid to bring it up. [##Daniel 2:35##]I have no fears in regard to the increase ofthis kingdom, and I may also add that I neverhad any, only so far as concerned the weaknessesand frailties of mortality. I hope we may allpursue the course laid down for us by the ser-vants of the Lord, for if we do this I know thatwe shall be safe in this world, and secure happi-ness and exaltation in the word to come.There are a few thoughts that I wish to presentto the congregation touching one principle thathas been alluded to by the brethren, namely in regard to following the instructions and counselsof those who lead us. I have reflected muchupon this subject and I contend that there is oneprinciple by which the Lord leads his servants,and if we are faithful they will lead us in the wayof life, and in as much as we have faith to be-lieve in their instructions, in the teachings of theHoly Spirit through them we are always in thesafe path, and shall be sure of our reward.You take a shepherd for instance, and according to the ancient practice we learn that they alwayswent forward and prepared the way, so that there could be no danger in advance but what the shep-herd would learn of in time to save the sheep. Ifthey are allowed to run by the shepherd, thewolves are apt to catch them and destroy them,and the very moment that men in this kingdomattempt to run ahead or cross the path of theirleaders, no matter in what respect, the momentthey do this they are in danger of being injuredby the wolves.This is a subject upon which I have thoughta great deal, and I have gained a little useful know-ledge during my experience by watching the con-duct of men, and I have never in my life knownit to fail, that when men went contrary to thecounsel of their leaders, neither in the days ofJoseph nor of br. Brigham but they always be-came entangled and suffered a loss by so doing.Now whatever I might have obtained in theshape of learning, by searching and study re-specting the arts and sciences of men, whateverprinciples I may have inbibed during my scienti-fic researches, yet if the prophet of God shouldtell me that a certain principle, or theory whichI might have learned was not true, I do not carewhat my ideas might have been I should considerit my duty, at the suggestion of my file leader toabandon that principle or theory. Supposing hewere to say the principles by which you aregoverned are not right, that they were incorrectwhat would be my duty? I answer that it wouldbe my duty to lay those principles aside, and totake up those that might be laid down by the servants of God.I have seen men in the days of Joseph bring upprinciples, and read and teach, and advocate theo-ries when the prophet would say "it is not rightto do so, they are not true." Those men wouldstill argue, maintain their position, and they would write in defence of their theories when the pro-phet condemned them, and they would say wehave not faith in your theory, nor in the systemyou present.The very moment a man does that he crossesthe path of the servant of God who is set to leadthe way to life and salvation. This is one thingthat the Elders should carefully avoid. The factis there are great many things taught in thebuilding up of this kingdom which seems strangeto us being contrary to our traditions and are cal-culated to try men. Br. Joseph used a great manymethods of testing the integrity of m[e]n, and hetaught a great many things which in consequenceof tradition required prayer, faith and a testimonyfrom the Lord before they could be believed bymany of the Saints, his mind was opened by thevisions of the Almighty, and the Lord taught himmany things by vision and revelation that werenever taught publicly in his day, for the peoplecould not bear the flood of intelligence which Godpoured into his mind.How was it in that day in reference to manythings that were taught and practised? All wasnot revealed at once but the Lord showed theprophet a principle and the people acted upon itaccor[d]ing to the light which they had, all theperfections and glory of it was not revealed atfirst but as fast as it was revealed the people en-deavored to obey.I will bring up one thing which will show thatthe position I take is correct, viz:—baptism forthe dead; when that was first revealed we rejoic-ed in it and as soon as we had an opportunity webegan to be baptised for our dead; a man wouldbe baptised for both male and female.The moment I heard of it my soul leapedwith joy, for it was a subject in which I felt deep-ly interested, I went forward and was baptisedfor all my dead relatives I could think of bothmale and female as did others, but afterward weob[t]ained more light upon the subject and Presi-dent Young taught the people that men shouldattend to those ordinances for the male portionof their dead friends and females for females;this showed the order in which those ordinances should be administered, which ordinances hadbefore been revealed, and shows us that we are ina school where we shall be constantly learning.This revelation in connection with the revela-tion and vision concerning the three glories gaveme more joy and consolation than any revelationI ever read and I had a great desire to obey it.I was taught from my childhood that there was one Heaven and one Hell and was told thatthe wicked all had one punishment and therighteous one glory, that the grey headed sinnerwho had spent his days in wickedness, debauch-ery and murder would go to hell to suffer ever-lasting torments, and that the youth but sixteen years of age, who had not been religious, wouldgo to the same hell, suffer the same kind of tor-ment and for the same length of time, and thatJesus and the apostles and all men who had suf-fered death for the testimony which they borefor the kingdom of God and the works of right-eousness would have the same glory and no morethan the Presbyterian deacon in Kentucky with his hundred negroes who had never made a sacri-fice in his life, but had been full of this world'sgoods, but he was a professor of religion.I never did believe a word of this doctrine aday since I was born and I am sure that I neverdid before, and when I read the vision and wastaught the principle of the baptism for the dead, it enlightened my mind and gave me great joy,it appeared to me that the God who revealed thatprinciple unto man was wise, just and true, pos-sessed both the best of attributes and good senseand knowledge, I felt he was consistent with bothlove, mercy, justice and judgment, and I felt tolove the Lord more than ever before in my life.I never was satisfied with the doctrine taughtby the sectarian world upon this subject in mylife, and hence I felt to say hallelujah when therevelation came forth revealing to us baptism forthe dead. I felt that we had a right to rejoice inthe blessings of Heaven. I felt when I firstlearned of the justice of God in relation to hi[s]rewarding all men according to their deeds, thatsuch a God was reasonable, and I felt I couldworship such a God, and I was just so when Iheard of baptism for the dead.There are thousands and millions who neverhad the privilege of being baptised for themselvesand hence never ought to be punished for notobeying a law which they never heard. Howdid we feel when we first heard the living couldbe baptised for the dead? We all went to workas it as fast as we had an opportunity, and werebaptised for every body we could think of with-out respect to sex.I went and was baptised for all my friends,grandmothers, and aunts as well as those of themale sex, but how was it? Why by and bye itwas revealed through the servants of the Lord that females should be baptised for females, and males for males, but the full particulars of this order was not revealed till after the days of Joseph, therefore this shows an advance in thebuilding up of the kingdom, the gathering ofIsrael and the warning of the nations of theearth.You will see an advance in a great manythings, for the Lord will open the mind of br.Brigham and lead him into many principles thatpertain to the salvation of this people, and wecannot close up our minds and say that we willgo so far and no further; this we cannot do with-out jeopardising our standing before God.With regard to crossing the path of any manwho may be appointed to lead us, I will say wenever should do it, and I do not care what ourfeelings and views may be upon the subject asfar as our traditions and education is concerned.If God has anything to reveal, he will reveal itto that man who stands at the head. Now hereis the quorum of the Twelve Apostles; we cannotbring forth a new revelation for the guidance ofthis people while the Frst Presidency are here,for there is no other plan, no other system bywhich to guide and govern men in this kingdom,only that which has been established by therevelations of God in the order of His churchand kingdom, and that is for the head to lead,counsel and govern in all dispensations in whichthe will of God is revealed to man.I wish to say a few words to the missionaries,to those who are going abroad to preach the gos-pel of Christ. I want to give you a word of ex-hortation and counsel, brethren, that is wheneveryour are in doubt about any duty or work which you have to perform never proceed to do anything until you go and labor in prayer and get theHoly Spirit, wherever the Sprit dictates you togo or to do, that will be right, and by followingits dictates you will come out right.We shall be brought to many places duringour career in the ministry among the nations ofthe earth, where we may consider a certaincourse or procedure to be right, but if we do notknow it will be better for us to go before the Lord,and ask in faith that we may be instructed in theway of life.I will take the liberty of saying that it is yourprivilege brethren to get the mind and will of theLord in relation to your duties while abroadamong the people, and it is also the privilege ofthe whole people who are called Israel to obtainthe revelations of the Holy Spirit to guide themin every duty in life, whatever position a manmay stand in it is his privilege as a Saint of Godto enjoy this blessing, and a man who understandshimself will not move without the operations ofthat Spirit to lead him.Brethren, as the order of the day is short ser-mons, I will not detain you longer, but I will say that I am happy to be with you, and my soul doesrejoice in the things of God, for I feel that I havebeen fed in my mind not only to-day but yester-day and all through the conference, and I do feelthat we of all men have the greatest reason torejoice. For the Lord has committed unto ourHands the gospel of Jesus Christ, the way of lifeand salvation, we can walk into this Tabernacleand our places of worship and sing and pray andpreach and praise the Lord with none to molestus.We can plant and build and eat and inheritthose things which God has given us in peaceand quietness, for these things we should feelthankful and feel in our hearts to acknowledgethe hand of God therein.The truths and revelations which have beenmade known unto this people, for their salvationand exaltation and glory and for the salvation ofall men both the living and the dead are of greatvalue and worth unto us and unto all men if theywouldreceive them; we are the only people to whomthis holy gospel, priesthood and covenants havebeen committed in our day, and we shall be heldresponsible for the use we made of it.Then we should be diligent and faithful inoffering this great salvation unto the children ofmen, and in building up Zion, and the kingdomof our God, we should also be careful to strictlyobey the voice of our Heavenly Father and thevoice and counsel of his servants who are setto lead us; which may the Lord enable us to do,which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 Priests, Teachers, and Deacons, that allmay diligently perform their part in theglorious labors thou hast called thyPriesthood to bear.Forget not, we beseech thee, thy ser-vants the missionaries, who are pro-claiming the saving truths that thou hast revealed for man's redemption to themillions who are now overshadowed bydeep spiritual darkness. Preserve them from all evil, deliver them from mob violence, may they want no good thing,but be greatly blessed with the gifts and powers of their ministry. Remember also their families that they may be sustained and comforted by thee and becherished and cared for by thy Saints.We pray thee for the members of thy holy Church throughout all the world,that thy people may be so guided and governed of thee, that all who profess to be and call themselves Saints may be preserved in the unity of the faith, in the way of truth, in the bonds of peaceand in holiness of life. Strengthen theweak, we pray thee, and impart thySpirit unto all.Our Father, may peace abide in allthe homes of thy Saints; may holy angels guard them; may they be encom-passed by thine arms of love; mayprosperity shine upon them, and maythe tempter and the destroyer be re-moved far from them. May the days of thy covenant people be lengthened outin righteousness, and sickness and dis-ease be rebuked from their midst. Maythe land they inhabit be made fruitful bythy grace; may its waters be increasedand the climate be tempered to the com-fort and need of thy people; may drought, devastating storms, cyclones,and hurricanes be kept afar off, and earthquakes never disturb the land which thou hast given us. May locusts,caterpillars and other insects not de-stroy our gardens and desolate our fields; but may we be a people blessed of thee in our bodies and spirits, in our homes and habitations, in our flocks and herds, in ourselves and our posterity,and in all that thou hast made us stew-ards over.Now pray we for the youth of Zion—the children of thy people; endow themrichly with the spirit of faith and righteousness and with increasing lovefor thee and for thy law. Prosper all the institutions that thou hast established in our midst for their well-being. Give to our Church schools an ever-increasing power for good. May thy Holy Spiritdominate the teachings given therein and also control the hearts and illuminethe minds of the students. Bless mar-velously thy servants, the General Superintendent, and all the principals, teachers and other officers, and also thosewho form the General Board of Educationof thy Church. Remember likewise in thy loving kindness the Sunday schools,with all who, either as teachers or schol-ars, belong thereto; may the influence of the instruction given therein broadenand deepen, to thy glory and the salva-tion of thy children, until the perfect day. Bless the members of the General Board of the Deseret Sunday School Union with the wisdom necessary for the proper fulfillment of their duties and for the accomplishment of the purposes for which this board was created.We also uphold before thee the YoungMen's and Young Ladies' Mutual Im-provement associations, with all theirofficers, general and local, and themembers. May they be prospered ofthee, their membership be enlarged and the good that they accomplish increasewith every succeeding year. For thePrimaries and Religion classes we alsoseek thy constant blessing and guidingcare; may the spirit of instruction bepoured out upon the presidents andassociate officers and  teachers. Maythey keep pace with the rest of the edu-cational establishments in thy Church,so that from their earliest years ourchildren may be diligently brought up inthe ways of the Lord, and thy name bemagnified in their growth in virtue andintelligence.Nor would we forget, O Lord, the normal training classes among the peo-ple, whether these classes be connectedwith the Church schools, the Improve-ment associations, or the Sunday schools. Grant that these classes may be the means of spreading true educa-tion throughout all the borders of the Saints by the creation of a body of teachers who will not only be possessed of rare intelligence but be filled also with the spirit of the Gospel, and bepowerful in the testimony of thy truthand in implanting a love for thee and for thy works in the hearts of all whom they instruct.We would hold up before thee, OLord, the Relief Societies with all theirmembers; and all those who preside intheir midst according to their callingsand appointments, general or local.Bless the teachers in their labors of mercy and charity, who, as ministeringangels, visit the homes of the sick and the needy, bearing succor, consolation and comfort to the unfortunate and sor-rowful. And bless, we beseech thee,most merciful Father, the poor of thypeople, that the cry of want and suffer-ing may not ascend unto thee from themidst of thy Saints whom thou hastblessed so abundantly with the comfortsof this world. Open up new avenuesby which the needy can obtain a liveli-hood by honest industry, and also in-cline the hearts of those blessed moreabundantly, to give generously of theirsubstance to their, in this respect, lessfavored brethren and sisters, that thoumayest not have reason to chide usfor the neglect of even the least amongthy covenant children.O God of Israel, turn thy face, wepray thee, in loving kindness towardthy stricken people of the House of Judah. Oh, deliver them from those that oppress them. Heal up theirwounds, comfort their hearts, strengthentheir feet, and give them ministers afterthine own heart who shall lead them asof old, in thy way. May the days of their tribulation soon cease, and they beplanted by thee in the valleys and plains of their ancient home; and may Jerusa-lem rejoice and Judea be glad for themultitude of her sons and daughters, for the sweet voices of children in her streets, and the rich outpouring of thysaving mercies upon them. May Israelno more bow the head, or bend the neckto the oppressor, but may his feet be made strong on the everlasting hills, never more, by violence, to be banished therefrom, and the praise and the glory shall be thine.Remember in like pity the dwindlingremnants of the House of Israel, de-scendants of thy servant Lehi. Restorethem, we pray thee, to thine ancientfavor, fulfill in their completeness thepromises given to their fathers, andmake of them a white and delightsomerace, a loved and holy people as informer days. May the time also be nighat hand when thou wilt gather the dis-persed of Israel from the islands of the sea and from every land in which thou hast scattered them, and the ten tribesof Jacob from their hiding place in thenorth, and restore them to communion and fellowship with their kinsmen ofthe seed of Abraham.We thank thee, O God of Israel, that thou didst raise up patriotic men to lay the foundation of this great American government. Thou didst inspire them to frame a good Constitution and laws which guarantee to all of the inhabitantsof the land equal rights and privileges toworship thee according to the dictates of their own consciences. Bless the offi-cers, both judicial and executive. Con-fer abundant favors upon the President,his Cabinet, and Congress. Enlightened and guided by thy Spirit, may they main-tain and uphold the glorious principlesof human liberty. Our hearts are filledwith gratitude to thee, our Father inheaven, for thy kindness unto us in softening the hearts of our fellow citi-zens, the people of this nation, towardsus. That which thou hast done hasbeen marvelous in our eyes. We thankthee that thou didst move upon the heart of our President to issue a generalamnesty; that thou hast removedprejudice and misunderstanding fromthe minds of many of the people con-cerning us and our purposes, and theyare disposed to treat us as fellowcitizens, and not as enemies. In thisholy house we feel to give thee glorytherefor, and we humbly ask thee toincrease this feeling in their hearts. Enable them to see us in our true light. Show unto them that we are their friends,that we love liberty, that we will joinwith them in upholding the rights of thepeople, the Constitution and laws of ourcountry; and give unto us and our children an increased disposition to al-ways be loyal, and to do everything in our power to maintain constitutionalrights and the freedom of all within theconfines of this great Republic.Remember in mercy, O Lord, thekings, the princes, the nobles, the rulersand governors, and the great ones of theearth, and likewise all the poor, theafflicted and the oppressed, and indeed,all people, that their hearts may besoftened when thy servants go forth tobear testimony of thy name, that theirprejudices may give way before thetruth, and thy people find favor in their eyes. So control the affairs of the na-tions of the earth, that the way may be prepared for the ushering in of a reignof righteousness and truth. We desireto see liberty spread throughout the earth, to see oppression cease, the yokeof the tyrant broken, and every des-potic form of government overthrownby which thy children are degraded and crushed, and prevented from enjoyingtheir share of the blessings of the earth,which thou hast created for their habi-tation.O God, the Eternal Father, thouknowest all things. Thou seest thecourse thy people have been led to takein political matters. They have, in manyinstances, joined the two great national parties. Campaigns have been entered upon, elections have been held, and much party feeling has been engendered.Many things have been said and done which have wounded the feelings of thehumble and the meek, and which havebeen a cause of offense. We beseechthee, in thine infinite mercy and good-ness, to forgive thy people wherein they, 
 George Temple I had a son, who was in the north country, drowned. He was 21 years of age, and was a faith-ful young man. He had a warning of this. In a dream he was notified how he would die. We had testimony of that after his death. I asked the Lord why he was taken from me. The answer to me was, "You are doing a great deal for the redemption of your dead; but the law of redemption requires some of your own seed in the spirit world to attend to work connected with this." That was a new principle to me; but it satisfied me why he was taken away. I name this, because there are a great many instances like it among the Latterday Saints. This was the case with Brother Abraham Cannon. He was taken away to fulfill that mission. And where we have anything of this kind, we should leave it in the hands of God to reconcile.Let us try as Latter-day Saints to qualify ourselves to do the will of God and bear off His kingdom, and be true and faithful to the end, which may God grant, for Christ's sake. Amen.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.Truth and Liberty.No. 19. SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, OCTOBER 24, 1896. VOL. LIII.REMARKS Made at the General Conference on theafternoon of Monday, October 5,1896, in the Tabernacle, Salt LakeCity-[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.Wilford Woodruff, October 5, 1896MOSES THATCHERDISCOURSEDelivered by President Wilford Woodruff,at the General Conference of the Church,held in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,Monday Afternoon, October 5, 1896.I did not intend to occupy any more time in this conference, but there is a subject or two that I feel in duty bound to talk upon, and I hope the Saints will give me their prayers and faith, that Imay be enab'ed to do my duty. In order to arrive at the principles and subject I wish to speak of, I feel dis-posed to deviate from my general course of testimony in some respec[t]s.There are two powers on the earth and in the midst of the inhabitants of the earth—the power of God and the power of the devil. In our history we have had some very peculiar experiences. When God has had a people on the earth, it matters not in what age, Lucifer, the son of the morning, and the millions of fallen spirits that were cast out of heaven, have warred against God, against Christ, against the work of God, and against the people of God. And they are not backward in doing it in our day and generation. Whenever the Lord set His hand to perform any work, those powers labored to over-throw it. I have a little experience in this direction that I want to refer to. Many of you probably have read the history of the first proclamation of the Gospel in England, under the presidencyof Heber C Kimball, in 1837. Just previous to that I crossed Lake Ontario with a man by the name of Russell, from Canada into the United States. That man walked the steamer almost day and night, moaning and groaning. Whatwas the matter? He had a class of spirits that stayed with him night and day, distressing him. What he had done that they had power over him I do not know. When a man does his duty and keeps the commandments of God, those spirits have no power over him, although he may be distressed in a measure from their operation. This man went to England, and those spirits went with him. He was with the Apostles there, and while they were holding a conference there he was so troubled with those spirits that Brother Heber C Kimball and Orson Hyde and the brethren who were there laid hands upon him and cast those evil spirits out of him. When they left him they seized upon Brother Hyde, and he fell to the floor as though he had been knockedon the head with a club. Brother Kim-ball and the brethren immediately laid hands upon him, and the evil spirits left -------------------------him. They then fell upon Brother Kim-ball and tried to overcome him. But the vision of his mind was open and he saw them in the room. They gnashed their teeth at him; but did they over-come him? Brother Kimball held the Apostleship and he stood at the head of that Mission, and God gave him pow-er over those spirits, and they were rebuked and left him. This was the be-ginning of their labors there. In 1840, when the Apostles were sent to England, we had a similar experience. The history of my travels in Herefordshire, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire is published and known to the Church. After laboring there some eight months,Brothers Heber C. Kimball and Ge[o]rge A. Smith invited me to go to London You all know what kind of men Broth-ers Kimball and Smith were. They had power and brought a great many into the Church. We three went into the City of London to undertake to open doors in that great city. The first man who opened his doors to receive us was a man by the name of Morgan. The very day we entered that house it was filled with evil spirits, who sought to destroy us. We felt their power day after day. They did not particularly in-jure us at that time, but we knew they were with us. The incident that I am going to refer to now occurred after Brother Kimball had returned toManchester. Brother George A Smith and myself were left there. We sat up one night till about 11 o'clock, talking about the Gospel of Christ, and then went to bed. The room in which we slept was small; there was about three and a half feet between our cots. Those spirits were gathered together in that room and sought to destroy us. They fell upon us with the determina-tion to take our lives. The distress, the suffering and the horror that rested upon me I never experienced before nor since. While in this condition a spirit said to me, "Pray to the Lord." Well, a man in that kind of warfare, when he is choking almost to death, is in a peculiar position to pray. Nevertheless I went to praying with all the power I had. I knew we would die unless God opened some door for our deliverance, because we were being choked to death, and I prayed the Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ, to preserve our lives. While I was praying, the door opened and three messengers entered, and the room was filled with light equal to the blazing light of the sun at mid-day. Those messengers were all dressed in the robes of immortal beings. Who they were I know not. They laid hands upon me and my companion, and re-buked those evil powers, and we weresaved. From that hour to this day, not only our lives were saved, but those powers were rebuked by the angels of God so that no Elder since has been tormented with them in London.I name this because there is a prin-ciple in it. From the day that the Pro-phet Joseph Smith was called upon by the angel of God and the plates of the Book of Mormon given into his hands,these evil spirits labored for his death, and finally his blood was shed by the power of the devil. You know about that. It is before the heavens and the earth, and has got to be settled for. Those spirits are wherever the Saints of God are, and they will follow this up until He who holds the keys of deathand hell binds that old serpent, sets a seal upon him, and shuts him up for athousand years. These evil spirits are all around us. They follow every Elder of Israel at home and abroad. They tempt me; they tempt you, and will aslong as we dwell in the flesh and theyhave their agency and power. Why? Because they know the Priesthood is here; they know the power of God is here; they know the authority is here to seal blessings upon the heads of thechildren of men, and to preach the Gospel to the nations of the earth, that they may be prepared for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Knowing this, if they can get any power over you andme they will exercise it.There has been some talk here about myself, and my counselors, and the Twelve Apostles, and the position we hold as leaders of the people. I have been in the Apostleship for fifty sevenyears. I have been through all the apostasies in this Church, if I may be allowed to use that expression, from the day of the organization of the Twelve Apostles. On one occasion two Apos-tles came to me while I was in Kirtland, and told me that Joseph Smith was a fallen prophet, and that they wanted to put another man in his place—Oliver Cowdery. They wanted to know what I would do about it. Said I, "Every man that lifts his hand against the Pro-phet of God will go to hell, unless he repents of his sins." Well, about half of them did repent; the others did not,and they lost their crown and glory, and other men have taken their places.My brethren and sisters, there is some-thing pressing upon my mind that I want to say. We have arrived at a point here with regard to circumstances that it is my duty to take up as the President of the Church. The First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles were never more united as a body than they are today. Our spirits are united. We believe to-gether, we work together, we pray to-gether; and we believe in each other, be-cause we are all trying to do the will of God. This is the case with all of us, with one exception. That exception is 
 have sinned in this direction. Show them, O Father, their faults and their errors, that they may see the same in thelight of thy Holy Spirit, and repenttruly and sincerely, and cultivate thatspirit of affection and love which thouart desirous that all the children of men should entertain one for another, and which thy Saints, above all others,should cherish. Enable thy peoplehereafter to avoid bitterness and strife,and to refrain from words and acts inpolitical discussions that shall createfeeling and grieve thy Holy Spirit.Heavenly Father, when thy peopleshall not have the opportunity of enter-ing this holy house to offer their suppli-cations unto thee, and they are op-pressed and in trouble, surrounded bydifficulties or assailed by temptation,and shall turn their faces towards thisthy holy house and ask thee for deliver-ance, for help, for thy power to be ex-tended in their behalf, we beseech theeto look down from thy holy habitationin mercy and tender compassion uponthem, and listen to their cries. Orwhen the children of thy people, in years to come, shall be separated, through any cause, from this place, andtheir hearts shall turn in remembrance of thy promises to this holy Temple, and they shall cry unto thee from the depths of their affliction and sorrow to extend relief and deliverance to them,we humbly entreat thee to turn thine earin mercy to them; hearken to their cries,and grant unto them the blessings forwhich they ask.Almighty Father, increase within us the powers of that faith delivered to and possessed by thy Saints. Strengthenus by the memories of the glorious de-liverances of the past, by the remem-brance of the sacred covenants that thouhast made with us, so that, when evil overshadows us, when trouble encom-passes us, when we pass through thevalley of humiliation, we may not falter,may not doubt, but in the strength ofthy holy name may accomplish all thy righteous purposes with regard to us,fi[l]l the measure of our creation, and triumph gloriously, by thy grace, overevery besetting sin, be redeemed fromevery evil, and be numbered in thekingdom of heaven amongst those whoshall dwell in thy presence forever.And now, our Father, we bless thee,we praise thee, we glorify thee, we worship thee, day by day we magnifythee, and give thee thanks for thy greatgoodness towards us thy children, and we pray thee, in the name of thy SonJesus Christ, our Savior, to hear theseour humble petitions, and answer usfrom heaven, thy holy dwelling place, where thou sittest enthroned in glory,might, majesty, and dominion, and with an infinitude of power which we, thymortal creatures, cannot imagine, much less comprehend. Amen and Amen.After the prayer the whole assem-b[l]a[g]e joined in the holy "Hosanna shout," as follows:"Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, to God and the Lamb. Amen, Amen,Amen." This sacred exercise was accompanied by simultaneous wavingof handkerchiefs by all the people as-sembled.The Hosanna anthem, (composedfor the dedication by Evan Stephens)was sung by the choir, and, followingdirectly after it, the assemblage joinedin singing "The Spirit of God like a Fire is Burning."PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNONAddressed the congregation. His re-marks were in harmony with the greatoccasion. They were not only instructive, but of such a character as toafford comfort and consolation to theSaints, pointing their minds to abrighter day in the future than theyhad ever yet beheld.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFspoke words of comfort for the peopleof Zion, and uttered a prophecy con-cerning the future of the people ofGod. 
 Prayer By W. Woodruff who also addressed the congregationthe following are some of the remarks He made. I am alwaysinterested in meeting with the saints esspecialy with so many of the Seventies & Elders as are here to day.  There never was a school in any age of the world that presents as much of interest to the reflecting mind as the one presenting itself to us in this age not ownly the affairs of the church but the History of the changes & Revelotion of all Nations on Earth. the Time has come when the Earth

 is to be redeemed from the power & dominion of the Devil& the heavens with all the prophets that have ever lived are includedin the great work. The Elders who are before me to day have this great battle to fight & the victor to win I never saw a time in any age of my life when I have had moredesire to live than at the present time I want to see the work progress the kingdom rise that it may become esstablisedin all the Earth & the effects that will follow. yes  the Elders should improve their time in treasuring up knowlyge & counsel for you will want it when you go the Nations of the Earth dont spend your time in playing cards dice chess or in any such foolish way but improve the time to the best advantage & seek to conquer yourselves & preside over yourselves & bring all your passions in subject to the law of Christ as our president has taught us One item which I count of importance I wish to speak off.I wish to exhort the 70th & Elders to keep a Journal & History of their lives for the record & history of this church & kingdom will be wanted in a future day their has been no dispensation on Earth the procedings of which will be more interesting then the one in which we live. Should we ever have the privilege in our resurrectedbodies of visiting other planits & the inhabitants of the same we should want to learn the history of that people If they had kept no records of their lives & the dealings of God with them so we could not get their History we should feel much disap-pointed so would they should they visit us, it is true that Joseph Smith kept a History of his own life & thosethings in some measure connected with him. He is nowdead but his life & Testimony is now being published to the world in dseparate peaces in our publications. Also president Young has scribes who are recording his daily acts & life which is right & good, but does that record the life History & the dealings of God with the many thousands of the Apostles & Elders who are or will be in all the world among evry Nation under Heaven No verrily No, then all ye Elders of Israel write your History & the dealings ofGod with you in all the world for your own benefit& that of your posterity, for the benefit of the House of Israel, for the benefit of Jew & Gentile for the benefit of futur generations, & in fine for the benefit of these celestial beings from others planets who may see fit to visit us either in time or Eternity & wish to visit our libraries & peruse the History of the inhabitants of theEarth esspecially the Saints in the last dispensation & fulness of times then write & do not neglect it; many other remarks were made by the speaker which are not recorded Here 
 Brother Moses Thatcher. A great manypeople marvel and wonder why some-thing is not done with him. Some have said we were afraid of Moses Thatcher. I am not afraid of Moses Thatcher, nor of any other man who breathes thebreath of life, when it comes to a matter of duty. But I am afraid to disobey God, or to not perform my duty in any position that I am called to in the Church. There has been a great deal said with regard to Brother Moses Thatcher, and many have wondered why something was not done about him. Well, I will say that this is a matter that belongs to the Twelve Apostles. He is a member of that quorum, and of course it is their duty to take hold of that work and at-tend to it until it is settled. But I have felt, as the President of the Church, it is my duty to not let this conference pass without saying something upon this sub-ject. Brother Moses Thatcher has been a very sick man. Preparations have been made by the Twelve Apostles to settle this difficulty with him in council; but he has been in the condition I speak of. What is the difficulty with BrotherThatcher? The difficulty is, he has not been with his quorum in spirit for years. He has not been united with them hardly, I may say, since the death of President Taylor. It is not his declining to sign this declaration of principle that was brought up at the last conference by the leaders of Israel. This is a matter of comparatively small consequence. I say here—and I say the truth—Brother Thatcher has not been in fellowship with us for a series of years. He has not met with his quorum. He has spent days and days in this city, when he was perfectly able to go about and do busi-ness, and has not met with them—neither at their sacrament meetings nor other meetings. Now, this cannot re-main in this way. As I have said, these evil spirits affect men. There is a spirit affecting him, and not a good spirit either. With regard to his standing with his quorum, he should have met with them and talked these things over; but he has not done it. He has met with them comparatively few times since President Taylor's death.Brethren and sisters, these are truths. The Apostles know that he has neglect-ed to meet with them at times when he could and should have done so. He has been at difference with them in manythings that have transpired. He has been by himself in his labor, and for himself, and not for the Church. Now, I want to say that neither Moses Thatcher nor any other man on the face of theearth can stand in the way of this Church. We have had almost whole quorums of Apostles that have been in the road, and they have had to be moved out of it, because the kingdom of God cannot stop for anybody—for Wilford Woodruff, for Moses Thatcher, or for anybody else.Unless we work with the Saints of God, with the Priesthood of God and with the organization of His Church, we cannot have any power or influence. I make this testimony because it is my duty. I have thought a great deal of Moses Thatcher. I had a good deal to do with his coming into the quorum of the Apostles. I had a great respect for his family. I have for any man that will bear his testimony to the Gospel and kingdom of God. But he has stopped that. He has taken a different course with regard to this, and he occupies that position today. I name this because he is not in a condition to be tried. The Lord's kingdom is going to roll on. If I took a stand against my counselors and against the Twelve Apostles, and we were not united together, I could not go with them. But the Lord is with us, and with His people. Whatever is re-quired at our hands we want to perform it. I hope that the little time we spend here in the flesh, before we go into the valley of the shadow of death, we will pursue a course wherein we will be satisfied when we come to meet the Lord, and Joseph Smith, and the patri-archs and prophets. We will meet these people in the morning of the first resur-rection. Many of them have got their resurrected bodies, and those who have not will have their bodies raised from the grave in an immortal condition. Who can sacrifice eternal life, and a part in the first resurrection, to stand with their wives and children in celestial glory, for the honor of this life or to gratify ambition? I cannot afford to do it, neither can you. We will hail Brother Moses Thatcher with every sentiment  of our hearts when he will meet with us, unite with us, repent of his wrong-doings, and help carry on the work of God as he should do. Without this, he cannot go with us.God bless you. I bear testimony to the heavens and the earth that this is the church and kingdom of God. We have got to live our religion and to be united in order to bear off the kingdomand receive those blessings that lie on the other side of the veil for us. I pray that His blessing and spirit may rest, not only on the First Presidency and Apos-tles and the whole Priesthood and the Saints, but upon Moses Thatcher, that his eyes may be opened to see, his earsto hear, and his heart to comprehend his position and duty before God and man. 
 DISCOURSEBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVERED IN THENew Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,Sunday Afternoon, Septem-ber 12th, 1875.REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.I WILL call the attention of the congregation to a few verses in the ##Matthew 25:1-13|25th chapter## of St. Matthew. [Thespeaker read the first thirteen vers-es; also the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth paragraphs of the ##Doctrine and Covenants 45:56-59|fourteenth section## of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.]This revelation, a portion ofwhich I have been reading, treatsin a measure upon the subject of the parable that Jesus spoke, name-ly the ten virgins; both refer to his second coming and to his work in the latter days. In no age or dis-pensation can a man be called to a greater calling than to administer in the ordinances of the house ofGod; and nothing but the power of God and the inspiration of the Al-mighty can sustain and uphold any man, no matter what age he may live in, who is called of God to de-clare the words of life and salva-tion, and to preach repentance to an unbelieving generation. This mayperhaps sound strangely in the earsof many people, but the inhabi-tants of the earth, both Jew and Gentile, should remember that the Lord God Almighty himself, his Son Jesus Christ and his Gospel and work have been very unpopular inevery age of the world among the hosts of men. No more unpopular doctrine was ever presented to the human family than the doctrine of life and salvation. I do not care in what age of the world a pro-phet, apostle or inspired man has been raised up to declare the com-mands of God, he has had to con-tend with the prejudices of the in-habitants of the earth. It is so inour day, and it was so in the daysof Jesus Christ. When he came to the Jews, his own father's house,the house of Israel, as the greatshiloh of Judah, and the saviour of the world, a more unpopular man than he never dwelt in Judea or Jerusalem, from the day of his birth to the day of his death, when he gave up the ghost on the cross and went home to glory as a martyr for the word of God and the testimony which he bore. And this is why I say that when any man, in any age of the world, is called of God to declare the words of life, he has to contend with the traditions of ages that rest upon the minds of the inhabitants of the earth.The parable of the ten virgins is intended to represent the second coming of the Son of man, the com-ing of the Bridegroom to meet the bride, the church, the Lamb's wife, in the last days; and I expect that the Saviour was about right when he said, in reference to the mem-bers of the church, that five of them were wise and five were fool-ish; for when the Lord of heaven comes in power and great glory toreward every man according to the deeds done in the body, if he finds one half of those professing to be members of his church prepared for salvation, it will be as many as can be expected judging by the course that many are pursuing.I wish, if I can get enough of the Spirit of the Lord to answer my own mind, to say a few words on the present occasion to my breth-ren and sisters, the Latter-day Saints, those who have taken upon them the name of Christ. We live in one of the most important dis-pensations that God ever gave to man, namely the great and last dis-pensation of the fulness of times, the dispensation of all dispensa-tions, and the one in which the whole flood of prophecy in the holy Bible will be fulfilled, for most all of the prophecies contained in thatsacred volume, from Adam to John the Revelator, point to the great work of God in the last days, the days in which the God of heaven would set up a kingdom that should be an everlasting kingdom and to whose dominion there should be no end, and the kingdom and thegreatness of the kingdom under the whole heavens should be given into the hands of the Saints of the Most High God, and they are topossess it for ever and ever. I wish to have the Latter-day Saints un-derstand their appointment, posi-tion and responsibility before the God of heaven, and their responsi-bilities to both Jew and Gentile, living and dead, on this and the other side of the vail.The Lord never has built up his kingdom in any age of the worldexcept by calling upon his servantsand laboring through the taberna-cles of men on the earth; but thishe has done in a great many ages and dispensations. And wheneverthe Lord has had an apostle, pro-phet or inspired man on the earthhe has had power to administer in the ordinances of the house of God,and he has labored for the advance-ment of the kingdom of God upon the earth, whether he has had few or many followers. As it was in the days of Noah and Lot so shallit be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man. We live in the day when God has set his hand to establish that great kingdom thatDaniel saw. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] We live in the day when the angel of God has deliv-ered the everlasting Gospel in ful-filment of the ##Revelation 14:6-7|revelations## of St.John, when he says—"I saw an-other angel flying though the midstof heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach to them who dwell on the earth, to every nation, kin-dred, tongue and people under the whole heavens, saying with a loud voice 'Fear God and give glory tohim, for the hour of his judgment is come.'"There never was a generation ofthe inhabitants of the earth in any age of the world who had greater events awaiting them than the present. As I before remarked, the fulfilment of this whole volume of revelation points to our day. The building up of the kingdom of God, the building up of the Zion of Godin the mountains of Israel, the erection of a standard for the Gen-tiles to flee unto, the warning of the nations of the earth to prepare them for the great judgments ofour God, the building up of the church, the sanctifying of the peo-ple, the building of temples to theMost High God, that his servants may enter therein and become sa-viours on Mount Zion, redeeming both the living and the dead, all these things are to be performed in our day. And an age fraught withgreater interest to the children of men than the one in which we live never dawned since the creation of the world.Where is the man, priest or peo-ple, in the whole sectarian worldto-day, who believes in the literal fulfilment of the revelations of God contained in the Bible? If thereis one I should like to see and con-verse with him. The whole Chris-tian world profess to believe the Bible, and perhaps they do when it is shut. But open the Bible and read the declarations contained therein concerning the last dispen-sation of the fulness of times, and where is the man who believes them? You can not find one, andit requires faith even among the Latter-day Saints to believe therevelations of God and to prepare themselves for those things which await the world.The fig trees are leaving, the summer is nigh, the signs of heav-en and earth all indicate the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ,but who are really looking and pre-paring for the coming of the great Bridegroom? I do not know thatany people on the earth, except theLatter-day Saints, are looking forthis great event. There may be exceptions, there may be men who believe in the second coming of Christ. The people called Miller-ites believe in the second coming of the Saviour, and they have set a great many days when it shouldtake place. But he did not come, and he never will come until therevelations of God are fulfilled and a people are prepared for his com-ing. He will never come until the Jews are gathered home and have rebuilt their temple and city, and the Gentiles have gone up there to battle against them. He will never come until his saints have built up Zion and have fulfilled the revela-tions which have been spoken con-cerning it. He will never come until the Gentiles throughout the whole Christian world have been warned by the inspired elders of Is-rael. They are called to thrust in the sickle and reap, for the harvest is ripe and the time has come, which is referred to in this revelation, when the Lord commands the el-ders to go forth and warn the world for the last time, and call upon the inhabitants of the earth to repent. And what I wish to say to the el-ders and to the Latter-day Saintsis—Have we faith in God and inhis revelations? Have we faith in our own religion? Have we faith in Jesus Christ? Have we faith in the words of the Prophets? Have we faith in Joseph Smith, who, by the aid of the Urim and Thum-mim, translated the Book of Mor-mon, giving a record of the ancient inhabitants of this country, and through whom the Lord gave the revelations contained in the Bookof Doctrine and Covenants? If we have faith in these things, then we certainly should prepare ourselves for the fulfillment of them. I con-sider that as a people and as elders of Israel we occupy one of the mostimportant positions ever occupied on the face of the earth by thosewho have been called to work for the Lord. We have received our appointment for this work, and we should prepare ourselves to perform the duties devolving upon us in connection with it. Truth is oneof the attributes of the Lord, and he never makes a declaration but what is certain and true. And, as one of the apostles says, "There is no prophecy of any private inter-pretation, but holy men of old spake as they were moved upon bythe Holy Ghost;" therefore what they said is true, and their prophe-cies will have their fulfilment. [##2 Peter 1:20-21##] Noman can point to any of the reve-lations of God in the old prophetsconcerning events up to our day,but what have had their fulfilment. Everything that Jesus Christ spake concerning Judea and Jerusalem has had its fulfilment to the veryletter. The temple at Jerusalem was overthrown until not one stone was left upon another, and the Jews have been scattered and trod-den under the foot of the Gentiles now for eighteen hundred years, and so they will remain until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled, and that is pretty near. [##Matthew 24:1-2##] And, as the Lord has told us in these reve-lations, we are called upon to warn the world.We have been laboring now for forty-five years in preaching the gospel of Christthroughout the Gentile nations. We say Gentiles, because the gospel goes to the Gentiles first, that the first may be lastand the last first. Anciently the Jews were first in having the Gospel sent unto them, but they rejected it, and they were broken off through unbelief, and hence the Gospel turned to the Gentiles; and, as Paul says—"Ye Gentiles, take heed and fear, lest ye fall through the same exam-ple of unbelief, for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed also lest he spare not ye." [##Romans 11:20-21##] The Gentiles are fallen through the same example of unbelief as did the Jews. They have put to death every prophet, apostle and inspired man since the days of Jesus Christ, and the church went into the wilderness, and the face of a prophet, apostle or inspired man, called of God to administer the ordinances of the gospel, had not been seen for some eighteen hundred years, until the Lord raised up a prophet in the day and age in which we live. Therefore the gospel brought forth in the last days has to goto the Gentiles first.Sometimes our neighbors and friends think hard of us because we call them Gentiles; but, bless your souls, we areall Gentiles. The Latter-day Saints are all Gentiles in a national capacity. The gospel came to us among the Gentiles.We are not Jews, and the Gentile nationshave got to hear the Gospel first. Thewhole Christian world have got to hear the gospel, and when they reject it, the law will be bound and the testimony sealed,and it will turn to the house of Israel. Up to the present day we have been called to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles, and we have had to do it. For the last time we have been warning the [w]orld, and we havebeen engaged in that work for forty-five years.When Joseph Smith was called of Godit required faith, inspiration and the pow-er of the Almighty to rest upon him to enable him to organize the church and kingdom of God and to preach the gospelagainst the traditions of the Christian world, for they had spiritualized the Bible until there was not a remnant left in a lit-eral point of view. Hence the inhabitantsof the earth were not looking for the church and kingdom of God to be estab-lished in their midst. Darkness has pre-vailed upon the earth, and does to-day, in all the nations, and this causes silence to reign and all eternity is pained because of the sin, wickedness and abominations which prevail throughout the whole Chris-tian or Gentile world, and throughout the whole Jewish world, for darkness prevails upon the face of all the earth, and the Lord is calling upon all the inhabitants thereof to repent and receive the gospel,and when they have done so to gather outof Babylon to the place he has appointed for the dwelling place of his Saints. The Latter-day Saints heard this Gospel among the Gentiles wherever they dwelt, in al[-]most every nation under heaven, and by this Gospel we have been gathered out un-to Zion. We have been gathered here for a certain purpose, and that purpose is to fulfill the revelations of God.When we left Missouri and Nauvoo, leaving behind the graves of our fathers and children, we were driven by our ene-mies into this desert, in the expectation that we should perish, and for nothingbut because we believed revelation andprophecy and in living prophets and ser-vants of God. We thought it was hard to be driven from our homes and lands, which we had bought of our government, and paid the money for: but I will say to the Latter-day Saints that if we had not come here there certainly would have been a flood of prophecy fallen unfulfilled, pro-phecy in regard to the mountains of Israel,and the great company gathering up there-to, with regard to the lifting up of a stan-dard therein, and the building of citiesand the temple of God in their midst.All these things would have fallen unful-filled if we had not come to these moun-tains and fulfilled them. And so with many other prophecies. We have been called together to perform the work of the Lord, and now the Lord looks to us to fulfill our covenants and keep his com-mandments. If we do this he has made great promises unto us. The Lord hasgiven the holy priesthood unto the elders of Israel, and he requires at our hands to fulfill all these revelations and command-ments; and in regard to the parable which I have read, I, as an individual, feel that it is necessary for me, and I may say that it is necessary for the whole people, to have oil in our lamps if we expect to see and comprehend the things of the king-dom of God.The Lord has chosen a royal priesthood and a holy people from among the weak things of the world, in fulfilment of his revelations; and we have been command-ed to go forth and bear record of thesethings, and we have done it. We should have been condemned and the curse of God would have rested upon us if we hadnot, because the full set time has come to build up and favor Zion, to build up thekingdom of God, to warn the world and prepare them for the judgments of the Almighty. The Millennium is dawning upon the world, we are at the end of the sixth thousand year, and the great day of rest, the Millennium of which the Lord has spoken, will soon dawn and the Sa-viour will come in the clouds of heaven to reign over his people on the earth one thousand years. The Lord has a great work ahead and he is preparing a people to do it before his coming. Now the ques-tion arises here, brethren and sisters, arewe prepared in our hearts? Do we realize these things? As a people do we realizeour responsibilities before the Lord? TheLord has raised up a kingdom of priestshere in the last days to establish his church and kingdom, and to prepare the way for the second coming of the Son of Man, and the God of heaven has put into the hands of his servants the keys of the kingdom, and he has said—"Whatever I have decreed in these my servants shall be fulfilled, for to them is given power to bind and to seal both on the earth and in heaven, against the day of the wrath of Almighty God, which is to be poured out upon the world." [##Doctrine and Covenants 1:7-9##]I think, many times, that we, as elders of Israel and as Latter-day Saints, come far short of realizing our position before the Lord. The work required at our hands is great and mighty; it is the workof Almighty God. We are held responsi-ble for presenting the gospel of Christ toall the nations of the earth, to warn the Gentiles, to prepare for the return of thelost ten tribes of Israel and for carrying the gospel to the whole twelve tribes of Israel. We are held responsible for allthis and for building temples to the MostHigh, wherein we can enter and attend to ordinances for the salvation of our dead.There are fifty thousand million spiritsshut up in the spirit world who never saw the face of a prophet, apostle or inspiredman in their lives. No man having the authority of God ever declared the wordsof life and salvation unto them, and with-out authority their ministrations are use-less, for this is what the priesthood is for. The God of heaven has ordained this from eternity to eternity. These persons in the spirit world died in the flesh without the law, without the gospel, and they are shut up in prison. Joseph Smith ispreaching to them, and so are thousands of the elders of Israel who have diedand gone to the other side of the vail. George A. Smith, who dwelt with us untilwithin the last few days, will take part,with joy and rejoicing, with his brethren in the great work the other side of the vail. When I saw ten or twelve thousand people met in this Tabernacle to pay their last respects to the body of that man, Ithought to myself—"How much larger a congregation surrounds his spirit, in the spirit world." Yes, they number millionsthere to where we have units here, and the servants of God will preach to them the same as Jesus preached to the spirits in prison. While his body lay three days and nights in the tomb he went and preached to the spirits in prison, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, that they might receive part in the resurrection, according to the testimony which they received. As I said before, the God of heaven requires this at your hands. They will not baptize anybody in the spir-it world; there is no baptism there, there is no marrying or giving in marriage there; all these ordinances have to be performedon the earth. Paul says, in referring to this subject—"Why are ye baptized forthe dead? If the dead rise not why then are ye baptized for the dead?" [##1 Corinthians 15:29##] The Lord holds us responsible for going to and building temples, that we may attendtherein to the ordinances necessary for the salvation of the dead.In every dispensation the Lord has had those who were before ordained to do a certain work. We all dwelt in the pres-ence of God before we came here, and such men as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the an-cient prophets, Jesus and the apostles re-ceived their appointments before the world was made. They were ordained before the foundation of the world to come and tab-ernacle here in the flesh and to work forthe cause of God, and this because of their faith and faithfulness. You can see the great variety of spirits that have dwelt inthe presence of God, from those who are in the presence of God, down to the dev-ils. A good many of the hosts of heavenwere cast out because of their wickedness. Lucifer, son of the morning, and those who followed after him were cast down to earth, and they dwell here to this day—ahundred to every man, woman and child that breathes the breath of life. They dwell here without bodies, only what tab-ernacles they can get into, to rule and pre-side over.We are required to build temples inwhich to attend to the ordinances of the house of the Lord, that the prison doors may be opened, and the prisoners go free. The world say—"We do not believe in such stuff." We know that perfectly well: it was so in the days of Noah and Lot, but the unbelief of the people did not stop the flood and the fire, neither will the unbelief of this generation stay the hand of God one moment. The an-gels of God have been waiting in the tem-ple in heaven for forty-five years to goforth to reap down the earth. The wheatand the tares must grow together until harvest; the people must be warned, the Saints gathered out, Zion built up, tem-ples reared, the living warned, the dead redeemed, that the skirts of the elders of Israel may be clean before all men.It is by the power of God that the elders have been sustained in the days past and gone. And I want to say to my brethren—andwhat I say to them I take to myself—we should wake up, we should open our eyesto see, our ears to hear, and we should open our hearts to understand our ap-pointment and position before the Lord;for if, as Latter day Saints, we are going to stop praying, lose the light of the Ho-ly Ghost, and turn to the beggarly ele-ments of the world, the Lord will have to say to us—"Get out of my way, my pur-poses can not be thwarted;" and he will raise up somebody else to perform thiswork. The Lord has never told any lies or made any false promises. "Who am I," saith the Lord, "that I promise and do not fulfill?" "Who am I," saith the Lord, "that I command and am not obeyed?" The amount of it is that thepromises of the Lord are yea and amen, and though the heavens and the earth pass away his word never will fail of its fulfilment.In one paragraph of the revelation which I read to you this afternoon it says—"And again, the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven, saying, hearken, Oye nations of the earth, and hear the words of that God who made you. O, ye na-tions of the earth, how often would I have gathered you together as a hen gath-ereth her chickens under her wings, butye would not? How oft have I called up-on you by the mouth of my servants, and by the ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of thunder-ings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice of famines and pestilen-ces of every kind, and by the great sound of a trump, and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of mercy all the day long, and by the vocie of glory and honor, and the riches of eternal life, and would have saved you with an everlasting salva-tion, but ye would not? Behold the day has come when the cup of the wrath of mine indignation is full." [##Doctrine and Covenants 43:23-26##]How often has the Lord sent prophets, as in the days of Noah, Lot, Abraham, Enoch, Jesus Christ, Joseph Smith and Brigham Young? How often have the elders of Israel lifted up their voices to the inhabitants of the earth and been re-jected? Will not these things rise in judg-ment against them? Yea verily they will. The Lord has offered the fulness of the everlasting Gospel to the inhabitants of the earth to-day, and they refuse to re-ceive it. Brother Pratt, here, myself and thousands of us have travelled ten thou-sand miles on foot, without purse or scrip, carrying our knapsack or valise, and we have waded swamps, swam rivers, and begged our bread from door to door topreach the gospel to this generation. And how many have we got to believe it? Two of a city and one of a family, as the prophet has said, and we have gathered them to Zion. Nevertheless the warning voice has gone forth to the world. But what do we see to-day? What do the Gods, the heavens and all eternity see? They see a generation of men and women making war against God and his Christ,making war against prophets and apostles,and laboring night and day to overpower and annihilate every principle of salvation and eternal life which God has restored to the world. And I will here say, in the ears of this congregation, that were this not the dispensation of the fulness of times, and were it not for the decrees which the Lord has made in relation to it,one of which is that he will set up a king-dom which shall stand for ever, there isnot an apostle or Latter-day Saint on the face of the earth but would have to sealhis testimony with his blood, as has al-most every other apostle that ever breath-ed the breath of life. I say that were it not for these things we should all have to follow our leaders, Joseph and Hyrum Smith, who laid down their lives for theword of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. But hear it ye Gentile nations and all ye nations of theearth, the Lord Almighty has set to his hand to build up his kingdom on theearth, and he will not be thwarted. The Lord is going to make a short work in the earth, and he will defend his anointed, his prophets, his Zion and his people. This is the decree of Almighty God. The eyes of all heaven are over this people, they are over the earth, over the Gentiles and over the Jews, and the Lord holds in his hands the destinies of all men. And we are com-manded of God to rise up and warn the nations of the earth; and we call upon the Latter-day Saints, upon the elders ofIsrael, upon the mothers and daughters in Zion to lay aside their fooleries and non-sense, and to no longer let their hearts be set upon the fashions of the world, but turn to and read the Bible, the Book of Mormon and the revelations of God given in these days, and get the Holy Spirit andwalk in the light of the Lord, that your eyes may be opened that you may see andcomprehend the position you occupy on the earth, for you are held under great respon-sibility for the manner in which you do your duty and magnify your callings before

 AN EXPLANATION TO THE PUBLICThere have been many communica-tions of late in the newspapers concern-ing Colonel Isaac Trumbo and his af-fairs. Charges have been made, ema-nating from various sources, that there has been some financial connection be-tween himself and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It hasbeen repeatedly stated in years past,and the story has been revived of late, that Colonel Trumbo has had largeamounts of money in his hands and under his control belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; that he has been its agent inthe expenditure of funds for the ac-complishment of certain ends that weredesired to be achieved.We have remained silent upon this subject. It is well known that from time to time charges are made and circulated concerning us and our af-fairs, which we deem it unnecessary to notice. It would be occupying too much of our time to be contradictingstories which are put in circulation by one and another for their own purposes.This feeling has restrained us in thepast in relation to Colonel Trumbo and his connection with us and our affairs.But it seems to be proper now, and justto ourselves, as well as common justice to him, that we should say something in relation to the association that hasexisted between Colonel Isaac Trumbo and ourselves as the representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.First of all, we wish to state most emphatically that Colonel Trumbo has not had property of ours in his pos-session for such purposes as alleged. He has neither been our financial agent, nor had any control of our property. We have not entrusted him with amounts of money to expend for us for any such purposes.In the time of our deep distress, whenbitterness and hatred were manifested against us in almost every public quarter, Colonel Isaac Trumbo came to Utah, and showed interest, in our af-fairs. Some of his own relatives were involved in cases that were then beforethe courts. One prominent connectionof his was consigned to the peniten-tiary, on the common charge that wasin vogue against so many prominent Latter-day Saints. The colonel's sym-pathies, it seems, were aroused, at leastin behalf of his kinsfolk. This causedhim to take interest in the whole ques-tion; and this interest absorbed him tosuch an extent that he withdrew from profitable business that he had at thetime in San Francisco, and devoted himself almost exclusively to the laborof correcting the false impressionswhich prevailed and to the enlistment of the press in the correction of the many falsehoods and aspersions which were in circulation; and afterwards, on a wider field, using his influence with leading men of the nation. Wemay say here that Colonel Isaac Trum-bo is a man of extraordinary energy. When he undertakes anything that hethinks ought to be done, he is untiringin his efforts to accomplish it. These characteristics were wonderfully illus-trated in the labors which he took upon himself in behalf of the maligned andmisrepresented Latter-day Saints. Be-ing a man of means, he was able to travel from place to place, and especial-ly to visit and sustain himself at Washington. We can never forget his activity in visiting editors and using his influence to correct public opinion through the press. No man could have displayed great-er zeal and disinterestedness than he did in the labors that he took upon himself. We felt that he was inspired;for, not being a member of our religious organization, and having no financial ends to accomplish that would be re-munerative to him, there was nothingto incite him to these extraordinary ex-ertions except a purely philanthropic desire to defend an oppressed and un-popular people and to roll back the tide of calumny and evil that threatened tooverwhelm them. We felt thankfulmany times for the kind Providence which raised him up; for he seemed tocome to our aid at a time when a manin his position and with his indefatiga-ble energy was especially needed.When the Mormon people were threatened with disfranchisement, Col.Trumbo spent considerable time in Washington, exerting himself to the utmost of his ability to defeat that in-famous measure. And while there wereother agencies also at work (for every-one that had any influence in the com-munity realized how necessary it was that this measure should be defeated),still Colonel Isaac Trumbo was the means of bringing powerful influences to bear against the enactment of that villainous bill. In the defeat of that proposed legislation every member of our Church had cause to be deeplygrateful to the Lord and to the instru-ments which, under Him, were the means of bringing it to naught.With the same zeal and devotedness he worked untiringly to obtain the am-nesty; and also afterwards in securing the return of the personal property tothe Church, and in preparing the way for the return of the real estate.He threw himself into the accom-plishment of all these ends with an energy and wholeness of soul that won him many friends and crowned his labors and the labors of those whoworked with him with success.Colonel Trumbo was most fortun-ate in winning the respect and admiration of influential men in the na-tion. By his representations of the con-dition of things in the then Territory of Utah and his enthusiastic defense of the Mormon people, he aroused the ac-tive interest and sympathies of verymany of them. This was notably the case with General James S. Clarkson. This gentleman was deeply moved by all that he learned, and he entered with his whole soul and great influence, with Colonel Trumbo, into the effort to make the true character of the people known to the nation and to remove the wide-spread and deeprooted prejudices whichexisted so generally at that timeagainst the Mormon people. It wouldbe invidious perhaps to attempt to give names of other leading and influential public men who, by the powerful ap-peals which were made [to] them, were induced to examine what was knownas the Mormon question from a dif-erent standpoint to that which they had occupied; but their names are cherishedin grateful remembrance by the men of Utah, and their deeds will be pre-served in the history of the people. All the influence which he had gained by personal acquaintance Colonel Trumbo used to make the people of Utah betterknown to the nation at large, and towards preparing the way for the admission of Utah as a State. It is no[t]necessary for us to go into details concerning his labors in this direction; i[t] is sufficient to say that probably no sin-gle agency contributed so much to making Utah a State as the labors of Colonel Isaac Trumbo and his immedi-ate friends.WILFORD WOODRUFF, GEORGE Q. CANNON, JOSEPH F. SMITH. 
 7 P.M.The priesthood meeting in the oldTabernacle was well attended, the building being completely filled. Bis-hops John Sharp and Edward Hunter,President D H. Wells and Elder Wil-ford Woodruff were the speakers, eachof whom spoke with great power, im-parting valuable instructions regarding the building of the Temples and kindred subjects. It was concluded to build aTemple in St. George, and, if possible, to complete the mason work of thesame during the coming winter. 
 THE YOUNG WOMAN'S JOURNAL.ceived his endowments. This then,should be recorded in the mind,and in the private journal of everyone, that President Woodruff andSister Bathsheba W. Smith, wereendowed and received their bless-ings of sealing and anointingsunder the hands of the ProphetJoseph Smith. There were manymore who likewise had this greatprivilege, but they are all dead,leaving only these two livingwitnesses.President Woodruff was filledwith the power and influence ofthe Holy Ghost on this occasion,so much so that is not only thrilledhis own voice, but shook the hearts of his hearers. He beganhis remarks by saying: "I shouldnot try to speak to this congrega-tion tonight, as I have spokentwice before today; but there are duties resting upon me that Imust attend to. And I want to ask this congregation a question: When I have the vision of thenight opened continually beforemy eyes, and can see the mightyjudgments that are about to be poured out upon this world, when I know these things are true, andare at the door of Jew and Gen-tile; while I know they are true and while I am holding this position before God and this world, can I withhold my voice from lifting up a warning to this people, and to the nations of the earth? I may never meet with this people again; I cannot tellhow that may be. But while I live and see these things continu-ally before my eyes I shall raise my warning voice. Now, thequestion I wanted to ask you is this: We have fourteen millionpeople on this earth, and over them all there hangs a cloud of darkness almost entirely upon their shoulders. Can you tell me where the people are who will be shielded and protected from thesegreat calamities and judgments which are even now at our doors?I'll tell you. The priesthood ofGod who honor their priesthood, and who are worthy of their bless-ings are the only ones who shallhave this safety and protection.  They are the only mortal beings.  No other people have a right to be shielded from these judgments. They are at our very doors; not even this people will escape thementirely. They will come downlike the judgments of Sodom and Gomorrah. And none but the priesthood will be safe from their fury. God has held the angels ofdestruction for many years, lestthey should reap down the wheatwith the tares. But I want to tell you now, that those angels have left the portals of heaven, and they stand over this people and this nation now, and are hovering over the earth waiting to pour out the judgments. And from this very day they shall be poured out. Calamities and troubles are increasing in the earth, and there is a meaning tothese things. Remember this, and reflect upon these matters. If you do your duty, and I do my duty, we'll have protection, and shall pass through the afflictions 
 DISCOURSEBy Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF. Tabernacle,Sunday Morning. Dec. 1, 1861.REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.Brethren and sisters, I have been called upon and requested to occupy a portion of thetime this morning, and I can truly say that I always take pleasure, when I have an oppor-tunity, to bear my testimony of the work ofthe Lord in which we are engaged. I hopethat what little time I may speak that I maybe blessed with the Spirit of the Lord, that Imay speak of such things as will be edifying to you, for there is certainly not much advan-tage in talking to the people for the sake ofoccupying the time, unless it will be beneficialto us.I know that it is our duty, in this churchand kingdom, to live in such a manner that wemay feel interested in the things of the king-dom of our God. I reflect a great deal uponthe blessings which we are enjoying here inthe valleys of the mountains, and I oftenthink that I do not fully prize the blessings the Lord has imparted unto me. When I bringthese things to bear upon my mind, I realize,to a great extent, the necessity of prizing the gifts of the Holy Spirit bestowed upon me, and the same duty devolves upon all the saintsof God. If we can be made to rightly value the gifts which the Almighty bestows upon us, we shall certainly not do any thing that iswrong; we shall not walk where we ought not to walk, but we shall be devoted to the build-ing up of the kingdom of our God. If our eyes were opened to see things as they are,we should live and act as men of God. Whenmy mind is quickened by the Holy Spirit to comprehend the things of God, I feel verythankful for the light and intelligence be-stowed upon me by the Almighty. I feel satisfied that our president and leader would not be inspired to reprove and correct us as a people, as he is often moved upon to do, if wewere living to our privileges; we should not be exhorted to turn from the course that we arein to some other, if we were all doing just right. But I can say truly, brethren and sis-ters, that we are a blessed people, yes, we are blessed above all other people upon the earth. We have the kingdom of God here with us;we live in a dispensation and generation in which the kingdom has been built up, and itwill be permanently established never moreto be thrown down. In this dispensation the Lord has anointed men to preach the gospel to every creature. In every other dispensation the powers of darkness have in a great measure overcome the kingdom of God, or in other words have had dominion, so much so that the kingdom could not live but a little while; it could not grow and spread itselfupon the earth, and finally that power which was acting through the agency of the childrenof men, even the holy priesthood, was takenhome to God, and it has remained there from generation to generation, and the world havebeen without these blessings for many hun-dreds of years. This has been the difficultyever since the creation of the world. Even when Christ came and established the gospelupon the earth, it was here but a little seasonbefore the devil, the arch-enemy of the king-dom of God, overcame those who held thepriesthood, so that the priesthood and author-ity of the kingdom was taken from the earth, and the Church went into the wilderness, leaving the people without any inspired men to say this is the way; walk ye in it. From that time until the introduction of the fulness of the gospel by the Prophet Joseph in our own day and age of the world, there hasbeen no Peter or Philip, nor any other man to teach the people the way of life and salvation,but they have had to live by the best laws of morality which they knew; hence the division and contention that has existed in the sectar-ian world.But we have had the privilege of living inthe dispensation in which the Lord has pro-mised that he would establish his kingdom, and perfect it ready for the appearance of the Great Bridegroom.This is the privilege which we enjoy as Latterday Saints. When the time has come, ac-cording to the decree of the Almighty, an angel visited the earth and committed the priesthood to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cow-dery, and gave them instructions and a pro-mise that they should be inspired to lay itbefore the people. We have embraced this gospel, and the Spirit of God enlightens ourminds so that we comprehend, by the inspira-tion of the Almighty, those principles that are necessary for our present and eternal salva-tion; and by receiving the principles of life in our minds, we were led to come to the valleysof the mountains. We can all now compre-hend that this is the Church and kingdom ofour God, that he has established, to remain forever; therefore, instead of being given up to those evil principles and practices that reign in the hearts of the children of men, we are walking in the path of life, and those truths are now uppermost in our minds. We are constantly striving to spread abroad this truth, that the hearts of the children of men may be inspired to take hold and help this kingdom to take root and spread abroad untilit shall entirely overcome that power whichhas always, in past ages, overcome the kingdom of God. It is a blessing to us, to the whole house of Israel, and to the Gentile nations; itis a blessing that the world never before have enjoyed. It is true that other dispensations have had their prophets and apostles, but theynever enjoyed the privilege that we do of having the kingdom of God continue upon theearth until it triumphs over all other king-doms upon the face of the earth, and stands forever. Former apostles and prophets had theunpleasant reflection that the Church which they had built up would fall away, or be overcome by the power of the devil and wicked men,and that when they passed off the earth andwent behind the vail, they would have to take the priesthood with them, because there wouldbe none living worthy to receive it from under their hands. They will be crowned with the Saviour according to the promises, but in their lifetime they never had the opportunity of planting on the earth a kingdom that should remain until Jesus should reign as King of kings and Lord of lords. Lucifer has gained possession of the earth by overcoming the children of men; but it does not belong to him, although he has had possession of it for a great many generations. I rejoice that the day is dawning when the principles of right-eousness and truth will bear rule and bring forth fruit, until the kingdom and the dominion shall be given to the saints of the Most High, and the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our God and his Christ.The very idea of our becoming co-workerswith Jesus Christ ought to inspire every oneof us with a determination to aid all we can in this dissemination of those great and glori-ous principles that are calculated to exalt the human family from their low and degraded positions to the favour of God, angels, andmen. This is the way I feel in relation to the Church and kingdom of which we aremembers.These blessings are above the blessings of the riches and comforts of life that we are allseeking after; they are far more valuable andmore lasting than any other blessing in this life. Man may have earthly wealth andhonour, but his life is not his own; he has not the power to prolong his life one day; and when he dies, his honour, his wealth, and all that he possesses in this life, passes away. He receives nothing in this world of riches or honor that he can carry with him, and excepthe stores his mind with knowledge and obeys the fulness of the Gospel, he cannot have the blessings of a clear conscience and the com-forts of the Holy Ghost. The rich man, the rulers of the land, the kings and potentates ofthe earth, no matter what they possess, whenthey die they can take nothing with them;they came into the world naked, and they gointo the spirit world as poor as the poor man who lives and dies in rags. Then all theiracts of greatness and affluence sink into ob-livion, but still the Lord may hold the kings, rulers and potentates of the earth responsiblefor their official acts.When an apostle, or president, bishop, or any man holding the priesthood officiates, he ad-ministers by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, then that priesthood has effect, and all the blessings that a servant of God bestows upon the children of men, will take effect both in this life and in that which is to come. If I have a blessing given to me by the holy priest-hood, or if I receive a blessing from a pa-triarch, those gifts and blessings will reach into the other world; and  if I am true to my covenants through this life, I can claim every blessing that has been conferred upon me, be-cause that authority by which they were con-ferred is ordained of God, and it is that bywhich the sons of the Most High administer unto the children of men the ordinances of life and salvation;,and those official acts willhave their effect upon those persons beyond the grave as well as in this life. These are the true riches; they are riches that will last to all eternity, and we have power through these blessings, conferred by the gospel, to receive our bodies again, and to preserve our identity in eternity. Yes, we can claim this by virtue of the holy priesthood, but it is notso in the world. There is not a priest in theworld that has administered one of the ordi-nances of the gospel since the priesthood was taken away, because, properly speaking, there can be no ordinance of the gospel administer-ed without the authority of the priesthood;hence I say that from the time the priesthood was taken from the earth until Joseph received it again from the angel of the Lord, there was no gospel ordinances legally administered. I admit, however, that all men will be rewarded according to the deeds done in the body and they will be judged according to the lightwhich was given to them. This will be the condition of all who are not called and ordain-ed of God, notwithstanding they may haveadministered what they believe to be the ordi-nances of the gospel; yet their administra-tions will have no effect beyond the vail.When we bring this subject home and con-sider the difference between the blessings ofthe gospel as revealed in its fulness and puri-ty, and being shut out from the light of heav-en, from the revelations of the Almighty, from the administration of Angels and fromthe voice of God, we ought to prize our priv-ileges and blessings as Saints far more than we have done heretofore. Mankind in allages search for happiness, they desire social and domestic peace; and when they think ofthe vast future, they desire to participate in the blessings which are spoken of as pertaining to that state of existence, but they know nothow to obtain them, except a servant of God comes along and points out the way of life. We have the way open before us, and the gift of eternal life, which is the greatest gift of God, is promised unto us on condition that we will continue in well-doing, but we can attain to that through no other means than strict obe-dience to the commandments of God.I refer to these things, brethren and sisters,because I think we do not sufficiently prize the great responsibility that we are under to God and to this generation. It is indeed a great responsibility which the Lord lays upon a man when he calls him to the ministry and sends him to declare to the people that he iscommissioned to preach the gospel and ad-minister the ordinances by which they can be saved, secure a part in the first resurrection, and inherit thrones and dominions in the pres-ence of God and the Lamb. We have re-ceived this gospel, and many of the Eldershave gone forth, having been called of God as was Aaron, and they have offered the truth to the nations of the earth, a few have re-ceived the message, but the vast majority have rejected it, and they are condemned. [##Hebrews 5:4##] The Lord told Oliver Cowdery that if he la-bored in the vineyard and brought in but one soul, his reward should be great. Then con-sider how great our reward will be when yousee hundreds and thousands gathering into 
 216 THE DESERET NEWS. May 22REMARKS,By Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF,Delivered in the New Tabernacle,Salt Lake City, Ap[r]il 8th, 1872.REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.WE have had a very good Conference; we have heard a great deal of testimony from the servants of the Lord, and that testimony has been true. The building up of the Zion of God in these latter days includes, Imay say of a truth, every branch of busi-ness, both temporal and spiritual, in whichwe are engaged. We can not touch upon any subject which is lawful in thesight of God and man, that is not embraced in our religion. The gospel of Jesus Christ which we have embraced, and whichwe preach, includes all truth, and everylawful calling and occupation of man. One subject that we are deeply interested in Iwish to say a few words upon. In the first place I wish to give notice in this stage ofmy remarks to the members of the DeseretAgricultural and Manufacturing Society,that they are requested to meet, atthe close of this meeting, at the Historian'sOffice, to appoint their president and board of directors for the coming season, for thetimes demand that we should hold a Statefair in this city this fall.Strangers may think this a very strange subject to present in a religious meeting, but we are building up the literal kingdomof God on the earth, and we have temporal duties to perform. We inhabit temporal bodies, we eat temporal food, we build temporal houses, we raise temporal cattleand temporal wheat; we contend with tem-poral weeds, and with temporal enemies inour soil, and these things naturally give rise to the necessity of attending to and performing many duties of a temporal andarduous nature, and they, of course, are embraced in our religion. In building up the Zion and kingdom of God in these lat-ter days, our agricultural and manufactur-ing interests are of the most vital import-ance; in fact manufacturing and agricultu-ral pursuits are of vital importance to any nation under heaven. Show me a nationwhose people cultivate the earth, and manufacture what they need, and I willshow you a rich and independent nation.Show me a nation that lives entirely by mining and I will show you a poor nation—one that is ready to run out and become obsolete. You see this manifest in thehistory of all nations under heaven. What gives England her wealth to-day? Her coal, iron, and the products of her soil, in connection with her prodigious manufac-tures; and it is so with all the nations of the earth. What makes the United States what she is to-day? Her products and thecultivation of her soil, and the constantefforts she has made to supply the wants ofher people. Not but what mining is all right, there is no fault with the develop-ment of the resources of the earth under favorable circumstances. When we came here our position demanded that the very first thing we did was to plant our potatoesand sow our wheat, or we had starvationbefore us; and I will here say that theSaints and the Elders of Israel have gone before the Lord day after day and week af-ter week, and prayed the Almighty to hideup the treasures of these mountains, lest even the Latter-day Saints, with all thefaith they had, should be tempted to turn away from the cultivation of the earth and the manufacture of what they needed; and the Lord heard our prayers, and we dwelt here many years and filled these val-leys for six hundred miles with cities,towns, villages, gardens, orchards, fields, vineyards, hundreds of school-houses, and places of worship, until we made the desert blossom as the rose, and had a supply of wheat, bread and clothing upon our hands. Then, I do not know but the Elders ceased praying for the Lord to hide up the treas-ures of the earth, I guess they did, for very soon after mines began to be opened, and now silver mines are being worked in many parts of the Territory. A few years ago General Connor and others, who dwelthere, with soldiers under them, spent verymany days in prospecting these mountains from one end to the other for gold and sil-ver, but they could find none; to-day you may go over the same places, and if youdig into the earth you may find plenty of silver, and you may find it almost any-where in these mountains. I suppose thisis all right, I have no fault to find with it; but I still say that the interest of the Lat-ter-day Saints in these mountains is to cultivate the soil and to manufacture what they use.Through the influence of President Young we have many manufactories for wool and cotton already established in this Territory. He has done more than any man living in these last days, according to the means he has had at his command, to establish these branches of business in the midst of these mountains. We have now many large factories in this Territorythat have to stand still for want of wool. I want to say a few words on this subject tothe wool growers of Deseret. Instead of sending our wool out of the Territory, to eastern States to be manufactured into cloth, and purchasing it and paying eastern manufacturers a large percentage for it when brought here by railroad, I feel that it is our duty, and it would be far wiser for us, to sell our wool to those who own factories in this Territory, and to sustainourselves by sustaining home manufac-tures.One of the first commands given to Adam, after being placed in Eden, was todress the garden; and he was permitted to eat of the fruit of every tree except one. After a while Adam and his wife, Eve, partook of the fruit of this tree, and the his-tory of the Fall is before us and the world. After Adam was cast out of the garden the Lord told him that there should be a curse on the earth, and instead of bringing forth beautiful flowers, fruit and grain spontane-ously, as before the Fall, it should bring forth thorns, briers, thistles and noxious weeds,and that man should earn his bread by the sweat of his brow; and from that time to the present mankind has had this curse to contend with in the cultivation of the earth. In consequence of this the inhabit-ants of Utah, in their agricultural operations have to fight against the cockle burr, the black seed and sunflower, as well as thorns and thistles and many other noxious weeds, which, if not eradicated, speedily take ad-vantage of us, and to a great extent, mar the result of our labors. It will pay us to pay attention to these things; it will pay us to dress the earth, to till it, to take care of and spend time and means in manuring and feeding it; it will pay us to gather out these noxious weeds, for the earth will then have a chance to bring forth in its strength. This, with the blessing of God upon our labors, has made the soil of Utahas productive as it is to-day. I wish to see this interest increase in our midst; and I hope, in addition to this, that those who are raising sheep—our wool growers—will pay attention to and carry on that branch of business systematically, and that we will sell our wool to those who manufacture it at home, instead of sending it out of the Territory to be manufactured. I feel that this is our duty and the course which will promote our best interests, and it is a prin-ciple which is true, independent of relig-ion, in any community or nation: it is a self-sustaining principle.God has blessed us, he has blessed the earth, and our labors in the tilling of the soil have been greatly prospered. As has been said by some of our brethren in their remarks, when the pioneers came here, no mark of civilization or of the white man, was found. If those who are now so anxi-ous to obtain the homes we have made, had seen Utah as we saw it, they would never have desired a habitation here, but they would have got out of it as soon as they could. It was barren, desolate, abounding with grasshoppers, crickets and kiote wolves, and these things seemed to be the only natural productions of the soil. Wewent to work by faith, not much by sight,to cultivate the earth. We broke almost all the plows we had the first day. We had to let streams of water out to moisten the earth, and by experience we had to learn to raise anything. The stranger comesinto Salt Lake City and sees our orchards, and the trees in our streets, and he thinks, what a fruitful and delightful place it is. He does not think that, for twenty or twenty-four years, almost every tree he beholds, accord-ing to its age, has had to be watered twice a week through the whole summer season, or they would all have been dead long since. We have had to unite upon thesethings, the Lord has blessed our labors,and his mercies have been over this peo-ple.If we had not cultivated the earth, but had turned our attention to mining, weshould not only have starved to death our-selves, but thousands of strangers, whohave passed through, would have shared the same fate. Utah Territory has been the great highway to California, Nevada, and all the western States and Territories,and they have all looked, in a measure, to Utah for their bread. Nobody but Latter-day Saints would have lived here, and en-dured the trials and afflictions that we endured in the beginning; none otherswould have stayed and fought the crickets one year, as we had to do year after year. Any people but the Latter-day Saints would have left this country long ago. Not only so, on account of the things I have already named, but I will here say that noother people could have lived here, no, they would have knocked each others brains out on account of the little water they would have had in their irrigating opera-tions. When men saw their crops and trees withering and perishing for the want of water, the selfishness so general in the world would have worked up to such an extent, that they would have killed one another, and hence I say that none but Latter-day Saints would have stoo[d] it; butthey, by the training and experience theyhad before received, were prepared for the hardships and trials they had to encounter in this country.Brethren and sisters let us continue our efforts in cultivating the earth, and in manufacturing what we want. And I stillurge upon our Female Relief Societies, in this city and throughout the Territory, to carry out the counsel President Young gave us years and years ago, and try, as far as possible, within ourselves, to make ourown bonnets, hats and clothing, and to let the beauty of what we wear be the work-manship of our own hands. It is truethat our religion is not in our coat or bon-net, or it should not be. I[f] a man's reli-gion is there it is not generally very deep anywhere-else. But God has blessed us with the products of earth and the blessings of heaven, and his Spirit has been with us, we have been preserved; and the Lord hasturned away the edge of the sword, and he has protected us during many years past and gone, and we all have to acknowledgehis hand in these things.I do not wish to detain this conference. I felt as though I wanted to make a few re-marks on these subjects. I hope, brethren, that we will not slacken our hands with re-gard to the cultivation of the earth. In the prosecution of our labors in that respectwe have everything to contend with that man has been cursed with for five thousand years. We should clean our fields, as far as we can, of the noxious weeds, and our streets of sunflowers. These things en-cumber the earth. We have one difficulty to contend with, unknown save in those portions of the earth where irrigation is practiced. It is true that a man may clean his fields of sunflowers, cockle burrs,blackseed and every other noxious weedthat grows, and the very first time he waters his land here will come a peck or a bushel of foul seed from the mountains, and fill every field through which thestream flows. These difficulties we have to fight against, but we must do the best we can. As farmers, we should clean our seed, and not sow the foul along with the good. One man, in a few hours, with a good wire sieve, can sift enough seed for ten acres of land, and perhaps for twenty; while, to pull that bad seed out whengrown will cost from one to five hundred dollars, for it will take a score of men daysto do it. We should use our time, judg-ment and the wisdom God has given us tothe best advantage in all these things.I want the brethren to come together this afternoon and elect their officers, for we de-sire to hold a fair this fall, in which the agri-cultural and manufacturing interests of the Territory may be represented and interest-ed. Let us not be weary in well doing; let us not slacken our hands, either in cul-tivating the earth or in the manufacturing of what we need. Co-operate in agricul-tural and mercantile matters, also in our tanneries, and in the making of butter and cheese. One man may engage in these branches of business with advantage if hehave skill and experience to guide him; but in co-operation the wisdom of all is combined for the general good. This plan has been adopted with advantage in other communities, cities, States, Territories and countries, and it can be in this more ex-tensively than it has been hitherto.I pray that God will bless us, and bless this whole people; and I pray that the tes-timony which we have received here dur-ing this Conference, which is true, may notbe forgotten by us. I can bear the same tes-timony. I know this work is of God. I know Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God. I have heard two or three of the brethren testify about brother Young in Nauvoo.Every man and every woman in that assembly, which perhaps might numberthousands, could bear the same testimony. I was there, the Twelve were there, anda good many others, and all can bear the same testimony. The question might be asked why was the appearance of Joseph Smith given to Brigham Young? Becausehere was Sidney Rigdon and other men rising up and claiming to be the leaders of the Church; and men stood, as it were, on a pivot, not knowing which way to turn. But just as quick as Brigham Young rosein that assembly, his face was that of Jos-eph Smith—the mantle of Joseph had fallen upon him, the power of God that was uponJoseph Smith was upon him; he had the voice of Joseph, and it was the voice of the shepherd. There was not a person in that assembly, Rigdon, himself, not excepted, but was satisfied in his own mind that Brigham was the proper leader of the people, for he would not have his name presented, by his own consent, after thatsermon was delivered. There was a rea-son for this in the mind of God: it convinc-ed the people. They saw and heard for themselves, and it was by the power of God.May God bless you! May he give us wisdom to direct us in all things, and pro-mote all the interests of Zion for Jesus' sake. Amen.

 REMARKSBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVEREDAt the Semi-Annual Conference ofthe Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, in the NewTabernacle, Salt Lake City, Fri-day Morning, October 9th, 1874.REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.WE, as a people, have had a great deal of teaching and counsel in our day and gen-eration. Some of us have been taught in the things of this kingdom for over forty years, and, by this time, we ought to ex-ercise faith in the promises of God. Wehave looked forward to the fulfillment of the revelations which have been given inall ages and dispensations which are pastand gone; and we have not only expectedtheir fulfillment, but we have helped to fulfill a great many of them in the course of our lives. This work is the work of God, it is not the work of man. The Lord has set his hand in these last days in ful-fillment of revelation and prophecy and the promises which have been made forthousands of years past and gone, con-cerning the earth and the dispensations thereof.I will here say that all inspired men,from the days of father Adam to the daysof Jesus, had a view, more or less, of thegreat and last dispensation of the fulness of times, when the Lord would set hishand to prepare the earth and a people for the coming of the Son of Man and a reign of righteousness. One of the breth-ren was speaking here about the views en-tertained by some in the world who re-gard Christianity and the work of God as a failure. I will say that the work of the Lord has never been a failure and it never will. His purposes have to be accom-plished in the earth. There is one thing true with regard to the history and travels of the Saints of God in every age of the world—they have had to pass through trials, tribulations and persecutions, andhave had to contend with opposition, andthis will always be their fate until the power of evil is overcome. This is one of the legacies that is designed from God to the Saints while dwelling in the flesh among a world of devils, for the world is full of them, there are millions and mil-lions—all that were cast out of heaven; they never die, and they never leave the earth, but they dwell here and will con-tinue to do so until Satan is bound. As a people we have to meet this warfare, and the Saints of God have had to contend with it in every age of the world. Any man who undertakes to serve God has to round up his shoulders and meet it, and any man who will not trust in God and abidein his cause even unto death is not worthy of a place in the celestial kingdom. Said Jesus—"I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hate you—ifyou were of the world the world would love its own. They have hated me, they will hate you; and if they persecute me they will persecute you." [##John 15:16-20##] This is the legacy which all Saints may depend upon receiving. True, there has been a differ-ence in the various dispensations. This is the only dispensation that God has everestablished that was foreordained, before the world was made, not to be overcome by wicked men and devils. All other dis-pensations have been made war upon by the inhabitants of the earth, and the ser-vants and Saints of God have been mar-tyred. This was the case with Jesus and the apostles in their day. The Lord gave that good old prophet Enoch, President of the Zion of God, who stood in the midst of his people three hundred and sixty-five years, a view of the earth in its various dispensations, showing him that the time would come when it would groan under the wickedness, blasphemy, murders, whore-doms and abominations of its inhabitants. The prophet asked the Lord whether therewould ever be a time when the earth should rest; and the Lord answered that in the dispensation of the fulness of times the earth would fill the measure of its days, and then it would rest from wickedness and abominations, for in that day hewould establish his kingdom upon it, to be thrown down no more for ever. Then a reign of righteousness would commence and the honest and meek of the earth would be gathered together to serve theLord, and upon them would rest power tobuild up the great Zion of God in the lat-ter days. These things were also shown to Abraham, and many others of the an-cient servants of God had glimpses of them by vision, revelation and the inspi-ration of the Spirit of God, and what they saw, or an account of what they saw, has been left on record.This dispensation is one that all the pa-triarchs and prophets had their eye upon, and the Lord has commenced it, and has carried it on now for more than forty years, since this Church was organized with six members. We have not alto-gether traveled on beds of ease, we have had warfare and opposition from the com-mencement until this day; but we and theworld may set our hearts at rest concern-ing "Mormonism," for it will never ceaseuntil the Lord Jesus Christ comes in the clouds of heaven. This nation and othernations will war with the Saints of God until their cup is full; and when they be-come ripened in iniquity the Lord Al-mighty will cut them off, and the judg-ments of the Most High God will follow the testimony of the Elders of Israel.This is the way I look upon it. We are called upon to do our duty with regard to the subject which has been spoken of byBrothers Vancott and Cannon. What is this world I would like to know? What are the things of this world? What are houses and lands, goods and chattels, and the treasures of the earth generally, to us? What are they to any Saints of God com-pared with eternal life? We should cer-tainly be as well off to unite ourselves and our interests together in the things of God as to be separate. There have been too much selfishness and division and every man for himself amongst us, and the devilfor us all. Eternal life is worth more to a Saint of God than all things else puttogether, in fact it is the greatest gift God ever gave to man, or that he can give to him, and whatever the Lord requires at our hands we should be ready to do, indi-vidually and collectively.As I have often remarked in my testi-mony, from my youth up I had a desire to live to see a people rise up in the earth and contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints, who would receive and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ as it was taught in his day and generation. When I heard this Gospel I embraced it. The first sermon I ever heard the Spirit of God bore record to me that it was true, and Iwent forth and was baptized for the re-mission of my sins. I received the laying on of hands and the Lord gave me the Holy Ghost and a testimony, just the same as he gave to you, and to hundreds of thou-sands of those who have obeyed the gos-pel.It was but a short time after embracingthe work that I was called to go with my brethren a thousand miles for the redemp-tion of Zion. I went willingly, for I knew it was the work of God, it was what I had sought for from the time I was eight years old, what I had been taught in the Presby-terian Sunday School and what I had read in the New Testament in my father'shouse. From that time up I had looked for these things, and I had a testimony that I should live to see them, and I did,and when I embraced this Gospel my heartwas filled with joy and consolation; and as for this world, if I had the whole of it, I felt in those days as I feel now, it wouldnot stand in my path in seeking for eter-nal life.I was called to take my life in my hands and go up to Missouri, and a little hand-ful of us went up to redeem our brethren.We certainly had to go by faith. My neigh-bors called upon and plead with me not to go; said they—"Do not go, if you do you will lose your life." I said to them—"If I knew that I should have a ball put through my heart the first step I took in the Stateof Missouri I would go." I went, and I did not get shot, neither did any of therest of us, but we fulfilled the command-ment of God. That is the way I felt in those days with regard to the work of God, and that is the way I feel to-day. I am after salvation and eternal life, and I do not want anything to stand between me and that which I am in pursuit of. It doesnot make any difference what we as a peo-ple may be called to pass through. Men can go no further than they are permitted by the Lord. I have often remarked, and I repeat it, your destiny, the destiny of this nation, and the destiny of every king, prince, president, statesman and ruler un-der heaven are in the hands of the God of Israel. He made the world and all itsinhabitants, and they can go no further than they are permitted. If we unite our-selves according to the law of God we shall have far more safety than if we turn away from the commandments of the Lord and set our hearts upon the things of this world. If we forget God we are liable to be scourged; that is my feeling this morn-ing.This is the work of God. The Lord has set his hand to build up his kingdom, and be will do it whatever the consequencesmay be. Whatever the persecutions or difficulties his Saints may be called topass through, the Lord will never with-draw his hand, for he decreed, before the foundation of the world, that in the dis-pensation of the fulness of times his kingdom should be set up upon the earth,never more to be thrown down.The world has had its dispensations:we are at the end of the sixth thousand years, and are bordering upon the coming of the Son of Man in the cloudsof heaven, with power and great glory, to reward every man according to the deeds done in the body; and whatever the feel-ings of the world may be the Lord has de-creed a woe upon that man, that house, that nation or that people that rejects the testimony of his servants. The Lord says that he will hold a controversy with the nations, and judge the world with fireand sword, and he will plead with allflesh, and the slain of the Lord will bemany.  What if some of us do have tosacrifice our lives for the word of Godand the testimony of Jesus Christ? Whatof it? What is a man's life? The wholeworld will die. Armies, containing thou-sands of men, go forth for the honor ofbeing killed, in order to defend a king ora government. Is it any worse to die forthe word of God and the testimony ofJesus Christ than to die serving the devil?Not a particle. I glory in my feelings at the valiant spirit that is and has been manifested by the servants of the living God in the cause of truth and in defence of the great latter-day work. The Lord never raised up a better set of men and women since the world was than are they who have embraced the Gospel of Jesus Christ in these latter days. They have the testimony of Jesus Christ with them,and they have been called to pass through many trials thus far in the history and progress of the work of God. It is true that many have broken their covenants and turned away from the Lord, and thereason is that they stopped serving God and undertook to serve themselves, andthat led them into darkness. They re-jected the things of the kingdom of hea-ven, and the spirit of God was taken from them, and that class of people, in every age of the world is the darkest of any who ever breathe the breath of life. Theylose all confidence in every principle ofsalvation and eternal life revealed to man.With regard to our present position Iwant to say that it is the duty of every Saint of God in these valleys of the mountains to let his prayers ascend into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, day and night in the season thereof, in the fam-ily circle and in private places, for the Lord to sustain his people, build up Zion and fulfill his promises. We are in dutybound to fulfill ours, and the Lord will not fail now any more than he has any other time. He did not fail in the days of Jesus Christ, not a bit of it. Jesus waspoor, and from the manger to the cross,spent his whole life in the deepest pover-ty, suffering and affliction; he descended below all things that he might rise above all, and we are told that he had not money enough to pay his taxes to Caesar, and had to send Peter to catch a fish to get money for that purpose. He was poor all the way through his life. Is it any worse for you, or me, or any other Saintof God, to suffer persecution, affliction,poverty or trials than for our great Leader, President, Redeemer, King and Savior, who is going to come in the clouds of hea-ven? No, not a particle. As some of our brethren have said, there is need for us to repent and humble ourselves before the Lord our God, that we may have and en-joy more of the Holy Spirit to prepare usfor that which lies before us. It is our duty to unite together as a people; our temporal salvation lies in this, and we should not be backward in this matter. We should not only preach it, but be also ready to practise it; as leaders and as people, all should unite in carrying out that which is required of us. As an in-dividual I am not afraid of starving to death, I never was afraid of that in my life, and I have traveled a great many thousand miles to preach the Gospel without money and without price, and so have many of my brethren who are aroundme, and we never starved to death and we do not expect to. The amount of itis that everything we have here in thesevalleys of the mountains,—this Taberna-cle, this Temple, these public grounds, and all the cities and towns that have beenbuilt over six hundred miles of territory, are the gift of God to us. The Lord knows this country was barren enough when we came here, and a faithful peoplewere tried here with cricket and grass-hopper wars, until famine stared them in the face; but they trusted in God, andthey did not get disappointed.Our prayers should go up day and night in behalf of our Pesident, and the Presi-dency whom God has sustained from the beginning, and also for the leaders of the people and for each other. We should labor and pray for this. We are making history. The travels and experience of the Latter-day Saints have been as inter-esting as the history of any people in any dispensation since the world began. Jo-seph Smith was a Prophet of God, and he was called to lay the foundation of this kingdom; he was raised up from be-fore the foundation of the world for this purpose, and he came forth, through the loins of ancient Joseph who was sold into Egypt, and dwelt in the flesh, and noth-ing failed in its fulfillment as far as he was concerned. He lived until he plantedthe Gospel, until he received the apostle-ship, and every branch of the priesthood of Aaron and Melchizedek, all the keys of the kingdom of God, everything thatwas necessary in order to lay the founda-tion of this Church and Kingdom, which God, through the mouths of holy prophets,declared should be established in the lat-ter days, to be thrown down no more for ever.Under these circumstances, of course, faith is required on the part of the Saints to live their religion, do their duty, walk uprightly before the Lord and build up his Zion on the earth. Then it requiresworks to correspond with our faith. I know the testimony of Jesus Christ is not palatable; it does not, and never did, suit the ears of the world at large. Chris-tendom to-day does not like "Mormon-ism," because it comes in contact with the traditions handed down from the fathers; the world never did like the truth. We can not help that, it is our duty to bear a true and faithful testimony to the work of God, and to preach the Gospel whichhas been revealed to us in our day by the ministration of angels out of heaven. That Gospel is the same as was taught by Adam, and the ancient patriarchs, Abra-ham, Isaac and Jacob, Noah, Enoch, Me-thuselah and all the ancient prophets, alsoby Jesus and the Apostles. There never was but one Gospel, and never will be butone delivered to the children of men, and that never changed and never will changein time or eternity. It is the same in every age of the world; its ordinances are the same. Believers in the Gospel of had faith in Jesus before he came in the flesh, and re-pentance of sin was preached before his day as well as since; they also practiced baptism for the remission of sins and the laying on of hands for the gift of the HolyGhost; and they had the organization of the Church with inspired men therein. Saith the Lord Jesus,-- "I have set in thechurch, first, apostles, second prophets, third teachers, pastors, gifts, helps, and gov-ernments." What for? For the work ofthe ministry, for the perfecting of the Saints, &c. These things are necessary in every age of the world, and they have been restored in these last days, and they are true and will have their effect upon the children of men. When this Gospel is preached to the Gentiles and they countthemselves unworthy of eternal life it willgo to the house of Israel, and the firstwill then be last, as the last has been first.It is our duty as a people to unite to-gether and not to be slothful in welldoing. As I have already said, we should let our prayers ascend before the Lord. I have more faith in prayer before the Lord than almost any other principle on earth. If we have no faith in prayer to God, we have not much in either him or the Gospel. We should pray unto the Lord, asking him for what we want. Let the prayers of this people ascend before the Lord con-tinually in the season thereof, and theLord will, not turn them away, but they will be heard and answered, and the king-dom and Zion of God will rise and shine, she will put on her beautiful garments and be clothed with the glory of her God, and fulfill the object of her organization here upon the earth. Therefore, I say, breth-ren and sisters, let us do our duty. Letus pray for the Presidency of this Church; let us uphold and sustain them by our faith and by our works. They are calledof God, they have been our leaders for years. President Young has led this Church longer a great deal than any other man. His works and his life have been before you, and you know him, and the course he has pursued. God has blessed him and he has been profitable unto us. The revelations of God and the principles which he has brought forth have been a consolation to Israel. Our prayers should ascend for him that he may be restored to health and be preserved by the hand of God. We should pray to the Lord for everything else that we stand in need of.Then we should go to and do our duty in building the Temples of our God, that we may magnify our calling, and be saviors on Mount Zion, for the living and the dead. In the seventeen hundred yearswhich are past and gone, over fifty thou-sand million people have gone into the spirit world who never saw the face of a prophet or of an apostle, and never heard the words of an inspired man, for during the whole of that time no man was called of God to build up his kingdom on the earth. Whatever the Christian world may think, these things are true. When the apostles were put to death the priesthood went from the earth, and the church wentinto the wilderness, or, in other words, there was a falling away among the Gen-tiles, as there had been before among the Jews. Those generations are in the spirit world, shut up in prison; they have got to be visited by men who held the priest-hood in the flesh, that they may preach the gospel unto them, the same as Jesus did when he went to preach to the spirits in prison during the three days and nights when his body lay in the tomb. This isour duty. And I will here say that every elder of Israel who lays down his life,whether he dies in his bed, or is put todeath by the enemies of truth, when he goes into the spirit world his works follow him, and he rests in peace. The priest-hood is not taken from him, and he has thousands more to preach to there than he ever had here in the flesh. But it de-pends upon the living here to erect tem-ples, that the ordinances for the dead may be attended to, for by and by you will meet your progenitors in the spirit world who never heard the sound of the gospel.You who are here in Zion have power to be baptized for and to redeem your dead.The resurrection and the coming of the Messiah are at the door. The signs of heaven and earth indicate the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. The fig trees are putting forth their leaves in the eyes of every man who has the faith of the gospel. Let us, therefore, try and do our duty. Let us attend to the ordinances of thehouse of God, and unite ourselves accord-ing to his law, for Jesus will never receivethe Zion of God unless its people are united according to celestial law, for all who go into the presence of God have to go there by this law. Enoch had to prac-tise this law, and we shall have to do the same if we are ever accepted of God as he was. It has been promised that the New Jerusalem will be built up in our day and generation, and it will have to be done by the United Order of Zion and ac-cording to celestial law. And not only so, but we have to keep that law ourselves if we ever inherit that kingdom, for no man will receive a celestial glory unless he abides a celestial law; no man will receive a terrestrial glory unless he abides a ter-restrial law, and no man will receive a te-lestial glory unless he abides a telestial law. There is a great difference between the light of the sun at noonday and theglimmer of the stars at night, but that difference is no greater than the differenceof the glory in the several portions of thekingdom of God.I always have said and believed, and Ibelieve to-day, that it will pay you and me and all the sons and all the daughters of Adam to abide the celestial law, for celes-tial glory is worth all we possess; if it calls for every dollar we own and our lives into the bargain, if we obtain an entrance into the celestial kingdom of God it will amply repay us. The Latter-day Saints have started out for celestial glory, and if we can only manage to be faithful enough to obtain an inheritance in the kingdom, where God and Christ dwell, we shall re-joice through the endless ages of eternity.I thank God that my ears have heard the sound of the gospel. I thank God that I have been preserved upon the earth to live to see the face of an elder of Is-rael, to be called of God and to adminis-ter the ordinances of his house. I trav-elled a good many miles with PresidentJoseph Smith, as some of you did; I have also travelled a good many miles withPresident Young and with the Apostles and elders of Israel, and I have never seen the hour yet, in the midst of our deepestafflictions and persecutions, that I wassorry that I had embraced the gospel, and I hope I never shall.I pray God my heavenly Father that he will inspire our hearts as Latter-day Saints, that we may become one and, not having the fear of man before our eyes, but the fear of God, that we may be ready to do whatever is required of us, and to carry out the counsels of the servants of God. When we do this we shall be happy, and we shall be saved whether in life or in death. I pray that we may pursue this course, and that we may overcome the world, the flesh and the devil, and inherit eternal life, for Jesus sake. Amen. 
 in peace and in safety. Read the scriptures and the revelations.  They will tell you about all these things. Great changes are at our doors. The next twenty yearswill see mighty changes among the nations of the earth. Youwill live to see these things,whether I do or not. I have feltoppressed with the weight ofthese matters, and I felt I must speak of them here. It's by the power of the Gospel that we shallescape. We are having many men come to us with pretended revelations—Josephites and Strangites and other men; one man came to me and said he hadrevelations to lead this Church; I am willing to leave all thesethings in the hands of God.  Where has the power of God beensince the death of Joseph? With this people. They say, these apostates, that Brigham Youngorganized the endowments and originated the principle of plural marriage. They're liars, every one of them, and the truth is notin them; in so far as this matteris concerned. There's Sister Bathsheba Smith, she and I both had our endowments under the hands of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I had my second anoint-ings and sealings under his hands. There is not a single principle in this Church that he did notlay the foundation for; he called the Twelve together the last time he spoke to us, and his face shone like amber. And upon our shoulders he rolled the burden ofthe Kingdom, and he gave us all the keys and powers and gifts tocarry on this great and mighty work. He told us that he had received every key, every power and every gift for the salvation of the living and the dead, and he said: "Upon the Twelve I seal these gifts and powers andkeys from henceforth and forever. No matter what may come to me.  And I lay this work upon your shoulders. Take it and bear it off, and if you don't, you'll be damned."  I don't feel justified in contending with these apostates and such men. There is too much work to be done. And thesethings are true, and if such men don't find it out here, they will hereafter. There is an anxiety in the spirit world concerning this people. The angels of God are with us, and they will assistus in this work. God bless you and all this people.  I felt that I had finished my work when that Temple was finished; and the doctors said I could not live. But my life was spared because this people were putting up peti-tions in my behalf continually before God. I feel to bless you my brethren and sisters. MayHe help us all to do our duty, and be prepared for the great events coming upon this earth. Amen."

 these valleys every year, people who have been brought to a knowledge of the truth by the labors of the Elders that are now beforeme. Our brethren have preached the words of life to millions of people, and many thou-sands have given heed to their warning voicestill they are but few compared with the vast multitudes who have been commanded to re-pent of all their sins, be baptized for the re-mission of them, and have hands laid uponthem for the gift of the Holy Ghost. We are truly blest in the agency which God has given us to receive or reject whatever is presented to us, but we should remember that we shall be held responsible for the use we make of the teachings of the servants of God.It does not make any difference how the Lord makes known his will, whether by the whisperings of the Holy Spirit, the adminis-tration of angels, or by his own voice; it isall the same; and he has told us emphatically that his words shall not pass away, but allshall be fulfilled which has been spoken of bythe Prophets since the world began.We have but a little time to labour and toexert ourselves in this kingdom. Thirty yearshave already passed away since the organiza-tion of this Church, and we see a numerous generation rising up before us that have been born in this Church of Jesus Christ of LatterDay Saints; it is almost a generation, accord-ing to the usual reckoning of mankind since John the Baptist came and conferred the Aaronic Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery; and the kingdom has keptgrowing from that time to the present, perhaps not as fast as it might have done, if all the El-ders had been as faithful as our Presidenthas been; but still it is progressing rapidly, and it is where the Prophet had his eye uponwhen he said: "O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, liftup thy voice with strength; lift it up, be notafraid; say unto the cities of Judah Behold your God!" [Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] [##Isaiah 40:9##] How much the Elders have talked of this and of the little stone cut outof the mountain without hands, that was to roll forth until it filled the whole earth. [##Daniel 2:44-45##] Weare now fulfilling those predictions; we areplanted here in the mountains in fulfilment of the promise of the Almighty.In the early days of this Church the Lord told those who were first called to the minis-try that they were laying the foundation of agreat work, but they knew it not--they did not then understand the nature of the work to which they were called; still they felt by the inspiration of the Almighty, and their minds were opened to see that they were called to take part in a great work, called to a high and holy calling, but still there was a vail over their eyes so that they could not com-prehend it in i[ts] magnitude and greatness aswe now do. If the Prophet Joseph had arisen up in 1831, 2, 3, or even 1834, when we went up to Jackson county, in the State of Mis-souri—had he then told the people that this church would be built up and that this peo-ple would become a great kingdom, and thatthe United States would, in less than one gen-eration, be in the lamentable position that wenow find them, it would have required astretch of our faith to have believed him;our minds were not then open to that extentthat we could fully comprehend the future. But we can now see that the words of the ancientand modern Prophets are being fulfilled: this kingdom is rising in these valleys of the mountains, and it will eventually spread itselfabroad through the length and breadth of North and South America. We may now look forward into the great future that liesbefore us, and it will require just as much of a stretch of faith now as it did in the begin-ning; to look at the kingdom of God upon the earth, as it is to be built up in this dispensa-tion, so that the word of the Lord may go forth from Zion, the servants of God be clothed with the power of the priesthood to give counsel and to preside over the nations of the earth, when the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdom of our God and ofhis Christ. It is our duty to live in that way that we can have power to unlock and com-prehend the mysteries of the kingdom of God,and we have got this to do in order that we may see that the Lord is at work among the nations for his own glory and for the perma-nent establishment of his own kingdom.We ought to be enabled to understand that there is not a single law that has ever been issued from the great Eloheim but what will be fulfilled to the letter, and that not one of those Prophets who have spoken concerning the kingdom of God in the latter days, and the overthrow of wickedness and establish-ment of righteousness, will fail in their pre-dictions in reference to the dispensation of the fulness of times. When we look back for thirty years, we can see the vast change that has taken place.With regard to Babylon and the wicked nations of the Gentiles, I will say that all those things that have been spoken concern-ing them will be fulfilled. We profess to bethe children of God, the friends of God, and if the Lord has not got some friends in these the valleys of the mountains, I would like to know where his friends are. I have spoken upon these things, and in reference to the position we occupy before the heavens and before this generation, that we may be stirred up in our minds and be awake to ourduties. If we can be made sensible of thatwhich is required of us by our leaders, we shall go to work and do those things that we know will be for our benefit and good, and forthe advancement of the cause of the kingdom of God upon the earth. If we are faithful through this warfare in which we are engagedwe shall be satisfied with the reward and with the crown that will be bestowed upon us, and also with the place that we shall occupy when we pass from this stage of existence.I will say then, brethren and sisters, with regard to those things we have been exhorted to attend to by President Young from day to day and from time to time, let us attend to them. He has a desire to see the people in such a position that will secure to them the favorand approbation of the Almighty. We ought to strive to understand our high destiny, to learn the mind and will of our Father in heav-en, that the heavens may be opened unto us, that we may be filled with light, with truth, and be clothed with the power of God. It is with this desire and design that our Presidentcalls upon us to lay aside every thing that has a tendency to prevent us enjoying the spirit of the Lord, and us comprehending those great and glorious principles that we are seeking after. We all ought to make an ex-ertion, when he makes a request upon us, and strive to lay aside all those things that are contrary to the principles of our holy religion,and then we ought to take hold with him and back him up, and sustain with him all the authorities of the church, striving at all times to do whatever the Lord requires at our hands.If we do this, we shall be blest; and if we do not, we shall meet with a loss. Let us strive to be more attentive to our duties and to listen to the words of the Lord, remembering that if we have not got the spirit of the Lord with us, that we have not got the power of God with us.Let us lay aside all evil practices, all those habits which will prevent our communing with God. We have not yet got power to oc-cupy a throne and to govern according to the laws of heaven; of this we are all sensible,then if these little things have a tendency to hinder our enjoyments and debase us in the eyes of the Lord, we ought to lay them asideand manifest a d[e]termination to do the will ofour Father in heaven, and to accomplish that work which is laid upon us to perform. Whenwe have any exhortation from those who lead us, we should ever be ready to carry it out, remembering that the Lord holds President Young responsible for the way in which he manages and directs this kingdom; and, if we obey him, we shall be blest and prospered;but if he gives us commandments and we do not listen to them, the Lord will not hold him responsible for our acts. I think upon these things when I hear our leader giving us com-mandments to do thus and so, and I feel thatI shall loose the Spirit of the Lord, if I do not comply. We have got to rise up, as a people, and have the power of God constantly with us, or we shall not accomplish that which is required at our hands, for it requires faith,temperance, purity, holiness and the power of God to be with this people, in order to fulfil our mission and perform the work of God. When our Prophets and leaders command us to do a thing, let us obey, and then we shall gain the victory.I have often heard it remarked that when we have had preaching against merchandizing, that the next day the merchants have taken three dollars to where they had previously only taken one. I hope this will not be the case with those who make a practice of drink-ing whisky, and have been counseled by Presi-dent Young to let it alone.Brethren and sisters, I do not feel that I want to occupy much more of your time, butbefore I conclude, I will say that when I do anything that prevents me from enjoying the spirit of the Lord, as soon as I ascertain that,I immediately throw it aside, so that the spirit of God may govern and control me in every actof my life. We came here to build up the kingdom of God, and we should feel the re-sponsibility that is upon us. This is our home; and who of us appreciates the bless-ings bestowed upon us? We should appreci-ate them a great deal more than we do, if we were set down in New York or South Carolina for a while, we should appreciate our peaca-ble home; for here we are not troubled with any of the difficulties which they experience in the States. We can meet together andworship God in peace. It is truly a great blessing to be assembled in these chambers of the mountains.Let us try to prove ourselves worthy of our high calling as Saints of God. I pray that the Lord will give us power to lay aside every thing that is wrong; to magnify our callingsand build up the Kingdom of God. I feel to ask this blessing in the name of Jesus Christ:Amen.

 the Lord, and he is not trifling with us or with this generation.If the eyes of the Gentiles were opened one moment to see the things of eternity, and the judgments which await this gen-eration they would not wonder that the servants of God are moved upon to cry aloud to the nations of the earth. I tellyou that the judgments of God are at the door of both Zion and great Babylon. Great Babylon has come in remembrance before God, and His sword is bathed in heaven and it will fall on Idumea and theworld. Who can stand before the hand of Almighty God? No man, no nation, or set of nations on the face of the earth.I would to God that the eyes of the world were opened! I would to God that the eyes of the Gentile nations were open-ed, that they could see and understand what belongs to their peace! How much has the Lord plead with the nations of the earth to give them celestial glory, honor, immortality and eternal life? He has plead with them for the last six thousand years, and has raised up his servants from time to time and called upon the inhabi-tants of the world to prepare themselves for the great day of his second advent and coming, which is at hand. He is call-ing upon them loudly to-day; and, as I have said to some of my brethren lately,the Lord now wants to know whether the Latter-day Saints are willing to work with him or not. It is a day of decision. I do not expect that more than half of us will have oil in our lamps and be prepared to en-ter into the mariage supper with the Bride-groom. That will be about as much as we can expect, unless we repent of our sins and turn from our follies, fooleries and the fashions of Babylon—things which our hearts have been set upon instead of upon building up the kingdom of God. It seems to me that there will be but a remnant even of the Latter-day Saints who will be prepared to inherit eternal life and for the coming of the Bridegroom.I feel, in my bones and in my spirit, that there is a change at the door, both with Zion and Babylon. Great events await us and this generation. As I said before, judgments are at the door. The angels of God are waiting for the great command to go forth and reap down the earth. All earth and hell are stirred up against Zion. The spirit of lying is abroad in all the world, and the people will not receive the truth. In my meditations, whether in re-gard to the past or present, it has always seemed one of the greatest mysteries why so few have been willing to believe the revelations of God. In the days of Jesus, among all the Jewish rabbis, with their urim and thummim, ephod, sacrifices, giv-ing the law, and all the blessings of Judah which they held in their hands, it has been a marvel to me that so few had an interest in their Shiloh, their Saviour, who came to die to redeem the world. The whole spirit of Jerusalem and Judea was—"Crucify him, crucify him, let his blood be upon us and our children." [##Matthew 27:21-25##] It was and has been, and they have felt it. And the Gentiles have cause to take heed lest they too, fallthrough unbelief.I would tell Jew and Gentile, and all the earth if I had power, that God never hadbut one gospel to deliver to the sons of men, and that gospel is the same to-day, yester-day and forever, it never changes.  The Lord never had a Church in any age of the world that he acknowledged, but what it had a head to it, and it was organized with prophets, apostles, pastors, teachers, gifts, helps, governments, inspiration and gifts of the Holy Ghost; and God's church to-day is the same as in every other age.This Gospel is offered to the world, and that men generally have such a desire to root it out of the earth is the strongest proof imaginable that they are under the dominion and control of the father of lies. If any man has a truth that we have not got, we say "Let us have it." I am willing to exchange all the errors and false notions I have for one truth, and should consider that I had made a good bargain. We are not afraid of light and truth. Our religion embraces every truth in heaven, earth or hell; it embraces all truth, the whole gos-pel and plan of salvation, and the ful[fi]lment of the whole vo[l]ume of revelation that God has ever given. We have not power, men have not language, to show forth the eter-nal truths of God in all their fulness and beauty; all we can do is to warn the child-ren of men, and the Lord has chosen the elders of Israel for that very purpose. That has been one fault that men have found with the work of the Lord. A man asked me awhile ago—"Why did the Lord choose Joseph Smith to build up this kingdom? Why did he not choose Dr. Porter, Henry Ward Beecher, or some such men?" Said I—"Such men would sell the kingdom of God and everything in it for money and popularity, and as the Lord lives he never could rule and handle them, none of them would work with him, they are too much like the Pharisees, Sadducees, high priestsand Rabbis of Judea and Jerusalem." Did the Lord ever choose such men to perform his work? Go through the whole history ofthe world and you will find that whenever God wanted a servant, an apostle or a pro-phet he chose the very humblest man that could be found. When a king was wanted for Israel he could to find one out of all the tall sons of Jesse; and when the prophet asked if Jesse had not another son, he was told no, only the boy that looked after the sheep. Nobody thought anything about him, he was of no consequence. "Let me see him" said the man of God; and when he was brought the prophet poured oil on his head and anointed him King of Israel. So it has been all the way through. Take Moses, the leader of Israel. His mother cast him in the bulrushes on the banks of the river Nile to the crocodiles. But how carefully the Lord watched over him! Fin-ally the daughter of Pharaoh got him out, while bathing and gave him to his mother to be trained and nursed. [##Exodus 2:1-10##] You could see the hand of the Lord in this. When the Lord called Moses to deliver Israel from Egypt, said he—"How can I do this? I am a man of a hard language and slow of speech." [##Exodus 4:10##] He thought he could not get along for he had not a good command of lan-guage. But the Lord told him that he would find a spokesman for him. [##Exodus 4:14-16##] So all the way through the Lord has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the wise, and the things that are nought to bring to nought the things that are. Jesus Christ himself was born in a stable and cradled in a manger; and who were his apostle[s]? [##Luke 2:7##] [##Matthew 4:18-22##] Illiterate fishermen, men of the lowest calling almost in Judea, Salt Lake City, or anywhere else; but fishermen can be just as honorable men as any others, and they are generally regarded as very hum-ble men, and that is the kind of men God has always chosen.The Lord called Joseph Smith because he was foreordained before the world was to build up this church and kingdom, and he came through the loins of ancient Joseph. [##2 Nephi 3:6-22##] He was an illiterate youth, but the Lord used him, and he lived to fulfill the measure of his appointment; he lived as long as the Lord required him to live, and until he received every key held by every prophet and apostle that ever lived in the flesh from the days of Adam down to his day, which belonged to this dispensation.Joseph Smith received his first ordina-tion under the hand of John the Baptist, who was beheaded, and who, while in the flesh, held the Aaronic priesthood. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] Peter, James and John, who were prophets, and were crucified and put to death, at least Peter and James were, they came and or-dained Joseph Smith to the apostleship: and every ordination that he obtained, he ob-tained from the spirit world from men who had tabernacled here in the flesh. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] These are the eternal truths of the God of heaven, and eternity will reveal them to the inhab-itants of the earth. It is by this power that this church has been planted, not of man nor by the will of man, but by the revela-tions of Jesus Christ. We call upon the Latter-day Saints, we look to them, and the Lord looks to them, the heavens look to them, to take hold and build up this king-dom.Some of the outside world are finding a good deal of fault with the Indians. Who are the Indians? Read the Book of Mormon and you will learn that they are the literal descendants of Israel; they have been cursed through the transgressions of their fathers, and a skin of darkness has come upon them. This history tells us that they were once a white and delightsome people and had great power on this land, but that they were d[e]graded and cast down because of their sins. When we came here, we found them living upon crickets, grasshoppers, roots and anything they could possibly eat, poor miserable, degraded beings, though they have immortal souls and are of the house of Israel. What is the Lord doing for them? He is stretching forth his hand over them in remembrance of the promises made to their fathers. President Young and his people are accused of stirring up the Indi-ans against the general government and against the white man. This is not true. We have preached to the Indians a good many years as we have had opportunities, but what effect did it have? Not much. We preached to Walker, Arapene and many other chiefs who have dwelt here, but have now passed away; but our preaching had but little effect. Now the Lord is stretch-ing out his hand over the Lamanites, and their eyes are being opened and they are receiving the gospel of Jesus Christ at the hands of the Elders of Israel. Whose work is this? Not the work of man, but it is the work of God, and if the nations of the earth try to stay it the warfare is between them and God, and not between them and us. So with every other princi-ple which God has revealed to us. This work is the work of the God of Israel, and not the work of man; not the work of Brig-ham Young, the twelve apostles or any-body else. The hand of the Lord is feeling after that people, and if we as Latter-day Saints do not arise and magnify our call-ings and fulfill our missions the Lord will take that people and build up his kingdom, and we will be cast out. It is time that we awoke and realized this truth, and that, as elders of Israel, we realized our position before the Lord. Now there is a very gen-eral desire manifested by this people to get rich, and to labor for self rather than for the kingdom of God. But what will it pro-fit you or me to give up praying and to go to and get rich? What will it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Not much. What will a man give in exchange for his soul when he gets the other side of the vail? I marvel very muchat the little interest manifested by the in-habitants of the earth generally in their future state. There is not a person here today but what is going to live on the other side of the vail as long as his Creator—to the endless ages of eternity, and the eternal destiny of every individual depends upon the manner in which the few short years of the life in the flesh are spent. I ask in the name of the Lord, what is popularity to you or me? What is gold or silver, or this world's goods to any of us, any further than to enable us to obtain what we need to eat, drink and wear, and to build up the king-dom of God. And for us to stop praying and to become crazy after the riches of the world, is the very height of foolishness and folly. To see the way that some people act, you might suppose that they are going to live here eternally, and that their eternal destiny depends upon the number of dollars they have. I sometimes ask the Latter-day Saints how much we had when we came here? How much did we bring, and where did it come from? I do not think any one of us brought a wife or a brick house: I do not think that any of us were born on horseback or in a carriage, or that we brought railroad scrip and cattle and houses with us, but we were born naked as Job, and I think that we shall leave here as naked he did. Then with regard to this world's goods what do they amount to with us, that they should induce us to lose salva-tion for them? I say, rather than that let me be poor all the days of my life; if riches are going to damn me and take from me the glory I have in prospect through keep-ing the commandments of God I pray God that I may never possess them.God holds the riches of this world in his hands; the gold and silver, the cattle and the earth are his, and he gives to whom he will give. When Christ was upon the mount, Lucifer, the devil, showed him all the glory of the world and offered to give it to him if he would fall down and worship him. But do you know that that poor devil did not own a single foot of land in the whole world, and that he had not even a body, or tabernacle? The earth is the foot-stool of the Lord, and if we ever have any of it for our own the Lord will give it to us; and we ought to be just as faithful to our religion if we had ten thousand million dol-lars as if we had not any at all. Eternal life is what we are or ought to be after, and that, whatever our circumstances and condition in life may be, should be our first object.I say to the brethren and sisters—you have your appointment: the Lord has raised up these Elders of Israel, and I can prove from the Book of Doctrine and Covenants that you received the priesthood from eter-nity, and your lives have been hid with Christ in God, and you knew it not. You are literally and lawfully heirs of the priesthood through the lineage of your fathers, and that priesthood will continue throughout eternity, therefore you have received your appointment, and the Lord looks to you to build up his Zion and King-dom upon the earth.Let us try to be faithful and to live our religion; let us try to believe in the revela-tions of God. I think it will be better for our daughters, for our wives, for our sons and for ourselves to lay aside the New York Ledger and yellow covered literature gen-erally, and take hold and read the revela-tions of God, and comprehend them. When I read the revelations, whether in the Bible, Book of Mormon or Book of Doctrine and Covenants, I look upon them as true, and I look for their fulfilment. Up to the present day, one jot or tittle of them has never gone unfulfilled, and, as the Lord has said—"What I have spoken I have spoken, and I excuse not myself, and though the heavens and the earth pass away, not one jot or tittle of my word shall go unfulfilled, whe-ther by my own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same. Behold and lo I am God, and truth will be and abide for ever and ever, Amen." [##Doctrine and Covenants 1:38-39##] Now let us try and live our religion and keep the command-ments of God. As Latter-day Saints let us see where we are, and if we have no oil in our lamps let us stop trying to get rich, and let us pray to the Lord until we get his Spirit and oil in our lamps, and light unto the glory of God, and take hold and labor to build up his kingdom and Zion.Before I close I want to speak on one temporal point. I have been talking about getting riches. I do not find fault with riches. The gold and silver are the Lord's. We want houses building and we must cul-tivate the earth. This is all right. I do not find fault with a man getting rich, I find fault with our selling the kingdom of God, our birthright, selling the gospel and depriving ourselves of eternal life, for the sake of gratifying the lusts of the flesh, the pride of life and the fashions of the world; and setting our hearts upon these things. It is right to build houses, to plant vine-yards and orchards, to cultivate the earth and to make the desert blossom as the rose,to adorn our dwelling places and to build Temples. This is all right. I have no ob-jection to the ladies—our wives, daughtersand mothers—in Zion adorning themselves as much as they please, if they only makewhat they wear. Set out your mulberry trees and make your own silk; get strawand make your own bonnets; make your artificial flowers to adorn yourselves with,and let all be the workmanship of yourown hands, and do not import these things at the expense of the means we have inthe Territory. I have not any fault tofind with your adorning yourselves, if youonly make that which you require your-selves.I want to say one word to our farmersbefore I close. I want to ask you if youever heard brother Kimball tell about lay-ing up wheat? "Yes," say some, "we have heard him, but the famine has not comeyet." No, but it will come. The Lord is not going to disappoint either Babylon orZion, with regard to famine, pestilence, earthquakes or storms, he is not going to disappoint anybody with regard to any ofthese things, they are at the doors, and I want to give a word of exhortation to our farmers, and I say to them, lay up your wheat, for according to the spirit that has been in my bosom the last three or fourmonths, and in the breasts of a good many others, the day will come when, if you donot take this counsel, you will want your wheat for bread. I feel to exhort the brethren, and to say to them—lay up bread,do not sell it for a song; let your wives anddaughters go for awhile without ribbons and ornaments, let your wheat stay in yourbins; let us try to get along with old coats andold hats, and keep the wheat, and in a little while you will see the reason why this coun-sel has been given. Lay up your wheat and other provisions against a day of need,for the day will come when they will be wanted, and no mistake about it. We shallwant bread, and the Gentiles will want bread, and if we are wise we shall havesomething to feed them and ourselves when famine comes. We have fed thou-sands of them in days past, who would have laid their bones on these plains if ithad not been for the counsel of President Young to us to cultivate the earth and have wheat on hand to feed them. Andthe day will come again when corn will bewanted in Zion, and it will be sought for.I hope the Latter-day Saints will take heed to these things and be wise.I pray that God will bless you, that he will give you his spirit, that you may seeand understand your position before him. And I pray that he will open the eyes, ears and hearts of the Gentiles, that they mayreceive the Gospel of Christ, and be num-bered with the house of Israel in the last dispensation of the fullness of times, that they may stand in holy places while the judgments of God pass through the nations,for they will come to both Jew and Gentile, Zion and Babylon. There is no getting away from them, for the Lord has said so, and what he has said will come to pass.Amen.

 SERMON,by WILFORD WOODRUFF, Tabernacle Feb. 25, 1855-[Reported by G.D. WATT ]-I will endeavor to occupy a little time this morning, and while I address my friends, I hope I may have their attention and prayers; for I realize that while any person stands before an assembly of this kind to teach, he needs the Spirit of the Lord to dictate and direct his mind, that he may speak unto the edification of the people.I am aware that Mormonism, as it is called, presents a wide field for reflection and contem-plation; it presents an extensive surface upon which the mind may roam; it affords a variety of objects for us to converse upon; but, at thesame time, we want our minds led in that chan-nel which is according to the mind and will of the Lord.We have had some very interesting teaching presented to us from this stand, during the last two Sabbaths especially, though I may say that we have good teaching every Sabbath that we assemble together in this house. In fact, the day and age in which we live— those things connected with the past and present history of this people, and the signs of the times, are matters so diverse from the affairs of the nations of the earth, and from the views of the children of men generally, that they cause them to marvel and wonder exceedingly.I felt to rejoice last Sabbath while sitting in this stand, listening to our President. I will tell you why I felt to rejoice—there was one main reason for my joy; I have been acquainted longenough with this work to know its truth; I have had sufficient experience in it to see, and to know that the hand of God is in it, and that it is con-trolled and guided by the Spirit of the Almighty, and the revelations of heaven, to know, that from the commencement of it, it has been the design ofthe God of heaven to establish his kingdom upon the earth to be thrown down no more for ever.I rejoice that this kingdom is blessed with a leader, or leaders, who are not ashamed or afraid to watch over the interests of Zion—at all times to seek diligently the welfare of the children ofIsrael; who will point out the path for this people to walk in, whether that path may be popular or unpopular; leaders who will not hesitate to rebuke sin and wickedness, whether emanating from high or low places.Those who have been acquainted with the Prophet Joseph, who laid the foundation of this church and kingdom, who was an instrument in the hand of God in bringing to light the Gospel in this last dispensation, know well that every feel-ing of his soul, every sentiment of his mind, and every act of his life, proved that he was deter-mined to maintain the principle of truth, even to the sacrificing of his life. His soul swelled wide as eternity for the welfare of the human family. He began entirely alone, as far as the influences of the children of men were concerned upon the earth, to endeavor to establish a religion and order of things diverse from anything then existing among men, a religion that was unpopular and contrary to the feelings, and views, and traditions of the whole human family.Every man that is acquainted with the history

 REMARKSBy Elder Wilford Woodruff, Tabernacle, Monday Evening,Oct. 6, 1856.REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.Brethren and Sisters: I feel to take the liberty of occupying a few moments in ex-pressing some few of my feelings. I have heard all the brethren that have spoken forseveral days past. I have heard them say thatit was with great difficulty that they expressedtheir feelings, and I did not wonder at this forany one who will reflect upon the state of the world and the kingdom of God upon the earthand the dealings of God with us will be filled feelings and reflections which they cannot ex-press. No man could listen to what we haveheard to-day and yesterday, and I may say for the past month, without having many feelingsin reference to the condition of the people, church and kingdom of God. There is no man that has been acquainted in this church and kingdom that has felt any responsibility rest-ing upon him that has any desire in relationto the gathering of Israel, that has beheld with his eyes for the last week or two, and that has listened to our brethren but must have felt that the Spirit of God has been with them.I have a desire to bear my testimony withmy brethren, for I feel thankful to God for his blessings unto us, and unto our brethren who have journeyed on foot to the valleys. My heart was filled with joy on listening to our re-turned missionaries who have told of the deal-ings of God with them. I have been much edified and interested in listening to the testi-mony of our returned missionaries. 
 final proof, on said land, willbe June 16, 1898.

 40 THE DESERET NEWS. [Sept. 28DISCOURSE,By Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF,delivered in the New Tabernacle, SaltLake City, May 6th, 1870.REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANSI believe this is the largest assembly ofSaints or sinners, Jew or Gentile, that ever I saw together under one roof. There are very few of us capable of making such an assembly hear, unless it is very still; and when persons have come from twenty to two hundred and fifty miles to attend Con-ference, it certainly is important that we give them a chance to hear what is said.It is true that God has set his hand in these latter days to bring to pass His act, His strange act, and to accomplish His work, His strange work,—that truth shouldspring out of the earth, and righteousnesslook down from Heaven; and it certainly would be strange if these things were not performed. The Supreme Ruler wouldnot be like a God who had created a world like this and peopled it if He let it go at random, without any purpose or plan for the benefit and salvation of the children ofmen.I want to say a few words on this subject. I consider that the work we now see taking place in these mountains, and which has been going on from the time this Church was organized, is but carrying out the great plan of our Father in heaven—that plan which was ordained from before the foundation of the world. In fact there is no dispensation that has been looked upon with as much interest by all the prophets of God and inspired men, from the day ofJoseph Smith, as that in which we live, in which the Zion of God is being built up, and the earth is being prepared for the coming of the Son of Man.Isaiah, in looking by prophetic vision to this day, makes use of very strong lan-guage in endeavoring to express his feel-ings in relation to it. In one instance he says, "Sing, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth! Break forth into singing, O ye mountains,for the Lord has comforted His people, and will have mercy on His afflicted yet." Zion says, "The Lord has forsaken me, my God has forgotten me." "Can a woman forgether sucking child, that she should not have[c]ompassion on th[e] sone of her womb?" "Yea," the Lord says, "a woman may do [t]hat," but He will not forget Zion. Says He "Zion is engraven on the palms of my hands, her walls are continually beforeme."Now this Zion of God has been before His face from before the foundation of the world, and it is no more going to fail in the latter days than any of the purposes of God are going to fail, hence I look upon thiswork as the work of God, and it makes nodifference to the Lord Almighty, nor to His Saints, what the world may think or do about it, or what course they may pur-sue with regard to it; they cannot stop its progress, because it is the work of God. Ifit were the work of man it would not exist as it does to-day. If God had no hand in this work, we should not have seen thisassembly here to-day in this Tabernacle,nor this Territory filled with cities and towns.  But being the work of God, Heasks no odds of any nation, kindred, tongue or people under the whole heavens, any further than they are willing to keep His commandments and do His will; for as the Lord God Almighty lives, so true will the work, the foundation of which has been laid in these latter days, increase and con-tinue until its consummation is effected, and the great Zion of God is established in beauty, power and glory, and the domin-ion of the kingdom of our God extends over the whole earth.Joseph Smith laid the foundation of this work, he was chosen by the Lord for that purpose, and was ordained by prophets,and inspired men who formerly held thekeys of the Kingdom of God upon the earth. They laid their hands upon hishead and ordained him to the priesthood,and gave him power to unlock the heavens and to administer the ordinances of the house of God upon the earth. This workhe performed in the face of difficulty, per-secution, opposition and oppression; but the hand of God sustained him. He knew what few men or people on the whole face of the earth know—that God lives, and he also knew that the work whose foundations he laid was the work of God.This is what has sustained President Young through all his labors. Many men have looked upon him, and, in consequence of outside pressure, have expected him to say this, that, and the other; but all the time he has taken a straightforward course, walkingin the path pointed out by the God of hea-ven; and that same hand has sustained him and you and me and every good and virtuous man and woman on the face of the earth who has listened to the command-ments of God.Isaiah and other prophets saw in vision much concerning the building up and establishment of the latter-day Zion of God upon the earth. They saw the people gathering from the nations of the earthto the mountains of Israel; they speak of a great company coming up to Zion, the women with child and her that travailed with child together; and a great many other things in relation to the internal workings of the inhabitants of Zion in building up the kingdom of God they do not mention, whether they ever saw them or not. Isaiah has not written concerning many of these things, neither has anybody yet that we know of. Perhaps when the remainder of the plates, which were delivered to the Prophet Joseph, and which he was com-manded not to translate. come forth, we may learn many more things pertaining toour labor on the earth which we do not know now. But be this as it may, all this internal work is left for the Holy Ghost toreveal to the living oracles, as they guide, lead, dictate and direct; the people day by day.  This is one thing I want to say to my friends and to the Saints of God, that with-out the Holy Ghost, without direct revela-tion and the inspiration of God continually, Brigham Young could not lead this people twenty-four hours; He could not lead them at all. Joseph could not have done it,neither could any man. This power is in the bosom of Almighty God, and Heimparts it to His servants the prophets as they stand in need of it day by day tobuild up Zion.I want to say to my brethren and sisters that President Young is our leader; he isour lawgiver in the Church and kingdom of God. He is called to this office; it is his prerogative to tell this people what to do, and it is our duty to obey the counsel that he has given to-day to the sisters and the brethren. We, as a people, should nottreat lightly this counsel, for I will tell you in the name of the Lord, and I havewatched it from the time I became a mem-ber of this Church, there is no man whoundertakes to run counter to the coun-sel of the legally authorized leaderof this people that ever prospers, and no such man ever will prosper. Many things I might name, if it were wisdom todo so, to prove the truth of this statement,but you may watch for yourselves, and you will find that all persons who take a stand against this counsel will never prosper.A great deal has been said with regard to guiding this people in temporal matters. I ask you in the name of the Lord, who is called to guide the temporal affairs of thisChurch and Kingdom, for its advantage, redemption and exaltation, as pure as a bride adorned for her husband, if it be not that man who is placed as the law-giver and leader of Israel? There is no man on the footstool of God who has this authoritybut him who stands at the head; and hiscounsellors and the apostles, bishops and elders ought to be co-workers with him, and they should work together in carrying out his counsel. And when counsel comes we should not treat it lightly, no matter to what subject it pertains, for if we do it will work evil unto us.   Co-operation, it is well known to every Saint who has his eyes and ears open, has brought much good to Israel, yet from the very com-mencement of it there has been more or less discontentment and dissatisfaction felt and manifested towards it; but there is not an individual who has attempted to work against it but what has lost the spirit of God unless he has repented. It is so in all things, as every one of us who has had ex-perience in this Kingdom has seen over and over again. No man has ever pros-pered by this course, but if he has contin-ued it he, by and by, has gone downward instead of upward; no such man ever re-ceived and gained to himself honor by tak-ing such a course, and no man ever will. They may try it as often as they wish; no matter whether they are insiders or out-siders, every man who undertakes to fightagainst this work and people, will, in God's own time, receive chastisement at His hand. Many who have done so have been cut off, and others will follow. This is true, whether it is in regard to following counsel or not. We cannot treat lightly the counsel of God without incurring His displeasure.Does any man or woman wonder thatPresident Young leads out, and calls upon us to follow, in directing tomporal affairs? What would become of us and Zion if there were no one to give counsel in temporalmatters? We could not advance if such were the case; but we have been guided so far by the servants of God and the spiritof God. We have been dull scholars per-haps in a great many things, but I thank God that it is as well as it is with us to-day. The organization of this Church took placeforty years ago with six members, and here is a congregation that would make two thousand branches of the Church as large as the first branch that was established; and this is only one congregation, while we have 600 miles of towns, villages and settle-ments in this Territory. It is progress all the time. Why? Because it is the work of God. No one can stand in the way of the work of God in safety. The Lord is not dependant upon any man on His footstool;if one man will not do his bidding another will. He gives his law to all men, and inasmuch as they reject it they ate under condemnation.I fear not the world.  We are the only people under heaven who are one, and weare not half as much one in we ought to be;we have to improve. We are the onlypeople in the whole Christian world whomake any pretensions to oneness in build-ing up the Zion of God on the earth. We profess to be one in the gospel, and we have to become so in temporal matters. We have to become of one heart and mind in giving attention and obedience to the counsel of God in all things, both spiritual and temporal.  Zion has got to advance; she has got to rise and shine and put onher beautiful garments. She is advancing and has been from the time of the organiz-ation of this Church, and she will continue to do so until the winding up scene.When I look at the blessing of the gospel of Christ, and at the blessings which we asa people enjoy; when I look at the glorious principles which God has revealed for the exaltation and glory of man, I rejoice in them, and ask who will obey them? I feel that we ought to be thankful to God day and night; we should be humble and al-ways ready to listen to counsel. Let us go to and carry out these principles. "If yelove me keep my commandments," says the Lord Jesus. President Young preached on that subject a few Sabbaths ago, showing that however great our professions as Saints may be, they are vain unless we keep the commandments and counsels of the Lord given unto us. What are they? We have the moral law and we have the gospel in the scriptures; but there are command-ments and ordinances, and there is counsel which we have to observe which are not contained in the Bible, in the Book of Mormon or in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. In fact there is very little there in regard to our work and labors here as a people.The Lord has put into our hands the power to build up this great Zion, which all the ancient prophets rejoiced in and pro-phecied about. What manner of people ought we to be who are called to carry outthis work? We ought to be the saints and children of God in very deed. Our hearts ought to be open and prepared to receive instruction, light and truth, and to carry out, all principles which may be communi-cated unto us by the servants of the Lord. The counsels we have had to-day are of great value to the Latter-day Saints. By and by Babylon will fall; in a little while "no man will buy her merchandise," and the sooner we are prepared for the changes which are about to take place in our nation and in the nations of the earth the better for us. We are all interested in the wel-fare of Zion. Our wives, daughters and sons are interested in the welfare of the husbands and fathers, and the children in that of the parents; and we all should be in-terested in each other's temporal and spirit-ual labors, and there should not be a selfish feeling on the part of any portion of a fam-ily—"I do not care what becomes of this, or that or the other, if I can only get what I want myself." This is selfishness, it pro-duces disunion and is inconsistent with the profession of a saint of God. We should labor, each and every one of us to put such feelings from our hearts, and then we, in our family organizations, should strive to promote the general interest of the mem-bers thereof; but the interest of Zion and the Kingdom of God should be first with us all the time, for we are all members in that kingdom and its welfare is ours.I consider that we are in a position in which we have every chance to do a greatdeal of good in our day and generation, we have every chance to work with the Lord, every chance to fulfil our missionand calling here on the earth. We haveevery chance to build up the Zion of God. I rejoice in the faith, that has been manifested by those who have charge of the affairs of the kingdom of God, in the revelations of God. By their works they have manifested theirdetermination continually to carry out thecommands of God. "Who am I" saith the Lord, "that I command and am not obey-ed?" "Who am I" saith the Lord, "that I promise and do not fulfil?" The Lord has never made a promise to the children of men but what he has fulfilled it; and all the promises that the Lord has made and all the revelations that have been given by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, will have their fulfilment, and we have noth-ing to fear. As President Young said afew Sabbaths ago, the only thing we needfear is that we shall not keep the com-mandments of the Lord. Let us keep the commandments of God and then we shall have power with Him; the word of theLord will sustain us and He will fight our battles. "Vengeance is mine, I will re-pay" saith the Lord. We need have nofears with regard to the future. The Zionof God is before His face continually. He has laid a foundation and He will build upon it, and His Saints will build upon it;and thousands and tens of thousands ofthe meek of the earth will yet take hold and become co-workers in the great work of God. I feel, myself, as though we should lay these counsels that we receive, to heart; we should not treat them lightly.  We have been called upon by the Lord and His servants to keep the Word of Wisdom; it is time we did it. Wherein we have fail-ed in these things in the past we should try to improve.I rejoice in this work, I rejoice in thegospel of Christ. I rejoice that we live in a day when we have inspiration, when we have prophets, apostles and inspired men to lead us, and when we are made partac-ers of the blessings of the kingdom of God upon the earth. It is safe for us to pursue that course wherein we can walk in thelight, and we need not find fault with the principles of the gospel because any bro-ther does that which we cannot endorse. It is for us, each of us, individually to see to our own conduct, and never follow the errors of others. It is not difficult to find them in our own conduct. We should allbring this home to ourselves.I do hope that the sisters, generally, and the Female Relief Societies in particular, will listen to the counsel that has been given to-day, and that they will go to and establish braiding schools in all their societies, where the young ladies may betaught to braid straw. President Young has called upon them to do it from time to time. It is true that he has not always commanded them, in the name of the Lord,to do thus and so, and this has been a great blessing to Israel.  We have been govern-ed by counsel instead of commandment in many things, which has been a blessing to the Saints, for "he that is commanded in all things and obeyeth it with slothfulness andnot a willing mind, is not qualified before the Lord as that man is who having the power within him, bringeth to pass much righteousness without being commanded in all that he does.I feel thankful for the blessings that we enjoy. The Prophet Joseph was called an idler and a gold digger. We have been called a great many things,—such as lazy,indolent, and many other things discredit-able. Why, every man possessing reason and judgment, who knows anything about the Territory of Utah, will at once pro-nounce such assertions nonsensical, for this city and every portion of the Territory bearwitness to the untiring labor and industry of the Latter day Saints, and the people, asa general thing outside, are beginning to give up the idea that we are an idle people.They formerly found a great deal of faultwith Joseph Smith, because they said he was a gold digger; but since then nearly all the christian world have turned gold dig-gers. Hundreds of thousands of them nave run into this western country to dig gold; and, while they formerly found fault withus for digging gold they have latterly found fault because we do not dig it. I hope and trust that all the accusations of wrong brought against us in the future will be as groundless as those of the past.  Let us show our faith by our works, let us show to the Lord our God that we have faith and confidence in his word and works.We have to become united as a peoplein all our labors,—in our agriculture, man-ufactures; and every branch of our tempor-al labors. It is of great importance to theLatter day Saints that they should unite together on the principle of co-operation.Where this is not done we still ought to try individually to manufacture all we can.I was pleased, a few days ago, while paying a visit to Jenning's shoe Factory, to see the large number of home made boots and shoes, many of which were made with ma-chinery which has been imported for the purpose. This should be done wherever it is possible; the people should co-operate and import labor-saving machinery so asto be able to compete with foreign manu-facturers of goods of all kinds. President Young has set an example in introducing carding machines and in establishing fac-tories here. He has done all he could in this direction, and we should follow in the wake as far as we can. I know that Godwill bless the people by doing this.I do not wish to occupy any more time. I feel to say God bless you.  Lay thesethings to heart. Let us lay hold and build up Zion. Let us realize that we are the children of God, that he is at work with us and that we are at work with Him. It has been said that the Lord and a good man are a great majority. He has got a greatmany good men on the earth, and he isgathering them to-gether to build up Zion, to carry out his work and to do his will.He will so control the course of human events so as to forward His purposes. He holds the destinies of the nations in His hands. He holds Zion in His hands andHe will carry out His work and do all Hehas promised. Those who fight against Zion fight against God, and He will break every weapon formed against His king-dom, and will bring His people triumphant over every obstacle, and finally give them eternal life, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God. May God grant that it may be bestowed upon us by our faith, works, and labors, through His mercy and good-ness, for Jesus sake. Amen. 
 242 THE DESERET NEWS. -[July 5 1866.REMARKS,By Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF, Tabernacle,G. S. L. City, October 22d, 1865.REPORTED BY E. L. SLOAN.There is a great responsibility resting upon any prophet, apostle, high priest, elder, or any messenger or servant of God, who is called to preach the Gospel; and any person who is called to preach the gospel to the children of men is en-tirely dependent upon the Spirit of the Lord for all the principles he may pre-sent unto those who hear him. Any generation, also, to whom a message is sent from heaven, is held responsible for the receiving or rejecting of that message.It is a very hard matter for the Lord to build up His kingdom upon the earth, where the devil has power and dominion over the minds of the chil-dren of men. It would [be] impossible for Him to do so in this or any other age of the world, unless he found an element to work with Him, for the very reason that He has given to all men an agency to choose the path in which they will walk. This is the reason why there has been so small a portion of time since the creation of the world in which God has had an organized kingdom up-on the earth—when He has had a church that He Himself has organized, guided, dictated, directed and controll-ed. The devil—lucifer—the son of the morning, has had great dominion here upon the earth; he has had great do-minion over the minds of the children of men; and the Lord has taken great pains, I may say from the creation, to endeavour to establish His kingdom, to present His laws upon this earth, and to get the children of men to obey those laws that they might fulfil the object of their creation.The Lord gave father Adam the priesthood, and the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, after the fall. When he went out into the dreary world, driven from the Garden of Eden, he received the gospel, he received the priesthood, and he started forth upon the face of the earth with the keys of the kingdom of God, to endeavour to establish the works of righteousness upon the earth. [##Moses 5:6-12##]He gave this priesthood to his sons. A number of them were ordained high priests. [##Moses 6:67-68##] But in the commencement we find not only the work of God but the work of the devil manifest in the hearts of men. Cain was stirred up in anger against his brother Abel, and rose up and slew him, shedding innocent blood, and the power of evil commenced in the beginning. [##Genesis 4:1-17##] We find from the Bible, as well as from other revelations which God has given us, that Adam and the early patriarchs, those who were willing to be led by the law of God in that gen-eration, received the high priesthood, and lived to a great age. It is said Me-thusela lived to be almost 1000 years old, and so did father Adam and others. [##Genesis 5:27##]They held the priesthood, and taught their children truth and righteousness to establish the kingdom of God in their day and generation. Herein is where I say the Lord commenced and laboured to establish his kingdom and to guide men to receive the word of the Lord, that they might walk in obedience to His laws, fulfil the object of their crea-tion and be saved when they got through with this probation, that they might keep their estate and receive an exaltation and glory in the presence of God.We are informed by revelation that Adam, three years previous to his death, "called Seth, Enos, Cainan, Ma-halaleel, Jared, Enoch and Methuselah,who were all high priests, with the re-sidue of his posterity, who were right-eous, into the valley of Adam-ondi-ahman" and there bestowed upon them his last patriarchal blessing; and he prophesied what should take place even till the coming of Messiah, which pro-phecy is said to be written in the Book of Enoch. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] But men soon began to work corruption and unrighteousness on theearth in that early age; and in tracing the history of the church and kingdom of God from those prophets down, we find that the majority of the human family were unwilling to keep the com-mandments of God or to live according to those principles which were revealed to them for their salvation. It was but a little time after, comparatively speak-ing, that Enoch, who was acquainted with the teachings of Adam and of his fathers who held the holy priesthood, laboured to gather the people together to practise righteousness, but the majority of them would not be guided by him. He laboured 365 years, we are informed by revelation, teaching them principles of righteousness, that they might be-come sanctified and prepared to receive celestial glory, but his labors were not appreciated by them. Why did not Enoch remain on the earth and Zion prevail? Because wickedness prevailed. The majority of the human family in that generation were wicked; they were not ruled over by the Lord; and, hence, there were not men enough on the face of the earth, in that generation, who were willing to receive the gospel, keep the commandments of God and work the works of righteousness, for Enoch to have power to remain on the earth. Therefore it was that the Lord took Enoch and the city of Enoch to him-self; for we are informed by revelation that the city was translated and all its inhabitants. There were not men enough in the days of Enoch who were willing to sustain that which was right; one part or other had to leave the earth; and the Lord translated Enoch and his city and took them home to Himself. [##Moses 6:26-8:2##]You may trace the history of the kingdom of God from that time down,and you will find this prevailing among the nations of the earth. They were prone to evil, to sin, to blaspheme, to lie, to steal, to swear, to commit adul-try, to pollute the earth which they in-herited, in their day and generation, and hence it was an impossibility for the Lord to establish His kingdom among the children of men, unless He could find willing minds enough to receive that kingdom, to build it up and sustain it and do the works of right-eousness. The devil did not make this earth. It never belonged to him, and never will; but lucifer was cast down to the earth with the third part of the hosts of heaven, and they have dwelt here until to-day. They remain here yet; and they have had their effect up-on the hearts and minds and lives of the children of men for nearly six thousand years—from the time that man was cast out of the Garden of Eden into the cold and dreary world.The Lord has set His hand many times in different dispensations to es-tablish His kingdom upon the earth;He has raised up men—noble spirits—who have come forth and tabernacled in the flesh at different periods and times. He has inspired those men; giv-en them revelations; filled them with inspiration, with light, with truth, with the things of the kingdom of God; and many of them had the vision of their minds opened to behold the fate of the work of God in all generations—the beginning, the middle and the end. Many old prophets have seen, by reve-lation, our day, have seen the sorrow, calamity, war and afflictions in various dispensations and ages of the world. The earth had become so corrupted un-der its inhabitants in the days of Noah, that the word of the Lord came to him to build an ark; he received revelation from God to prepare to save himself and his family, while the wicked were de-stroyed. [##Genesis 7-8##] Enoch before him had seen this event; he had seen the same things as Noah. The Lord had shown him what was in the future.  Whenever a generation have corrupted themselves and defiled the earth, and the cup of their iniquity is full, the Lord has brought judgments upon that genera-tion. This we have ample testimony of from the commencement of the world.Noah was 120 years building the ark, we are informed in the Scriptures, and during that time he preached the gospel. How many were there who were will-ing to believe his testimong? Only eight souls in all, including himself. He was very unpopular, I presume, and had as much derision heaped upon his head, for building an ark on dry ground, as any man that ever lived on the earth. But Noah was a prophet and a messenger of God, called to warn that generation and to build an ark, and if he had not done it he would have been held responsible for the lives of himself and family and all that generation. But he had the Spirit of God and was willing to do as he was told, whether the doc-trine he preached was popular or un-popular.  He built the ark, and went into it with his family, and they were saved. The history of the flood and of the salvation of Noah and his family is well known. He performed the work assigned him to do, and was saved; and that generation went to hell, there to remain until Christ went and preached the Gospel to their spirits in prison that they might be judged like men in the flesh. So you may trace the history of the kingdom of God through the world, generation after generation, and there is no generation that we have ever read of, the majority of whom have been willing to serve the Lord.Look at the days of Abraham, whose faith was so great that he was called the father of the faithful. He was an heir to the royal priesthood, another noble spirit, the friend of God. He came upon this earth, not in a way of light, but through idolatrous pa-rents. His father was an idolator. I do not know who his grandfather was; but his father had false gods that he worshipped and sacrificed to. God in-spired Abraham, and his eyes were opened so that he saw and understood something of the dealings of the Lord with the children of men. He under-stood that there was a God in heaven, a living and true God, and that no man should worship any other God but Him. These were the feelings of Abraham, and he taught his father's house, and all around him, as far as he had the privilege. The consequence was, his father and the idolatrous priests of that day sought to take his life. In the book of Abraham, translated in our day and generation, we are informed that Abraham was bound, and those priests sought to take his life, but the Lord de-livered him from them. One reason why they did so was, that he had gone into those places which his father con-sidered sacred, and among the wooden gods which were there, and, being filled with anger that his father should bow down and worship gods of wood and stone, he broke them. When his father saw that his son Abraham had broken his gods he was very angry with him. But Abraham, trying to reason with his father, said that probably the gods had got to fighting among themselves and had killed one another. He tried to bring him to reason, but his father did not believe they had life enough to kill one another. If he had possessed the spir-it which his son had, he would have said there is no power with these gods; but he did not, and Abraham had to flee from his father's house, confiding in the Lord who gave many promises to him and concerning hls posterity. [##Abraham 1:1-19##]We have no account of the Lord's having organized a kingdom upon the earth in that day; but he gave the priest-hood to Abraham, who taught his chil-dren the principles of righteousness. Isaac taught Jacob; and Jacob's sons, the twelve Patriarchs, were taught by the priesthood, and God gave unto them many great and glorious blessings. From that time until the days of Moses we can trace in sacred history that the Lord had witnesses on the earth, from time to time, who were raised up and bore record of the truth to the people. Moses was raised up and led Israel forty years, he was a high priest after the or-der of Melchizedek, and received his priesthood from Jethro, his father-in-law, who received it through Abraham. Moses undertook to preach the gospel to the Israelites; but they were very dark, very prone to evil, as well as the gentiles around them; and they had not that faith and the fulness of inspiration which the Lord desired, to build up His kingdom; consequently, they had a law of carnal commandments given to them to bring them to Christ. [##Exodus 20-23##] The Lord labored with them, and Moses labored with them; he could not leave them for a short time but they were ready to turn to idolatry and make a golden calf to worship, or something contrary to the kingdom of God. [##Exodus 32##]Trace this down to the days of Christ and you will find it has been a hard matter for the Lord to get people to have faith in Him to build up His kingdom. Jesus came in fulfilment of the prophe-cies; He was the Son of God, and a liter-al descendant of Abraham. He came to his own and his own received him not, though he was the Son of God. [##John 1:11##] Take the Jews to-day anywhere in the world, and they do not believe in Jesus. I do not say this because I wish to find fault with them. I have a great love for them as a people. But they have re-jected the Messiah, and they will re-main in unbelief until they go back and rebuild Jerusalem—which they will do in this generation—and until the Mes-siah comes. The day will comc when Judah will know who Shiloh is, and that day is not very far distant. Jesus came, organized his church and king-dom and sent the gospel to the Jews; but the Jews failed, through unbelief, and the gospel was given to the gentiles, to whom one of the ancient apostles said "If God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest He also spare not you."  [##Romans 11:21##] Did the kingdom of God re-main in the days of Christ, with apos-tles, pastors, teachers, and the gift of the Holy Spirit? But a little time elapsed until the Lord could not find men enough throughout the whole gentile world who would receive the kingdom of God in its purity, embrace its princi-ples and maintain it on the earth. Hence there was a falling away; the gifts and graces of the gospel were lost to men; those who held the priesthood were overpowered, and put to death by wicked men. The Church went into the wilderness, and all that the pro-phets had spoken concerning the king-dom of God in that day had its fulfil-ment.Christendom professes to believe the bible; and all we have asked of this gen-eration is to believe the bible, and then they will believe that God will establish His kingdom in the last days, for the bible plainly points it out, and shows that the Lord will send an angel bear-ing the everlasting gospel to them that dwell on the earth, that it may be preached to every nation, kindred, tongue and people.  All the prophets who have spoken of the last days have spoken of this work.  Daniel saw it and prophe-sied of it. [##Daniel 10-12##] Isaiah, Jeremiah, and all the prophets have referred to it. And the Lord sent His angel, in fulfilment of what He declared He would do, who called upon a man on the earth, a lit-eral descendant of Abraham and of Jo-seph—one of the promised seed who had been prophesied of in ages past and gone, that he would come forth and lay the foundation of the kingdom of God. The angels of God ministered unto him; his name was Joseph Smith; and he laid the foundation of this kingdom, or this congregation would not be before me to-day. You are the fruits of the labors he commenced.The Lord has said that in the last days His kingdom should not be taken from the earth, nor given to another people; but that the kingdoms of this world should become the kingdoms of our God and His Christ. We have the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and other revelations of God to this effect. Either this is the kingdom of God or it is not the kingdom of God. If it is not the kingdom of God, then are we like the rest of mankind; our faith is vain, our works are vain, and we are in the same condition of ignorance with regard to the gospel and the purposes of God, as the rest of the world. There are tens of thousands throughout these valleys, who know that this is the kingdom of God. They know this by the revela-tions of Jesus Christ. It is not the tes-timony of another man that gives me the knowledge for myself. If I had not the testimony of truth for myself I would not be qualified to build up this kingdom.  There is no man or woman qualified to build up the kingdom of God if they have not the testimony of truth for themselves.I will say to this congregation, Jew and gentile, believer and unbeliever, that this is the great kingdom spoken of by Daniel, the commencement of the Zion of our God, which every prophet has spoken of who has referred to theZion of the last days. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] The Lord has sworn by Himself, because He could swear by no greater, that He will estab-lish it in the latter days. But to do this He must get a people to work with Him. It could not be done otherwise if the world stood for a million years, for it is by the agency which men hold that He accomplishes His purposes on the earth.  The Lord prepared the way for this age and generation, and He has raised up some of the noblest spirits inthis dispensation that ever dwelt in the flesh. He ordained Joseph Smith from before the foundation of the world to come forth and lay the foundation ofHis kingdom. Those that knew Joseph know that he was true and faithful un-to death. He laboured, after he was or-dained with Oliver Cowdery, fourteen years, two months and twenty-one days, in the establishment of this work, after he organized the first branch, with six members on the 6th day of April, 1830. [##Doctrine and Covenants 20##]He was martyred on the 27th June, 1844. What did he accomplish, raised up, as he was, in the midst of a gener- 
 152 THE DESERET NEWS. April 24DISCOURSEBy Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF,delivered in the New Tabernacle,Salt Lake City, April, 6,1872.REPORTED BY D. W. EVANS.THROUGH the mercy and loving kindness of our father in the heaven we are again permitted to meet in general conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Forty-two years ago this day this church was organized with six members, by a prophet of the living God, raised up in these last days by the administration of angels from God, and ordained unto all the keys and powers of the Melchizedec priest-hood and apostleship, and of the kingdom of God on the earth. According to the best knowledge we have, 1842 years ago to-day, the Lord Jesus was crucified on Mount Calvary for the sins of the world. [##Matthew 27:50##] The 6th day of April is a very important day in many respects. It has certainly been very interesting to the Latter-day Saints to watch the history and progress of this church and kingdom during the last forty-two years. This is one of the most import-ant generations that men, or God, or angels have ever seen on the earth: it is a dispensation and generation when the whole flood of prophecy and revelation and vision given through inspired men for the last six thousand years is to have its fulfillment, and especially in relation to the establishment of the great kingdom and Zion of God on the earth. Joseph Smith was one of the greatest prophets God ever raised up on the earth, and the Lord has had his eye upon him from the foundation of the world. Any man who has ever read the book of Isaiah, which we frequently have quoted to us, can see that he, with other prophets, had his eye upon the latter-day Zion of God. He says in one place, "Sing O heavens, rejoice O earth, break forth into singing, O ye mountains, for the Lord hath comforted his people, he will have mercy upon his afflicted. But Zion said: The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me." "Ah," says the Lord, "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me." [##Isaiah 49:13-16##]The Lord never created this world at random; he has never done any of his work at random. The earth was created for certain purposes, and one of these purposes was its final redemption, and the establishment of his government and kingdom upon it in the latter days, to prepare it for the reign of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose right it is to reign. That set time has come, that dispensation is before us, we are living in the midst of it. It is before the Latter-day Saints, it is before the world; whether or not the people have more faith in the promises of God now than they had in the days of Noah makes no dif-ference, the unbelief of men will not make the truth of God without effect. The great and mighty events that the Lord Almighty has decreed from before the foundation of the world, to be performed in the latter days are resting upon us, and they will follow each other in quick succession, whether men believe or not, for no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpre-tation, but holy men of God spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost, and what they said will come to pass; though the heaven and the earth pass away not one jot or tittle of the word of the Lord will go unfulfilled.Some of us have lived in, and been inti-mately acquainted with this church for the last forty years, a very few more than that, and some less; but where is the Latter-day Saint or any other person who has ever seen this church or kingdom go back-ward? No matter what position we were in, whether exterminated by the order of Governor Boggs of Missouri, or whether we lay, sick and afflicted, on the muddy banks of the Missouri river; whether it was Zion's Camp going up for her redemption; whether it was the pioneers coming to these mountains, making the roads, build-ing the bridges, killing the snakes and opening the way for the gathering of the people, no matter what our circumstances may have been this kingdom has been onward and upward all the day long until the present hour. Will it ever go back-ward? No, it will not. This Zion of the Lord, in all its beauty, power and glory is engraven upon the hands of Almighty God, and it is before his face continually; his de-crees are set and no man can turn them aside.There never was a dispensation on the earth when prophets and apostles, the in-spiration, revelation and power of God, the holy priesthood and the keys of the king-dom were needed more than they are in this generation. There never has been a dispensation when the friends of God and righteousness are among the children of men needed more faith in the promises and pro-phecies than they do to-day; and there cer-tainly never has been a generation of people on the earth that has had a greater work to perform than the inhabitants of the earth in the latter days. That is one reason why this church and kingdom has progressed from its commencement until to-day, in the midst of all the opposition, oppression and warfare which have been waged against it by men inspired by the evil one. If this had not been the dispensation of the fulness of times—the dispensation in which God has declared that he will establish his kingdom on the earth never more to be thrown down, the inhabitants of the earth would have been enabled to overcome the kingdom and Zion of God in this, as well as in any former dispensation. [##Daniel 2:44##] But the set time has come to favor Zion, and the Lord Almighty has decreed in the heavens that every weapon formed against her shall be broken. And if we take the history of any man, from the days Joseph Smith received the plates from the hill Cumorah, and translated the Book of Mormon by the Urim and Thummim, until to-day, who-ever has raised his hand against this work has felt the chastening hand of Almighty God upon him; and I am at the defiance of the world to show me a President, govern-or, judge, ruler, priest or anybody else on the earth who has taken a stand against this kingdom who is an exception, and you may search their whole history. We have outlived several generations of our persecutors. Where are the men who tarred and feathered Joseph Smith, in Portage Co.,Ohio? Where are the men who drove this people from Kirkland. Where are the men who drove the church and kingdom from Jackson County, Missouri? Where are the men who undertook to kidnap the prophet while in Illinois? Where are they who drove the Latter-day Saints from Illinois into these mountains? Trace their whole history, and see for yourselves. The fact is many of them are in their graves, await-ing their final judgment. And in the whole history of this people and their remarkable preservation the invisible hand of God is as plainly to be seen as it has been in the history of the Jews from the days of Christ until now; and it will continue until this scene is wound up.We are led by men who are filled with inspiration. Joseph Smith was a man of God, through the loins of the ancient Joseph who through the wisdom which God gave him, redeemed his father's house after having been sold by his brethren into Egypt. All the blessings that old father Jacob pronounced upon Joseph and upon the son's of Ephraim, his sons and grandsons,have rested upon them until this dayJoseph Smith was through that lineage. In his youth he was inspired of God, and was administered to by angels. Under their guidance and counsel he laid the foun-dation of this work, and lived long enough to receive all the keys necessary for bearing off this dispensation. He lived long enough to have these individuals administer unto him—John the Baptist, Peter, James and John the Apostles, Elisha and Elijah, who held the keys of turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers; and Moroni, who held the keys of the stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim, to come forth in the latter day, administered in person to Joseph Smith, and gave him these records and in-structed him in the things of God from time to time, until he was qualified and pre-pared to lay the foundation of this work. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:30-50, 59##]The Prophet Joseph lived to see the church organized with apostles and Prophets, pa-triarchs, pastors, teachers, helps, go-vernments, and all the gifts and graces of the spirit of God; to give the Twelve Apostles their endowments and to seal upon their heads all the authority and power that were necessary to enable them to fulfil their missions. Why did the Lord take him away? He laid down his life, and sealed his testimony with his blood that it might be in force upon the heads of this generation, and that he might be crowned with crowns of glory, immortality and eternal life; that he might go to the other side of the vail, and there organize the church and kingdom in this last dispensation. He and his two brothers were taken away into the spirit world, and they are at work there; while Brigham Young and the quorum of the Twelve were preserved on the earth for a special purpose in the hands of God. These things are true, and the hand of the Lord has been over Brigham Young, although, now, he is under bonds and a prisoner, and has his privileges curtailed for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. Yet in the midst of all this he is calm and composed beforethe Lord, and has his mind open to the things of God. He still lives in the midst of this people and will live as long as the Lord wishes him to remain in the flesh to guide the affairs of Zion.I will say to the Latter-day Saints that we have been more blessed in this land than any other dispensation or generation of men. The Lord has been at work for the last three hundred years preparing this land, with a government and constitution which would guarantee equal rights and privileges to the inhabitants thereof, in the midst of which he could establish his king-dom. The kingdom is established, the work of God is manifest in the earth, the Saints have come up here into the valleys of the mountains, and they are erecting the house of God in the tops thereof, for the nations to flow unto. A standard of truth has been lifted up to the people; and, from the com-mencement of this work, the Latter-day Saints have been fulfilling that flood of revelation and prophecy which was given formerly concerning this great work in the last days. I rejoice in this, and also be-cause we have every reason to expect a continuation of these blessings unto Zion. We have always had a vail over us, we have had to walk by faith all the day long until the present time: this is the decree of God. When we were driven from Jack-son County, Clay county, Caldwell county, Kirtland, and finally from Nauvoo into these mountains, we did not see and un-derstand what lay before us: there was a vail over our faces in a measure. It has been the same with the people of God in all ages. At that time we could not see this tabernacle, and the five hundred miles of villages, towns, cities, gardens, orchards, fields, or the desert blossoming as the rose as we see them to-day. We came here and found a barren desert; we were led hither by inspiration, by a law-giver, by a man of God; the Lord was with him, he was with the pioneers. If we had not come here we could not have fulfilled the prophecies which the prophets have left on record in the stick of Judah as well as in the stick of Ephraim—the Bible and the Book of Mor-mon. [##Ezekiel 37:16-20##] We have done that, and we can look back twenty-four years and see the change that has been effected since our arrival; but who can see the change that will be effected in the next twenty-four years? No man can see it unless the vision of his mind is opened by the power of God. The Lord told Joseph Smith to lay the foundation of this work; he told him that the day had come when the harvest was ready, and to thrust in the sickle and reap; and every man who would do so was called of God and had this privilege.The Lord has sent forth the gospel, and it is offered to the children of men as it was in ancient days; men are required to have faith in Jesus Christ, repent of their sins, and to be baptized for the remission of them, and the promise is that they shall receive the Holy Ghost, which shall teach them the things of God, bring things past to their remembrance and show them things to come.What principle has sustained the elders of Israel for the last forty years in their travels? They have gone forth without purse or scrip, preached without money or price; they have swam rivers, waded swamps, and travelled hundreds of thousands of miles on foot to bear recordof this work to the nations of the earth. What has sustained them? It has been this power of God, this Holy Ghost, the spirit of inspiration from the God of Israel that has been given to his friends on the earth in these latter days. The blood of Israel has flowed in the veins of the children of men, mixed among the gentile nations, and when they have heard the sound of the gospel of Christ it has been like vivid lightning to them; it has opened their understandings, enlarged their minds and enabled them to see the things of God. They have been born of the spirit and then they could behold the kingdom of God; they have been baptized in water and had hands laid upon them for the re-ception of the Holy Ghost, and they have received that Holy Ghost among every gentile nation under heaven wherever the gospel has been permitted to be preached; and here they are to-day, from all those nations, gathered in the valleys of the mountains. And this is but the beginning; it is like a mustard seed, it is very small; but the little one is to become a thousand and the small one a strong nation. The Lord will hasten it in his own time. Zion shall be called a "City sought out." [##Isaiah 62:11-12##] The Lord is watching over us.I wish to say to the Latter-day Saints, we must not forget our position, nor the blessings that we hope for. All that we expect, we have got to enquire of the Lord for. Some of our brethren, as has been said here, have suffered a little through the spirit of bigotry and perse-cution that is in the world. I wonder many times there is not a great deal more of it. The Lord Almighty is going to make a short work in the earth; lest no flesh should be saved he will cut his work short in righteousness. The Lord is putting his hook into the jaws of the nations. He holds Great Babylon in his hand as well as Zion. He will control the children of men; and, as the Lord God lives, if the Latter-day Saints do their duty—live their religion, and keep their covenants, Zion will arise, put on her beautiful garments, be clothed with the glory of God, have power in the earth, and the law will go forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. Then let our prayers ascend into the ears of the Lord God of Sab-aoth, for he will hear them, that the wisdom of the wise may perish and the understanding of the prudent be hid. Our weapons are faith prayer, and confidence in God, for he is our friend if we have any, and we are his if he has any on the face of the earth. The Lord will work with us, and we should work with him; therefore brethren, let us live by faith, walk by faith, overcome by faith, so that we may enjoy the Holy Spirit to guide and direct us. All the institutions pertaining to the work of God in these latter days are going to progress, Zion is bound to arise, and to arrive at that position in our great future that the prophets have seen by prophecy and revelation.I want to say a few words to the sisters, who have been referred to this morning—the Female Relief Societies. Our mothers, sisters, wives and daughters occupy a very impor-tant position in this generation, far more so than they realize or understand. You are rais-ing up your sons and daughters as plants of renown in the house of Israel in these latter-days. Upon the shoulders of you mothers rests, in a great measure, the responsibility of correctly developing the mental and moral powers of the rising generation whether in infancy, child-hood, or still riper years Your husbands—the fathers of your children, are messengers to the nations of the earth, or they are engaged in business and can not be at home to attend to the children. No mother in Israel should let a day pass over her head without teaching her children to pray. You should pray yourselves, and teach your children to do the same, and you should bring them up in this way, that when you have passed away, and they take your places in bearing off the great work of God, they may have principles instilled into their minds that will sustain them in time and in eternity. I have often said it is the mother who forms the mind of the child. Take men, anywhere, at sea, sinking with their ship, dy-ing in battle, lying down in death almost un-der any circumstances, and the last thing they think of, the last word they say is "mother." Such is the influence of woman. Our children should not be neglected: they should receive a proper education in both spiritual and tem-poral things. That is the best legacy any pa-rents can leave to their children. We should teach them to pray, and instil into their minds while young every correct principle. Ninety-nine out of every hundred children, who are taught by their parents the principles of hon-esty and integrity, truth and virtue, will ob-serve them through life. Such principles will exalt any people or nation who make them the rule of their conduct. Show me a mother who prays, who has passed through the trials of life by prayer, who has trusted in the Lord God of Israel in her trials and difficulties, and her children will follow in the same path. These things will not forsake them when they come to act in the kingdom of God.I want to say to our mother[s] in Israel, your children are approaching a very important day and age of the world. In a few more years their parents will pass away. We will go where our brethren have gone—to the other side of the vail. Our children will remain and will possess this kingdom when God's judgments await the nation of the earth, when war, calam-ity, sword, fire, famine, pestilence and earth-quake will stalk abroad and distress the people. Our children should be prepared to build up the Kingdom of God. Then qualify them in the days of childhood for the great duties they will be called upon to perform; and that God may enable us to do so is my prayer for Christ's sake, Amen. 
 of the nations of the world at this time, must know that religion is a very popular thing—it has many followers; and they must also know that the religions of the day are very diversified; and that they are in a great measure framed to meet the conveniences, traditions, and situations of the children of men, with but little regard to the declarations of the Bible, or the revelations of Jesus Christ. Every man that will read the scripture of the Old and New Testaments, will see that there was an organization in the days of Jesus Christ, a system for the salvation of the children of men. It is laid down plainly and definitely for the inhabitants of the earth to follow. But, if we search throughout the earth at this day, we cannot find a system existing that has scarcely any resemblance to the example laid down by Christ and the apostles. And I will here say that the persecution, opposition, and oppression that this Church has met with from itsfirst organization, has been in a great measure in consequence of carrying out that very system, those very ordinances, that same Gospel which Jesus Christ and his apostles established in their day, and which cost the most of them their lives.The New Testament clearly shows that when-ever God has had a people upon the earth—when he has had a church and kingdom in the world, it has been organized with prophets and apostles,and has been endowed with revelations, with divers kinds of gifts, with healing power, with miracles, with dreams, and I may say with every member that belongs to the body of Christ, ne-cessary for the edifying of the body, for the work of the ministry, or sanctifying of the people.We cannot find anywhere within the lids of the Bible, where the Lord ever had a people he ac-knowledged, except they were led by immediate revelation. The Lord never had a people in any age of the world without prophets to lead them, even to the present day; and this is the reason why this church and kingdom is so diverse from the views, feelings, and traditions of the nations around us, and that has caused it to meet with great opposition, persecution, and opposing spi-rits from the commencement, and perhaps may continue to do so until the winding up scene.Many of the Prophets have prophesied that such an order of things as that which Christ and his apostles established, should again be establishedin the last days, after ages of apostacy and dark-ness. When the Jews fell through unbelief, asthe Apostle says, the gospel was taken from them and given to the Gentiles. Did the kingdom go to the Gentiles stripped of any of its powers, or portion of its organization because the Jews would not receive it? No, verily it did not. When the kingdom was presented to the Gentiles, it was presented with apostles and prophets, with heal-ing powers, with revelations direct from God, and with every gift and grace the Jews believed in, and enjoyed while they remained faithful: when it went to the Gentiles it was perfect in its organization, but in process of time they changed the ordinances of the kingdom of God, and fell through the same example of unbelief, and have remained for centuries without the true order ofheaven among them.Ask any portion of Christendom why the an-cient order of the Church of Christ is not among them—apostles, prophets, revelations, and other gifts, and they will inform you that they were only needed in the dark ages of the world, to establish the kingdom of God, but in this enlight-ened age are not necessary. It makes me think of a remark made by Mr. Kirkham in his Gram-mar; he says, "The Lord hung the Bible out of heaven, and retired." It appears so indeed among the Gentile nations, for in process of time the gifts, and graces, and powers of the kingdom of God were taken away, and the men who offi-ciated in the ancient Church of God were nearly all put to death; they were slain because they endeavored to maintain it in its purity, and tried with all their might to establish the principles that God had revealed to the Jews, for they were the chosen people of God, the promised seed; butthey fell because they would not receive the Mes-siah, the Shilo, their Savior; when they put him to death, and imbrued their hands in the best blood that had flowed through the lineage of Judah, they had to foot the bill; blood was shed, the laws of God were broken, the ordinances were changed, and the Priesthood of High Heaven trampled upon: the Jews must, therefore, suffer to pay the debt they contracted. Jesus Christ told them what would come upon them before he was taken away, for he mourned over them, say-ing, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate." [##Matthew 23:37-38##]Again, he says to them, "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets; wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the pro-phets. Fill ye up the measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?" [##Matthew 23:29-33##] Again, "Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue, and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone." [##Matthew 23:23##] He also told them that their temple would be destroyed, and not one stone be left upon another that would not be thrown down, and thus they had to suffer until the times of the Gentiles should be fulfilled. Jesus Christ lifted up his voice, and spared not, for he knew what was awaiting that nation; and his heart yearned over them when he saw them as a nation rushing madly on to destruction, and sowing seed that would cause a thousand years of sorrow and mourning by their posterity. They had their agency to act upon as seemed them good, and they became wicked and corrupt, and instituted their own systems of religion and ordinances, instead of the true order of the kingdom of heaven. Jesus told them they would be dispersed among the Gentiles, and be trodden down and afflicted by them until the times of the Gentiles should be accomplished.We understand from the Scriptures, that have been referred to from time to time in this desk, that the Lord will set His hand again to gather Israel. We heard this subject treated upon a few Sabbaths ago, and what would take place in thelast dispensation, even in the dispensation of the fulness of times.But those who have been taught after the trad-itions of the fathers, have been taught that the Bible should be spiritualized, that it does not mean what it says, nor say what it means; we have been taught to believe that where the Lord says Israel shall be gathered, it means spiritually. When we read any portion of scripture, which did not agree with our traditions, every man had his own system of spiritualizing, to make it bend to his own views. Instead of this, we have now learned that God means what He says, and says what He means.When we read the history of the United States, or the history of General Washington, no man in his sober senses would have the least idea of spiritualizing it. When we read the history of our revolutionary fathers, who sat in solemn council to deliberate upon and sign the Declara-tion of Independence, because of the grievances they were called upon to bear from the mother country, no man would for a moment dream of spiritualizing these events; but every man would understand that the historian meant them to be read and understood literally.Now, if we so read and believe the history of the foundation of our national government, or the history of the Jewish nation, or any other nation, that has been written by men who do not make any pretensions to inspiration, if we should never think of spiritualizing their writings, but take them and understand them as they are given to us, why should we take it upon ourselves to spiritualize and twist the words, and the meaning of the words, of that God who rules the nations?When He gives to us revelations of the great-est moment to us, will He not set forth His mind and will in their true meaning, as He intends they shall be fulfilled, and as He intends we shall understand them? The Latter-day Saints as a people have learned to take God at His word. We admit that there are in the Bible metaphors, fi-gures, and parables.When Jesus was teaching the women the things of the kingdom of God, he used compari-sons which they understood. Hence he says, "The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened." [##Matthew 13:33##] He knew the women understood about making bread. And so he talks to the farmer about sowing grain, that some sow seed on good ground, and others on stony ground, and others among thorns, liken-ing the kingdom of heaven unto it. He used these metaphors to make a deeper impression upon the minds of the children of men; and at other times he used dark sayings in the same way. We understand a figure as a figure, and a parable as a parable, but the meaning of the Savior is plainly manifest in them.When the Lord says by the mouth of his proph-et, "And the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry shod. And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt;" [##Isaiah 11:15-16##] and again, "And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy moun-tain Jerusalem, saith the Lord, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord:" [##Isaiah 66:20##] again, when he says, "They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them; I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble; for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn;" we believe he means what he says, for we have ourselves seen many of these prophecies literally fulfilled in this generation. [##Jeremiah 31:9##] Again, we believe he means what he says, when the Lord declares through his Prophet, that an angel shall fly through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6##] We believe he means what he says. To fulfil this declaration we believe it is necessary for an angel of God to come to the earth and de-liver the gospel—the true gospel, and the only gospel that ever was revealed for the exaltation and glory of man.Why does it require an angel to bring the gospel from heaven in these last days, when the earth is deluged with gospel, with religion, with different systems and plans of salvation? Be-cause that none of them are according to the order, organization that God has given to govern and control the human family when they would be controlled by him. If there had been a true organization of the kingdom of God upon the earth in these latter days, there would have been no need of an angel to visit the earth to teach men the first principles of the gospel of Christ, and administer its ordinances to them.When the apostles of old dwelt upon the earth, the angel that appeared to Saul of Tarsus, and the angel that appeared to Cornelius did not adminis-ter the Gospel to them, but instructed them to apply to those men whom Christ had ordained to that authority, and who held the keys, the gifts and graces, and priesthood of the kingdom of God. [##Acts 10##]So it would have been in the last days, if there had been authority, and the true priesthood of God on the earth; there would, in that case, have been no necessity for an angel to come with the gospel.Angels are sent as ministering spirits to minis-ter to those who shall be heirs of salvation. We believe the Lord means what he says. We be-lieve Israel were led formerly by prophets who were full of wisdom and truth; and they are a-gain to be led by holy prophets, that have the priesthood of the Most High upon them, and power to lead and to teach the children of men.When Daniel the prophet declared that the king-dom of God should be set up in the last days, andthat it should break in pieces all other kingdoms, and have no end, he meant what he said.  [##Daniel 2:44#] Whenwe read the prophecies that declare unto us thatgreat wickedness shall be upon the earth in the latter days, and that great plagues will be poured out upon the world; that angels are to pour outthe vials of the wrath of the Almighty, and that previous to this all men are to be warned by the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, we believe those declarations will have a literal ful-filment.Before I ever heard of Mormonism, when reading the Scriptures, I often wondered why itwas that we had no prophets, no apostles, no gifts and graces, no healings by the power of God, no visions, no angels, no revelations, no voice of God. I often wondered why these things werenot continued among the children of men, why they were not enjoyed by the different churches and denominations of the day, and in my con-versation with theologians and divines, I often re-ferred to these things, but they all told me thatsuch supernatural manifestations were unnecessary in our day and age of the world, that such power as only necessary in a day of darkness, among an ignorant generation of people, they needed prophets to lead them; but we who live in the blaze of gospel light need no such thing; we needno revelation, only that which is in the Bible; weneed no visitation of angels now, those thingswere given to establish the doctrine of Christ, and when it was once established they were no longerneeded.This logic always appeared strange to me. I said then and I say now, may the Lord give mesuch periods of darkness as were enjoyed by theApostles and saints of old, in preference to the gospel blaze of modern Christianity. The ancient doctrine and power will unlock the mysteries of heaven, and pour forth that gospel light, know-ledge, and truth, of which the heavens are full, and which has been poured out in every generationwhen prophets appeared among the children of men. But the gospel of modern Christendom shuts up the Lord, and stops all communication with Him. I want nothing to do with such a gos-pel, I would rather prefer the gospel of the dark ages, so called.I do not wish to be understood that we arenow living in a dark age of the world, but for the last fourteen hundred years the world have been enveloped in darkness, in which wickedness has ruled, and the powers of darkness have prevailed among the children of men, and the nations havebeen bound down by false traditions, and incor-rect principles, but the day has now dawned, the dark clouds have now broken up and soon willpass away, and the sun of righteousness will arise in its glory, and show forth the light of heaven; and for that I am thankful, and rejoice, and so do thousands and tens of thousands in this dispen-sation who have been touched with the light ofthe glorious gospel of Jesus Christ which has been revealed in our day by the administering of holy angels in all its fulness, beauty, power, and glory; this gospel has caused prophets, elders, and saints to rejoice; it has nerved up their spirits with fortitude and strength and borne them up a-gainst every opposing influence; this has been the case in every dispensation when this light and power has been enjoyed by the children of men.The gospel has gone forth in our day in itstrue glory, power, order, and light, as it always did when God had a people among men that he acknowledged. That same organization and gos-pel that Christ died for, and the apostles spilled their blood to vindicate, is again established in this generation. How did it come? By the minister-ing of an holy angel from God, out of heaven, who held converse with man, and revealed untohim the darkness that enveloped the world, and unfolded unto him the gross darknessthat surrounded the nations, those scenesthat should take place in this generation, and would follow each other in quick successioneven unto the coming of the Messiah.The angel taught Joseph Smith those principleswhich are necessary for the salvation of the world; and the Lord gave him commandments, and sealed upon him the priesthood, and gave himpower to administer the ordinances of the houseof the Lord. He told him the gospel was not a-mong men, and that there was not a true organ-ization of his kingdom in the world, that the peo-ple had turned away from his true order, changed the ordinances and broken the everlasting cove-nant, and inherited lies and things wherein their was no profit.He told him the time had come to lay the foundation for the establishment of the Kingdom of God among men for the last time preparatoryto the winding up scene. Joseph was strength-ened by the spirit and power of God, and was enabled to listen to the teachings of the angel. He told him he should be made an instrument in the hands of the Lord, if he kept His command-ments, in doing a good work upon the earth, thathis name should be held in honor by the honest in heart, and in dishonor throughout the nations by the wicked. He told him he should be an instru-ment in laying the foundation of a work thatshould gather tens of thousands of the children of men, in the generation in which he lived, from every nation under heaven who should hear the sound of it through his instrumentality. He told him the nations were wrapt in wickedness and abomination, and that the judgments of God wereready to be poured out upon them in their ful-ness; that the angels were holding the vials of hiswrath in readiness, but the decree is, that they shall not be poured out until the nations are warn-ed, that they may be left without an excuse.This man to whom the angel appeared obeyed the gospel; he received it in meekness and humility,and bowed down before the Lord and worshippedhim, and did the best he could in his illeterate state, he was as it were but a mere plowboy. He laid hold of it with all his heart, though he saw he would have to wage war with sin, and wicked-ness, and abominations, and the oppositions ofthe people; he began to trust in the Lord; andwhat was the consequence? Wherever the words of the gospel, which the angel revealed to him, were preached among the children of men, it hashad its effect. The church was at length organ-ized with a few humble men. The learned mightlaugh at them because of their ignorance, buttheir words were like daggers to their hearts, and like a two-edged sword, piercing and dividing as-sunder the very thoughts and intents of the hearts of men. The honest in heart began to receivetheir testimony, and it continued to spread from town to town, from city to city, from state to state, and from nation to nation, until we see the fruits of it here to-day in this Tabernacle of theLord in the tops of the mountains.I say I rejoice before the Lord this day that wehave leaders in Israel that are qualified for their place and station to preside over this people, and who will seek their welfare, and are not afraid or ashamed to rebuke wickedness in high places, whether manifested by their brethren or neigh-bors if they do wrong. Their minds are quickas the vivid lightning of heaven; they are filled with the visions of eternity; they are not asleep, but they comprehend the elements around them; they read and digest them, and they know exactly what course to pursue; the leaders of this peopleknow what they are doing, what is approachingthis people, and what is approaching the world: and we may all know the same things by reading the Scriptures, and by prayer, and through the min-istering of the Holy Ghost conferred upon us.What man is their who reads the Scriptures, and believes that God means what he says, and sayswhat he means but what can see a flood of dread-ful events ready to be poured out upon this gene-ration with the rapidity of lightning. No man can escape the influence of these events that are about to burst upon the heads of this generation. The gospel has gone forth, and when the nationsare warned, another angel will cry 'Babylon isfallen.' War and famine and the plague willoverwhelm the nations of the earth, and none can escape.As Latter Day Saints, we look upon the signs of the times, we are not ignorant of them, but we understand them. We look upon the events thatare rolling upon us with great interest. It mat-ters not what the minds and feelings of men are, the Lord is determined to raise up a people thatwill worship him; and if he has to whip, and scourge, and drive us through a whole generation,he will chastise us until we are willing to submit to righteousness and truth, or until we are likeclay in the hands of the potter. The chastise-ments we have had from time to time have been for our good, and are essential to learn wisdom,and carry us through a school of experience wenever could have passed through without. I hope then, that we may learn from the experience wehave had to be faithful, and humble, and be pas-sive in the hands of God and do his command-ments. Do I blame President Young because he chastises us? No. Would he be a father to us,a Prophet, and a High Priest of God, if he saw his brethren going wrong, and would not warnand chastise them? The chastisement of a friendis far better than the kisses of an enemy. When I am out of the way, and when you are out of the way I thank God that we have a man to pre-side over us, who loves us enough to chastise us;it is for our good, and I believe we have been al-ways ready to receive the chastening rod from our superiors when they thought fit to give it to us,and kiss the rod that chastened us. If a prophetis called to lead and chastise Israel, shall henot rebuke wickedness when it is not in Israel?The very spirit that vibrates in the soul of Presi-dent Young, and every act of his life show to allacquainted with him, that he will do his duty inthis respect, as well as in every thing else wherein he stands connected, while he dwells upon the earth, regardless of all consequences, and will leave the event in the hands of God, and his councilors are governed by the same spirit and principles. The Lord has reprov-ed the wicked in all ages and he will do it again. He also inspires his servants to reprove and re-buke wickedness; he controls all nations, and the destiny of the world is in his hands as much now as it was in the days of Israel when he himselfled them out of the land of Canaan.Wickedness is in the earth, and satan has great power over the hearts of men, and he seeksto destroy them, and he seeks to destroythis people, and lead away the elders of Israel; and when he overcomes a man that has made a covenant with God, who has been bap-tized in this church and kingdom he gains a great-er victory over him, than over one who nevermade any profession. Why have old grey-headed Israelites turned their faces for generations past towards Jerusalem, and lifted up their voices and mourned in sorrow? Because their fathers had rejected the Messiah and broken their covenantswith God. Why are these Lamanites roaming about in misery and wretchedness living upon reptilesof the earth: why are they cursed so bitterly, and brought down so low, for they are of the seed of Israel? It is because the chastening rod of the Almighty has rested upon them and upon their fathers. We should be very cautious and carefulto keep the commandments of God and do rightwhile we have such examples of the dealings of God with the nations who have broken his laws. We shall be corrected in all our errors, that wemay become sanctified, and be prepared for those glories, principles, powers, and privileges whichthe Lord has promised to reveal to us. 
 When I first met the train of hand carts mysoul was full, the scene was overwhelming, our hearts were swollen, as br. Kimball saidtill they felt as though they were as big as a two bushel basket. Was it sorrow that pro-duced this? No, but joy; and why so? Be-cause it looked as if the very flood-gates ofdeliverance were opened, and as if we could say to the starving millions 'Come home to Zion, and improve the opportunity that is now open and renew your covenants, reform your-selves in your lives and conduct.'President Brigham Young has talked about this plan for some time before it came before the public; he has felt that an improvement and change must take place in relation to the gath-ering of the people as well as a reformation of life of all those who were gathered.Whatever council the Presidency of this church has been led to give unto this people it has been dictated by the Spirit and power of God and our safety and salvation lies in obey-ing that council and putting it practice. We should learn to listen to the operation and manifestation of the Spirit of Truth.When Prest. Young launched forth into the wilderness, leading the pioneer camp, to seek a new location and home as a resting place for the Saints, there were many men that felt asthough it was a wild speculation, they thought it was taking a stand that was dangerous, but were they men of faith? They might well feel so if they had not the Spirit of God, but all those that were governed and controled by the right spirit felt as he did and that God wasleading him, and that he would lead the people right; and it is so with the hand-cart trains.We should learn a lesson by this hand cart operation as we should by every other opera-tion of the servants of God. I know how it looks to the Saints, but Mormonism to men that have not the Spirit of God is a great mys-tery and a strange work indeed, they do not understand the ways or work of God; it looks to them like leading the people to destruction,but in all cases where destruction comes in all ages of the world it is where the councils of the Prophets of God are not fully carried out, but where the people deviate in some measure from their council. And this was fully mani-fest in the days of the ancient prophets as well as in our day.The word of the Lord and the words of his servants have been proved many times and that before our eyes, our leaders were led by the Spirit of God, and I can bear testimony that our Prophets and leaders have the Spiritof the Lord, and they are clothed upon with the holy priesthood of God and all the powers and keys thereof and with the holy anointing, and are fully authorized and qualified to build up the kingdom of God upon the earth; they are inspired by the very same spirit that the ancients were; they want to build up the king-dom of God, this is their object.When I saw br. Ellsworth come into this city covered with dust and drawing a handcart, I felt that he had gained greater honor than the riches of this world could bestow, and he looked better to me than he would have done had he been clothed with the most costly apparel that human ingenuity can produce; helooked better I say to me than a man adorned with jewels and finery of every description. The honor any man can obtain by his faithful-ness in this cause and kingdom is worth far more than all the honors and riches of the world.The elders of this church have been inspiredwhile on their missions abroad among the na-tions of the earth; they have had the Spirit of the Lord and they have borne it forth amongthe people, and we can see the spirit by which they have been governed in their works. I feel thankful that the Lord has heard ourprayers in their behalf, for these men have been remembered; there has not been a prayer offered up by a man or a woman in Israel who have enjoyed the Spirit of the Lord, but they have offered their prayers and exercised their faith in behalf of and in favor of those men; they have prayed for the 'hand-cart company'that they might be strong and be able to per-form their duties, and we have prayed that they might be preserved from cholera, from sickness and from the power of the destroyer,and these prayers have ascended up on high and entered into the ears of the God of Sab-aaoth, and our brethren have felt the power of them; they felt as br. Ellsworth said he felt,viz.: that they had the prayers and faith of their friends in Zion.Do I look upon these brethren and sistersthat come in with hand carts with any less degree of respect than I should if they hadcome with horses, with dromedaries, with mules and swift beasts? No, I do not; but Ifeel that they have accomplished a good workin thus coming to Zion, in the way the Presi-dency have pointed out.I feel to rejoice also to see the Spirit andpower of God poured out so powerfully upon the Presidency of the church and those who have been faithful either at home or those who have been on missions abroad.The Presidency of the church are calling upon us as a people to repent and put off oursins. It is right, it is just that we should awake and reform for we have got to have the same spirit; we have to wake up from the deep sleep and slumbering condition in which we find ourselves. We must arise to a sense of our position and to understand the signs of thetimes, and become acquainted with what the Lord requires at our hands.I am satisfied and have been for some lengthof time that the Lord would open some way of relief for the poor Saints; it would require all the Saints that are upon the earth with their means—I was going to say that it would re-quire all the means in the world to bring thepoor in the way they have been gathering. There must be a change in the way of the gathering in order to save them from the cal-amities and the scourges that are coming upon the wicked nations of the earth. It would re-quire more gold than all the Saints possess upon the earth to gather the Saints unto Zionfrom all nations in the way they have been gathering, but now the hand-cart operationhas been introduced to this people, it will bring five here to where one has been broughtheretofore.I rejoice in all those men who have stood up to their posts as men of God and defended the words of His servants, and assisted in carrying out their plans and designs in gathering the people from the nations; they have been in-spired by the power of the great God, and theyhave carried the words of his servants intooperation with success, and had it not been sothe devil would have gained a great victory over the Saints; they have conquered and this has been the case in every operation that we as a people have taken in hand under the direc-tion of the servants of God.The moment that you take in hand any newoperation in the kingdom of God that moment youhave to renew your warfare, and the Saints will find that wherein they undertake any newenterprize and are sent to the nations of theearth the devil will be up against them. Look how he raged when the Prophet Joseph com-menced preaching upon this continent, and then again when we went from this country to Europe it seemed as if all hell was let loose. As soon as brs. Kimball and Hyde arrived in England all the devils in Europe, or in Eng-land at any rate, were let loose upon them, and it was precisely the same in London when thebrethren went there, and I will say still fur-ther it has been so in every place.I thank God that those men that have beenappointed to lead these hand carts have been filled with the Holy Spirit and have had cour-age and faith to carry out the plan designed bythe servants of the Almighty. It is an omennot only to the Jews, but to the gentiles; it shows them that there is a God in Israel whose power and priesthood have been commitedinto the hands of men upon the earth, and their works cause 'the wisdom of the wise to perishand the understanding of the prudent to be hid;' and this power and principle is felt by the great and the mighty among men.I feel thankful that the Lord has preserved our brethren the missionaries and that they have been permitted to return to our midst, and that we have the privilege of greeting them, and that we can rejoice together in the good-ness and mercy of God.I wish to say a few words to the elders. I suppose we are all elders; do you teach yourfamilies the ways of life and salvation? Do you teach your wives and children the counsel of God?  We should impress upon the minds of our children the evil consequences of com-mitting sin or breaking any of the laws of God,they should be made to understand that by do-ing wrong they will inherit sorrow and tribu-lation which they can easily escape by doingright, and they should learn this principle by precept without learning sorrow and affliction by experience from doing wrong.We as a people should be humble, be prayer-ful, be submissive to the powers that be thatwe may receive the promised blessings of our Heavenly Father.I want now to say a few words upon the subject of our reformation. The Presidencyhave called upon us to reform our ways, to re-new our covenants and to commence to live thelives of Saints. I take this liberty because I have the the opportunity of speaking to you. I say then that they have called upon us to put on the whole armor, to reform our conduct. Men having authority have called upon us to forsake our wickedness and our follies, and Imay here say that the Presidency have preach-ed to the people in this Territory, not only for the last month, but for the last year, and I have thought that it was a good deal like throwing a ball against a rock, it did not penetrate butbounded back, but they have told us that wewere asleep as a people, and we have been told of the condition that we are in by the Prophets of God, and as br. Grant has said, we may take the church as a body with the priesthood, with but few exceptions, and we have been asleep. What! should the apostles of Jesus Christ go to sleep, men who ought to have their minds upon nothing else but thethings of the kingdom of God? No, they should not, they should not be asleep, but theyhave not always felt as they should feel.You may take the Twelve, and the Seventiesand High Priests, and all the other quorums,except the First Presidency, and they have beenmore or less asleep. I believe the First Presi-dency have been awake or they would not have known that we were asleep, and they now think that it is time for us to awake and arise from our slumbers, and I feel so too.I will tell you how I feel about it; men bear-ing the Priesthood of God, it is a solemn truth,and you know it as well as I do, that almost all the male members in this land bear theholy priesthood of the Most High, and yet at the same time we have had more stealing, more lying, more swearing in one year than thereshould have been in a thousand; we have had more stealing here in Utah than has been for our credit, and when you have taken up that you may also take up every other sin and pilethem up together and what is our condition be-fore God? Why, we have violated our cove-nants which we made at the waters of baptism. What is the use then of our saying that we have been righteous, that we have been holywhen we have actually been in a sound sleep, when we have been so much out of the way? It is no use whatever for the time of sifting and purifying the Saints has come, and for one I am willing to put on the garment and keep it on until we burn out all the evil that exists.Why will we suffer our hearts to be set upon the things of the world when they should be upon the Lord and the building up of his kingdom? And as long as the angels are ready to write downour actions and the Spirit of God is taken awayfrom the nations of the earth, and they are filled with wickedness and abominations of every kind, and the judgments of God are ready to fall upon the earth for 'Hell has enlarged herself and thepomp and glory of the world will descend into it' And where should men be awake if not here in Zion?It is our duty, brethren, to live in that way andmanner before our God that we will find no diffi-culty in administering in any of the ordinances of the kingdom of God; we should live so that the spirit and power of the Holy Ghost will rest down upon us; we should humble ourselves be-fore the Lord in our closets and live day by day so that we can know what is right and what is wrong, and when the Presidency give us any in-struction or charge, to live so that we will be ready to follow their counsel.I believe that the majority of the people are ready to wake up; I believe that they already be-gin to feel the reformation spirit in them, and it is certainly time for there are great events at our door, and I likewise feel that we will have as much labor upon our hands as we will be able toperform; it is a great and important day that we live in, and when we look upon the work of the Lord as Elders, as High Priests, as Seventies,and as men should who bear the Priesthood, we should never be asleep but be ever ready to do the work of God and to build up his kingdom, for the day is now come when we must awake and become the friends of God; we must not al-low anything to stand between us and our Godor we shall be cut off.There has been a great deal among us which has been wrong and for which we have been re-proved, and I will not hand the garments to my neighbor but I will give every one their due andtake that portion to myself which belongs to me. It has been a custom at times when reproofs have been given and the garment would fit a man tohand it to his neighbor, but I know that but fewof us will escape.I know that I can take the reproof to myself, and I consider that it is one of the greatest vic-tories for a man to gain, to learn how to control himself. Show me a man that does control him-self and I will show you a safe man, or a man that has prepared himself by this principle is on the road to salvation. A man that is prepared to lay all that he hath upon the altar and his life with it, for the gospel's sake and the kingdom ofGod, is in the right way, but the moment that we teach a doctrine that we do not practise we show our weakness. The moment a man or awoman becomes angry they show a great weak-ness, and so with any of us when we do any-thing wrong.I feel, as Prest. Young said, that our Father in heaven is touched with the feelings of our infir-mities, and when I have looked at the magnitude of the work and the nature of our priesthood, and the authority and responsibility which rests upon us and upon all the hosts of Israel, I havefelt oftentimes to mourn and weep over the pas-sions and follies to which man is subject in this life.If men could see and understand their relation-ship to God and the position they occupy, theywould not see one moment of their lives that they would desire to do a wrong thing, but they wouldpursue a straightforward course, they would avoidall kinds of evil words and improper expressions.What was intended by the establishment of the gospel of Jesus Christ? Was it for men to be-come darkened and sleepy? No, for that mo-ment we do we come under condemnation. I say then that we have all been reproved by our brethren. I speak of the reproofs given because they have been among the things foremost beforeour brethren who have preached to us for sometime past.I feel that this call of repentance and baptism for the remission of our sins is an important one,and that we cannot again go to sleep with impu-nity, and I feel that inasmuch as we will walk inthe light, awake from our slumber, repent of oursins, we shall receive the blessings of the Gospel of Christ and all things that pertain to the king-dom of our God.These things that God has given to us throughour Prophets, will prove the savor of life unto lifeor of death unto death.When I was a boy, there was an old man used to visit at my father's house; his name was Robert Mason, and I heard teachings from himfrom the time that I was eight years old and up-upwards, and they were teachings that I shall ever remember, and he taught my father's house-hold many important truths concerning the church and kingdom of God, and told themmany things in relation to the prophets and the things that were coming upon the earth, but histeachings were not received but by few, theywere unpopular with the Christian world, but nearly all that did receive his teachings have join-ed the Latter-day Saints. Prophets were notpopular in that day any more than now, and I have often thought of many things which the oldman taught me in the clays of my youth since I received the fulness of the Gospel and became a member of the Church of Christ.He said when you read the Bible do you ever think that what you read there is going to be ful-filled? The teachers of the day, said he, spiritu-alize the Bible, but when you read in the Bibleabout the dreams, visions, revelations and predic-tions of Ezekiel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, or any other of the prophets or apostles, relative to the gather-ing of Israel and the building up of Zion, where they say that Israel shall be gathered upon litters, swift beasts and dromedaries, you may under-stand that it means just what it says and that it will be fulfilled upon the earth in the last days. And when you read of men laying hands upon the sick, and healing them and casting out devilsand working miracles in the name of Jesus Christ, it means what it says, and he further said the church of Christ and kingdom of God is not upon the earth, but it has been taken from the children of men through unbelief and because they havetaken away from the gospel some of its most sacred ordinances, and have instituted in their stead forms and ceremonies without the power of God, and have turned from the truth unto fables, but said he, it will soon be restored again unto the children of men upon the earth, with its ancient gifts and power, for the Scriptures can-not be fulfilled without it; but I shall not live to see it, but said he to me you will live to see that day and you will become a conspicuous actor in that kingdom, and when you see that day then that which the Prophets have spoken will be ful-filled.And as br. Van Cott said about his fathers and grandfathers, that they did not join any church, it was so with me; I did not join any church be-lieving that the church of Christ in its true or-ganization did not exist upon the earth, but whenthe principles of the everlasting gospel were first proclaimed unto me, I believed it with all my heart and was baptized the first sermon I heard, for the Spirit of God bore testimony to me inpower that it was true.And I believe that I should never have joined any church had I not heard some men preach who had the holy priesthood, but when I heard the fulness of the Gospel I was greatly blessed in receiving it and was filled with joy un-speakable, and I have never been sorry but I have rejoiced all the day long and when I saw that train of hand-carts I thought of the teaching and words of the old prophet Mason, for he camethe nearest to being a true prophet of God in his predictions and works of any man I ever sawuntil I saw men administering in the holy priest-hood.He also cast out devils in the name of Jesus Christ by the laying on of hands and the prayer of faith, but, said he, I have no right to administerin the ordinances of the gospel, neither has any man unless he receives it by revelation from Godout of heaven, as did the ancients. But if my family or friends are sick I have the right to lay hands upon them and pray for them in the name of Jesus Christ, and if we can get faith to be healed it is our privilege; and I will here say that many were healed through his faith and prayers and that too within my knowledge, and when that first hand-cart company came into the city, I indeed thought of the old prophet, for if they did not come with litters it was as near as possi-ble to it, and I now believe that from this timeforth hand carts will be used more than horses, mules and oxen.I thank God that I have lived to see this dayand generation, and I pray God to bless you and me that we may do our duty in our families andamong our friends and in our neighborhoods, and in every circumstance in which we are placed. I also feel thankful to see our brethren and sisters coming in, and especially the missionaries, for they have returned filled with the gifts and powersof the Holy Ghost; it does my soul good and I feel to thank God for these things.When I came into the Tabernacle and saw theofferings that were made I felt satisfied that therewas an improvement, and I will say here that whenever the Prophets who lead us call upon uswe should be ready and on hand to take hold of that wheel which he points to and pull, and whenwe get the spirit of our calling and the power of God upon us, the church and kingdom will grow. As President Young said, the vail will be rent, and when the armies of Gog and Magog arisethey will say let us not go against Israel to battlefor her sons are terrible and we cannot stand.If we as a people follow the council of the Presidency of this church, repent of our sins, wake up, do our duty, keep on the armor of righteousness, live our religion, and are filled with the Holy Ghost we shall soon see that sinners inZion will tremble, and fearfulness will surprize the hypocrite.I feel to bless you, brethren and sisters, and pray that we may do our duty in all things and ever honor the priesthood, and at last be crownedin the church and kingdom of God; I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen.

 DISCOURSEBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVEREDAt the Adjourned General Confer-ence, in the New Tabernacle, SaltLake City, Friday Morning,May 8th, 1874REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.We had a request given to us, at the opening of the Conference, yesterday morning, by President Young, to give evi-dences for and against the United Order of Zion. I do not know that I should be a very able advocate against it. I have beenlooking over, in my own mind, the argu-ments which might be brought against it,and there are a few things I will name. Ifwe were to undertake to unite according to the spirit and letter of this order it would, in one sense of the word, depriveus of having half a dozen candidatesat elections, as is the custom generally in the Christian world. It would, in a measure,deprive these candidates of the opportunityof spending a month or two stump-speech-ing to get the votes of the people; then,when the election came, of paying for two or three barrels of bad whiskey to treatthose who are going to vote for them. Then it might deprive Alderman Clinton, or some other justice of the peace, of the chance of collecting two or three hundreddollars as fines from those who had com-mitted a breach of the peace. It mightdeprive the Benedicts and other surgeons of the opportunity of collecting five hun-dred or a thousand dollars for mendingbroken arms and legs got in free fights. Probably it would deprive the people ofthe opportunity of spending fifty or a hun-dred thousand dollars a year in importing mustard into this Territory, and requirethe farmers to collect and use that which is now a nuisance on their fields. It might also deprive us of the privilege of paying a hundred thousand dollars for imported brooms, and require us to plant two or three hundred acres of broom corn. Theseare about the only objections that I can think of against the order, though you might carry it out in detail, perhaps, a good deal further; but with regard to thebenefits arising from it, they are so numer-ous that it would take a long time to enu-merate them. I do not think it requires a great deal of argument to prove to usthat union is strength, and that a united people have power which a divided people do not possess.I am very glad that I have lived long enough to see a day when the hearts of the people can be united so as to carry out these things, while they also act upon their own agency in receiving and obeying them. We have been a good many years preach-ing up the necessity of the Latter-day Saints being one in temporal as well as in spiritual things, and I have felt, for a long time, in my own mind, that there must be a change among us. The way we have been drifting, has not seemed to have a tendency, as a general thing, to carry out the purposes of the Lord, and to prepare us, as a people, for those events which await us.In our spiritual labors we have been uni-ted in a measure, and in some things perhaps in a temporal point of view. Now, for instance, the case I referred to in regard to our elections. I do not think that, for the twenty-four years we have resided in these valleys, any man has ever paid a six-pence in order to obtain any office to whichhe has been elected by the votes of the peo-ple, whether as Delegate to the Congress of the United States, governor of the Ter-ritory, member of the legislature, probatejudge, or any other office. I do not thinkthat any man who has been in office has ever even asked for it in any shape or man-ner. So far as this is concerned we have been united, and we have one consolation in regard to our officers, I do not believethere has ever been a single defaulteramong them in the whole Territory, so faras dollars and cents are concerned, in any office. In this respect then we see the ad-vantage of being united.There are very many advantages that will accrue to us if we unite our hearts,feelings, labors, interests, property and everything that we are made stewards over. One thing is certain, we can not continue in the course that we have pursued in re-gard to temporal matters. It is suicidal for any people to import ten dollars' worth of products while they export only one,and it is a miracle and a wonder to me that we have lived as long as we have under this order of things. We have sent mil-lions of dollars out of the Territory everyyear for articles for our home consumptionwhile we have exported but very little,hence I say that the establishment and suc-cess of this new order among us will bringabout our temporal salvation.We occupy a different position from the rest of the world. We believe in the revela-tions of Jesus Christ contained in the Bi-ble as well as in the record or stick ofJoseph in the hands of Ephraim,—the Book of mormon, which gives a history ofthe ancient inhabitants of this continent. [##Ezekiel 37:16-19##]We also believe in the book of revelationswhich were given through the mouth of Joseph Smith, the prophet, to the Latter-day Saints and to the inhabitants of the earth. Inasmuch, then, as we believe these things, we, if we carry out our faith, must of necessity go to and prepare our-selves for the fulfillment of the revelations of God. When we are in possession ofthe Spirit of God we understand that thereis a change at the door, not only for us but for all the world. There are certain events awaiting the nations of the earth as well as Zion; and when these events overtake us we will be preserved if we take the counsel that is given us and uniteour time, labor and means, and produce what we need for our own use; but with-out this we shall not be prepared to sus-tain ourselves and we shall suffer loss and inconvenience thereby. I am satisfied that as a people, pursuing the course we have pursued hitherto, we are not prepared for the Zion of Enoch or the kingdom of God. There was an order carried out ancientlyby the people of this continent and by the people of the City of Enoch, wherever that was located, which was very different from the practice which has prevailed among the Saints of latter days; and as far as such a system being any injury to us I can see none in the world. [##Moses 7##] I can see no injury that can overtake the Latter-day Saints, by their uniting together, according to the law of God, and producing from the ele-ments that which they need to eat, drink and wear, and I feel as though the time has come for such an order to be institu-ted; and the readiness with which the peo-ple receive the teachings of the servants of God in regard to this matter is a testi-mony that the time has come to favorZion. The Spirit of God bears witness to the congregations of the Saints of the im-portance of the principles which have been given unto us, and hence their readiness to receive them.From the commencement of this work to the present day, the labor has been hard-er with the servants of God to get the peo-ple prepared in their hearts to let the Lordgovern and control them in their tempor-al labor and means than in regard to mat-ters pertaining to their eternal salvation. It was hard work for Joseph Smith to getthe minds of the people prepared even toreceive the Gospel in his day. But the Lord opened the way, the gospel was preached and the church was organized in its purity and in the order in which it existed in the days of Jesus Christ and the apostles, and wherever the gospel has been sent the ears of the people have been more or less opened and a portion of them have been ready to receive it. This gospel has been preached in every Christian na-tion under heaven where the laws would permit, and people from these various na-tions have overcome their traditions so faras to obey it; but, as I remarked before, it has been hard work for the Latter-day Saints to bring themselves to such a state of mind as to be willing for the Lord to govern them in their temporal labors. There is something strange about this, butI think, probably, it is in consequence of the position that we occupy.  There is avail between man and eternal things; if that vail was taken away and we were able to see eternal things as they are before the Lord, no man would be tried with regard to gold, silver or this world's goods, and no man, on their account, would be un-willing to let the Lord control him. But herewe have an agency, and we are in a proba-tion, and there is a vail between us andeternal things, between us and our heav-enly Father and the spirit world; and thisfor a wise and proper purpose in the Lord our God, to prove whether the children of men will abide in his law or not in the sit-uation in which they are placed here. Lat-ter-day Saints, reflect upon these things.We have been willing, with every feeling of our hearts, that Joseph Smith, President Young, and the leaders of the people should guide and direct us in regard to our eternal interests; and the blessings sealed upon us by their authority reachthe other side of the vail and are in forceafter death, and they affect our destiny to the endless ages of eternity. Men, in the days of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and of Jesus and the Apostles, had blessingssealed upon them, kingdoms, thrones,principalities and powers, with all the blessings of the New and Everlasting Cov-enant. The question may be asked, arethese eternal blessings of interest to us? They are, or should be. Are these bless-ings worth our earthly wealth, whether we have little or much? Is salvation, is eter-nal life worth a yoke of cattle, a house, a hundred acres of land, or anything that we possess here in the flesh? If it is, we certainly ought to be as ready to permit the Lord to govern and control us in all our temporal labors as we are in our spirit-ual labors.Again, when a man dies he can not take his cattle, horses, houses or lands with him; he goes to the grave—the resting place of all flesh. No man escapes it, the law of death rests upon all. In Adam all die, while in Christ all are made alive. [##1 Corinthians 15:22##] Weall understand that death has passed up-on all men, but we none of us know whenour turn will come, though we know itwill not be a great while before we shallbe called to follow the generations who have preceded us. When we reflect upon these things I think we all should be will-ing to let the Lord guide us in temporalmatters. In the Book of Mormon we learn that the ancient Nephites, who dwelt on this continent, entered into, and continued in, this order for nearly twohundred years. They were wealthy and happy and the Lord blessed them. They had no poor among them. They wereunited in heart and in spirit, and the bless-ings of the Lord rested upon them. It istrue they occupied a different position inone sense to what we do. They enteredinto this order just after the Lord had brought judgment upon the whole nationon account of their wickedness, and many of the wicked had been destroyed: their cities had also been destroyed, and it waswhile humbled by these judgments that they entered the United Order. But a reign of peace and prosperity rested upon them and continued until they broke the order and began to go, every man for him-self and the devil for them all, then utterdestruction soon overtook them.It is different with us. We are enter-ing this order before the wicked are de-stroyed. We commence it to prepare us for the great events which are at the door, for if the judgments of God ever were at the door of any generation it is this. The whole volume of Scripture points these things out to us in plain language, and all the unbelief of the inhabitants of the earth will not alter the fact, it will not change the hand of God nor stay his judg-ments, which are at the door of GreatBabylon. She will come in remembrance before God, and he will hold a controversywith the nations; his sword is unsheathed and it will fall on Idumea, the world, and who can stay his hand? These thingshave been proclaimed by almost every prophet who has ever spoken since the world began. They point to our day, andtheir words must have their fulfillment.Over forty years the gospel of Christhas been proclaimed to this generation andto the whole Christian world as far as we have had opportunity. Light has come in-to the world, but men have rejected it be-cause their deeds are evil, hence the judg-ments of God will rest upon the nations of the earth in fulfillment of his word through the prophets. The Lord hascalled upon us to unite together and take hold of this work, and to prepare our-selves for the great events which are athand, that when the destroying angels go forth to reap the earth, beginning at the sanctuary, they need not destroy any man upon whom is the mark set by the writerwith the inkhorn, who cried and mourned because of the abominations done amongmen. The prophet, in seeing the vision of these things in the last days, saw thatthe earth was reaped, and the reapers be-gan at the sanctuary, and the wicked were cut off by the judgments of God.The world now do not believe this anymore than they believed in the days of Noah and Lot, and they are no more pre-pared for it, and they are growing wicked-er and wickeder every day of their lives.Wickedness is increasing, for the devil has great dominion over the hearts of the children of men. The Lord is trying to direct and dictate his Saints and I feelthat it is our duty, as a people, to unite our interests together, also our time, tal-ents, labor, and all that we are stewards over, that, as men who have faith in God, we may be prepared for those things which await us, and for the coming of the Son of Man. We are observing the signsof the times, and we can readily under-stand the necessity of entering into this order. I think we can all see this if weenjoy any portion of the spirit of our reli-gion and the work of the Lord, which we profess to be engaged in. I can see every-thing in favor but nothing against the United Order. These teachings are of the Lord; the servants of God have been moved to call upon the people, and the Lord has moved upon the people, and their hearts are being touched by the light of the Holy Spirit, and they are en-tering into this organization; and my feel-ing is that if you and I, who profess to be the friends of God, and have entered into a covenant with him, withdraw our heartsfrom him that we do not see the necessityof uniting ourselves according to this law of God, we shall begin to dry up, and what little life, light, or spirit we have will leave us and we shall go down and weshall not walk in the light of the Lord. I view it as a day of decision to the Lat-ter-day Saints throughout the whole Church and kingdom of God, and we shall find itto our advantage to decide rightly, and towalk in the path marked out for us by theservants of the Lord.I feel to say God bless the Latter-daySaints and the honest in heart and meek of the earth throughout the whole world,and I pray that the nations may be pre-pared for that which is to come, for as God lives there is a change at the door, andwhat the ancient patriarchs and prophetssaid will be fulfilled; and if I were to ex-press my feelings as the spirit reveals tome it would be a good deal as Daniel said, that all who will not prepare themselves for the coming of Christ must get out of the way, for the little stone that was cut out of the mountains without hands will shortly grind them to powder, and they will be cast away as the chaff of the sum-mer threshing floor. [##Daniel 2:35##] The kingdom ofGod, which Daniel saw, the Zion of God in embryo, is on the earth, and is here in these mountains; and it will rise and rise, until it is clothed with the glory of God.May God help us to prepare for hiscoming and kingdom, for Christ's sake.Amen. 
 THE SALT LAKE TIMESLAST EDITIONN SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 1891. VOL 5. NO. 228.HEADS OF THE CHURCHInterview with President Woodruff andPresident Cannon on the PresentPolitical Situation in UtahABSOLUTE GOOD FAITH PREVAILS.The Leaders of the Church, in Unequivocal Terms, DeclareThat There is No Desire to Re-Estab-lish Old Conditions.Polygamy is a Dead Issue-The Church Will Not Attempt to Exer-cise Any Control Over Its Members in Political Matters-The Present Status of Affairs.The only arguement put forward inopposition to the organization of par-ties on national lines in Utah is thatpeople's party is not sincere inthe dissolution that has been effectedand that a plot has been laid by whichthe liberals are to be divided and thepolitical control of Utah placed in thehands of the mormon people for pur-poses adverse to the interests of thegentile element. It has been urgedthat the movement, so far as the mor-mons are concerned, is being engi-neered by the church; and the demandhas been made that the heads of thechurch should define their position inconnection with the subject before thegentiles should be asked to believe thatthe members of the organization aresincere.In brief, it has been claimed that itis the purpose of the church to securestatehood for Utah, and through thealleged political control of itsmembers, seize all the officesand carry on the government inthe interest of mormons andagainst the interests of non-mormons.It is held that the church claims theright to exercise absolute authorityover its members in all matters andthat this extends to direct dictation asto whom they should vote for at alltimes. We are told that those whohave joined the democratic and repub-lican parties have done so at the direc-tion of the head of the church, that thepeople's party was dissolved at theirdictation and its members will besubject at all times in the future totheir absolute control. We are toldfurther that polygamy has simply beensuspended, to be re-establised in thefuture under the protection of statelaws enacted by mormon legislatures;and that these legislatures, elected bythe decree of the church, will passother laws intededto oppress gentilesand work virtual confication of theirproperty.There are thousands of earnest gen-tiles who do not believe one word ofthe charges of bad faith that areput forward in connection with thismatter, but there are others whoare frightened by the pictures paintedbefore their imaginations and who arehonestly looking for further evidencesof good faith on the part of the mor-mons before joining the present move-ment. The entire controversy turnsupon this question of good faith, as wasshown by the organ of the extremistswhen it declared in its issue of June12th that it would yield to party di-vision if any evidence could be adducedthat would be received in a court oflaw that the dissolution of the people'sparty was sincere.THE TIMES has held that the evidenceof sincerity on the part of the mormonsis abundant and satisfactory, but it hasdesired to satisfy all sincere doubters,and for that reason it determined ifpossible to secure expressions fromPresident Woodruff and PresidentGeorge Q. Cannon upon the disputedpoint. Such expressions have been se-cured. They appear in connectionherewith and they must clear away thelast vestige of doubt from the mind ofevery man who is willing to yield toincontrovertible evidence.It is not often that these highest dig-nitaries of the church consent to under-go the modern process of interviewing,but when THE TIMES conveyed its de-sire to them and represented the publicimportance of the subject which itwished to cover, they consented to re-ceive its representative. When the lat-ter called at church headquarters incompany with a gentleman who hadconsented to introduce him, PresidentCannon stepped into the receptionroom to greet his visitors. The news-paper man was invited to take a seat inthe office and state his business. Pres-ident Woodruff was absent at that time,but President Cannon suggested thatthe points which it was desired to covermight be put in the form of interroga-tories which could be taken up andanwered in detail. This was done andthe questions which appear in the fol-lowing interview were propounded. Thefirst counselor expressed his personalopinion that there was no reason whythe queries could not all be answeredand undertook to lay them before pres-ident Woodruff when that gentlemanshould be able to again appear at theoffice. The talk at the time ran on forhalf an hour and THE TIMES represen-tative was impressed by the manifestearnestness and sincerity of PresidentCannon. It was evident that he wasdeepely interested in securing the estab-lishment of conditions that would for-ever remove his church from the con-tentions of politics and wouldleave its people free to ally them-selves with the national parti[es.]He told the story of the agitation withinthe church that led up to the renuncia-tion of polygamy, and it was made ap-parent that that renunciation couldnot be otherwise than absolute and final.President Cannon promised to havethe matter taken up at the earliest pos-sible moment and to notify THE TIMESwhen the answers to the questionsshould be ready.The queries were laid before Presi-dent Woodruff and he and PresidentCannon jointly give THE TIMES thefollowing as their deliberated expressedviews on every question touched upon:"It was asserted that the people's partywas dissolved by direction of thechurch. Is there any foundation forthat charge?""The people's party was dissoved, aswe understand, by the action of itsleading members. They have stated tous their convictions that the time hadcome for a division on national partylines. There has been a growing feel-ing in this directions for a long time,and the dissolution of the people's partyis the result of that sentiment, and notthe fiat or instruction of the church. Thefirst intimation we had of dividing onparty lines came to us from Ogden.There is, therefore, no foundation forthe charge that the church broughtabout the dissolution of the people'sparty.""Does the church claim the right to dictate to its members in politicalmatters?""The church does not claim any suchright.""THE TIMES has held that the ap-pearance of church management of thepeople's party during recent times re-sulted purely from the fact that the party was composed almost entirely of members of the church with prominent churchmen taking part in its affairs, and that there has not been churchrule as charged. Is this view correct?""THE TIMES has correctly stated thefacts connected with the appearance ofchurch management of the people'sparty. That party having been com-posed principally of members of thechurch, and self defense having com-pelled them to consult together and todecided concerning the best steps to betaken to preserve their rights, somecolor has been given to the charge thatit was a church party. But this has notbeen done in a church capacity. Menhave had influence in that party and been listened to according to their ex-perience, and not because of theirofficial position in the church.""That being true, are we to under-stand that the church will not assertany right to control the poitical actionof its members in the future?""This is what we wish to convey andhave you understand. As officers ofthe church we disclaim the right tocontrol the political actions of the mem-bers of our body.""Will there be any reson why mem-bers of the church should come to-gether and vote solidly, if political con-ditions here are similar to those which prevail elsewhere?""We cannot perceive any reasonwhy they should do this in the future,if, as you say, political conditions shouldexist here as they prevail elsewhere.""Would leaders of the church counselthe support of church members, irre-spective of party affiliations?""It is not probable that the leadersof the church would give any counselupon such subjects, and certainlywould not discriminate against equallysuitable men because they were notmembers of the church. We would bein favor of voting for suitable men,regardless of their religious beliefs orassociations.""Do you understand that those who join the republican and democraticparties will vote and work for gentilecandidates of those parties as freelyas for Mormon candidates?""This is clearly our understand-ing, and we fully expect that formermembers of the people's party whojoin the two national parties will betrue to their party convictions andsustain the nominees of their respec-tive parties, though they may not bemembers of the mormon church.""Is it your intention to advise mem-bers of the mormon church, when thepeople's party members have dividedand after the liberal party has beenbroken up, to unite in favor of themormon church and against the gen-tiles? Do you know of any intentionor understanding on the part of theheads of the church to advise the mem-bers of the church, if statehood shouldbe obtained, to unite and co-operate inrespect to the interests of the churchagainst the gentiles?""We have refrained from interferingin political matters because our posi-tion, we ourselves not having a vote.But we would consider it the height offolly, even if we had a disposition to di-rect the members of our church uponpolitical matters, to adivse them tounite in favor of our church and againstthe non-members thereof, if the presentpolitcal movement should continue.We see no good reason, if the liberalparty should break up, for any suchdivision as has heretofore exited be-tween mormons and non-mormons. Wehave deplored the existence of this classfeeling, and believe it has been a fruit-ful source of trouble. We shall hailwith unfeigned gratification the timewhen the people of Utah, without re-gard to their religious views, can unitedas citizens and labor for the advance-ment and prosperity fo the territory.If statehood should ever be obtained,all the influence we could use to breakdown the distinctions which have cre-ated such bitterness in the past wouldbe exerted.""Do you believe that if Utah shouldbe admitted as a state the mormons willunite in electing members of the churchto the legislature, and that the legisla-ture will make any laws favorable to themormons and unfavorable to the non-mormons?""As we have already intimated, what-ever influence we can use will be exert-ed in favor of legislation that will be inthe interests and for the benefits of thewhole people. It would be most un-fortunate if any attempt were made topass laws favorable to mormons and unfavorable to non-mormons. Anysuch attempt would be sure to bringupon the mormon people evils whichthey are desirious of averting. It is toour interest to furnish no pretext forthe formation of an anti-mormon party,which would no doubt be the result ifmembers of the church in the legisla-ture were to attempt to discriminate bylegislation in favor of their co-religioni-ists.""Is it your understanding that thepeople's party has honestly and in goodfaith dissolved, and that they will unitewith the democratic and republicanparties according to their convictions ofwhat is right?""This is certainly is our understanding.We can perceive no reason why therepresentatives of the people's partyshould have taken their recent actionunless it was their honest intention tounite themselves with the national parties.""Do you know of any intention onthe part of the church or any of its offi-cers or members every to organize a political party with respect to the con-ceived interests of the mormonchurch?""We know of no such intention onthe part of anyone, and can see no ob-ject to be attained, under the new con-ditions which now surround us, by or-ganizing any such party.""Do you undersand that it is thewish of the mormon church to maintaina separation of church and state withrespect to all political quesions?""However much appearances mayhave indicated that we have favored theunion of church and state, and not-withstanding the many assertions whichhave been made of this nature, there isno real disposition among the peopleof our church to unite church and state;in fact, we believe there should be aseparation between the two. But inpast times the situation if this territorywas such that officers of the churchwere frequently elected to civil office.If the people availed themselves of thebest talent of the community they wereunder the necessity very frequently ofselecting officers of the church to fillthese positions. You must understandthat nearly every reputable malemember of the mormon church holdsoffice in the church. Of course, wherethe people, as was the case in manylocalities, were all mormons, if theyelected any of their own members theyhad to choose men who help position in the church. Men were selected forbishops because of their superior abilityto care and manage the affairs oftheir wards. They were the practical andexperienced men of their sever com-munties, and in the estimation of thepeople were suitable for legislators, etc.Their election to civil offices led to theidea that was a union of church and state.""Do you believe that it is the wish ofthe mormon people to unite with thegreat national parties and conductpolitics in this territory as they areconducted in all other states?""That is the impression we have re-ceived from conversation with menamong us who take the greatest inter-est in political matter.""Is there any reason why the mem-bers of the church should not act freelywith the national parties at all times?""We know of no reason why theyshould not.""Would the leaders of the church,under any circumstances, countenacedefiance of the laws against polygamy?""Speaking for ourselves, in view ofthe experiences of the past, 'No, theywould not.' ""Would leaders of the church, ifplaced in official position, wink at vio-lations of the anti-polyamy laws?""We cannot say what others mightdo, but for ourselves we say, 'We would not wink at violations of the law.' ""Would there be any desire amongchurch leaders to abolish the lawsagainst polygamy or to make them lessstringent if Utah were admitted to statehood?""You may rest assured that churchleaders would neither attempt them-selves, nor advise others to attempt, toabolish those laws, if Utah were to be-come a state.""Is it your understanding that if amember of the mormon church, sincethe issuance of the manifesto and itsadoption by the church should enterinto polygamy he would thereby violatethe creed of the church, and would itbe wrong for him to do so?""We ought to state to you that wehave no creed.  We have what arecalled the articles of faith, amongwhich, however, there is nothing saidconcerning polygamy. A member ofthe church who should now enter intothat relation would violate the rule ofthe church, and he would considereda wrong-doer.""Would you or any officer of thechurch authorize a polygamous mar-riage or countenace the practice ofunlawful cohabitation?""Again we have to say we can onlyspeak for ourselves, and say that wewould not authorize any such marriageor practice violative of the law.""Is it your understanding that themormon people are in good faith ob-serving the laws of the United Statesprohibiting polygamy and unlawfulcohabitation?""That is our understanding.""Is there any foundation for thecharge that the mormon leaders arenow engaged in a political conspiracyto secure political power for thechurch?""There is not the least ground forany such statement. We are not en-gaged any conspiracy of this char-acter.""Is there anything to be gained forthe church by securing political controlin Utah with or without statehood?""We see nothing to be gained for thechurch in this way.""Is it not true that the member andleaders of the church desire to place itin a position in the community like thatoccupied by other church societies?""The only protections the church de-sires is that which it should obtain un-der general laws which secure the rightsof all demonations. It would be mostunwise for the mormon people to en-deavor to secure any advantage notshared in by other religious people. Allthat we ask is to have equal rights be-fore the law.""Is it your understanding that themormon people differ as to republi-can and democratic parties, and thatthey will act in accordance with theirconvictions in uniting with thoseparties?""That is our understanding.""Is it your wish that the republicanand democratic parties should organizeand present their principle to the mor-mon people, and that they should unitewith them according to their honestconvictions?""Personally, we have felt that thetime would come when the two greatparties would be organized in this ter-ritory, and we have felt that if an at-tempt  of this kind should be made, eachshould have the fullest opportunity tolay its principles before the people, sothat they might have a clear under-standing of the issues and be able todecide, in the light of facts presentedto them, to which of parties theywould belong.""That being true, could anything begained by bad faith even if it shouldbe contemplated by any of the formermembers of peoples' party?""Certainly not.""The opponents of party division onnational lines declare that they wantevidence of the sincerity of the mormonpeople. THE TIMES would ask you tostate whether the declaration of sin-cerity on the part of those leaders whohve been before the public relfect yourviews and meet with your approval.""Those declarations express ourviews and have our entire approval.What greater evidence can be askedthat those which have already beenfurnished? The statement has beenrepeatedly made that the great objec-tion to us was our belief and practiceof patriarchal marrige. In entiregood faith the manifesto was written,signed by the leading men, and adopted by one of the largest general confer-ences of the church ever held--a con-ference composed of about 15,000 people. It has been asserted, in addition,that the people were governed by thepriesthood in political matters. This isnow disproved by the dissolution of thepeople's party and the union of itsmembers with the two national parties.What could possibly be gained by theaction of the people if they were notsincere? If the elements of sinceritywere wanting, such a movement wouldresult in entire demoralization." 
 DISCOURSEBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVEREDAt the Semi-Annual Conference ofthe Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, in the NewTabernacle, Salt Lake City, Wed-day, October 7th, 1874.REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.I DID not have the privilege of listening to all the remarks of Elder Taylor this fore-noon, yet to what I did hear I can bear tes-timony of its truth. I always delight in seeing a man valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ. There is something glorious in the principles of the Gospel. I always did, from my boyhood, hope and pray that I might live long enough in the earthto find some man who would have suffi-cient courage and independence of mindto believe in the same doctrine and gospel that Jesus Christ taught, and I have lived long enough to see, hear and partake of it, and I glory in it, because it is true.The religion or Gospel of Jesus Christ isa very unpopular thing, and has been inevery age of the world. Show me a manwho was ever inspired of the Lord God ofIsrael to do a work for him who was popu-lar. You can not find such a man in thewhole history of the world. You may take Noah, who was about a hundred andtwenty years building an ark, and how many friends did he have? I think about eight in all. [##Genesis 7:7##] Lot was very unpopular themorning he left Sodom and Gomorrah,and so have been all the patriarchs andprophets in every age of the world. [##Genesis 19:1-17##] Je-sus Christ, when he came to Jerusalem,the Son of God, the Savior of the world,the great Shiloh of the Jews, came to his own father's house, yet there was not a man more despised in all Judea and Jeru-salem than was Jesus Christ, from the day of his birth until he came to the cross. [##Matthew 13:54-58##]Why is this? Because men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds areevil. The Lord Almighty, in the last days, has set his hand to carry out and fulfill his words for the past five or six thousand years, given through the mouths of his servants the prophets and apostles whenever he has had them on the earth. He has commenced this work and be will perform it, for, as Brother Taylorhas justly said, there is no power on the earth that can stay his hand, for the sim-ple reason that God controls the destiniesof all men—kings, princes, rulers, presi-dents, statesmen, governors, nations, tongues and people, upon the face of the whole earth, and men are placed in a posi-tion where they are under the necessity of exercising faith in God in order to build up his kingdom. Read the eleventh chap-ter of Hebrews and you will find that, be-ginning with the creation of the world,everything has been accomplished by faith. The whole of the work of all the ancient patriarchs and prophets was accomplishedby the exercise of this principle; and it is just so in the last dispensation of the ful-ness of times, when God sent angels to Joseph Smith. He knew and understood,by the teachings given unto him, what hehad to perform in a measure. The Lord called him to do a work, and raised himup for this purpose. Was Joseph Smithpopular among men? No, never, he waspersecuted until the day of his death, un-til he sealed his testimony with his blood.But the persecution against him, and the unbelief of the world, do not make the truth of God without effect. The Lord has carried out and fulfilled all these pro-phecies from the commencement untilnow; there never has been a jot or tittleallowed to fall unfulfilled, there never wasa revelation, from the days of FatherAdam until this, given by the inspirationof the Holy Ghost through the mouth ofpatriarch or prophet that will fall unful-filled. Though the heavens and the earth pass away, these things will not fail of their fulfillment, and, as Brother Taylorhas said, the world cannot stay the workof God. They never have doneand they never will.This is a different dispensation from all others. God has set to his hand to buildup his kingdom and Zion, and that king-dom and Zion must be built up, or the revelations of God will fall unfulfilled. The Bible is full of these teachings, andthey must have their fulfillment, and Ibear testimony to their truth. The Bibleis true, and its prophecies were spoken byholy men of old as they were moved uponby the Holy Ghost. The revelations of Isaiah concerning the building up of theZion of God in the last days will have their fulfillment. The House of God will be established upon the tops of the moun-tains, and all nations must flow unto it. Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments, she must be clothed with the glory of her God. The temple of God has got to be built also upon the tops of the mountains; the gospel must be preached to every nation under heaven before the end shall come.The world say they do not believe thesethings; that is true, we do not expect them, we never have expected them to be-lieve them, but the unbelief of the worlddoes not change the work of God. We have to live by faith. When Moroni hid in the earth, the record which the Book of Mormon was translated from, four hun-dred years after Christ came in the flesh,he did it by faith, as much so as Noah built the ark. He looked forward and saw that record come forth in the last days, in fulfillment of the sayings of Eze-kiel and of the saying of Isaiah, when thestick of Joseph should be put with the stick of Judah, and they should becomeone stick in the hands of the servants of the Lord before the eyes of the world, andwhen the truth should spring out of theearth and righteousness look down fromheaven. These things were to be a begin-ning of the great work of God preparatoryto the gathering of the twelve tribes of Israel in the latter days. That work has come forth, just as everything has beenfulfilled which has been done by faith andby the commandment of God.When Joseph Smith began to receiverevelations from God he was a boy, an il-literate youth; and had he not had faithand the inspiration of the Almighty uponhim, he never could have had power andcourage to go forth and introduce the gos-pel of Jesus Christ in the midst of a gen-eration of false doctrine, ignorance anddarkness. But God preserved, inspiredand sustained him, and caused him to liveupon the earth until he had planted thiskingdom, in fulfillment of the revelations.He organized the Church, he received theholy priesthood from the hands of angelssent from God—men who had held theAaronic and Melchizedek priesthood inother generations upon the earth; they conferred upon Joseph all the powers andkeys of the Priesthood necessary to buildup the kingdom of God upon the earth, and he lived long enough to organize that kingdom, and it will never be throwndown any more for ever.The revelations of God to us have been encouraging, and we have seen them ful-filled, and we shall continue to do so until the end. I will say to the Latter-day Saints, that we are in the same positionthat other generations have been—we havegot to walk by faith, we must have confi-dence in the fulfillment of the revelations of God. No man or woman on the face of the earth will ever be disappointed with regard to the fulfillment of the word of the Lord, for he has uttered decrees, made covenants and through his servants theprophets has declared his word and will concerning the world and its inhabitants, and not one of his sayings will fail, all must be fulfilled. If it could be other-wise, the Zion of God would never be built up, but God has decreed that his king-dom will be established, that Zion willarise and shine, and that every weapon formed against her will be broken.The prayers of hundreds and thousands of Saints, dwelling in these valleys of the mountains, daily ascend into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, beseeching him to fulfill his word upon the earth and to sus-tain his servants. Do not the Saints prayfor anybody else? Yes, they pray for ever[y]body—for President Ulysses S. Grant|Grant, JudgeMcKean, the Governor of Utah, and every man holding official positions here as wellas for Brigham Young and the Apostles.These prayers ascend before the Lord and they will be heard and answered.Talk about Brigham Young and Joseph Smith, how many have said to Joseph Smith—"How, on the earth do you govern and control this people? How easy you do it!" Our enemies, to-day, look at Brigham Young, and they say—"If he would only die Mormonism would stop;" but in this they are mistaken. This work does not depend upon President Young; it did not depend upon Joseph Smith. All the world thought if they could only slay Joseph Smith there would be an end of Mormonism, and so there would have been had it not been the work of God Al-mighty; if it had been the work of manit would long since have ceased to exist onthe earth. The power that has sustained this work from the beginning sustains it now. As Brother Taylor has said, all theholy prophets and apostles who have beenslain on the earth for the testimony of Je-sus and the word of God, and who nowsit on the right hand of God in the heav-ens, are just as much engaged in carryingon the work of God here as when they lived in the flesh, and more so, becausethey have more light and power. AndJesus Christ, himself, who died on thecross, and after his resurrection visited theother sheep of his fold on this continent, and offered the Gospel to Jew and Gentile,that same Jesus is pleading with the Fatherto day, and has been from the day hisbody lay in the tomb, to carry out and ful-fill his purposes and to accomplish hiswork in our day and generation. We are not alone in our efforts to carry on the work of God. If the eyes of the world were open they would see that there aremore for us than against us. We are only, in one sense of the word, worms of the dust in the hands of God. This work does not depend on any man or set of men. The Lord Almighty has set his hand to accomplish his purposes, and he is feeling after the honest and meek throughout the world, in order to find those who are willing to take hold and help to build up his kingdom in the latter days. He has found a few, and he will find many more.How has it been with Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, the apostles, and thou-sands of the Elders of Israel who have gone forth to preach the gospel to the world without purse or script, offering the word of life and salvation without money and without price? They have carried their knapsacks on their backs, or with va-lise in hand have travelled thousands and thousands of miles for this purpose. They have been inspired to do this by the power of the Most High God, and that inspiration has sustained them all the way through; it has upheld this churchfrom the time it came forth until this hour,and will unto its consummation. We came in here on the 24th of July, 1847, having been driven from our homes, thegraves of our fathers, and from lands we purchased from the General Governmentbecause of the word of God and the tes-timony of Jesus Christ, or, in other words, because of our religion. We came hereand found a barren desert, containingnothing but a few roving Indians, coyotewolves, crickets and grasshoppers. Therewas no mark of the Anglo Saxon race orof the white man here then, but the wholeregion of country was a desert of the mostforbidding and desolate character. Now when strangers come up to Zion on this great highway, east up in fulfillment of the revelations of God, what do they see? They see no longer a desert, but a belt, for six hundred miles, of cities, towns, vil-lages, orchards, fields and crops. Who has done this? The Lord God of Israel has inspired his Saints to do it. President Young has been led, guided, counseled and moved upon by the Holy Ghost and by the revelations of Jesus Christ, and that which strangers now behold in this tabernacle, and throughout this Territory is in fulfillment of that volume of revela-tion which you can read in the prophe-cies of Isaiah and others of the prophetsand patriarchs. These things are true andyour eyes can see them, whether you be-lieve them or not has nothing to do with it. I will tell you that if this work had not been of God, and God had not bornetestimony to the preaching of the elders,we might have preached until we had beenas old as Methuselah and we could not have gathered the people from almostevery nation under heaven as we have done,according to the predictions of the ancient prophets contained in the Bible. But theLord has never disappointed anybody sofar as his work is concerned. It did notstop after the death of Joseph, and it never will on account of the death of any man, prophet, apostle or any other man,for it is in the hands of God, and he has decreed that it shall stand for ever, and that it shall extend until its dominion be-comes universal.We do not see to-day what we saw twenty-four years ago, and we do not see to-day what will be seen twenty-four years hence; there will be no stoppage to the building up of the Zion of God, or to the carrying out of his work. Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, raised up by the Lord Almighty, and the inspiration of God guided and sustained him to the day of his death. He sealed his testimony with his blood, and that testimony is in force upon all the world. This record which I hold in my hands (Book of Doctrine and Covenants) contains the revelations of God, and in one of them the Lord says—"Let earth and hell combine against you, and they shall not prevail, the kingdom is yours, I have given it into your hands, andyou are called upon to build it up." [##Doctrine and Covenants 6:34##] The Lord is at the helm to govern, guide and control this work, and he will do so unto the end.Now when men undertake to fight against this work, as Brother Taylor hassaid, they fight against God; it is not against Brigham Young, the apostles or this people alone, but it is against God. Every man will be rewarded according to his works. Our prayers go up before God day and night, that he will execute jus-tice, judgement, righteousness and truth,that he will sustain everything that leadsto good, and does good, and that he willoverthrow all that leads to evil and do evil; and we are assured by revelation thatthe Lord will hear and answer our prayers.The Lord is with this people; but as Lat-ter-day Saints, I do not think that we al-ways prize our privileges. We are called upon to perform a work; the Lord has placed this work in our hands, and we areheld responsible before the heavens andthe earth to use the talents—the light andtruth, which have been committed into ourhands.What is this life? What are the thingsof this life? The Latter-day saints are living for things the other side of the vail, the same as all servants of God havedone in every age of the world. Now is it not a curiosity that so few of the humanfamily have an interest in eternal things,things the other side of the vail? Bless your souls, our lives here are only a fewdays in duration, but on the other side ofthe vail we shall live eternally, we shall live and exist just as long as our Creatorwill exist, and our eternal destiny dependsupon the manner in which we spend ourshort lives here in the flesh. Wall it not pay any man, any prophet, apostle or Saint, in this or any other age of the world, to be true and faithful to his God,to magnify his calling, to be valiant in thetestimony of Jesus Christ, to preach thegospel, to bear record of the things of the kingdom to Jew and Gentile in his dayand generation? Yes, it will pay men to do right, and men will sorrow and bitterlyregret taking any course in this or anyother generation against God or his work.What have been the afflictions of the Jewswho rejected Jesus Christ? Why every word spoken concerning them by Mosesand Jesus has had its fulfillment until thepresent day, for hundreds of years pastand gone. They have been a hiss and aby-word, and trodden under the feet of theGentiles, in fulfillment of the words of Jesus Christ, and they will continue intheir present position until the fullness ofthe Gentiles has come in. Jesus offeredhis gospel to the Jews in his day, but inthese latter days it has been offered first tothe Gentiles, thus fulfilling the saying thatthe first shall be last and the last shall befirst; and when the Gentiles count them-selves unworthy of eternal life, the gos-pel will go to the House of Israel andthey will receive it. [##Matthew 20:16##] The Gentiles shouldheed the warning given them by the Apos-tle Paul, lest they fall through the exam-ple of unbelief as did the Jews, who werebroken off because they rejected the Mes-siah, and refused the message of salvationwhich he delivered unto them. From that day to this they have been scattered,peeled and afflicted; their city was over-thrown and their temples destroyed, andthe land of their fathers has been in thehands of Gentile nations until to-day. The Lord has said—"Vengeance is mine and I will repay," and we may rest as-sured that the Lord will reward those who seek to destroy the lives of his people and to overthrow his kingdom. [##Romans 12:19##] Vengeance is in the hands of the Almighty. "I will fight your battles," saith the Lord. [##Exodus 14:14##] We do not seek any man's hurt, however much of an enemy he may be to us, we leave him in the hands of God, we know that he will reward him, and the reward will be all that God, Saints, angels, devils or wicked men can ask, and it will be all that any man can want. When we undertake to fight against God we have to pay for it. Men will have to pay for every sin commit-ted in the flesh; no matter what they do, they will have to be accountable for it. If a man does right, is valiant in the testi-mony of Jesus Christ, obeys the gospel,and keeps his covenants, when he passesto the other side of the vail he has an en-trance into the presence of God and theLamb; having kept celestial law he entersinto celestial glory, he is preserved by thatlaw, and he participates in that glory through the endless ages of eternity. It pays any man under heaven to obey and be faithful to the law of God the few days he spends in the flesh. I say to the world, to every sect under heaven, if you ever obtain any blessings in the eternal worlds from anybody at all it will be from the God the Latter-day Saints worship, for God made us all; whether we are Metho-dists, Baptists, Mormons or anything else we are all the children of one parent. Then why should we persecute one anoth-er because of our religion? It is folly in the highest degree. We live in a land and under a constitution which guarantees the right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience to every sect, party, name and denomination under heaven, then why should we be so narrow-minded as to hate or seek to persecute or kill our neighbor because he differs from us in re-ligion?We worship God and we are Latter-day Saints because we know that the gospelwhich has been revealed in these latterdays is true. We have received it and have realized the promises made to thosewho would obey it. The Holy Ghost and the testimony of Jesus Christ never de-ceived us, and we have received that testi-mony while a broad in almost every nationunder heaven. By this power we have been gathered. That is the reason we are Mormons, as the world call us. We know this work is true, we know it is the gospel of Jesus Christ. We would not persecute, abuse, or quarrel with any manbecause of his religious views. A man's religion, let it be what it will, is between him and his God. He is going to the eter-nal world, and he will receive his reward,and there is no reason or use in quarrel-ing about religion, and we have never feltto do this in our lives. Whatever mayhave been said concerning us, our taberna-cles—this and others—have been open to every minister who came along, no matter to what sect or party he belonged. We are not afraid of our doctrines, and we are not afraid to have our children hear the doctrines of others. If any man has got a truth that we have not got, let us have it. Truth is what we are after, and we are not afraid of the doctrines of any man,we are willing to stand by the revelations of God. These are the feelings of the Lat-ter-day Saints. When our Methodist friends came to this city, erected their tent and held their big camp meeting, what was the course pursued by the Latter-day Saints? The President of the church, the Twelve Apostles and citizens with their wives and children gave them a congrega-tion of many thousands, and we sat intheir tent and listened to them while theyabused us just as much as they pleased. We believe in giving every man the privi-lege of saying what he pleases, we have always been willing to let every man ex-press his sentiments here among us. Weare not afraid of them. If we have not the truth, that is what we are after, we want it. But we know that we have it, that the gospel as restored, revealed throughJoseph Smith, is the truth of God, and we know that the Lord has set to his hand to build up Zion, and he is going to do it. We bear record of this because we know it is true.I pray that God will bless the Latter-day Saints. I pray that we may prize our privileges, that we may enjoy the spirit of our calling, and that the Holy Ghost may enlighten our minds continually, that we may not walk in the dark but in the light. I pray that the Spirit of God may bear re-cord to the stranger within our gates. Iam satisfied that it does, and it has done more or less for the forty years that are past and gone. But it is the same to-day as it was in the days of Jesus. He told Nicodemus that light had come into the world, but men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil, and here is where condemnation comes in, but we can not help that. [##John 3:19##] My brethren and I have traveled a great many thou-sands of miles to preach the Gospel to our fellow-men; we have done this because we know this Gospel is true. We are willing to stand by this Gospel, this testimony and this work in life and in death, in time and in eternity. We shall meet the stran-gers who come here and visit us, on the other side of the vail; they will meet us there, and if they never know before, theywill know then that our testimony is true.I pray God our heavenly Father that hewill bear testimony by his Holy Spirit to the meek and honest among the children of men, that they may receive the truthand be prepared to inherit eternal life, forJesus' sake. Amen. 
 DISCOURSEBy Elder W. WOODRUFF, De-livered at the General Confer-ence, in the New Tabernacle, SaltLake City, April 7th, 1873.REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.ONE of the proverbs common among the Saints of God in the dis-pensation in which we live—thedispensation of the fullness of times, is, "The Kingdom of God or noth-ing." President Young has beentrying to get us to labor to build upthe kingdom of God. This king-dom has been given into the handsof the Latter-day Saints to establishon the earth, and unless we laborfor its advancement we shall cer-tainly fall short of salvation,for all the salvation there is, whether for Jew, Gentile, Saint or sinner, isin connection with this kingdom.We have had a great many plaintruths presented before this Confer-ence, and if we will observe thecounsels that have been given weshall be led to salvation. Everyone of the prepositions made byPresident Young has this tendency.It is our duty as Latter-day Saintsto sustain the Zion of God on theearth. What he has said to us istrue. We have heard it thousandsof times. We have been counselledfor many years to try to lay a foun-dation for our own independencein these mountains. It is a wellknown principle in political econo-my that any nation or people thatexpend more than they produce,or buy from other nations morethan they sell in return, will growpoor. We should produce what weuse—what we eat and wear, and asfor what we drink, why the moun-tain streams supply that of thepurest quality.There are several items to whichI would like to call your attention.President Young has taken thelead in establishing woollen facto-ries in this Territory. Others haveassisted in this work, but he hasdone much more than any otherman, and now we have several goodmills for the manufacture of clothand other fabrics owned and run bythe Saints in Utah. Still we sendmany large quantities of woolabroad instead of using it in ourown mills, and import goods of out-side manufacture instead of makingthem at home. How long will it be before we are poor, and our Ter-ritory drained of all the money wecan raise, if we continue this? We should not send our wool to be manufactured in the States, and then pay our money for cloth brought from there here.Where are our wool growers? What are they thinking about whenthey do this? This is an itemwhich I consider of vital import-ance to the Latter-day Saints. Weshould keep our wool at home, and we should manufacture this woolinto cloth, and we should buy andpay for that cloth and supporthome manufactures. This is a principle which we have neglected in a great degree; but we have gotto come to it sometime.  We havegot either to make ourselves self-sus-taining, or we shall have to go with-out a good many things that we nowregard as almost indispensable forour welfare and comfort, for there isnot a man who believes in the reve-lations of God but what believes theday is at hand when there will betrouble among the nations of theearth, when great Babylon willcome in remembrance before God,and his judgments will visit thenations. When that day comes, if Zion has food and raiment and the comforts of life she must producethem, and there must be a begin-ning to these things.This is the Zion of God, this isthe work of God. The servants ofGod have borne record and testi-mony to this now for more thanforty years, and the Lord has back-ed up their testimony, fulfilling his word in the events which havetranspired in the earth. The Lordsays, "I am angry with none exceptthose who acknowledge not my hand in all things." [##Doctrine and Covenants 59:21##] As a peoplewe have been obliged to acknow-ledge the hand of God in our salva-tion and guidance. Some of thespeakers have referred to the driv-ings and persecutions of the Saintsin the past. The Lord says, "Of-fences must needs come, but woeto him by whom they come." [##Matthew 18:7##] If we had not been driven from Jack-son, Caldwell and Clay Counties, and from Kirtland and Nauvoo,Utah, to-day, would have been abarren desert, there would havebeen no railroad from the Atlanticto the Pacific, and we should nothave fulfilled, I may say, thous-ands of the revelations of God as we have done. The hand of the Lord has been manifest in all thesematters. He has watched thispeople, and over this work from itsfoundation until to-day, and hewill continue to do so. But it iscertainly true that, as a people, wemust heed the counsels of the Lord through his servants, for thesecounsels, if observed will secure ussalvation, and lead us to prosperity, union and happiness.President Young, as an instru-ment in the hands of God, has brought his tens of thousands fromthe old world, who never wereworth, I may say, a farthing, whonever owned a horse, carriage, wagon, cow, pig or chicken, andhardly had bread enough to keep soul and body together. There arethousands upon thousands now inthese valleys of the mountains who were brought here by the donations of the Saints of God, and the mer-cies of God unto them. They are now settled through this valley forsix hundred miles. They have enough to eat, drink and wear,houses and lands of their own, andplenty of this world's goods to make them comfortable.Everything that leads to good and to do good is of God, and eve-rything that leads to evil and to do evil is of the wicked one. [##Moroni 7:12##] I will ask, Has not good grown out of thewhole work of God from the or-ganization of this Church until to-day? Has not this gospel been of-fered for more than forty years tothe nations of the earth, in its plainness, truth and simplicity, asit was anciently by Jesus and his Apostles? It has, and thousandswho are in this Territory to-day can bear testimony to its truth.The example is before the world.Zion is like a city set on a hill thatcannot be hid. She is a beacon to the nations of the earth. The Saints of God are fulfilling therevelations of God; they are fulfill-ing the prophecies and sayings ofthe ancient patriarchs and prophets, who spoke as they were movedupon by the Holy Ghost, and noprophecy is of private interpreta-tion. If those holy men of God spoke the word of God, whatthey said will have its fulfillment, and no power can stay this work.The set time has come for theLord to establish his kingdom of which Daniel spoke, that Zion which Isaiah saw and portrayed, and about which he and many other prophets have left so manysayings in their prophecies. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] [##Isaiah 60##] Thehistory of the progress of this churchis before the world. It is the work of God, and not a saying ever madeabout it by an inspired man,whether in the Bible, Book of Mor-mon, or in the Doctrine and Cove-nants, will fail of its fulfillment.No matter whether these wordscame by the voice of God out of theheavens, by the ministration of angels, or by the voice of the ser-vants of God in the flesh, it is thesame; although the heavens andthe earth may pass away, they willnot go unfulfilled.This is the foundation upon which the Latter-day Saints labor, andupon which they have labored from the beginning of this church.Joseph Smith has often been termed an illiterate, unlearned man. He was a farmer's son, and had verysmall chance of education. Whatprimer had he to reveal the fullnessof the gospel to the world? Noneat all, only as he was taught by theadministration of angels from hea-ven, by the voice of God and by theinspiration and power of the HolyGhost. The principles which havebeen revealed to the world throughhim are true as the throne of God. Their influence is already felt in the earth, and will continue to in-crease until the coming of the Sonof man; and the blood of the pro-phets which has been shed in testi-mony thereof will remain in forceupon all the world, until the sceneis wound up.What other people on the face ofthe earth are preparing for JesusChrist? The Lord Jesus Christ iscoming to reign on earth. Theworld may say that he delays his coming until the end of the earth.But they know neither thethoughts nor the ways of the Lord.The Lord will not delay his com-ing because of their unbelief, andthe signs both in heaven and earthindicate that it is near. The figtrees are leafing in sight of all the nations of the earth, and if they had the Spirit of God they could see and understand them.The Latter-day Saints can notstand still; we can not becomestereotyped. God has decreed thathis Zion must progress. We can not remain in one groove orposition. This Kingdom has con-inued to progress frown the begin-ning, and the little one is nowmore than a thousand, and it will hasten to become a strong nation, forit is God's work, and its destiny isin his hands. It becomes us, as Latter-day Saints, to realize thesethings as they are, and also ourposition and calling before God.We must build up the Zion and kingdom of God on the earth, or fail in the object of our calling andreceiving the priesthood of God in these latter days. The full set timehas come, which the Lord decreedbefore the foundation of the world,—the great dispensation of the last days, and a people must be preparedfor the coming of the Son of Man. How can they do it? By beinggathered out from Babylon. Howoften has the question been asked, "Why can not the Latter-day Saints live abroad in the world and enjoy their religion?" We canhardly enjoy it as we are to-day—gathered together, the wicked willfollow us up; and then we are over-whelmed like a mountain with tra-dition. But  we have gathered to-gether that we may be taught byprophets, patriarchs and inspiredmen, and we are endeavoring undertheir instructions, to throw off thetrammels with which we and our forefathers have been bound forgenerations. We are not preparedfor the coming of the Son of Man, and if he were to come today wecould not endure it. There is no people on the earth prepared for that. But the Lord is laboringwith us, he has carried us through a school of experience now for fortyyears, and we should certainly havebeen dull scholars if we had not learned some wisdom.  The Lordintends that we shall unite our-selves together, and in building upthe Zion of God, if we can not at-tain to all that is required of us to-day, we will do what we can, andprogress as fast as we can, that the way may be prepared for the ful-fillment of the words of the Lord.Here is the Bible, the record ofthe Jews, given by the inspirationof the Lord through Moses and theancient patriarchs and prophets.Is it an imposture, and as the in-fidels say, the work of man? No, itis not in the power of any man who ever breathed the breath of life tomake such a book without the in-spiration of the Almighty. It is just so with the Book of Mormon—all the ingenuity of all the menunder heaven could not composeand present to the world a book like the Book of Mormon. Itsprinciples are divine—they are fromGod. They could never emanate from the mind of an impostor, orfrom the mind of a person writing anovel. Why? Because the promi-ses and prophecies it contains are being fulfilled in the sight of all theearth. So with the revelations given through the Prophet JosephSmith contained in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants—they arebeing fulfilled.We, the Latter-day Saints, havethis great almighty work laid uponus, and our hearts should not be setupon the things of the world, for if they are we shall forget God andlose sight of his kingdom. Thecounsels, exhortations and instruc-tions which we receive from theservants of God are just and true. As a people if we will do the willof God we have the power to build up Zion in beauty, power and glory,as the Lord has revealed it through the mouth of the prophet. It restswith us, the Lord working with us. We are called upon to work withthe Lord just as fast as we are pre-pared to receive the things of his kingdom. But I am satisfied therehas got to be a great change withus in many respects before we are prepared for the redemption of Zionand the building up of the NewJerusalem.  I believe the only wayfor us is to get enough of the Spirit of God that we may see and under-stand our duties and comprehendthe will of the Lord.This is a great day, an important time—a time in which great eventsawait the world—Zion, Babylon,Jew, Gentile, saint and sinner, high and low, rich and poor. Great and important events will follow eachother in quick succession before theeyes of this generation.  No genera-tion that ever lived on the earth, lived in a more interesting period than the one in which we live; and when we consider that our eternal destiny depends upon the few shortyears that we spend here, whatmanner of persons ought we to be?Men spend their lives for what they call wealth or happiness, but they seek not after the way of life, andin a few years they lie down anddie and open their eyes in the spiritworld, and they will come forth at some time and be judged according to the deeds done in the body.A great deal has been said withregard to "Mormonism" and the strange people who dwell in thesemountains. Many strangers havecome to visit this city, thinking that their lives were hardly safe be-cause of the horrid stories they had heard about these terrible "Mor-mons," when the fact is, if they hadonly known it, they were a great deal safer here, than in any of the great cities of the world.The Lord has been working, and this people have been working, andthe object of their labor has beenand is to establish the gospel of Jesus Christ and to spread truth and righteousness.  We came here,a few pioneers, on the 24th of July,1847, and we found a desert. Itlooked as though no white mancould live here. We have to ack-nowledge the hand of God in all theblessings we have to-day. ThisTerritory is now filled with cities,towns, villages and gardens. The earth has blossomed like a rose, and the desert has brought forth streams of water from dry places. The Lord has blessed the people, we have to acknowledge his handsin this. This is only a beginning.The world have opposed us fromthe beginning, even very manyhonest-hearted men, ignorant of the nature and object of "Mormonism," have opposed us. If the veil were lifted one minute from the eyes of the world, and they could see thethings of eternity as they are, there is not a man living, not exceptingour friend brother Newman, orPresident Grant, or any other man that breathes, who would not bow down before God and pray for Brigham Young and the prosperity of this work. But there is a vail over men's minds. Darkness coversthe earth and gross darkness theminds of the nations, and this is toprove whether they will or will notwalk in the covenant of the Lord.There are a few who have had suf-ficient independence of mind and stability of character to obey the celestial law. But how few friendsthe Almighty and his servantshave had in this age of the world?As it was in the days of Noah andLot, so it will be in the days of thecoming of the Son of Man. Thenumbers of the servants of God arefew. Let the Lord Almighty senda message to the world now as hedid in the days of Noah, Enoch,Lot, Jesus Christ and the Apostles, and few among the nations of theearth would be willing to receive it.In the days of Jesus the high priests, Sadducees, Essenes, Stoics and every sect and party thenknown in the Jewish nation cried"Crucify him! Crucify him!" Soit was with Joseph Smith. [##Luke 23:21##]From the day that he laid the foun-dation of this work, priest and peo-ple, doctors and lawyers, high andlow, rich and poor, with but few exceptions, have been ready to crush it to the earth. Why? Be-cause, ignorant of its character and mission, they have believed that itinterfered with their religion. Jo-seph Smith had to walk in deep water, he had to row up hill or up stream all the days of his life in order to try and plant the gospel in the midst of the sons of men. A few here and there heard and weredisposed to receive that gospel, and the Spirit of God bore record untothem of its truth, and they wentbefore the Lord and asked him if itwas true, and the Lord revealed itunto them and they embraced it.From that day until the present this message has gone to the world. I have preached it to millions of my fellowmen, so has PresidentYoung, and I may say the same ofhundreds of the elders of this church; and  I do not believe thatever a man, with his ears open, stopped a moment to listen to the testimony of theservants of God about the truth ofthe Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith being a Prophet of God, and therestoration of the fullness of thegospel but what a measure of theSpirit of God has backed up thattestimony to him. When menhave rejected these testimoniesthey have done so against light andtruth, and herein is where condem-nation rests upon this generation—Light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil.Mormonism is not popular, andfew, comparatively speaking, haveembraced it. Jesus Christ wasnever popular in his day. The oldpatriarchs and prophets had butfew friends, yet they were called and inspired by God, and held intheir places and to warn themtheir hands the issues of life anddeath the keys of salvation on earth and in heaven. What they bound on earth was bound in hea-ven. Whosesoever sins they remit-ted were remitted, and whosesoeversins they retained were retained.Yet the world was ready to destroythem. It is so to-day. But  theunbelief of this generation will notmake the truth of God without ef-fect to-day any more than it did inany other period of the world. Therefore I say to my brethren andsisters,  let us try and prepare our minds and hearts by prayer before the Lord, that we may obtain enough of the light of the Spiritand of the influence of the HolyGhost, to see and be preserved inthe path of life, and when we re-ceive the teachings and counsels ofthe servants of God, that we maybe disposed to treasure them up in our hearts and practice them in ourlives.We shall soon pass away; in alittle while we shall be on the otherside of the vail. There is no manor woman who has ever lived on theearth and kept the commandmentof God who will be ashamed of, or sorry for it, when they go into thepresence of God. Our eyes havenot seen, our ears have not heard, it has not entered into the heart of man to conceive the joy, glory andblessings which God has in store forhis faithful Saints. As PresidentYoung told us yesterday, whethermen believe or disbelieve, the LordAlmighty has wrought out salva-tion for the world. We are laboringfor this; the prophets and patriarchs in days past and gone did the same.In these latter days saviors havecome up on Mount Zion, and theyare laboring to save the world—theliving and the dead. The Lord re-quires this at our hands, and if we do not labor to promote this causeand to build it up, we shall beunder condemnation before him.The gospel is the same to-day asit was in the days of Jesus Christ.The word to his disciples was—"Go ye into all the world and preach thegospel to every creature, he thatbelieveth and is baptized shall besaved, and he that believeth notshall be damned." [##Mark 16:15-16##] That is a very plain and simple declaration, yet itinvolved the destiny of the whole human family. It is just so to-day. The gospel has been offered to theworld now for over forty years, in its purity, plainness and clearness,according to the ancient order ofthings, and the elders of Israel havepromised the world that if they would receive their testimony andbe baptized for the remissionof their sins, they should receive theHoly Ghost.  When a man receives the Holy Ghost he has a testimony that can not deceive him or any-body else. In the days of Mosesand Pharaoh the magicians could work as many miracles as Moses,almost; and you may go into ourtheatre here, or any other, and youmay see and hear that which will deceive your eyes and ears, and allthe senses you have; but get theHoly Ghost and you have a testi-mony that cannot deceive you. It never deceived any man, and itnever will. It is by this power andprinciple that the elders of Israelhave been sustained from the first day they commenced their laborsuntil to-day. It was this power which sustained Joseph Smithfrom his boyhood up, in all his labors un-til he planted the Kingdom of Godon the earth to be thrown down nomore for ever. He lived until heaccomplished all that God raisedhim up to do here in the flesh, thenhe went to the other side of the vail to fill his place and missionthere. His works will follow himthere, and he and his brethren will labor for the accomplishment of thepurposes of God there, as we aredoing here.  The Lord raised up President Young to be our leader and lawgiver, and he has been so from the day that Joseph was taken away. His works are before theworld and before the heavens; they show for themselves. The tree isknown by the fruit it brings forth.The Lord has revealed in this dayevery key that was ever held by any patriarch or prophet from thedays of Father Adam, in the Garden of Eden, down to the daysof Joseph Smith, that was neces-sary for the salvation of the sons of men. They have been sealed on the head of Brigham Young andother servants of God, and they willbe held on the earth until thisscene is wound up.  What a glori-ous thing it is that we, like the an-cient Saints, can be baptized for

 July 5, 1866. THE DESERET NEWS. 243tion as full of tradition as the inhabi-tants of the earth were in the days of Noah, and almost as unbelieving as that generation were? [##Moses 8:19-26##] He had to combat the errors of our forefathers which had been handed down for generations. He built upon the same foundation that Jesus and the Apostles built upon. He preached the same gospel accompanied by the same ordinances that they preached. He organized the Church in the same way, with the same gifts and blessings, and the same Spirit accompa-nied the gospel to those who believed. The elders went forth calling upon the children of men to repent and be bap-tized for the remission of sins, and have hands laid upon them that they might receive the Holy Ghost. And the tes-timony was, that if they obeyed the gospel they would receive that Spirit. Did the Lord sustain that testimony by giving the Holy Ghost from the Hea-vens? He did, as every faithful man and woman in this Church knows and can bear testimony to before God, an-gels and men. This was a great work. He lived until he sent the Gospel to the nations of the earth; he built temples, gave endowments to the Twelve and others, and told them that they must bear off this kingdom. He accomplished all that the Lord required of him, and he sealed his testimony with his blood; and his testimony is in force to-day.Had Joseph Smith shrunk from theduty which God required of him; had he said, "It is unpopular, I will not make as much by preaching the gospel as if I were to let it alone, I will only be persecuted," the consequence would have been he would have been damned. The Lord would have taken the priest-hood from him, and held him responsi-ble for the testimony he had given him. We are all in this position. If we do not do our duty and bear a faithful tes-timony to this generation, the Lord will hold us responsible. This genera-tion, who have shed the blood of Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum and oth-ers of the anointed of God, are held re-sponsible for so doing before high Hea-ven, and the judgments of God will follow them for shedding innocent blood.But did the kingdom stop when the prophets were put to death? No, for it is the kingdom of God. It fell to the lot of brother Brigham Young to receivethe priesthood and hold the keys of the kingdom. You who have been acquain-ted with him for the past thirty yearsknow his life. You know what he has accomplished. I have traveled manythousands of miles with him, and havebeen familiar with his labors. No man ever lived in the flesh who traveled more miles to carry salvation to the children of men, who preached more and did more for the redemption of mankind and to carry out the purposes of God, during thirty years, than he has done and is doing. The Lord has sustained him, for he is going to cut hiswork short in righteousness. He is de-termined to build up His kingdom as He has promised. Did you ever see an elder refuse when called upon to go on a mission to preach the gospel? Hardly one in five thousand. This is because they are true and faithful unto God. The Spirit of God is in them. The Lord has planted that Spirit in them that they might go and work to build up this kingdom.The world feel to-day concerning "Mormonism" and this people as they did in the days of Noah and Lot con-cerning the revelations of God and those who believed them then. But what of it? The unbelief of men does not make the work of God of no effect. The Lord requires faithfulness at our hands; and if we do not do our duty we will be held responsible before high Heaven for the use we make of the holy priesthoodwhich has been bestowed upon us.While I sat and gazed, last Confer-ence, upon the vast assembly of elders who were here in this Tabernacle, Ithought of the words of Isaiah, when his mind was opened and he looked in vision upon the future. Said he, "Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth; andbreak forth into singing, O mountains; for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon His afflict-ed." [##Isaiah 49:13##] What do you see, Isaiah, that should cause you to break forth in such language as this? I see what the Godsof eternity see. I see what all the pro-phets and patriarchs before me have seen—that the Lord Almighty will build up his Zion upon the earth in great power and glory in the latter days. Yes, "But Zion said, the Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me. Thy chil-dren shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee." (Elder Woodruff quoted from the ##Isaiah 49:13-26|13th to the 26th verse of Isaiah 49th chap##; the ##Isaiah 52:1-3, 7-8|1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 verses of the 52nd chap##; and the ##Isaiah 60:1-5, 13-15, 22|1, 2, 3, 4, 5 13, 14, 15 and 22 verses of the 60th chap.##)Thus chapter after chapter he goes on to declare that Zion's strength is inthe Lord Almighty; and His strength is with her because of her faithfulness and integrity. If the elders of Israel had the vision of their minds opened to see Zion in her beauty and glory, they would have no time to sin or do evil; but they would rise up in the strength of the Lord God of Israel and accomp-lish all that he requires at their hands. Zion is yet in her weakness, but the little one shall become thousands, and the small one a great nation. We talk of the future and of the promises of God to us. They are worthy to be talked of, worthy to be lived for, and to rejoice over, because they are true.We have warned our own and other nations; and so far our garments areclear of the blood of this generation. There never were men in the flesh who labored harder and tried more to fulfil the commandments of God than the elders of this Church have done. Someof our elders have traveled over 100,000miles in thirty years to preach the Gos-pel and build up the kingdom of God; and the Lord Almighty has labored with us.I have an anxiety—a strong desire, to see the people of the Latter-day Saints—the inhabitants of Zion, rise up and put on their strength. I desire to see them increase in the knowledge of the truth, in faith and good works, and inthe knowledge of the things of the kingdom of God. The Lord is notpleased with wickedness and sin. Letany man look at our own beloved coun-try. There is more crime now com-mitted in ten years in it, than used to be in a century. Will the Lord bear with this? No, He will not. He hasalready destroyed two great and power-ful nations that dwelt on this conti-nent, and the remnants of another arescattered over the country in the miser-able few who bear the marks of the curse of God upon them—the In-dians. If men shed innocent blood, dowickedly and work iniquity, the seed that they sow they must reap the har-vest of.If the Latter-day Saints, to whom the Lord has revealed the light and truthof the gospel, were to prove unfaithfuland rebel against God, they would becursed below any people on the earth, below even these miserable Lamanitesthat we see wandering around our set-tlements; for we know more than theyor their fathers knew; we know better what the mind and will of God is. It is that knowledge that has sustained usfor the last thirty years, and over. We know this is the kingdom of God; that we are the friends of God; that the kingdom will stand; and woe be to that nation, kindred, tongue or people, to that individual or family under the whole heaven that lifts a hand againstthe Lord's anointed or against thefriends of God, for they will feel thechastening hand of God. We wish this generation well, and we have laboredhard to try and save them. Whether men believe or disbelieve is nothing tous; it is our business to keep the com-mandments of God. If we live so as to keep the Spirit of God with us we will have power to do good and to carry outthe things which He requires at our hands.Be true and faithful; do your duty to yourselves, to your country, to your God, and to one another. When we do this we shall overcome and inherit eter-nal lives. May God grant that we may do so for Christ's sake. Amen. 
 The Latter Day Saint, in the vision of his mindsees displayed on the great panorama of the world all the scenes that are to transpire in the present day, while the wicked are ignorant of what is about to transpire; they do not know what is the matter; while there are cholera, whirlwinds, storms,thunder and lightning, and earthquakes in divers places, and kingdom is rising against kingdom in battle array, they are ignorant of what will be the end of these matters, and the cause of their ex-istence, because the things of God are not before their eyes. They see naturally but do not under-stand. They read the Scriptures but do not look for the fulfilment of the words of the prophets,and they do not understand what those things mean when they are fulfilled before their eyes. Did they understand the Scriptures they could see and understand what is the matter in the world.But this is only the beginning of sorrow and trouble; the heavens are full of great judgments which are about to be poured out on the world. The words of the prophets cannot have their ful-filment unless these things take place. Read the revelations of Saint John touching the fall of Babylon, and you there have a faint picture of what is about to transpire.I feel thankful that the Lord has revealed these things for our benefit, and that he has given us power and authority to stand up in the defence of that which is right before the Lord, and to bear tes-timony of the truth and to proclaim those things which will assuredly come to pass in this genera-tion. It is better for us to fall in defence of truth, than to deny the words of God, and go tohell. It is better to suffer stripes for the testimo-ny of Christ, than to suffer and fall by our sins and transgressions, and then have to suffer after-wards. I would rather seal my testimony with my blood, and lay my body to rest in the grave, and have my spirit go to the other side of the vail, to enjoy a long eternity of light, truth, bles-sings, and knowledge which the Lord will be-stow upon every man who keeps his law, than to spend a few short years of earthly pleasure, and be deprived of those blessings, and the society of my friends and brethren behind the vail.There is no man in his sober senses that would not desire this. There is no man that has an understanding of the blessings that God has pro-mised to give to his children but what will desire that in preference to the fading enjoyments, and empty honors of this world. You may surround any man or woman with all the wealth and glory that the imagination of man can grasp, and are they satisfied? No. There is still an aching void. On the other hand, show me a beggar up-on the streets, who has got the Holy Ghost, whose mind is filled with that Spirit and power, and I will show you a person who has peace of mind, who possesses true riches, and those enjoyments that no man can obtain from any other scource. The servants of God in every age of the world, have been sustained and nerved up to do their duty by this power; and I will say to the LatterDay Saints if they will be faithful, and do what they should do, and listen to the counsel given to them, they need not have any fears about any-thing, for the whole work is in the hands of God, the destinies of nations lie there. It is better for a people to be wise, to get righteousness, to be the friend of God than to occupy any other po-sition in life.Then I hope my brethren and sisters will feel in their hearts to sustain the Presidency of this Church by their faith, works, and prayers, and not suffer them to carry all the load, while we hide ourselves in the rear. If we should do this we are not worthy, we are not worthy of our po-sition as Elders in Israel, and fathers and mothers in Israel. Let each one bear their share; and if we will correct our own follies, and set in order our own houses, and do that which is right, weshall then do some good, and help to lift the load that rests upon those that lead. It was grievous to the feelings of Jesus Christ, to his Apostles, and to Joseph Smith, when they saw the people running into danger, and it is grievous to President Young, when he sees the people reckless in pursuing their own course leading them to destruction; when they are not willing to take his counsel and abide the doctrines he teaches; but when he sees the people willing to obey wholesome counsel, and endeavor to sanctify themselves before the Lord, he feels strengthened and sustained, he feels backed up by the works of the people, and not by one alone. I hope this will be the case with us, that we will set in or-der our own houses; as wives, husbands, child-ren, as parents, and as officers in the Church and Kingdom of God. If we will sanctify ourselves, and do right we shall have our reward, and shall be satisfied with it. No man or woman in the Kingdom of God that does wrong can escape sor-row. It is so in the world; the Lord rewards all men according as their works have been in the body. One reason why the Lord will pour out his judgements upon the nations, is the blasphe-mous spirit of wickedness and corruption that reigns among men.When the Gentiles reject the Gospel it will be taken from them, and go to the house of Israel, to that long suffering people that are now scat-tered abroad through all the nations upon the earth, and they will be gathered home by thou-sands, and by hundreds of thousands, and they will re-build Jerusalem their ancient city, and make it more glorious than at the beginning, andthey will have a leader in Israel with them, a man that is full of the power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost; but they are held now from this work, only because the fulness of the gentiles has not yet come in. Tens of thousands among the gentile nations will receive the gospel, but the ma-jority of them will reject it, and then the Jews will receive it; and it will go to them with all the gifts, blessings, and powers it possessed when it was taken from them.We are all gentiles by nationality, we are of the gentile nations who hold the sway of the earth. Not only will the Jews have these blessings again, but these poor despised Indians will enjoy thelight and glory of the Gospel of Christ, their fathers proclaimed blessings upon them, by the spirit of prophecy and revelation, which are as as-suredly to rest upon a remnant of that people as they exist, though they are now the most misera-ble beings that live upon the face of the earth, nevertherless a remnant of them will embrace the gospel, and their eyes will be opened and they will understand that they are of Israel. Our missionaries have labored among them, and what effect has it had? But little. Missionaries of dif-ferent orders have labored among them, with little or no success.We cannot do a great deal for that people, only pray for them, and treat them kindly, until the power of God begins to rest upon them, and they are waked up by the visions of heaven, and the angels begin to converse with them. They will be inspired by the Spirit and power of God, like other branches of Israel, and the day will come when the poor Utahs, and Piedes, and other de-graded tribes in these mountains will again feel they possess souls among men as their fathers did before them. The ten tribes will also come in re-membrance before the Lord, and they will again return with out stretched arms to their lands and be led by leaders inspired by the Spirit and power of God, and they will come with visions, revela-tions, and prophets, and they will be baptized and ordained under the hands of the children of Ephraim, who bear the Holy Priesthood on the earth at that time, and they will be crowned with glory, power, immortality and eternal lives before God.This is only a synopsis of the vision of the things that present themselves to our minds, while we sit and meditate upon the scenes that present themselves to our view. No man can contem-plate the truth concerning the nations of the earth without sorrow, when he sees the wailing, the mourning, and death, that will come in conse-quence of judgments, plagues, and war. It has already begun, and it will continue to multiply and increase until the scene is ended, and wound up.Do I delight in the destruction of the children of men? No. Does the Lord? No. He gives them timely warning, and if they do not listen to his counsel they must suffer the consequences. He has determined in the last days, in spite of earth and hell, wicked men, and devils, to estab-lish his kingdom upon the earth; He has pro-claimed it in the Bible, that it shall not be thrown down any more for ever. Who owns the earth? Does the devil? No; but he has had it a great while, and holds universal sway, and has held it al-most from the beginning; so much so that if the Lord inspires a man upon the earth, the power of the devil is so great, that that man is, or men are slain. Even Christ and his Apostles could but exist in tribulation and suffering for a little while, and then were slain. The power of the devil was so great that the principles of righteouseess were driven from the earth, and those that taught them. But, hark! in the last days it will not be so, the time has come for the kingdom to be es-tablished, because the earth is ripe, and the set time has come.The Lord made the earth, and placed man up-on it, and he owns it still, and he will cut off wickedness, no matter where it exists, so that there will be room for the good fruit to grow. As true as the Lord lives if we wish to exist up-on the earth in these days we must be righteous;if we expect to have a place, an inheritance, and dwell on the earth, we must keep the law of God, or we shall be cut off. This will apply to all, to Jew and Gentile, bond and free; this will apply to all men in every nation, and under all circum-stances.It is the decree of the Almighty God that the kingdom of heaven shall be established, and shall never again be overthrown, that judgments shall lay waste the nations, enough at least to give that kingdom room to grow, and spread and pros-per. This is the truth and you will all find it so. Those judgments have begun that will never leave the earth until it is swept as with the besom of destruction, until thrones are cast down and kingdoms overthrown, until each man draws his sword against his neighbor, and every nation and kingdom that exists will be at war with each other, except the inhabitants of Zion. The Lord has spoken it, and it will come to pass.I again say I am thankful that we have men to preside over us, who are determined to rebuke sin wherever it shows itself and God will sustain these men, and uphold them whether we do or not. I do not care in what circumstances they may be placed, even if it be necessary for them to seal their testimony with their blood, as Joseph and Hyrum have done; it is all right, they only pass to the other side of the vail, where they can operate still better for the salvation of the people. We shall not be left without leaders that have the Spirit of God. This people will always have lead-ers that are just men, that are good men, and that delight to do the will of God, and would sacrifice life and all things for it if required.If we are afraid to rebuke iniquity, or ashamed to cast it off ourselves, Israel would go to hell, we should be cut off as a people, and the Lord would raise up another; for he is bound to have a people in the last days who will keep his com-mandments, and magnify their calling, and prove themselves friends of God, and maintain the prin-ciples of righteousness, and honor them before God, angels, and men, that his kingdom may be established in purity, and be prepared for the coming of the Messiah; for Christ is coming again to earth; he is preparing the bride, and here is a portion of it before me to-day.Will he receive us to himself? Are we pre-pared for his coming and kingdom and the fulness thereof, unless we are sanctified and lay aside sin, and do right? No. We must sanctify ourselves, and keep the commandments of God, and do those things that are required at our hands before we can be prepared for the coming of the Great Bridegroom.The signs of the heavens are appearing, thefig trees are leaving and showing that summer is nigh. It will overtake this generation, and us al-so, quite as soon as we are prepared for it.I pray that we may live in such a manner as not to be among the foolish virgins, but under-stand the signs of the times, do our duty, main-tain our integrity, overcome the world, and be prepared to receive our Redeemer when he comes with joy, and not in grief and shame; which may God grant for Christ's sake: AMEN. 
 REMARKSMade at the Salt Lake Stake Confer-ence, Sunday, December 29th, 1897.byPRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.-[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-"Wide is the gate, and broad is theway, that leadeth to destruction, andmany there be which go in thereat:"Because strait is the gate, and nar-row is the way, which leadeth unto life,and few there be that find it." [##Matthew 7:13-14##]I look upon that as one of the most important sayings of Jesus Christ whileteaching the people in His day. Few there are that find the straight andnarrow way. To read such sayings of the Savior as those sets one to reflect-ing. If it is necessary for the children of men to receive the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to attend to the ordinances of His house, in order to be saved in the kingdom of God, certainly it would appear as if very few will be saved in the celestial kingdom of our God. When the Lord called Joseph Smith,he received the ministrations of Mo-roni, an angel of God from heaven. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:30-47##]According to the teachings that weregiven to him by the Lord and by the angels of heaven, there was no organi-zation on the face of the whole earth at that time that was accepted of the Lord as His Church. Joseph Smithhad received the holy Priesthood by the administration of angels from God out of heaven before he himself was prepared to preach the Gospel. Thework that he commenced was like a lit-tle mustard seed. Those that followedhim were very few in number;and the same spirit of opposition which was manifest in the days of the Savior and in the days of the prophets was manifest in his day and time. He met with the same fate as the Sonof God and His Apostles did. All laid down their lives and sealed their testi-mony by the shedding of their blood, excepting John the Revelator, and he was preserved by the power of God.This is a subject of vast importance to the inhabitante of the earth, in-cluding the Latter-day Saints. Accord-ing to statisticians, there are about fourteen hundred millions of human beings on the earth. Now, if the Latter-day Saints are all who have receivedthe Gospel of Christ since the organiz-[a]tion of the Church, then the numbers who are preparing to go into thecelestial kingdom of God are certainlyvery few. Even if the Latter-day Saints numbered a half million, theywould be a very small percentage of the inhabitants of the earth.There was a small congregation of Latter-day Saints here this morning, and we listened to a number of theBishops represent their wards and tes-tify concerning tithing, the expense ofcaring for the poor, and the positionthey were in. I thought to myself that if we had the desire in our hearts tobe one of that number who will go to receive eternal life in the celestial kingdom of God, and to be where God and Christ dwell, it would certainly payus to thoroughly keep the command-ments of God and do our duty. Itcauses singular reflections to look uponthe history of the inhabitants of theearth. It does not make much differencewhat part of the world you take, nor what age, mankind have been proneto evil and to yield to the enemy. One-third of the hosts of heaven are repre-sented as having been cast down from heaven to earth. They are fallen angels, who have been on the earth, I suppose, ever since they were cast out of heaven. What is their mission? It is to work against God and against Christ; to lead the chil-dren of men to do that which is evil, that they may have power and domin-ion over them in this world and in theworld to come. The children of men in every age have had these fallenspirits to contend with. These powers have been manifest from the fall of Adam down to our day, and will con-tinue until He who holds the keys of death and hell will bind Satan andshut him up in prison for one thousandyears, after which he will be liberated to perform his last act for the destruc-tion of the sons of men.In reflecting over these things, and seeing how it has been in days that arepast and gone, it seems, if we are to judge from the revelations and fromthe saying of the Savior which I have quoted, that there are very few who find the straight and narrow way that leads to eternal life. But the Latter-day Saints have a desire to be saved in the kingdom of God. This is a great desire, and it should be with all men. We should understand that it will payus to strive to do right and to keep the commandments of God, that when weget through we may receive those blessings that we are looking for; that we may meet with the Lord, meet with Father Adam, with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, with the patriarchs andprophets, and with the few Saints that have been in the flesh on the earth. Ibelieve this is your desire. It is my desire. I have desired it from my boy-hood up. I have thought sometimes that I have made rather a poor at-tempt at it; perhaps many of us havefelt the same; but I think that the lit-tle time we have to be here it will payus to look carefully to our ways and to keep the commandments of God. Itwill be worth our while to pay our tithing and attend to every other dutythat God requires at our hands while we dwell here, that when we get through we may be satisfied. This ismy desire with regard to the Latter-day Saints. For when we realize the few that will enter into eternal life compared with those that will go the broad road, it is lamentable.As Latter-day Saints we have re-ceived the Priesthood; the command-ments of God have been made knownto us; and we have set before us, through the mouths of inspired men, those principles that shall lead us inthe path of life and salvation. Now,in view of these things, what will it profit us to sin? What is there in thislife that will pay us to lose all those blessings which belong to the first resurrection and to the kingdom of heaven? It is within our power, bykeeping the commandments of God, tocome forth out of our graves, clothedin immortal, celestial bodies, with ourwives, our children, our fathers, ourmothers, our relatives, and our friends,and occupy high and exalted positions in the presence of God and the Lamb,and dwell with them forever and for-ever. What is there, brethren and sis-ters, in this world or anywhere else, that will pay us to pursue a course whereby we shall lose the fulfillment of these blessings? There is nothing. Far better for us never to have lived in the flesh than to pursue a course whereby we forfeit these blessings.We, as Elders of Israel, have laboredfaithfully to try to save our fellow men in the Gospel of Christ. We havebeen blessed in this. We have traveled among the nations of the earth and the islands of the sea to instruct thechildren of men upon these principles.There is no better calling that a mancan have than to go and preach the Gospel to his fellow man and to save the souls of the children of men. TheLord said to Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer:"And if, it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repent-ance unto this people, and bring, saveit be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of the Father!"And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have broughtunto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!" [##Doctrine and Covenants 18:15-16##]Now, our Elders have saved thou-sands of souls: that is, the Elders have preached the Gospel to them, they havebaptized them, ordained them, and given them their blessings.We ought to look at these things as they are. No matter what the world may think of us, or what their desiremay be about us. Even if we are all saved in the kingdom of God, our numbers will be very few compared with the millions upon millions who have never been willing to receive theGospel in the earth, and who will oc-cupy positions elsewhere than in thepresence of God and the Lamb. I lis-tened to the Bishops this morning talkabout tithing. It will be profitable to us to pay our tithing. It will pay us todo anything else that God requires at our hands. By doing it we will be justified.I thank the Lord for my life. I thank Him for His blessings and mercies to me. I have reason to rejoice in this,and I am obliged to give God the glory for all I have ever received. If I haveever done any good; If I have been ableto preach the Gospel and to pursue a course whereby I have edified my fel-low man, at home or abroad, it has been by the power of God, upon Jesus 
 REMARKSBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,At the General Conference, SundayAfternoon, Oct. 10 th, 1880.-------------REPORTED BY GEO. F. GIBBS.-------------THERE are many times when I feela great desire to speak to the peoplebecause I have things in my heart that I would like to say. I cannotsay at the present time, however, that I have any great desire to speak, still I will bear my testimonyand express a few thoughts in myreflections that are upon me to-day.I am happy and greatly pleased inwhat I have witnessed, and I feel that the heavens are pleased withour proceedings this day. I feel thatthey are right. The kingdom of Godis onward; it is not backward. It iswisdom that we perform what wehave done this day.The act of organizing the councilof the first presidency of the churchand kingdom of God, I have regardedas a most solemn scene, to see thismighty host of priesthood who are assembled in this house vote in suchunanimity, and to see this vast con-gregation rise in a body with upliftedhands to heaven, it is like the rush-ing of many waters—there is powerin it; there is power with this peo-ple; there is power with the priest-hood and in the ordinances of the house of God. And what we have done to-day will have its effect it will have its effect in the heavens and on the earth.  The responsibil-ity that we bear as elders of Israel,before the heavens and before theearth and before each other, is verygreat. We are called of God; wehave been chosen, we have been or-dained as men who have been calledto bear the priesthood and to attend to the ordinances of the house of God, to preach the gospel, to warnthis generation, to build up Zion, to redeem the earth, to erect temples unto the name of the Most High God, to redeem the living and thedead and to carry out those greatpurposes which have been fore-or-dained before the world was. It is a great calling, it is a great responsi-bility: and I feel that we, as ser-vants of God and as elders of Israel, that we should try in our minds tocomprehend these things.I reflect a good deal with regard toour position, as was described to us to-day by Brother Pratt.  It has been my faith and belief from thetime that I was made acquainted with the gospel that no greater pro-phet than Joseph Smith ever lived on the face of the earth save Jesus Christ. He was raised up to standat the head of this great dispensa-tion—the greatest of all dispensationsGod has ever given to man. He re-marked on several occasions whenconversing with his brethren:"brethren, you do not know me, youdo not know who I am." As I re-marked at our priesthood meetingon Friday evening, I have heard him in my early days while conversing with the brethren, say, (at the same time smiting himself on the breast) "I would to God that I could unbo-som my feelings in the house of myfriends." Joseph Smith was or-dained before he came here, thesame as Jeremiah was. Said the Lord unto him, "Before you werebegotten I knew you" &c.So do I believe with regard to this people, so do I believe with regard to the apostles, the high priests, seventies and the elders of Isreal bearing the holy priesthood, I believethey were ordained before they came here; and I believe the God of Israelhas raised them up, and has watchedover them from their youth, and hascarried them through all the scenesof life both seen and unseen, and has prepared them as instruments in his hands to take this kingdom and bearit off. If this be so, what manner of men ought we to be? If anythingunder the heavens should humble men before the Lord and before one another, it should be the fact that we have been called of God.I believe the eyes of the heavenly hosts are over this people; I believethey are watching the elders of Is-rael, the prophets and apostles and men are called to bear off thiskingdom. I believe they watchover us all with great interest.I will here make a remark con-cerning my own feelings.  Afterthe death of Joseph Smith I saw and conversed with him many timesin my dreams in the night season. On one occasion he and his brotherHyrum met me when on the sea go-ing on a mission to England. I had Dan Jones with me. He received his mission from Joseph Smith be-fore his death; and the prophet talked freely to me about the mis-sion I was then going to perform.And he also talked to me with regardto the mission of the Twelve Apostlesin the flesh, and he laid before methe work they had to perform; and he also spoke of the reward they would receive after death. Andthere were many other things he laid before me in his interview onthat occasion. And when I awoke many of the things he had told me were taken from me, I could notcomprehend them. I have had many interviews with Brother Jos-eph until the last 15 or 20 years of my life; I have not seen him for that length of time. But during mytravels in the southern country last winter I had many interviews with President Young, and with HeberC. Kimball, and Geo. A. Smith, andJedediah M. Grant, and many others who are dead. They attended our conference, they attended ourmeetings. And on one occasion, Isaw Brother Brigham and Brother Heber ride in carriage ahead of the carriage in which I rode when I was on my way to attend conference;and they were dressed in the mostpriestly robes. When we arrived atour destination I asked Prest. Youngif he would preach to us. He said,"No, I have finished my testimony in the flesh I shall not talk to thispeople any more. But (said he) I have come to see you; I have come to watch over you, and to see whatthe people are doing. Then (saidhe) I want you to teach the people—and I want you to follow this coun-sel yourself—that they must laborand so live as to obtain the HolySpirit, for without this you cannotbuild up this kingdom; without theSpirit of God you are in danger of walking in the dark, and in dangerof failing to accomplish your callingas apostles and as elders in thechurch and kingdom of God.And, said he Brother Josephtaught me this principle." And Iwill here say, I have heard him refer to that while he was living. But what I was going to say in this: thethought came to me that Brother Joseph had left the work of watch-ing over this church and kingdom toothers, and that he had gone ahead, and that he had left this work tomen who have lived and laboredwith us since he left us. This ideamanifested itself to me, that suchmen advance in the spirit world.And I believe myself that these menwho have died and gone into thespirit world had this mission leftwith them, that is, a certain portionof them, to watch over the Latter-day Saints.I feel myself as though we areblessed of the Lord, and that weought to be satisfied. I feel that we should humble ourselves before God,that we should labor to magnify ourcalling, and honor this priesthoodwhich we received before we camehere while we live out the few days appointed to man in the flesh. And I do hope and pray God that we maymagnify our priesthood and calling while we tarry here, so that whenwe get through our earthly missionand go into the spirit world, we may meet with Brothers Joseph andBrigham and Heber and the rest ofthe faithful men whom we knewand labored with while in the flesh,as well as Father Adam, Enoch,Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and allthe prophets and apostles who havehad their day and their time and their generation, and who have fin-ished their work here below and gone home to glory. Do you notthink they are interested about us?I tell you they are. And I desire when I die, and my spirit goes into the spirit world, to meet these menand to go where they are; and I wishto live in that way and manner soas to be worthy of this blessing. And when I say this of myself Iwish it to apply to all Israel. It will not pay us apostatize; neitherwill it pay us to sin, it costs ten thousand times more than it is worthfrom beginning to end. Therefore,let us be true and faithful to God. And inasmuch as we have voted to-day to sustain the presidency of thischurch and kingdom, let our prayersascend night and morning into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth in behalf of the men who now stand at our head, and also in behalf of the apos-tles and in behalf of all the priesthood of God in their place and station. And inasmuch as we do this we willgrow, we will advance, the Spirit of God will be poured out upon uswhich will reveal unto us the mindand the will of God concerning us.And Zion will continue to increase in power on the earth, and eventually accomplish all for which it is de-signed, which is my prayer in the name of Jesus.   Amen. 
 DISCOURSEBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,At the General Conference, SundayMorning, April 3, 1881.REPORTED BY GEORGE F. GIBBS.I THINK that all of us as Latter-day Saints should have our hearts filled with gratitude and thanksgiving to God our Heavenly Father for hismercies and blessi[n]gs which we en-joy this day. It is certainly a source of much pleasure to me to have theprivilege of meeting with so manyof the Latter-day Saints, and withso many bearing the Holy Priest-hood in this dispensation of God toman. I cannot but rejoice when I re-flect upon the history of this people,and contemplate the dealingsof Godwith us, how that He has protect-ed us and sustained us and delivered us and made us a community in the land, and that too under adversity and opposition.In tracing the history of the Pro-phets and Apostles of old as wellas those of our day, we find that there have been some very peculiarmanifestations of the trust and con-fidence in God that they have exer-cised. Consider, for instance, theposition of the Three Hebrews. Theycould afford to trust themselves in the hands of God; they could afford to meet whatever punishment or afflic-tion or persecution that might be heaped upon them in consequenceof their obeying the law of God. Butthey could not afford to bow downand worship the image which Nebu-chadnezzer had caused to be set up,because it was contrary to the com-mandments of God. The history of the result of their refusing to obeythe royal edict, commanding all Babylon to fall down and worship it,we are familiar with; also with thesimilar circumstance in which theProphet Daniel figured. [##Daniel 3##] In any andevery age of the world when God has called or commanded a man or apeople to perform a certain work,they through determination and per-severence, and faith in Him, havebeen enabled to accomplish it; and Ido not know of a single instance wherein anything ennobling or ex-alting has been gained when His command has been shunned or wil-fully disobeyed. I will here men-tion the case of Jonah, which pre-sents itself to my mind, when theLord sent him to deliver a messageto Ninevah. The requirementwas a little too much forJonah, and he thought he wouldtry to av[o]id it; but after he hadspent three days and nights in thebelly of a whale, he thought, no doubt, that if ever he got to land hewould unhesitatingly obey the com-mandments of the Lord. [##Jonah 1##] The result we know. We take our Savior, and also the Apostles who followed him;we read the history of what theysuffered and passed through. All ofthe Apostle suffered death (except-ing one, whom they could not destroy), including the Son of Godhimself, in order to seal their testi-mony with their blood; while the Savior had to suffer upon the cross,to fill the mission that he had been p[r]eordained to perform; which, bythe way, is a very strange e[n]sampleto man, to see the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father on the earth, the First Born in the spiritworld, a person of His high exalta-tion and glory, condescending tocome forth to be born in a stable andcradled in a manger; and after He grew up, how He traveled about inadversity and suffering, never shrinking from any duty imposed upon him—it should certainly be a good ensample to all of His follow-ers. And the Apostles themselves,because of their integrity to the truths of the gospel which they had received through their Master, theSavior, they like Him, suffered death, and thus sealed their testimonywith their blood. They could per-form no more than he could towardsturning the hearts of the people tothe truth; but they determine torisk whatever suffering, trouble or tribulation they were called to passthrough for the word of God, and thetestimony of Jesus, that they might receive eternal life.I bring this home to ourselves. Ibring it home to the Latter-daySaints; I bring it home to our dayand generation. Many of us have been acquainted with our Prophet and Patriarch, Joseph and Hyrum Smith. We know their lives; we know the suffering and trouble they passed through. These men are true and faithful unto death. They could afford to do it; but they could not afford to deny the faith; theycould not afford to shrink from theimportant message which God had given unto them, of establishing this Church and kingdom upon theearth, but they could afford to betrue and faithful to the last mo-ments of their lives, in advocatingand defending the principles of thegospel of the Son of God. I wish to say to our leading men, the Presi-dency of this Church, the TwelveApostles, the Presidents of Sta[k]esand their Counselors, the Bishops,the Seventies, the High Priests andElders, and to all men bearing theHoly Priesthood, as well as to all who have entered into covenant with God, that we can, as individuals and as a people, afford to main-tain our integrity in this our day and generation, regardless of conse-quences. We can afford to be true and faithful to God; we can afford tocarry out every principle and com-mandment which God has givenunto us; we can afford to do this, asmuch so as Prophets and Apostlesand people of God of other dispensa-tions and generations. And I wouldsay to all Israel, there is not one soul of us who can afford to compromise one of the revelations or one of thecommandments which God hascommitted to our charge. No mancan afford to do this who is called of God to build up this Kingdom. We can afford, however, to meetthe consequences, whatever theymay be. And I would say to all present this day that we shouldhave, and that we have as much comfort, as much hope and as muchcause to trust in God, and have re-ceived as much encouragement, bythe over-ruling hand of AlmightyGod in our behalf,  to go on magnify-ing our calling and to be true andfaithful to every commandment which God has given unto us, as thepeople of any other generation hadin their day; and for one I can say,"It is the kingdom of God or no-thing" for me, and I am willing to risk the consequences. I know thatI cannot afford to disobey any com-mandment which God has given to me, because there is no man who holds the Priesthood, and possessingthe inspiration and the gifts of God and the light of truth, but would be ashamed both in the flesh and in the spirit-world to meet his God, andto be obliged to acknowledge that hedid not obey His commandments. And I will here say that wheneverwe do our duty, whenever we keepthe commandments which have been made known to us, we will see the fulfilment of the promises which God has made to us with regard to this day, age and dispensation. There is no pro-mise which God has made to us butthat will be fulfilled to the very letter. I read these—the Bible, theBook of Mormon, the Doctrine andCovenants, and I regard them aseternal truths. I cannot find any revelations given from the days of Moses down to the days of Joseph Smith, nor from the days ofJoseph to our day, by men who have spoken as they weremoved upon by the Holy Ghost but what has been fulfilled to the very letter, as far as time wouldadmit of. Though the heavens and the earth pass away, not one jot ortittle that will fall unfulfilled. No. When I read these solemn, these eternaldeclarations made through the mouth of Joseph Smith, no, my heartswells with gratitude and praise toGod, my heavenly Father. I consid-er that the Doctrine and Covenants, our Testament, contains a code of the most solemn, the most Godlikeproclamations ever made to the hu-man family. I will refer tothe "Vision" alone, as a rev-elation which gives more light, more truth, and more principle than anyrevelation contained in any otherbook we ever read. [##Doctrine and Covenants 76##] It makes plain to our understanding our presentcondition, where we came from,why we are here, and where we aregoing to. Any man may knowthrough that revelation what hispart and condition will be. For all men know what laws they keep,and the laws that men keep herewill determine their position here-after; they will be preserved by those laws and receive the blessingswhich belong to them.I say a[g]ain, the Latter-day Saintshave every encouragement; theirpathway is plain and inviting before them. And the nearer we adhere to the commandments of God, themore confident we shall becomethat God is our friend and that He is watching over us and that Hisson Jesus is our advocate, with the Father, that He is in the midst ofthis people, and that He will con-tend for the rights of his Saints, and will ward off every weapon thatis formed against Zion. So far atleast we have been sustain-ed; the arm of Jehovah has beenmade bare in our behalf ever since we have been in these valleys, and all Israel whose eyes are open to see and whose minds can comprehendthe dealings of God with his people, know it. We have been sustained by the power of God from the be-ginning to this day, and nothingshort of the power of God could have saved us and brought us through;and nothing but the power of G[o]d can preserve us, and nothing butHis wisdom can pilot us safe to thehigh destiny that awaits us. Per-haps I may be permitted to say, we met with a good deal of persecution and oppression and suffering be-fore we came to these valleys, andstill the hand of oppression is stretch-ed out against us, and  the public mind everywhere within the pale ofChristendom is more or less set on our destruction, and that because a certain Biblical principle—the patri-archal order of marriage is practised by us. When Earl R[o]sborough was visiting this city, he inquired of President Taylor what excuse the State of Missouri had in drivingten thousand of this people beyond their borders into the State of Illi-nois; and what excuse the people of this nation had who took part in,and those who countenanced the persecution that we have endured, for persecuting us before the princi-ple of patriarchal marriage waspractised by the Latter-day Saints.President Taylor replied, it was be-cause we believed in revelation, be-cause we believed in Prophets and Apostles, and because we believed in the ancient, the apostolic, the everlasting Gospel, with all its gifts and blessings. Then, said Earl Rosborough, "it would make no dif-ference, as far as your being at vari-ance with the Christian world isconcerned, whether you practiceplural marriage or not, unless yourenounce all other principles youhold to that caused your persecution heretofore; you would be persecuted still." I say the same to day.  Thenation cares no more about our practising the order of plural mar-riage than any other principle of thegospel; it would make no difference with us to-day. Were we to com-promise this principle by saying,we will renounce it, we would thanhave to renounce our belief in rev-elation from God, and our belief in the necessity of Prophets and Apos-tles, and the principle of the gather-ing, and then to do away with theidea and practice of building Tem-ples in which to administer ordin-ances for the exaltation of the livingand the redemption of the dead; andat last we would have to renounceour Church organization, and mix upand mingle with the world, and be-come part of them. Can we afford to do this? I tell you no, we can not;but we can afford to keep the com-mandments of God. And I willhere say, that we have been sustain-ed by the hand of Jehovah in amarvelous and miraculous mannerever since we came to these valleys and proclaimed to the world ourbelief in the revelation of celestialor plural marriage; and I will sayfurther, and in the name of JesusChrist our Savior and Elder Brother, we shall be sustainedfrom this time until He comes in the clouds of heaven, inas-much as we shrink notfrom the performance of our duties. We have somebody to deal with be-sides man. The God of heaven holds our destiny; he holds the des-tiny of our nation and of all the na-tions, and He controls them. There-fore, I say to the Latter-day Saints, let us be faithful; let us keep thecommandments; let us not renouncea single principle or command which God has given to us. Let us keep the word of wisdom. Let us pay our tithes and offerings.  (cont) Let usobey the celestial law of God, thatwe may have our wives and child-ren with us in the morning of thefirst resurrection; that we may comeforth clothed with glory, immortal-ity and eternal lives, with our wives and children bound to us in the family organization in the celestialworld, to dwell with us throughoutthe endless ages of eternity, to-gether with all the sons and daugh-ters of Adam who shall have kept the commandments of God.I pray that we may be able to doour duty in this world. I pray that we may not fear man who can onlykill the body, but fear God who hath power to cast both body and soulinto hell. I feel to say that thereis no people under heaven thathave so much cause to rejoiceand to be grateful than the Latter-day Saints. There is no other peo-ple since the foundation of theworld called to perform the work that you, Latter-day Saints, are called to perform. The God of heav-en has given you the kingdom, the great and last kingdom, the onlykingdom which has ever been set upon this earth to remain until thecoming of the Son of Man. Although in its infancy, this work has a greatand a mighty future; and as I haveoften said, the eyes of all the hosts of heaven are over us; the eyes of God Himself, and the eyes of all [t]he prophets and apostles that haveever lived in the flesh are watching this people. They know that theyare not neither can they be made perfect without you; and they fully understand that we cannot be made perfect without them. They under-stand the greatness, the extent, thepower and the glory of this dispen-sation.When I contemplate the fact thatthe few men and women dwellingin th[e]se mountain valleys have hadcommitted to them this great and mighty work, I feel that of allpeople under heaven we ought to be the most grateful to our God;and that we ought to remember tokeep our covenants, and humble our-selves before him, and labor with allour hearts to discharge faithfully the responsibilities that devolve uponus, and the duties that are required at our hands. For  we can afford todo anything that God requires of us;but none of us can afford to dowrong. It would cost far more thanthis world with all its wealth is worth for the Latter-day Saints todo wrong and come under the disfa-vor of Almighty God. Our prayers,one and all, should be that of David's—"Keep back thy servantalso from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me;then shall I be upright, and I shallbe innocent from the great trans-gression." [##Psalm 19:13##]I pray God to bless this assembly of His people; and to bless the Presi-dency of the Church, the Apostlesand all bearing the Holy Priesthood, together with all who have enteredinto covenant with Him. My ear-nest prayer is that the blessings ofour God may be over us in time, thatwhen we get through and shall passbehind the vail, we shall have doneall that was required of us, and beprepared to dwell with the sanctified and the just made perfect through the blood of the Lamb.   Amen. 
 DISCOURSEBYPREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVEREDIn the Salt Lake Assembly Hall, atthe Half Yearly Conference, ofthe Salt Lake Stake of Zion, Sun-day Afternoon. Jan. 9th, 1881.REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE"Woe unto me, if I preach not thegospel! For if I do this thing willing-ly, I have a righteous reward: a dis-pensation of the gospel is committedunto me." [##1 Corinthians 9:16##] These were the words of the Apostle Paul. Again he said: "But though we or an angel from[heaven preach any other gospel untoyou than that which we have preach-ed unto you, let him be accursed."] And he repeats this. [##Galatians 1:8-9##] Again hesays: "But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: Inwhom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them whichbelieve not, lest the light of the glo-rious gospel of Christ, who is theimage of God, should shine unto them." [##2 Corinthians 4:3-4##] I will say as Paul did, "Woe be unto me if I preach not the gospel." I will say the same for theApostles, the High Priests, the Sev-enties, and the Elders, as far asthey are called to declare the wordsof life and salvation to this generation; the judgments of God will restupon us if we do not do it. You may ask why. I answer, because a dispensation of the gospel of JesusChrist has never been given to manin ancient days or in this age for any other purpose than for the sal-vation of the human family. Again,the Lord says (in ##Doctrine and Covenants 1:4-7|sec. 1## of the Book-of Doctrine and Covenants): "And the voice of warning shall be untoall people by the mouths of my dis-ciples, whom I have chosen in theselast days. And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them. Be-hold this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and my preface unto the book of my com-mandments, which I have giventhem to publish unto you, O, inhab-ants of the earth. Wherefore, fearand tremble, Oh, ye people, for what I the Lord have decreed in them shall be fulfilled * * Where-fore I the Lord, knowing the calam-ity which should come upon the in-habitants of the earth, called uponmy servant Joseph SmithJun'r, and spake unto himfrom heaven, and gave him com-mandments; and also gave com-mandments to others, that theyshould proclaim these things untothe world; and all this that it mightbe fulfilled which was written bythe Prophets." [##Doctrine and Covenants 1:17-18##] Again, the Lordhas said, "Behold, now it is calledto-day (until the coming of the Sonof Man), and verily it is a day of sac-rifice and a day for the tithing of mypeople; for he that is tithed shall not be burned (at his coming) * * and I will not spare any that remainin Babylon. Wherefore, if ye be-lieve me, ye will labor while it is called to-day." [##Doctrine and Covenants 64:23-25##] This is the word of the Lord to the Elders of Israel. And I say the same to the Latter-day Saints. It is no light thing forany people in any age of the world to have a dispensation of the gospel of Jesus Christ committed intotheir hands, and when a dispensa-tion has been given, those receivingit are held responsible before high heaven for the use they make of it.I feel to back up the testimonygiven to us this forenoon by Presi-dent Taylor. I have had the same feelings resting upon me for the lastyear of my life. I feel that our con-dition, our position, the responsibili-ty we hold, the relationship we sus-tain to God, and the relationship we sus-tain to this great and last dispen-sation—I feel that many of us, asLatter-day Saints, hold too lightly these important trusts committed to our charge. The angel of God, as declared to St. John, the Revelator,while upon the Isle of Patmos, hadcome forth in the last days, flying through the midst of heaven, hav-ing the everlasting gospel to preachto them that dwell upon the earth,and to every nation, kindred, tongueand people, saying with a loudvoice, Fear God and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgmentis come. [##Revelation 14:7##] This gospel was commit-ted to Joseph Smith, and connected with this gospel was the proclama-tion, "Fear God, and give glory toHim; for the hour of His judgment is come." [##Joseph Smith-History 1:44-45##] This was the position is which Joseph Smith was placed when he was in the flesh; itwas the position of those that were connected with him, his brotherHyrum, and others of his father's house, as well as the Twelve Apostles, the Seventies and those early Elders of Israel who were called to make the proclamation of this pospel to the world. They weresustained by the power of God. They were called and commandedto go forth into the world and preachthis gospel to the inhabitants of the earth, without purse or scrip. This is the manner we travelled in earlydays. The early Elders of theChurch were called to pass througha great deal. Joseph Smith himself,from the hour that he received therecords from the hand of Moroni, and commenced to proclaim the re-storation of the gospel, to the day of is death, had to suffer tribulation. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##] The whole world arose against him—priest and people. What was the matter? Simply that Joseph Smith[was like other prophets and apos-tles. He brought forth a dispensa-tion of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,] which came in contact with the traditions of the people—traditionsthat have been handed down fromgeneration to generation. He wasthe first man since the day the Savior was put to death, and the apostles and the priesthood takenhome to God—he was the first and only man that ever attempted to establish the gospel of Jesus Christ according to the ancient order ofthings. But he was sustained inhis work. He knew very well when he undertook to introduce this gospel that it would be unpopular,his brethren knew this also; but be-ing called of God, and a dispensation of the gospel having been commit-ted to his hands and the hands of his brethren, the gospel had to bepreached.This is our condition to-day. O ye Elders of Israel who have receiv-ed the holy priesthood, we have this work laid upon our shoulders, we have to take hold and build up this kingdom or be damned. This is our condition; we cannot getaway from it; the ancient Apostles could not; we cannot. It is thegreatest dispensation God ever gave to the human family in any age of the world, and we are commanded to carry it forward. We cannot af-ford to treat lightly this work. Wecannot undertake to serve God and mammon. We cannot undertaketo serve the world and fulfil our missions as Apostles and Elders ofthe Lord Jesus Christ. We havegot to take one side or the other.And I will also say we cannot befruitful in the things of the kingdomof God except we are diligent in searching for the things of God. Itis our duty to do so. We have beencalled by the spirit of revelation, bythe voice of God from heaventhrough the mouth of his prophets, to preach the gospel and build upthis kingdom. This is the word ofthe Lord unto us. The Lord said in the beginning, some fifty years ago, in the first revelation almost thatwas given to us, that the harvest was ripe, and that whosoever would thrust in his sickle and reap thesame is called of God.I have given you my views andfeelings with regard to these things. I have my faith, my hope. I be-lieve that God Almighty reserved a certain class of men to carry on his work. They have been born into the world in this generation. I be-lieve this was the case with JosephSmith. I believe he was ordainedto this work before he tabernacledin the flesh. He was a literal de-scendant of Joseph who was sold in-to Egypt, and the Lord called himand ordained him. He gave untohim the keys of the kingdom. Hereceived the record of the stick ofJoseph from the hands of Ephraimto stand with the Bible, the stick ofJudah, in the last days as a power to gather the twelve tribes of Israelbefore the coming of Shiloh, theirKing. [##2 Nephi 3:7-15##]We have been under the necessityof carrying this gosoel to the gene-ration in which we live. The Lordhas never sent judgments upon any generation that we have any know-ledge of until he has raised up pro-phets and inspired men to warn theinhabitants of the earth. This is the course the Lord has dealt with all men from the days of FatherAdam to the present time.I need not stop to tell you that welive in a day of darkness, wickedness,unbelief, and transgressions of everykind; I need not tell you this; the heavens know it, the earth knows it, the devils know it, all men know itthat are acquainted with the human family in the day and age in whichwe live. The Lord told us fifty yearsago, that "Darkness covereth the earth, and gross darkness the mindsof the people; and all flesh has be-come corrupt before my face." [##Doctrine and Covenants 112:23##] ButHe has sent forth the warning voiceto them. He has called upon allmen to repent and obey the gospelof Jesus Christ, that they may becounted worthy to escape the judge-ments of God.President Taylor treated this forenoon upon the law of Tithing. Per-haps the Latter day Saints do notwant to hear much more upon this subject; but I have felt a long time that we as a people were somewhatignorant of that law. We have looked upon it as a matter of little conse-quence; we have looked upon it witha great deal of indifference whether we pay tithing or not. But the sub-ject was clearly set forth this fore-noon by President Taylor. He hasno power to change this law, norhas any other man; and if we donot obey it, we can lay no claim tothe promises made to those who obey it. These things are very [plain and pointed. The principle of]tithing has been a principle of [sacri-]fice in almost every age of the world;in fact, it was peculiarly so amongthe people in ancient days, andamong even the heathen nations ofthe earth. Now I have thoughtmany times that some of those an-cient kings that were raised uphad in some respects more re-gard for the carrying out of someof these principles and lawsthan even the Latter-day Saintshave in our day. I will take as an ensample Cyrus, on account of histemperance. He was one of thekings of the Medes and Persians. I believe his father was a Persian andhis mother a Mede. To trace thelife of Cyrus from his birth to hisdeath, whether he knew it or not itlooked as though he lived by inspi-ration in all his movements. He began with that temperance and virtue that would sustain any Chris-tian country or any Christian king.And even when he was sent in hisyouth to his grandfather Astyages,the king of the Medes, he showed that he had been carefully brought up, and he followed his early train-ing in a great measure throughouthis life; while as king or leader ofthe Median armies, he conquerednearly the whole world, in fact I do not know that he ever lost a battle. His grandfather was living in lux-ury, and when young Cyrus was sent to him he offered to serve him as a butler—only he didn't do as butler's sometimes do—that is, taste the wine before putting it on the table. Cyrus, when offered wine, said, "I am afraid it is poison." "You are afraid it is poison?" "What makesyou think it is poison?" "Why, becauae I have seen it make you and some of the princes act very strange,you would stagger and act very cu-rious." He followed this principleof temperance during his whole life.Before a battle he offered sacrifices to the Gods; when he finished a battleand had a victory he did the same thing. I have been struck in read-ing his history with the course hetook in this matter. He would never enter into revelry or debauch-ery over the nations he had con-quered. He taught such principles until the day of his death. Beforehe died he told those by whom hewas surrounded, that he did not want his body put into a gold coffinor a silver coffin; he simply desired his body to be laid in the dust and covered with the earth. Many of these principles followed him, and I have thought many of them wereworthy, in many respects, the at-tention of men who have the gospelof Jesus Christ. But the law oftithing was carried out by all Israelfrom the creation of the world down to the present time—that is, when-ever God had a people upon theearth they observed the law oftithing. And I believe, as President Taylor has stated, that it is our dutyto pay our tithes and offerings beforethe Lord. It is a commandment of the Lord that we should do this, and I do not feel myself called upon as amember of this church and kingdomto require the President of this Church to attempt to change this order, or attempt to find fault withhim because he does not permit young men who curse and swear,who do not pay their tithing, etc., to enter the Lord's house and there have sealed upon their heads thehighest blessings that were ever given to Patriarchs and Prophets, who have sealed their testimony with their blood. He has told theBishops and Presidents of Stakes not to give recommends to young men or old men, or anybody else, who do not obey the laws of God inthis respect, and I feel to back himup in this matter, for I know he will be justified before the Lord. If we attempt to please the world on theone hand and serve the Lord on the other, we will fail.I feel to say to my brethren whohave received the holy priesthood:We occupy a position in the worldthat is of great importance to us. We have received the teachings ofheaven; in fact, I believe there never was a people since God madethe world, who received more teach-ings than the Latter-day Saints, forthe last fifty years. The world hasrejected the light of truth, and thefulness of the gentiles will come in. But it is our duty to preach the gos-pel to them until the Lord says, "It is enough." We must round up ourshoulders and bear off this kingdom.The Lord compared the kingdom of heaven to ten virgins; five were wise and five were foolish; five hadoil in their lamps and five had not. [##Matthew 25:1-13##]Now the question is, how can wekeep oil in our lamps? By keeping the commandments of God, remem-bering our prayers, do as we are toldby the revelations of Jesus Christ, [and otherwise assisting in] buildingup Zion. When we are laboring forthe kingdom of God we will have oilin our lamps, our light will shineand we will feel the testimony ofthe spirit of God. On the other hand, if we set our heart upon thethe things of the world and seek forthe honors of men, we will walk in the dark and not in the light. If we do not value our Priesthood and aad the work of this Priesthood, the building up of the kingdom of God,the rearing of temples, the redeem-ing of our dead, and the carrying out of the great work unto whichwe have been ordained by the Godof Israel—if we do not feel that these things are more valuable tous than the things of the world, we will have no oil in our lamps,no light, and we shall fail to bepresent at the marriage supper ofthe Lamb.I have felt for a good while thatwe required stiring up with regardto the law of tithing and otherthings. The question is here: Ifthis is the work of God and the Lord has given us commandments, will we be blessed in obeying thesecommandments. The Lord holds our destiny in his hands. The earth, the riches of the earth, the crops, the herds, or flocks, our food and raiment are all the gifts of God tous.Of course, we are required to prac-tise what we preach. I believe inthat doctrine. Now, I know for my-self that the Presidency of thisChurch pay their tithing. As chair-man of the Auditing Committee, I know what their tithing is. The Twelve Apostles pay their tithing.Bishop Hunter and his Counselorspay their tithing, as well as a great many others in this Church and Kingdom. Iwould not preach tithing if I did not pay it. I consider it my duty topay my tithing. I consider it is a law of God to me, and I am nopoorer for obeying it. I wish mybrethren and sisters to take thisprinciple to heart. As the President has said, the Lord does not care anything about our cattle, our gold and our silver. The law of tithing is alaw of God to us. Obedience is bet-ter than sacrifibe. We are building temples to the name of the Lord. What are we building them for? That we may enter in and redeem our dead. The Lord has had his en-dowments a great many years ago. He has ascended to his thrones, principalities and powers in theeternities. We are his children. Hehas given us a law, and he has plac-ed us here on the earth to obey thatlaw. We are here to fill a probationand receive an education, I onceread a man's view of education—he was not a Mormon, but a man ofthe world—who said, "No man isfully educated unless he can tell where he came from, why he is here, and where he is going to." That being the case, I thought there were few fully educated in the world. No man can tell where hecame from unless it is re-vealed to him. We havehad these things revealed to usin the Bible, Book of Mormon,and Book of Doctrine and Covenants.We have thus come to the know-ledge that we had an existence be-fore we came here, and that we had a probation before we came here. We are now upon our second estate, and our eternal destiny depends up-on the few years we spend in theflesh. We are placed here that itmay be seen which law we willkeep. Our Heavenly Father hasplaced before us the laws celestial,telestial and terrestial. If any manwill obey the celestial law, he will be preserved by that law; all theglory, power and exaltation, belong-ing to that law, will be given to him. What does the Savior, theSon of God, say to us in our Testa-ment? He says, in speaking of the Priesthood of Melchisedek, that"they who receive this Priesthoodreceiveth me, saith the Lord; for he that receiveth my servants, receiv-eth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth my Father; and he thatreceiveth my Father, receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore, allthat my Father hath shall be givenunto him; and this is according tothe oath and covenant which be-longeth to the Priesthood. There-fore, all those who receive thePriesthood, receive this oath andcovenant of my Father, which hecannot break, neither can it bemoved." [##Doctrine and Covenants 84:35-40##] Who in the name of theLord can apprehend such lan-guage as this? Who can comprehend that, by obeying the celestial law, all that our Father has shall be givenunto us—exaltations, thrones princi-palities, power, dominion—who cancomprehend it? Nevertheless it ishere stated. How few there are onthe earth to-day, or in any other dis-pensation, who have been able toabide the celestial law of God. Itbrings down the hatred of the wholegeneration in which we live. No man can live the celestial law withoutbringing upon his head persecution. It cost the Savior his life; he suffer-ed an ignominious death upon thecross. Joseph Smith sealed his tes-timony with his blood, as also haveothers connected with this Church and kingdom.Now, our position is this: We havebeen chosen out of the world, the world hate us, our nation hates us, indeed the inhabitants of the earthin a great measure hate us. Of course there are honorable excep-tions. But a great many despise us;a great many wish our destruction.Why? Because we are trying toabide the celestial law of God; weare preaching the gospel of JesusChrist and endeavoring to carry out its principles. Now the question is,will it pay us to do so? Will it payus to be faithful? Will it pay us to pass through whatever trials or af-flictions, or persecutions, or evendeath itself for the kingdom of God, for salvation and eternal life,the greatest of all gifts that God can bestow on the children of men? I say it will, and I [h]ope that the Latter-day Saints,that all men in authority—that we will all be faithful before the Lord, that we will remember our prayers,labor for the Holy Spirit, labor to know the mind and will of God, thatwe may know the path to walk in, that we may obtain the spirit of theLord and the Holy Ghost, and thatwe may overcome the world andmagnify our calling till we get through this probation. There is along time hereafter. Our aim is high. There are a few in this gene-ration who have attemsted to keepthe celestial law. I desire to keepthat law, so that when I have finish-ed my probation here I may get intothe presence of my Heavenly Fath-er, where our Savior is, where theold patriarchs and prophets are,weere Joseph Smith and his breth-ren the Apostles and those who have lived faithful unto the day of theirdeath are. That is my desire, and I say I desire this for myself, I de-sire the same for my family.I pray God my Heavenly Father, to let His blessings rest upon us; Ipray that his Holy Spirit may be with us to guide us in the path weshould walk in; I pray that we may magnify our calling and overcomethe world, the flesh and the devil, and inherit eternal life, for Christ'ssake. Amen

 Christ, upon the Holy Ghost, the tes-timony of the Father and the son. This power has been with us. That is why we are here today. That is why this Tabernacle stands here today, in ful-fillment of the predictions of the pro-phets of God in ancient days. It is why the Zion of God is planted here inthese valleys of the mountains. It has all been by the power of God, and notof man.I hope we may contemplate our posi-tion, and realize the condition we are in and the obligations we are under to God. I feel thankful that I have the privilege of meeting with the Latter-day Saints. I have met with this peo-ple nearly all my life when I have hadthe opportunity. I embraced the Gospelthe first sermon I ever heard. That was in 1833. From that day till thisI have rejoiced in the Gospel of Christ, and in meeting with the Latter-day Saints, wherever my lot has been cast. I came to these valleys with the Pio-neers, led by President Young. He finished his work, as Joseph Smith finished his. But President Younglabored more years than was the lot of Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith, how-ever, labored long enough to performthe work that he was ordained to. Heorganized the Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints in the earth—a thing that all the nations under heaven could not have done. There was noman on earth could have done that, only by the power of God. JosephSmith was the man appointed and called of God, and he was a noble man;yes, a glorious man, a man filled with the wisdom and power of God. His life was short, but see what he did dur-ing that time! During the fourteen years he labored for God in the fleshhe brought forth more than any other man that ever lived, excepting the Sa-vior. The organization of the Church itself was one of the most glorious works a man ever had the privilege ofperforming among the sons of men.Then he brought forth the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, containing the revelations of God to us. Well, he laid down his life for the word of God andtestimony of Jesus Christ. He was martyred. His brother Hyrum wasmartyred. Christ was martyred. His Apostles were martyred. Several havebeen martyred in these last days, be-sides the Prophet.We should not forget these things.Let us labor faithfully and pray untothe Lord for wisdom day by day, that we may have power to conquer and overcome. When I get through I want to go where the Savior is, wherethe Prophet is, and where our people are that have gone who have been true and faithful. If I miss that, I miss the object of my creation; and so will any other man who hasreceived the Gospel. We shouldbe very careful what we do, and watchover ourselves and our course in life, that we may be justified when we get through.I want to ask this congregation a question. Can you point me to any emperor, king, priest, denomination orpower on the face of the whole earth,outside of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who has power to go forth and redeem one of their dead? There never was a soul any-where that could do this until God or-ganized His Church upon the earth. One of the leading principles withJoseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff, and the Apostles and leading men of this Church, has been the redemption of their dead. The Lord said He wouldraise up saviors in the last days uponMount Zion while the kingdom should be the Lord's. This is a duty restingupon all Israel, and one that we should comprehend. The signers of theDeclaration of Independence and themen that laid the foundation of this great American government know full well that there has not been a power on the earth where they could applyto have this principle carried out intheir behalf, only the Apostles that held the keys of the kingdom of God in this generation. They have gone to them and plead with them to redeem them because there was no other pow-er on earth could do it, and this hasbeen accomplished. This principle istoday with the Latter-day Saints. There is no more glorious principlegiven to man than the power whichyou have while holding the Priesthood,to go forth and redeem your fathers, your mothers, your progenitors. It willstand with you in the morning of the resurrection. Such principles are wor-thy of contemplation. There is no manliving that can point to any church orpeople that have this power on the earth, but the Latter-day Saints. Whether the world believe it or not, it is true. I remember very well the first word that was given to us by the Prophet Joseph Smith after we returned from our mis-sion in England. He called us to-gether and told us that the Lord had revealed to him a principle wherebywe could go forth and redeem our dead. It was like a shaft of light from the throne of God to our hearts. It opened a field wide as eternity to our minds. The first thing that entered into mymind was that I had a mother in thespirit world. She died when I was 14 months old. I never knew a mother. I thought to myself, Have I power to go forth and seal my mother to myfather? The word was, yes. Well,I attended to that, and to everythingelse, with the help of my friends, un-til I have thousands of my dead rela-tives on the list that I have redeemed. These are blessings the world do notcomprehend. We should lay this toheart and not neglect this work. I do not want to go into the spirit worldand meet with my progenitors who never heard the Gospel in their day and generation, and have them tell me, "You held in your hand the power to go forth and redeem me, and you havenot done it." I do not want to meet that. I do not want the Latter-day Saints to meet it. I think we are do-ing pretty well. We have four tem-ples reared in these valleys of the mountains, and they are fairly welloccupied by the Latter-day Saints. But we want to continue this until we have redeemed all within our power toredeem. If we will carry this prin-ciple out, we will have the blessing of it. It will be with us in the morningof the resurrection, when our fathersand mothers and our progenitors come up with us because we have redeemedthem. Jesus Himself went and preached to the spirits in prison, that they mightbe judged according to men in theflesh, but live according to God in the spirit. That principle was manifest in that day; it is with us today.Brethren and sisters, you have my faith, you have my blessings, and mydesire for your welfare. I want to seeZion arise, and the glory of God restupon her. I have faith to believe that what has been promised concerning this people, and concerning our poster-ity, will be fulfilled. The Lord will not desert Zion. It will continue to growand increase and have power in the earth, until the coming of the Son of Man. We have been called to this work. It will rest upon our shoulders, andafterwards upon the shoulders of our children, as those raised up throughthe loins of Abraham, Isaac and Jacobin former times. God bless you, andgive us all wisdom to guide and directus. This is my prayer, in the name ofJesus Christ. Amen.

 the dead, and thus open the prisondoors and set the prisoners free!The Lord is no respecter of persons, and the fifty thousand millions of human beings who are supposed tohave lived on the earth from the days the ancient servants of Godwere put to death, to the restora-tion of the gospel through JosephSmith, never having had the privi-lege of hearing the gospel, are notgoing to remain in the eternalworld without the privilege of hear-ing the gospel; but they will bepreached to by Joseph Smith andthe prophets, patriarchs and elders who have received the priesthood on the earth in these latter days. Many of them will receive theirtestimony, but somebody must ad-minister for them in the flesh, thatthey may be judged according tomen in the spirit, and have part in the first resurrection, just the sameas though they had heard the gos-pel in the flesh. The Lord has re-vealed this to us, and commandedus to attend to this duty, the same as Jesus, while his body was in thegrave, preached three days andnights to the spirits in prison whowere rebellious during the long-suffering of God in the days of Noah. [##1 Peter 3:18-20##]They lay in prison until Jesuswent and preached to them.This and every other principlewhich the elders of this churchpreach and teach are from heaven—the Lord has revealed them. Theyare before the world, and all whohear them will investigate if theyare wise.  If there is a man on theface of the earth who has got a true principle that we have not, will heplease let us have it? As PresidentYoung has said many a time, we will change a dozen errors for onetruth, and thank God for it. Weare after light and truth. We are not afraid of the doctrines of theinhabitants of the earth being pre-sented before us or our children. We have truth, we have beencalled to present it to the world. We have done it. If they have truths that we have not we would like to obtain them.I will say by way of conclusionthat I thank God for the privilegeof attending these conferences forso many years, and for seeing the increase and progress of his work.Here we meet from every nationunder heaven, just as the prophets said. We have been gathered bythe gospel of Jesus Christ.  I hadthe privilege, last night and this morning, of meeting with Father Kington, the old patriarch whom I met with over in Herefordshire, England, where, like John the Baptist, he was a fore-runner of thegospel of Christ. [##Luke 1:76##] Through his ad-ministrations the people in that county had been prepared to receivethe gospel, and when we went and preached to them, he and all hisflock but one, numbering six hun-dred, entered into the kingdom,and that opened a door whichenabled us to baptize eighteenhundred in about seven months' labor. I never expected to see himagain in this city, but he came to my house last night, and he cameto meeting to-day, and I felt morepride and joy in meeting him than I should if it had been the Emperorof Russia. I thank God that I havethe privilege of meeting with theSaints with whom I ate and drank in foreign lands, who have listenedto the voices of the elders of Israel,have received their testimonies, have been baptized for the remis-sion of sins, and received the testi-mony of the Holy Ghost.Brethren and sisters, we are inthe school of the Saints. Let us progress, and try to improve andset our hearts on the things of God and truth, and carry out and do the work of righteousness for Jesus' sake, Amen.

 Bilious nature, I suggested to him that I thought it would be best for him to go to Scandinavia he answeredthat he would be very pleased to go to his native countryif the Presidency were willing to make the change. hisFather was one of our canadian settlers as Cardston, andan excellent good Man. "and died there." and upon hisdeath bed he wished me to watch over this boy and hissisters & urge upon them to attend to their work in the Temple. Prest. Geo Q. Cannon will very likely remember him, as theywere in the Pen together. Bro F. M. Lyman also, hisname was Hans J. Petersen.My reasons for making the suggestion are these, that while laboring there he can gather up Genealogiesof the families of His Father & Mother, famalies andalso recruit his health. it will cost much more moneyto take him to Scandinavia than to Indian Territory, butthe money will be forthcoming for him to go any timein October that you may wish.and if you need one in his place for Indian Territory, I would suggest the names of Niels Gyllenskog Jun. andHarper Hill, both of SmithfieldRespectfully your Bro in the GospelGeo L.
