I composed myself  for sleep but could not sleep. I felt a strange stupor  come over me and apparently became partially  Unconscious. Still I was not asleep, nor awoke  With a strange far away dreamy feelings the first I recognized was that I was in the Tabernacle  at Ogden sitting on the back seat in the corner for  fear they would call upon me to Preach which  after singing the second time, they did by calling me to  the stand. I arose to speak and said I did not  Know that I had any thing special to say Except to  bear my Testimony to the Truth of the Latter Day work  when all at once it seemed as though I was lifted  out of myself, and I said "yes I have sumthing to  say, it is this– some of my brethren present have been asking me what is coming to pass, what is the wind  blowing up. I will answer you right here what is  coming to pass shortly. I was immediately in, Salt   ENDENTRY  Lake City wandering about the streets in all parts of the  city and on the door of every house I found a badge of mourning, and I could not find a house but what  was in mourning. I passed by my own house and  saw the same sigm there, and asked "Is that me  that is dead" Sumthing gave me answer "No  youll live through it all" It seemed strange to me that I saw no person on the street in my wandering about through the City, they seemed to be in their houses  with their sick and Dead. I saw no funeral possess- ion, or any thing of that kind, but the city looked  vary still and quiet as though the people were praying and had controll of the desease what ever it was I then looked in all directions over the Territory, East  West North and South, and I found the same mourn- ing in every place throughout the Land. The next  I knew I was Just this side of Omaha. It seemed  as though I was above the Earth, looking down to it  as I passed along on my way East and I saw the  roads full of people principally women with just  what they could carry in bundles on the travelling to the mountains on foot, and I wond- ered how they could get there, with nothing but  a small pack upon their backs. It was remarkable  to me that there were so few men among them, it  did not seem as though the cars were running the rails looked rusty, and the road abandoned, And  I have no conception how I travelled myself   ENDENTRY  As I looked down upon the people I continued Eastward  through Council Bluffs which were  full of disease, and women every whare The States  of Illinois were in turmoil and strife, Men killing each other, and women joining in the  fight, family against family cutting each other to  p saw was Washington, and I found the City a Desolation. The white House Empty, the Halls of Con- gress the same. Every thing in ruins, the people  seemed to have fled from the city and left it to  take care of itself. I was next in the city of Baltimore  and in the square whare the Monument of  stands, in front of St Charles and other Hotels  I saw the Dead piled up so high as to fill the square I saw Mothers cut the throats of their own  children for the sake of their blood, which they  drank from their veins, to quench their thirst  and then lie down and die. The waters of the Chesapeake and of the city were so stagnant and such a stench arose from them on account of  the putrefaction of Dead bodies that the vary smell caused Death, and that was singular again  I saw no man except they were dead, lying in  the streets, and vary few women, and they  were crazy mad, and in a dying condition Every whare I went I beheld the same all over  the city, And it was horrible beyound description   ENDENTRY  to look at. I thought this must be the End. But No  I was seemingly in Philadelphia and there every-  thing was still no living soul was to be seen to greet  me, and it seemed as though the whole City was  without an inhabitant. In chestnut  street and in fact Every whare I went the putrifcation of the Dead bodies caused such a stench that it was  Impossible for any creature to Exhist alive, nor did  I see any living thing in the City. I next found  myself in Broadway New York and here it  seemed the people had done their best to overcome  the Disease. But in wandering down Broadway  I saw the bodies of Beautiful women lying stone  dead, and others in a dying condition on the side  walk. I saw men crawl out of the cellars and  rob the dead bodies of the valuables they had on and before they could return to their coverts in the  cellars they themselves would roll over a time or  t I saw Mothers kill their own children and  Eat raw flesh and then in a few minuts  die themselves. Whareever I went I saw the  same scenes of Horror and Desolation rapine and  Death. No Horses or carriages, No busses  or street cars, but Death and Destruction evry whare I then went to the Grand Central Park and looking back I saw a fire start and just at that moment a mighty East wind sprang up and carried the flames   ENDENTRY  West over the City, and it burned untill there was  not a single building left standing whole Even down to the wharfs, and the shiping all seemed to be burned and swallowed up in the common destruction  and left Nothing but a Desolation whare the great  City was a short time before. The stench from the  bodies that were burning was so great that it was  carried a great distance across the Hudson River and bay, and thus spread d reever the flames penetrated. I cannot paint in  words the Horror that seemed to Encompass me around It was beyound description or thought of  to conceive. I supposed this was the End but I was  here given to understand, that the same horror  was being enacted all over the country. North  South East and West, that few were left alive still there were some. Immediately after I  seemed to be standing on the west bank of the  Independance  but I saw no city I saw the whole states of Miss- ouri &amp; Iowa were a com- plete wilderness with no living human being im them. I then saw a short distance from the river  Twelve men dressed in the robes of the Temple standing  in a square or nearly so. I understood it resprese- nted the Twelve gates of the New Jerrusalem, and  they were with hands uplifted consecrating the ground  and laying the Corner Stones. I saw myriads   ENDENTRY  of Angels hovering over them and around about them  and also an immens pillar of a cloud over them  and I heard the singing of the most beautiful music the  words "Now is esstablished the Kingdom of our God  and his Christ and He shall reign forever and  Ever, and the Kingdom shall never be Thrown down for the Saints have overcome" and I saw  people coming from the River and different places  a long way off to help build the Temple, and it seemed  that the Hosts of the angels also helped to get the material to build the Temple, and I saw some come who  wore their Temple  Temple and the City and all the time I saw the  great pillar of cloud hovering over the place Instantly I found I was in the Tabernacle at  Ogden yet I could see the building going on and  got quite animated in calling to the people in the  Tabernacle to listen to the beautiful music that the  Angels were Making. I called to them to look at the Angels as the House seemed to be full of them  and they were saying the same words that I  heard Before "Now is the Kingdom of Our God  Esstablished forever &amp; Ever." and then a voice said  "Now shall come to pass that which was spoken by Isaiah the Prophet "That seven women shall take hold of one man  saying &amp;c" {##Isaiah 4:1##. At this time I seemed to stagger back from the  pulpit &amp; F D Richards and some one els caught me and prevented  me from falling when I requested Brother Richards to   ENDENTRY  apologise to the audience for me because I stoped  so adruptly and tell them I had not fainted  but was exhausted I rolled over in my bed  and heard the City Hall clock strike Twelve    ENDENTRY June 16, 1878    wrote one to him to day &amp; 29.
