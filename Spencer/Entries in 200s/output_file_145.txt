Soon men and dogs were on the ground from Camp but it became dark and the dogs would not follow and we gave up the chase I was 20 rods from the Brethren when the bear attacked them and did not see it. There were two antilope killed to day and a Frenchman 18 mile that was travelling in Company with us shot a vary fat buffalo cow and distributed a good share of it in our camp which was excellent eating there was also two buffalo bulls killed today    ENDENTRY September 19, 1847 ~ Sunday   19th Sunday. Early this morning a company of hunters crossed the river to get some buffalo cows in a herd near by, in the chase Br  Mathews horse fell with him but did not hurt him, the others continued  on and killed one cow and two black tailed deer while this was going on the Twelve with many others went up the creek to see if they could get the bears but we could not find them I came in sight of 3 deer and shot 3 times at them with a coarse sighted rifles and shot over them evry time Brother Barnham shot one of them I went a little above and saw about 50 Antilope in a flock feeding on the plain I got within 30 rods of one of them and shot him dead in his tracks I brought  my horse up to put him onto his back to pack him into Camp and I laboured hard one hour before I could get the horse willing to let me  put the animal on his back I was 5 miles from camp and walked and led my horse in the antilop was fat. We then harnessed up and drove 9 miles and camped on Fourchebaise Creek 9 miles    ENDENTRY September 20, 1847 ~ Monday   20th We travled 30 miles we crossed dry creek, little timber, and camped Big timber, did not get through untill 9 oclok at night had great difficulty in finding grass as the other camps had eat it off. A boy by the name of Judson Persons did not get into Camp but lay out 10 miles from camp. 30 miles FIGURE    ENDENTRY September 21, 1847 ~ Tuesday   21st A cloudy morning. At about 9 oclock the call was made to  get up the horses. I started for the horses which was in the timber about half a mile from Camp I got about two thirds of the way to the horses when one of the most exciting seenes wcommenced I ever witnessed I herd the report of several ^guns^ in quick succession and herd the guard cry   ENDENTRY Indians, Indians, And in less than a minute the timber and bluffs were lined  with mounted Indians charging with all speed upon our guard, horses and camp they shot at two or three of the guard but missed them they took one of the guard and tryed to carry him off on a horse. He knocked one of them down with his fist and got away from them some of the Brethren snaped their guns at them but they did not go off, as soon as I herd the report of the guns, and the cry of Indians and saw  them driving off our horses and gathering thick and fast upon every hand and being without either horse or arms I run to the camp with  all speed and gave the alarm and called upon all to gather their arms and mount their horses. Brothers Mathews, and ^99^ several others sprung onto their horses with their guns and pistols and run to stop the horses which the Indians were taking away one party of  Indians had driven 5 or 6 Horses and Mules over the Hills Br Kimball took after them. two Indians had gone over the Bluff with my Horse and Mule Brother Rockwood took after them. At the same time about 20 horses came rushing toward Camp which the Indians had frightend Br Young with great exhertion with the assistance of one or two other Brethren succeding in stoping them and getting them into camp. As soon as I arived in camp I opened my trunk  took out my belt containing 8 pistol shots and harnessed it onto myself as quick as possible put a saddle and bridle onto a broken down horse for the want of a better one and I mounted without  spur or whip and started for the chase after my own horses. I  could not travel vary fast over the rough ground and bluffs on a  poor horse but I went as fast as I could. As soon as I left camp I began to rise the bluffs I saw Indians gathering thicker and faster upon every hand and began to close in between me and the camp. As I passed by one Indian he was priming his gun. But I continued the chase As soon as my horse and mule got over their fright and got out of  sight of camp, they tryed to return to camp and troubled the Indians  about driving them and Brother Rockwood soon came near  them and one stoped and met him when they found they were overtaken and professed friendship the other still tried to drive off the horses Br Rockwood fired a pistol at him and he run and left the horses and the other Indian left also and Rockwood son soon started my  horses towards ^me^ I soon came up to his assistance and some other Brethren also came up and assisted me in ketching them and while I was doing this near 40 Indians surrounded Br Kimball who started for the other horses. some of the Brethren started to his assistance after I had started for camp with my horses. Indians were also upon evry side of me untill I got into camp I secured my horses insid the camp and by this time about 150 warriors had gatherd to gether close to our camp all dressed in the greatest stile for a war charge and the old chif began to address to the top of his horse voice the Indians and also our camp, tlelling us they were good Sioux and  they thought we were Crows or snakes. When they found they could not get any more of our horses and 3 had been retaken which they stole they then  professed friendship there was 11 horses taken by the Indians they number ed at about 200 warriors on the ground and well mounted and their was not over 20 of our men including the guard that was engaged in any way in stoping the horses, or saving them, or retaking those that were stolen. Br Gould  took one Indian horse and all and another Indian brought back Thomas  Woolsays horse which was among the stolen and exchanged him for the Ind ians horse, this with my two horses were the ownly ones retaken during the skirmish. But when the Indians gatherd before the camp they saw we   ENDENTRY as a body were armed and that we knew them and had fed them and treated  them kindly while on our way to the valley. the old Chief then proposed  that we smoke the pipe of peace. And also said that if our chief pointing  to President Young would go to their Camp they would smoke with him and give him up the horses which his men had taken but Brother Young did  not feel well and we did not think it prudent for him to go, while in this  conversation Br Kimball who had been out on the chase after the horses  returned bare headed (having droped his hat) was accompanied by Br Benson  and in riding into camp rushed his horse through the midst of the Indians  and they fearing some treachery or that he was an enemy coming upon them  in their rear, they instantly leaped upon their horses, scattered and rushed from  the camp some runing into the creek all appeared in great fright. But as soon  as they saw there was no evil at hand they returned and took their places and  had a harty laugh at their fright. Br Kimball volenteered to accompanied  the Chief into his camp in the place of Br Young that we might get our  horses I volunteered and also Stephen Markham to go with Br Kimball on the expedition so we three mounted our horses and set out accompanied  by a Frenchman (who could speak a little sioux language) and the Indians to  find their Camp; they told us it was one mile we travled 7 miles over  Bluffs and valleys and came in sight of their Camp some 3 miles from us  moving towards us. so we called a halt and waited for them to come up they came and pitched about 100 lodges and their was about 600 Indians  many women and children and they brought with them about 1000 horses and  mules nearly all of them we supposed were stolen from emigrants and  and other tribes. their encampment presented quite a grand, interesting and amusing  scenery among their horses we readily discoverd ours which was stolen  the night we camped we camped with Br Grants Company we lost  49 that night which they had among their number. The old Chief called  the war Chiefs and placed them on his left hand and ourselves on his right and set down  upon the grass and filled a long pipe with Kennickenick and smoked and passed it  to his Chiefs they smoked and passed it to us we also smoked he then pointed to  us to pick out our horses which we undertook to do but found it no easy  task to pick out 7 or 8 horses scattered through one thousand others for  one or two miles up and down the creek however after a laborious search  we got all but two that was stolen this morning. We then spoke to him  about the 49 horses which they had stolen from us before, they ackn owledged they had got the horses and gave us some incouragement of  letting us have them when they got to Laramie but would not let us  have them then they however let us have one of them ownly the brethren brought about 3 bushels of salt as a present to him we then  returned to camp with our horses, which ended the business of the  day the Camp did not move but few rods I travled about 18 m It rained some during the night    ENDENTRY September 22, 1847 ~ Wednesday   22nd A cool rainy morning it seemed to be the equenoxial stomr though not vary tedious we thought it wisdom to leave the ground and  continue our journey we travled 18 miles and camped on Bitter  creek we had but little grass but plenty of water 18 mile    ENDENTRY September 23, 1847 ~ Thursday   23rd we travled to day 30 miles and camped at night at the warm  spring we did not get through untill 9 oclok at night the moon shone most briliantly we took our horses forward to the spring to  water them and then drove our waggons on the South road half a mile.

Appointed 10 men to go and visit the Ind- ians to get the stolen horses and about 40 men to follow after to assist in  case of necessity Br Young gave much instruction upon principle  and improving upon manners, temper, and interest in the general welfare of  the Church and kingdom of God distance of the day 12 m    ENDENTRY September 25, 1847 ~ Saturday   25th The Companies prepared themselves this morning to start on their  expedition. the first company of 10 men commanded y Col Mark- ham started by 9 oclok the other Company numbered 25 men comma nded by Br Kimball went to  the fort it was not long before both companies returned as they ascerta- ined at the fort that a man had gone forward to inform them of  our coming and to have them cash up their horses. we also recieved  word in the evening that Little had returned on the road  back, had fallen in with Comodore Stockton who was from the  Bay of Francisco accompanied with 40 men going to the States Brs Young and Kimball made a purchase of some 40 buffalo robes  which were some damaged and unmerchantable they everaged about  $1.50 each, they also bought 3 cows at $15 each. during the afterno- on I went out on patrool picket guard    ENDENTRY September 26, 1847 ~ Sunday   26th Sunday Brs fort this morn- ing with 2 other Brethren and brought into our camp 10 horses which they had drove on west to meet us with. we were truly glad to  see them and their hosses horses to as they would be some help to us  as theye Indians had taken so many of our horses that we had as much as we could do to get along and our horses are growing  poor daily Brs Kimball and others dined with Comodore  Stockton at the fort I spent the fore part of the day washing  my clothes rubed the skin of my fingers into the flesh we  harnessed up at 3 oclok and drove 3 miles and camped on the platt  many in Camp are out of both bread and meat I have divided  my bread and meat untill I am nearly out myself. 3 m    ENDENTRY September 27, 1847 ~ Monday   27th We travled 8 miles and fed and took breakfast we then travled 12 miles  and camped for the night on the bank of the Platt in the midst of  a plenty of grass and a grove of cottonwood near a good harbor for  both deer and Indians we saw several deer and a large drove of antelope it was a warm plesant day we mowed grass for our horses  to stand by overnight 20 miles    ENDENTRY September 28, 1847 ~ Tuesday   28th we drove 8 miles and took breakfast we saw about 50 Indians mak- ing off towards the bluffs on the South side of the river we drove  12 miles and camped on the Platt 5 miles west of scotts Bluffs 20 m A drove of antilope run through our camp and we killed two of them    ENDENTRY September 29, 1847 ~ Wednesday   29th We passed Scotts Bluffs and took breakfast we saw a large com pany travling on the opposite side of the river we could not tell whether they were Indians or Capt Stockton and Co they pitched their lodges  about 10 miles back of us. we killed one Buffalo Bull to day 22 miles    ENDENTRY September 30, 1847 ~ Thursday   30th we travled 20 miles and camped on the Bank of the Platt  Mr Bewshaw the Indian traider camped on the opposite Bank. of  our Brethren got some meat off him He will come over with his  Indians and surround some buffaloo and kill for uu us in the morning   ENDENTRY October 1, 1847 ~ Friday   OCT 1st 1847 A warm plesant day A good share of the Camp are out of bread and meat and they are preparing to go out to day to surround a herd of buffalo and get some cows a company of Indians came over to go to the hunt and expected us to go with them 2nd we were afterwards informed but we did not go untill several hours afterwards we then went in search of them but found neither Indians or dead buffalo they came in at night and brought some  meat with them for themselves but none for us.

In the evening Br Markham and myself went out to see if we could get any buffalo cows we saw some of the Brethren dressing a young boll which they had killed we could not find any cows and we would not shoot bulls though they came so near me I stoned them off with stones I was quite surprised to see with what expertness the buffalo would clime the mountains and rocks they would go in places whare horned cattle would never think of going, some steps in the rocks in their path was more than 6 feet high in perpendicular rocks. we shot a wolf a deer, stoned a bull and got neither of them and returned to camp 13 m    ENDENTRY October 3, 1847 ~ Sunday   3rd Sunday I lef camp as daylight was appearing in company with Luke Johnson, for the purpose of getting ofsome meat the wolves  that had rent the air through the night with their howls was  dispersing in all directions as we passed along mounted upon our horses they were evry size and couler of their race the beautiful swan in flocks were floating upon the Platt which aded beauty to the scenery, we  soon saw a large herd of buffalo about 6 miles from camp and 2 from  the road. we left our horses and stole upon them the best we could their picket guards were frighted several times we managed to quell their fears. their is no well disiplined Army of men that are more particular to have an old experienced guard on a closs look out than a herd of buffalo. by going under a bank we passed there guards and lay conceled untill we were surrounded and the main bodies of them were coming onto us with a heavy filanxs of bulls meeting us in the face with hundreds of cows follow ing in the rear when they approached within 2 or 3 rods of us we thought it quite time to be up and doing even for our own safety I had a single load in my rifle and a brace of Pistols Br Johnson had a slide of 6 loads in his rifle we rose, he fired twice, I reserved my fire untill he had discharged his two balls, the whole body broke and run from us. He had killed none I fired at a Young cow put a ball through her sholdier but she hobbled over a ridge Johnson mounted a horse and followed a little distance after them I walked over the ridge and shot my  wounded Cow through the hart strings and lungs and she droped dead which was the ownly one we got out of the herd we travled a few miles further and Br antilope all of which  was brought into camp and distributed large herds came near our camp in the evening distance of the day 9 m   ENDENTRY October 4, 1847 ~ Monday   4th Travled 8 miles and nooned the Frenchman had killed 4 fat  cows a part was divided in camp. 4 Sioux came to us, we  travled 8 miles and camped for the night we have seen immensed herds of buffalo through the day near us distance of the day 16 m    ENDENTRY October 5, 1847 ~ Tuesday   5th This morning at day light a company of 10 men was dispatched on foot to overtake the ox teams and stop them untill we should come up as our horses was breaking down from a bo^a^rd stuck in the ground we learned they had stoped 5 days for us and killed and dryed 30 buffalo cows and were still about one week  ahead of us we travled to day 13 miles and camped opposite Ash hollow we have constant fine beautiful weather to journey in the grass is getting dry and not much substance in it and our horses are failing upon it I am thoroughly  convinced that oxen are far preferable to either horses or Mules for such a journey esspecially if they return in the fall distance 13 miles    ENDENTRY October 6, 1847 ~ Wednesday   6th We travled 14 miles and camped on the Bank of the Platt we over- took 2 of the Brethren who went with A Lyman and Co to overtake the Ox teams there was 2 Buffalo Cows and 2 Calves killed to day 14    ENDENTRY October 7, 1847 ~ Thursday    7th It appeared like a cold storm gathering this morning but it sprinkled a little and cleared off we met in the fore part of the day Capt Calafornia)  also Mr Fort Laramie He was quite displeased because Burdeau did not send an interperter and get our horses. They informed us the Mexican war was still continued and that 500 troops would be stationed near Winter quarters untill spring they would then go to the Head of Grand Island and build a fort also one at Green River the pretention for building these forts is said to be for the purpose of protecting the Oregon Emegrants. We sent letters by Capt Walker to the fort Bridger. He informed us that 100 miles south of the Utah lake was an excellent country for farming purposes we continued our journey and camped near a creek on the Platt and  obtained a letter from Wm Clayton one week ahead of us and still going ahead 13    ENDENTRY October 8, 1847 ~ Friday   8th We travled 8 miles and nooned soon after we stoped a large body of animals appered in sight over the Bluff we at first thought it was a band of mounted warriors but by the aid of our glasses we found them to be a band of one hundred or more Elk they made a splended appe- arance they were about one mile from Camp several of us took our guns and went after them they were as large as good sized mules I went up a swail of tall grass the band came within 10 rods of me their horns waveing in the wee air upbove the weeds like Rocking chairs. The Bucks were in advanc as the does were the best this season of the year I drew my gun to my face and waited for one to come in sight. At this instant another man came up behind me and they saw him and broke and run he  shot at them as they run but did no good they ran near a  Frenchman who shot a doe through the neck and he fell dead the ownly one killed out of the band though several shots were made I got a piece of it for my supper the first Elk meat I ever ate we travled 7 miles and camped on the Bank of the Platt we crossed many pure streams of water to day distance 15 m    ENDENTRY October 9, 1847 ~ Saturday   9th We travled 15 miles and camped on Junktion Bluff fork we  had 2 sandy bluffs to cross to day our horses are still failing more and more 15 m   ENDENTRY October 10, 1847 ~ Sunday   10th Sunday The quorum of the Twelve met together and had  a prayer meeting. the camp moved 3 miles in the evening to  better feed. 3 m    ENDENTRY October 11, 1847 ~ Monday   11th we travled 10 miles and camped on the Platt above the Junktion at 3 oclok I went to the Bluff after some Buffalo I got into a large herd and shot a cow but did not fall but went off with the herd. In returning to camp darkness over took me I could not see the camp so I made for the river I had to waid  through swails for 20 rods nearly to my hips in mud and water I passed through the midst of plenty of ducks gees swan and wolves I saw one animal of the cat kind which I took to be a links I struck the platt 4 miles below camp and got in weary hungry and weary and learned that Br Egbert had killed a cow and calf at the Bluffs and a company had gone after them and  could not find the camp had like myself to wallow through the swails we had to raise lights on poles to light them in, one got lost and did not get in untill 10 oclok 10 m    ENDENTRY October 12, 1847 ~ Tuesday   12th I had a question put to me by President Young what my opinion was concerning one of the Twelve Apostles being appointed as the President of the church with his two councellors. I answered that a quorum like the Twelve who had been appointed by revelation and confirmed by revelation from time to time I thought it would require a revelation to change the order of that quorum.* we travled 8 miles and nooned. Br Stillman  shot a buffalo cow I went with my carriage into the Bluffs about 2 miles and we dressed it which took untill near night I shot at 2 calves and got neither of them, we did not get into camp  untill 9 oclok at night and Br Stillman and myself worked untill  1 oclok cutting and salting up meat I got but little sleep 16 m  * Whatever the Lord inspires you to do in this matter I am with you    ENDENTRY October 13, 1847 ~ Wednesday   13th Our horses are failing more and more daily several gave out today we travled 14 miles and camped on the north fork of the Platt we begin to come again to some timber, some buffalo were killed to day and large herds near us 14 m    ENDENTRY October 14, 1847 ~ Thursday   14th We travled 15 miles and camped on the Platt or rather a slew  runing into it, it was cool and windy 15    ENDENTRY October 15, 1847 ~ Friday   15th We travled 14 miles to day and camped on the Platt 14 m nothing of particular interest occured during the day    ENDENTRY October 16, 1847 ~ Saturday   16th we travled to day out of the buffalo range and camped on the Platt. Just before camping our Brethren who had been sent on to over take the ox teams came to us except two continued on they could not gain upon the teams and gave it up. Br Luke Johnson came near being killed by a herd of buffalo travelling in the night. A large herd came upon him suddenly and he was  caught in the midst of thems and could not get out and the herd was some 15 minutes passing him and the ownly way he kept them from treading on him was by hollowing and striking and punching them with his cane on each side of him as they came along and they would open just wide enough for him to stand as they  passed along 15   ENDENTRY October 17, 1847 ~ Sunday   17th Sunday as we had not meat enough to carry our Camp  to winter Quarters it was thought wisdom for a company  of hunters to return back a few miles with some waggons to  the buffalo herds and procure some more meat. Twelve of us  returned back 10 miles with three waggons A Lyman and  myself was among the number, we pitched our camp in  a little timber on a slew of water and we killed two buffalo  during the evening and brought in including buctchers  and teamsters there was about 20 of us and we were all hungry  and after cleaving the body of the meat from the  bones our company roasted the bones, and for our supper  and breakfast we used up the bones of both buffaloes it  is almost incredible what amount of roasted buffalo  meat a hungry man will eat without salt or bread and  not make him sick. there is no other meat known that  a man can eat as much of. The hump bones of a fat  buffalo roasted is the most choice eating of any meat kind  the leg bones are also filled with marrow more choice than  butter and yield a great quantity which we roasted and drank  the melted marrow without bread. We should have made  a delightful picture for an artist to have drawn the scenery  around our fireside. After all had eaten to our full satisfaction  we prepared to make our beds for the night, it was cold and blew  a perfect gale. we made choice of a thicket of willows under a bank  for our lodging place for the night we lay down on the ground and covered  ourselves over with our blankets and robes and had a good nights rest 12.    ENDENTRY October 18, 1847 ~ Saturday   18th At daylight 4 of us went to the Bluffs to exahamine the posit- ion of the herds of buffalo, we saw many both on the Hills and flats  we returned to Camp took our breakfast of roast meat then divi- ded and went out two by two, Luke Johnson went with me about 3  miles from Camp, we came upon 3 wild horses upon the side of the  bluff, they were splendid looking animals but the most wild  of any animals I ever saw.

C. Kimball addressed the Council and said that he had been to the mountains and got an endowment and felt it in his bones and want- ed to talk a little, he said the day had come when iniquity could  not be harboured in the Church, and men because they belong to my family or Br Brigham Youngs family will not be screened in wickedness I wo- uld even turn over to the law of God sons out of my own loins if they done wrong, will I suffer iniquity to go unpunished in others more than in my own sons? I tell you nay. Br Andrews has been adopted into family but let the law of God have its demand upon him if it takes his head off for a man had better ienter into life maimed than into Hell with all his members. The accusations against Br Andrews were then read some he acknowledged to and some were proven against him after which President Young addressed the   ENDENTRY meeting in an interesting manner and gave good teaching. He said a man by seeking that which did not belong to him would loose that which he seemeth to have as in this case Br Andrews by  unlawfully marrying this woman is now left without any wife there is no Elder in this church who has any right to marry a woman to a man who has a living wife, many men act like fools as soon as they get an idea that women should obey their husbands and be passive in their hands they will go to the woods and get a bundle of sticks and com- mence whiping their wives to make them obey them in the first place a husband should be a righteous man a man of God and rule his  houshold in righteousness and govern his wife with kindness and love and not with a rod, club, or his fist, his conduct to his wife should be such that she will love him with all of her heart and he should pray to God that his wife and children which are jewels given him might be saved and not taken from him that not any thing need be lost which the father hath given him. He said that many men through their con- duct would have taken from them that which they had and given to another. He said that when a man had a jewel given to him he ought to prize it and treasure it up and take good care of it and in process of time other jewels might be given him of the Lord, but he should not undertake to  steal them for he could not keep them, and a man should not be in a hurry to obtain any blessing or exhaltation that is not for him and when he has proved himself faithful in all things before God there is no good thing that will be withheld from him in  time or Eternity and many other good instructions were given   President Joseph Young followed with interesting remarks and gave it as his opinion that Br Andrews ought to be cut off from the Church for adultery, most of the quorum of the Twelve  spoke upon the subject also the presidents of the Seventies after which it was moved and carried that Milo Andrews be cut off from the church for adultery. it was also moved and carried  that the woman be cut off from the Church fromor adultery.

The names of the seventies was  then called over and President Young remarked that it would not  be necessary to put them or be organized into quorums while here but  remain in a body under their presidents untill they arived at the valley, that while any quorum of the seventies of twelve were full  though they might be scattered to the fore corners of the earth  would not be filled up in Zion or any place but when there was a vacancy by death or aposticy then the vacancy might be filled we learned from Presidents Youngs teaching that it was necessary to keep up a full organization of the Church through all time  as far as could be at least the three first Presidency quorum of the Twelve Seventies, and Patriarch over the whole Church andc so that the devil could take no advantage of us.   The subject was discused or spoke upon by O. Pratt concerning the appointing of the first Presidency and Patriarch over  the whole Church others spoke upon the subject.

Our Journey to the mountains  and back again to Winters Quarters with horse, mule, and ox teams has been over  2000 miles more than half of the journey we have had to make new roads  and with all of our exposures, sickness, and dangers not a human life has been lost  but all returned in safety and what is more singular still, not a horse mule  ox, cow, or calf was lost either going or returning except 2 horses shot by disobeying  council. The blessing of the Lord has been great upon us as a people during  the past year in all the various portions of the Camp of Israel. we have  now found a place to build a Stake of Zion whare the people can gather  together and build up Zion. The past year has shown forth the fulfi- llment of Prophecy in the wars, rumours of wars, famins, pestilence,  distress of nations with perplexity and in many of the signs of the  times. The United States in their wars with the feble Nation of  Mexico have involved themselve in a debt of one hundred and fifty  millions of dollars besides the loss of twenty five thousand men  and twice that number to Mexico and their own expenses in the war, the  famine has raged in Europe, the breaking  of banks and merchants has distressed the people in England. The Baron  Rothchilds the rich Jew has become a member in the British Parliament  which is a new eary in the History of the Jews, and they the Jews are  gathering home to Jerrusalem by thousands what 1848 will bring to  pass in the History of the Church and Kingdom of God time must  determin and also in the History of the Nations of the Earth.

A. Smith and W Woodruff of the Twelve. G A Smith opened the meeting by prayer and W Woodruff addressed the assembly upon the subject of their being one in all things and the gathering of Israel, building up of Zion, andc. And was followed by President Young who made many good rema rks FIGURE He said the Lord would give his spirit to teach and instruct  from the private member to the President of the church, but he will never give any man or woman his spirit to dictate  and direct his file leader, he related an anacdote of a female  runing a race upon a great wager lost it by stoping on the way  to pick up a Jewel.    He said truly that if we were not one we were not the Lords.   In speaking of the duties of the Priesthood  he said if this people holding the Priesthood should settle down and go to cultivating the earth and entirely neglect the preaching of the gospel the earth would open and swallow them up and hide them from his sight.   The whole day and evening was taken up in teaching and council    ENDENTRY January 17, 1848 ~ Monday   17th The fore part of the day was taken up in business and teach ing and council the spirit of the Lord was with the people Among other subjects President Young spoke upon the subject of danceing and said that danceing was not an ordinance of the gospel or of the House of the Lord. But the organization of man is such that it requires a variety, singing stimulates the whole system and the mental mind to such a degree that they want to dance, this is well enough in its place, every thing that is calcula ted to fill the soul with Joy is ordained of God and is prpoper for the Saints if they acknowledge God in all things and do not sin but dont mingle with the wicked world and sin but serve the Lord with it. And the ownly lawful place to dance is in a tem- ple or a place of endowments, you will never see any music or danceing in Hell neither Joy or gladness will be there but these things will be in Heaven many other interesting rema- rks were made.   The afternoon and evening was spent in music and danceing the old grey headed man, with the young man, maiden and children went forth in the dance together and praised the Lord in the dance and all was peace and harmony   ENDENTRY January 18, 1848 ~ Tuesday   18th The fore part of this day was also spent in teaching and giving council, the Twelve occupied most of the time Two petitions were presented to the meetings for signitures one for a county in the Potawattame tract of land in Iowa and the other for a Post Office and the People were signing them daily Br Henry Miller and others were appointed to go to the Legislature of the State of Iowa to petition for the county and $30 were raised by the people ^to^ bear their expenses many interesting speaches were made by the people   The afternoon and evening of this day was also spent in singing music and danceing, and at the close of the evening this  congregation were dismissed and other branches of the church were to take it tomorrow as all could not get into the House at the same time    ENDENTRY January 19, 1848 ~ Wednesday   19th We had a new and full congregation to day, the fore part of the day was taken up as usual with teaching, instruction and council and the spirit of the Lord was with us. the after noon and evening was as usual spent in singing, music, and dancing, square Merit, the Soux Indian agent, A Major, capt and Lieut. from Fort Carney were present and seemed to be pleased with the appearance of things    ENDENTRY January 20, 1848 ~ Thursday   20th This is the last day of our meeting with the Saints at the Log tabernacle, the congregation was addressed at some length by Br G A. Smith upon a variety of subjects giving advise to the saints not to locate on the river bottom but go to the bluffs and north whare there is a plenty of timber and open farms whare there is plenty of room also advised them to pay their tithing and not admit of making use of ardent spirits, and spoke upon  other subjects and was followed by W. Woodruff who backed up the testimony of Br Smith after which several business matters were taken up.   The afternoon and evening as usual was spent in singing, music, and dancing at the close, President Young addressed the meeting in an interesting manner, and said he wished the Saints to get so quick in their understandings that when they herd his tex that they might know his whole sermon without his preaching it or stoping to explain evry item. And his text was now let  the Saints stop dancing for if you get up parties all over the country here and go to danceing sin and iniquity will grow out  of it but all has been right here thus far I have watched you and all has been in quiete and peacable and good order and the spirit of the Lord has been here. And the President dissmissed the people pronounceing the blessings of God upon the people. I with several other of the brethren spent my time with Br Richards who was vary kind in entertaining the Saints    ENDENTRY January 21, 1848 ~ Friday   21st We all returned home to our dwellings in Winter Quarters it had been exeeding warm and plesant during our whole visit at the Log tabernacle meeting and we found all well on our return home. Br's Nauvoo and returned to Winter Quarters with us and brought some papers giving an account of the wars and distress of nations with famine Pestilence and Judgment   ENDENTRY January 22, 1848 ~ Saturday   22nd I spent the day at home choreing    ENDENTRY January 23, 1848 ~ Sunday   23rd Sunday I preached to the saints in my ward was followed by Brs Pulsipher and Porter and we had a good time and in the eve ning I went to the Council House and met with a large assembly Professor Pratt addressed them quite lengthy upon asstronomy philosophy, and various principles which he had studied much upon and also read a lengthy document which he had written which was highly interesting to us. He advised the seventies to devote all of their leasure moments to reading and study and fulfill the commandments which says we should treasure up wisdom and knowledge by faith and by study out of the best books that we may have a knowledge of things in heaven and on earth of kingdoms and countries things which are at home and abroad, the wars perplexities of nations andc In the lecture given by  Professor Pratt he intirely overthrows many of the systems of modern phylosiphers and asstronomiers and modern reasoning in many respects, to overthrow the gentile Christian Argument, "that God made the Heavens Sun, moon, and stars and the earth and all that in them are out of nothing in six days He said that it was admitted by modern phylosophers that stars had been discoverd through telescopes so remote from the earth that it would take thirty thousand years for the light of it to reach this earth though it should travel at the rate of two hundred thousand  miles per second, so it must have been in exhistance 24000 years before this earth was formed. He overthrows the principle of Immate- riality and clearly shows that God, Angels, spirits, are material as well as men, beasts, vegitables minerals, andc that matter is eternal and infinite without end or bounds and that space is infinite and without bounds or end that matter, the elements, intelligence were not created neither  indeed can be, and were from all eternity and that God formed the Heavens and earth out of unorganized materials or matters which did exhist in some form and were not made out of nothing. In speaking of the spirit of God he remarked to me that the Holy Spirit that was through all things, and round about all things, and that governed and controlled all things are intelligent atoms the same as God is composed of hence it is called the spirit of God, and he had no dobt but that there were some of these atoms combined in all the miner- al, vegitable, and animal Kingdoms and by the aid of those intelligent atoms were enabled to abide the law by which they were governed many other interesting principles were presented by Professor Pratt when he closed I followed him and exhorted the people to listen  to his council and improved their time I also advised the Camp  to hold meetings in each ward on Sunday and prayer meetings at  least one evenings in each week that if they would pray more they would have much less spirit of complaining among them I remarked that the spirit of the Lord and the spirit of the devil would not dwell together but a short time in the same  person or tabernacle but one would govern and the other leave I also warned the people against judging any matter whatever untill they herd both sides of the question for in most all  cases any person would be apt to give a wrong judgment by merely hearing one side of the question. And that the Elders could not be in possession of any to much truth upon any subject whatever in order to magnify there callings among the nations of the earth for if they should be called to stand before Kings Princes, Asstronomiers Phylosophiers and the learned of the earth they would find use for all there knowledge   ENDENTRY January 24, 1848 ~ Monday   24th I met in council withe the Twelve and High Council and herd a charge prefered by the Policee against E. D Wolley for making use of sedicious language against the Authorities of the Church the letter of the accusation was sustained against Br Wolley but it was not supposed by any that the spirit of sedition was in his heart. It proved to be an interesting meeting as much teaching and instruction was drawn out of the Presidency High Council, Twelve andc. Br Wooley in his plea expressed his  feelings that the Hickery Clubs carried by the policee, and the council for Bishops to preside over any parties in the place to keep order, and that the Policee would not suffer a man to let his own cattle get into his own crops to destroy them were oppressive to his feelings. President Young said he wanted to speak upon the  spirit of the thing with Br Wolleys, that the things that oppress Br Wolleys feelings would have no effect upon him if all had been right with him but he had got the spirit of the world and did not feel right. Said that the law was for the unruly and that  it must rest upon good men in order to reach the unruly and transgresser. many gave their opinion upon the subject Br Wooley made his confession that he had spoken in an im- proper manner in a moment of passion he was forgiven by the council and all was settled. W. Woodruff in his remarks said  he would advise evry individual not to make any decision or give any judgment or opinion upon any subject whatever untill they herd both sides of the question, Council was dismissed  and we returned home. Brs Levi Richards and myself visited Br Henman's family to administer to them for the whole family was sick and had been troubled with evil spirits we  prayed with this family and laid hands upon 7 that were sick of the household the spirit of the Lord was with us and we rebuked the sickness and commanded the evil spirits  to depart and they recieved a blessing upon the family. Br's Pratt and Richards returned to my house and spent several  hours in conversing about science, Phylosophy, Astronomy, and a variety of things of interest    ENDENTRY January 25, 1848 ~ Tuesday   25th We met in Council with the Twelve and High Council  John Snider they made a report of  affairs at Young did not wish the temple to be sold and a number of other things were spoken of some little difference of feelings settelled during the evening I attended meeting in our ward    ENDENTRY January 26, 1848 ~ Wednesday   26th I spent the day at home reading, writing, choreings andc I spent the evening at Br Neff.

Mrs Woodruff was quite sick through the night  and kept her bead through the day    ENDENTRY January 31, 1848 ~ Monday   31st The storm abated in the latter part of the night and the  sun arose plesant this morning I spent the day at home    ENDENTRY February 1, 1848 ~ Tuesday   Feb 1st I spent the day at home choreing    ENDENTRY February 2, 1848 ~ Wednesday   2nd I spent the day reading and writing    ENDENTRY February 3, 1848 ~ Thursday   3rd I attended a feast prepared by the defenders of Nauvoo or those  who were in the Battle of Nauvoo most of those who composed  the assembly were individuals who were in that memoriable  action it was ascerted that there was not more than 100 saints  at any one time in the fight while the mob that was fighting  agaist the Saints numbered from 800 to 1000 and their was  but three of the Saints killed and one or two slightly wounded  while there was several waggon loads of the mob killed and many  wounded and the enemy driven from the field, but the Lord  was with the Saints and saved their lives. The Saints wore a  read badge on the left arm to distinguish them from their  enemies in the battle, they wore the same to day at the feast at  the opening of the performences President Kimball deliverd an address upon the subject of the Battle of Nauvoo and was followed by Col Johnson, after which their was feasting singing music and  some dancing. A figure was got up called the Battle of Nauvoo  whiched was danced and the Saints felt to praise the Lord for  their deliverance    ENDENTRY February 4, 1848 ~ Friday   4th I spent the day at home reading the Book of Enoch    ENDENTRY February 5, 1848 ~ Saturday   5th I went into the woods with several of the Brethren and choped  loaded and brought home five loads of wood    ENDENTRY February 6, 1848 ~ Sunday   6th Sunday I preached to a congregation of Saints in Br Phineas  Richards ward and had a good time    ENDENTRY February 7, 1848 ~ Monday   7th I spent most of the day reading I read a pamphlet called  the voice of truth, containing the Prophet Joseph Smith  views of the powers and policy of the government of the United  States, and corressppondence with Gen James Arlington Bennett, appeal to the green mountain Boys, correspondence with, John  C. Calhoon, and Missouri, and an  interesting sermon from President Smith. These letters and  writings are of much interest and show the spirit of the tim- es and the mighty rebuke of wicked men by that great, good,  and wise Prophet Joseph I was much edifyed in reading it  I spent the evening in reading the book of Jasher and was  edifyed with that Br Benbow and myself laid hands upon a  sick youth    ENDENTRY February 8, 1848 ~ Tuesday   8th I spent the day at home during the meeting at our school  house in the evening I gave a synopsis of my meditations  concerning our duties as a people   ENDENTRY February 9, 1848 ~ Wednesday   9th I have been troubled for several days with a head ake  I finished reading the Book of Jasher and found it to be  an interesting work. It speaks of the great victories  the Twelve Patriarchs the sons of Jacob accomplished in  their Battles with their enemies in consequence of their great  faith in God and of Joseph career in Egypt and many other  interesting things    ENDENTRY February 10, 1848 ~ Thursday   10th FIGURE I made President B Young a present of fine  blue broad cloth which I got in England I spent a part  of the day with Br Young I walked with him from the  office to Br Warner Porters whare President Young administered  in the ordances of the house of the Lord. I read several papers from the eastern states which gives an account of the dredful  famine in Ireland more than 130,000 persons have died in the  famine and apparently the destress has but just began, also the  the breaking of the banks and large firms throughout England  which has caused a great panic and much perplexity throughout  those nations the United States are still at war with Texas  and much division in the government concerning the war    ENDENTRY February 11, 1848 ~ Friday to  ENDENTRY February 12, 1848 ~ Saturday   11th and 12th I still suffer with pain in the head I spent these  days at home reading writing and choreing    ENDENTRY February 13, 1848 ~ Sunday   13th Sunday It is the most beautiful and warm weather that  FIGURE I ever saw in the winter time. The Camp of of the  Saints met at the stand for a meeting to day meeting opened  by singing, and prayer by W. Woodruff, the meeting was then addressed by President Kimball then addressed the meeting  and said that he wanted to give an exhertation and a word of  caution and after reproving the saints said many flattered  themselves that they were going to lean upon others to save  them without doing any thing themselves but they will  get disappointed, for to bring up a figure he said you might graft ever so many sproughts into a tree if they did not adhear  to the tree they would remain there dead sticks stick- ing out of the tree they would be dead themselves, not  bring forth fruit, and do the tree no good but ownly scar  it up, and those scars would remain untill the dead sticks  were broakke off and the skcar healed over or other grafts  put in that would bring forth fruit. So it was with all  who leaned upon others to save them and would not  harken to their council and take their advice and no man  can save them if do not save themselves and many  other remarks of Interest he made.   W. W. Phelps then read the V chapter of Math as he  had translated it from the greek   W Woodruff advised the people who were going to  settle on the east side of the river not to settle on the  bank or in the bottoms so that the first flood need  not wash them into the Mo river.   Meeting was dismissed  after which in company with Mrs Woodruff I went to  Br Young and Kimball came  and attended to sealing four couple in matrimony, we had  a feast of spruice beer and cakes on the occasion   ENDENTRY during the evening I attended the meeting of the Seventies  being 3 of their presidents present, Z. Pulsipher  A. P. Rockwood the House was crouded to excess the meeting was opened by singing and prayer. And was then addressed  by A P Rockwood who spoke upon the government of  children that Parents ought to set a good exhample before  their children and not nickname them but call them by  their proper name for the way that Parents set their  children going in life they are apt to go through and if they  start with Jim, Jo, and Pall, they are apt to go through  life so,.   Br Pulsipher followed and made many  interesting remarks. And he was followed by President  Joseph Young who reproved them in the spirit of the Lord  against the spirit of dancing and warned them to forsake all  sin and be faithful in all things He spoke in the spirit and power  of God feeling the responsibility he was under when he closed  his remarks W. Woodruff arose and said that should  I say that I did not desire to address the Seventies I should do  dishonor to my own feelings for I do desire it at this time.  All who know my course when I have been at head quarters with  the Presidency either with Joseph, Brigham, or others of the twelve  know that I have never put myself forward to preach or teach  the people, why hath it been so, because I have had file leaders  between me and God whose business it is to lead teach and instruct  the inhabitants of Zion and I have felt it more my duty to sit  and hear while with them at head quarters than to put myself  forward to teach yet when I have been called upon to speak  I have endeavoured to do the best I could, but when I have  been abroad in the vineyard I have had the spirit of my  mission and been much blessed in bringing souls into the  kingdom of God. And I do feel it a privilege to address  the Seventies at this time, Br Young asked me to speak in  the fore part of the evening but I desired to wait untill the  Presidency of Seventies had address them and I can now see  that it was wisdom for I should not have had the same  matter before me that I now have, I have a number of things  resting upon my mind which I wish to lay before you. Your  President Joseph Young has spoken to you in the spirit and power  of God to night has warned and exhorted you not to defile your Priesthood and calling and not to have your minds all taken  up with fiddleing and dancing. I have taken up more real injoy- ment this evening in hearing the teaching giving by your  Presidency than I would in hearing a million of dollars worth  of fiddle strings worn out, you must not think hard of  Br Joseph Young because he reproves, rebukes, and ehxhorts you  with all long sufferings and doctrin, for their is an almighty  responsibility resting upon his shoulders as the seenier President  of this August body of Sevenenties ordained unto the Apostle- ship and the Lord will hold him responsible for the manner  that he watches over the Seventies and he is stired up from time  to time by the spirit of the God of Israel to reprove you and  the rebukes of a friend are far better than the kisses of an  enemy and you must not think hard of Br Young if he  does reprove you for he does it for your good. It is for better for  you to spend your time getting instruction and council than in  fiddleing and dancing for while the latter is of no profit to you the  former you will need when you are seperated far from your Brethren   ENDENTRY and abroad among the nations of the earth amid the  Judgments of God which are laying waste the people and while  you have to dodge between wind and water to save your head in the midst of persecution after persecution and mobs while  you are offering salvation to the people. I have meditated  much of late concerning the responsibility we are to God under to God inasmuch as we bear the priesthood and are  numbered among the Lords Anointed as Angels are watching us and bearing a report of us daily to God should  the Lord come down to see us to see for himself if the  reports of us was correct, what would the Lord think of  us and how would we like to hear the record read in the morning  of the resurrection containing an account of an assembly  of the Lords Anointed at Winter Quarters, upon whom  all heaven leaned and depended upon in carrying out the  purposes of the Lord in the Lord last dispensation and fulness  of times and fulfilling the expectations of Abraham, Isaac  and Jacob and all the Holy Prophets and Apostles since the world  began in gathering the Jews and rebuilding Jerrusalem gathering  the saints and rebuilding up Zion preparing the way for the  endowment of the ten tribes of Israel in the north country  and the covertion of the Lamanites in the west, and the  warning of all the gentile world that they may be left  without excuse when the Judgments of God cleanse the earth  from sin, wickedness, and pollution, and that our prayers should ascend into the heavens for the Lord to avenge the  Blood of the Prophet Joseph and other saints who have been  martered and slain by gentile mobs in the last days, while  there is so much depending upon us and our prayers should  we be satisfyed with the record of this city of the Saints in the  eternal world kept by the Angels of Heaven If we should  hear read before an assembled world that the inhabitants  of Winter Quarters who were the Lords Anointed during  the winter of 1847 and 8 spent nine days of their time  in fiddleing and dancing whare they did one in prayer and  praise to almighty God, I say would we be satisfyed  with such record? No we would not, then let us turn from  such seenes of folly and spend more time in meetings  for preaching, exhortation, and prayer before the Lord  Br Joseph exhorted the Elders "not to defile their Priesthood."  I will here say If any man wants to feel the pangs of  Hell let him have the Priesthood and let him have immortal glory, eternal life, Thrones power domin- ions, exhaltations with all the blessings of Abraham,  Isaac and Jacob in view, then let him break the  law of God and defile his Priesthood and in a moment  he falls from his high esstate and all of his exhalted  hopes vanish in a moment and when his eyes are open  to see things as they are he sinks in darkness and wo and the vary sight of the blessings which he has lost causes  a hotter Hell through his soul than fire and brimestone  many other remarks were made by the speaker after which  Br England  made some vary appropriate remarks after which the meeting closed   ENDENTRY February 14, 1848 ~ Monday   14th I spent the day at home    ENDENTRY February 15, 1848 ~ Tuesday   15th I spent the day at home but had a good meeting at night    ENDENTRY February 16, 1848 ~ Wednesday   16th I spent this day at home reading    ENDENTRY February 17, 1848 ~ Thursday   17th I carried 9 bushels of wheat and 5 of buckwheat to the water mill I spent the day untill 12 oclok at night with Br Davis grinding in the mill Mrs Woodruff spent the time with Sister Davis and we went home in the night    ENDENTRY February 18, 1848 ~ Friday   18th The soldiers have a meeting to day at the Log tabe- rnacle Br O. Pratt was expected to be  there, O Pratt was there but the others were at Br  Hydes as he had just returned from the east. we also recieved a large mail to day from various parts of the earth several stars from Liverpool showing the rapid progress ot our cause through Scotland and  Wales and of the hard warfare of our worthy friend  Capt Dan Jones it seems as though nearly all Wales was against him yet he is baptizing daily as he is travl- ing through the nation we also got news of the Mexican War, American Congress, the loss of life on the lakes and rivers andc    ENDENTRY February 19, 1848 ~ Saturday   19th I administered to Br Willard Richards early in the morning who has been sick near two months I spent most of the day in reading Br Johnathan containing the life of Gen Z Taylor History of the Mexican War and plates of the several Battles in Mexico andc    ENDENTRY February 20, 1848 ~ Sunday   20th Sunday I preached to the saints in our ward.

Richards and herd two letters read from his Sons in England which were interesting, we then called upon Young came in sat a few moments and I went home with him and spent an hour or two and read some late papers    ENDENTRY February 21, 1848 ~ Monday   21st I spent the day at home    ENDENTRY February 22, 1848 ~ Tuesday   22nd Br city to day the first time he has been here for one year and a half I look him up and brought him home with me he attended meeting with me in the evening and  spent the night with me. He took his cloths which Br Smoot left with us for him    ENDENTRY February 23, 1848 ~ Wednesday   23rd FIGURE I called upon Br Richards in the morning soon Pres- ident Young came in we went into the office and attended  to some Business. Br Brown came in and requested one of us to go and preach the funeral sermon of his daughter who was dead. Presidents Brigham and Joseph Young and myself went to his house, we found not ownly his daughter dead  but a number sick in the house. The meeting opened by singing and prayer by Joseph Young, after which President B. Young arose addressed the meeting and said that he had a few rem- arks to make and desired that he might have the Holy spirit while he spoke. Said it was better to go to the House of mourning than to the House  of feasting for that was the end of the living and would force  upon our minds the truth of the desolution which we must all pass through   ENDENTRY we mourn for the loss of our friends when they die but if they die in the Lord they are better off than the living for they have gained one victory which the living have not they are  beyound the reach of pain, sorrow, wicked men, devils, and devlish spirits which we are not, for we are daily in the midst of all the suffering that mortal man is heir to and  when will this suffering end, when we die and not before, unless we should live untill Satan is bound but all must pass through death. Yet I would be glad to live to assist in binding Satan as to the Saints we are being worn out according to the workd of the Lord we have been driven and persecuted in such a manner that there are but few constit- utions among us except such as are broaken to peaces and ready to fall into the grave and we are burying up the Saints vary fast whareever we go over four hundred are laid  in the grave in this place and many in all places whare we have stoped, but all of this pain, sorrow, death and affliction will work to gether for the good of the Saints for these  things must needs be in order to work out the purposes of the Almighty and give the Saints there exhaltation and Glory in the Eternal World. the sectarian wourld with the knowledge they have would if it was in their power sweep the fall  of man, death, pain, sorrow and afflictions with all their attendant evils into oblivion and caused man to have lived eternally as he was before the fall that he might never  have seen death, but such a course would in the end have been the greatest curse that could have been heaped upon man for by so doing it would entirely have frustrated the design of the Almighty in the Creation of man and blocked up the way for his exhaltation glory and greatness and the Lord understood  the subject so well before either the world or man was formed that a Saviour was provided in the Lamb slain from before the foundation of the world to redeem man from Eternal dead so that by man paying the deabt of the fall by passing through the temporal death, they recieve the power and glory of the resurrection by Jesus Christ which gives them an Immortal body which will recieve a far greater glory and power than the mortal body ever could have obtained unto had it not have been for the fall. And I suppose If I had power IWith the limited Knowledge I have I should sweep from the midst of this people sickness, pain, sorrow, poverty and persecution and mobings I dont suppose I should ever have suffered this people to have been driven at all by a mob but as the Lord knows so much  more than we do He has suffered it so to be and it is for a wise purpose in God, it is for our good and will finally prove for our exhaltation and glory in the eternal world, and gives us experi ence in this life which we otherwise should not have had. "Adam  fell that men might be, men are that they may have Joy, but if they knew no Joy they would have no sorrow, and if they did not know misery they would not know happiness" for man must  experience one in order to comprehend and know the other Jesus had to descend below all things in order to ascend above all things, I am fully convinced that all our sorrows and troubles will work out for us a far more exeeding and eternal wait of glory, hence we ought nought to murmer or complain at our fate. It is true we mourn at the loss of friends but not as those with out hope   ENDENTRY  or blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from hence forth saith the spirit for they rest from their labours (and if their friends are faithful) their works will follow them, but what is the time of our suffering in this life in comparison with Eternity After we have spent millions of ages in Eternity and we look back upon our time here and it will ownly look like the twinkling of an eye in comparison and so it will be in the waiting for the resurrection of our bodies it will be for a moment as it were before we shall stand in our immortal bodies but no person can have power to raise the dead except he holds the Keys of the Resurrection and no man can hold the Keys of the resurrection or be ordained unto that power untill he has died and been raised from the dead himself no more than than a man has power to baptize a man legally and lay hands upon him for the Holy Ghost and ordain him to the office of an Elder who has not been baptized or ordained  himself. Adam) holds the Keys of the resurrection and after a man is raised from the dead has  an immortal body and recieves an ordination to hold the Keys of the resurrection from under the Hands of Michael or those having authority he then has power to raise the dead and not  before. Jesus was the first fruits of the Resurrection "He had power to lay down his life and power to take it again," ##John 10:18## when He  had lain in the grave three days an Angel, some person who  was appointed to this work appeared rolled back the stone and called Jesus forth. We have power here through the Priesthood to lay hands upon the sick and they recover, to cast out devils open the eyes of the blind and unstop the ears of the deef according to the faith of the chil- dren of men. It is just as easy to raise the dead for one who is ordained unto this power as it is for us to administer in the ordinances of the House of the Lord here. Some times we lay hands upon the sick and they are healed instantly other times with all the faith and medicine they are a long time getting well, and others die. The spirit of devils who are deprived of having tabernacles are constantly making war with men who have tabernacles and they strive to take up their abode in the tabernacles of men because they have none of their own, and where they can get a chance they will many of them croud into one man and try to reign there and some times they will kill the body and then  the spirit of the man and devils all have to leave it some times in  sickness and weakness the spirit of deavels get possession of the body whare the spirit of man is pure and overcomes it but the moment the spirit leaves the body it is beyound the power and reach of the devils, some children are killed in this way for the devil is making war with every thing that has a tabernacle esspecially the Saints, and the devil rules a great deal in the hearts of the children of men, and if he cannot go in any other way  he will go into a barrel of whiskey and run down their throats and when the saints get into the valley away from the valley gentiles the deavel will get into the Half mormons Hickery mormons and will plead with them to get into them but when  we consider how little time we have to spend in this life in comparison to Eternity we ought not to consider it a hard matter to be faithful to God and keep his commandments for when we obtain Celestial glory we shall have to exclaim that it is through the grace of God after all, for the glory far exceeds our sufferings  in this life.
