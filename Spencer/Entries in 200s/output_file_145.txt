 Orderville, Kane CountyUtah, Sept 25, 1880.Elder Wilford Woodruff,Dear BrotherSoon after the death of my Brother Joseph W Young the Trustee in Trust of the Church caused to be filed in the Probate Court of Washington County an account against the Estate to the amount of Four Thousand three hundredEighty five dollars and Seventy one cents (4,385.71)The greater part of this amount was for Substance drawn through the St George Tithing Office. There were other claims presented against the Estate to the amount of 18 00 dollars by persons who had been in Joseph W's employment, or who had loaned him small amounts. the Estate has paid 20 cts on the dollar in Stock in the Canaan Co-op Herd to these Parties,and have 8 00 dollars in said Herd that I am ready to pay to the Trustee in Trust if it is desired. But when I remember how dilligently Joseph W. sought to honor his calling, and how much of his life was given in building Zion, I am constrained to ask my Brethren to forgive him this 
 indebtedness, and to cancel the amount on File against him on the Records of the Probate Court.Dear Brother WoodruffWill you please enquire into this matter.I have written several times to Prest E Snow and once to Elder L. J. Nuttall, but duties of a more pressing nature seem to claim their time. I am anxious to have the affairs of the Estate settled & hope to hear from you.Praying my Heavenly Father to Bless You with life and victory over Your Enemies, I remainRespectfully Your BrotherJohn R Young[sideways text]John R.

Your kindness to me while with you I can never forget. I was happy and contented in your home. Since I have been in the North I have had the privilege of administering to my wife Phebe and Blessing her before her deathand Anointing her for her burial, which was a great satisfaction to me. I have also had the privilege of meeting with most of my family and spending considerable time with quite a Number of my Children and many others my Daughter from Iowga whom I did not look for. I have had much satisfaction in my visit with my family which was an unlooked for privilege so soon when at yourHome. I feel to send my Love & blessings to you & all your family. I wish to be rem-embered to them, & John Squire (Concerningthat grave you speak of anything Needed to be done so as not to Loose its Identity would be thankfully Received.

June 8, 1888Dear Brother & Sister CottamI received Brother Cottams Letter of May 3, & read it with much interest I am very glad if my Photograph is of any Satisfaction to Any body at Least my friends My health is about as usual I have gone cold in my head which affects my Hearing some you see we have had to bury Brother Snowwe done all we could to save him but He had to go, when I see so many going I feel as though my turn cannot be a great way off but I hop to be prepared I am still overwhelmed in business, my family are as well as usual Emma wishes to be remembered to you & all the families 
 I will say to Father & Mother Cottam should providence call me again to St George I certainly should be happy to accept of your kind offer In calling upon you for I never felt more at home or happier than while thare. And I very Highly Appreciate such Kindness and more Esspecially while in Exile. Yes Brother Cottam I have had many a happy Meal at Mother Cottams Table and spent many a happy hour in her Chamber which my record will show often my spirit  mingles with friends in the spirit world It may be thought strange for me to remarkthat it was a great relief to my spirit when my wife Phebe went to rest, she had become so feeble and worried so much about me, and the times, that she could no longer enjoyLife and almost the last word she spoke when dying she enquired if I was safe, her whole trouble seemed to be about me, and what-ever troubles I may be called to pass through I would rather pass through them alone than for Her to any Longer share them with me. I thank the Lord she is safe through her pilgrimage and rejoicing with her Children, parents & friends in the spirit world and she will ownly have time to visit awhile with them before I shall Join her. I pray the Lord to Bless you with health, Strength and peace that you may Live as long as you desire Life Your Brother in the Gospel L Allen 
 We had a good time in the dedication of the Temple I dedicated it first but did not stay to the public Dedication but the Saints had a glorious time and many manifestations of the power of God I expect Brother McAllister will be with you again soon. I have now in the Historian Office a Jerman Jewish Rabbi who has Lately joined the Church translatingthe Book of Mormon into the Jewish Language and when it is translated He wants to go on a Mission to the Jews and preach the Book of Mormon & the Gospel to the House of Judah He is deeply engaged in the work Dyer the Receiver is still hunting for Church property. He wants all the Church has ever owned since 1862 He says the Earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof and He is the receiver But I dont think He will take much of [it] with him down to the pit. God Bless you is the prayer of yer Brother Lewis Allen

 The following Remarks were made byWilford Woodruff:I feel to endorse the remarks and counsel given by Pres. Young, and the brethren, on this occasion. I do not believe that it is designed by our Father in Heaven thatany thing that has been given or organised for the buil-ding up of this Church, is ever to decrease, but to increase.While Pres Young was speaking of the little time we have to spend here, and of the great purposes of God to be accomplished, the thought struck me,how few there are, upon the face of the ^whole^ earth that have this work to do. When we compare the Saints of God with the world; our numbers are very few.  Out of twelve hundred millions of people who live upon the face of the earth we have perhaps, a hundred thousand of this people to-day, perhaps a few more taking women and children. A great work in this last dispensation 
 rests upon these few men and women, for the littl time we have to spend.A Female Relief Society was organised in the days of Joseph Smith for a purpose. I believe the Lord had a motive in view in inspiring Pres. Young to organise these Societies; they should increase. The Sisters have a great deal to do in this kingdom; and a great many things that are committed to their charge will prove a blessing to them, and to the community, and to the kingdom, ofwhen properly carried out.Pres. Young has referred to the subject of our fash-ions. I consider that the fashions of this people rest with the Sisters; especially with those that belong to the Relief Societies.  This counsel given to us concerning our lives and our acts is for our good and we should carry it out. There is allways something for the sisters to do. There is scarcely a month that passes but what something arises where a united effort of the sisters is good for the building up of the Kingdom.There is something coming now. You have the priviledge of uniting with the brethren in building the Temple of the Lord. You can help in this; and you have manifested in the past, by your works, that you can do something. There is a great deal to do. We want to build a Temple in Salt Lake City; and this is a work that the Lord requires at our hands; and the sisters can assist in this, as in all other works in the Kingdom of God.I never expect to see the time while I live in the flesh   there will no time   but what this kingdom will increase, and arise. God has decreed it: And no matter what position we are in persecution, in drivings, and with the wrath and indignation of the world upon us   it has increased and it will do so 
 When I look through this Territory, it does appear to me that the gentiles themselves cannot come here and look upon this Territory and people, without feeling that God is here, whether they acknowledge it or not. There is something besides the ingenuity of man; and I believe the Testimony of the Elders, the Spirit of God, bears record to our enemies, while here, of this work, that God is with it. This testimony come with it, more or less, wherever the Elders goIt is true the world reject it; and hence the Lord takes His Spirit from them; but the Lord does bear record by the Holy Ghost to them of this work. The building up of his Kingdom has to be accomplished. Zion has to prosper and be built up, and become a strong nation; and there will be no end to it until Christ comes.I feel to bless the sisters, as a Society, in this place. They have done well here; and their labors are worthy and the blessings of God will rest upon them. We have to be united together in the erection of this Church and the kingdom. We have the whole earth against us, and if the Lord has any friends on earth, they are here in the vallies of these mountains.I feel that we shall be protected in our homes and our rights, if we will do the will of God, no matter what that will may be. This people have never had the protection as a church, from the time of the translation of the Book of Mormon to the present day, as they have had since the Lord revealed and published the Patriarchol Order of MarriageThe Lord says you shall obey this. The world says you shall not do it. But in carrying it have we not been blest. We have had more protection since we have been in the valleys of the Mountains than before; and I feel that the Lord will protect us in doing right 
 and keeping his commandments. Woe be to that man or family or people that fight against Zion. Every weapon shall be broken that is raised against Zion. The Lord has sustained us over and over again against the opposition of forty million of people. He is laboring by faith. He has preserved us to the present time. Now this should be an evidence to us and to the world that the Lord has a hand in this work; and that He will protect this peopleLet us unite ourselves together, and the blessings of the Lord will be over us. We have been a little slow, perhaps, in carrying out the counsel to further the home products. I do not think that we, as a people, shall be any too soon independent of the products of babylon.  May God bless us, and may we receive these counsels, and carry them out in our lives. Amen

And I fear to take them in-to the cold climate of ^Pocatello^ Idaho, that it would go hard with them. I have no means at 
 home that I can draw from, I can putin my time to good advantage in themission till the middle of March.Besides needing cloths I need money to payfreight on house hold goods, for unless weShip what we have here have Sister Daltonwill not have anything at all for her usewhen she gets home for everything ^she has^ inthe furniture line is here.The larges bill I owe is due on the 19th inst. And if it is paid: on or beforethat date it will be $44. 76/100 but if it runs overthat date it will be $51. 95/100 this being thediscount I will get if paid when due, $7. 19/100With kind regards to all and hopingto hear from you be return mailI am Your BrotherJ.

 131 1/2 Gough StreetSan Francisco Jan 2d 1894Prest. Wilford Woodruff & Counselors,Dear Brethren:  I enclose Financiel & Statistical reports for the year ending December 31st 1893.Dr J. P. P. Van Den Bergh, told me a little over a year ago that we could have a room to holdmeetings in rent free,  January 8th 1893 we held our first meeting in his house, and continued to hold them every sunday as well as week nights till December 17 1893.Last Spring we were in ^living^ Sacramento. I had to move from there,  I had no money to pay rent, so I ask the Dr if he would allow meus to live inthe rooms we held meeting in here in S.F. rent free, he said yes, and he put somefurniture into the rooms. (We had no furniture)On the 7th of last April I brought my wife down from Sacramento, and lived there ^in the Drs house^ tillthe 20th last month.  On the 4th of last month the Dr gave me notice to leave, I ask him his reasons, he said that he had nothing at allagainst me, nor my wife, nor children, but he did not want the meetings there any longer,farther than this he did not wish to say any thing only he wished to withdraw from the 
 Branch, and he wanted to have his wifes name withdrawn also.  He gave us two weeks to movein.  We have rented a house, at the above address wWe have rented a nice hall at # 927 Mission StreetWe are much better situated than we were be-fore, but we have rent to pay, and all our people are poor  we have about twenty active membersincluding children and of these some are sisters ^some^ widows, some with sick husbands, and some with their husbands out of the Church ^& are very much opposed to us^ and some of ^the^ brethren are out of work. So it will be hard work to keep up the rent ^ourselves^. Can you allow & send us $20 per month, to pay rent with? Untill we are able to take care of ourselves, which will be when our brethren obtain employ-ment.  The Saints do all the can for the support of the mission, but now we have an extra ex-pence on us, and before we had rent to pay we had all we could do to live and unless we can get a little, to help us with the rent I fear we will not be able to pay it and live.Kind regards to all, Your brother J. L. DaltonI understand an allowance has been made to cover the above named rent.J. F. S.[sideways text]J. S. DaltonJany 2 [18]94 [end of sideways text] 
 131 1/2 Gough StreetSan Francisco Jan 23 1894Prests Woodruff and Counselors,Dear Brethren: Yours of the 15threleasing me is to hand.  I cannot say that I feel thankful for it, forthe reason that I have labored undervery adverse circumstances, and it doesnot look like I have done anything.I am just begining to see a little ofthe result of my labors, and to leave itjust now it looks like I have not accomplished any thing, I would havemuch prefered to have remained here an other year, But I have made ita rule of my life to do, in the church-as I have been told, so I bow in sub-jection to what you say but not witha thankfull heart, but with many regrets. I will abide your council anddo as you have said.With kind regards to all,your brotherJ.L. Dalton.It is not usual that an elder receives his release to come home with unthankfulness, I think it is an indication that his release is timely.J.F.S

The large picture of the Salt Lake Temple, framed, but glass cracked across the middle, is a sermon in itself, and would do a great deal of good in the San Francisco Mee-tinghouse. Could it be left here? Tracts and Deseret News sent here for distribution, will be left with the San Francisco Branch, thus re-ducing considerable weight in our freight, and doing good here. The record of daily visitors at our Exhibit will be submitted to you on my return. It contains names of people from every clime upon the earth almost, and of some eminent men and women, all of whom have received my testimony in some shape or another, and the most of them have been presented with tracts. I take the liberty of suggesting, that a copy of "Analysis of the Book of Mormon" should be given with aevery copy of the Book of Mormon to be sold, and also the "Story of the Book of Mormon"urgently be recommended to the purchaser.I have found here these two ^to be^ great auxiliaries to my testimonies concerning the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. Among the tracts placed at the disposal at this Fair; I have found, "The Modern Prophet" and "The Plan of Salvation"to be the most available.

San Francisco, July 27, 1894.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Having been set apart for my mission to California,at the Historian's Office, Friday, January 20th, last, I started, accompanied by my daughter Ottilie, for my destination,Monday, January 23, and arrived at San Francisco, Wed-nesday, January 25. Elders John L. Dalton and Ezekiel L. Blod-gett recived me us at the landing with whom I shortly after proceeded to the Midwinter Fair Grounds to present my letter of introduction to Mr. Badlam, Secretary of the MidExecutive Committee. It gives me much pleasure to report to you the uniform kindness with which Mr. Badlam has trea-ted me in consequence of which all preliminary arrange-ments for our educational exhibit were greatly facilita-ted.The Exhibit.A place ^space, 15 x 17 ft^ on the North Gallery of the Liberal Art Buil-ding, had been assigned us, by th and we proceeded at once to dedicate that place in a quiet and undemon-strative manner. One of the bretheren of the San Fran-cisco Branch was engaged to put up the fixings undercontract, and in a few days we were ready to

REYNOLDS, SECRETARTY.The California Mission has at present beside my-self, Bros. Williams, Keller, and Blodgett, as Missio-naries, of whom the latter two ought to be releasedto return home. These bretheren, although faith-ful man, are, it seems to me, entirely nonsuitedfor this peculiar field of labor. There is a spiritof selfsufficiency prevailing among the people ofCalifornia, and San Franciscan in particular, thatcauses people to look with supercilious contemptupon any man attempting to teach or preach thatdoes not come up to their standard of intelligence.A man, laboring here as Missionary, needs muchwisdom and some experience, or else, he is simpl-ly "walked over". Bro. Williams would do as avaluable assistant to a President of the Missionthat would be able to carry on a vigorous cor-respondence with scattered members throughoutCalifornia, engage the attention of men of edu-cation and refinement, and exercise a kind ofmagnetic influence upon the public meetingsof the Saints. If this Mission shall ever be strongand extensive, great care will have to be 
 commence our labors in representing to the people the spirit and status of the Education among theLatterday Saints in Utah. To this end the leading institutions of our Church School Organisation had been communicated with and promisesfor cooperation had been obtained from the Brigham Young Academy, at Provo, and fromthe Latterday Saint College, at Salt Lake.  Dr. James E. Talmage also contributed from his own private collection rare specimens of microscopic views.All of these were to be augmented by a large con-signment of the principal publications of our Church by Geo. Q. Cannon & Sons.For some unexplained reason much delay wasexperienced in obtaining our boxes from the East and our exhibit remained empty until Saturday, Febr. 24, when a portion of them were received, put up, and made ready for opening the exhibit on Monday, Febr. 26. It was a very in com-plete exhibit, as far as the educational part was concerned, for none of the things from the Brigham Young Academy had arrived yet.   But the specimens in Drawing and Penman-ship from the Latterday Saint College; and Bro. Talmage's photographic views, with the Sunday School Charts helped me out considerably in that line, although compared with the other educa-tional exhibits of Santa Cruz County, St. Mary's College,Mills College, Deaf and Dumb Institute, and the 
 taken in the selection of the suitable men forthis somewhat peculiar field of labor.The Local Priesthood with Bro. Mortensen,as Branch President, at their head, are beginningto be aline to their duties, in which Bro. Mar-tensen is leading out most energetically. The largemajority of the Saints, 43 registered, are peoplethat have drifted away from Zion for somereason or another, and are being labored withaccording to circumstances, to bring them to arealisation of the requirements of the Gospel. The"Josephites" have been exercising a most per-nicious influence among them formerly.There are several people investigating the principles of Mormonism, and the attendancesof strangers at our meetings is gradually increasing. It will be a hard pull, financially,for this Branch to raise their monthly rentafter the Midwinter Fair is over, as the con-tributions from visiting Saints from Utahand Sister Caine's Tithing will then cease, allof which have been the main source of incomethus far. I am now anxiously awaiting your instructions in regard to what is to be doneafter July 4th with this Mission.With kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser

REYNOLDS, SECRETARY.189University of California, all adjoining ours on the same gallery, we stood as yet a poor show. The church-works made a fine display though, and were assisted in that by the grand picture of the First Presidency, the large picture of the Temple, representations in frame of the Latterday Saint College; the Utah Sugar Works, and a large album with the portraits of our Leaders.All these furnished me abundant material for ex-planations and testimony. Notwithstanding theas yet incomplete representation of ours education-al status, visitors commenced to increase daily innumbers and began to manifest greater interesteither pro or con as time went on. After severalweeks of vexatious delay the contributions from theBrigham Young Academy finally arrived and lif-ted us at once upon an equal footing, educationallyspeaking, with the other exhibits on the gallery.Foremost among the B. Y. A. specimens more the twolarge cases of Carving Work, of the "Pocket Knife Class"as Professor Townshend, who has charge of that de-partment there, calls it. There was nothing like it inthe Midwinter Fair, as claiming to have been done 
 by beginners in that line of work, and the comments on it were frequent and in high terms. Specimens of Normal ^and^ physical diagrams,penmanship, and drawings made up the balance.Our exhibit being thus complete, as short time of notice, limited preparations and circumstan-ces could possibly make it, a large sign in front of our booth with the legend "LatterdaySaints' Educational Exhibit", gave notice to all visitors who we were. A book of visitors was opened, into which many, about 1200, have inscribed their names. There are names from Japan, Australia, India, Palestine, Egypt, Italy, Greece, Turkey, France, Germany, Scandinavia, England, the United States, and Sandwich Islands, names of many creeds, and of all classes of society in it. With very few exceptions, each one of them has heard my testimony, and a great many more, that did not write their names. Our exhibit was opened daily at 9 AMand closed at 5 P. M. as all other educational exhibits did. We did not open on Sundays, as I had been instructed to do, as Bro. Cummings, who should alternate with me Sundays, was called home, and I had noone else competent to be trusted with that work and my labors seemed to be indispensable at our Sunday meetings and Sunday school.

REYNOLDS, SECRETARY.189The fair closed officially on July 4th at midnight. Asall educational exhibits commenced packing up the day following and nothing but confusion and noise, dust, and turmoil was going on on the gallery, I was obliged to follow suit and closed up also. With the assistance of Bros. Blodgett and Williams, our two missionaries here, Bro. Mortensen who had put up our fixings, packed up the boxes and I had themconveyed to the Territorial Exhibit in charge of Sister Caine at the Mecashine Hall, from where they will go to Utah with the rest.The Mission.Soon after my arrival at San Francisco I found that the California Mission was in an unsatisfactory con-dition which had just a few days before culmina-ted in the disgraceful episode of Greenwell's convic-tion for defrauding his employers. He was the Presi-dent of the Branch and Bro. Dalton mhad manifes-ted such lively interest in Greenwell that he laid himself open to suspicion among the Saints.  The papers were full with articles against this "Mormon scandal", and the Josephites, who thus far had 
 the upperhand here, made the most of it. Our meeting place, 927 Mission Str, was in an undigni- fied locality, with crowds of loafing and smok-ing Socialists holding their meeting on the ground-floor at the same time, and crowding at the entrance, thus forcing ladies wanting to come to our meetings, to push their way through the best they could. The Saints were discouraged through having to carry ^in part^ athe family of the President, for which the small bBranch was not prepared.  To the credit of Bro. Dalton it must be stated,however, that he has labored hard and unceasing-ly to work up this mission. His misfortune was that he had a family on his hands, where he should have been free from such anxieties, and that he had called for more missionaries than there was work for them, and finally that neither he nor his missionaries, with the exception of Bro. Cummings and to some extent, Bro. Williams, were exactly the kind of men needed in this peculiar field of labor. Of great assistance to us were our visitors to the Midwinter Fair from Zion who rendered us financial help by their liberal contributions. But above all the visitsof Apostles Thatcher, Young, Smith and Lyman, and of Elders ^Goddard^ Reynolds and Roberts have been of greatbenefit to us. 
 Office of theGeneral Board of EducationOF THEChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.WILFORD WOODRUFF, PRESIDENT KARL G. MAESER, D. L. D., GEN. SUPERINTENDENT,GEO. REYNOLDS, SECRETARY.189Our Sundayschool has been reorganised and brought into greater conformity with the  pl instructions given by the S. S. Union Board and General Super-intendency. My efforts in organizing a Relief Society here, have thus far not been successful, but we are conducting now a testimonymeeting every Thursday evening, which is also attended by strangers.The removal of our meetings to our new quatrters to the "California Mission Chapel" 29 Eleventh Str, has been a great step in advance, and our mee-tings are well attended now by strangers, and in-quiring friends. A Choir has been organised, antaught, and conducted until last week by my daughter Ot-tilie. Since her return home, I have had to take charge of it myself the best way I could in singing and playing the organ, being assisted in this work by Bro. Hyde, of Ogden, who is attending here the Medical College. As the rent for this little chapel is $3000 permonth, and nearly $500 more for the rent of the organ,gas, and water, but Bro. Mortensen is paying $1000out of it for rent of the basementrooms, there are still $2500, to be raised monthly. $1500 have 
 been subscribed for thus far as monthly con-tributions by members of this Branch, one half of whom are women, either widows or married to outsiders. This will be a serious question to be solved, as thus far the assistance rendered ^us^ somaterially rendered us by visitors to the Mid-winter Fair and $900 Tithing monthly fromSister Caine, will cease. As there are severalparties investigating the Gospel and some areready for baptism, some hope is entertainedthat are increase of contributions can belooked for at an early day. The work has nowbegun, and many that have drifted intothe Josephite Church are beginning to reflectand discover that they are on the wrong sideof the fence. Much now depends how this awa-kening is kept up, and that the Lord by HisHoly Spirit may bless and assist the labors ofHis servants in this Mission in the future to thesalvation of many souls, is the prayer ofYour brother in the Gospel,Karl G.

S.After the departure of Bro. Cummings for home, the Branchat Sacramento was left in charge of Bro. Keller whose personalacquaintance I made several weeks later. Bro. Keller beingentirely inexperienced in writing, it was with much difficul-ty that I could gather some information about the conditionof the Saints there the more so as it was impossible for meunder the circumstances to pay them a visit. It appears,however, that the little life existing in that Branch wentgradually down as soon Bro. Cummings had left, andBro. Keller was utterly discouraged, hence my request forhis release. Two efficient elders may be able under divineguidance to revive the work.Bros. Williams and Maycock, laboring in San Bernar-dino and vicinity, reported to me regularly their labors.From their letters it became apparent however, that theJosephites were having things their own way in SouthernCalifornia, and that these young missionaries weresimply walked over. This opinion was shared by EldersLyman and Roberts during their visits in SanBernardino, Las Angeles, and San Diego. Both youngbretheren, therefore, by your instruction, were transferred 
 to San Francisco, and Bro. Maycock shortly after releasedto return home, where he suddenly died of heart disease.Bro. Williams is now laboring with me here, and is provinghimself a faithful man, engaging the confidence andrespect of the Saints. His strength shows itself chieflyin his visits among the Saints, as he is not a fluentspeaker in public. Bro. Blodgett has gone home withhis honorable release, where his presence is urgentlyneeded.By the kindness of Apostle Brigham Young I havebeen regularly supplied of late with the Daily DeseretNews; while Apostle Lund has sent me regularly theMillennial Star; all of which has been of muchcomfort and assistance to me, and has beengratefully appreciated.Bro. Jas. H. Crockwell, the photographer, now here onbusiness, has kindly taken photographic views ofour Educational Exhibit at the Fair, and of theCalifornia Mission Chapel, the negatives for whichare now in the hands of Bro. Savage for reproduc-tion.As the San Francisco newspapers charge invariablyfor a short church notice 60 cents, we had soon togive up advertising in that way, the more so as wedid not notice any particular attention being paidby the public to that mode of advertisement. We havenow cards printed for distribution with the aArticlesof Faith on one side and a polite invitation withplace and times of meetings on the other.Karl G. Maeser.[sideways text] K. G.

We arivd in Commerce on the 18th and called upon Brothe Joseph Smith & his family. I allso say may other old friends who had been driven from place to place yet they felt well, & were not Discouraged but felt to trust in God. The Saints felt Determined to ^try to^ buildup a City where ever they went. Commerce was beautifulfor situation yet there was but two or three buildings in the town. After spending a short time visiting oldacquaintances I crossed the Missippi River in a ferry boat and landed in Montrose Iowa. this was the first time I Ever was in the Territory Montrose was built for a garrison in 1834 by the United States Army It containd about 12 bloks of building making about 75 rooms in all. After spendingthe night in Docter Gallands office, I moved my family and effects into a Room on the west side of the public squa[r]e. this room I occupied untill I started uponmy mission for England and my family occuped it after my Departure

 On the 22nd day of July 1839, Joseph the prophet having beensick for several days, & his home & Door yard containg many of the sick saints who had Been driven from Missouri. Joseph arose from his bed with the power of God Resting upon him And He took the sick by the hand & in a loud voicecommanded them in the Name of Jesus Christ to arise & be made whole & he healed all that were in his house & around about He then took some of the Twelve with him & walked up the River bankabout a mile & healing all that were sick as he went along & they were may among the Number was Elder Sherwood who lay at the point of Death. He crossed the River to Montrose went into the Home where BrighamYoung lay sick & healed him, who walked out of the Home & followed him. The prophet came to where I was standing & told me to follow him I did so we then went into the Home of Elijah Fordham who was at the point of Death, his friends had looked for him to breath his Last for several hours. He had lost his speech & nearly his breath. we walkedinto the Room Brother The prophet Joseph took brotherFordham by the Hand & looking the dying man in the Eyes for several moments. He them said Brother Fordham,in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I comndyou to arise & be made whole. The voice of the prophet was like the voice of God it seemed as though the whole Home shook from its very foundation And the man leaped from his bed & was made whole instaneously He kicked his pettiees off from his feet, dressed himself Eat a Roll of bread & milk & followed us out of the House & went into the House of Bates Nobles who was also very sick the prophet Healed him & we knelt down & pryd & gve thanks to God. The wicked became alarmed at the seeingthe power of God and followed to see what the End wouldbe After the propht Had healed, all the sick saints in Montrose He with several of the Twelve & S. Rigdon went 
 to the ferry to Return to Nauvoo. A Gentile came to him & asked him if He would not go out into the country some two miles & heal a pair of Twinn chldren about 3 months old both of which were vary sick. He said I cannot go but I will send a man, who will do just as well. He Turned The prophet Turned to me & said you go with this man & teach him & his Houshold the princplesof faith in Christ then lay your hands upon the Chldren & heal them in the name of the Lord At the same time handing me a silk Bandanna red Hankerchief & said wipe their faces with that Handkerchief & they shall get well ^and as long as you will keepthis Handkerchief it shall ever remain as a league between you & me^ then the prophet returnedhome & I went & done as I was Comma[nded] & the children were healed. The deeds of this day showed me more of the power of God in healing of the sick than I ever before saw in the Church & kingdom of God in any dayof my life.

 London Oct 18, 1840, Sunday G. A. Smith & myself met at Father Cornors & held three meetings though the day and Eveningwe red in the book of Mormon, broke bread to the Saints. I felt the Spirit of God bore testimony to me that there would be a great work in LondonWe retired to rest in good season. I felt well in my mind and slept untill about 12 oclok at night I awoke and meditated upon the things of God untillabout 3 oclok in the morning and while forming a Determina-tion to warn the Inhabitants of London, & overcome the powers of darkness which were besetting us day by day and trying to overcome us. As I was forming this determination in my own mind A personage appearedunto me which I considered was the prince of Darknssdarkness or the Devil. he made war with me and attemptdto take my life He laid hold of me like a strong armed man. I felt like the wait of a heavy man lying upon my body and he caught me by the thoat with a strong grip and choaked me nearly to death I struggled with him as one man would struggledwith another I felt as though this destroyer would ovecomme & that I must die as I saw no way that I couldEscape his grasp, at that instant the thought came to me why do you not pray, & call upon the Lord for help. I them asked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ to deliver me from the powers of the Devil & preseve my lifeinstantly three personages came through the door drapd in white with considerable light surrounding them they came up to the bed side where I was lying in the graspof the Enemy & they laid their hands upon my head & inthe twinkling of an Eye I was liberated & the spirit of God vibrated my whole body from the crown of my head to the soulsof my feet and I was instantly covered all over in a light state of perspiration water stood upon ^me^ in drops As soon as I could speak I spoke to GBroth G A Smith & I foud that he had been Laboring under the same 
 difficulty the same power of the Destroyer had been seeking his Life as well as my own, and he was delivered in the same way. The three personages that appeared unto me one was a tall man I shoude think over six feet the other middle one was anothe man was medium size & the 3rd was a short man they wee all dressed alike Neither of them spoke a word to my hearing but as soon as they laid hands upon my head & I was delivered they disappeared. I felt thankful to God for the presirvation of my life. (Brother Tullage Record this in one of the Blank pages & Refer to the page)Oct 7th 1840. In company with the Twelve and manyother Saints I attended a Discussion in the Evening held at the Carpenters Hall, Garrett Road, Manchester.  One MrBarrett had tried hard for a length of time to getsome of the Twelve to hold a discussion with him. th[r]ough his continued teazing president Brigham Young told himthe Twelve would not stoop to discuss any subject with him but if he must discuss the subject of MormonsmHe would appont some bo[d]y to meet him as Mr Barry would not take no for an answer Brothe Alfred Cordenwas apponted to meet him Brother Cordon as it were was a Beardless boy yet he had been ordand an Elder & possessed much of the Spirit of the Lord And they met for this purpos at Early candle light. The Stand was occupied on one side by many Methodist priest, & on the othe side by the Twelve Apostles & Elders. The Home was lightby 3 chandeliers with 12 lights in each lighted with gass there was some 1500 people present. Mr Barrett pledged him-self to prove the Book of Mormon Fals & water Baptism ^not^ Essential to Salvation while Brother Cordon pleged himself to prove the Book of Mormon true & waterBaptisms essential to Salvation. As Mr Barrytt arose & declgaired to the Assembly that He would prove the Book of Mormon Fals & watter baptism not essential to Salvation 4 ^glass^ chimney in each of the chanderliers burnt

 Autobiography of Wilford WoodruffThe remaining months of the year 1841 was spent by the Twelve, after their return from their successful mission in Gto Great Britain, in settling their families in Nauvoo and taking charge of the affairs of the affairs Church.

Of all men, the life-workand enterprise of the class who establishcommerce, build railroads, develop thenative mineral resources of the country,and construct the financial power of theState, must per force tend to the publicprosperity as well as conserving and pre-serving society.

The Churchowes to her apostles of commerce and fin-ance more than many would like to con-fess; and yet in this point of their extra-ordinary service to the Church is at oncethe significance and potency of "Zion'sCo-operative Mercantile Institution."This will be strikingly illustrated in thecircumstantial history of "Z.

Let us look atthe other side now, and ask somethingof what the merchants have done for thecommunity, and what "this people"have made out of the merchants? Andthis line of review of our commercialhistory is very necessary to be under-stood, insomuch as it will be suggestiveof what the community already owe tothe existence  of "Z. C. M. I." And,furthermore, the remarkably successfulexample of that unique Institution dur-ing the last twelve years, under theunited incorporation of these apostlestemporal with the apostles spiritual, willforeshadow the vast results which thecommunity will derive in the future inthe growth and augmentation of the pow-er and resources of said Institution.A cursory view has been given of the destitute condition of the Mormon peo-ple during the first period of the settle-ment of these Valleys. As late as 1856,there was famine in Utah, and thecommunity was barely preserved by theleaders wisely rationing the whole anddividing among the people their ownsubstance. But it was neither the econ-omy and wisdom of the leaders, nor theplentiful harvests that followed, that re-deemed Utah from the depths of herpoverty, and the anomalous isolation ofa people reared in lands of civilizationand plenty. She was redeemed from hersocial destitution by a train of Providen-tial circumstances on the one hand, andthe extraordinary activities of her mer-chants on the other. As we have seen,the Providence came in a United StatesArmy; the temporary existence of CampFloyd; the departure of the troops,leaving their substance to the community;the needs of the Overland Mail line; theconstruction of the telegraph lines; andthen again the arrival of another U. S.army under Colonel Connor, and the es-tablishment of Camp Douglas with sev-eral thousand soldiers to disburse theirmoney in Salt Lake City after their paydays, besides the constant supplies whichthe camp needed from our country, andoften labor from our citizens. It was then, under these changes and propi-tious circumstances, that our Utah mer-

 TULLIDGE'SQUARTERLY MAGAZINE.No. III. APRIL, 1881. Vol. I.UTAH'S COMMERCE AND CO-OPERATION.CHAPTER I.THE INITIAL VIEW OF OUR COMMERCE.THE history of Utah commerce isvery unique. In some respects,there is not a State or Territory inAmerica whose commercial history willcompare with that of our Territory. Itscharacter has been as peculiar as its com-monwealth, and that has given to it atyping quite uncommon in its genius;yet the typing in accord with the co-op-erative policies which the age has de-vised in solving the problem betweencapital and labor. There is also muchstirring romance in its history. Itsstory and incidents are almost as roman-tic as the commerce of Arabia whosemammoth caravans, in their journeysacross the deserts, have given subject andnarrative to the most gorgeous romancesin the whole range of literature. Thejourneys of the trains of these merchantsof the West over the Rocky Mountainsand the vast arid plains between SaltLake City and the Eastern States, andtheir arduous task and adventurous ex-periences will fitly compare with the his-tory of the merchants of the East in old-en times when civilization herself wasfostered by commerce; and, moreover,in the early days of Utah, it took asmuch commercial courage, perseveranceand ability to establish the commerce ofthis Territory as it did that of any na-tion known in history. On the veryface of the record, we may discern thatthe men who did this work were no or-dinary men. They were capable of mak-ing their mark in any land; and if Utah,in the early days, afforded them great op-portunities, it was their boundless ener-gies and commercial ambitions that firstcreated those opportunities and made apeople comparatively affluent who hadbeen buried in isolation and in thedepths of poverty. Thus considered,the biographies of our commercial menhave a peculiar charm of interest whichgives a dignity to the personal record oftheir lives far above that of the ordinaryhistory of self-made men and successfulfinanciers. Indeed, the history of ourcommercial men is substantially the his-tory of Utah commerce.But the initial exposition of Utah com-merce is undoubtedly that derived from her peculiar commonwealth, and the ex-traordinary history of the Mormon peo-ple who settled these valleys; and thiswill lead us directly through variousphases of development to the commercialculmination to be illustrated in "Zion'sCo-operative Mercantile Institution."To type our commercial history for thepopular understanding, it may be de-scribed as Israelitish; and so its char-acteristic inscription of "Holiness to the Lord" is neither fanciful nor presumptu-ous, but fundamental and typical. Itmay be confessed that the inscription hasbeen often burlesqued by the "Gentile;"but the sociologist would quickly read init a volume concerning the genius andcommonwealth of a people expressed ina gigantic commercial institution which,in its vast activities, influence and specialmethods, may become famous as thegreatest marvel in the history of moderncommerce.And, just in this initial view, we mustkeep in sight the men who founded theInstitution and especially those who arethe proper representatives of the com-merce of the Mormon people. It wouldbe a very false-sighted view to consider"Z. C. M. I." as a colossal commer-cial monument of the Church apart fromthose commercial founders. That insti-tution, in fine, is the organic embodi-ment of the life-activities of such men asWilliam Jennings, William H. Hooper, Horace S. Eldredge, Hyrum B. Clawson,William C. Staines, Godbe and Mitchell 
 Pres. Woodruff then addressed the con-gregation; commenced by saying good morning,God bless you all. Some sixty years ago I firstheard the sound of the gospel of the son of God.I invited the Elders home with me to spend the night.I read the Book of Mormon most of the night, andin the morning went to a stream of water and wasbaptized: had been taught under Presbyterianministers all through childhood, but hungered for the gospel of Christ and His apostles; andwould have walked hundreds of miles to beholdan Apostle. Contrasted his visit through the stateof Illinois during the past summer, with the dri-vings and persecutions of the saints in the year 1834.Exhorted the sisters to diligence and faithfulnessin their labors, though they are sometimes heavyall the organizations are of God; the younger gene[page torn]ation must bear off the kingdom; Let us be care-ful and watchful of their teachings. He closedhis remarks by asking the blessing of our heavenlyFather upon all. 
 Pres. Woodruff said the church of Christhas been set us again for the last time, it has been or-ganized for 63 years, and yet we are only a handfulcompared with the world at large. But the eye of Godupon us, and the hosts of heaven and of this world too,are watching us. Then what manner of men, women,and children should we be; we should be saints indeed,and strive to live every righteous principle, in an ac-ceptable manner before God.The Relief Society was organised by theProphet Joseph Smith in an early day, for a purpose:that of love and charity for the sick and hungry; andthey are doing a noble work in this direction. Thesisters have rights which the brethren should sustain.They have been called by revelation to store wheat againstthe time of famine, and we should sustain them in this call.We must improve our time, for we know not theday nor the hour when we will be called to labor beyondthe vail. The evil one is ever watching to lead away anddeceive the young and inexperienced; and we must beprayerful and humble and on our guard at all timesand shun vice and even the appearance of evil.We have one of the most glorious blessing thatany people can enjoy; that of working for the dead. I havehad the privilege of working for the redemption of overfour thousand of my relatives and friends in the spiritworld. I exhort you to faithfulness in this grand work,an in every labor you are called to perform. 
 CALIFORNIA  MISSION612 VanNess Ave. SanFrancisco Cal.Jan. 1st 1897President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City Utah.Dear Brother;I arrived in SanFrancisco nov. 15th and was cordially recei-ved by President Tanner; who started for home Nov. 24th. Untillthen I took no active part; but proceeded to make myself as wellacquanted with the situation as the circumstances would admit of, in that length of time: I found that the Elders wereGrouped together,in places about as follows. Seven at SanFrancisco; five at SanDiego, five at Los Angeles, four at San Jose, four at Sacramento, two at Latorobe, and two at River-side. They were hiring theirown Rooms, in each place; buying their own food, and in some instan-ces cooking it. The actual time spent among the people distribut-ing cards, and Tracts, was from three to four [illegible] hours [illegible]each day. It did not seem to me that this was the most profitableway to work: accordingly as soon as President Tanner bid us adeauI got the Elders together who were laboring here and discussed wi[th]them the situation, laying before them the necessity of travelingin the Lords own appointed way.With-out purse or scrip.After this I went to San Jose and aroused the Elders there on thesame question; I then went to Sacramento and took up a labor the[r]ewith the Elders. On my return I issued a circular letter to allthe Elders, of which I here-with enclose you a copy that you may sesee by what means I have reached the preasant conditions. The re-ssult was, that several of the Elders anounced themselves ready totake the field. We met together, and after prayer and supplicationbefore the Lord, two were appointed from San Francisco, to Salinas,Monteray County; Two from San Jose, to Hollister, SanBenito Coun-[illegible] ty; and two from Sacramento, to Napa City, Napa County.Opening up new fields.This was all new ground upon which the Elders had not trod.In the lower part of the State alike course was persued; the group-es have been scattered by 2's, the head-quarters have been brokenup; and now, six pairs of Elders are traveling absolutely with-outpurse or scrip. All the others are moveing steadily in that direct-[ion].The reports that have reached me from those Elders that have aris-en to the true standard of Missionary life and labor, are of themost incourageing nature; they are often entertained at the bestHotels. Opera-houses, Churches, Halls, and School-houses, havebeen provided repetedly. News-papers have advertised their Meet-ings free. Friends have been raised up who administered to theirwants and on their departure bid them wellcome to return. Manyhave listened to the truth that could not have been reached by theother system.The Elders declare they have not gone hungry, or needed a 
 CALIFORNIA MISSION532 Castro St. San Francisco Cal. March 1st, 1897.President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother;With a desire to let you know the presant condition of theMission I write. On the 9th of January I started on a tour Southand visited that part of the State. I found that the Elders wereall traveling in the Lords appointed way, traveling without purseor scrip, except such as had their Wives with them, who ofcourse wewere keeping house. I visited all the Elders, and examined theirmode of presenting the Gospel, and gave them such instructions asseemed to be necessary, that they might be able to handle the Scriptures into the best advantage in teaching the doctrines of the Church,all now testify that it has helped them much and that a more effect-ual work will be performed in the future.At Los Angeles the Branch is in a good condition. Agoodspirit prevails. The Saints meet together in testimony meetings, &rejoice in the Gosplel. They expect to lead six or eight down intothe waters of Baptism dureing the coming week. They have been hold-ing outdoor meetings on the Streets when the weather would admit,and have good sized congregations and fairly good attention. Two ofthose about to be Baptized, a Lady and a Gentleman will be added toour numbers as a direct result of Street preaching: this is quit anincouragement to the Elders in that line of labor. A similar satate-ment may be made of the situation in San Diego only that the Bran-ch is not so strong. At Sacramento the Branch is about to receivean increase of several new members by Baptism, and a goodytly numbere of strangers are attending our meetings trhere, and the spirit of in-vestigation seems to nbe growing.The Elders who went out into new ground, as shown in my lastreport, have met with all the incouragement that was hoped for. Onereport from the southern part of the State says among other things, "If one wants to get well fed, travel without purse or scrip, Itel I tell you, they will nearly cram you to death". The report fromNapa County says, they get three meals a day and a good bed at nigh night; and are generally invited to retursn. From San Benito andMonteray Counties a similar voice is heard. I havejust returnedfrom Salinas in Monteray County, where we preached in a Hall and onthe streets last Sunday; a good feeling prevails towards the eldersand the prospects are good for a bright for a good work to be donethere.At San Jose the Elders have been laboring for some time with a nu number of investigators and they expect to Baptize 7 or 8 in the nnear furture. As soon as the weather woill admit I sahall go out thereand heplp the Eldesrs in their outdoor preaching and make things aslively as I can posable possible.Here in San Francicsco the work is steadily moving along; 
 bed; and they are spending their whole time among the people inst-ead of from three to five hours out of the twenty four. All areare rejoicing in the new move, and testify that the blessings thatthey daily receive in the opporations of the Holy Spirit are richand rare beyond anything they have ever expeariensed before.The Hall at San Jose has been discontinued; as I believe itstood in the way of a better mode-that of secureing meetings inprivate houses, and thereby giving us a better chance to reach thepeople. It has also cut off some expense.Many good earnest people are investigating the truths of thegospel, and as time rolls on we hope to gather them into the fold;and I fully expect the California Mission to become self-suportingin the near future.The whole Statelies before us, and all that is necessary to handle it, is a suf-ficient number of Elders. There is room for a pair of Elders inevery county, and in each large City in the State; and if itshould be the mind and will of the Lord to send us twice or threetimes the number of Elders that we now have, we can soon put thisMission in a prosperous condition. I have not a doubt that theycan travel in every part of the State, with-out purse or scrip:and be treated as gentlemen where ever they go. And now Dear Bro-ther, if you will kindly indulge me, I will say, that well educat-ed, bright, and inteligent young men, are the only ones that canhope to sucseed in theis mission.Out-door preachingis now being pushed with vigor by the Elders in San Diego; and asa consequence their hall every Sabath envening is filled to over-flowing. This mode of preaching the Gospel has been resorted to insome instances in this northern part of the State, and will becomegeneral as soon as the rainy season is past and the weather becom-es more pleasant. Our Hall here in San Francisco is well filled revery Sunday night and sometimes standing room is in demand.The News-papersthroughout the State are treating us with fair consideration. Inmany instances publishing a synopsis of our sermons, and also oth-er articals that we prepare for them, all of which is having a goodeffect, and paving the way for us, through-out the State.The Southern-Pacific CompanyMr J. C. Stubbs, 3 rd Vice President, and general Freight Agent ofthe Company invited me to an interview, for the purpose of talkingover the dificulties that existed between the Rail Road people ^hear^, &the Brethren at Salt Lake City, in relation to the transportationof the Elders over the Southern Pacific to and from San Francisco.The interview, however was interupted before it was concluded, byhis with-drawing from [illegible] the room, and we retired. I afterwardwrote him, stating our situation, the work we are doing, andthat which we expect to do; and that it was verry desirable that Ishould be able to travel all over the State, to look after the Elders 
 many strangers attend our meetings and we have all the investigator^s^at presant that we are able to attend to with our limited force ofElders. Four have been baptized since my last report, and a numberof others have announced themselves as about ready to come into thefold.I deeply appreciate the courtesies extended to me by the SouthernPacific Company which greatly facilitates my movements, and thusenables me to visit all the Elders in every part of the State andassist them in the prosecution of their missionary labors.A great field lies before us. The Harvest is indeed greta^t^and the laborers are few; and in the distribution of new missionar-ies we devoutly hope that 40 or 50 will fall to our portion. Wecan comfortably take care of that number dureing the coming spring.I earnestly congratulate you Dear Brother on your having livedto behold the ushering in of the 91st year of your life, and de-voutly hope that you may be spared as long as this life shall besweet unto you.Ever praying for your welfare I remain,Your Brother in the Gospel,E.

 and to embrace every opportunity to place more of them in theState; and in order that I might do this more effectually I desir-ed a free anual Pass over all their Roads in the State, as wellas a regular Half Fare Clergyman's Permit for any of the Elders wh at any time that I might desire to move them from place to place.In answer to this letter I received another yesterday from MrStubbs regretting the fact that the interview was interupted andinviting me to call on him again, next tuesday. I took the liber-ty to say to Mr Stubbs, that if I could report to the Presidencyat Salt Lake City, that the Southern Pacific Company, was treat-ing me and our Elders in this State with courtesy and considerat-ion, it would have the immediate effect of turning all the travelof our Elders to and from San Francisco, over their road.I fully expect to get my pass, and I need it very muchthat I may travil through-out the State, and encourage the Eldersin the good work of spreading the Gospel. I will let you know immed-iately, wheather I sucseed or not.I devoutly hope that the course I have persued willmeet your approbation, and any sugestions you have to offer, or anyinstructions that you may see fit to favor me hwith, I will do myutmost to carry them out, according to the Spirit and the ltetterthere-ofI here-with submit you our financial and Tithing report for the la[st]six weeks, trusting that it will meet your approvalAnd now with profound respectI remain your Brother in the Gospel E.

Her health is very poor; she desi^res^to make a trip to Salt Lake City, and work in the Temple, and afterwards return to Sacramento. As there is no Bishop here, to giveher a recomend, is there any way by which she can secure the need^-^ed Recomend to admit her to the Temple?

If there is any waythat this Sister can be admited to the Temple to work for her deadand gain a blessing for her self, please instruct me. She is said toto be, by the local President and the traveling Elders, worthy of allacceptation. She lives in hopes of being healed, if she can be per-mited to go into the Temple.All is well in the Mission and our prospects are brightfor bringing many honest Souls into the fold.Praying that you may live long, Your Brother, E.

 CALIFORNIA MISSION532 Castro St. San Francisco Cal.Jan. 30th, 1897.President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:I greatly fear that my letter of the 8th to you, has con-veyed a wrong impression in relation to my arrangement with theSouthern Pacific Company. Such at least, Brother Reynolds letter ofthe 12th seems to indicate. I was aware before I came here thatsome trouble had existed between the Company and the Brethren atSalt Lake City about the transportation of our Elders over theirRoad. When I was introduced by President Shurtliff to Mr J. C. Stubbs he refered to that difficulty and invited me to an interviewfor the purpose of talking it over; and if possable bring abouta better understanding on the subject. When I went to that interviwewI asked no favors; I promised nothing. I went with the determinat-ion to secure the best conditions possable for all our Elders mov-ing from place to place throughout the State or traveling to andfrom Ogden. I stated that all we asked for all our Elders was the s same priveileges freely accorded to all other ministers of all ot-her donominations the Clergymans half-fare-permit. But in relationto my self, having been appointed President of this Mission it wasnecessary that I should travel all over the State, and to facilitat^e^my movements and enable me tovisitevery town and city through^ou^t theState and thus open up new fields to preach the Gospel and by sodoing be enabled to place many more of our Elders in the Missionaryservice, a free annual pass would be of great benifit to the workin which I was engaged, and would result in greatly increased tra-vel of our Elders over their Road. That all these Elders had tocome from Utah ^,I said^ "they can come over your raoad from Ogden, theycan go the other way, I have got a man to send home to morrow mor-ning, I can send him the other way" Mr Stubbs and Mr Donalson wh^o^was with him then refered to the unpleasantness that occured sometime ago, evidently with some feeling, and appearantly with deepregret; stating that such occurances must be avoided in the fut-ure: that they would issue the half-fare-permits to such as were eentitled to them who applied directly through me; this they requir-ed for their protection and to this I agreed. I had suggested thatif they treated me and my fellow laborers with consideration andcourtesy it would have the effect of removing the unpleasantnessesof the past and would doubtless secure the good will of the Pre-sidency at S. L. C. Mr Stubbs then said he would recomend to his c committee that the pass be issued for six months. It was expresslyunderstood, that all Elders, wheather they were returning homefrom this, or from any of the Iland Missions, desiring to obtainthe half-fare-permit, must apply for it through me; this was theonly condition made. I said nothing that could in any way bind the

 See overCALIFORNIA MISSION612 Van Ness Ave. San Francisco, Cal.Jan. 8th, 1897President Wilford WoodruffSaltLake City, Utah.Dear Brother:I take great pleasure in reporting the fact to you, that I have just completed arrangments with the Southern Pacific Company by which they have issued to me a  :Free aannual Pass: and ^will call^ to all our Elders throughuout the State and to and from Ogden a Clergy-man^'s^half-fare-permit; under the following conditions. That in all^ ^cases either for Elders laboring in this mission directly under my control^,^or Elders reteurning from any of the Ilands Missions who desire to avail themselves of this privelege s theyshall make application to the Company directyly through me; and for whom-so-ever I ask this favor, they will grant it. After a long interview with Mr. J. C.Stubbs 3rd Vice-President, on the 5th, and another with Mr. Donald-son his assistant, to day, this is the result. They requir the conditions above refered to as a protection to them against any of our people who might under-take to secure th^e^se privelegeds without being justly entitled to them. They hope, in consideration of the favors thus extended by them to us, especially the free annuall pass to me over all their roads in the State, that the good will of the Presidency at Salt Lake City will be secured and tha t all the Elders traveling to and from the Ilands as well as such as come to this mission will patronize their Road from Ogden to San Francisco.I hope Dear Brother, that what I have done in this matter will meet your Iapprobationorrow for Los Angeles your approbation.I start to morrow for Los Angeles to visit the Elders in the Southern part of the State. I expect to be gone two or three ^weeks,^if you have any word for me, kindly send it to this place and it will be forwarded to me.All the Elders but five in this mission are now traveling with out purse or scrip and the finest reports continue to come in from them. tThey declare they are are treated royally on allmost every hand. Spending their whole time among the people and making many friends. All the Elders are full of praise and thanksgiving to the almighty for the change that has been made and are looking for rich returns in the future as a result of the presant mode of laboring among the people.Four of the presant force of Elders in the mission will have been here two years in the Spring. We shall need others to filtheir place^s^; beside this, there are 56 Counties in the State;there is room for a pair of Elders in every County. I am fully per-suaded sway^ua^ded that the elders can travil in every part of the SttState without purse or scrip and be treated as Gentlemen. I am redready to use any number of elders that you may  see fit to send me.Devoutly praying for blessings upon you all, your Brother E.H.Nye 
 Presidency or any of the Brethren to travel this way, when it was desirable to go the other, or at all, only so far as to state, that the good will of the Presidency  and the Brethren generally could be secured by kind treatment on the part of the company of our El-ders in this Mission. I did not consider that I had any authorityto make any promises that could hamper or bind the Presidency, and,made none. I deeply regret that my letter was so worded as to con-vey the impression that I had exceeded the bounds of proprietyand I sincerely trust that this statement of the situation will be satisfactory. I candidly confess that I was highly elated at mysucsess in securing my pass all over the State for one year (it is a regular annual pass) and a pleasant arrangement with the company by which I could move the Elders all over the state with out any friction with the company, on the half-fare-permit: in fact, all the benifits are ours, while we are under no obligations.The tracts refered to we obtained from President E. S. Kimball of the Southern States Mission and have paid the cash for them. President Tanner Gave me no information in relation to obtaining Tracts; ha^e^nce I was wholly ignorent upon that point and vvery thankful to know that you can supply us; can you also supply us with the Voice of Warning? we now get them from the South post paid at 12/2 cents; we are very much in need of a good supply of them.We now have 28 elders and three Sisters in the Misssion. 8 of the Brethren and the Sisters, are according to the gen-eral rules entitled to a release in the near future, the Brethren having been in the Mission from 19 to 22 22 months. This Mission here-to-fore has been a heavy expense to the Elders and some of them feel that it is a hardship to hold them here much longer; es-pecially in view of the fact that from some source they have been led to believe that this Mission would release them in 18 months because of its having been so expensive.If it is designed to push matters forward in this Missin I can proffitably use 40 or 50 new Elders in the next three months and still more as the time wears on. Will you kindly let me know wawhat I may look for in relation to this matter.In San Diego there is a Negro who desires to be Baptisedhe is a Minister, a whole-souled fellow; will you please instruct e me what to do in relation to him.Our prospects are very bright, the most encouraging repot^rts^ continue to come in from all parts where the elders are laboring.I released Elder A. N. Murdock on the 14th to return home on account of poor health and bodily afflictions.And now dear Brother, praying for heavens richest blessin^g^to rest upon you and with the most profound respectI remain your BrotherE.

April 9th, 1897.President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother;I here with enslose you a financial report of the^i^sMission for last month. After carefull consideration we find thatit is cheaper to rent unfurnished Rooms and provide our own Fur-niture than to rent furnished rRooms: Hence we have bought some Fur-niture and in so doing, we have had to borrow from some of theElders, who are now in need of their money. The Tithing last monthfell considerably short of what it was the two months previous, butwe feel sure that it will come up again much better as the time rooll^s^on; especially as a goodly number of good a desirable class of people have recently been baptized. If you will kindly help us outto the amount of our deficiency so that we can pay the Brethrenwhat we owe them, it will relieve us of our embarrassment and willI assure you be deeply appreciated.Our Northern Conferance will convene in this City, SundayMorning April 11th, and our Southern Conferance in San Diego April25th after which I will send you a full report of our condition.Ever praying the choicest blessings of heaven upon youI remain, Very truly your Brother,E.

 Haifa Palestine Sept 16th 1892The First Presidency Salt Lake CityMy dear Brethern!Your highly appreciated letter of July 29th came to hand just as I was leaveing Constantinople. You will understand from this that I dident leave when I first expected to, but was, for several reasons, delayed. The principle reason of my delay was the fact the tracts I had ordered inVienna did not turn out as I had expectedthey would. Shortly after my writing my last letter,I was informed, through Mr Baichel, the agent through whom I had ordered, that the tracts had been confiscated before leaveing the Vienna house. "The manuscript" said B "Has been savedand sent to Leipzig whare the tracts will be re-printed without any extra cost to you." A day or so after bringing this intellegence, Mr. B. called again this time to say he had been sus-pected as being the one who sent the orders to the Vienna house and, as a consiquence had been summoned to appear before an investigating board of Turkish Officials, whare, to shield himself and me, he denied all knowledge of the same, whare upon, th board telegraphed to 
 have the Vienna firm arrested and made to dis-close who sent in the order. The firm were placed under arrest and bonds were fixed at 12 pounds. They were given two days to answer in. The Vienna people wired B to learn if he wouldforfeit the 12 pounds or have his name revealed."And now" Said B "I have come to find out if your will pay the forfeiture." As I was tired of paying out money on those tracts I told him no I certainly would not pay a nother cent on them. He said "Mr Musser if you dont pay that fine I will send in your name as being the one who gave me the manuscript" "I will get off all right"said he "but you will have four or five years to stay in Turkey" I told him I had no objections to his dooing just as he felt was right all that I would insist upon was his furnishing me the tracts I had paid for, and on his return-ing to me 6 pounds I had loned him while he was in distress and for I held his note. At this he became very boisterous and left threatening to telegraph my name right off to ViennaI hardely knew what to do. I thought it was possible he could get me in to trouble stillI felt sure he was acting dishonestly and that it would be a sin to meet his demands 
 Jaffa April 2and 1893First Presidency Salt Lake City U.S.A.Dear Brethern:I am in receipt of your favor of Feb. 14th. with enclosed Imperial Ottoman Bank draft No. 2887 for 500.00, Five hundred, francs.  In your above refered to letter you ask me to send you a few copies of the tracts I have had prin-ted.  Oon the 15th of last September I addressed a communication to you, in which I explained how it was I was unsuc-cesful in obtaining the tracts I had ordered, and paid for, at Austria. Since then I have heard nothing of them.  Through the kindness of a Mr Heilpern I have a letter of introduction to a publishing house in Jerusalem whare, I am assured by Mr. Heilpern, I will be able to get our tracts printed without dif-ficulty and at the usual charges.As soon as practicable I will go to Jerusalem and see what I can do.I am pleased to hear we are to have a nother missionary in this part of the field, and that there are steps being taken at home in the way of educateing elders for this 
 Haifa July 24th. 1893First PresidencySalt Lake CityUtah.Dear Brethern:I have at last succeeded in get-ting some of our tracts printed in the arabic language a few coppies of which I herein enclose They were printed at Jerusalem by a Jew at a cost of 100.00 frs per 2000.The Christians of Jerusalemwould not permit themunder any considerationthough I gave them all a chance. It was through the kindness of Mr. Jos. Schore a Jewish proselyte and manager of the Church of 
 England press at the "Holy City" that I was successful in getting the Jew to permit them.Bro Huish has been here for some time and we have decided that he should return with Bro Herman, who has also been here for a week or so, to the north and labor in and a bout Aintab.  I think we need a German speaking Elder in this part of the vineyard just as soon as ^is^ possibleto get one Bro Herman re-ports very good success from in Aleppo and Aintab.  A number have recently embraced the truth and the saints are enjoying 
 for more money. I wrote President Young for instructions and decided in the mean time to let matters run there course. Prest Young ad-vised me to go Haifa but at this time Haifa was quarantined on account of cholera hence I had to remain in Constantinople four or five weeks longer. In the meantime Bro Haag arrived fromSchwitzerland. Bro Herman had taken his depart-ure for Aintab some time before this. I had tried several times to see Mr Baichel but was unsuccessful untill one day I ran across him on the street. He surprised me by saying he had fixed everything "OK" in regards the tracts and that they would be here in the course of a week or ten days. Two weeks after this I was informed by the steam ship company that the quarantine at Haifa had been raised I had not yet received the tracts and could get no trace of Baichelso I decided I had been defrauded and ratherthen waste any more time I would take Bro Haag and go into Palestine. The morning we left B. called on us to ask what he should do with the tracts when th came, as he was expecting them everyday I told him when they came hecould forward them to my address in PalestineThis he promised to do. It is now over four weeks 
 Mount Carml Hospitalnear Haifa, ^Turkey^ Oct 4th 1892The First Presidency Salt Lake City My dear Brethern!Refering to the desmise of our beloved Brother & fellow worker in the cause of truth, Adolf Haag, I will say he died of typhus yeasterday morning at five minutes past four.On the 16th of September, the day after I addressed you my last letter, Bro Haag was a gain taken ill and, not withstanding every thing, that human love and skill could suggest for his good, being done, he gradualy sank lower & lower untill the Angle of rest was sent to loosen the bands holding him to this earth of sorrow & pain, and bid his soul "Assend on high and be rewardedfor the labors you have so willingly, and faith-fuly preformed." I was with him from th time he was taken sick untill his spirit was waftedabove, and not once did I hear him complain I did not, I could not think he was so seriously ill.Not even when he got so weak I had to feed him and lift him from one bed to the other, did I realize Iwould soon have to part with my energetic & noble companion. And even now, after seeing 
 mission.I will send part of the 500.00 frs. to Elder Herman who, by the by, is well and reports some success in Aintab and there a bouts.With many thanks for your consideration,I remainYour Brother Don C. W. MusserJust so.J. F. S.[sideways text]D. C. W. MusserApr. 2nd 1893.[End of sidways text] 
 the blessings of the Gosp^e^leBefore Bro Gran left Haifa he gave me an order on a gentleman that has charge of his property here with which I can draw what money I need.On this account I have paid Bro Herman up to date 457.99 francs. Of course this amount I will have to report to Bro Gran who is now on his way to Utah and he will be very apt to visit you with this report and you will under stand from this, what it is.I realize I have no au-thority to pay the expenses of traveling elders inthis mission. But as 
 since then and I have heard nothing of the tracts or Mr Baichel.I was told by all the steam ship agents that the cheapest way I would possibly get to Haifa was via Alexandria and Port Said. I purchased tickets to Alexandria. Upon our arrival here we were told we would have to wait five days before we could get a ship for Palestine. We therefore decided to go by way of Cairo and see the Pyramids thence direct up the celebrated Sues Canal to Port Said. Arriving at Port Said in we had three more days to wait dooring which time I was very sick. On Saturday the ship arrived at Port Said and just at the last minutethe agent at this place received a telegram say-ing the quarantine had not yet been raised at Haifa and cansiquently not to sell tickets for this station. So the nearest we could get to our destination was Jappa, two days journey with horses. I fear my letter is getting rather long so I will close. I will add however that our ride from Jappa to Haifa cost us 100.00 frs. Bro Haags health is not good I have written particulars to Prest Youngand I think Bro Haag will be removed from this to the German mission. In which case we would need another German speaking Elder here. I am very pleased with the outlook here in this part of 
 [sideways text]D. C. W. MusserJan. 7 [18]93.[end of sideways text]Jerusalem January 7th 1893First PresidencySalt Lake CityUtah U. S. A.My dear Brethern:You, doubtless, would like to hear something from the "Turkish Mission."  I am sorry to have kept you waiting so long, but the fact of the matter is, I have had nothing of importance to communicate, and, therefore, thought it best not to write.  Shortly after my companion's death I had the pleasure of baptiseing two souls,sisters, at Haifa. I then came to Jaffa whare I baptised a nother sister, a blind lady.  These are all germen people.  I havent, as yet, adminis-tered baptisn to any of the native Aribs, though I have had one or two applicants.  After Bro Haag's dismiss I thought I had better stay in this part of the country as our saints here have been left a long time with out an elder.  Preveious to this I had been studying the turkish language.But as that is not spoken here, Arabic being the tongue, I droped the former and took up the latter study, which I find extremely difficult.Unlike other languages, one must first learnthe grammer before he can read correctly.  My desire was, and still is, to master this languagethat I might become proficient to teach others it.With this in view I employed a teacher, but after a short time, on account of my finances, I was forced to dispense with him.  Since then my progress has been slow.Since comeing here I have made a 
 his thin pleasant face fixed in death, after our long ride to the cemetery listening to the doleful music of the villi^a^ge bell made to toll as a mark of respect for the man of God, who had left all behind to fallow Jesus. After beholding the body of clay being returned to mother earth, and seeing the flowers that were so loveingly prepaired to strew on his grave, it is hard for me to realize that he is gone and I am a lone.Bro Haag, though here but a short time, had made a host of friends as evidenced by the large concourseof people, all anxious to share ^there^ sympathies by coming to the funerall. Amomg whom I saw the German Consulate & his wife, who by th by have been very kind to us, the Mayer of Haifa who entertamed us all oneafternoon listening to our testimonies and, in fact, nearly every one in the colony was in attendanceYou will see by the heading of this letter that I am in the hospital. This is a house built ontop of Mount Carml whare people came to get the benifits of the fresh mountain air. By order of the Doctor, I brought Bro Haag here but it didentseem to be just the thing for him so last Friday theDr had us move him back to the colony whare he couldget to see him oftener, and where he afterwards hidin Bro Gran's house. After the funeral the Doctorsaid it would be absolutely necessary for me 
 long as the Elders stand in need and ask for help and I have some way of getting money I am a fraid I will have to render assistence.Hopeing that my actions in this respect will be approvedI remainyour Brother in truth Don C.

 the mission. We have three, and perhaps more,babtisems to preform in the near future.I should have written at an earlier date but was waiting something definite to write a bout.  I am extremely sorry a bout those tracts as we needthem very much. We have so much liberty otherwise in this country.Ever praying for the blessings of the Lord to be with you.I remain Your Brother Don. C. W. MusserP.S.

 prayful study of the condition ant out look of this mission, which is not yet opened up.A few Aribs in this country, i.e. three, have been bap-tised.  One of them, a sister, died in the church the other two, brethern, are still in Jaffa and as unfameliar with the requirements and bless-ings of the Gospel as it was possible for them to be before they were baptised.  They bothclaim they were were promiced means to eme-grate with on con ditions that they would be baptised.  This seems to have been there only ob-ject.  One of them is very dishonest and an an ideler from the word go.  He has said a great many meen things about our church, and lately avoids me, almost as much, if not quite, as he would a serpent.  When I do get a chance to talk with him, which is not often, I cant make him understand, though he speaks a little english.  I will have to wait untill I cantalk his language before I can do any thing with him.There is an enormous work to be done here, and I feel confident that now is the time to be dooing it.  But how to make an opening, seems to me to be the all important question.  Might I offer a suggestion I would say send out more missionaries, say six for palestine, with instructions to proceed to Jaffa, there employ a teacher and devote your whole time to the study Arabic.  Our elders could master the lang uage enough, in one year, to enable to preach and con-verse.  At the end of the first year send out six 
 to return to the mountain unless I wanted to get sick, and, as I felt that this was the case,I decided to com right up. I shall stay here a week or so to rest and recruit up.I have just finished letters to Prest Young and to Bro Richard Haag of Salt Lake and as I know of nothing more of importance to communicate at present I will bring my brief to a closePraying the Lord to bless you I remain your Brother in the covenant of truthDon C. W. MusserI will add that Bro Herman is well and reports everything in good condition at AintabD. C. W. M.

 more elders with the same instructionsOne of the first six would be able to teach those who arrived last thereby cutting off one ex-pense.  After a person learns the language he can live here as cheap as any other part of the world.  And after the mission began to be opened up it would be more self surportingThe various missionaries in Palestine are meeting with but poorl success.  They buy what converts they get and pay high prices for them.  The Catholics & Greeks haveing the most money get the most converts.  Of course when the pure Gospel of Christ, with its blessings and gifts is introduced by humble and authorized servants there will be a great many of the honest brought to light.  A great many of those who are anxious to serve the Lord for I beleave they are here.  If the above course was persued, I think in three years time the turkish missionwould be self surporting.  But if things are leftas they are at present, with one elder in this whole reagion, and be unfameliar with the language. I beleave the turkish mission will remain undeveloped.  I trust you will please pardon these few suggestions.Now I wish to say a few words regarding my labor which, at times, seems almost to be in vain.  My progress is slow and the opposition I encounter would be discourage-ing did I not know I am engaged in the Lord's cause.  My expences have been very high and are high at the present writing, but it seems I cant better matters in this respect. 
 D. C. W. MusserOct. 4 [18]92. 
 On the 30th of November I wrote to Prest Young setting forth my desire to travel with out Purse & Scrip.I said, among other things, that if he thought it wisdom, I would send him what money I had.  I havent received a reply from Prest young but I have learned I cant travel with out money.  I dont doubt the Lord for I know I am the recepient of rich blessings from Him every hour in the day, and were it not for His spirit I enjoy, I could not stay here.  As Isaid in one of my previous letters, I love to tell people we mormon elders travel on our own means, We pay all of our expenses from our own pockets. We do not "preach for money and devine for hire."  But my means have long since been exhausted and I have no way of obtaining more.  I am perfectly willing to give my note for every cent of Church money I use,while engaged in this work.  And I hopethat on this condition you will kindly advance me more money.Bro Herman is laboring with the Turksand Armenians at Aintab & there a bouts.  He reports everything "OK" though he needs a companion the worst kind.  It is not necessary for missionaries, laboring in that part of the field,to understand German.Hopeing to here from you soon, and begging your pardon for this lengthy letter, and praying the Lord to bless you I remainYour Brother in the GospelDon.

Feb'ry. 9th, 1876.My dear Brother:Your very welcome favor of the 20th instult.came duly to hand. I was very glad to receive it. I havewritten very fully to the President, and I thought it like-ly that you would hear them ^letters^ read. It is scarcely clear yet as to what Congress will do in our case.The bill before the House is to give us a newelection law. This is a "Ring" Bill and iswas broughtor sent down by my contestant. I do not want to see it or any other Bill ^of theirs^ become law. We are capable of governing ourselves. The result to be gained bythe passage of these Bills is not concealed. The "ring"say to Congress, "give us the legislation we want andwe will control Utah and settle the Mormon questionwhich vexes the nation." In other words, "Bind the Mor-mon people hand and foot, give us control of them andwe will dispose of them." If the Lord is willing that this shall be done, Congress, no doubt, will enact the necessary 
 legislation. But I have not yet received any intimationthat the Lord is willing to sSuffer any such evils to fallupon us.I have watched your proceedings in the As-sembly with great interest. You have had, appa-rently, a quiet time. If there be any conflict, I suppose we shall hear of it toward the close of the Session. I trust that your labors will be of benefit to the Territory and satisfactory to yourselves.The war against us will go on, I expect, until we are vic-torious. But I do earnestly desire and yearn for the time to come when we shall enjoy our full rights as citizens under the Constitution; when we shall be freefrom the yoke that our enemies seek to fasten us. TheLord has made it light to us, or it would be unbearable.Now for 28 years we have been in the Mountains, and we have shown our capacity for self-government and we should have the privilege of electing our own officers. Ibelieve the day is not far distant when we shall have greaterliberty than we have at present. Enclosed please find a letterfor Bro. Erastus Snow, which oblige me by handing to him if in the city;if he has left, please send to him. I send it open that you may read some items that may be of interest to you. With love to yourself and our mutualfriends and kind regards to your family, I am Your Brother, Geo. Q. Cannon

 Excellent letter. J.F.S.CALIFORNIA MISSION 915 Golden Gate Ave. San Francisco, Calif.Jan. 1st, 1898.President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother;I take pleasure in reporting to you the condition of theCalifornia mission at the presant and for the year 1897 just closed.There are now two well organized Branches; one in this city and one in Los Angeles. These have a President with his counselors,Elders, Priest Teachers and Deacons. Ladies relief and Mutuel Impr-vement Associations, and Sabbath Schools. Sacramento has a Branch wiwith a Presiding Elder, but is without helps as there are not suitable men to fill the offices at presant, but we hope to be able to com-pleate the organization as the time rolls on; it has a good ladies relief association and a good little Sabbath school. San diego has a goodly number of Saints but is as yet unorhganized; though they hahave a good sabbath school. There is also a Sabbath Sachool at Lat-trobe in Eldorado county, composed ocf children of non membes presided over by one of our local elders and hassisted by his wifeTheir tsutuddies are entirely from our works obtained from Geo.Q. Cannon & Sons Company.During the year we have led into the waters of Baptism onehundred and forty nine; these have been principally in the cities of San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego; with a few in SSan Jose and Oakland.The Elders are now traveling without purse or scrip in 20 counties; 13 of which have been opened up during the last year, and while we are used well in most instances in all the localities refered to yet aso far, but few baptisms have been recorded in any of these counties; still there are many friends rising up on every hand, and a warm welcome extended to the Elders in many places.The Josephites are our most active opponants. Two of the El-ders were recently 'Trap'd' by them. They were overtaken one day by a carriage with two occupants and asked to ride; and on learning who they were an invitation was given to attend a meeting at which it wawas thought they would be able to speak to the people. On reaching ththe meeting house and the one who invited them began to speak they discovered that he was the gGreat 'Elder Daily' of the 'Reorganized'church, and our bitterest enemy. His whole speach consisted of a string of horrors, laid at the door of the Mormons. At the clost ofwwhich, Elder knight reached and took him by the hand and shook himheartily and while doing so, turned to the audience and repeted the wordsof the Saviour, Mat.5.44. At the close of the meeting many of the audience came tand shook the boys heartily and asked them to their houses while Mr. Daily looked and acted as though he had made a mistake.The News Papers have been fair in their treatment towarxds us throug^ou^t the state in most instances; notably the 'Call' and 'Post' of this city and the 'Fresno Republican' and several others in the 
 CALIFORNIA MISSION.915 GOLDEN Gate Ave. San Francisco, Calif.June 1st, D 1898.President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.Daer Brother;On my return from the general conferance at Salt Lake City, weheld our conferance in this city; April 17th and 18th. Quite a numbercame from Oakland San Jose and Sacramento, and the meetings were well aattended during both ^days^ of our conferance. The spirit of the Lord rested upon the Elders, the Saints were instructed and the strangers haeard thethe Gospel.After our Priesthood meeting, and the buisness affairs of the con-ferance where adjusted I went to Los Angeles and there we held anothertwo day's conferance, April 24, & 25 which was another Grand sucsess.I then visited San Diego and there we organized a branch, a Ladies re-lief society and a primary association. There are about 60 members in the branch which would have been organized some time ago but for the llack of suitable material of which to form a presidency. It is now in good condition and ^has^ bright prospects before it.The Los Angeles branch is becoming thrifty and strong; at this lanst monthly Priesthood meeting there was 19 members of the local PtPriesthood president. They have a fine ladies Relief society, a mutual-Improvment association, that has a weekoly attendance of 60 or 70 per-sons, many of whom are investigators.  They have a good sunday Schooland on the occasion of my last visit they had 29 little children and larger boys and girls and Teachersa, about 50 all told. We cannot speakso waell of San Francisco the middle and northern parts of the state as of the southern portion. Why we do not know. The Elders are work-ing hard and faithfully but an indifferance seems to exist and as a consequence progress is slow. Some of the counties in the great wheat producing parts of the state we have had to adbandon for the presant on account of the terrible drouth that prevails all through that portion of the state as so many of the people have had to leave for other parts in order to make a living for the season. Of course it is tthe working classaes as a rule that are our best friends, and they a^are^ the ones that have had to seek employment else where.On my return from the southern part of the mission I went to San Jose and had an interview with Brother Keller the author 
 CALIFORNIA MISSION508 Fulton St. Saln Francisco, Calif.May, 10th, 1897.President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:I take great pleasure in reporting to you the presant condit-ion of thids Mission. Since my last report I have visited many partsof the State and labored with the Elders in their several fields.We held Conferance in San Francisco on the 11th of April and onthe 25th in San Diego. Reports from all the Elders make clear thefact, that traveling in the Lords appointed waly-without purse orscrip-is by far the most desirable; by it the Elders have access topeople they could reach in no other way and they are being treatdwell. They find no difficulty in reaching the people. Occasionallythey meet a 'Crank' or a 'Sore-head' barely enough to give var-iety to missionary life.The wokrk at Los Angeles has grown rapidly since my lastreport. About 18 or 20 have been Baptized. On the 21st of April wehad the pleasure of organizeing the Branch there; prior to that timthere had been but a presiding Elder there, but they now rejoicein a Branch with a President and his councilors and members ofthe lesser priesthood all in good working order. On the 7th of Maywe organized the Ladies Relief association, and the Mutual Improve-men association on the same evening; and as there is a good sunday-school there, Los Angeles can now be said to be in a good, prosperouscondition. The Branch has 57 dgood active members and a bright pros-pect for a number being added in the near future.I have been out with the Elders in several parts fothe mission, shareing with them the joys and fatigues ovf the missioary work; waklking and visiting by day and Preaching to good congre-gations at night; and seeing for myself the way in which our Eldersare received and treated by the people; and it seems to me that awonderfull future lies before us and the only thing necessary to bedone, to bring hosts of good people into the fold, is, aided by thespirit of the Lord, to work, work, work.We now have a continuous line of Elders from San Franciscoto San Diego in the Coast Counties; and as the time rolls on, hopeto gather the fruits of our labors in the form of many souls broughtinto the fold.In the southern part of the State the Josephites, in Ograngecounty, haveing invited us to speak in their meeting-house, desiredthat I should ^speak^ on the "Sucsession of the Presidency", at the closethe District President arose and said that he wanted all his localauthorities to give us therir meeting-houses in which to preach and come out in force to hear us; that they wanted all the light therewas to be had on the matter. A most cordial invitation was extendedto us to preach in their meeting-house at any time:. 
 Southern part of the mission. The Fresno Republican, has published three pieces for the Reverand Mr. Munn, against us, and two forom me,in our favor; and I have answered his last piece but do not know if they have published it as yet, if they do I will send you a copy.Our relations with the Southern Pacific Company continue to be of the most pleasant nature; their officers and Agents have treated us all with the utmost kindness and courtesy and I have this morning received from Mr. J. C. Stubsbs an annuel Pass for the presant year good on all their reoads in this state and Oregon. They have reardily issued a Pass for my wife and child when ever I have desired it; and in one case where I appealred to them in a case of extfream poverty they gave me half ^fare^ of their $30 rate, cfor a widdowand five children from this city to Ogden.The questiomn of Tracts still continues to be our great drawback. We are now entirely out,and as a consequence th Elders are largly curtailed ifn their labors. With the force of Elders we now have we need at least 5000 a month which would be less than xx00 100 per month for each Elder. When the elders are canvassing from house ^to house^ they must have Tracts or their labors seem to be almost in vain.Open air meetings cannot now be sucsessfully held on account of the weather so our presant mode of prosecuting our labors is visit-ing investigators and canvassing from house to house, and we fully expect that during the winter, byn this means we shall have the pleasure of leading quite a number down ointo the water.During the last month I have visited the Elders in Fresno, Visalia, Santa Paula and Los Angeles aned as the season rolls on I intend to visit all the Elders in the mission in their several fields of labor and do all that I can to brace them up and aid and encourage them in their labors.A glorious future looms up before us. Opportunities are opening up on every hand. A good class of people are coming intothe Church; and investigators are coming into the church becoming momore plentifull every day.We know not whether we have risen to the standard requir-ed, or accomplished the amount of work expected of us; but we feel grgreatly encouraged by the brightening prospects before us. We take delight in our labors, and we enter the new year with unbounded con-fidence in the Lord that he will enable us to reap a rich harvest of souls and bgather them into the fold as the year ninty eightrolsrolls arround.We will receive with particular pleasure any instructions that you may see fit to give in relation to our conduct and the course you wish us to persue in directing the labors of the Elders during the coming years.The prayers of the Elders assend to the Almighty contin-ually in behalf of our Grand old President, Brother Woodruff;Your Brother in the GospelE. H. Nye 
 of that peculiar document a copy of which you sent me. I think that I succeeded in showing him the ordaer of the Priesthood and that the Lorld would appear to the communicate with his servant who stands at the head of the Church directly, when he had occasion to do so, and not with a lay member. I pointed toout to ^him^ the stamp of the cloven foot all over his communication and I think that he is satisfied. He said he was very glad that I had come and given him the necessary in-struction.I deeply regret dear Brother, the fact, that you have been troubl-ed so much by people writing to you on these matters from this mis-sion. We have a Sister in San Diego who seems to want something that we are unable to give her; she has written you twice for more light. I think we must be very close to the infernal regions out here as many people declare to us that they get revelations and visitations from the unseen at willL; nevertheless occasionally we find some good honest souls who gladly listen to the truth.The Elders at presant are all well and enjoying their labors and the Sister missionaries so far as has developed are prov-ing a great help in the work.Please send me such suggestions or instructions as may seem good to you and I will carry them out to the best of my ability.And now Dear Brother; with a prayer for your welfare and continued happiness and the prosperity of Zion, I remain,Your Brother in the Gospel, E. H. NyeExcellent letter.A good kind answer by Prest. Woodruff or the Presidency would be a comfort to bro. Nye. I know, nothing especially to answer. J. F. S. 
 All through the country districts a free good wiill pre-vails-with but feww exceptions. The people are willing to come outtto our meetings and listen to the doctrines we teach and it seemasto be only a question of time before many good people will come itnto the Church.I believe it would be a good plan to take a large Tent inwhich to hold meetings and go through these country settlements, stay a week or two at a time place. Take two or trhree Elders and their wives who weare good singers, the singing is a great attractinand would secure good audiences in every country district, this woudgive us an opertunity to rweach the people,and the preseance and in-fluence of the Sisters would I believe ^have^ a most benificial effect wihthe people. pPlease siginify your approval, or other-wise, of such a measure.Out-door Preaching is now being prosecuted with vigor in all thetowns and cities of the counties in wihich the Elders are laboring;and it proves to be the most effectual way of reaching the people;all the Elders are delighted with it and declare it to be the amongthe most pleasant experiences of their missionary life, and the besttraining that an elder can have.Though I am stationed hewith head-quarters here in San Francisco yet the courtesies extended tio me by the S/P.  Company enable metto visvit the Elders in their several fields of labor and thus en-courage and assist them in the actual work of preaching the gospel.The financial assistance you so kindly sent us was I as-sure you was gratef^u^lly received and the 'Baby' (Mission) thus as-sisted tlo its feet, will, Ife I feel safe in asserting, soon be ableto stand alone-financially.And now Dear Brother, trusting that the waty we are prose-cuting our labors in this mission will receive the stamop of yourapproval and that you will signify your wishes in regard to uourfuture course should you desire any changes there-in, and with a prayer to the aAlmighty for his deivine favors to rest continually uponyou and your fellow laborers in the work of the Lord,I remain Obediently yours,E. H. NyeP.S. Please note the change in our address, 508 Fulton St.If the Expense of providing and using atent can be met it would no doubt bea good thing, & if thought best by the bretheren in the mission it will be approved here.

 915 Golden Gate Ave. San Francisco, Cala.Feb. 28th, 1898.pPresaidient Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother;One of our investigators, a lady has applied for baptism;but has confessed that she had an abortion commited upon herself when she was foive or six months along in pregnancy. She was and is, living with her husband at the time, and had two sons; a rupture with her husband that seemed as though it would result in seperatino^n^caused her to do as she did. She now feels keenly the enormity of the sin she commited. What is our diuty? aAre we at liberty to bap-tize her? May she come  into the fold? Her husband though not an ininvestigator, is not opposed and would be willing that the wife shouldbe baptized. As the element of doubt enters into my soul, as tho the right course to persue in the matter, I humble seek for instructiosnPraying for special blessings upon you in your high call-ing, I remain, your Brother in the Lord;E.

 -:CALIFORNIA MISSION:-508 Fulton St. San Francisco, Calif.May, 31st, 1897.President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother;Here with I send you material that I have prepared for aTract subject to your approval. The Tracts we now have in this missnsion are unsatisfactory, and if this meets your approval I should like very much to have the privelege of getting it published, as Ithink it will be suitable for our work in this mission.Our Tracts obtained from Chattanooga, cost us 60 centsper 100 ^delivered here^ and when we send them out to the Elders in small quantitiesthere is another 18 cents added for stamps per each 100 this bringsthem rather high, whereas if we could have a good supply on handwhen an Elder goes out to his field of labor he could take withhim sufficient to last his district for some time and this wouldcut off as time rolls on, quite an amount fthrat we now pay out forstamps. I understand that the Tracts cost in Chattanooga 42 centsper 100. We have an offer from a reliable firm to publish the Tract,if we give an order forr 40,000 the price to be $145.50. As this wwill bring the tTracts down to a fraction over 36 cents per 100, andby haveing a good supply on hand ^will^ enable us to send them out withthe Elders when they go to their several fields, in many cases enou-gh to last them till they return. By this means we can furnishtwice the amount of reading matter for what our Tracts now cost us.And thus scatter the writen word more freely. The 40,000 Tractswill not be more than enough for six or eight months supply, at therate we need to use them and arfter that a better price can be obtai-ned as the price above includes the stereotype.Should you approve of the Tract, and of the matter ofgetting them published here, please return me the coppy. If in your judgement you think it can be improved by adding to, in any partic-ular part, or by cutting out any thing that is objectionable, pleasesignify your wishes in the matter. I designed to have the articlesof faith added, and if you could send me a plate of the Temple toplace the picture of that noble edifice on the outer leaf I think iit would lend an added interest to the Tract.The San Francisco Call, has just published tte the out-line of a semrmon that I delivered last night, They also mailed freeto our friends, mostly in Utah, about 120 coppies of the paper. I hada coppy sent toeach of the Presidency, They sent their artist totake my picture as it appears in the paper.Ever praying for the blessing of heave to rest in richabundance upon you and your associates, I remain,Very truly yours,E.

 CALIFORNIA MISSION.915 Golden Gate Ave. San Francisco, Calif.March 7th, 1898.President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother;The work of the Lord in this mission is still rolling on and the word from all parts is encouraging.Since my last report I have visited all through the Southern part of the mission and I am pleased to be able to stabtethat our affairs are in a most prosperous condition at that end.I have visited Apostle Young at Pacific Grove and by his sug-gestions and wise counsels I feel greatly strengthened for the work that lays before me.In Oakland the out look is particularly bright, so much so that we have deemed it wise to engage a Hall there and for plast month it has been filled every sunday evening withe earnest seek-ers after truth. The Elders there are well received and have all that they can do in visiting those who are investigating the doctrines we teach.We have engaged Halls in San Jose and Stockton as the work in those places seemed to justify it and prospects are bright for good work to be done there as the time rolls on.In many parts of the mission there is a lively interest taken in the work of the elders by the people and many are reading our works and coming to our meetings: ist is true that in some local-ities indifferance is manifested and the elders are not meeting with as much sucsess as could be desired, but there is no active or open opposition anywhere in the mission and the Elders are feeling splendid in the good work.As the spring and summer comes along quite a number of our Elders will be entitled to release and we could use several mormore than we now have to good advantage.Several of the Elders desire that they may be permitted to have their wives with them for the remainder of their mission, I can appoint them to labor in cities where they can have the compan-ionship of their wives and I believe that the Sisters would be a great help to their husbands in the missionary work. If this seems to you consistant, and meets with your approval; will you kindly sig-nify to us your assent in this matter. The names and addresses of the Sisters I enclose herewith.I shall be gratified indeed to receive any instructions that you may see fit to send me and will do my uttermost to carry them out.Ever praying for your wellfare and for the prosperity of Zion, I remain, Your Brother in the Lord,E.

 In the meridian of ^at the appointed^ time the Savior came and dwelt among the chil-dren of men. Having been born in the stable, and cradled in the mangerthe days and years of His childhood and youth were spent with His par-ents in the ordinary walks and avocations of life. Though there weresome wonderful things occured in relation to His immaculate conceptionand birth: Angelic choirs from the upper deep descended chanting gladtidings of great joy, peace on earth, good will to man; Herod's cunningplans were baffled; his boundless rage, his cruel edict, the death ofthe innocents; Joseph's heavenly warning to flee to Egypt with the youngChild; his journey and return, his stay in Gallilee that the Scripturesmight be fulfilled "He shall be called a Nazerene" [##Matthew 2:23##]   all these droppedout of the public mind, and as the years rolled by were forgotten andlost except by His relatives and friends. As He sojourned among menduring the years of His youth and early manhood there was nothing inHis life to attract the attention of His fellows until He unostentatious-ly walked down into the waters of the river Jordan and there was bap-tized by John, and though the Holy Ghost descending from the upper deepwas seen, as Jesus walked out of the water, to rest upon Him in the formof a dove, and a voice from heaven was heard to say "This is my belovedSon in whom I am well pleased" yet men did not in Him recognize the Sonof God. [##Matthew 3:17##] Though He preached the Gospel of Repentance and Baptism for theremission of sins, chose and ordained twelve Apostles and sent themforth to preach, and went forth healing all manner of sickness and diredisease Himself causing. the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the lame towalk and leap for joy, teaching as no other man had taught, healing as no other man had healed, rebuking as no other had ever dared rebuke menfor the sins they daily committed, they rejected Him and condemned Himto a cruel death, and though He rose again (which fact was noised abroadso that all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were cognizant of it) yet theycould not see in Him the Savior of the world.On the great day of Pentecost when there were gathered together de-vout men of all the surrounding nations, "suddenly there came a soundfrom heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, and it filled all the housewhere they were sitting, and there appeared unto them cloven tongueslike as of fire, and it sat upon each of them (the Apostles) and theywere all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tonguesas the Spirit gave them utterance" and the people of the multitude wereall amazed for they hqrd heard the wonderful works of God each in hisown tongue. [##Acts 2:2-4##] Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice andsaid unto them, "Ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, bethis known unto you, and hearken to my words." Then, repeating thewords of the Prophet Joel, he showed to them that Christ should come, and briefly sketching the history of His life, recounting His wonderfulworks and noble deeds, showing forth the fact to the people that theyhad by cruel hands put Him to death, thus crucifying the Lord of glory; that in fulfillment of the Prophet's words, God had raised Him from thedead; that on the third day He had been seen by the Apostles and manyothers with whom He had conversed, "whereof we all are witnesses" [##Acts 2:32##] There-fore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the

 Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, He hath shed forth this which yenow see and hear. Therefore let all the House of Israel know assuredlythat God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lordand Christ". Now when they heard this they were pricked in their heartsand said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles "Men and Brethrenwhat shall we do?" Not until this moment did they believe in Christ asthe Savior of the world. Though all His wonderful works had been per-formed in their midst, yet not until the story of His life, His terribledeath, His glorious resurrection, and the wonderful out-pouring of theHoly Ghost now so magnificently manifested before their eyes, did faithspring forth in their hearts, and a desire to be partakers of theheavenly gift caused them to plead with the Apostles, "Oh what shall wedo!" [##Acts 2:14-37##] This faith is the main-spring of all action, a mighty moving power.By it Noah, Abraham and Moses performed their wonderful works; the chil-dren of Israel passed through the Red Sea, the walls of Jerico fell, theHarlot Rahab perished not; Gideon, Barak, David and others of the prop-hets subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises andstopped the mouths of lions. The Apostle Paul understood the wonderfulpower of faith when he said, ##Hebrews 11:6|Heb. XI, 6th,## "But without faith it is im-possible to please Him; for he that cometh to God must believe that Heis, and that He is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him." Thisverse is self explanatory. If we did not know that God lives and willreaward those that diligently seek Him, we would not seek Him at all.The ##Hebrews 11:3|3rd verse## reads:"Through faith we understand that the worlds wereframed by the word of God." So then, not only could the wonderful worksbefore recounted be performed by the old worthies, but even worlds couldbe framed when necessary through the faith that was in God who createdthem. But will faith alone accomplish the salvation of the souls ofman? As opinions differ, and he who risks his soul's salvation upon theuncertainties of men's opinions has but a vain hope of being led aright,let the Scriptures answer the question. ##James 2:14-26|James 2nd ch. 14-26.## This de-claration of the great Apostle seems to set at rest for all time thetheory that faith alone is sufficient to save mankind. In closing hisspeech, he very forcibly states that "As the body without the spirit isdead, so faith without works is dead also." Shall we not say then, thatworks are necessary, and if so what are those works? Again let theScriptures tell the tale. ##Matthew 3:2|Math. 3, 2nd## "In those days came John theBaptist saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand."Jesus came preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, (##Mark 1:15|Mark 1, 15th.##)"And saying, the time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand;repent ye, and believe the Gospel." ##Mark 6:12|Mark 6, 12th,## "And they (the Apostles)went out, and preached that men whould repent." Jesus was evidentlydetermined that there should be no mistake upon this matter when He said,(##Luke 13:3-5|Luke 13, 3-5##) "I tell you nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all like-wise perish. Or those eighteen upon twhom the tower in Siloam fell andslew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwell atJerusalem? I tell you NAY; but except ye repent, ye shall all like-wise perish." The word of the Lord to Israel in the days of Ezekiel wasequally positive. (##Ezekiel 18:30|Ezek. 18, 30th##) "Therefore I will judge you, Oh Houseof Israel, everyone according to his ways, saith the Lord God. Repent

 and turn yourselves from all your transgressions, so iniquity shall notbe your ruin." [##Ezekiel 18:30##] Nor does it appear that conditions had at all changedin the days of the Apostle Paul for we find him declaring in the mostemphatic terms (##Acts 17:30|Acts 17, 30th##) "And the times of this ignorance Godwinked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent." This then,is the first grand step of preparatory work in securing salvation inthe Kingdom of God. But the question may arise, 'Wherein have I sinned?In what have I done wrong? I have complied with all the requirements ofthe decalogue, I have lived the golden rule, doing to others as I wouldbe done by; what have I to repent of?' Look abroad upon the face of theearth, search i)n all the Christian world for the true Chruch of Christas organized and recognized by Him, and where do you find it? Like theship-wrecked mariner whose weary eyes scan the vast horizon with a ling-ering hope that friendly salil will come to his relief, till his heartgrows faint and dies within him, so it is with many an honest-heartedone, seeking the way to eternal life, anon as he listens to the variouscreeds and examines the doctrines of the different sects, he discoversdiscrepencies everywhere. No one has a perfect form of worship, allhave dwindled in unbelief; they have departed from the faith of theancients; they have turned away from the true and living God, as the Apostle Paul said (##2 Timothy 4:3|2nd Tim. 4, 3rd##) "For the time will come when theywill not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts shall theyheap to themselves teachers having itching ears, and they shall turnaway their hearts from the truth, and shall be turned into favbles." Hav-ing a form of godliness but denying the power thereof. Preaching fordoctrine the precepts of menChurches have been erected whose cloud-piercing spires rise inevery town and city, village and hamlet over all the land, in which menpreach for hire and divine for money, thus making merchandise of thesouls of men, having, as Isaiah says "Transgressed the laws, changedthe ordinances and broken the everlasting covenant" and "it shall be aswith the people, so with the priest" [##Isaiah 24:5##] [##Isaiah 24:2##] and as Jesus said in Luke "Can theblind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?" [##Luke 6:39##] Weanswer by saying as the Apostles of old said: "REPENT AND BE BAPTISEDAND WASH AWAY YOUR SINS." Yes, for the fruits of repentance is a brokenheart and a contrite spirit; and it is provided that such a one should walk in the footsteps of Jesus, down into the water, and like Him, beburied beneath the liquid wave. This was the first act that Jesus didpreparatoryto His ministerial labors, and the very last command He gaveto His Apostles prior to His ascension up into heaven, (##Matthew 28:19-20|Mat. 28, 19-20##)"Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptising them in the name ofthe Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe allthings whatsoever I have commanded you." And what had He just commandedthem? -to baptise all nations The next witness testifies a littlestronger (##Mark 16:15-16|Mark 16, 15-16##) "And He said unto them, Go ye into all theworld and preach the Gospel to every creature, He that believeth andis baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned."Oh what an opportunity to secure eternal life, what a glorious promise, and this too from the author of our salvation! We say that we believeon Him, that we have faith in Him, and yet we persistently refuse to ac-cept the conditions that He has offered for our salvation. Surely no 
 [sideways text] E. H. NyeMar. 7 [18]98 [end of sideways text] 
 one will have the audacity to assert that He who gave His life and shedHis blood that we may obtain eternal life, has not the right to estab-lish the conditions upon which we may secure the benefits of that aton-ing blood. His promise is plain, and in language unmistakable, "He thatbelieves and is baptized shall be saved" and let us not forget thatthe declaration is equally positive that "He that believeth not shallbe damned." [##Mark 16:16##] Nor is John the Beloved less im^ex^plicit in his statement ofwhat the Savior said to Nicodemas (##John 3:5|John 3, 5th##) "Jesus answered, verilyverily I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God." Here is a declaration fromthe great Master Himself that ought to be sufficient answer to all whofondly imagine that they can find some other way. Again, there arethose who believe that if they live a life of honor and integrity amongmen, and serve God according to the best light they have, that they willbe entitled to an inheritance in the Kingdom of God. To all such letthe Scriptures once more declare the fact. (##Acts 10:1-6|Acts 10, 1-6)##and 48th) "Therewas a man in Cesarea called Cornelius, a Centurion of the band calledthe Italion Band, a devout man and one that feared God with all hishouse, which gave much alms to the people and prayed to God alway. Hesaw in a vision, evidently about the ninth hour of the day, an Angel ofGod coming in to him and saying unto him, Cornelius; and when he lookedon him he was afraid and said, What is it, Lord? and He said unto himThy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God; andnow send men to Joppa and call for one Simon whose sir name is Peter.He lodgeth with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea-side. Heshall tell thee what thou oughtest to do." Ah! Cornelius, thou God-fearing, alms-giving, prayerful man, there is something that you havenot done! Though your faith has reached unto heaven, and your prayershave been heard and your alms-giving considered by the Almighty, yetthere is something that you have not done of such great importance thatthe windows of heaven were opened and an angel sent forth unto you as a messenger, to notify you of the fact. What is it, Cornelius? He sentfor Peter as he was commanded, and when Peter came, saw their faith andheard their words and they believed on the Lord Jesus, "He command-ed them to be baptized." [##Acts 10:48##] This is the door into the Kingdom of God.Now there is a great diversity of opinion among men as to the grandobject for which Baptism was institutied; some believing that it shouldbe performed in the presence of a great number of people as a testimonyto them that the humble penitent has put on Christ; others again, claim-ing that it is an "outward sign of an inward grace", and still others,that it was intended as a witness before men of a "change of heart". Nota word can be found in the Scriptures to support any of these positions, but on the other hand, evidence abounds in the sacred Record to provethat the ordinance of baptism was for the purpose of "washing away" and"for the remission of sins". Let us take the testimony of ##Mark 1:4|Saint Mark 1,4;##"John did pbaptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentancefor the remission of sins;" of ##Luke 3:3|St. Luke 3, 3,## "And he came into all thecountry about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the re-mission of sins;" ##Acts 2:38|Acts 2, 38,## "Then Peter said unto them, Repent andbe baptised, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the re-

 mission of sins." Also ##Acts 22:16|Acts 22, 16,## "And now why tarriest thou? Ariseand be baptized and wash away thy sins." Here the grand question ariseswhat does sin consist of? Is it not the violation of law or the break-ing of a command, and is not the sin of ommission as great as the sinof commission? Surely the commandment "Remember the Sabbath day to keepit holy" is just as binding as the one that precedes it "Thou shalt nottake the name of the Lord they God in vain"; yet the failure to obey theone would be the sin of ommission, while to break the other would be thesin of commission. [##Exodus 20:7-8##] And are not the commandments issued by the Saviorand His Apostles as much the commands of God as those uttered forth fromthe coloud-capped peak of Mount Sinai? And if so, a failure to complywhen "God commands all men everywhere to repent" as in ##Acts 22:16|Acts 22, 16,## orwhere Peter commanded them to "repent and be baptized for the remissionof sins" as in ##Acts 2:38|Acts 2, 38,## brings us under the condemnation of a brokenlaw and adjudges us all as sinners before God.Having now discovered the door of the straight and narrow way thatleads to eternal life, which is baptism, and the object of that baptismthat it is for the purpose of remitting or washing away our sins, itnow becomes particularly interesting to decide who are proper candidatesfor baptism. Among the various sects and creeds of modern christendommany believe in the practise of baptizing little children. We unhesi-tateingly say without fear of successful contradiction, that no foundatioor justification of such a practice can be found in the Scriptures.It has been shown beyong question according to the Scriptures, thatbaptism is for the remission of sins. Sin is the breaking of laws orcommands of God. The child, until it comes to the years of understand-ing, is not able to comprehend law or understand the binding nature ofa command to obey or disobey; hence it is irresponsible. For wherethere is no comprehension there is no law; and where there is no lawthere can be no sin; and where there is no sin, baptism is uncalled forand out of place and is the direct violation of the commands of our Sav-ior. For if by baptism one child who dies in its infancy may be usheredinto the arms of Jesus, and for the lack of baptism another child dyingin its infancy is forbidden His sacred presence, then are we not bereak-ing His direct command where He said, as in ##Mark 10:13-15|St. Mark 10, 13-15## "And theybrought young children to Him that He sholuld touch them, and His discip-les rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it He was much displeased, andsaid unto them 'Suffer little children to come unto mMe and forbid themnot, for of such is the Kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whoso-ever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon them and blessed them." The testimony of St. Luke is almost identical.It reads as follows (##Luke 18:15-17|Luke 18, 15-17##) "And they brought unto Him also,infants that He should touch them, but when His disciples saw it theyrebuked them. But Jesus called them unto Him, and said, Suffer littlechildren to come unto Me, and forbid them not for of such is the King-dom of God. Verily I say u)nto you, whosoever shall not receive the King-dom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein." Clearlythen, baptism was never intended for little children, for baptism hav-ing been instituted for the purpose of washing away sins, sins alreadycommitted, and the child not having committed any, the ordinance would 
 not apply. But what is more important than all, he that believes inand declares it necessary for the little child to be baptized, and bap-tizes it, is committing a most grievous sin in the sight of God. For ifit were true, as claimed by many Christians, that the little infant thatdies without baptism is shut out from the presence of God, that hell ispaved with little unbaptized children, they are erecting a barrier tothose little infants in the form of the ordinance of baptism and "for-bidding" all such to come unto Christ, thus breaking one of His most em-phatic commands uttered when "He was much displeased" at what they weredoing and said, "Forbid them not, but suffer them to come unto Me." [##Mark 10:14##] Thelittle child is pure and innocent because it can commit no sin till itcomes to the years of accountability. Sin then conceives in its heart, and as it grows in years Satan tempts it and it becomes sinful and wick-ed, and the means provided by the Almighty to cleanse it and make itagain as pure and as innocent as it was in the beginning of its mortalcareer, is the sacred ordinance of baptism. And thus may the repentantsinner become like the example that Jesus set before them as shown by##Matthew 18:2-4|Mat. 18, 2-4##; "And Jesus called a little child unto Him and set him inthe midst of them and said, Verily I say unto you, except you be con-verted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the king-dom of heaven. Whosoever, therefore, shall humble himself as this littlechild, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven." Thus the littlechild is given to us as a pattern of purity, a sample of innocence, bythe Savior Himself; and the bare theory of baptizing such little inno-cents to wash away their sins, becomes revolting to the human mind whenconsidered under the light of reason, as the practice of it is an abom-ination in the sight of God. So little children are not elegible tobaptism. This declaration stands out in bold relief when viewed in thelight of the following passages which plainly prove that all candidatesfor the kingdom of God must be capable of being taught. (##Matthew 28:19-20|Nat. 28, 19-20##)"Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name ofthe Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to ob-serve all things whatsoever I have commanded you." All must have suf-ficient mental development to be capable of believing the doctrinestaught, as shown by the Savior's commandments, and ##Mark 16:16|Mark 16, 16##, "He thatbelieveth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth notshall be damned." "But when they believed Phillip preaching the thingsconcerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they werebaptized, both men and women." (##Acts 8:12|Acts 8, 12##) "And as they went on theirway they came unto a certain water, and the Eunuch said, See here iswater; what does hinder me to be baptized? and Phillip said, If thoutruly believest with all thine heart though mayest, and he answered andsaid, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." (##Acts 8:36-37|Acts 8, 36-7##)A knowledge of the divine truths of revealed religion when onceimpressed upon the heart, causes faith to spring forth in the soul, andwe reflect with admiration upon the life of Him whose wondrous love wasmanifested towards us when He offered His life as a sacrifice for oursins. And by comparison we realize our own unworthiness, that our feethave strayed from the path of right and that we are steeped in iniquity.With this conviction comes a resolution to turn, if possible, from our 
 wicked ways and walk in newness of life. This brings repentance, a for-saking of sin, a reverence for Almighty God and an earnest desire tosearch after and serve Him in spirit and in truth. We resolve to treadthe path our Savior walked, down into the waters of baptism, thus following Him down through the door into the Kingdom of God, that where He iswe may be also. Sufficient mental capacity to be taught, to believe,to repent and to voluntarily offer ones self for obedience to the suc-ceeding principle of the Gospel are prerequisites to the ordinance ofbaptism. Little children cannot do these things, consequently there isno law of God requiring them to be baptised; and all man-made systemsto the contrary will be null and void in the day of judgment.MODE OF BAPTISM.As there are so ma^n^y conflicting opinions on this question; theorthodox Christian churches having departed from the faith of theApostles, and built up churches to themselves for the purpose of makingmerchandise of the souls of men, have instituted the practice of sprin-kling and pouring &c. and call it baptism, to support which not oneword can be found in holy Writ. The whole sense of the ordinance ofbaptism from the time that John the Baptist came preaching the baptismof repentance for the remission of sins, on through all the writings ofthe New Testament conclusively proves the fact that baptism by immers-ion was the mode taught and practiced by Jesus and His Apostles. [##Matthew 3:1-2##] Jesus, when He was baptized, "Went up straightway out of the water." [##Matthew 3:16##] WhenPhillip baptized the Eunuch "They went down both into the water, bothPhillip and the Eunuch, and he baptized him, and when they were come upout of the water, &c" [##Acts 8:38-39##] All this clearly indicates immersion, or why godown into or come up out of the water? Paul says to the ##Romans 6:4|Romans 4, 4##;"Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death" ##Romans 6:5|5th##, "For ifwe have been planted together in the likeness of His death." Certainlythere is nothing in a sprinkling or a pouring that represents either a burial or a planting, but each of these passages point in Unmistakableterms to a baptism by immersion. The Apostle Paul again makes this clearin his Episitle to the ##Colossians 2:12|Collosians 2, 12##; "Buried with Him in baptismwherein also ye are risen with Him." When John baptized in the wilder-ness "There went out unto him all the land of Judea and they of Jeru-salem, and were all baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessingtheir sins." (##Mark 1:5|Mark 1, 5##)All the evidence contained in the sacred Scriptures points unmis-takably to the fact that immersion was the only mode of baptism practic-ed by the Apostles and early Christians. Profane history gives con-clusive evidence of this fact. Speaking of baptism in the first cen-tury Dr. Mosheim says "In this century baptism was administered in con-venient places without the public assemblies, and by immersing the can-didate wholly in water." (Mosheim's Church History (Murdock) ThirdEdition, Vol. 1, p. 87) Of the second century, the same great authorsays: "Twice a year, namely at Easter and Whitsuntine, baptism wasadministered by the Bishop or by the presbyters acting by his commandand authority. The candidates for it were immersed wholly in water withthe invocation of the sacred Trinity, according to the Savior's precept."Indeed, the first deviation from baptizing by immersion occurs ina case recorded by Eusebius, as happening in the third century. He alludes 
 to it in these detracting terms: "He (Novatian) fell into a griev-ous distemper, and it beigng supposed that he would die immediately hereceived baptism (being sprinkled with water) on the bed where he lay,(if that can be termed baptism) neither when he had escaped that sick-ness, did he afterwards receive the other things which the canon of theChurch enjoined should be received." (Ecclesiastical History, (Eusebius)p. 113) Even down to the close of the thirteenth century baptism byimmersion was the rule, and sprinkling and pouring the exception. Yetthe innovation thus made in the third century has worked its insiduousway in the various divisions of Christianity until to-day a convert canhave any kind of baptism he may desire; thus have they departed fromthe faith of the Apostles and are teaching for religion the commandmentsof men, having "Transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, brokenthe everlasting covenant," in fulfillment of the words of the ProphetIsaiah. (Isaiah 24, 5)GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST.The next step in the regular order of initiation into the fold ofChrist is to secure the birth of the Spirit, or the baptism of the HolyGhost; this being essential to enable us to pursue an acceptable coursein the service of the Lord, that the Holy Ghost may be with us as anabiding gift, as a light ^lamp^ to our feet and a light to our pathway throughlife. The Lord in His wonderful plan for the salvation of the souls ofmen has provided a way for the humble and penitent baptized believer tosecure this blessed gift. (Mark 1, 8) "I indeed have baptized you withwater, but He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost." (Acts 1, 5) "ForJohn truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the HolyGhost not many days hence." Behold the promise fulfilled. (Acts 2, 2-4)"And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty windand it filled all the house where they were sitting, and there appearedunto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.And then^y^ were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak withother tongues as the spirit gave them utterance." But this preciousgift was not to be given until after Jesus was glorified, as shown bythe following, (John 7, 39) " for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, be-cause that Jesus was not yet glorified."On that great Penticostal day the Holy Ghost was given and a glor-ious manifestation of heavenly light appeared sitting upon each of theApostles who had accompanied the Savior in all His travels and had wit-nessed His wonderful works, and by His divine favor had been made par-takers of His holy ministry. They now received the promised blessingin rich abundance, and a way was provided by which they might transmitit to others who would comply with the special requirements, as shownby the following: (Acts 8, 17) "Then laid they their hands on them andthey received the Holy Ghost." Evidently the Holy Ghost came not as theresult of the baptism nor in answer to ^the^ prayer of the Apostles, but bythe laying on of their hands. Clearly showing that this was the mode theLord had provided by which the Holy Ghost should be conferred upon bap-tized believers; this again is clearly set forth in Acts 19, 5-6 "When 
 they heard this they were baptized in thename of the Lord Jesus. Andwhen Paul had laid his hands on them the Holy Ghost came on them, andthey spake with tongues and prophesied.The Blood of Christ.We have now pointed out to the penitent believer the path thatleads to eternal life, the straight and narrow way, and carefull notedthe inscriptions along the line, down into the water through the doorinto the kingdom of God. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance ofall sins, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, gift of theHoly Ghost by the laying on of hands; this is the course marked out bythe Father to prepare His children to receive the benefits of the aton-ing blood of Jesus Christ. Earthly things are typical of heavenlythings as set forth in the following (1 John 5, 7-8) "For there arethree that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the HolyGhost, and these three are one; and there are three that bear witnessin the earth, the Spirit, the water and the blood, and these three agreein one." By the water we keep the commandment, by the spirit are wejustified and by the blood are we sanctified; and thus we become Saints.He who has fully repented of his sins and been baptized for the remiss-ion thereof, and received the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, maythen partake of the emblems of the Savior's flesh and blood; and inthat sacred ordinance eat and drink to His soul the benefits of thatatoning blood. And such have the promise of the Savior that they shallnever hunger or thirst. There is no other way provided on earth bywhich mankind can secure the benefits of the aton)ing blood of Christ.AUTHORITY.Upon this question hinges the validity of all the acts of men.Every officer of our Government must be elected or appointed accordingto the mode established by the constitution of the United States, or his official acts fall to the ground as null and void. The decisionsof the court involving the validity of titles to land or other great inter-ests would be void if it could be shown that the judge rendering thedecision had not been elected or appointed legally. Every deed issuedby a Sheriff at a sherriff's sale of real estate would be void if itcould be shown that the sheriff was a usurper and not legally authorizedto officiate in the duties of the office. All naturalization papersissued by a judge when it could be shown that he had never been electedor appointed according to constitutional requirements, would by a legaltribunal be declared worthless and the holder deprived of his citizen-ship. In fact the question of authority to act in any of the affairs ofhuman life is so clearly understood by all persons of ordinary intell-igence that time would seem to be wasted in discussing it; but not soin questions involving the future of the human soul. In these sacredand vastly more important matters upon which hang all our hopes ofeternal life, the average man seems willing to trust to the opinions ofa minister of some of the orthodox sects or to the wild vagaries of anyupstart who cries "Lo here is Christ," or "Lo he is there" without fora single moment raising the question Where is his authority to offic- 
 iate in the sacred ordinances of the Gospel of Christ? or to initiatemen into the kingdom of God? The average merchant in conducting hisregular business, when waited upon by one claiming to be an agent of amanufacturer, places his order with that agent fully expecting to re-ceive the goods. As the time rolls on the goods come according. to thesample shown and the order given. This fact alone is proof to the mer-chant that the agent was in touch with his principal and was a dulyauthorized agent. But if the good^s^ come not, it is strogng presumptiveevidence that the agent was a fraud and was not authorized by the manu-facturer to take orders for goods. If this test be applied to theministers of the various sects of the Christian world it will at oncebe found that they are self-appointed agents, not in touch with theprincipal whom they claim to represent, as their patrons receive notthe goods. In other words the signs and wonders promised by the Saviorare lacking and do not follow the believer, which alone is sufficientevidence that the so-called ministers are never sent of God. Jesus said"Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature, hethat believeth and is baptized shall be saeved, but he that believethnot shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe;in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing itshall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall re-cover." These signs though forming one of the most prominent featuresof the Gospel in the days of the Apostles are not to be found in any ofthe contending sects of modern Christendom. Such as hunger and thirstafter righteousness become members of the various churches and humblybow at their sanctuaries, believing the doctrines there taught. Hunger-ily they seek food for their souls; thirstily they come, like sheep, to the fountain, only to fingd that the storehouse is empty, the fountainis dry. The promised blessigsngs fail, the signs do not follow, they re-ceive not the goods. The grand secret of it all is, God has not sentthe agents through whom they seek these blessings; they hold no author-ity to officiate in the ordinances of His house. As agents they arenot in touch with their Principal. These ministers are self-appointedteachers of man-made systems of religion, they are teaching for doctrinethe commandments of men.From the time the Christian Fathers fell by persecution, death orcontroversy, from their original faith down to the time of the EmperiorConstantine made the catholic faith universal through the Roman pro-vinces in the ^year^ 323 A D, the forms of the Christian religion were con-statntly undergoing a change. At that time there were incorporated inthe Christian Church, heathen rites, which with the innovation addeddown through the ages to the present time, stamps that church to-dayas one entirely separate and apart from the original apostolic Church.Without Apostles and Prophets through whom they might obtain the wordof God, the Church has steadily drifted from its moorings unto ^onto^ thebroad sea of men's opinions till it is split and divided into hundredsof different sects and creeds, no one of which can present an organ-ization to-day that even resembles the form of the Church of Christ. The 
 most important features have been eliminated. Signs and wonders andmiraculous gifts, together with the fruits of the Spirit, set forth bythe Apostle Paul in ##1 Corinthians 12|first Cor. 12th## have disappeared, and but the emptypowerless form is found to-day among the children of men. The shadowalone remains; the substance has departed. And why? Because mankindhave departed from the faith of the ancients. The rights, powers andprivileges of the Apostolic Priesthood have long since been withdrawnfrom man, and all who officiate in religious rites do so without auth-ority from the living God.If we examine and see how the servants of God were called to theministry in other ages we can discover a guide to direct us in obtain-ing authority in this age. Moses was called from out the burning bushby God Himself (##Exodus 3|Ex. 3##) and when he was about to be succeeded by Joshuaas leader, Hhe conferred upon Joshua the holy priesthood by the layingon of his hands. (See ##Deuteronomy 34:9|Deut. 34, 9##) "And Joshua, the son of Nun was fullof the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his hands upon him." Jesuswhen He entered upon His ministry, called twelve and ordained them, viz;"And He ordained twelve that they should be with Him and that He mightsend them forth to preach." (##Mark 3:14|Mark 3, 14##) Again He says "Ye have ^not^ chosenMe but I have chosen you and ordained you." (##John 15:16|John 15, 16##). Jesus saidin His prayer unto His Father, "As Thou hast sent Me into the world evenso have I also sent them into the world." (##John 17:18|John 17, 18##). The ApostlePaul evidently had this question of authority to meet, as he gave ventto his feelings in the following forcible language, "Whereunto I am or-dained a preacher and an Apostle (I speak the truth in Christ and lienot), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity." (##1 Timothy 2:7|I Tim. 2, 7##). Itwas very gratifying no doubt to the Apostle Paul to be able to declarewith such emphasis the fact of his ordination, and no wonder when weconsider the way in which he was called. He was justly entitled to de-clare it, as will be seen by the manner of his calling. "As they minis-tered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Ghost said: Separate me Barnabusand Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they hadfasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away, sothey being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, &c" (##Acts 13:2-4|Acts 13, 2-4##) Paul thenwas evidently called by direct revelation of the Holy Ghost, and whenthe hands of the Prophets were laid upon him, he was sent away, as alsowas his companion Barnabus.The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews makes a most positive de-claration on this question. He says: "For every High Priest taken fromamong men is ordained for men, in things pertaining to God that he mayoffer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; And no man taketh thishonor to himself, but he that is called of God as was Aaron." (##Hebrews 5:1-4|Heb. 5,4##) 
 A glance at ##Exodus 4:14-16|Exodus 4, 14-16 and 27-28## will show us how Aaron was called:"And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and Hs said, Is nnot Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well, andalso behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and when he seeth thee he willbe glad in his heart. And thou shalt speak unto him and put words inhis mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and willteach you what ye shall do; and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people"Thus Aaron was called of God; and in all ages when God has had a peopleon the earth, His servants have been duly called of Him and ordained,and the stamp of His approval has been placed on their labors in signsand wonders and miraculous manifestations.LACK OF AUTHORITY.Not only are the Scriptures teeming with evidence that the servantsof God were duly authorized, call ed and ordained, to officiate in theordinances of His house in all ages of which the Bible gives us any ac-count, but the fact stands out in bold relief, that in every instancewhere men dared to act without authority the Lord manifested His dis-pleasure in a just rebuke for their presumption; as in the case ofKing Saul recorded in ##1 Samuel 13:8-14|I Sam, 13, 8-13##: "And he tarried seven days ac-cording to the set time that Samuel had appointed, but Samuel came notto Gilgal and the people were scattered from him. And Saul said, Bringhither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings. And he offered theburnt offering. And it came to pass that as soon as he had made an endof offering the burnt offering, behold Samuel came; and Saul went outto meet him. And Samuel said What hast thou done? and Saul said Be-cause I sawst that the people were scattered from me and that thoucamest not within the days appointed, and that the Phillistines gatheredthemselves together at Michmash; therefore said I: The Phillistines willcome down now upon me to Gilgal and I have not made supplication untothe Lord; I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering. AndSamuel said to Saul: Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept thecommandment of the Lord thy God which He commanded thee; for now wouldthe Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever, but now thykingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought Him a man after Hisown heart and the Lord hath commanded him to be Captain over His peoplebecause thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee." And thushe lost his kingdom and his life through daring to officiate in thepriest's office without authority. Nor did Uzziah, king of Judah re-ceive any better recognition, for though he had gained the favor ofheaven in his earlier days through obedience to the commands of God,yet in after years when proud and haughty and flushed with victory, heessayed to officiate in the Priest's office, as shown in the following:"But when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction, forhe transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple ofthe Lord to burn incense upon the alter of incense. And Azariah, thepriest went in after him and with him four score priests of the Lord thatwere valiant men. And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said untohim: It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, 
 but to the priests, the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn in-cense. Go out of the sanctuary for though hast trespassed; neither shallit be for thine honor from the Lord God. Then Uzziah was wroth and hada censor in his hand to burn incense. And while he was wroth with thepriests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests inthe house of the Lord, from beside the incense altar. And Azariah thechief priest and all the priests looked upon him, and behold he wasleprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence, yea, him-self hasted also to go out because the Lord had smitten him. And Uzziahthe King was a leper unto the day of his death." [##2 Chronicles 26:16-21##] Such a terriblepenalty, it would seem, should have been a warning to all succeedinggenerations to refrain from interfering with sacred things withoutauthority. But another single instance is recorded before God gave themup to a reprobate mind, and this was during the days of the Apostles, andis contained in the following quotation: "Then certain of the vagabondJews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spiritsthe name of the Lord Jesus, saying; We abjure you by Jesus whom Paulpreacheth. And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew and chief ofthe priests, who did so. And the evil spirit answered and said; JesusI know and Paul I know, but who are ye? And the man in whom the evilspirit was, leaped on them and prevailed against them, so that they fledout of that house, naked and wounded. And this was known to all theJews and Greeks also, dwelling at Ephesus, andfear fell on them all,and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified." [##Acts 19:13-17##]It would seem that the Christian world have learned a lesson fromthe reading of the foregoing passages, as they no longer attempt tocast out devils or heal the sick by the laying on of hands in the nameof Jesus, knowing only too well that they have no authority to do so,and fearing the consequences as dire to themselves, either by receivingsuch punishment as was meted out to the sons of Sceva or by thus reveal-ing the fact that they were unauthorized of God, expose themselves tothe just resentment of their deceived and misguided followers.SALVATION FOR THE DEAD.In this age of religious freedom when every man is at liberty toworship how, where or what he pleases, when the Christian Church issplit and divided into innumerable sects and creedsand is still divid-ing and subdividing; where the opinions of men, crystalized into creeds,pass current as systems of theological truths; while spiritualism in allits various forms is rampant upon the earth, and its younger and moredelicately molded brother, theosophy, is just bursting forth as awonderful revelation from the unseen world, while darkness covers theeatrth and gross darkness the people, and the men are continually seek-ing for that which borders upon the sensational, the word of God comesforth proclaiming the principles of salvation for the dead as well as for the living. That there is but one faith, one hope, one baptism, oneway to obtain eternal life, either for the living or for the dead, isclearly shown by the Scriptures. "To the law and to the testimony; ifthey speak not according to this word it is because there is no lightin them." (##Isaiah 8|Isaiah 8##, ##Isaiah 20|20##). This shall be our guide, by this divine 
 method we are willing that all might be judged. Opinuions of men arenot the words of God, nor is the word of God to receive a private inter-pretation as is clearly shown by the following: "Knowing this firstthat no prophecy of the Scriptures is of any private interpretation.For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy menof God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." [##2 Peter 1:20-21##] Opinions of menshall not then prevail, but we will take the word of God for our gGuide,"And when they shall say unto you, seek unto them that have familiarspirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter, should not a peopleseek unto their God for the living to the dead?" (##Isaiah 8:19|Isa. 8, 19##) Let usto the Scriptures then, and seek the word of God for a knowledge of the dead.After Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, fulfilled His missionamong the living and was about to depart to the unseen world and per-form his work for the salvation of the dead; while he was suffering thepangs of death upon the cross between two malefactors, he was railedupon by one, yet worshiped by the other, to whom He said: "To-day shaltthou be with Me in Paradise. [##Luke 23:43##] This saying has created a belief in theChristian world that the vilest sinner on his death-bed or the murdererupon the gallows by confessing Christ at the alast moment can be saved.But let us find out what became of the thief. Where did he go? Toheaven? Not if the Scriptures are true. On the morning of the Savior'sresurrection and Mary's visit to the sepulcher, she thought Jesus to bethe gardener. Yet when He said "Mary" she at once recognized Him and in her joy evidently sought to embrace Him, for it is said, "Jesus saithunto her: touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but goto my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and yourFather and to my God and your God." (##John 20:17|John 20, 17##) If this be true, aarewe not justified in asking the question, "Lord, if thou hast not beento they Father and God during those three days, where has though been,and where didst thou take that thief?" Let the Scriptures answer. Men's opinions are worthless on such vital questions. "For Christ also hathonce suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring usto God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spiritby which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison, whichsometime were disobedient when once the long suffering of Noah Godwaited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing, wherein few,that is, eight souls were saved by water." (##1 Peter 3:18-20|I Peter 3, 18-20##) So thenChrist took the thief to the spirit world and there undoubtedlypreached the Gospel to him in connection with Noah's people. And why?"For for this cause was the Gospel preached to them that are dead, thatthey might be judged according to men in the flesh but live accordingto God in the Spirit." [##1 Peter 4:6##] It would seem that this can need no explanationfor by this rule all men are to be judged by the same law, whether theyhear the Gospel in life or after death. And herein is the justice ofAlmighty God made manifest, for if it were not so, and if the modernChristianity theory should prevail, viz. that all mankind who do notconfess Christ are lost what shall be said of four-fifths of thepeople on the earth to-day, and those that have lived in like circum-stances in the heathen world, who never heard of Christ? If, when allmankind are brought before the judgment-seat to be judged, and theheathen hears his sentence read by the 
 great Judge, "Depart from Me, ye cursed, into the place prepared forthe devil and his angels, because you never confessed My name." [##Matthew 25:41##] Wouldnot that heathen be justified in saying, "Who are thou? I never heardof Jesus Christ. When I was on the earth I worshipped Joss and servedhim faithfully." To punish the heathen for not confessing Christ whenin fact he had never heard of him, is contrary to the justice of an all-wise Creator. But God has provided a better way. All who have neverheard the Gospel in life will have an opportunity after death, asclearly set forth in the above as in the following: "Verily, verily Isay unto you, the hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hearthe voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live." [##John 5:25##]"But,"says the objector, "that means all they that are dead in sin," but reada little farther: "Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in thewhich all that are in the graves shall hear His voice." (##John 5:28|John 5, 25 and28##) Again, "For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale'sbelly, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth." (##Matthew 12:40|Mat. 12, 40##). By these passages it is clearlyapparent that the Savior fore-knew His mission to the spirit world inthe heart of the earth, and that while there, all who were in theirgraves would hear His voice. Not only was this understood by Jesus andHis Apostles, but long prior to the Savior's day, the Prophets foresawthe work He would do for the dead, viz: "I the Lord have called theein righteousness, and will hold thine hand and will keep thee, and givethee for a covenant toof the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to openthe blind eyes, to bring out the 7 prisoners from the prison, and themthat sit in darkness out of the prison house." (##Isaiah:42:6-7|Isaiah 42, 6-7##). Herethe prophet foretold the labors of the Savior. During His sojourn inthe flesh, we have no account of His having brought out the prisonersfrom the prison, or proclaiming liberty to the captives, or the opening of the prison to them that are bound. Had hHe done so, the Roman Gov-ernment would have had a case against Him, yet Pilate found no fault inHim. Hence we must look elsewhere for the fulfillment of these pass-ages. "And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall punishthe host of the high ones that are on high and the kings of the earthupon the earth, and they shall be gathered together as prisoners aregathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison and after manydays shall they be visited." (##Isaiah 26:21-22|Isaiah 26, 21-2##). Here is the final of aterrible picture of the earth's desolation, when it is to be empty,turned up-side-down, broken, dissolved, removed like a cottage, and theinhabitants thereof scattered. All are to be gathered, including thekings and the high ones, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, shut upin prison and after many days visited. What will be the object of thisvisitation? Peter has already told it, as Christ visited the antide-luvians, so when these have suffered the vengeance of almighty God inthe spirit ^world,^ some of His servants, ministering angels, will be sent tovisit them and preach the Gospel to them as Jesus did. "lift ^up^ yourheads, Oh ye gates, and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and theKing of glory shall come in. Who is this king of glory? The Lord strong 
 and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle." (Psalm 24, 7-8). What wasthe subject of the vision thus portrayed by the prophet and where wasit to take place? He saw the Savior making His triumpjhial entry intothe infernal regions, and with irresistable power the gates and doorsare made to fly open, and the immortal King stands in the midst of theprisoners of the spirit world. Thus the full import of that beautifulpassage of the psalmist David would read: List up your heads, oh yegates of hell, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors of the prisonsof the damned, and the King of glory shall come in, to the regions ofdarkness proclaiming liberty to the captives and the opening of theprison doors to them that are bound in hell. If the antideluvians aftertheir long sojourn in the regions of darkness were had in remembrancebefore God so that He sent His beloved Son to preach to them the Gospelduring the time His body lay in the tomb, what shall be done for thosewho have died since the Savior's visit to the spirit world? As HisApostles and all His faithful followers served Him in life, who shallsaty that after death they will not follow His example, and continue toserve Him by going to the spirit world and there preaching to thespirits in prison who have died without a knowledge of the Gospel? Andwhen these poor benighted beings after their long captivity under thereign of Lucifer, listen to the precious truths of the Gospel of Christand become converted, straightway the question arises, How can I obeythe ordinances of baptism? I am in a disembodied state of existence,yet my Savior has said: "Except ye are born of the water and of thespirit ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of God." Oh wonderful planprovided by the Almighty! The living may be baptized for the dead. Itis very plain that this great principle was understood by the ancientSaints as will be seen by the words of the Apostle Paul addressed tothe Corinthians: "Else what shall they do which are baptized for thedead if the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for thedead?" (I Cor. 15, 29)

 OFFICE OF The First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day SaintsP.O. Box. B.Salt Lake City, Utah.May 1, 1891.President L. W. Shurtliff,C. H. Middleton and N. C. Flygare.Dear Brethren:The case that is now pending either before the High Council or Bishop'sCourt in which Elders Job Pingree and Nathan Tanner, jr. are parties, has been brough[t]to our attention. A copy of the resolution adopted by the High Council, and by which these parties were suspended from the privileges of the priesthood, and to a certainextent from membership in the church, has also been submitted to us. By this actionthese brethren are practically disfellowshipped; and Brother Nathan Tanner, jr. feelsvery deeply the serious consequences which attend the adoption of this resolution,and has appealed to us for relief. We do not know what reasons you had for taking this action previous to the hearing of the case, but naturally suppose you must havehad good reasons or you would not have adopted a resolution that is so unusual if no[t]extraordinary; but whatever reasons may be we think immediate steps should be taken [to]have the case tried and some decision reached concerning it so that these brethrenmay not be kept  in a position so exceedingly unpleasant to every one who values his standing in the church and in the priesthood. It may be that the parties themselvesare to blame for the delay; if they are they should be urged to take immediate action.If the delay be due to either of the tribunals, then we suggest that no time be lostin giving the case a hearing, as the passing of the resolution adopted by the council was three months ago. With kind regasrds,Your brethren,W WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F. Smith 
 Elder Woodruff made a few remarks, he said that thescripture doctrine was now reversed, where it said that a prophetwas not without honor save in own Country, for the whole nationwith the world to back them had risen up for the destruction of ourleaders and to break up this Church and Kingdom. He felt thathe would like to have some Angels or personages sent to occupythis Hall and the buildings in this City and throughout thisTerritory dedicated to the Lord, so that if our enemies came hereto desecrate our habitations and our public buildings the Angelsof the Almighty might be here to trouble them. He believed in the principle of dedicating this Hall to God. He felt that he wantedto dedicate his house and to pray that he might get the Holy Ghost upon him to such a degree that every ungodly man whoshould enter might be troubled. We have built and plantedand occupied our possessions a considerable time in peace in theseValleys and his prayer was that the Lord might bless us andgive continually his Holy Spirit, that we may learn to appreciateour blessings and privileges, and that we may so close to Godas to realize that we are his friends, and though this people maybe called to pass through straight places he was satisfied that itit was for the purpose of becoming more acquainted with thelaws of God; to secure our salvation and exaltation; to openthe way for the spread of the Gospel and the extension of the Kingand he felt that it was all right. This is a good room and isbuilt with taste and at considerable expense, and if we donot occupy it we shall get a reward, and somebody has gotto pay for these things; he believed it will cost a greater billbefore we get through with it, and he felt satisfied that thisvery room will be one means of ripening the world for the harves[t]We have heretofore had towns, hamlets, cities counties andStates to rise up against us, but never before had to stem thi[s]tide of the persecution of a whole nation. but our course isonward and we shall prevail over the combined powers of earth and hell, he was satisfied of this and he prayed thatwe might take hold of it like good soldiers.

The mission is at a very low ebb and it will take a superiorpower to raise it, but if we are successful herewe will have to shape circumstances and not let circumstances shape us, for this people

 will not put themselves out in any respect for religion.  The work is new here and all of the powers are arrayed against it and unless we have aid until we have become self sustaining, we will be a long time making a little show.  This is a large city and much advertising willhave to be done to ge the Gospel before the people.  If we fail to reach the peopleand make their food pallitable, we will not be remembered for our successes.  We feelsure of prosperity in this mission, for I believe that the harvest here is ripe, but owing to the natures of the elements which surround us here, we will have to have men and machinery to save the grain.  I thoroughly believe that this mission will become self sustaining but it may be some time.  I also believe that the means spent here will be a rich investment, and after a few days will return with an abundant increase.  I will write to my quorum and see if they can raise us some means to advertise with, for much of our success will depend upon our advertising.

 118-10th St., San Francisco, Cal. Nov. 19 [18]94.First Presidency of Church of Jesus Christ of L.D.S.Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brethren:Your favor of 15th inst. at hand.Elder John Mc Donald reached here in due time. Iwish there were some more of such men to comeand labor among their relatives if only for a few months.Yes! I have moved to the address of 118-10th St. Whilewe held services on 29-11th St, a family of peoplehad to live in the rooms below to reduce the rent, andwe roomed there ^with Bro. Mortensen^. When we changed our place oforholding services we had to move. We have two roomsat the present, on the second floor. A front room whichwe use for a bed-room and sleepingr sitting room, anda back room which we use for a kitchen. They cost us$15.00 a month. Any time Sister Tanner goes homeI can give up the kitchen, but a front room alone will cost$12.00. I have been to a great many places that were for rentand this is the best I could get. Rent seems very high.I have tried to investigate the nature of things hereand I think we need women here as well as men. If we could have a few ^worthy^ young men just marriedor with a small family called and sent here to help us thoroughly

 establish ourselves and make a solid foot hold here I think it would be a very wise thing. There are youngmen ^(with small families)^ in Utah, who could do much good here. If theyre couldbe such called here, who are propessional men and locatehere for a time, we would do well. I feel that it wouldbe a wise thing to do, if we intend to locate permanentlyin San Francisco. I am anxious to know if youfavor the idea. [Joseph Fielding Smith] ^I hardly think we can colonize Cal with missionary families at present.^I would like my wife to remain with me a while if youare willing, she is improving in health and I feel that itwill do her good. I also think that her influence andlabors among the sistes is for good. She can alsohelp me in many ways now that she is here; but ifyou think she should return to her people, informeme concerning the matter. She is desirous ofdoing what is right and if you think we can dobetter work by her returning she can go any timenow as my health is restored. ^I am willing his wife should remain if he desires it.^The work here is beginning to look brighter two appliedfor baptism last night, a young man and his wife.Please have a weekly news sent to C.

 118-10th St., San Francisco, Cal, Dec. 1-94.Prest. Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:Replying to your recent favors I can say that I have found a wholesale establishment where I can get our Mission cards printed at the rates of $1.00 per thousand in ten thousand lots, which is nearly as cheap again as you can have them done there, and three times as cheap as we got our others printed for which was $3.00 per thousand.I am satisfied with the answer you gave about colonizing California.I am also willing to be as economical as possible in the mission for I realize the stringency in money matters, but if we are successful here, we will have to have means until we get a thorough foot-hold. The mission is at a very low ebb and it will take a superior power to raise it, but if we are successful here we will have to shape circumstances and not let circumstances shape us, for this people 
 San Francisco. Aug 21 [18]94.First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of L.D. Saints.Dear Brethren:I take another opportunity of writing to you. Brother Williams and myself will not be able to do much until we get help. We want two Elders here as soon as they can conveniently come. You are acquainted with the brazenness of this field of labor and the nature of our work and the kind of men we need that is, men of patience,stability, and experience.Our prospects at the present are not by any means flattering, and the only way ^we^ will be able meet with success, is to put on a force that will be able to dig deep and pick out the few precious stones that have sunk in the rubbish.We are desirous of using every legitimate

 will not put themselves out in any respect for religion. The work is new hereand all of the powers are arrayed against it and unless we have aid until we have become self sustaining, we will be a long time making a little show. This is a large city and much advertising will have to be done to get the Gospel before the people. If we fail to reach the peopleand make their food pallitable, we will not be remembered for our successes. We feelsure of prosperity in this mission, for I believe that the harvest here is ripe, but owing to the natures of the elements which surround us here, we will have to have men and machinery to save the grain. I thoroughly believe that this mission will become self sustaning but it may be some time. I also believe that the means spent here will be a rich investment, and after a few days will return with an abundant increase. I will write to my quorum and see if they can raise us some means to advertise with, for much of our success will depend upon our advertising. 
 effort we have to reach this people.I will go to Sacramento ^to-morrow^ and see what can be done there.I hope you will be able put your hands on two Elders that can come right out we could put them to work to-morrow if we had them.I trust that the Lord will continue to prosper you ^and^ that we may be able to find that which is lost.Remember the two Elders, we need them right away.Your Brother in the GospelHenry S.

 Liverpool.May 10th, 1884.President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City,Utah.Dear Brother:Your very welcome of march 15th came safely to handso I wrote to you on the 20th of march, I have delayed answering you until now, not having of interest to write. I am of the opinion that the Legislature would have done well to have allowed the Governors action to have killed the Appropriation bill and have thrownthe responsibility upon him. I was also hoping that some spirited member would collect together a list of his infamous [s]ets both of a private and public nature and in a speach upon the floor of the house brand him as a villain, and club him with his own vile record, and have the same go upon the record, it is very likely however that memorial to Congress may answer every purpose. I am pleased to hear that the Indians in the south are taking hold on the Gospel, I trust that much good may come of it. We are just informed by the papers today that Miss Emily Faithfull is going to [lecture] against us in June, showing that the Ladies in Utah are in most fearful slavery or bondage. 
 The papers also says that one of our brethren has been sentenced to one months imprisonment at Viena for missionary work in that country. We had learned some days ago that this would be the case but Bro J. Q Cannon thought it would be for a much longer periodThe Elders who left home on April 15th came safely and had a very pleasant journey. Your son has been assigned to labor for the present in the Manchester Conference under the Presidency of Elder W D. Williams one of my most efficient Elders, I feel much pleased with the spirit manifested by him and the other young brethren. I feel certain that they will do much good just as soon as they get at work and fully interested. The spring has been cold and windy with but little rain, we could not hold outdoor meetings without endangering the health of the brethren.Tomorrow I attend meeting at Lowestoft the most easterly point of England and the former home of father Neslin, he built a small chapel for the saints there, but it has passed out of their hands. I must be off. We held a meeting in Shield Park and a few stopped and listened to us You will please give any kind regards to Bros Richards, Jaques and Pratt and any other who may enquire after me. Please remember me kindly to your family. My wife and child are well.With kind regard to you I am you brother in the Gospel.John Henry Smith 
 ^Liverpool^November 18th [188]4President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake CityDear Brother:Your very welcome letter of September 23rd came safely to hand, finding us on the enjoyment of good health and spirits. We published the items in your letter, correctingsome errors, that had appeared in the article that you wrote to us giving advice to young elders. I have not written to you for some time, from the fact that I had [littl[eof interest to communicate. Our missionary businessmoves quietly along here in Great Brittain. Since the killing of our brethren in Tennessee, the press of this country have been publishing all manner of vile stories on in regard to us. The P. P. Pratt and McLean affair, having figured prominently, in the articles that have been written from some quartersand garbled extracts from the Journal of discourses and Millennial Star, have been brought forward to sustain the charges made against us, and if possible to destroy the little seed sown. Quite a number of parties are also lecturing against us, among them Miss Emily Faithful, who paid a visit to our City I think in 1883. 
 Salt Lake Septr 25 [18]86.Prest. Wilford WoodruffDear Brother:Yesterday wecalled upon Albert Carrington,by request of Franklin D. Richardsand had some conversation withhim in regard to his case; he sayshe is willing to do anything requiredof him, if he can only be rebaptized.We found him quite feable, beingjust able to walk across the room,he claims to have paid his tithingand attended to his prayersregularly, always rememberinghis brethren, he harbors nofeelings against any one, andbears his testimony to the truthof the work, he will sign awritten complaint confession,admitting that he was guilty of 
 She has taken up the Mountain Meadow business, the Statements of Apostate mormon women and askes them up and deals them out to the gaping crowd her standing in society gives some weight to her utterances. It is hardly possible though for her to do us any particular injury, as her stories are of the old class having been exploded a hundred times. Another person by the name of Joseph Johnson is also regaling the people on the Isle of Man with a series of lectures in which he is retailing many things of a vile nature calculated to have a detrimental effect to the word in that part of the vineyard. He has secured quite a number of items in regard to family matters in Utah, to which he has added whatever the evil one might suggest to his mind,and with these he hopes to block up our way entirely on thelittle Isle. We have yet another, no less a person, than the notorious William Jarman, "who by the way is not far removed from insanity," he is travelling around the country, lecturing and giving an exhibition of some pictures, representing scenes as he claims have occured in the west. If I remember correctly I sent you a copy of the book from which he lectures, he takes particular pains to go wherever we have a branch of the church, rent a Hall, challenge our Elders to meet him, and whether they go or not, he attends our meetings on the sabbath day, listens quietly to what has been said till the services are over, and then commences an harrangue to the people, in which he uses such vile dirty language in regard to the endowments, and other things held sacred by us, that it is impossible for any one with any spirit to put apart it. I have instructed the elders and saints to keep away from his meetings, and that if he came to ours not to permit him to enter our Halls. On the 14th I received the following.John Henry Smith. Latter day devil Office, 42 Islington, Liverpool. Shall be in Liverpool shortly, when I shall require you to meet me in public debate, or prepare to leave Liverpool, for I shall not rest, so long as a missionary from Salt Lake remainsin Great Britain; I want you to discuss mormon doctrine and practice in Utah. you have my permanent address, have you any more letters from my ex wife yet. Wm JarmanThis fiend seems to be fully infused in the work he has taken in hand, and is laboring with satanic zeal, to excite the public mind against us. I am of the opinion however, that he crushed the mark so far, that no honest man can possible be deceived by his stories. I am at the present time settling in my own mind, what course to pursue in regard to sending an elder or two to Constantinople, and have about reached the conclusion, to have 
 adultry and asking the people toforgive him, he is not able, he says,to go before the public.Bro Grant cannot feel thatAlbert Carrington is humble or thathe fully appreciates the the greatcrime that he has committed,Bro. Smith feels that he is ashumble as it is possible for himto be with his organization, &that his mind is too weak tofully appreciate his conditionWith kind love & ever prayingGod to bless & preserve you, We areRespectfully Your Brethren,John Henry SmithHeber J. GrantP.S.We feel that Albert Carringtonis gradually losing his mind 
 Bro Spori who speaks the English, French, and German I beleive, go there. I feel impressed with the idea that some good will be accomplished. I shall however be compelled to assist him from this Office, as I am of the opinion he is unable to help himself. I shall drop later in Italy for the present, brother Andrew Villet spent a year there, and absolutely accomplished nothing. The people of that land are being scourged and it may be that after a time, some interest may be awakened.France was also dead to all the efforts made by Bro Bunotto get a foothold in that land. Brother Schoenfeld writes quite hopeful in regard to Austria, and I have written to him to have brother Beisinger make his way quickly again into that country and see, wether is is possible it is possible to make an opening. By letter from Elder Tanner from Berlin. I learn that there is a little opening in eastern Prussia, made by a local Elder, and that hopes are entertained quite an opening will be secured there,Brother Smoot has sufferred a little term of impresionment at Kiel for baptising a young girl under age. The Authorities of Bavariadrove the Elders from there as fast as we send them in, and in Switzerland, some spirit of antagonism is felt. By letters from Brothers Willes, McCune, and Pratt, India, that the prospects are not very bright there that the man Booth, who went with them, has been cut off from the church. The brethren find a few old time saints, who are very generous, and hope that the way will open up, by which they will accomplish some good. Scandinavia is still alive and baptisms are occurring regularly in the various parts of that mission. I now have 3 Elders in Ireland, and they report their prospects as being very good about 35 persons has been baptized in Belfast, and neighborhood and the prospects are good for more. The Elders that left home on the 11th of October, and also those who left on the 29th, reached here in Safety, all being in good health, having enjoyed themselves aside from a little seasickness, they have all been appointed to and gone forward to their various fields. Now comes their time of getting climated, and weaned from home, and its comforts, which, takes about 6 months in that time we usualy learn whether mens health will bear up in this climate or whither it is best for them to return home. The great struggle with the Elders now a days is to keep from getting discouraged, over their lack of success, nervous, active men, like to have some showing for their labor, and when they struggle for several months, without any seeming results, without they have got the pluck of a Paul, or the patienceof Job, they either tire out, become dispondent, and are anxious to go home. I have tried in every way to make 
 October 3rd 5.Lewis AllenSt. George;Dear Brother,Your most welcome favor of September 4th came far to my hands on the first of the present month, upon my return from three weaks visit to Ashley. Nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to have paid you a visit and had the chance of associating with our Dixie friends. Since my return to Utah I have been kept vary busy attending the various Stake Conferences being in some instances the only one of the Twelve able to go.Bro. Grant has been east.  Bros. SnowLyman, Young and Taylor South.  Bro Thatcher North and I have been going about as the spirit seemed to direct.  Bros Taylorand Cannon are well.  I saw the latter a few days ago.  I have learned nothing about the row in London. 
 July 30 [188]4President Wilford Woodruff.Salt Lake CityDear Brother.Yours of July 10th came safely to hand and found uswell here in the office. The Article we were pleased to receive.It will give encouragement to the Elders many of whom arelaboring without any seeming return bonds of warning exhortat[io]n Counsell or testimony are received with grattitude by us allMany if us are young men Some men advanced in years butyoung in experience in the ministry and when Elders likeyourself grown grey in the service drop words of encouragementor counsell or Iexplain your own experiences they help usto despel our own little troubles and take gold with renewedvigir to push forward the cause of our God. It is the hardestthing that an Elder has to do to day to keep from becomingdespondent. for to travel from weeks end to weeks end withoutgathering any fruit requires a man to posess in a largedegree the sunshine if the Holy spirit in his composition.Elder W D Williams President of the Manchester Conference speaksin high terms of the earnestness your son displays in performing 
 I received letters from J.F. yesterday, he was quite well when he wrote.Our enemies are feeling quite fabulous over Bp Sharps fall.  They are making every effort they can to catch me. but have failed up to the presant.  I expect several of the brethren of the Twelve will attend conference at Logan.  The Mexican business thus far is all a failure, no land yet.I feel that the present pressure upon us was very necessary where we see so many of the brethren go to the wall willing to cry enoughI am happy and well and pray the Lord to bless and ^prosper^ you.  May you have the revelations of the Lord to guide you in all of your movements.I am your fellow servant in Christ.John Henry Smith 
 every mans mission successful, by persuading them to remain at their post, faithful and true. this can be done in most instances, but occasionally it is impossible to [revive] men.Your suggestion in regard to outdoor preaching, I had already put into practice by warning the elders to keep watch upon each other and to give advice when either was taking hurt,from over exertion on the score named. When elders get off to themselves, they are sometimes filled with Zeal and injure themselves without anyone knowing that they are in the least taking hurt. I have very little faith in the outdoorpreaching as to the good that will result therefrom. All we can accomplish by it is warning the people. In the past 2 Years I believe but 2 persons have come forward and received the ordinances of the gospel as the result of the outdoor work so far as I can learn. And it is a granquestion in my mind, whether we aint doing more harm to our Elders by keeping them in this labor, than we are doing good to the human family by warning them in this manner. I have however felt to crowd the brethren to this work, as the only means by which they could get an experience in public speaking, and bring out within them full faith and a reliance upon God, for no extremely timid man can stand the racket, and face these crowds of people and testify to the mission of Joseph Smith. It requiresiron nerves and iron wills. Some of the Conferences in England are becoming very thinly populated, Norwich Conference,has left it it, only about 30 active members. The Bristol Conference which takes in Cornwall, and several other counties is said to only furnish 4 beds to the elders without paying for them. The Leeds Conference is nearly in the same [fix's] In these conferences where there are but few people I have crowded the elders out, so that they might open make openings where the gospel has not been preached for some years to any great extent, they dont however meet with any great success, and report that they are either compelld theirtheir beds, buy their food, or remain out in the weather, and suffer from hunger, portions of other conferences of the mission continue to do pretty well in furnishing places to sleep and something to eat for the elders, but the day seem to be gone by, when the saints take any responsibility in aiding to clothe them, other portions of these conferencesseem to be barren and fruitless. At the present time, trade is very bad, in ^all^ the Ship building sections of the country thousands of men ar out of employment, and as a result of this, great distress, is felt in their families 
 his duty, he is a young man of considerable promise and will no doubt bring gladness to your heart for his faithfulnessand fidelity in the field. There can be no greater joy to a Fatherthat has devoted his life to the interest of a cause that heknows is true than to have his children ceasing hold of theiron rod and following in the paths of honour continuing his work and perpetuating his name. I am becoming very muchinterested in trying to open up a mission to Turkey. I have been inCorrespondence for some months with a Turkish gentlemanone of whose letters I sent to Bro Taylor some time ago. I herewithenclose one to you I would like two missionaries, men whohave some taste for learning languages, and who could go tothat country and make a successful effort in introducing thegospel in that land. You may have already considered thisMatter, but you can read the letter to the brethren in order thatthey may judge of the spirit of it. I am pleased that Congress has again adjourned which will give the country a little peaceIt is a fearful thing that the people should stand in dread oftheir lawmakers, and but for the faith of the saints in God theycertainly would. England is passing through another trying experiencein her political affairs. The Liberal ministry has tryed to enfranchise2 Millions of Men the law passed the commons, but the House ofLords, have made an effort to stop the law, not daring to reject itentire, they have tied it up in some form which prevents for thepresent at least its passage. Popular demonstrations are theorder of the day and while this is done peaceable there ismuch clamour among the masses for a change in the consti-tution which will do away with the House of Lords ormake them elective by the people. You have no doubt seenin the Telegrams, the unearthing of some scandals in Dublin.It seems to be an open secret, that quite a number of Gentlemen moving in higher circles are charged with thecrime of sodomy. These parties have been arrested and arebeing quietly investigated, that crime will bring transporta-tion for life if proven guilty. One of the Judges of the AssignCourt of this County was found dead in a home of Ill famea few days ago. He died in the arms of his paramour thisalso is being secretly investigated. Cholera and small poxor talk of them at least seems to be in the very air. Our nextCompany will leave on August 30th, there will be in theneighbourhood of 30 returning elders, most of them will havebeen away from home nearly two years and have labord asa rule to the best of their ability. Some men are not missionariesand they cannot help it doing the best they can in the circumstances in which they are placed. Young men should be sent here 
 I am pleased to report to you that your son is an earnest and efficient laborer in the vineyard, and he is making every effort possible to qualify himself to become a polished shaft in the hands of the Almighty for the preaching of the gospel to the nations. I look upon him as one of my most promising elders. I intend changing him after a little while to the London Conference, which will extend his experience and give him some extended ideas in regard to men & things. Young Utah are gems in the field if they only get a proper send off. We see by the papers that old satan is very active. He no doubt got a little set back however on the 4th of November. It is a little singular that a fellow who hath Republican tendencies should be inclined to shout hurah when a Democrat comes into power, not that I expect any particular changes from the efforts of the new man, but while the devil is stopping to spit on his hands the Kingdom of God is gaining strength You no doubt had an excellent time at Conference and that the Lord was with you in power all the brethren testify who speak of being there. I have 3 elders in the mission who have been out over two years I shall release them to return home sometime during the winter. My health and spirits are first class I have overtaxed my eyes a little with study, but they will be all right when they have a little rest Give my kind regards to all the brethren and accept a share yourself.I am your fellow laborer in the vineyard of our LordJohn Henry Smith
