Soon men &amp; dogs were on the ground from Camp but it became dark &amp; the dogs would not follow &amp; we gave up the chase I was 20 rods from the Brethren when the bear attacked them &amp; did not see it. There were two antilope killed to day and a Frenchman 18 mile that was travelling in Company with us shot a vary fat buffalo cow &amp; distributed a good share of it in our camp which was excellent eating there was also two buffalo bulls killed today    ENDENTRY September 19, 1847    river to get some buffalo cows in a herd near by, in the chase Br  Mathews horse fell with him but did not hurt him, the others continued  on &amp; killed one cow &amp; two black tailed deer while this was going on the Twelve with many others went up the creek to see if they could get the bears but we could not find them I came in sight of 3 deer &amp; shot 3 times at them with a coarse sighted rifles &amp; shot over them evry time Brother Barnham shot one of them I went a little above &amp; saw about 50 Antilope in a flock feeding on the plain I got within 30 rods of one of them &amp; shot him dead in his tracks I brought  my horse up to put him onto his back to pack him into Camp and I laboured hard one hour before I could get the horse willing to let me  put the animal on his back I was 5 miles from camp &amp; walked &amp; led my horse in the antilop was fat.

I started for the horses which was in the timber about half a mile from Camp I got about two thirds of the way to the horses when one of the most exciting seenes  I herd the report of several ^guns^ in quick succession and herd the guard cry   ENDENTRY  with mounted Indians charging with all speed upon our guard, horses &amp; camp they shot at two or three of the guard but missed them they took one of the guard &amp; tryed to carry him off on a horse. He knocked one of them down with his fist &amp; got away from them some of the Brethren snaped their guns at them but they did not go off, as soon as I herd the report of the guns, &amp; the cry of Indians &amp; saw  them driving off our horses &amp; gathering thick &amp; fast upon every hand &amp; being without either horse or arms I run to the camp with  all speed &amp; gave the alarm &amp; called upon all to gather their arms &amp; mount their horses. Brothers Mathews, &amp; ^99^ several others sprung onto their horses with their guns &amp; pistols &amp; run to stop the horses which the Indians were taking away one party of  Indians had driven 5 or 6 Horses &amp; Mules over the Hills Br Kimball took after them. two Indians had gone over the Bluff with my Horse &amp; Mule Brother Rockwood took after them. At the same time about 20 horses came rushing toward Camp which the Indians had frightend Br Young with great exhertion with the assistance of one or two other Brethren succeding in stoping them &amp; getting them into camp. As soon as I arived in camp I opened my trunk  took out my belt containing 8 pistol shots &amp; harnessed it onto myself as quick as possible put a saddle &amp; bridle onto a broken down horse for the want of a better one &amp; I mounted without  spur or whip &amp; started for the chase after my own horses. I  could not travel vary fast over the rough ground &amp; bluffs on a  poor horse but I went as fast as I could. As soon as I left camp I began to rise the bluffs I saw Indians gathering thicker &amp; faster upon every hand &amp; began to close in between me &amp; the camp. As I passed by one Indian he was priming his gun. But I continued the chase As soon as my horse &amp; mule got over their fright &amp; got out of  sight of camp, they tryed to return to camp &amp; troubled the Indians  about driving them and Brother Rockwood soon came near  them and one stoped &amp; met him when they found they were overtaken &amp; professed friendship the other still tried to drive off the horses Br Rockwood fired a pistol at him &amp; he run &amp; left the horses &amp; the other Indian left also &amp; Rockwood  horses towards ^me^ I soon came up to his assistance &amp; some other Brethren also came up &amp; assisted me in ketching them &amp; while I was doing this near 40 Indians surrounded Br Kimball who started for the other horses. some of the Brethren started to his assistance after I had started for camp with my horses. Indians were also upon evry side of me untill I got into camp I secured my horses insid the camp and by this time about 150 warriors had gatherd to gether close to our camp all dressed in the greatest stile for a war charge and the old chif began to address to the top of his  the Indians and also our camp, t they thought we were Crows or snakes. When they found they could not get any more of our horses &amp; 3 had been retaken which they stole they then  professed friendship there was 11 horses taken by the Indians they number ed at about 200 warriors on the ground &amp; well mounted &amp; their was not over 20 of our men including the guard that was engaged in any way in stoping the horses, or saving them, or retaking those that were stolen. Br Gould  took one Indian horse &amp; all and another Indian brought back Thomas  Woolsays horse which was among the stolen &amp; exchanged him for the Ind ians horse, this with my two horses were the ownly ones retaken during the skirmish. But when the Indians gatherd before the camp they saw we   ENDENTRY  them kindly while on our way to the valley. the old Chief then proposed  that we smoke the pipe of peace. And also said that if our chief pointing  to President Young would go to their Camp they would smoke with him &amp; give him up the horses which his men had taken but Brother Young did  not feel well &amp; we did not think it prudent for him to go, while in this  conversation Br Kimball who had been out on the chase after the horses  returned bare headed (having droped his hat) was accompanied by Br Benson  &amp; in riding into camp rushed his horse through the midst of the Indians  &amp; they fearing some treachery or that he was an enemy coming upon them  in their rear, they instantly leaped upon their horses, scattered &amp; rushed from  the camp some runing into the creek all appeared in great fright. But as soon  as they saw there was no evil at hand they returned &amp; took their places &amp;  had a harty laugh at their fright. Br Kimball volenteered to accompanied  the Chief into his camp in the place of Br Young that we might get our  horses I volunteered &amp; also Stephen Markham to go with Br Kimball on the expedition so we three mounted our horses &amp; set out accompanied  by a Frenchman (who could speak a little sioux language) &amp; the Indians to  find their Camp; they told us it was one mile we travled 7 miles over  Bluffs &amp; valleys &amp; came in sight of their Camp some 3 miles from us  moving towards us. so we called a halt &amp; waited for them to come up they came &amp; pitched about 100 lodges &amp; their was about 600 Indians  many women &amp; children &amp; they brought with them about 1000 horses &amp;  mules nearly all of them we supposed were stolen from emigrants &amp;  &amp; other tribes. their encampment presented quite a grand, interesting &amp; amusing  scenery among their horses we readily discoverd ours which was stolen  the night we camped we camped with Br Grants Company we lost  49 that night which they had among their number. The old Chief called  the war Chiefs &amp; placed them on his left hand &amp; ourselves on his right &amp; set down  upon the grass &amp; filled a long pipe with Kennickenick &amp; smoked &amp; passed it  to his Chiefs they smoked &amp; passed it to us we also smoked he then pointed to  us to pick out our horses which we undertook to do but found it no easy  task to pick out 7 or 8 horses scattered through one thousand others for  one or two miles up &amp; down the creek however after a laborious search  we got all but two that was stolen this morning. We then spoke to him  about the 49 horses which they had stolen from us before, they ackn owledged they had got the horses &amp; gave us some incouragement of  letting us have them when they got to Laramie but would not let us  have them then they however let us have one of them ownly the brethren brought about 3 bushels of salt as a present to him we then  returned to camp with our horses, which ended the business of the  day the Camp did not move but few rods I travled about 18 m It rained some during the night    ENDENTRY September 22, 1847    not vary tedious we thought it wisdom to leave the ground &amp;  continue our journey we travled 18 miles &amp; camped on Bitter  creek we had but little grass but plenty of water 18 mile    ENDENTRY September 23, 1847    spring we did not get through untill 9 oclok at night the moon shone most briliantly we took our horses forward to the spring to  water them &amp; then drove our waggons on the South road half a mile.

The hump bones of a fat  buffalo roasted is the most choice eating of any meat kind  the leg bones are also filled with marrow more choice than  butter &amp; yield a great quantity which we roasted &amp; drank  the melted marrow without bread. We should have made  a delightful picture for an artist to have drawn the scenery  around our fireside. After all had eaten to our full satisfaction  we prepared to make our beds for the night, it was cold &amp; blew  a perfect gale. we made choice of a thicket of willows under a bank  for our lodging place for the night we lay down on the ground &amp; covered  ourselves over with our blankets &amp; robes &amp; had a good nights rest 12.

After returning to the Bluffs we found  that the herds on the upland were travling to the N. &amp; N.E &amp; the ownly  way to obtain meat was for the hunters to confine themselves to the herds on the flat they did so &amp; killed nine buffalo but seven of them  was dressed &amp; brought in &amp; wolves feasted on the other two. we got  council from Camp for us to return early in the morning &amp; not  tary any longer, we travled in our hunt during the day 16 m    ENDENTRY October 19, 1847    19 company of hunters started a little before the waggons, we had got  about a mile on the way when we discoverd 7 men about 2  miles from us coming from some scattering timber we at first  took them to be Indians on foot we saw they were approach- ing us we soon found however they were mounted white men  we then thought they were troops. they soon charged upon  us with all speed, we stood ready with our arms in hand  to meet them, but when they came up to our great surprise  &amp; joy we found them to be the Policce of Winter Quarters led  by Brother Hosea Stout. they informed us that 16 of them had  come from Winter Quarters to meet our camp thinking we might need some help the remainder of the party stoped at our  main camp, we stoped our teams &amp; returned with then to  our camp ground &amp; got the Brethren some breakfast out of the fat   ENDENTRY  about our wives &amp; children &amp; friends &amp; affairs at Winter Quarters &amp; they  were truly welcome messengers &amp; like Angels unto us.

C. Kimball addressed the Council &amp; said that he had been to the mountains &amp; got an endowment &amp; felt it in his bones &amp; want- ed to talk a little, he said the day had come when iniquity could  not be harboured in the Church, and men because they belong to my family or Br Brigham Youngs family will not be screened in wickedness I wo- uld even turn over to the law of God sons out of my own loins if they done wrong, will I suffer iniquity to go unpunished in others more than in my own sons? I tell you nay. Br Andrews has been adopted into family but let the law of God have its demand upon him if it takes his head off for a man had better  Hell with all his members. The accusations against Br Andrews were then read some he acknowledged to &amp; some were proven against him after which President Young addressed the   ENDENTRY  man by seeking that which did not belong to him would loose that which he seemeth to have as in this case Br Andrews by  unlawfully marrying this woman is now left without any wife there is no Elder in this church who has any right to marry a woman to a man who has a living wife, many men act like fools as soon as they get an idea that women should obey their husbands &amp; be passive in their hands they will go to the woods &amp; get a bundle of sticks &amp; com- mence whiping their wives to make them obey them in the first place a husband should be a righteous man a man of God &amp; rule his  houshold in righteousness &amp; govern his wife with kindness &amp; love &amp; not with a rod, club, or his fist, his conduct to his wife should be such that she will love him with all of her heart and he should pray to God that his wife &amp; children which are jewels given him might be saved &amp; not taken from him that not any thing need be lost which the father hath given him. He said that many men through their con- duct would have taken from them that which they had &amp; given to another. He said that when a man had a jewel given to him he ought to prize it &amp; treasure it up &amp; take good care of it &amp; in process of time other jewels might be given him of the Lord, but he should not undertake to  steal them for he could not keep them, and a man should not be in a hurry to obtain any blessing or exhaltation that is not for him &amp; when he has proved himself faithful in all things before God there is no good thing that will be withheld from him in  time or Eternity &amp; many other good instructions were given    &amp; gave it as his opinion that Br Andrews ought to be cut off from the Church for adultery, most of the quorum of the Twelve  spoke upon the subject also the presidents of the Seventies after which it was moved &amp; carried that Milo Andrews be cut off from the church for adultery. it was also moved and carried  that the woman be cut off from the Church f was moved &amp; carried that they both be left in the hands of the Presidents of the Seventies meeting then adjurned and the Twelve went into the recorders office &amp; met in council    ENDENTRY December 22, 1847    prepared for the Press some other letters read    ENDENTRY December 23, 1847    the night at Council Point we had a meeting I addressed the meeting and was followed by Brother Joseph Young we had a good meeting 10 m    ENDENTRY December 24, 1847       by O.

The names of the seventies was  then called over and President Young remarked that it would not  be necessary to put them or be organized into quorums while here but  remain in a body under their presidents untill they arived at the valley, that while any quorum of the seventies of twelve were full  though they might be scattered to the fore corners of the earth  would not be filled up in Zion or any place but when there was a vacancy by death or aposticy then the vacancy might be filled we learned from President to keep up a full organization of the Church through all time  as far as could be at least the three first Presidency quorum of the Twelve Seventies, and Patriarch over the whole Church &amp;c so that the devil could take no advantage of us.    the appointing of the first Presidency and Patriarch over  the whole Church others spoke upon the subject.

The Twelve Apostles with their brethren, one  hundred and fourty three souls as pioneers have made a journey more  than one thousands miles to the Rocky mountains and sought out a  place for a city, a stake of Zion, and a Temple of the Lord that the saints  may have a place to flee to while the indignation of the Lord passeth  over the nation that hath driven them out. Our Journey to the mountains  &amp; back again to Winters Quarters with horse, mule, and ox teams has been over  2000 miles more than half of the journey we have had to make new roads  &amp; with all of our exposures, sickness, &amp; dangers not a human life has been lost  but all returned in safety and what is more singular still, not a horse mule  ox, cow, or calf was lost either going or returning except 2 horses shot by disobeying  council. The blessing of the Lord has been great upon us as a people during  the past year in all the various portions of the Camp of Israel. we have  now found a place to build a Stake of Zion whare the people can gather  together &amp; build up Zion. The past year has shown forth the fulfi- llment of Prophecy in the wars, rumours of wars, famins, pestilence,  distress of nations with perplexity and in many of the signs of the  times. The United States in their wars with the feble Nation of  Mexico have involved themselve in a debt of one hundred and fifty  millions of dollars besides the loss of twenty five thousand men  &amp; twice that number to Mexico and their own expenses in the war, the  famine has raged in Ir of banks &amp; merchants has distressed the people in England.

But the organization of man is such that it requires a variety, singing stimulates the whole system &amp; the mental mind to such a degree that they want to dance, this is well enough in its place, every thing that is calcula ted to fill the soul with Joy is ordained of God &amp; is pr the Saints if they acknowledge God in all things &amp; do not sin but dont mingle with the wicked world &amp; sin but serve the Lord with it. And the ownly lawful place to dance is in a tem- ple or a place of endowments, you will never see any music or danceing in Hell neither Joy or gladness will be there but these things will be in Heaven many other interesting rema- rks were made.    the old grey headed man, with the young man, maiden and children went forth in the dance together &amp; praised the Lord in the dance and all was peace and harmony   ENDENTRY January 18, 1848    &amp; giving council, the Twelve occupied most of the time Two petitions were presented to the meetings for signitures one for a county in the Potawattame tract of land in Iowa and the other for a Post Office and the People were signing them daily Br Henry Miller and others were appointed to go to the Legislature of the State of Iowa to petition for the county &amp; $30 were raised by the people ^to^ bear their expenses many interesting speaches were made by the people    music &amp; danceing, and at the close of the evening this  congregation were dismissed &amp; other branches of the church were to take it tomorrow as all could not get into the House at the same time    ENDENTRY January 19, 1848    part of the day was taken up as usual with teaching, instruction &amp; council &amp; the spirit of the Lord was with us. the after noon &amp; evening was as usual spent in singing, music, &amp; dancing, square Merit, the Soux Indian agent, A Major, capt &amp; Lieut. from Fort Carney were present and seemed to be pleased with the appearance of things    ENDENTRY January 20, 1848    at the Log tabernacle, the congregation was addressed at some length by Br G A. Smith upon a variety of subjects giving advise to the saints not to locate on the river bottom but go to the bluffs &amp; north whare there is a plenty of timber &amp; open farms whare there is plenty of room also advised them to pay their tithing &amp; not admit of making use of ardent spirits, &amp; spoke upon  other subjects &amp; was followed by W. Woodruff who backed up the testimony of Br Smith after which several business matters were taken up.    &amp; dancing at the close, President Young addressed the meeting in an interesting manner, and said he wished the Saints to get so quick in their understandings that when they herd his tex that they might know his whole sermon without his preaching it or stoping to explain evry item. And his text was   country here and go to danceing sin and iniquity will grow out  of it but all has been right here thus far I have watched you &amp; all has been in quiete &amp; peacable &amp; good order &amp; the spirit of the Lord has been here. And the President dissmissed the people pronounceing the blessings of God upon the people. I with several other of the brethren spent my time with Br Richards who was vary kind in entertaining the Saints    ENDENTRY January 21, 1848    it had been exeeding warm &amp; plesant during our whole visit at the Log tabernacle meeting &amp; we found all well on our return home. Br's Nauvoo &amp; returned to Winter Quarters with us &amp; brought some papers giving an account of the wars &amp; distress of nations with famine Pestilence &amp; Judgment   ENDENTRY January 22, 1848       ENDENTRY January 23, 1848    by Brs Pulsipher &amp; Porter &amp; we had a good time and in the eve ning I went to the Council House and met with a large assembly Professor Pratt addressed them quite lengthy upon asstronomy philosophy, and various principles which he had studied much upon and also read a lengthy document which he had written which was highly interesting to us. He advised the seventies to devote all of their leasure moments to reading &amp; study &amp; fulfill the commandments which says we should treasure up wisdom &amp; knowledge by faith &amp; by study out of the best books that we may have a knowledge of things in heaven &amp; on earth of kingdoms &amp; countries things which are at home &amp; abroad, the wars perplexities of nations  Professor Pratt he intirely overthrows many of the systems of modern phylosiphers &amp; asstronomiers &amp; modern reasoning in many respects, to overthrow the gentile Christian Argument, "that God made the Heavens Sun, moon, &amp; stars and the earth &amp; all that in them are out of   stars had been discoverd through telescopes so remote from the earth that it would take  this earth though it should travel at the rate of two hundred thousand  miles per second, so it must have been in exhistance 24000 years before this earth was formed. He overthrows the principle of Immate- riality &amp; clearly shows that God, Angels, spirits, are material as well as men, beasts, vegitables minerals, &amp;c that matter is eternal &amp; infinite without end or bounds &amp; that space is infinite &amp; without bounds or end that matter, the elements, intelligence were not created neither  indeed can be, &amp; were from all eternity &amp; that God formed the Heavens &amp; earth out of unorganized materials or matters which did exhist in some form &amp; were not made out of nothing. In speaking of the spirit of God he remarked to me that the Holy Spirit that was through all things, and round about all things, &amp; that governed &amp; controlled all things are intelligent atoms the same as God is composed of hence it is called the spirit of God, &amp; he had no dobt but that there were some of these atoms combined in all the miner- al, vegitable, &amp; animal Kingdoms &amp; by the aid of those intelligent atoms were enabled to abide the law by which they were governed many other interesting principles were presented by Professor Pratt when he closed I followed him and exhorted the people to listen  to his council &amp; improved their time I also advised the Camp  to hold meetings in each ward on Sunday &amp; prayer meetings at  least one evenings in each week that if they would pray more they would have much less spirit of complaining among them I remarked that the spirit of the Lord &amp; the spirit of the devil would not dwell together but a short time in the same  person or tabernacle but one would govern &amp; the other leave I also warned the people against judging any matter whatever untill they herd both sides of the question for in most all  cases any person would be apt to give a wrong judgment by merely hearing one side of the question. And that the Elders could not be in possession of any to much truth upon any subject whatever in order to magnify there callings among the nations of the earth for if they should be called to stand before Kings Princes, Asstronomiers Phylosophiers &amp; the learned of the earth they would find use for all there knowledge   ENDENTRY January 24, 1848    a charge prefered by the Policee against E. D Wolley for making use of sedicious language against the Authorities of the Church the letter of the accusation was sustained against Br Wolley but it was not supposed by any that the spirit of sedition was in his heart. It proved to be an interesting meeting as much teaching &amp; instruction was drawn out of the Presidency High Council, Twelve &amp;c. Br Wooley in his plea expressed his  feelings that the Hickery Clubs carried by the policee, &amp; the council for Bishops to preside over any parties in the place to keep order, and that the Policee would not suffer a man to let his own cattle get into his own crops to destroy them were oppressive to his feelings. President Young said he wanted to speak upon the  spirit of the thing with Br Wolleys, that the things that oppress Br Wolley been right with him but he had got the spirit of the world &amp; did not feel right. Said that the law was for the unruly &amp; that  it must rest upon good men in order to reach the unruly &amp; transgresser. many gave their opinion upon the subject Br Wooley made his confession that he had spoken in an im- proper manner in a moment of passion he was forgiven by the council &amp; all was settled. W. Woodruff in his remarks said  he would advise evry individual not to make any decision or give any judgment or opinion upon any subject whatever untill they herd both sides of the question, Council was dismissed  &amp; we returned home. Brs Levi Richards &amp; myself visited Br Henman's family to administer to them for the whole family was sick &amp; had been troubled with evil spirits we  prayed with this family &amp; laid hands upon 7 that were sick of the household the spirit of the Lord was with us &amp; we rebuked the sickness &amp; commanded the evil spirits  to depart &amp; they recieved a blessing upon the family. Br's Pratt &amp; Richards returned to my house &amp; spent several  hours in conversing about science, Phylosophy, Astronomy, and a variety of things of interest    ENDENTRY January 25, 1848    John Snider they made a report of  affairs at Young did not wish the temple to be sold and a number of other things were spoken of some little difference of feelings settelled during the evening I attended meeting in our ward    ENDENTRY January 26, 1848    the evening at Br Neff.

The Saints wore a  read badge on the left arm to distinguish them from their  enemies in the battle, they wore the same to day at the feast at  the opening of the performences President Kimball deliverd an address upon the subject of the Battle of Nauvoo &amp; was followed by Col Johnson, after which their was feasting singing music &amp;  some dancing. A figure was got up called the Battle of Nauvoo  which their deliverance    ENDENTRY February 4, 1848       ENDENTRY February 5, 1848    loaded &amp; brought home five loads of wood    ENDENTRY February 6, 1848    Richards ward &amp; had a good time    ENDENTRY February 7, 1848    the voice of  views of the powers &amp; policy of the government of the United  States, and corres appeal to the green mountain Boys, correspondence with, John  C. Calhoon, and Missouri, and an  interesting sermon from President Smith. These letters &amp;  writings are of much interest &amp; show the spirit of the tim- es &amp; the mighty rebuke of wicked men by that great, good,  &amp; wise Prophet Joseph I was much edifyed in reading it  I spent the evening in reading the book of Jasher &amp; was  edifyed with that Br Benbow &amp; myself laid hands upon a  sick youth    ENDENTRY February 8, 1848    house in the evening I gave a synopsis of my meditations  concerning our duties as a people   ENDENTRY February 9, 1848    I finished reading the Book of Jasher &amp; found it to be  an interesting work. It speaks of the great victories  the Twelve Patriarchs the sons of Jacob accomplished in  their Battles with their enemies in consequence of their great  faith in God and of Joseph career in Egypt &amp; many other  interesting things    ENDENTRY February 10, 1848    blue broad cloth which I got in England I spent a part  of the day with Br Young I walked with him from the  office to Br Warner Porters whare President Young administered  in the ordances of the house of the Lord. I read several papers from the eastern states which gives an account of the dredful  famine in Ireland more than 130,000 persons have died in the  famine and apparently the destress has but just began, also the  the breaking of the banks and large firms throughout England  which has caused a great panic &amp; much perplexity throughout  those nations the United States are still at war with Texas  &amp; much division in the government concerning the war    ENDENTRY February 11, 1848 ~ Friday to  ENDENTRY February 12, 1848    days at home reading writing &amp; choreing    ENDENTRY February 13, 1848    FIGURE I ever saw in the winter time. The Camp of of the  Saints met at the stand for a meeting to day meeting opened  by singing, &amp; prayer by W. Woodruff,   and said that he wanted to give an exhertation and a word of  caution and after reproving the saints said many flattered  themselves that they were going to lean upon others to save  them without doing any thing themselves but they will  get disappointed, for to bring up a figure he said you might graft ever so many sproughts into a tree if they did not adhear  to the tree they would remain there dead sticks stick- ing out of the tree they would be dead themselves, not  bring forth fruit, &amp; do the tree no good but ownly scar  it up, &amp; those scars would remain untill the dead sticks  were bro put in that would bring forth fruit. So it was with all  who leaned upon others to save them &amp; would not  harken to their council &amp; take their advice &amp; no man  can save them if do not save themselves and many  other remarks of Interest he made.    had translated it from the greek    settle on the east side of the river not to settle on the  bank or in the bottoms so that the first flood need  not wash them into the Mo river.    after which in company with Mrs Woodruff I went to  Br Young &amp; Kimball came  &amp; attended to sealing four couple in matrimony, we had  a feast of spruice beer &amp; cakes on the occasion   ENDENTRY  being 3 of their presidents present, Z. Pulsipher  A. P. Rockwood the House was crouded to excess the meeting was opened by singing &amp; prayer. And was then addressed  by A P Rockwood who spoke upon the government of  children that Parents ought to set a good exhample before  their children &amp; not nickname them but call them by  their proper name for the way that Parents set their  children going in life they are apt to go through &amp; if they  start with Jim, Jo, &amp; Pall, they are apt to go through  life so,.    interesting remarks. And he was followed by President  Joseph Young who reproved them in the spirit of the Lord  against the spirit of dancing &amp; warned them to forsake all  sin &amp; be faithful in all things He spoke in the spirit and power  of God feeling the responsibility he was under when he closed  his remarks W. Woodruff arose and said that should  I say that I did not desire to address the Seventies I should do  dishonor to my own feelings for I do desire it at this time.  All who know my course when I have been at head quarters with  the Presidency either with Joseph, Brigham, or others of the twelve  know that I have never put myself forward to preach or teach  the people, why hath it been so, because I have had file leaders  between me and God whose business it is to lead teach &amp; instruct  the inhabitants of Zion and I have felt it more my duty to sit  &amp; hear while with them at head quarters than to put myself  forward to teach yet when I have been called upon to speak  I have endeavoured to do the best I could, but when I have  been abroad in the vineyard I have had the spirit of my  mission &amp; been much blessed in bringing souls into the  kingdom of God. And I do feel it a privilege to address  the Seventies at this time, Br Young asked me to speak in  the fore part of the evening but I desired to wait untill the  Presidency of Seventies had address them and I can now see  that it was wisdom for I should not have had the same  matter before me that I now have, I have a number of things  resting upon my mind which I wish to lay before you. Your  President Joseph Young has spoken to you in the spirit &amp; power  of God to night has warned &amp; exhorted you not to defile your Priesthood &amp; calling &amp; not to have your minds all taken  up with fiddleing &amp; dancing. I have taken  ment this evening in hearing the teaching giving by your  Presidency than I would in hearing a million of dollars worth  of fiddle strings worn out, you must not think hard of  Br Joseph Young because he reproves, rebukes, &amp; e with all long sufferings &amp; doctrin, for their is an almighty  responsibility resting upon his shoulders as the seenier President  of this August body of Sevenenties ordained unto the Apostle- ship and the Lord will hold him responsible for the manner  that he watches over the Seventies and he is stired up from time  to time by the spirit of the God of Israel to reprove you and  the rebukes of a friend are far better than the kisses of an  enemy and you must not think hard of Br Young if he  does reprove you for he does it for your good. It is for better for  you to spend your time getting instruction &amp; council than in  fiddleing &amp; dancing for while the latter is of no profit to you the  former you will need when you are seperated far from your Brethren   ENDENTRY  Judgments of God which are laying waste the people &amp; while  you have to dodge between wind &amp; water to save your head in the midst of  you are offering salvation to the people. I have meditated  much of late concerning the responsibility we are  under to God inasmuch as we bear the priesthood &amp; are  numbered among the Lords Anointed as Angels are watching us &amp; bearing a report of us daily to God should  the Lord come down to see us to see for himself if the  reports of us was correct, what would the Lord think of  us &amp; how would we like to hear the record read in the morning  of the resurrection containing an account of an assembly  of the Lords Anointed at Winter Quarters, upon whom  all heaven leaned &amp; depended upon in carrying out the  purposes of the Lord in the  of times and fulfilling the expectations of Abraham, Isaac  &amp; Jacob &amp; all the Holy Prophets &amp; Apostles since the world  began in gathering the Jews &amp; rebuilding Jerrusalem gathering  the saints &amp;  endowment of the ten tribes of Israel in the north country  &amp; the covertion of the Lamanites in the west, &amp; the  warning of all the gentile world that they may be left  without excuse when the Judgments of God cleanse the earth  from sin, wickedness, &amp; pollution, and that our prayers should ascend into the heavens for the Lord to avenge the  Blood of the Prophet Joseph &amp; other saints who have been  martered &amp; slain by gentile mobs in the last days, while  there is so much depending upon us &amp; our prayers should  we be satisfyed with the record of this city of the Saints in the  eternal world kept by the Angels of Heaven If we should  hear read before an assembled world that the inhabitants  of Winter Quarters who were the Lords Anointed during  the winter of 1847 &amp; 8 spent nine days of their time  in fiddleing &amp; dancing whare they did one in prayer &amp;  praise to almighty God, I say would we be satisfyed  with such record? No we would not, then let us turn from  such seenes of folly &amp; spend more time in meetings  for preaching, exhortation, &amp; prayer before the Lord  Br Joseph exhorted the Elders "not to defile their Priesthood."  I will here say If any man wants to feel the pangs of  Hell let him have the Priesthood &amp; let him have immortal glory, eternal life, Thrones power domin- ions, exhaltations with all the blessings of Abraham,  Isaac &amp; Jacob in view, then let him break the  law of God &amp; defile his Priesthood and in a moment  he falls from his high esstate and all of his exhalted  hopes vanish in a moment &amp; when his eyes are open  to see things as they are he sinks in darkness &amp; wo &amp; the vary sight of the blessings which he has lost causes  a hotter Hell through his soul than fire and brimestone  many other remarks were made by the speaker after which  Br England  made some vary appropriate remarks after which the meeting closed   ENDENTRY February 14, 1848       ENDENTRY February 15, 1848       ENDENTRY February 16, 1848       ENDENTRY February 17, 1848    water mill I spent the day untill 12 oclok at night with Br Davis grinding in the mill Mrs Woodruff spent the time with Sister Davis &amp; we went home in the night    ENDENTRY February 18, 1848    rnacle Br O. Pratt was expected to be  there, O Pratt was there but the others were at Br  Hydes as he had just returned from the east. we also recieved a large mail to day from various parts of the earth several stars from Liverpool showing the rapid progress ot our cause through Scotland and  Wales and of the hard warfare of our worthy friend  Capt Dan Jones it seems as though nearly all Wales was against him yet he is baptizing daily as he is travl- ing through the nation we also got news of the Mexican War, American Congress, the loss of life on the lakes &amp; rivers &amp;c    ENDENTRY February 19, 1848    morning who has been sick near two months I spent most of the day in reading Br Johnathan containing the life of Gen Z Taylor History of the Mexican War and plates of the several Battles in Mexico &amp;c    ENDENTRY February 20, 1848    I went with Mrs P. Richards &amp; herd two letters read from his Sons in England which were interesting, we then called upon Young came in sat a few moments and I went home with him &amp; spent an hour or two and read some late papers    ENDENTRY February 21, 1848       ENDENTRY February 22, 1848    been here for one year &amp; a half I look him up &amp; brought him home with me he attended meeting with me in the evening and  spent the night with me. He took his cloths which Br Smoot left with us for him    ENDENTRY February 23, 1848    ident Young came in we went into the office &amp; attended  to some Business. Br Brown came in &amp; requested one of us to go &amp; preach the funeral sermon of his daughter who was dead. Presidents Brigham &amp; Joseph Young &amp; myself went to his house, we found not ownly his daughter dead  but a number sick in the house. The meeting opened by singing &amp; prayer by Joseph Young, after which President B. Young arose addressed the meeting &amp; said that he had a few rem- arks to make &amp; desired that he might have the Holy spirit while he spoke. Said it was better to go to the House of mourning than to the House  of feasting for that was the end of the living &amp; would force  upon our minds the truth of the desolution which we must all pass through   ENDENTRY  they die in the Lord they are better off than the living for they have gained one victory which the living have not they are  beyound the reach of pain, sorrow, wicked men, devils, and devlish spirits which we are not, for we are daily in the midst of all the suffering that mortal man is heir to &amp;  when will this suffering end, when we die &amp; not before, unless we should live untill Satan is bound but all must pass through death. Yet I would be glad to live to assist in binding Satan as to the Saints we are being worn out according to the wor persecuted in such a manner that there are but few constit- utions among us except such as are broaken to peaces &amp; ready to fall into the grave &amp; we are burying up the Saints vary fast whareever we go over four hundred are laid  in the grave in this place &amp; many in all places whare we have stoped, but all of this pain, sorrow, death &amp; affliction will work to gether for the good of the Saints for these  things must needs be in order to work out the purposes of the Almighty &amp; give the Saints there exhaltation and Glory in the Eternal World. the sectarian wourld with the knowledge they have would if it was in their power sweep the fall  of man, death, pain, sorrow &amp; afflictions with all their attendant evils into oblivion &amp; caused man to have lived eternally as he was before the fall that he might never  have seen death, but such a course would in the end have been the greatest curse that could have been heaped upon man for by so doing it would entirely have frustrated the design of the Almighty in the Creation of man &amp; blocked up the way for his exhaltation glory &amp; greatness &amp; the Lord understood  the subject so well before either the world or man was formed that a Saviour was provided in the Lamb slain from before the foundation of the world to redeem man from Eternal dead so that by man paying the deabt of the fall by passing through the temporal death, they recieve the power &amp; glory of the resurrection by Jesus Christ which gives them an Immortal body which will recieve a far greater glory and power than the mortal body ever could have obtained unto had it not have been for the fall. And I suppose If I had power  the limited Knowledge I have I should sweep from the midst of this people sickness, pain, sorrow, poverty &amp; persecution &amp; mobings I dont suppose I should ever have suffered this people to have been driven at all by a mob but as the Lord knows so much  more than we do He has suffered it so to be &amp; it is for a wise purpose in God, it is for our good &amp; will finally prove for our exhaltation &amp; glory in the eternal world, &amp; gives us experi ence in this life which we otherwise should not have had. "Adam  fell that men might be, men are that they may have Joy, but if they knew no Joy they would have no sorrow, and if they did not know misery they would not know happiness" for man must  experience one in order to comprehend &amp; know the other  had to descend below all things in order to ascend above all things, I am fully convinced that all our sorrows &amp; troubles will work out for us a far more exeeding &amp; eternal wait of glory, hence we ought nought to murmer or complain at our fate. It is true we mourn at the loss of friends but not as those with out hope   ENDENTRY  the spirit for they rest from their labours (&amp; if their friends are faithful) their works will follow them, but what is the time of our suffering in this life in comparison with Eternity After we have spent millions of ages in Eternity &amp; we look back upon our time here &amp; it will ownly look like the twinkling of an eye in comparison and so it will be in the waiting for the resurrection of our bodies it will be for a moment as it were before we shall stand in our immortal bodies but no person can have power to raise the dead except he holds the  the Keys of the resurrection or be ordained unto that power untill he has died &amp; been raised from the dead himself no more than than a man has power to baptize a man legally &amp; lay hands upon him for the Holy Ghost &amp; ordain him to the office of an Elder who has not been baptized or ordained  himself. Adam) holds the Keys of the resurrection and after a man is raised from the dead has  an immortal body &amp; recieves an ordination to hold the Keys of the resurrection from under the Hands of Michael or those having authority he then has power to raise the dead &amp; not  before. Jesus was the first fruits of the Resurrection "He had power to lay down his life &amp; power to take it again," ##John 10:18## when He  had lain in the grave three days an Angel, some person who  was appointed to this work appeared rolled back the stone &amp; called Jesus forth. We have power here through the Priesthood to lay hands upon the sick &amp; they recover, to cast out devils open the eyes of the blind &amp; unstop the ears of the deef according to the faith of the chil- dren of men. It is just as easy to raise the dead for one who is ordained unto this power as it is for us to administer in the ordinances of the House of the Lord here. Some times we lay hands upon the sick &amp; they are healed instantly other times with all the faith &amp; medicine they are a long time getting well, &amp; others die. The spirit of devils who are deprived of having tabernacles are constantly making war with men who have tabernacles &amp; they strive to take up their abode in the tabernacles of men because they have none of their own, &amp; where they can get a chance they will many of them croud into one man &amp; try to reign there &amp; some times they will kill the body &amp; then  the spirit of the man &amp; devils all have to leave it some times in  sickness &amp; weakness the spirit of deavels get possession of the body whare the spirit of man is pure &amp; overcomes it but the moment the spirit leaves the body it is beyound the power &amp; reach of the devils, some children are killed in this way for the devil is making war with every thing that has a tabernacle esspecially the Saints, &amp; the devil rules a great deal in the hearts of the children of men, and if he cannot go in any other way  he will go into a barrel of whiskey &amp; run down their throats and when the saints get into the valley away from the  gentiles the deavel will get into the Half mormons Hickery mormons &amp; will plead with them to get into them but when  we consider how little time we have to spend in this life in comparison to Eternity we ought not to consider it a hard matter to be faithful to God &amp; keep his commandments for when we obtain Celestial glory we shall have to exclaim that it is through the grace of God after all, for the glory far exceeds our sufferings  in this life.
