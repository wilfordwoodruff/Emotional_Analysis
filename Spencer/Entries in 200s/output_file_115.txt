M. Bernhisel    ENDENTRY May 4, 1854 ~ Thursday   3rd 4th JOURNEY May 3rd Presidents Kimbal Kimball with a company Left the Salt Lake City to visit all  the southern settlements I left with them I had  Sprague as my companions I drove to Bishop Smoots at the sugar works then stoped untill Brother Angel could lay out a part of the sugar works Mrs Woodruff and child rode  down there with me I parted with them at this place and drove to Union ward and spent the night Silas Richards is Bishop distance 12 mile   We held a meeting in the evening. President Young Addressed the People I was not in at the commencement  and had no chance of reporting his discourse the following  is a key to his address which I have to write from memory   I do not wish to spend my time neither is it profitably for any man to spend his time in telling the people what was done in the days of Adam, Enoch and Noah thousands of years ago or what will be done in the malinum thousands of years hence but my business is to tell the people what they should do to day in order to be saved this is my doctrin all the time. What can I do or this people do this day in any one thing in order to help build up the kingdom of God or to advance one step further towards ^the^ salvation of ourselves or our brethren. Now what has been the counsel to this people  throughout this Territory for several years it has been to Fort up, to wall in your cities with strong walls, this has been the voice of the Lord unto them all the day long have the people listened to this voice have they carried out this counsel No they have not but what have they done. they have been ready to say what need hath the Lord of this thing, do you think there is any danger of the Indians. do you think that Brother Brigham really believes that it is necessary to go to so much expens in building walls around our cities. Instead of going to work and doing what they are  told to do the people spend their time in talking about it and trying to evade it.   Now I wish to ask a question. The Lord has appointed  me to lead this people the people has chosen me as their leader and covenanted to sustain me and obey my counsel Now if I tell the people what to do and they do not do it nor carry out my counsel, but turn from it and go to work and do sumthing els and they continue this  year after year while at the same time I am warning them of the danger of their Course   ENDENTRY and telling them of the Judgments that will  come upon them if they do not alter their  cours and go to work and do as I have told told them  do you suppose they will escape the chastening  rod of the Almighty No they will not if the  people continue to persue this course and the  chastening rod does not fall upon their heads  I should become disgraced in the sight of God  Angels and men. this people may rest assured that they are preparing a rod for their backs if they do not listen to my counsel and do what I tell them. but says one I would go to work and help build a wall around the City if I knew  it was a revelation from God and that it was  his will that we should do it. I want to say to  such that it is my will that you should do it and that is enough I am responsible for it and if you want to know any further about it do right pray unto the Lord and have faith before him that you may have visions and revelations  from God tso that you may understand the  truth and know what lies before us as I do, then you will not question the reasonableness of these things but go to work and do them with all your might My teaching is to tell the people what to do to be saved to day for if you get out of the path of salvation today you are in danger of being out of it tomorrow and  the further you stray from it the more difficulty you will meet with in ever finding it again. it would  be folly in me to spend my time in telling the people about the glories of the Millennium while I see them  straying from those paths that would lead to those glories now many of this people will say I have fine farms, Horses, Cattle goods gold and riches the possesser says I look upon them I say thes are mine and at the same time you do not once even think  that there is not one thing in your possession that is youres that it all belongs to God and even you yourself belongs to God and all you have belongs to Him and He has ownly loaned it to you and yet  you do not acknowlede his hand in any thing while you should acknowledge his hand in all things.   I know what the design  of the Lord is in leading this people to this place and his design  concerning Israel and it is none of your business what I coun- sel you to do it is your business to go to work and do it. leave the event with God I want this people to build their forts as I  tell them and when you have built this fort and made a wall 6 feet thick and 12 feet high and get comfortable in your houses then  go to work and build one on the outside of it 12 feet thick and run them both up together 25 feet high and keep building untill  I tell you to stop. and be in a situation that you may shut up  your gates and lie down and sleep in safety with your wives and children many other interesting remarks were made by President Young upon this occasion which I am not able to record   ENDENTRY May 5, 1854 ~ Friday   May 5th Friday we left Union fort rode to dry creek settlement made a short halt then drove to the American fork. 25 miles and spent the night the ^people^ Assembled for a meeting I was called upon to address the people the following is a key to the remarks which I made. I said to the people that I should confine my remarks to those things that immediately consern us you have been counselled to build forths and wall in your cities with strong  walls for several years throughout this Territory but the people have not done it they have vary slow to harken to the  counsel of the servants of God from the begining even in the days of Joseph all the people were ready to acknowledge  he was a profit and looked to him to receive salvations at his hands and was ready to have him controll them in all matters appertaining to what the people termed spiritual things but if He wanted $100 dollars in money He would have  to Employ all the Twelve and mortgage his farm in order to get it the traditions of the people were so strong that they  could not bear the Idea of having a Prophet dictate their tem- poral affairs but I wish to ask a question which is the most important to you A part in the first resurrection in  exaltation and glory in the Celestial Kingdom of God with all its attendant blessings or a few Horses Cattle gold and goods Judge ye then why should it be thought a thing incredible or unjst unjust for a profit of God who is called to guide and controll us in all the weighty matters that consern us should also counsel us  in those lesser matters of every day life now go to and build your wall around your city as you have been commanded to do  and the blessings of God will rest upon you but if you refuse  to follow the counsel given there is a rod preparing for you  and it will be but a short time before you will see the hand of God visible in the counsel that has been given to this people in building strong walls around these Cities many other remarks was made but not here recorded   President Kimball followed and said that what Brother Woodruff had said was true his words are true. President  Young comes here to visit the people and tell them what He wants done He has sent men to you also to tell you what to do and that  is the same as though he had been with you himself you have got to follow his counsel. And you have to fulfill your covenants  which you made at the waters of Baptism we must not forget  God. He intends we shall do that which we ought to do when God tels us to do any thing we should go to work and do it willingly I am telling what is our duty. many often want to Jump over under officers so as to get to President Young I have lived in the days of Joseph and in the days of President Young and I  have always obayed those men for they were placed over me to obey them it is the duty of this people to obey their lead- ers it is the duty of my family to obey me I have no misteries to give you for I have none but my business is to teach you the truth well you are told to make a wall around your City and you have it to do. you read in the Book of mormon that the people had to wall in their cities in ancient days we have it  to do in our day you have to become one or you are not the Lords   ENDENTRY you are a good people but their is great room for imp- rovement in this city. the last one that we visited. I would like to see this people in good houses and gardens  and in good forts.   now when you come to the conference  you all vote to sustain President Young now you have got  to honour this man he holds the FIGURE of the Kingdom of God  and sustain him or the Lord will not save and exhalt you in his kingdom. I pray that you may do right and serve  the Lord I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ Amen   President Young arose and said I am willing to say a few words. If the Latter Day Saints cannot become one hart and  mind and work in their temporal things which they do understand they cannot become one in Eternal things which they cannot understand. If you would too do as you are told then  all would be right when the Lord requires any thing  at your hands dont ask any questions but go to and do as you are counselled to do you may ask is their any danger of the Indians you do not always know what danger you are in but always do as you are told and then you are  safe    ENDENTRY May 6, 1854 ~ Saturday   Saturday 6th Rode to ^provo 12 mils spent the Sabbath and held a meeting with the people Sunda President Young arose and said that I am  not in the habit of taking a text but I will now take for my text the last line that was sung "God is his  own interpetor" He will make all things plain but do the people understand those things which are for our good the Lord will not explain all things unto us whe under stands but he will make his people walk by faith He  will not explain all his mistaries to the people. we read in the  New Testament that faith is the assurance of things hoped  for and the evidence of things not seen have we all got  faith it is our duty to have faith in God and his word and promises you have to trust in God. He will not reveal all things unto  us some men are tried will the counsel given and will  not obey they will not have glory in the kingdom of God they are bastards and not sons the Lord intends for the people to be tried so as to prove the faithful What God does reveal He reveals for the purpose of leading men in the way of salvation the people do not know the way of the Lord they come here and say I am going to build myself up I have to work so hard I cannot get time to pray but are you doing right when  you do this we may labour to get all things abot us yet the Lord will controll it as seemath him good. If you get into the dark still hold on to the work of God no matter if I dont fell like praying I will do it if the Lord should open the visions of the minds of the people that have gone  to Calafornia so that they could see things as they are they would as soon cut their throats as to have done it but they  dont see it they have to go and suffer untill they are satisfied I will say the same to this people if we do not   ENDENTRY do the things which god requires of us we shall be whiped till we  are sore this is the ownly thing that will save us I now tell you that those that are gone and going to Calafornia without counsel will ketch it till they are sore I know the truth but I cann- ot tell it all to you untill God permits me to do it now if you have not confidence in me to follow me and believe that I am doing right  drop me and appoint another and I will follow in the wake.   In the begining of this work God tried to get this people to be one but they would not be one. I will now tell you what to do God intends to make you one you must be one and their must be a  begining to this and you must begin in small things like children making Cob Houses the people went to Missouri and there they  quarrelled about many small matters then God said I will throw  down their good houses and God d^D^roved all the people out and they thought they were knocked into pieces ink change did they do any better then, no they did not, God tries the people both in riches and with poverty. if I will be faithful in my poverty I will own all riches that is needful. now if God wants us to be of one heart and one mind. now he may have no ^other^ motive in view than to make us work together he will tell us to build fences and forts that our feelings and interest may be united in something. now will you do it? we are required to become of one heart and mind and work together in those little things that we do understand or else we could not be prepared to work together and be one in those eternal things which we do not understand therefore we could not enter into the kingdom of God. it is nothing but the power of God that has preserved this settlement. the Indians could have killed every man woman and child here, and not a man had a gun ready to defend himself. when you have become of one heart and mind he has treasures for you and has given us capacity to see if we will magnify our calling with every thing we have to do in our lives. we are approaching very swiftly the time when Jesus will come to see if we are of one heart and mind which the Prophet Joseph said would be in this generation and will manifest himself to the Saints and take up his abode with him. this was said 24 years ago and in 26 years more if we r not prepared to meet Jesus and angels we shall be wiped out and sent to hell. we r fast approaching the time I do not care what was done in the morning of creation or the days of Noah. I want to know what this people will do. will you be Saints and live your religion and magnify your callings in the Church I will now tell this people what they should do. I will tell the Bishop in the presence of the people what to do. Bishop I tell you, go and start this wall and build it 6 feet thick and 12 or 14 feet high shut up every gate except two and then you can lay down in safety and an enemy cannot come upon you. if this is not the will of the Lord I do know it is my will and you should not question any  further. God wants it done and I want it done and dont stop until you are secured and that is enough your stacks have been so placed that one Indian could fire all this place and others shoot you down while you are fighting the fire. what if the people in Jackson Co had been good and been sanctified  what would have been the situation of the people. why, the liars and goats would have had their heads cut off but the wheat and tares had to be transplanted together in the wilderness. it was not the act  of Joseph that caused the removal of this people. it is the people that govern and control which is the democracy of heaven. the democracy of earth is division and mark it, there will be a division here before long among this people. now if you will all do right and live a holy life angels will come and visit us and stay with us all night and you will have many revelations and be happy. we know we ought to pray and would not neglect it, if we loved the Lord. you may do just as you have a mind to when I am gone but I beg and beseech of you to do right. I want you to build a strong wall and be  safe so that whatever comes along you may be secure and bar your gates and be careful and dont let the devil reign in you and all will be right and God bless you and I bless you. let us be ^of^ one heart and mind in the things that we do comprehend and then we shall be one in things we shall hereafter know.   President H C Kimball it is not my place ink change to get up to reveal any thing for it is the head to convey it to the body. but it is for me to carry out his designs and do his will for when I do the will of  President Young I do the will of God and no man can get salvation unless he keeps his council   it is his will that the City should be walled and fortified and that is my will, when I do just   ENDENTRY as he tells me I do the will of my Father in Heaven for he is the only man that holds the keys of salvation. when I feel reluctant to do his will I feel bad and so do you all. when I do his will I can sleep in peace and my heart is consoled all the day long. this is also the case with you when you do not do as your Bishop tells you. last year your improvements were all scattered about but now you are got into a smashed suckertash pie. now go to and save yourselves against all selfishness. I am going to put my property and all my wives into the Church and then nothing can be taken out of the Church. I am going to dedicate all  I have to God. when a man turns away from the Priesthood he forfeits every thing even his life for that is no longer his. my body is only lent to me by the Lord  and I forfeit every thing when I go astray. if righteousness was laid to the line  it would take many heads from their shoulders and the day will be when that will be done   ink change now do as your bishop tells you and not go to salt  Lake to President Young to alter this or that I pray that this people may do right for when you dishonor the priesthood you dishonor God I have been told  that some have said that I will honor the priesthood  but I will not honor him that holds the priesthood but I say that you cannot honor one without honoring the other. Bishop Walker is presiding here follow his council and all will be right and the blessing of  God will rest upon you even so Amen   Benediction by W Woodruff   we rode to Provo and spent the night    ENDENTRY May 7, 1854 ~ Sunday   Sunday May 7th The people assembled in the meeting house in two rooms.

ENDENTRY May 11, 1854 ~ Thursday   ^FIGURE^ Thursday 11th we rode to Chicken Creek and stoped and spent the night near Walker and his band. we had an interview with Walker. President Young and counsel tried to have a talk with him at first Walker appeared dogish and was not disposed to talk when we first formed our carrell within 40 rods of his camp, He gatherd all his warriors and made quite a display but we did not go out to meet them at the  time they turned their horses out and went into their  tents. And when we called upon Walker He lay down  in the dirt and did not feel disposed to talk but BPresident  Young manifested great patience with him even after the patience of most men was exhausted. He went to him and lifted him out of the dirt and finally got him to talk some the following is a synopsis of the conversation   Walker said he had no spirit He had no heart did not feel as though He could talk. And when I herd that President Young was coming I felt that I had no heart I do not  want to talk I want to hear President Young talk and he sit still and here others talk. President Young gave him some tobaco he said when he had plenty of tobaco then all his  friends would come in and smoke with him but when He was out of tobaco Gov Young said I have brought soome  beef cattle for you I want one killed so you kan have  a feast while we are here He wanted to have the mormons sing before the parties take a smoke. He said E T Benson come and his heart was good but D Huntington came and his heart was running. we then sung. He then spoke and said I have not got  the spirit of the Lord and if their is any one here that kan give me the spirit of the Lord I wish they would do it. He said white people in heaven was happy   Tulpidge next spoke amid much crying and tears he is the one that had his wife killed c He said that I (D Huntington)  had been good to him and he had not seen me since his child died. He said they now had got good hearts and the mormons hearts was now good that wer here we have now good peasce and can all lie down in peace without fear And I want to live in friendship with this people.   we left  the Indian camp and returned to our waggons President Young had another talk with walker and T Bullock reported I was not present.    ENDENTRY May 12, 1854 ~ Friday   Friday 12 we again visited Walker at his tent this mor ning. He was still in the same unpleasant mood did not wish  to talk and left his tent and went into the willows   ENDENTRY and others talked they had a sick child and they wished the Elders to lay hands upon it. then President Benson and Sprague left some med- icine for it and for several others that was sick the Indian  said if the child died He would have to kill an Indian child or a mormon child to go with it (as this is their tradition the interperter told him he must not do it that it was wrong that when Mormon children died we did not kill any child  to go with them and they must not do it for it was not right the Indian said his heart was not so he wanted to kill some one to go with him. He said He wanted his child to get well and then He would go with us but do not wants to go till his child gets well. He said Walker was a great chief and President  Young was a great chief and what he said was true that he could not say any thing wrong. Petetnet spoke and said  that that would be good and not steal nor kill any body that one could now go alone and not be killed their would  be no blood in their path. Walker wished President  Young to write a Letter so he could show it to the people  and let them know that we were at peace so their would  be no difficulty with the people. President Young wrote one Dr Sprague gave medicine to the sick child and gave  Walker directions how to deal with the child and 10 others  which Dr Sprague had left medicine for 2 of which was vary sick they all got well. (Sister Lorenzo Young allso was quite sick with the Lung complaint Dr Sprague gave  medicine to her she got well and several others in the camp was under his care) On parting with Walker at his tent He said we now understand each other that they were now to have all pease so all could now go on the road in peace  and not be afraid could now put in wheat and corn and one alone without for somebody to kill them He now wanted to have the road clear without any blood in it. He wished for peace all the time both shook together then all the company shook hands and the pipe of peace was smoked. Walker received his presents and killed a beef for the Indians to have a feast they also treaded swaped blankets for Horses and bought 2 children that were prisoners.

He spoke as He always  does much to the edifycation of the People    ENDENTRY January 2, 1854 ~ Monday   2nd ^FIGURE^ I delivered an address to the inhabitants of the 14th ward ^at the^ school House was followed by several others  in the fore part of the day I attended a party in  the evening at the Social Hall time was mostly spent in music and danceing we had However an interesting address from President Young on the subject of danceing He said I consider this a suitable place to give some instruction.   we have assembled here to have music and danceing the world have had vary strange Ideas concerning these things they have supposed it was a vary wicked thing for a Christian to dance or hear music many preachers of the day have said that fidling and music hCame from Hell But I say that their is no fiddleing or music in hell their is not a fiddler in hell or any music of any kind music belongs in heaven to cheer God, Angel, and man, if we could hear the music  their is in heaven it would overwhelm mortal man the Lord gave us that organ that makes music so delightful to man and the Devel has stolen musick and many other things that was ordained of God for the Benefit of man and has turned it to an evil use but music and danceing is for the benefit of the Holy ones and if those that come here to night are not Holy and righteous and feel to worship and Praise God they  have no business here what strange Idea the world has of a prophet they would expect to see a man with finger na^i^les a foot long with his hair hanging to his hips, with his body covered with dirt and filth with his head bowed down in sorrow for the sins of the world that He would not  have a house or lie in one, or in a bed, but lie in the caves of the rocks and on the Ground and must never smile or appear happy. And as to seeing an Apostles the people would  expect to melt if one came along. But all of these Ideas are vain and foolish for this company before me to night does not begin to be adorned inside or out as they should be in order to meet with the Angels in heaven who are adorned in purity power and Glory clothed with clean white linen. I will say a word concerning danceing with the Gentiles. As I have got up this party If I had felt disposed to have invited some Gentiles here would they have contaminated me or this company No because the priesthood rules here with the keys of power truth light and knowledge. And I would not suffer any thing that is rong for I would controlls things and have them my  own way or break up the party. But if any Elder in this church was to follow after Gentile parties they would submit themselves to their spirit partake of their evils and go to the devel any Elder would fall that persued this course   ENDENTRY why do not the Gentile merchants of this City embraced this work because they have locked boarded and bolted their minds against it with evry lock they could put on.

We spent a plesant evening before they left sister Whitney sung in tongues in the pure language which garden of Eden this gift was obtained while in Kirtland through the promise of Joseph He told her if she would rise upon her feet (while in a meeting) she should have the pure Language she done so and immediately commenced singing in that language. it was as near heavenly music as any thing I ever herd.    ENDENTRY February 4, 1854 ~ Saturday   4th I spent the day in school with my children    ENDENTRY February 5, 1854 ~ Sunday   5 Sunday Brothers Benson Preached to the people in the forenoon and President Brigham Young in the afternoon FIGURE and it was a choice feast one of the best sermons ever deliverd to the people it was rich in principles and Godliness the hearts of the people were feasted and all rejoiced. At the close of the meeting I attended the prayer circle then I went  to the 9th ward and preached and    ENDENTRY February 6, 1854 ~ Monday   6th I attended meeting with the perpetual fund company Adjurned till 1st monday in march I took out of the Library the 1st vol of Benjamin Franklin by J Spenby which consisted of 10 vol I red the first vol through which I found Highly instructing and interesting the following is an extract of his rules of perfection which He endeavored to carry out in his Life   ENDENTRY The names of virtues with their precepts were   1st Temperance—Eat not to dulness; drink not to elevation   2nd Silence—Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself avoid trifling conversation   3rd Order—Let all your things have their places. let each part of your business have its time   4th Resolution—Resolve to perform what you ought perform without fail what you resolve   5 Frugality—Make no expens but to do good to others or yourself that is waste nothing   6th Industry—Lose no time be always employed in somthing useful cut off all unnecessary action   7th Sincerity—Use no hurtful deceit think innocently and justly And if you speak speak accordingly   8th Justice—wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your duty   9th Moderation—Avoid extremes forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve   10 Cleanliness—Tolerate no uncleanliness in boby, clothes or habitation   11th Tranquility—Be not disturbed at trifles or at accidents common or unavoidable   12 Chastity . . . . .   13 Humility—Imitate Jesus and Socrates   Says Franklin: My intention being to acquire the habit of all these virtues I judged it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once but to fit it on one of them at a time and when I should be master of that, then to procede to another, and so on till I should have gone through the 13. And as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others I aranged them with this view as they stand above. Temperance first as it tends to procure that cooleness and clearness of head  which is so necessary whare constant vigilance was to be up and a guard maintained against the unremiting attraction of ancient habits and the force of perpetual temptations.   This being acquired and esstablished. Silence would be more easy and my desire begiing to gain knowledge at the same time that I improved in virtue and considering that in conver- sation it was obtained rather by the use of the ear than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I was getting unto of prattling, punning, and jesting which ownly made me acceptable to trifling company. I gave silence the second place this and the next order I expected would allow me more time for attending to my project and my  studies. Resolution once become habitual would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all the subsequent virtues Frugality and industry releiving me from my remaining debt and producing affluence and independance would make more   ENDENTRY easy the practice of sincerity and Justice andc andc   conceiving then that agreeable to the advice of  Pythagoras in the golden verses daily examination  would be nessary, I contrived the following method for conducting that examination. I made a little Book in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues I  ruled each page with red ink so as to have seven columns One for each day of the week, marking each column with a letter for the day I crossed these columns with 13 red lines marking the begining of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues on which line on which  line and in its proper column I might mark by a little black spot every fault I found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day   Form of the Pages   TEMPERANCE Eat not to dulness, drink not to elevation   Sun M. T W Th F S   Tem Sil **** Ord ***** Res ** Fru ** Ind * Sinc Jus Mod Clea Tran Chas Hum   I determined to give a weeks strict attention to each of the virtues successively. thus in the first week I could my great guard was to avoid even the least offence against temperance leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance ownly marking evry evening the faults of the day.   ENDENTRY Thus ^if^ in the first ^week^ I could keep my first line marked T clear of spots I supposed the habit of that virtue so much strengthend and its opposite weakened that I might venture extending my attention to include the next and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots proceding thus to the last I could get through a course complete in 13 weeks and four courses in a year. And like him who having a garden to weed does not attempt to eradicate all the bad barbs at once which wood exced his reach and his strength but works on one of the beds at a time and having acco- mplished the first proceds to a second so I should have I hoped the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress made in virtue by clearing success- fully my lines of their spots till in the end by a num- ber of courses I should be happy in viewing a clean Book after a thirteen weeks daily examination   This my little Book had for its motto these lines from Addisons Cato   Here will I hold if there's a power above us And that there is all nature cries aloud Through all her works He must delight in virtue And that which he delights in must be happy   Thus I have copied so much out of the life of Franklin think- ing it an excellent and worthy example, and hoping it may do me or my children or some other persons some good. Another principle of Dr Franklins life and recommendation is vary good under many circumstances in life He recom mends to all persons in the pulpit, at the bar, in debate, in conversation to take the modarate ground in Phrase- ology to say I think or apprehend, I believe or I am of the opinion that things are thus and so. And not that I know, I declare, I affirm, that things are thus and so    ENDENTRY February 7, 1854  ~ Tuesday   7th I spent the day at home with my children    ENDENTRY February 8, 1854 ~ Wednesday to  ENDENTRY February 11, 1854  ~ Saturday   8 9 10 and 11 I spent the time in school with my children I attended meeting in the 14 ward with the children on the 8th and had a good time we are now holding meet- ings in the different wards through the city with FIGURE the children we get all the children over 8 yards years of age together and learn them to pray and speak of the things of God and it is having a good influence their is a great responsibility resting upon the parents towards their children    ENDENTRY February 12, 1854 ~ Sunday   12 Sunday John Taylor addressed the saints in the forenoon And President Young in the afternoon He delivered one of the most interesting discourses ever delivered to the people I did not report eit but others did and it will be printed    ENDENTRY February 13, 1854 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY February 14, 1854 ~ Tuesday   13th 14th I spent the time with my children in school   ENDENTRY February 15, 1854 ~ Wednesday   Feb 15th I spent the time in school at attended the children meeting in the evening near one hundred were present and prayed and spoke and sung    ENDENTRY February 16, 1854 ~ Thursday   16th I spent the time at home during the day in school and the evening with the children of the 19th ward    ENDENTRY February 17, 1854 ~ Friday to  ENDENTRY February 18, 1854 ~ Saturday   17th and 18 I spent the time trying to settle accounts    ENDENTRY February 19, 1854 ~ Sunday   19 FIGURE Sunday E.

While the  remarks were being made the times which I had spent with Brother Richards in a foreign country came to my  mind and I felt solumn and lonesome under it. After the burial I called upon the family and conversed with them I Attended the prayer meeting with the Twelve and then with with Brother Kimball and Franklin Richards to Dr Richards House and spent the evening with the family and Brother Kimball  conversed with them till 9 oclock and gave them much counsel the following are some of the sentiments and council given   ENDENTRY He said that He believed that the saints on the other side of the veil in the spirit world are gathered together the same as they are in this life while the world are scattered over the earth after death the same as they are now and in the same confusion and that their would  be head quarters of the gathering whare they would send out messengers to preach the gospel to the spirits in prision.

I want you to wake up yourselves and then wake up your wives and Children and stop your lying  and stealing and take that Burthen upon your Backs which belong to you then the Presidency and Twelve will ownly carry their own burthens. The time has come or is near at hand when many that have trifled with the priesthood and the things of God will be destroyed and go to Hell cross lots and those who are not faithful in magnifying the priesthood it will be taken from them and given to others and that quickly and I know it for Angels, Prophets, and Holy men say it and it will be fulfilled.   As to danceing I am tiered of it I never want to see another man dance untill he can do it by the power of God. I felt that spirit once and Brother Brigham shouted Hosanna for we was both filled with the spirit Neither do I want to see any more feasting  at present. I dont want to see any more Jealous feelings some of our Bishops get Jealous of the servants of God no man would be if He was filled with the Holy Ghost. I would chastize a man if He stood in  my way when I knew that I am a messenger sent of God. President  Young says if the people do not do right He will not stay long with them but shall go the other side of the veil if He goes I shall not stay long behind him because we will not have one between us  and if you dont do your duty we shall go soon I have had many men try to stand between me and president Young and when I have been to see him many have snubed me but I have seen enough of  this. And that man that will try to do it He must look out  for God and his angels will smite him. I have no objection to men  coming to President Young to comfort him and do him good and when he gives them a wife give him $10 or $20 dollars according as He may value his wife. But men must not try to separate us if they  do they will be cursed I understood that Brother Woodruff got  a whiping from one of them lately But I tell you that although He is a small man He is all gold and you will find it so in the end and you may be thankful to ever get as good a place as He will get  for he is the pure gold and I wish you would get as good as He is the Bishops will not repeat what the missionaries say for they are Jealous. But if you will get the spirit of God upon you there  will be no Jealous feelings in your heart. you want the spirit  of God and the power of the priesthood to rest upon you as it did  upon Joseph and does upon the Presidency and Twelve. take that priesthood upon you which belongs to you and magnify it. The Missionaris want to wake up then wake up the Bishops and then wake up the  people and all live your religion and all will go well and if you  will live up to your priviliges here and get the spirit of this refermation  it will reach all over the Earth and go to the ends of the Earth and the wicked  will not have power over us but this work will go from Zion through all the world as the sap of a tree will go from the trunk to the end of evry  limb and twig. I want to see the power of God among this people that  they may have faith to remove mountains if necessary but the power  of God will ownly increase as the spirit of God increases among the people if we will do our duty ^and^ if the United States should be the aggressers the Lord  would say if they came against us Let my servant Brigham send 200  men and they would lick them up, for God would assist to fight our Battles with the storm hail and snow, and they would be destroyed. I know this would be done but we must get the faith of the Ancients   ENDENTRY As to Brother I have to say that He is just as good a man as ever was on Earth. Now wake up Brethren and see that you purify yourselves before you try to purify others then go forth and lift up your voice like a trumpet and call upon all men to repent get full of the Holy Ghost and there is not a man that will do it but what will be filled with Prophesyings as were the ancient Nephites, and little Boys 4 years old will prophesiey. I do not wish to go to a feast or a dance until this people reform. and when there is men enough here to bring forth this refermation and men will not prosper untill they do their duty to God and each other. I have no desire to attend any recreation untill this people are filled with the spirit and power of God and I do not think that President Young has. if you will rise up and do your duty you will be blessed and no man that rises up against us in this place will prosper if we do our duty and we wash our feet against them I believe in washing our feet against our Enemies.  The spirit of God  has been upon us for more than a year and the people would play laugh and trifle about it but if they had the spirit of God and done their duty they would have seen it this has been my feelings all the time I have felt that the people were trifling with the things of God. Brother Jedediah is fallen a mighty man is taken from us but his power is here it still rests upon Brother Brigham and myself and when we lay hands upon ^another^ m man the spirit  of God and of Jedediah will rest upon him in full force that he may do the work and fill his place as a counciller to the president and I know it May God  Bless you Amen   Elder R L Campbell took minutes He was followed by D.
