 Brigham Young's Big Family.As a physiological fact, of the fifty-sixchildren born to Brigham Young not one washalt, lame or blind, all being perfect in bodyand of sound mind and intellect; no defectsof mind or body save those general onesshared by humanity. The boys are a sound,healthy, industrious, and intelligent groupof men, noted everywhere for their integrityand for the excellent care and at-tention bestowed upon their families.In short, the name Young is a synonym of agood, kind, faithful husband. Among themare lawyers, merchants, a railroad king, abanker, an architect, a civil engineer and amanufacturer. One of them is a colonel inthe United States army, while several havegraduated from the Annapolis naval schooland from the Ann Arbor law school. Thegirls are finely developed physically, quickand bright in intellect, high-spirited andoften talented, especially in a musical way.A few of them were beautiful girls, and arestill handsome women. All are nice girls,kind in disposition, generous and social  intheir natures. In short, outside of one ortwo of either sex, they are a family that anyman might well be proud to call his own.This is given by way of argument, notboasting. —Susa Young Gates in North Ameri-can Review for March.

 W Woodruff we are blest as a people in having life & death set before us—every thing that leads to do evil is from the Devil& that will deprive him of our exaltation—it is really unpopular in the world to worship God in truth & a person is forbiddento pray before Senators & officers except in a popular manner—& the general disposition is to cheat or abuse his neighbor& thus they receive all the effects of Sin & Death—& shew forth a dividing line between them, & the people who receive truth & lighthence the ordinances of the gospel are very simple—altho 666 different sects profess to show mankind the way to glory & heaventhe LDS. have become a wonder to the world by shewing unity & they preach the same gospel as has been preached in every ageof the world—shewing the figure of a perfect body & by having the truths of eternity they can comprehend the glory of Godwe do not ask the world to mourn for us, but to weep for themselves as they are like the ox going to the slaughter, they knownot the da of their visitation & little think that the judgments of the Almighty ^John Taylor^ are to be poured out upon the nations of the Earthshew me the nation that has rejected the Servants of God & their testimony & I will shew you a nation ripe for the judgments of Godfor when men refuse the light & truth we can not help it—man will worship ^(B. Young)^ any thing in preference to God & will choose deathinstead of life, & exhorted the Emigrants & all persons to obey the first principles of the gospel & prayed for the blessings of the Lordto rest upon all of them—if a person has not the Spirit of God he should pray God to give it to him &c.
