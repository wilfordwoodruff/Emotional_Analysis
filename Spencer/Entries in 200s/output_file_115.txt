May 1, 1854    FIGURE I received 5 Letters 3 from J M Bernhisel  2 from Woodruff 1 from  Ilus       ENDENTRY May 4, 1854    with a company Left the Salt Lake City to visit all  the southern settlements I left with them I had  Sprague as my companions I drove to Bishop Smoots at the sugar works then stoped untill Brother Angel could lay out a part of the sugar works Mrs Woodruff &amp; child rode  down there with me I parted with them at this place &amp; drove to Union ward &amp; spent the night Silas Richards is Bishop distance 12 mile    Addressed the People I was not in at the commencement  &amp; had no chance of reporting his discourse the following  is a key to his address which I have to write from memory    for any man to spend his time in telling the people what was done in the days of Adam, Enoch &amp; Noah thousands of years ago or what will be done in the malinum thousands of years hence but my business is to tell the people what they should do to day in order to be saved this is my doctrin all the time. What can I do or this people do this day in any one thing in order to help build up the kingdom of God or to advance one step further towards ^the^ salvation of ourselves or our brethren. Now what has been the counsel to this people  throughout this Territory for several years it has been to Fort up, to wall in your cities with strong walls, this has been the voice of the Lord unto them all the day long have the people listened to this voice have they carried out this counsel No they have not but what have they done. they have been ready to say what need hath the Lord of this thing, do you think there is any danger of the Indians. do you think that Brother Brigham really believes that it is necessary to go to so much expens in building walls around our cities. Instead of going to work &amp; doing what they are  told to do the people spend their time in talking about it &amp; trying to evade it.    me to lead this people the people has chosen me as their leader &amp; covenanted to sustain me &amp; obey my counsel Now if I tell the people what to do &amp; they do not do it nor carry out my counsel, but turn from it &amp; go to work &amp; do sumthing els &amp; they continue this  year after year while at the same time I am warning them of the danger of their Course   ENDENTRY  come upon them if they do not alter their  cours &amp; go to work &amp; do as I have told told them  do you suppose they will escape the chastening  rod of the Almighty No they will not if the  people continue to persue this course &amp; the  chastening rod does not fall upon their heads  I should become disgraced in the sight of God  Angels &amp; men. this people may rest assured that they are preparing a rod for their backs if they do not listen to my counsel &amp; do what I tell them. but says one I would go to work &amp; help build a wall around the City if I knew  it was a revelation from God &amp; that it was  his will that we should do it. I want to say to  such that it is my will that you should do it &amp; that is enough I am responsible for it &amp; if you want to know any further about it do right pray unto the Lord &amp; have faith before him that you may have visions &amp; revelations  from God  truth &amp; know what lies before us as I do, then you will not question the reasonableness of these things but go to work &amp; do them with all your might My teaching is to tell the people what to do to be saved to day for if you get out of the path of salvation today you are in danger of being out of it tomorrow &amp;  the further you stray from it the more difficulty you will meet with in ever finding it again. it would  be folly in me to spend my time in telling the people about the glories of the Millennium while I see them  straying from those paths that would lead to those glories now many of this people will say I have fine farms, Horses, Cattle goods gold &amp; riches the possesser says I look upon them I say thes are mine &amp; at the same time you do not once even think  that there is not one thing in your possession that is youres that it all belongs to God &amp; even you yourself belongs to God &amp; all you have belongs to Him &amp; He has ownly loaned it to you &amp; yet  you do not acknowlede his hand in any thing while you should acknowledge his hand in all things.    of the Lord is in leading this people to this place &amp; his design  concerning Israel and it is none of your business what I coun- sel you to do it is your business to go to work &amp; do it. leave the event with God I want this people to build their forts as I  tell them &amp; when you have built this fort &amp; made a wall 6 feet thick &amp; 12 feet high &amp; get comfortable in your houses then  go to work &amp; build one on the outside of it 12 feet thick &amp; run them both up together 25 feet high &amp; keep building untill  I tell you to stop. &amp; be in a situation that you may shut up  your gates &amp; lie down &amp; sleep in safety with your wives &amp; children many other interesting remarks were made by President Young upon this occasion which I am not able to record   ENDENTRY May 5, 1854    made a short halt then drove to the American fork. 25 miles &amp; spent the night the ^people^ Assembled for a meeting I was called upon to address the people the following is a key to the remarks which I made. I said to the people that I should confine my remarks to those things that immediately consern us you have been counselled to build fort walls for several years throughout this Territory but the people have not done it they have vary slow to harken to the  counsel of the servants of God from the begining even in the days of Joseph all the people were ready to acknowledge  he was a profit &amp; looked to him to receive salvations at his hands &amp; was ready to have him controll them in all matters appertaining to what the people termed spiritual things but if He wanted $100 dollars in money He would have  to Employ all the Twelve &amp; mortgage his farm in order to get it the traditions of the people were so strong that they  could not bear the Idea of having a Prophet dictate their tem- poral affairs but I wish to ask a question which is the most important to you A part in the first resurrection in  exaltation &amp; glory in the Celestial Kingdom of God with all its attendant blessings or a few Horses Cattle gold &amp; goods Judge ye then why should it be thought a thing incredible or  unjust for a profit of God who is called to guide &amp; controll us in all the weighty matters that consern us should also counsel us  in those lesser matters of every day life now go to &amp; build your wall around your city as you have been commanded to do  &amp; the blessings of God will rest upon you but if you refuse  to follow the counsel given there is a rod preparing for you  &amp; it will be but a short time before you will see the hand of God visible in the counsel that has been given to this people in building strong walls around these Cities many other remarks was made but not here recorded    Woodruff had said was true his words are true. President  Young comes here to visit the people &amp; tell them what He wants done He has sent men to you also to tell you what to do &amp; that  is the same as though he had been with you himself you have got to follow his counsel. And you have to fulfill your covenants  which you made at the waters of Baptism we must not forget  God. He intends we shall do that which we ought to do when God tels us to do any thing we should go to work &amp; do it willingly I am telling what is our duty. many often want to Jump over under officers so as to get to President Young I have lived in the days of Joseph &amp; in the days of President Young &amp; I  have always obayed those men for they were placed over me to obey them it is the duty of this people to obey their lead- ers it is the duty of my family to obey me I have no misteries to give you for I have none but my business is to teach you the truth well you are told to make a wall around your City and you have it to do. you read in the Book of mormon that the people had to wall in their cities in ancient days we have it  to do in our day you have to become one or you are not the Lords   ENDENTRY  rovement in this city. the last one that we visited. I would like to see this people in good houses &amp; gardens  &amp; in good forts.    you all vote to sustain President Young now you have got  to honour this man he holds the FIGURE of the Kingdom of God  and sustain him or the Lord will not save &amp; exhalt you in his kingdom. I pray that you may do right &amp; serve      words. If the Latter Day Saints cannot become one hart &amp;  mind &amp; work in their temporal things which they do understand they cannot become one in Eternal things which they cannot understand. If you would too do as you are told then  all would be right when the Lord requires any thing  at your hands dont ask any questions but go to &amp; do as you are counselled to do you may ask is their any danger of the Indians you do not always know what danger you are in but always do as you are told &amp; then you are  safe    ENDENTRY May 6, 1854      not in the habit of taking a text but I will now take for my text the last line that was sung "God is his  own interpetor" He will make all things plain but do the people understand those things which are for our good the Lord will not explain all things unto us  stands but he will make his people walk by faith He  will not explain all his mistaries to the people. we read in the  New Testament that faith is the assurance of things hoped  for &amp; the evidence of things not seen have we all got  faith it is our duty to have faith in God &amp; his word &amp; promises you have to trust in God. He will not reveal all things unto  us some men are tried will the counsel given &amp; will  not obey they will not have glory in the kingdom of God they are bastards &amp; not sons the Lord intends for the people to be tried so as to prove the faithful What God does reveal He reveals for the purpose of leading men in the way of salvation the people do not know the way of the Lord they come here and say I am going to build myself up I have to work so hard I cannot get time to pray but are you doing right when  you do this we may labour to get all things abot us yet the Lord will controll it as seemath him good. If you get into the dark still hold on to the work of God no matter if I dont fell like praying I will do it if the Lord should open the visions of the minds of the people that have gone  to Calafornia so that they could see things as they are they would as soon cut their throats as to have done it but they  dont see it they have to go and suffer untill they are satisfied I will say the same to this people if we do not   ENDENTRY  are sore this is the ownly thing that will save us I now tell you that those that are gone &amp; going to Calafornia without counsel will ketch it till they are sore I know the truth but I cann- ot tell it all to you untill God permits me to do it now if you have not confidence in me to follow me &amp; believe that I am doing right  drop me and appoint another &amp; I will follow in the wake.    one but they would not be one. I will now tell you what to do God intends to make you one you must be one &amp; their must be a  begining to this and you must begin in small things like children making Cob Houses the people went to Missouri &amp; there they  quarrelled about many small matters then God said I will throw  down their good houses &amp; God  they were knocked into pieces ink change did they do any better then, no they did not, God tries the people both in riches &amp; with poverty. if I will be faithful in my poverty I will own all riches that is needful. now  may have no ^other^ motive in view than to make us work together he will tell us to build fences &amp; forts that our feelings &amp; interest may be united in something. now will you do it? we are required to become of one heart &amp; mind &amp; work together in those little things that we do understand or else we could not be prepared to work together and be one in those eternal things which we do not understand therefore we could not enter into the kingdom of God. it is nothing but the power of God that has preserved this settlement. the Indians could have killed every man woman &amp; child here, &amp; not a man had a gun ready to defend himself. when you have become of one heart &amp; mind he has treasures for you &amp; has given us capacity to see if we will magnify our calling with every thing we have to do in our lives. we are approaching very swiftly the time when Jesus will come to see if we are of one heart &amp; mind which the Prophet Joseph said would be in this generation &amp; will manifest himself to the Saints &amp; take up his abode with him. this was said 24 years ago &amp; in 26 years more if we r not prepared to meet Jesus &amp; angels we shall be wiped out &amp; sent to hell. we r fast approaching the time I do not care what was done in the morning of creation or the days of Noah. I want to know what this people will do. will you be Saints &amp; live your religion &amp; magnify your callings in the Church I will now tell this people what they should do. I will tell the Bishop in the presence of the people what to do. Bishop I tell you, go &amp; start this wall &amp; build it 6 feet thick &amp; 12 or 14 feet high shut up every gate except two &amp; then you can lay down in safety &amp; an enemy cannot come upon you. if this is not the will of the Lord I do know it is my will &amp; you should not question any  further. God wants it done &amp; I want it done &amp; dont stop until you are secured &amp; that is enough your stacks have been so placed that one Indian could fire all this place &amp; others shoot you down while you are fighting the fire. what if the people in Jackson C what would have been the situation of the people. why, the liars &amp; goats would have had their heads cut off but the wheat &amp; tares had to be transplanted together in the wilderness. it was not the act  of Joseph that caused the removal of this people. it is the people that govern &amp; control which is the democracy of heaven. the democracy of earth is division and mark it, there will be a division here before long among this people. now if you will all do right &amp; live a holy life angels will come &amp; visit us &amp; stay with us all night &amp; you will have many revelations &amp; be happy. we know we ought to pray &amp; would not neglect it, if we loved the Lord. you may do just as you have a mind to when I am gone but I beg &amp; beseech of you to do right. I want you to build a strong wall &amp; be  safe so that whatever comes along you may be secure &amp; bar your gates &amp; be careful &amp; dont let the devil reign in you &amp; all will be right &amp; God bless you &amp; I bless you. let us be ^of^ one heart &amp; mind in the things that we do comprehend &amp; then we shall be one in things we shall hereafter know.    it to the body. but it is for me to carry out his designs &amp; do his will for when I do the will of  Pres      ENDENTRY  the keys of salvation. when I feel reluctant to do his will I feel bad &amp; so do you all. when I do his will I can sleep in peace &amp; my heart is consoled all the day long. this is also the case with you when you do not do as your Bishop tells you. last year your improvements were all scattered about but now you are got into a smashed suckertash pie. now go to &amp; save yourselves against all selfishness. I am going to put my property &amp; all my wives into the Church &amp; then nothing can be taken out of the Church. I am going to dedicate all  I have to God. when a man turns away from the Priesthood he forfeits every thing even his life for that is no longer his. my body is only lent to me by the Lord  and I forfeit every thing when I go astray. if righteousness was laid to the line  it would take many heads from their shoulders &amp; the day will be when that will be done    Lake to President Young to alter this or that I pray that this people may do right for when you dishonor the priesthood you dishonor God I have been told  that some have said that I will honor the priesthood  but I will not honor him that holds the priesthood but I say that you cannot honor one without honoring the other. Bishop Walker is presiding here follow his council &amp; all will be right and the blessing of  God will rest upon you even so Amen          ENDENTRY May 7, 1854    house in two rooms. W.

And when we called upon Walker He lay down  in the dirt &amp; did not feel disposed to talk but  Young manifested great patience with him even after the patience of most men was exhausted. He went to him &amp; lifted him out of the dirt &amp; finally got him to talk some the following is a synopsis of the conversation    feel as though He could talk. And when I herd that President Young was coming I felt that I had no heart I do not  want to talk I want to hear President Young talk &amp; he sit still &amp; here others talk. President Young gave him some tobaco he said when he had plenty of tobaco then all his  friends would come in &amp; smoke with him but when He was out of tobaco Gov Young said I have brought so beef cattle for you I want one killed so you kan have  a feast while we are here He wanted to have the mormons sing before the parties take a smoke.

He said He wanted his child to get well &amp; then He would go with us but do not wants to go till his child gets well. He said Walker was a great chief &amp; President  Young was a great chief &amp; what he said was true that he could not say any thing wrong. Petetnet spoke &amp; said  that that would be good &amp; not steal nor kill any body that one could now go alone &amp; not be killed their would  be no blood in their path. Walker wished President  Young to write a Letter so he could show it to the people  &amp; let them know that we were at peace so their would  be no difficulty with the people. President Young wrote one Dr Sprague gave medicine to the sick child &amp; gave  Walker directions how to deal with the child &amp; 10 others  which Dr Sprague had left medicine for 2 of which was vary sick they all got well. (Sister Lorenzo Young a was quite sick with the Lung complaint Dr Sprague gave  medicine to her she got well &amp; several others in the camp was under his care) On parting with Walker at his tent He said we now understand each other that they were now to have all pease so all could now go on the road in peace  &amp; not be afraid could now put in wheat &amp; corn &amp; one alone without for somebody to kill them He now wanted to have the road clear without any blood in it.

And as to seeing an Apostles the people would  expect to melt if one came along. But all of these Ideas are vain &amp; foolish for this company before me to night does not begin to be adorned inside or out as they should be in order to meet with the Angels in heaven who are adorned in purity power &amp; Glory clothed with clean white linen. I will say a word concerning danceing with the Gentiles. As I have got up this party If I had felt disposed to have invited some Gentiles here would they have contaminated me or this company No because the priesthood rules here with the keys of power truth light &amp; knowledge. And I would not suffer any thing that is rong for I would controll own way or break up the party.

And as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others I aranged them with this view as they stand above. Temperance first as it tends to procure that cooleness &amp; clearness of head  which is so necessary whare constant vigilance was to be up and a guard maintained against the unremiting attraction of ancient habits and the force of perpetual temptations.    easy and my desire be that I improved in virtue &amp; considering that in conver- sation it was obtained rather by the use of the ear than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I was getting unto of prattling, punning, and jesting which ownly made me acceptable to trifling company. I gave silence the second place this and the next order I expected would allow me more time for attending to my project and my  studies. Resolution once become habitual would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all the subsequent virtues Frugality and industry releiving me from my remaining debt and producing affluence and independance would make more   ENDENTRY     Pythagoras in the golden verses daily examination  would be nessary, I contrived the following method for conducting that examination. I made a little Book in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues I  ruled each page with red ink so as to have seven columns One for each day of the week, marking each column with a letter for the day I crossed these columns with 13 red lines marking the begining of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues on which line   black spot every fault I found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day       Eat not to dulness, drink not to elevation       Sil **** Ord ***** Res ** Fru ** Ind * Sinc Jus Mod Clea Tran Chas Hum    virtues successively. thus in the first week  great guard was to avoid even the least offence against temperance leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance ownly marking evry evening the faults of the day.   ENDENTRY  clear of spots I supposed the habit of that virtue so much strengthend and its opposite weakened that I might venture extending my attention to include the next and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots proceding thus to the last I could get through a course complete in 13 weeks and four courses in a year. And like him who having a garden to weed does not attempt to eradicate all the bad barbs at once which wood exced his reach and his strength but works on one of the beds at a time and having acco- mplished the first proceds to a second so I should have I hoped the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress made in virtue by clearing success- fully my lines of their spots till in the end by a num- ber of courses I should be happy in viewing a clean Book after a thirteen weeks daily examination       And that there is all nature cries aloud Through all her works He must delight in virtue And that which he delights in must be happy    ing it an excellent &amp; worthy example, and hoping it may do me or my children or some other persons some good. Another principle of Dr Franklins life &amp; recommendation is vary good under many circumstances in life He recom mends to all persons in the pulpit, at the bar, in debate, in conversation to take the modarate ground in Phrase- ology to say I think or apprehend, I believe or I am of the opinion that things are thus &amp; so.

I want you to wake up yourselves &amp; then wake up your wives &amp; Children &amp; stop your lying  &amp; stealing &amp; take that Burthen upon your Backs which belong to you then the Presidency &amp; Twelve will ownly carry their own burthens. The time has come or is near at hand when many that have trifled with the priesthood &amp; the things of God will be destroyed &amp; go to Hell cross lots &amp; those who are not faithful in magnifying the priesthood it will be taken from them &amp; given to others and that quickly and I know it for Angels, Prophets, &amp; Holy men say it &amp; it will be fulfilled.    I never want to see another man dance untill he can do it by the power of God. I felt that spirit once &amp; Brother Brigham shouted Hosanna for we was both filled with the spirit Neither do I want to see any more feasting  at present. I dont want to see any more Jealous feelings some of our Bishops get Jealous of the servants of God no man would be if He was filled with the Holy Ghost. I would chastize a man if He stood in  my way when I knew that I am a messenger sent of God. President  Young says if the people do not do right He will not stay long with them but shall go the other side of the veil if He goes I shall not stay long behind him because we will not have one between us  and if you dont do your duty we shall go soon I have had many men try to stand between me &amp; president Young &amp; when I have been to see him many have snubed me but I have seen enough of  this. And that man that will try to do it He must look out  for God &amp; his angels will smite him. I have no objection to men  coming to President Young to comfort him &amp; do him good &amp; when he gives them a wife give him $10 or $20 dollars according as He may value his wife. But men must not try to separate us if they  do they will be cursed I understood that Brother Woodruff got  a whiping from one of them lately But I tell you that although He is a small man He is all gold &amp; you will find it so in the end &amp; you may be thankful to ever get as good a place as He will get  for he is the pure gold &amp; I wish you would get as good as He is the Bishops will not repeat what the missionaries say for they are Jealous. But if you will get the spirit of God upon you there  will be no Jealous feelings in your heart. you want the spirit  of God &amp; the power of the priesthood to rest upon you as it did  upon Joseph &amp; does upon the Presidency &amp; Twelve. take that priesthood upon you which belongs to you &amp; magnify it. The Missionaris want to wake up then wake up the Bishops &amp; then wake up the  people &amp; all live your religion &amp; all will go well and if you  will live up to your priviliges here &amp; get the spirit of this refermation  it will reach all over the Earth &amp; go to the ends of the Earth &amp; the wicked  will not have power over us but this work will go from Zion through all the world as the sap of a tree will go from the trunk to the end of evry  limb &amp; twig. I want to see the power of God among this people that  they may have faith to remove mountains if necessary but the power  of God will ownly increase as the spirit of God increases among the people if we will do our duty ^&amp;^  would say if they came against us Let my servant Brigham send 200  men &amp; they would lick them up, for God would assist to fight our Battles with the storm hail &amp; snow, &amp; they would be destroyed. I know this would be done but we must get the faith of the Ancients   ENDENTRY  ever was on Earth. Now wake up Brethren &amp; see that you purify yourselves before you try to purify others then go forth &amp; lift up your voice like a trumpet &amp; call upon all men to repent get full of the Holy Ghost &amp; there is not a man that will do it but what will be filled with Prophesyings as were the ancient Nephites, and little Boys 4 years old will prophesi people reform.  this refermation &amp; men will not prosper untill they do their duty to God &amp; each other. I have no desire to attend any recreation untill this people are filled with the spirit &amp; power of God &amp; I do not think that President Young has. if you will rise up &amp; do your duty you will be blessed &amp; no man that rises up against us in this place will prosper if we do our duty &amp; we wash our feet against them I believe in washing our feet against our Enemies.  The spirit of God  has been upon us for more than a year &amp; the people would play laugh &amp; trifle about it but if they had the spirit of God &amp; done their duty they would have seen it this has been my feelings all the time I have felt that the people were trifling with the things of God. Brother Jedediah is fallen a mighty man is taken from us but his power is here it still rests upon Brother Brigham &amp; myself &amp; when we lay hands upon ^another^  of God &amp; of Jedediah will rest upon him in full force that he may do the work &amp; fill his place as a counciller to the president &amp; I know it May God  Bless you Amen    He was followed by D. D. Hurt &amp; savage then Brigham Young said why we take the Elders for Missionaries who have just came in is that we can set them to work while their  armour is on for it has generally been the case that soon after the Elders come in they throw down their armour &amp; some are so far left to themselves they do not enjoy the spirit of God. In answer to the  question of Brother Savage about people restoring what they hav stolen {from  in the first place I would say I would not steal but whare it cannot be restored I would say put it into the Perpetual Emigration Fund to gather poor for I would  not have any thing to do with it    which Joshua Midgeley were  called to go out on Missions.
