September 1, 1875    morning at Eight oclok and forty minutes Thus time and  death are thin Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. No man knoweth  whose turn will come next, many of us will soon pass  a way. No man has Ever lived in the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter Day Saints and Died who has left  a cleaner or brighter record for both time and Eternity then the Apostle G. A. Smith. No man has been more diligent, virtuous, honest, or valiant  in the Testimony of Jesus Christ than He in the last dispensation and fulness of times. He was an Apostle fore ordained from before the foundation of the world  to come forth in the last dispensation &amp; fulness of times and assist in laying the foundation of the Church and  kingdom of God in the last days and assist in building it up, and He has well &amp; faithfully fulfilled his mission He drew the first load of stone for the building of the first last days   ENDENTRY  He received the priesthood in his youth, and He was but a boy when He went up in Zions Camp for the redemption of zion in 1834, forty one years before his death, and He has labored  diligently for the building up of the kingdom to the day of his death. He has been true and faithful in his labor &amp; Testimony to  the End. No two men have been more closely allied together in the Church and Kingdom of God on the Earth in the last days than George A. Smith &amp; Wilford Woodruff, for Forty One years past we went together in Zions Camp. we travelled together on  mission through the United States, we were Ordained at the same time into the Cornor  stone of the Far West Caldwell Co Mo, in 1838. we  travelled together through London together in connexion with Heber C Kimball. we returned home together on the same ship sleeping in the same birth we have labored together for Fifteen years as Historians in the same office, we had  labored together as Legislative Councellors for Many years in  Salt Lake City, And I can bear testimony of a truth that in all our labors and associations together under all these circumstances there never was an unplesant word passed  between us in our lives, and we have administered in many of the Holy Ordinances together in the flesh and to day He is ming- ling with the most Noble Spirits in his ministry &amp; Priesthood in the Eternal world, and He is pure and Holy. He has fought a good fight &amp; gained the victory, and He is prepared to come forth in the morning of the first Resurrection, clothed with glory, immortality  and pass by the Angels &amp; the Gods to his crown Throne &amp; Kingdom and  mingle with the Gods Forever   ENDENTRY  I spent a part of the day in the Endowment House we baptized for the dead 181.

Q. Cannon J. Taylor W  Woodruff &amp; D H Wells FIGURE W. Woodruff said I feel  to bear my testimony to what the Apostles Have said to  you I have had vary peculiar feelings for the last 3 months of my life. I view in the vision of my mind  men in these mountains bearing the Holy and Everlasting  Priesthood of the Son of God and these men were fore- ordained before the world was created to come here  on the Earth in this dispensation on purpose to labor with the Lord to build up his kingdom on the Earth, and  then I view in the vision of my mind  Devels, fallen spirits gathered to gether to make war against   ENDENTRY  These forty thousand priest of the Lord and strive to hender their building up the Kingdom of God, and we have fulfilled as a people that part of the  Saviors parable of the Ten Virgins whare He says that while the Bridegroom tarried they all slumbered  and slep. we have all slumbered ^and slept^ and the word of  the Lord to me is that it is time for this kingdom of Priest to arise and trim their lamps and to take oil in their vessels with their lamps &amp; prepare to go forth to meet the Bridegroom for He is at the door. It is time for Zion to arise and let her  light shine I do hope that this body of Bishops and Elders will carry out the council of president  Brigham Young to go to &amp; organize our wards  into the United Order. Some Bishop say they cannot  see it, then let all such resign their office &amp; let some other man take it who has the light of Christ in  him and can see it, let no Bishop stand in the way of the Elders of Israel it  is time for us to set our Houses in order &amp; prepare  for that which is to come. It is time for us to teach  our wives &amp; children to lay aside the New York Ledger and all other novels and store up ^in^ our minds with the Revelations of God, And we should stop  sending thousands of Dollars out of the Country to buy  Novels to teach our children ^vanity^ and sustain our own  press and Evry family in Zion should take the  Juvinile Instructor, and our owne papers   ENDENTRY  I will also say we have many Elders who  have but one wife who are abundantly able to support more but their wives will not let them do it, any man who  will permit a woman to lead him and bind him down  is of but little account in the Church  this law of the pluraliy of wives is a Revelation &amp; Commandment of God to us  and we should obey it. But one says if you do judge MCkane will be after you. But who cares for Judge  McKain or any of the wicked world. This warefare is between God &amp; the Devil, Christ &amp; Balial, Saint &amp; Sinner light &amp; Darkness good &amp; Evil. Do Right and let the  consequences follow, Jesus Christ &amp; his Saints will  overcome &amp; gain the victory. What has given us the victory since we have been in these vallies of the Mountains The Lord hath done it because we have obeyed that part of  the Celestial Law of God, and it is by this principle that  our Delegate in Congress has been sustained there so  long because He has sustained this law. Then ye Bishops &amp; Elders arise &amp; keep this law that you may inherit  its glory. Again I wish to &amp; obey President Youngs council in storeing up the grain of your wards, for I tell you in the name of  Jesus Christ that famine is among the judgments of God  which are at the Door of this generation, and judgments will begin at the House of God and to befor many years  Have or Els the Lord never spake by my mouth    ENDENTRY October 10, 1875    Sunday Conference met at 10 oclok Erastus Snow prayed F D Richards     63 Minuts &amp; President Young 14.
