 Provo City, August 7th 89President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,The Brigham Young Academy commenced its fourteenth academic year last Monday morning with over 100 students, which number is still increasing, and by the indications we expect one of the largest atten-dances this Academy has ever seen. There are now al-ready 45 Normals enrolled, of whom 10 come under the Church appropriation thus far. The names of those selected on the strength of promises given dur-ing last academic year, are as follows:Charles Dorius, of Ephraim; Wm. Winters of ;John Johnson, of  ;  Geo. Shelley of Lehi; Alex-ander Nielson, of Provo; John H. Wootton, of American Fork; Alice Findley, of Panacca, Nev.; Mary L. Hansen, of Parowan; Amelia Fillerup, of Lake Shore; Annie E. Carlsen, of   . There have been, however,so many Normals last year, who have paid their tuition all along in the hope to come under the appropriation, that I am in great embarrassment in regard to some of them. Several have been 
 nan 
 2. continuedpacified by me, and have made up their minds to pay their tuition this second year also, while others had no such expectations at all, and have, therefore, asked for no benefits.  But a few remain concerning whom I do not know what to do. I have either to send them home again, or pay their tuition myself. They are deserving, and have had partly a promise to the effect, if there should be a chance; their names are: Alice Reynolds, of Salt Lake City; Annie Brown, of Pleasant Grove; Wallace Billings, of Manti; and George Middleton, of Ashley's Fork; and Jos. Dunyon, of Draper. I lay the case of these five last named students before you in the hope of getting some instructions in regard to the course, I shall take concerning them. The last two ^but one^ have been practical teachers already. Our Normal Department once enjoyed an additional appro-priation for ten students from the Utah County Court, which for fear of "Liberal" opposition had to be withdrawn, and we have kept up

Crosbyhas written to you also about the difficulty, enclosing myletter to the P. S. Board per A. N. Cutler. I see no other way be-sides finishing the controversy.  Permit me to call yourattention to the passage in my summary report to you,of July 17, where on page 6, I refer to the Panguitch StakeAcademy.  As my letter concerning the matter has beenforwarded to you by Bro. Crosby, a comparison bet-ween my report to you and that letter will show thecorrectness of my statement.  My enclosed letter toBro. Crosby of today, will furnish the last argumentin the case, and I shall abide by your decision.If you shall direct not otherwise, please let Bro.Geo. Reynolds send my letter to Bro. Crosby.With kind regardsYour brother in the GospelKarl G. MaeserPlease return Bro. Crosby'sletter to him.

The reorganization of the de-partment also now, in order to meet the require-ments of our advanced grade in the Churchschool-service; and the special course for lady teachers,all of which arrangements the Junior Normalsclasses in the other Academies are not yet prepared to comply with, necessitate extra pecuniary efforts, that it will be impossible for this Academy alone to make! I once before proposed to the General Board the establishment of a Primary Drill Department for our Normals, composed of about 24 to 30 children from Chartclass up to 11 Reader-grade, free of charge, to be conducted on the alterna-ting plan by Normalstudents entirely under the su-pervision of the Normal Professor.

 Provo City, August 26   89President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Again I am under the necessity of submitting anenclosed letter to you for the purpose of getting instructionsin regard to further proceedings in the matter. As theletter explains itself I need not refer to the special pointsthere in myself.Bro. Harnes of Kaysville, chairman of the local Boardthere, wrote me about two weeks ago, that Bro. JedediahTaylor, whom I had recommended to them as their Princi-pal for this Seminary, had not sufficiently impressedthem at his visit at Kaysville, and theyproposed, there-fore, to engage him only temporarily for one term.  Thisproposition Bro. Taylor refused to accept, and I wrotethem that I had no teacher for them under such a con-dition as t would be extremely unfair to any teacher tobe set adrift under some pretext, after all schools weresupplied, and he stood a poor chance to get a position.Another thing it would be, if there were just complaintswhich should prove by investigation to be well grounded.They have reconsidered their original proposition,

Upon your advice and instructions on any or all of these stated points will depend my course to a great extent in this Normal Department. Knowing your great sense for justice and equality for all, and at the same time the fin-ancial difficulties surrounding you, I do not make these statements for the purpose of obtaining more means, but to get your direction in regard to the best course for me to pursue in the matter.With kind regardsYour brother in the GospelKarl G.

 Provo City, Febr. 15.  [18]90President Wilford WoodruffDear Brother,In compliance with your instructions I started for PriceStation at D.g RG. Rg, Saturday, Febr. 8, at 1 P.M. having tele-graphed my arrival to Bro. L. M. Olsen, at that place. Arri-ving at Price at 5 P.M. was kindly recieved by Bro. Olsenand hospitably entertained by him until Sunday morn-ing. Starting for Huntington at 5 A.M. arriving at theplace at 9 A.M. met President Larsen of Emery Stake at theresidence of Bro. Howard, his second counsellor, and Presidentof the Stake Board of Education. One hour's conversationbefore the morning meeting convinced me of the existenceof a strong party feeling about the location of the Academy.Huntington or Castle Dale were the [watchwerds], and eachparty endeavored of its influence are in their favor Stating,however, to these bretheren your instructions, that neitheryourself nor the General Board desired to influence themeither way, leaving the settlement of their question entirelyto the Saints of Emery Stake, I had no authority whateverto take sides.  When I found that Presidency of theStake was divided, the Stake Board in its majority lean-ing one way, the High Council in its majority leaning 
 nan 
 continuedthe other, and that even some bitter feeling was exis-ting, finding expression of in various insinuations andrecriminations, which it would have been extremelyunwise to permit to break out in open Conference.I proposed to President Larsen, to postpone the officialdiscussion of the subject until after the afternoon mee-ting, when he might call a special meeting for thatpurpose, composed of the Stake Presidency, High Coun-cil, Stake Board, and the whole Bishopric of theStake, all the members of these various bodies being repor-ted present. I expected under God's blessing to have oppor-tunity to engender a spirit of unanimity on this sub-ject among the Saints before that Council should meet.The meeting was crowded both in the fore- and in theafternoon, the bretheren making the most of me bothtimes as far as physical effort in talking was con-cerned. The subject of the welfare of the rising genera-tion and our educational system forming the chief-topic of all the discourses by the speakers. The Councilwas as stated above, and by request of Pres. Larsen Ilaid ^before the bretheren^ the principles according to which this wholedeliberation should be conducted. To the great 
 continuedhonor of the bretheren it must be said, that each sidewas represented sincerely, honestly, and in spirit wil-ling to abide by the decision of the whole Council.Once only a voice called for explanations of the causeof all the bad feeling in the past, that was frowned down,however, by the almost unanimous sentiment of themeeting. After Pres. Larsen had several times calledfor more expression of views on the subject, none re-sponding, "[ipoustive]" was called, and the vote taken.Pres. Larsen never committing himself for either sideduring all the proceedings. Votes stood: Huntington 10,Castle Dale 29. One of the bretheren from Huntingtonmoved to have this vote made unanimous, whichwas carried. Seldom has it been my happy lot inmy ministry to witness such a brotherly feeling asthere was mannifested in that Council-Meeting, andI blessed the brotheren in the name of the Lord, tel-ling them, that I should have done the same of thevote had gone the other way, recognizing that theSpirit of God had guided them in their deliberations.The meetings on Monday more equally crowded andblessed with a spirit of anonimity and rejoicing 
 continuedThe Conference sustained the decision of the Coun-cil to have the Academy located at Castle Dale. Onlyfive brothern from Huntington voting against it. With the exception of the rather ominous beginning of mymission on Sunday morning before meeting time,this has been one of the happiest educational visit I have made. The Stake Board of Education met at noon on Monday, accepted Bro. Alexander Jamesonas Principal, voted him a salary of $60 per month, andconcluded to run the Academy for two terms to theend of the schoolyear. I had intended to go over toCastle Dale with the brothern and start the Academy,but very stormy weather having set in during the day,the bretheren thought it better for me to return with Bro.Olsen to Price at once, as it would not be safe to riska return to Price, 22 miles on terrible road, in stormy weath-er this time of year. Arrived at Price at 9 P.M. andreturned to Provo Tuesday morning.With kind regardsYour brother in the GospelKarl G. Maeser 
 Provo city, Febr. 22nd, [18]90President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,The copy of the letter of Bro. Attewall Wootton, Pres.of the Wasatch Stake Board of Education, to President A. Hatch, is before me and has been purused with great care. As I cannot speak by personal knowledgeof the case, but have before me only Principal EnochJorgensen's letter and two printed extracts from the"Wasatch Wave," which do not coincide entirely with Bro. Wootton's report to Pres. Hatch, it reduces itself in my mind to a question of veracity between the statements in my possesion and the proceedings of investigation before the Wasatch S.B.E. As the case hasbeen reported, however, to the General Board by me, I have nothing to remark anymore in regard to the merits of the case. There is a statement, though, in Bro. Wootton'sletter to which I must take exception. He criticises Bro. Jorgensen's action in reporting ^to me^ the disgracefulconduct of a member of the Stake Board, by which the efforts of the Stake Academy in reforming thegeneral spirit of the youth in that neighborhood were paralyzed to some extent Bro. Wootton con 
 continuedtents that the case should never have gone outside of the Stake. Not mentioning the circumstance that the offence had been known to every member of that Boardfor some time without anything being done about ituntil the General Board demanded an investigation,it was clearly that Principal's duty to ask my advice in the matter, what position he should take in the premises. I did advise Bro. Jorgensen in my answerin following words: "I fully realize, dear Brother, the difficulties of your position in that peculiar Stake of Zion, in fact, I was aware of it before you went there, and,as you know, for this reason the Lord directed me to select you for that position. I have carefully read the two clippings from the " Wasatch Wave" and your own com-mends upon them. It is a serious matter for a member of a Board of Education to disgrace himself in the manner in which Geo. Cluff has done it, and I shall report the circumstance at the meeting of the General Board next Friday, Febr. 7 for instructions." There were some general instructions in my letter to Bro. Jorgensen, which, however, had no direct bearing upon the case, besides being available in their applications to any 
 Provo City,  September 26. 89.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In compliance with your instructions of Sept 7th recievedper telegram, I made appointments for my visits at Far-mington and Kaysville for Sept 11 & 12 respectively.Having a few hours to spare on Tuesday, Sept. 10, betweenmy calls at your office, I spent them visiting the 18Ward L.D.S. Seminary, Horace Cummings, Principal,Mrs. Hardy & Miss Snow, Assistants.  I found the threeclassrooms, thus far occupied well filled with pu-pils, and the recitations in running order.  I found,however, the Daily Pogramms not yet in a settledand well defined order, nor was there a Plan for thevarious classes made out.  The discipline in Bro. Cum-mings' department did not seem to be as yet firm-ly established, while the recitations of the two lady-teachers deserve much commendation in this respect.I have called Bro. Cummings' attention to thesepoints and have received the assurance that Ishall find these draw backs over come at my next visit.  The recitations themselves, how ever, reflectmuch credit upon those three teachers.  The pupil 
 continuedemergency. I am decidedly of the opinion that Bro. Jos-gensen has simply acted in the line of his well definedduty, as much as it was mine to report the case to theGeneral Board. I should very much desire, that Bro. Woottoshould be instructed to that effect, as this case estab-lishes a precedent for similar ones in the future.If the President of that Stake Board and the othermembers are of the opinion that the Principal of theAcademy has overstepped his lines, the position ofBro. Jorgensen becomes to that extent more difficut,than it is already.With kind regardsYour brother in the GospelKarl G. Maeser 
 went through this exercies with spirit attention, andlively interest, showing such progress the short time takeninto consideration.  My next visit will be one whole day,when I shall be able to form a more correct estimateof the spiritual and intellectual standing of the insti-tution.  Wednesday, Sept. 11 I arrived at Farmington intime for the opening of the morning exercises at theDavis Stake Academy, Bro. Joshua Greenwood, Principal,James Steed, & Mr. Welling, Assistant. The students weredivided into three departments, located one in the main-hall of the Meetinghouse and the other two in Council-[shop] [wherf] and vestry.  Considering the somewhatinconvenient arrangement of the passages and studies,and the entire unappropriateness of the locality forschoolpurposes, the order, quickness, and disciplinemaintained by the students did not only reflectvery creditabilty upon the Principal and Teachers, but[madd purified] as much at home with them as ifthat school had been in operation for years in ourchurchschool system.  I attended every recitation inthe fore-and afternoon, alternating between themas circumstances suggested, and cannot 
 too much in praise of the labors of these teachers andtheir Principal. In the afternoon a young Bro. Willerfrom Farmington made his appearance, in the Academy,and took charge of classes in Gen. History, Algebra, andPhysiology in a manner that astonished me, andI recommend that young man to your attention,for there is a rising young teacher in him. I haveadvised Bro. Greenwood to have Bro. Miller applyfor a license as teacher in the Churchschool- service.The Students of that Academy, are full of enthusiasemfor their studies, and go any length for their Principal,as do the Authorities and People of Farmington.President Smith, his counselors, and several mem-bers of the Stake Board of Education met with mealso in consultation about the educational affairsof the Stake especially in regard to the Kaysvilleembroglio.

The Seminary occupies theupper story of the Coop-Store, two rooms, commodious,well lighted and ventilated, nicely furnished, separateentrances to each room, aby the liberality of Bro. Madsen,owner of the building, under very resonable conditionsin regard to rent for premises and use of furniture.There can be over 200 student accommodated. 100 students have been in [atten]dance during the two terms the Seminary has been in existance thus far; they wereclassified in a IV and V Reader grade; forming, how-ever, for a start, only one department, called Preparatory.The members of the Local Board have taken a very activepart in the development of their Seminary, realizing thenecessity for their utmost efforts in counteracting theinfluence of the Presbyterian Academy at Mt. Pleasant.Bro. Christensen, the Principal, is one of our most prom-ising Churchschool-teachers, combining his labors inthe Seminary with his appointments in the Sunday- 
 and [energy] of the Authorities and People of thatStake. After schoolhouse at [Farm] City, some membersof the Stake Board, and School [illegible ] students saidmyself meet in the upper room of the Academy.  Prin-cipal and Teachers made their reports and I had toanswer several points of inquiry about manag-ment and organization where I especially accen-tuated the duties of the Lady teacher to regard to herparticular mission in our churchschools.Counsellor Hays took me the same [pruening] inhis buggy to Kaysville in answer to a specialinvitation from that Local Board to attend aSoiree in the Seminary building gotten up forthe purpose of raising some more means forschool furniture and utensils. At the visit and atPres. John R. Barnes we were joined by Presidents Smith andCall of Davis Stake. The new Seminary-building is finishedand reflects much credit upon the enterprise of thepeople of Kaysville and the management of Bro.Barnes, as Chairman of the Board.  It was arranged,that all discussion of the misunderstanding betweenthe stake Authorities and the Kaysville Board 
 school and in the Mutual Improvement Association.The influence of that young man among the young people atMt. Pleasant is very remarkable. Mrs. Erickson, as lady-teacher, seconds the labors of the Principa[l] [in] her manage-ment of the lady-students. The classwork done undermy observation during the day showed a satisfactoryefficiency considering the short time the Seminary hasbeen in existence. A Boardmeeting and a lecture onour Churchschool system in the meetinghouse at nighton our Churchschool System, concluded the proceedingsof the day. The following day, Friday, March 14, wasPublic Examination at the Seminary. Class exercises,Resitations, Vocal Music, and Presentations of tokens ofrespect to the Teachers from the Students, Speeches byMembers of the Board, Patrons of the Institution, exhib-ition of Ladies Work, Specimens of Drawing andof Penmanship, were features of the occasion, thatmarked the opening of a new era of education in Mt. Pleasant. The mission I gave ^offered^ to the young peoplein the name of President Woodruff, to set hencefortha good example in all things before their companionswas respect accepted by them enthusicastically.Saturday, March 15. brought me to Ephraim, whereI spent the day in getting posted about the affairsof the Stake Academy in conversations with PresidentPeterson and Principal Greenwood.Sanpete Stake Academy.The Academy occupies as yet a building not very welladapted for schoolpurposes. The [lower room houses] 
 should be postpound until the councilormeeting on thefollowing day, in consequence of which arrangment wespent a very enjoyable at that inceedingly will coudor-ted entertainment. The size of the Kaysville Seminary-building is the same as that of Farmington Academy-building with the difference that Farmington is nowbuilding the right wing from the main entrance, whileKaysville has built the left wing. The finishing in-side is tasteful and subsationtial and will be similarin both also. As the Kaysvile Seminary was notready for opening until September 16, I had thetime on Thursday, Sept. 7 at my disposel until5 P.M.  Th. which I thought I could occupy to greater ed-vantage by opening a few hours at the Weber StakeAcademy at Ogden, and took therefore, the morningtrain for that city. Bro. L. F. Moench, Principal andOscar Vance, Assistant, with usual Volunteer [Insuibels]as Tutors, were found busily at work. The attendenceis about 90, for an Academic and In terms [with]and [^I^] [Preparator] Dept. with some academic [word smudged] thisadded. Bro. Moench explained to me he [income]as the comparitively small attendance

The Boardowns a building which has been occupied thus farby the districtschools, but will be taken [po]ssessionof by the Academy in the fall, with prospects of gre someimprovements to insure greater convenience andfacilitates to teachers and students. A lecture by my-self to the Polysophical Society concluded the day.Sunday, March 106 gave me the opportunity of witnessingthe finest work in the organization of a Sunday schoolTheological Class that it ever has been my privilegeto become acquainted with. The credit for which isaccorded by the brethren to the untiring efforts of Bro.Alma Greenwood, that class seems to have collec-ted all the young people of Ephraim, of more matureaged filling the large hall to overflowing; they beingattracted and held there from Sunday to Sunday bythe spirited manner with which the exercises areconducted. An address the afternoon meetingin the Tabernacle, and a lecture in the evening at thesame place concluded my share of that day's work.Monday, March 167, found me spending the whole day inwitnessing the exercises at the Academy, conductedby Principal Greenwood, and his Assistant and Lady-teacher, Miss Carrie Henry. The students are dividedinto a Preparatory and an Intermediate Department,with several students taking advanced studiespreparatory to a Normal Course. All the classes re-cited very creditably, and the spirit and discipline, 
 is in the first place the "Freeschool system, recently inaugure-ted in Ogden, to content against, them the indifference of agreat many leading citizens from among our people,the many other [schoolships]. Seeing that Bros. Moenchand Vance were actually doing good work, and thatthe blame could scarcely be with them, I called on,Apostle F. D. Richards for advice in the matter.  AlthoughBro. Richards was seriously indispossed, he entered at oncewith deep earnest into the subject, and it was thoughtbest to lay this matter before you, if you would notinstruct me, perhaps to confer with Pres.

I outlined to the Brothern the mode of proceedurewhich the General Board under your direction hasadopted and while has been my course throughout, [gallos-]trating it from instances occurring in our Church school-Organization, unphasising the fact that the order ofthe Priesthood and the Spirit of the Church was thekeynote of all our operation.

Although one of my mosttrustworthy Normal Graduates has been laboringhere for two years as a teacher in the district-school,having been recommended by me for thatposition, by special request of the Stake Author-ities, it seems that the contrary influences ofthat place are too much for all our efforts.Bro Hayes, the teacher, reported to me, that it hasbeen impossible for him to keep the MutualImprovement Association alive, and he is goingaway now altogether discouraged in regard tothe outlook. That place seems to be a "ForlornHope," and ought to be held at any price.Richfield.Arrived at Richfield, Friday, March 21, and hadto address the by special invitation, the CountyTeachers Association immediately after myarrival, and spent the rest of the day inconversation with Bro. Jos. J. Anderson aboutAcademy-affairs.Saturday, March 21. Went with Pres. Seegmillerand others to Monroe to fill an appointmentfor the evening. The Stake Authorities andBoard of Education deem it advisable to havea churchschool in this place, although the [mans] 
 their Stake President, ever acting upon any advice of hisin their educational movement. In honor to the brethernof Kaysville it must be said, that one after anotheracknowledges his ^and their^ mistakes declaring, if they had under-stood this matter as they did now, this ill feeling andmisunderstanding would never have arisen. Onlyone member seemed to remain unreconciled and saidso. President Smith addressed the meeting with greatform, logic, and feeling, promising to get at the rootof all these hankerings by communening with theHigh Council of the Stake. There certainly was mani-sested in the beginning of the remarks of all theKaysville Brotheren a sentiment of accusations a-gainst the Stake Presidency, which I endeavored to show them, was the very cause of taking them offthe track. The meeting adjourned with the bestof feeling, apparently, between all parties, and thedifficulties amicably settled, pending some pointsto be adjusted here after at the High Counsil.  Byspecial appointment I addressed at 8 P.M. a largeaudience of young people in the interest of edu-cation in the Kaysville Meeting house 
 home, the only available place for that purpose,is ill adapted, being too high in the ceiling, makinga large echo and being too cold in winter, therefore.Elsinore.Sunday, March 24, addressed a meeting of theSaints at 10 A.M. By special solicitation of the Ward Authorities I permitted Bro. John Johnson,one of this year's Normal Graduates, and a Church-Normal at that, to teach their district-school thecoming school year. Elsinore being his homethey intend starting a churchschool sooner orlater, when Bro. Johnson is expected to takecharge of it.Richfield.Addressed this public meeting in the afternoonand lectured in the evening.Tuesday, March 25. Spent the whole day duringschoolhours at the Academy, conducted by Bro.Jos. J. Anderson, Principal, Mrs. Merinda Halliday,Lady-Teacher, and a Miss Alice Hoyt, Assistant,besides two Normal-students conducting singleclasses each. The Academy occupies the oldmeetinghouse, with four classrooms, and aPrincipal's office, and enjoys all the convenien-ces possible under the circumstances. The or-ganization of the school, the classwork, spirit,and discipline of the school characterize Bro.Anderson as a teacher of much ability, and asbeing ably supported by his Assistants 
 There are other points to be submitted to you, whichhave come up during my correspondence with variousChurchschools as their respective Boards. As Ihowever have troubled you already with our8 pages, I shall postpone further statements, un-til more fitting opportunities, when the laborspreparators to Conform us, will have been re-moved from your mind.Praying that Israel's God may beconstantly with you and reveal unto youHis Holy will concerning the welfare ofHis people  I remainYour brother in the GospelKarl G. Maeser 
 Somehow, however, Bro. Anderson has laboredunder the disadvantage of suceeding Bro. Isaac Hayes, who had possessed the hearts of the Au-thorities, the pupils, and the people at large, to anunusual degree. He being different from hispredecessor, and yet being measured by accordingto the latter's standard, my difference was chargedagainst him, and some influential men havingsecretly made up their mind before hand, inspite of my protestation, to have Bro. Hayes backanyway, no matter who succeeded him allthis combined to operate against Bro. Anderson,obstacles which his own disposition was not cal-culated to remove either. Hence a very un-pleasant scene, entirely undecerved and un-called for at on the at the Boardmeeting in theafternoon took place, in consequence of whichBro. Anderson's labors as Principal of the Sevier S.A.will cease at th[e] [c]lose of the term, and I have prom-ised to sustain Bro. Hayes as his successor, if theBoard can make satisfactory arrangements withhim. In company with Pres. Seegmiller droveover to Glenwood and addressed a meetingthere in the evening.Tuesday, March 26, started for Gunnison, viaRedmond, and gave the people by special re-quest a lecture in the evening, returning toProvo, via Juab, the next day Wednesday March 27 
 Beaver, Parowan, St. George, Kanab,& Panguitch Stakes.Wednesday, April 16 Left Provo for Beaver viaMilford and arrived at Beaver the followingday at 3 P.M. meeting that evening with the Prin-cipal R. Maeser, and his Assistant Daniel Bookin consultation about the Academy-affairs.Friday MarchApril 18. Spent the day in witnessing the exer-cises in the Academy, conducted entirely by Bro. Book,assisted by a Normal-student in repetition-workthe classes comprised only children of the PrimaryGrade this last term, the higher grade having beendiscontinued at the close of the previous termon account of too small attendance. The Prin-cipal exercising only a general supervision overthe Academy during the first and fourth term,and being actively engaged only in class workduring the second and third terms. This arrange-ment is decided unsatisfactory on generalprinciples, but must be tolerated temperarilyin consideration of the surrounding circum-stances. Bro. Book was recommended by me tothat Stake Board for the purpose of preparinghimself for the successership as Principal, myson Reinhard desiring to resign. It is generallyto the advantage of any school, if suddenchange in the Principalship can be calcu-lated for such [a great change]. Bro. Bookwent to [Bro. Reinhard] [4 illegible words] 
 Provo City, October 7, [189]0.President Wilford WoodruffChairman General Board of Education.Dear Brother,In conformity with your instructions and those of the GeneralBoard as published in the Deseret News and date of June 11, exam-inations of Church school teachers were held at Gunnison, Cedar,Logan, Salt Lake, and Provo at the specified times. Records of pro-ceedings have been carefully kept and are respectfully submittedin accompanying book. Results thus far obtained show, that15 Candidates have passed ^for^ the Primary Grade, 47 for the Intermediate Grade, and 3 as Specialists in Music.The Board of Examiners had held several consultations pre-vious to the appointed times for examinations, to decide uponthe propositions and the general mode procedure, minutes of which deliberations have also been recorded in the book beforeyou.Owing to the serious illness of Bro. Talmage, Bro. BenjaminCluff jr. recently returned from Michigan University, acted, accord-ing to your instructions, as Assistant Examiner, taking spea-cial charge of the examination-exercises at Salt lake City,while Bro. Tanner conducted those at Logan, and I thoseat Gunnison, Cedar, and Provo, although attending also 
 to study hard outside of schoolhours, preparatoryto his expected responsibilities. But althoughhe has done most excellent work in the lowergrade, his advancement in his studies is not yetmarked enough to notify me in recommendinghim to the Principalship for next year, and thetime of probation must be extended. The Boardhave sent me a petition to nominate him as Prin-cipal, he being quite popular, but mere popu-larity and efficient primary work are not theonly essential qualifications of a Principal.The Beaver Stake Board of Education have in cor-porated, bought a lot in town, have the foundationlaid for an Academy-building, and hope tohave it ready for occupancy in the fall. The planis good. Two story-building; seatingroom for 250 students. I suggest that all Boards of Educationin the Church deposit there copy of their plans with^send^specifications with the Secretary of the GeneralBoard.Parawan.Saturday, April 19. Left for Parawan, arriving thereat 4 P.M. Bro. Morgan Richards entertaining mehospitably during my stay.Sunday, April 20. Addressed Sunday school inthe morning, public meeting in the afternoon,and gave an educational address in theevening.Monday, April 231. The Bretheren at Parowanrequested me last year to supply them again 
 with a districtschool teacher, as I have done fora number of years in the past. In sending them aBro. Jensen one of last year's Graduates I hopedto have prepared the way for the establishmentof a churchschool, which was our mutual aim.Although Bro. Jensen has given entire satisfaction,the people looked longingly back to Bro. Oscar Vance, their former teacher, until now laboringas teacher in the Weber S. Academy at Ogden, andBro. Jensen himself, being a married man, desiresto be nearer Sanpete, the home of his relatives.Bro. Jensen goes, but Bro. Vance does not comeback as he intends to take a course of higherstudies at the L.D.S. College. This arouses the breth-eren at Parowan to start at once a church school,for which I will have to find a Principal.Cedar CityTuesday, April 22 left for Cedar where I had to fillan appointment to address in the new beautifulTabernacle the people in the evening.Wednesday, April 23. spent the day during schoolhours the exercises at the Stake Academy, conduc-ted by the Principal Bro. Mayhew H. Dalley, MissSarah Higbee, Assistant and Lady-teacher, andBro. Caslett as Music-teacher. There were a Prep-ratory and an Intermediate Department, withsome advanced classes in academic studies.The grade of intelligence, discipline, organization,and spirit of [1 illegible word] at this Acade-

The Board of Examiners asks here-by for instructions, whether the "General Efficiency" should bedetermined upon the Percentages obtained thus far, andor whether it should be left open until next year, untilthe Certificates be made out accordingly.By As instructed, Bro. Benjamin Cluff jr. is now engagedto have his academic diploma as Bachelor of Mathematicsand Didactics (BMD) corresponding to his diploma from theMichigan University as B.S. and will submit it to the Presidentfor signature in due time.In addition to the items contained in my letters of July 24, Sept. ^5 and^ and Sept. 250, ^all^both addressed to the Secretary Bro.

I have visited the Church schools at Nephi, Provo,Huntington, Castle Dale, Cottonwood, 14 Ward, 18 Ward, andthe L. D. S. College since the opening of the school season, metwith the Seventies, Boards, and in several instances alsowith the people of the respective districts in public meetings.Several schools have started in August, some in September,some before Conference in October, and some intend star-ting Oct. 13 and 20. The establishment of special theologicalclasses for children not attending church schools has been made one of the subjects of my remarks to the people. A course of instructions from the General Board is one of the essentialrequirements for this movement. In connection with this I recommend also to the General Board the imme-diate consideration of the report of the Ladies  Committee.In consideration of the importance of vocal instructionsin our church schools, I have requested that all Lady-Normals in our Normal classes should make thatbranch one of their specialties. 
 is becoming affected in many instances, and amuch larger continuance of the school under suchconditions would incur responsibilities upon some-one, that no body should dare to assume. Theexercises conducted by Bro. Nephi Savage, as Prin-cipal, Bro. Frank Woodbury, Assistant, & Mrs. Ro-seinia Jarvis, Assistant, and by two Normal-stu-dents with single classes, were exceedingly creditable.But Mrs. Jarvis as Lady-teacher, has not worked upsufficient courage to commence a course ofspecial instructions to the lady-students, adeficiency which I hope will be overcome inthe future with the help of the general instruc-tions to be published by our General LadiesCommittee, for the guidance of all ourLady Teachers throughout the Organization.From among the many interesting remarks madeby the Members of the Board, Stake- and Temple-Authorities present at the occasion, I only statethe one as characteristic of the spirit of thewhole school, viz: "That it had not be found ne-cessary to establish any special domestic regula-tions for the students outside of school, as theirconduct had been conceded by all to be so that they enjoyed the fullest confidence of [Board since][illegible] of it is the highest testimonial that canbe given to any school in point of worshipSaturday April 26, addressed by spirit I invite [illegible]& [illegible] school-teacher.

 Immediately after my visits to the church schools in the North, it will become necessary to attend the church schoolsat St. Johns, Snowflake, and St Joseph, Arizona, that havenever been visited, and are clamoring for a visit. The dis-tance I would entail ^cause^ expenses which I could not venture to in-cur without special instructions from the General Board.The irregularity with which many of our church schools have commenced this year s operations have in several instancesproved disadvantageous to our interests, in as much as somevery efficient teachers could not afford to wait until so latein the season before the schools to which I had assignedthem would open, and I had to grant them the privilegeof accepting positions in district schools. Some are askingnow for teachers after all available talent has been disposedof.Karl G. Maeser, Gen. Supt.P. S. Some Principals complain that there are members of theirrespective Boards that have never taken an active part, never attend Board meetings, nor care for the school, or patronize itin any way.

Several partieshave offered to donate city lots for the lo-cation of the Stake Academy, the most suitableamong them is situated south of the new Taber-nacle, just across the road.

John Swenson,his Assistant and Lady-Teacher, miss Caroline Fillerup having returned home at the close of theprevious term, the attendance having fallen off.Bro. Swenson has made his mark among theyoung people at Panguitch. He has a herculeantask before him, for the cowboy-element hasthus far the controlling one in the neighborhood.Horseracing, gambling, footracing &c &c on the Sunday &c are the characteristics of the youngmen there, and nowhere in all my travels amongthe people in Zion have I seen such a loosenessin manners, even in public meeting, as it showeditself there, although I was told, the young boyshad been uncommonly well behaved that day.But the President of the Stake and the Bretherenof the Board stand by Bro. Swenson, and quitea number of young men have already forsakentheir evil ways. There were students of the Pre-paratory and Intermediate Departments, andsome of the Primary Dep, mixed, and Bro.

The Academy occupiesthree classrooms and a Principal's office inthe Courthouse. The premises are convenient,but not sufficient for the large attendanceduring the winter. It is said that within a short time the "State House" will be sold atauction. If so that opportunity should not besuffered to pass by in securing it, and not let-ting it go into the hands of our enemies.There is, however, ^throughout the whole Stake^ a very pronounced feeling a-gainst the ^permanent^ location of the Stake Academy atFillmore, they prefer Holden for that end.It will require the advices of President Wood-ruff to guide the people in the solution of theproblem. A Boardmeeting was held in the evening in which it appeared, that Primary Church

 Constantinople, Sept 1st 1898.President Wilford Woodruff and Counsellors,Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A.Dear Brethern, When I last reported to you I was at Sivas. I at once left for Zara to visit the Branch of our church there. I found them very faithful and filled with the love of the Gospel. They were, of course, very anxious to gather, and were very happy in the thought that the Lord would soon open up de liverence for them from bondage. They are not so hard up for food as are the saints in Aintab, but they are more in thraldom which makes life tiresome. The hope which the Gospel gives is their life. Elder Nishan Sheriman presides.He is a faithul man & much beloved of the saints. He is also respected of the outsiders & of the Government. The prospects there are not flattering, a few are investigating. They were very fortunate in not having to go through the massacre. The saints fasted & prayed for seven days when they noticed preparations for slaughter & God heard their prayers & delivered the town from destruction, for which they are very thankful.They plad with me continually to ask the Brethern in Zion not to forget them, that they might also be gathered to some place where they could learn more of the ways of the Lord and help to build up His Kingdom. A circumstance happenedwhile at Zara which impressed me with a new idea about traveling & preaching the Gospel in Turkey. I was for a little while mistaken for an English Consul. From the whole af- 
 F. F. HintzeJune 21 [18]98Sivas, Asia Minor, June 21 [18]98President Wilford Woodruffand CounsellorsSalt Lake City, Utah,Dear Brethern,  June the19th Brother Nishan Sherinian andmyself reached safely this city after arather remarkable expeirience.According to instructions from Apos-tle Lund I started north emediatlyafter his leaving Haifa for Zion.At Beyrout I mailed him someinformation including a map ofEl gere, the villige for sale, all of whichI learn by letter from him has safelyreached him at Islington 42.  As hewill present that part of our workI will not mention it here.May 23rd We arrived at Allepo (Halep)And found President Maycock & ElderLarsen together with the saints well & happy.  During the week we were envi-ted to a discussion with the Catholics 
 -fair I understood that if I were careful to notify my Consul of my intended trip and obtained a Gen I'armefrom the Government, that I could travel & stay at pleasure without trouble. To prove this I determined on a trip to G r newhere I knew the Government did not want any foreigners to go if they could help it. As soon as I arrived at Sivas I turned my pass over to my consul Dr. Jewet who treated me with ^consideration^. He sent it by the Dragoman to the Government who fix it O.K. and gave me a guide. I also asked him to inform the Kaimakam at G r ne of my coming. When I arrived at G r ne I had perfect liberty, was treated with respect by the officials and met only the opposition which our presence always produces with the Protestants. The experiment was a success. It was said that several were ready to be baptized but I did not so find it. There were good peopleand investigators, and probably those who would have been baptized had not the Protestants raised such a storm.Brethern, the breaking loose from this world is hard every where, but it is harder where no political rights are enjoyed. neither have we had any formal acknowledgement from the Government so that we could offer the needed protection. I know we say have faith in the Lord, do right and obey the gospel and let the consequences follow. But that is hard for them to do ^who^ have, as a rule, but little moral force of character. Much less than a century ago they were ignorant priest-ridden Armenians. Now the Protestants have enlightened them alittle. They are far from possessing that courage and stability which our fathers have transmitted to us, and which they possessed long before we heard the Gospel, Many are 
 in an anti chamber of the ChaldeanCatholic church of Aleppo. We excepted theinvitation. And for two evening we werediscussing the question of athe Original Sin.Many were present and we hope muchgood was done, yet you know the Catholicsatre, as a rule, not open to conviction. Itwas more remar^k^able because we wereenvited to a catholic Church. They suposedthe victory easy, but found on the lastend that the question envolved a great dealwhich they could not explain away. Iwas much troubled because I had tospeak through an enterpretor.On May 29th we had the pleasure tobaptize 8 persons. Several were personsof good families.June the first we arrived at Aintab &the following Sunday, fast day, we baptized5 persons, One of whom is ^a^ man of somestanding, his children ^are^ well educated. A-nother leading man is redy to be baptized.The step is a great trial to them. Everyeffort is being made by the Protestantsto hinder new members from joining. 
 honest and good, but thy need the same development as we have to do as we do. They have not inherited the experience, the self reliance nor the development of moral thought & courage that we inherited from our parents, and which is in-creased & intensified in us by the knowledge of the gospel & by the free institutions with which we are invironed.At G r ne I met a Gentleman from Albistan about 75miles south of there. He ^is^ what is called a Campbellite. He was quite interested and told ^me^ of a little church in Albistan which are seeking for truth. But his position was like the others. He asked, are you recognized? I told him no. He urged recognitionas did the others. The dominant churches over tax our people,They annoy them in numerous ways so that to step out to begin anew takes courage. The Zara Aintab & Alepo branches were organized before the lines were drawn so sharply. I therefore earnestly plead with you, my Brethern, that you do all you can for our Brothers and Sisters in GTurkey. In their present condition they will need help continually, but if they can be gathered out to one place they will evidently soon improve as they are smart & apt to adopt new ideas & practices. That you did not at once adopt our report and decide to buy the Gire' property did not suprise me, indeed, had you done so I should have been suprised. But it was all we could seein the short time we were investigating. We were looking more for what we wanted, pr. instructions, than for what we could get.I am now looking for what we can get and where we can get it. My observations will be reported promptly to you from time to time.And if we cannot now locate in the "Jackson County" of Pale-stine, I supose we can go to the "mountains" or some other 
 their houses are visited, All mannerof vile stories are told. The families areshamed down ^& made fierce opposers to the men^ telling them that it wouldbe better that they became Muhammedansor that they should commit some crimeand be inprisoned than to join such anorganization of out laws. They site withsome force the fact that we are not rec-congnized by the Government of Turkey,while this is true it is certainly no crime;still it is being worked to a good advantagewhich you will see by the following accountof our trip north. At Aintab our land-lord has been rather dilatony about fixingup outr room according to agreement &it bothers us some, but he will probablymake it right on the last end. It is notso easy to accomplish just what you wanthere owing to the poor mail & transpor-tation service in this land.  Then maybehe also feels this as we are not recognized weare not very dangerous. Regcogniztion au-thority or a display of power is a great thingin this land of despotism. People are so cowedor bowed down that it is hard for a foreignor to understand. 
 place until we can, and there prepare the people to buildup the Centre Stake in the Orient. We do not need to go so far, All we need to do is to brave the danger of frontier life as we did in Utah, and we can get plenty of Good land & water almost for nothing. Syria is large, but Mesopotania with its ancient water canal systems is empty & iddle. I am told by those who know that there is not finer country in the world, But ^it^ is well inland. Yet Uncle Sam backed by the Lord is good enough for anybody. Since seeing what I have on this trip my language is quite insufficient to express my gra titude to God for America & her institutions, even aside from what I know of the gospel. I shall, however, do nothing except by your authority, but I have not lost hope in the Ottoman Government giving us land on easy terms now that we are not opposed by our own U.S. officials. They used to oppose us now we have their assistance. I am told by Mr. Allaimby U. S. Marshall to Turkey, that the Legation here 10 years ago wentso far as to tell the Porte that we were not acknowledge as a church at home and that they could not protect us. The Portesnubed them nicely by giving them to understand that we would have the same recognition & protection as others. This was most agreable news to me. The Marshall said it was on file at the Legation & if I can secure a copy of it I will send it to you.Mr Allaimby has visited Utah, and has in his possession a letter from President John Taylor. He offered me any needed as-sistance in his power, For which I was thankful.Since coming to Constantinope I have labored with the question of recognition. I move slow & I find it Benificial.Dr. Angel, the Minister received me kindly but left at once 
 After encouraging the saints to faith-fulness at Aintab & having arrangedall matters as best we could we left Presi-dent Maycock & the Saints June the 7thfor [Shusni Mansur] whence we had re-ceived a number of pressing invitationsto come and baptize etc. Our caravanbeing a large one we had no police orsoldier with us. In four days we arrivedsafely & found that the whole town wasin one stir about us and our coming.The wildest rumors about our givingmany wives & much money to all whowould join had deceived many who hadsuch bugs in their brains. Could we havecomplied with their wish we could havedone great business. But when they foundour business of a quite different nature,that we required faith & works, that wereceived from members, tithing etc, & did notgive the whole thing flatened with that crowd.In the mean time we had been visitedby the police, my teskere (pass) & books hadbeen taken to the police station, and a chargeor suspicion had been trumped up by the 
 (second sheet)for the United States. The Charge d'Affaires, Mr JohnRiddle has assited me very willingly. He at once sent a dragoman to the Government ^to find out^ how to proceed in this matter, and finally we were refered to the Minister of Religions, Mr. Ziver Bey. He remembered me from former visits. He explained to us that it was nessesary first to send the petition to Alepo and have it signed by the native Elders of our Church, then to the Vali who would investigate if we had a people there and certify to the findings. Then the petition would come here and be considered by the sublime Porte. This government could not recogni-ze us as we are foreigners but it would consider a petition fromits own citizens. He promised his assistance. He has read and formally excepted the petition with a slight correction and it is now ready to sent to Sivas & Alepo. Please find a copy with thisreport in seperate envelope marked A.Just at the time of getting up this petition I was in a littletrouble how to begin and where to get assistance. Mr. Riddle presented me with a ticket to go to Selamlik, to see the Sultan drive to the Hamidiea Mosque to prayer. I attended and upon my return I was hailed by Brother Binyad, our Greek brother & a sort of lawyer by profession. We were so pleased to meet. After investigating his condition I sent him to find out from some high officials all he could of how we should proceed & he returned a report identical with Ziver Bey's advise. He at once struck up a plan or form which was excepted as above stated.Ziver Bey & the Legation people promised such aid as we would need when the petition comes back. And Mr. Garqiula the Legation enterpreters presence upon each visit gave a greatdeal of force to my position. 
 Protestants & the Government to gather thatwe were agitators. They telegraphed to theMutesarif at Malatia who ordered us sentthere. As a foreingnor I refused to be confirmedor even to acknowledge arrest and it seemsthat they did not dare to handle me roughly.I went in and ^out^ of the police room as I pleased& told them that they could choose one outof two, either let me live at the khan, werewe had a room, until they got ready or sendme at once as I possitively refused to gowillinging into confinement without acharge ^complaint^. They chose to send us at once & in ashort time we were sent out of town, ahorse back at our own expence, under twogaurds to Malatia, Of course we suffereda great deal of indignity from a worldlystandpoint but we were happy. BrotherNishan proved a great healp to me as hewas used to such indignities has advisehad a good effect. My obstainasy saved usfrom further trouble & in two days, wei. e. part of three days travel we were atMalatia. The road, or trail, was of the roughestI ever traveled & still entitlled to the name of 
 As these men at the Legation & General Consulate wouldnot take any backshish for services, I offered them a Book of Mormon as a present from the Church. They seemed very much gratified with the proposition & would except the books with thanks. I have therefore ordered a Book of Mormon for Mr. Garqiula & a Voice of Warning for Mr. Dimitri adus of the General Consulate, from Bern as they desire French.I hope you will approve of this as it is an easy, and may be a benificial way to remember them and to show our appricia-tion of their assistence which we may need much more in the future. The cash expences of the petition will be about five^eight^ Dollars.I called on Mr. Dickensen Consul General To Turkey. He received me very cordially & answered my questions without reserve.He said that America had better treaty rights with turkey than any other nation, and that we were perfectly secure in property holding in Turkey, that is, said he, as secure as ^a^ governmeent like this can make it. He said the Turkish Government lived up to the treaty better than the Americans, & that he was sorry that there were some Americans who seem to think it an honor if they could defy the Turks or say something to offend them under the Juristection of the U.S. Government. Mr. Dimitriadus, the vice Consul & sec. of the Consulate has furnished me a copy of the protocal & enterpretation of our priviledges relating to property rights, and security from interference by Turkish officials. The copy is also made part of this report and is marked B.I would ask these questions. Is the gathering limited to Palestine? And further, Shall I look toward a petition to the Porte for land for our saints if we are successful with the petition for recognition? 
 malil route. Over mountain passes, downwashout's, crossing several ranges thetrail being many places very dangerous.At Malatia we were soon released, ortold there was no change. We were told we werenot arrested but that as the road was unsafe (also true) we were only gaurded fromthe robbers etc. This was a cute explaina-tion. My pass & books had been seized &sent here under double seal. I gave themto understand I quite knew the differencebetween arrest & liberty. It was clearthat we were not entirely free as the Mu-tesarif desierd we should lodge in thebarracks telling us it was better that thefilthy khan. I thanked him but toldhim if I was free I would go to the khana little discussion issued between themselves,and the police commissioner, who proved tobe a gentlemen, came & told us we mightgo to the Khan. They evidently were figuringon some plan to let us go, which is not theeasiest thing in the world in this land wereno one seems to know just what to do es-pecially in cases envolving foreignors. 
 I ask these questions now that I may receive an answer in time to continue my labors when I come back to Constantinople if required. I expect to leave this week for Palestine to see the Gire' property & Palestine in Sept. according to the instructions from Apostle Lund. Afterwards I will go north to Alepo to help the petition work there. And if you think proper I will investigate chances for land in Northern Syria. As for the natives I see no more to fear from themthan we had to fear from the Indians in Utah. There are difficulties but they can be overcome by the Lord's assistance.Go where we will and we shall find difficulties to surmount but if we begin right by sending enough foreigners to our place of settlement to beget confidence & ^to^ establish respect and confidence in the movement we will soon be alright. Aforeign hat is a great power in Turkey.A friend and investigator Mr. Negro, a Polish Gentlemenof fine education & attainments came here as an exile fromPoland. He is now a Turkish subject & has worked for yearsfor them as an ingeneer. He also states that there is plenty of land to be had in Syria & that good tittles can be had. A little backshish is needed. Then let a man who is a citizen & in whom we have confidence buy & imidiately transfer to an American. He has extensive experience in land matters. I became aquainted with him 10 years ago and he seems like and exceedingly good man.In regard to the mission in General I believe it is progressing favorably. The probability of a place of gathering gave a good deal of new life and energy as it does in all countries. This is natural to the Gospel. 
 We left the barracks, however, & went tothe Khan were we found to our surprisethat we had a guard placed over us. Iat once sent a nother soldier to notify thegovernment that I positively objected toany such indignity. The soldier was prompt-ly removed. It was some time before wecould decide washat was coming next. Butit soon dawned on us that the Mustesarifhad telegraphed the Govenorrnor at Kharpootfor instructions. The Vali telegraphed backthat in as much as we were desirous ofgoing to Sivas not to hinder us, but togive me back my books, & examine anyArmenian papers found. This was com-plied with. Our Armenian writings wereendorsed O. K. by the Commissionor.So far so good, but it was not untiltwo days out from Malatia that we werenoright sure that we were not in some un-derhanded way being sent to Sivas. But oneof the Gen I'arneo hwho ackcompanied us wasinduced to show us his papers by speakingof the general method of protecting travelors.This was a great relief to us. As I was all the 
 New hopes have been engendered by this prospects of the realization of the promises to the House of Israel.  I have not heard whether or not Brothers Vizirian and Nadjarian have been released from prison, but they are reported as bearing faithful testamonies in their cell in Diarbekr and they have found believers, Those men are very energetic.I would reco^m^mend that one or two more experienced Elders be sent here. And that each Utah Elder traveling has a native Brother as his assistance. The native Bro-ther to act as interpretor, He can do the preaching, as a rule,better than we. It also helps to put the Utah Elder in good standing before the Government & people. The actual expence of keeping a native Elder is not much. And alone the native can do nothing. The situation has entirely changed since the massacre. Natives are under restrictions all the time & are not safe from arrest unless in the imploy of some foreignor. And Foreingners must put themselfves in a position to hold the respect of the people by the dignity & authority which our treaties and consular aid affords, otherwise we are liable to arrest and much trouble. We hope this condition will soon change but until then we must proceed in some such way to preach the Gospel in Turkey. Turkey is a peculiar country with peculiar laws and customs, & very strange ways of inforcing them as few persons under stand the laws. But if they think you are in Good standing inStamboul or well backed by your own Government they look upon you as Lords. And it is very profitable & convenient to have them continue to think so. A show of superiority seems necessary. The people here must look up to some authority

Nishan should be taken from mein anyway it m^i^g^ht^ prove a heaard case for him, besides hurting his enfluence atZara, his home, where hise is the leadingChristian citizen. We are thankful thatGod delivered us & that at this writing we^have^ passed police examination and all is well.It is awful to think that men whose actsare strickly honest & whose conscience isclear & who try earnestly to comply withthe law of the land shall still fear & trembleat meeting & officer lest something unfore-seen shall turn up and one be mistrusted.At Husni Masur a good and faithfultestomony was left to hundreds. At Ma-latia only little was done beyound destributingtrack. We felt that our liberty depended largelyupon our leaving town soon so we leftat once otherwise we would have been sentto Kharpoot the  Governor's seat and of thecase had been augmented from there toConstantinople. The lower officers at Husni 
 Mansur tryed hard to fix suspicionon my journal. This they could not read& it came back unread. While it is free from anything obnoxious to the Ottoman GovernmentYet it contains much important matterpertaining to our special mission whichmight for a while have put me in ^a^ wronglight & done us injury. but all is now well.This trap was set by the College people atAintab of whom Bro. Lund will tell you.they have notified their preachers near& narefar of our intentions of visiting theircities. They have been instructed to notify thecity authorities that we are sedicious & un-recognized therefore have not rights.Theis was a smart trick. We have beentold the whole scene by Army officers & others who deplored our fate but could nothelp us. Now that it is over it is clearto me that the time is ripe for an ap-plication to become recognized. This ex-perience wisely used will furnish anexcelent-opening wedge. Not as a complaintbut as a reason to our Minister at Con-stantinople to whom I hold a special

If we try to be their equals, as the Gospel teaches, and as we would naturally like to be, we destroy our influence, To the members we may be what the Gospel teaches, but to the others we must appear above.I thank you for the appropriation fo the schools in Turkey. At Zara a young sister is instructing the children of the saints & it works very well. I have not heard ^what^ is being done at Aintab aboout the school.Bread has gone up at Constantinope and it is possible our Saints at Aintab will have to be assisted as they will undoubtedly be short of food when winter comes.Work is so poor that it seems at best as though it would keep no one. They manage, however, if they can only find work. I think the saints in Livas & Zara will not suffer.The crops are good there, bread is cheap & work better than at Aintab. The saints at Haifa continue the same.Sister Hilt continues unwell I am sorry to say. She is the soul of that branch.Personally I am well as I believe President Maycock & Elder Larsen are. Individually I feel well in the Gospel & take great pleasure in my labors. Yet I confessthat the trial to leave home & family has been much greater this time than ever before. And then I feel a great responsibility connected with this whole mission. So long as I had the pleasant copmpany and advise of Apostle Lund I was all right but now I feel lost often 
 in these ever changing conditions.In conclusion I would ask you kindly to write me a few lines to Alepo c/o Dr Arminag.That I may know your wish about some of these important questions.  Also that President Wells be notified of the monies we are allowed from time to time so that we will meet with no trouble in obtaining them when needed.

 Provo City, November 11, [189]1President Wilford Woodruff.Chairman General Board of Education.Dear Brother,In compliance with your isntructions concerning myeducational tour to the church schools in Arizona, Ihave written to the each of the Presidents of Snow-flake, St. Johns, St. Joseph, and Maricopa Stakes,placing myself at their disposal during the timeof my stay in their respective Stakes to fill anyappointments they should deem proper to makefor me in the interest of our church schools, ReligionClasses, Sunday schools, & M.

 Two new Seminaries have been reported to have beenorganised with the sanction of their respectiveStake Boards.  The first is at Escalante, Gar-field County, for which, by request, I have nom-inated this day Bro. Martin I. Bushman, a Normalof the B. B. Y. Academy.  The second is at WestJordan, Salt Lake Co. As I have not yet beenofficially notified by that Local Board, butonly by Counsellor Jos. E. Taylor in privateconversation, I cannot make a definite appoint-ment, but have selected in my mind Bro.Eugene Hart, of Bloomington, Idaho.  Bro. Hart wasuntil recently a teacher on the Bear Lake Stake Ac-ademy, Paris, but had to discontinue with theother teachers, except the Principal, on accountof the financial embarrassment of that in-stitution.Ever praying for the blessings of theLord to rest upon you, I remainWith kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G.

 Provo, September 12th [189]1President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Bro. James E. Talmage has just now left me after explainingto me your approval of the plan of having ^gotten up^ a series of textbooksfor the three grades of religions instructions in our Churchschools,Sundayschools, Primaries [et. et.] When Bro. Talmage first sugges-ted this idea to me, I saw at once the great benefits that wouldprobably be derived from such a step, in as much as I haverealized for a long time the want of a religious textbookconstructed upon correct Normal principles. Hence myenthusiastic endorsement of the Sunday school Leaflets,the first real step in that direction. With great joy I learned,therefore, of your approval of Bro. Talmage's plan, which hehad laid before you upon my suggestion. Consideringalso the many difficulties which the introduction of theReligion-Classes is encountering in some Stakes, amongwhich the want of proper methods is the most promin-ent, the publishing of suitable textbooks would removemany objections that have been raised against thiswise move of the First Presidency. The ReligiousClasses is a supplement ^and effect^ to the secularisation of our district-schools have become a necessity in 
 those Stakes of Zion, or Bishop's Wards, where theschools are in the hands of the opponents to theLatterday Work, and where Sunday schools and Primaries, can with these new textbooks as guides,would prove too feeble bulwarks against the flood-of evil influences bearing down upon our childrenduring the whole working school directed by inmany cases professionally efficient teachers ^but opposed to our faith^. In someStakes also noble work has already been donein those Religion-Classes, promising a further de-velopment, especially when assisted by those booksin contemplation, the results of which cannot bemeasured by human calculation.The question of authorship appears to me verysimple as for the qualification is concerned, inas much as we have no educational author thusfar among as equal to Dr. James E. Talmage.If he shall find time for this work depends en-tirely upon the direction of the First Presidency.I shall take great pleasure in rendering all possibleassistance in this work, but Bro. Talmage ought tobe the man to do it.I have looked over with Bro. Talmage the manu-script for Gen. Circ. No. 7, and approve fully of his suggestions.Bro. Woodbury has been recalled to Farmington andwill see that your daughter Mary gets there also. Hestaid with me here yesterday.With kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser. 
 Provo City, April 13. [189]1President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In conversations held separately with Bros. Howard andSeeley, Counselars of President Larson of Emery Stake, duringConference, and by letters from Bro. Eli A. Day, Principal of theirStake Academy, I discovered such a hopeless case of disunionexisting in the Stake Board of Education, that steps leadingto an improvement in this state of affairs become imperative.Both Principals, the one of the Stake Academy at Castle Dale, andthe other of the Seminary at Huntington are completely discouraged.The latter has quit already and has gone home, and the formerwants to quit at the end of this term, and intends to attend^ the NormalCourse at the B.Y. Academy for a term or two, if he shallget a chance.  He has been arrested again during Confer-ence on the ongoing charge, having served already a term inthe pen.  It appears from all that I can learn, that theold jealousy between Huntington and Castle Dale, especiallyon the part of the former place, led by Bros. Howard andJohnson, is handicapping all the operations of the StakeBoard, of which Bro. Howard is the nominal President.Bro. Larsen, the Stake President, being no member of the Boardat all on account of some mistaken modesty of his. 
 As this is a matter concerning Board affairs I have no authorityto give instructions, but report the case to you. Counselor Seelyimplored me to see that something be done, and I promised himthat I would lay this case before for you, so that relief fromthis strained condition of affairs could be obtained.With kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser1. P.S. Bros Geo. W. Ingram, of Mesa, and Geo. A. Crosby, of St. George,have been placed on the Beneficiary list of the Normal Dept. ofthe B.Y. Academy for next year, as director, and been dulynotified of the fact.K.G.M.2. P.S. I enclose letter from Randolph which explains itself.What and how shall I answer Bro. Larsen?KGM.

 Provo City, January 19th [189]2President Wilford WoodruffDear Brother,At an official visit I paid yesterday to the BrighamYoung Academy, taking notes, attending the recitations ofthe teachers, and meeting with the Faculty after schoolin special session, of which proceedings I shall makedue report to you in connection with my report of mysouthern circuit commencing with today I foundthat all the teachers of the Brigham Young Academy,teaching academic studies, are using officially the title"Professor" on the bulletin-boards and elsewhere inthe Academy. As this is against the rule adopted bythe General Board of Education, laid down in GeneralCircular No. 7, page 5, I objected to this at the Faculty-meeting. None of these teachers, except Professor Cluff,who has his Diploma, holds even a License for theseacademic studies. Several of them have handed to melast night their applications for Licenses in their re-spective academic studies, endorsed by Prof. Cluff asPrincipal. I have filled out blanks accordingly andsubmit them herewith respectfully for your con-sideration. These teachers solicit the permission of 
 nan 
 the General Board to use the title "Professor" on thestrength of these Licenses, as they are ready to passtheir examination for the "Academic Degree" nextspring.According to your instructions to submit myopinion on all pending questions in Church Schoolmatters, I venture to state, that this question does notconcern the teachers of the Brigham Young Academyalone, but can be applied to the Colleges at Salt Lake and Logan as well. The granting of therequest of the B.Y.A. teachers would necessitate,therefore, some modification of the paragraphin the Gen. Circ. No. 7, above alluded to.I shall return from Fillmore to Provo, Friday,Jan. 29th, when I should be pleased to receiveany instructions from you on this point, orcan call on you any day between January 30 andFebruary 1st.With kind regardsYour brother in the Gospel,Karl G.

 Provo City, March 2d [189]2President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,According to program submitted in my letter to Bro. Reynolds,January 15, I have visited in the interest of our Church SchoolOrganization the Stakes of Juab, Millard, Emery, Sanpete, and Sevier from January 19 until February 26; attended during that period the Stake Academies at Nephi, Fillmore, Castle Dale,Ephraim, and Richfield, and the Seminaries at Hunting-ton, Manti, and Gunnison, spending in each of these schools one whole day, from the opening exercises in the morning until the closing exercises in the afternoon; taking notes, examining the the records required in Gen. Circ. No 7, page 17;met with the respective Faculties for consultation; and met also with the Stake and the Local Boards to ascertain the condition of their general affairs.  Appointments by the Stake Superindendents for me to address public meetings were made at Nephi, Fillmore, Meadow, Kanosh, Deseret, Scipio, Holden, Huntington, Castle Dale, Ferron, Orangeville,Ephraim, Manti, Gunnison, and Richfield, at all of which occasion our Church Schools and Religion Classes werethe leading subjects; Sunday Schools, Primaries, and MutualImprovement Associations, as corroborate institutions, re-

 ceiving due attention in all my public addresses.The school's, without one exception, have been betterpatronized than the previous year and a marked progress toward permanency is observable in all of them.  The only drawback is the financial embarrass-ment under which some of them are laboring yet.There is one feature, however, to which I take the liber-ty of calling the attention of the General Board for the earliest possible consideration viz:  The annual change of Principals in many of our Church Schools, in con-sequence of which such schools can never ^hope to^ emerge out of the experimental stage and to reach a leading po-sition ahead of the District Schools at least not to a very pronounced degree.  The main reason is the comparatively poor salary, and the absence of any pro-spective improvement in this regard, forcing us to supply these schools every year or so with new be-ginners, as their predecessors are compelled to seek for better chances elsewhere.  A proposition has suggested itself to my mind which, if it can be car-ried out, might circumvent this difficulty.  I should suggest an addition to any Principal's salary after five years' service in one school, and so on after every five yearsmore until a stipulated maximum should be reached.With kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser, Gen Supt

 Provo City, March 21st [189]1President Wilford WoodruffDear Brother,Last Thursday morning I presented the two letters to Pres. A. O. Smoot andto Bro. George Cluff respectively.  The latter intends acknowledging the recieptof his letter forth with, but with the former some very earnest conversationensured, a report of the main features of which I herewith respectfullysubmit. Calling at Pres. Smoot's office Thursday morning after mailtime,I found him and Bros. D. John and H. H. Cluff, a waiting me being,it appears, privately advised by Bro. B. Cluff that some important com-munication was to be made to them.  After the reading of your letter,feeling began to run very high, and the message of Pres. Geo. Q. Cannondelivered by me verbatim did not seem to carry any conviction withit.  The arguments of the Bretheren of thie Stake Presidency was as fol-lows:  1. Whenever a young man of talent had been made an efficientteacher in the B.Y. Academy, he had been taken away, the school leftin a crippled condition until some  one else became qualified to be taken away in his turn, vide Bros. Tanner, Talmage, Maeser, andnow Cluff. 2. The B. Y. Academy were the mother institution of our churchschools the most of whom were conducted by Graduates of this insti-tution; she had proved her integrity to the First Presidency and to wholeIsrael, and it would not be wise to break down a welltriedinstitution for the sake of building up an experimental one.

Smoot's office Thursday morning after mailtime.I found him and Bros. D. John and H.H. Cluff awaiting me beingit appears, privately advised by Bro. B. Cluff that some important com-munication was to be made to them.  After the reading of your letterfeeling began to run very high, and the message of Pres. Geo. Q. Cannondelivered by me verbatim did not seem to carry any conviction withit the arguments of the Brothern of this Stake Presidency some as fol-lows:  1.  Whenever a young man of talent had been made an efficientteacher in the B.Y. Academy, he had been taken away, the school leftin a crippled condition until some one else became qualified to be taken away in his turn, [vide] Bros. Tanner, Talmage, Maeser, andnow Cluff.  2.. The B.Y. Academy were the mother institution of our churchschools the most of when were conducted by Graduates of this ins-tution; she had proved her integrity to the First Presidency and to [whole]Israel, and it would not be wise to break down a welltriedinstitution for the sake of building up an experimental one. 
 nan 
 3.  That just now arrangements had been made, donations raisedfrom public sources with intentions been published for the enlarge-ment of the Commercial Department and the establishment of a"Kindergarten" in connection with the B. Y. Academy.  4. That thedeeds and consequences of the real estate were now in the hands ofthe Board of Trustees, and that the latter had receised very encouragingassurances from all the leading businessmen of Provo, in andout of the Church, to support them in their efforts to dispose ofreal estate at once, and finish the new Academy-building, butthat all these efforts would be frustrated, as soon this new blowat the prosperity of the institution would become known.  That thepeople would say there were no use trying to do anything here,for the Authorities at Salt Lake wouldwill continue to take alwaysour best men away.I suppose that the Board of Trustees will meet here next week,when it is intended to have your letter discussed and answeredofficially.  My report is merely for the purpose of posting you inregard to the prevailing sentiments here in regard to this matter.Not sharing myself the spirit of despondency in this case, but seeing that I could make no impression upon the Stake Presi-dency, I invited all the teachers of the B. Y. Academy to a privateconsultation at my office, yesterday afternoon.  Except Bro. B. Cluff,all were present and each expressed his determination to standby the Academy now, although the most had intended to re-sign at the end of the schoolyear before anything of thecontemplated change was known.  They desi[re] that President 
 Provo City, May 26th [189]1President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In as much as the time for our Annual Church SchoolConvention is near at hand, it becomes my duty to submitto you a few suggestions for your consideration to instructmembers of the General Board present at the occasion to bringwhat extent they might bring before the Convention anyor all of them, or other points of importance which youmay desire to have them speak upon.1. It has been noticed with regret that several ChurchSchools have not yet made arrangements that the copies of theJuvenile Instructor, containing the "Church School Papers",are kept on file for reference, in consequence of which omis-sion many of our Church School Teachers are kept in ignoranceof this content.2. As the Religion-Classes are an appendage to ourChurch School Organization, and as such are underthe control of the respective Stake Boards of Educa-tion, and the Principal of the Stake Academy, whereaspracticable, should act as Stake Superintendent overthese classes, but the majority of our Religion-Class-Instructors are not professional teachers, all our 
 nan 
 continuedWoodruff would kindly permit the B. Y. Academy to use Bro. Mae-ser's name for next year as Principal, and that Pres. Smoot be re-quested to secure the services of Bro. Geo. Brimhall, Principal ofthe Provo District Schools, as teacher for the Normal Department.With these arrangements being granted, they were willing to laboron at any sacrifice for the sake of bridging over the trying positioninto which their dear Academy were just now placed.  They all havereceived their training, spiritual and mental, in the Academy,and owed this debt of gratitude to her.  There was much emotionexhibited in that meeting.Last night I had a private interview with Pres. Smoot at hisresidence, by appointment.  By representing to him the fact that theB. Y. Academy had passed through many and severe struggles,among which the ordeal of fire was not the least, and had beengaining in spite of all that in influence and usefulness, andhad manifestly enjoyed the approval of the Lord and HisServants, she would continue to hold her own as long her Boardand Faculty would keep in the line of the Spirit of the Gospel.I told Bro. Smoot that the First Presidency were loyal to theB. Y. Academy, and that, in establishing a much needed Univer-sity at Salt Lake, for the purpose of eventually stopping thatpernicious annual exodus of our young people to  Eastern 
 regular Church-School-Teachers should render us allpossible assistance in the further development ofthat great work.3. It is very desirable that a report of the complete or-ganization of these Religion Classes should be receivedfrom every stake of Zion on or before Sept. 15.4. Many of our "District-Conventions" have passedthrough the experimental stage, and are in goodworking order. Several Branch Conventions havebeen organized for the greater convenience offar off members, and promise to become soonindependent District-Conventions. As the officeof Chairman of Convention has been found todevelop into one of great responsibility, it is thoughtbest that the General Board should reserve ^to itself^ thenominations for that office.5. Attention is called on it more to the instructions givenin our General Circulars that no branches of studiesshould be announced in Church School Annuals,was placed into the Curriculum, for which thereis not ^properly^ licensed or certificated teacher in thatschool. This rule applies also to Normal Classes inStake Academies.6. The unprecedented development of our Church SchoolsOrganization recalls to mind the ia discussion in theGeneral Board of Education preceding the issuanceof one of the General Circulars, when it was understood 
 High Schools, it was not intended to interfere in the least with the noble mission which the B. Y. Academy was performing. TheFirst Presidency had called away, it is true, thus far the leadingteachers from the Academy, but simply for the reason that therehad been no others available at the time, and not for thereason of keeping down the Academy. Bro. Smoot feels somewhat more encouraged, and instructed me to see Bro. Brimhall forthe purpose above alluded to.In connection with this B. Y. Academy affair, I beg leave to callyour attention also to the B. Y. College at Logan. Bro. JM. Tanner has an-nounced his intention to go East after the close of the schoolyear,and study also for a year or two as Bros. Talmage and Cluff havedone in order "to be even with them". Now, there is the AgriculturalCollege at Logan with its financial advantages gaining influenceand power in ever increasing ratio. The B. Y. College  must notbe suffered to be swamped by that Gentile Institution, which itcertainly would be, if Bro. Tanner, who has been working upa fine spirit among the young people there, leaves and no suitableman to continue the work. Suitable is only one that comes withan already established reputation. There are hundreds of youngmean in Israel that will be in a short time just as good andprobably better than any ofthe present known Educatorsamong the Latterday Saints, but they have to make theirreputation first. I have no one to suggest as suitable to carryon the work, if Bro. Tanner should leave this year. If youcould induce Bro. Tanner to stay one more year the difficulty 
 continuedby the members present that it would take about fiveyears before our contemplated standard of efficiencycould be reached. Two of these five years have nowpassed, and although much has been accomplished,a by far greater work is yet bifore us to attend to. Amongthe many problems awaiting solution is the one thatrequires all desirous of occupying the high responsibilityof Principal of a Stake Academy to hold the "AcademicDegree." It is to be hoped that this point can be reachedwithin the remaining three years.7. The permanency of the position of Principal is anotherpoint of vital importance, the attainment of which noBoard of Education can afford to lose sight of.Not only is the annual change in the Principalshipdeterimental to the best interests of the school in thespecial instances, but ^also^ has a tendency of lowering thestartndard of the whole profession, in not giving securityto talented persons for permanent homes and for thecreation of personal influences for golasting good in anygiven locality.8. Fully realizing the financial difficulties the mostof our Boards of Education have to contend with, 
 continuedmay ^be^ successfully met.A very similar case presents itself at the Millard Stake Acad-emy, Fillmore. President I. N. Hinckley has obtained from GovernorThomas the use of the "State House" at Fillmore, and is now engaged withhis Brothern to secure the building for a long term of years by awell fortified Lease. This move will require some extra financial ex-ertion on the part of the Saints in that Stake, but just at this junc-ture, Bro. Josiah Hickman, the Principal of the Stake Academy, intendsto resign for the purpose of taking a higher course at the L.D.S. College.I bound myself by my word to him last year, not to raise any objec-tion to his leaving this year, if he would hold on another year, asI had no suitable successor then, Bro. Hickman having done asplendid work down there and became the idol as it were of hisBoard, Students, and the People. That makes it very difficult for anyone to follow after such a man, for everything he does or say willbe measured by the standard of his predecessor. Pres. Hinckleyrequested me to use my influence with Bro. Hickman to remain an-other year until the S. Academy should be fairly started in thenew building. As my word had been given to the contrary,I could not do so, but Bro. Hickman will abide by your counselin the matter. He will call on you on the subject.There is a great deal of diffidence on the part of [several] 
 the General Board, nevertheless, can not urge earnestlyenough the necessity of having the services of every Prin-cipal at least secured for the whole schoolyear, thatis 40 weeks. For, if this cannot be done, we willbe beaten in the long run. The District School Servicesis only too anxious to secure our best teachers by offersof pecuniary remuneration exceeding ours by far,and asking for less efficiency. We would onlyeducate teachers practically for two or three years,in order to turn them over as experienced teachers intothe District School Service. Teachers cannot be askedto labor always on missionary rates, or fill outthe balances of the year with other occupations tomake both ends meet.9. It is very desireable that the Stake Presidents should bepresiding over the Stake Boards of Educations wheneverpracticable, and that noone ^member^ should continue hismembership in such a Board that is not willing toput forth his energies for the advancement ofthe respective school.10. It has come to the notice of the General Boardthat the interests of our educational movementare greatly interfered with in some Stakes bylocal jealousies. Wherever this spirit has shown itselfit has proven itself antagonistic to the true interestin Zion.11. There is no Stake Board of Education in Cache Stakeof Zion. The Board of Trustees of the B. Y. College at 
 Stake Presidents in regard to the introduction of these "ReligionClasses", and one, President Smith of Davis Stake, told me atFarmington during the meeting, Sunday afternoon, that they didnot need these classes in Davis Stake.Questions have been asked me from many sides, ifthese Instructors in the Religion Classes, should not beset apart for their mission by their Bishopric? AlthoughI am of the opinion that they should be, I had no authorityto give such instruction. If this should be your mind, pleaseto instruct me accordingly, that I could put it into the next"Church School Papers."With kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser 
 continuedLogan is composed in its majority of Brethren not be-longing to the Stake, I understand. As the Religion-Classesare under the direction of a "Stake Board of Education"some provision should be made in this regard.12. As the Principals of the Stake Academies at BrighamCity, ^and^ Ephraim, and also hold no Academic Diplomas as yet,but these Academics have appropriations for JuniorNormal Classes, in what moment can these Principalsbe authorized to teach those classes? This pointneeds some adjustment in order to bring it inharmony with our general instructions.13. Bros. Moench in Ogden, and Hickman in Fillmore have also carried on for several yearsquite successfully some normal instructions, andraised a number of good district-school-teachers.It would prove almost disastrous to these two insti-tutions to discontinue that work for the future.No provisions for the examination in a course inPedagogy have been made as yet, pending theinstructions on the subject by the General Board inthe revised edition of the General Circulars. Whatis to be done in these two cases for the time being 
 I should suggest an "Annual License" for allof these Principals, pending thesie examination forthe "Academic Degree" in "Pedagogy", next year.14. In compliance with the instructions of Gen Circ. No. 5.I reminded Bro. Moench in a letter of May 14, of thenecessity of completing his examination in Drawing,Music, & Logic in the Intermediate Grade which hehad not done last year, thus not getting a Percentagein "General Efficiency." I also suggested to him theadvisability of preparing himself for the "AcademicDegree," as it became necessary for such an importantplace as Ogden to have its Church Academy presided overby a regular "Professor" by and by. This I wrote in anofficial letter, of which the copy is on file. In consid-eration, however, of the long and faithful services ofBro. Moench, I wrote him also a private letter ofencouragement and explanation. All this Bro. Moenchhas answered by enclosed letter. I am in favor ofBro. Moench being granted his full papers for theIntermediate Grade without any further examinationby order of the General Board, in consideration of hislong and faithful services. But the "Academic Degree"he should obtain in the prescribed course of pro-ceedings. Please return his letter to me withyour instructions.15. From several directions have propositions beenmade by Church School Teachers to organize into aregular body for mutual support, to which endthey ask for the privilege of electing a Committee 
 Provo City, November 6, [189]0President Wilford Woodruff,Dear Brother,Since the opening of the present academic year, I have visited theChurchschools in Emery, Sanpete, Juab, Utah, and Salt Lake Stakes. In thefirst one of these, I found the Seminary at Huntington, James E. Brown,Principal, in a very satisfactory condition, there were already in the fourthweek of its organization 42 pupils, all of the IV and V Reader Grades inattendance. No Lady-Teacher as yet, but called for since then, and willarrive there, probably next week. Large attendance anticipated for thewinter season. Bro. Brown is a great favorite with the people & stake.Academy at Castle Dale, Bro. Eli A. Day, Principal, has only 16 stu-dents. Bro. Day was not sufficiently familiar with our system, but is afaithful and hardworking teacher. I parted him soon and madearrangements with him and Bro. Brown to meet often and harmo-nize their labors. Both schools in that Stake have separate housesto meet, Huntington ^Seminary^ being somewhat more conveniently fixedthan the Stake Academy at Castle Dale. Both Boards are current-ly working for the good of their respective schools.In Sanpete I had the pleasure in visiting at the inauguration of the Seminary at Manti, Andrew C. Nelson, Principal,of the Seminary at Gunnisan, Joseph Y. Jensen, Principal, [2]Manti Seminary  opened with 76 students and miss [Hon]

 as lady-teacher.  The school is well furnished, occupies two commo-tions classrooms in a house within the Tabernacle-enclosure, and wasin fine working order the second day after the inaugaration.  TheGunnison Seminary occupies the Relief Society House, and opened with28 students but with fair prospects of large increase.  An upper roomis being rapidly put into shape for [days purposes] Both principalsof these institutions are earnest and [illegible] expect most school-wor-kers and are endeavering to ma[ke] [3 illegible words] actions perma-nent intending to settle down this [illegible 3 words].The Stake Academy at Ephraim [Alm]a Greenwood Principal,has opened with about 25 students [illegible] of the of the Inter[med]iat and Academic Grades, with expectations of a large attendance duringthe coming winter.  Bro. Greenwood is assisted by Bro. Wm.Winter.  The Stake board owns a large building, occupied atpresent by the District school, but wont take possession nextyear. The course of studies in the Academy is very creditable tothe teachers, both in regard to the spirit, methods, and organiza-tion, as well as to the results.The Mt. Pleasant Seminary, Bro. Geo. Christensen, Principal,and Miss Augusta Erickson, Assistant, has opened its secondschool year with but 24 students, of the Intermediate andPreparatory Grades, occupying at present only one classroomBro. Christensen being one of our best churchschool-teachers,exercises a most beneficent influence over the youth of Mt.Pleasant, and it is only to be feared, that the Authorities theremay overload him with too many appointments, on the 
 continuedprinciple of the "willing ox".  Although the Local Board atManti will have a schoolhouse of its own in another year, when theboard of the School-Trustees expires, some assistance will become ne-cessary, in as much as the Presbyterians are erecting a beautifulAcademy-building, and propose to fit it up with all the appur-tenances of modern education in order to swamp our Seminary.All the Boards of Education in Sanpete, with Pres. Peterson at theirhead, and strongly supported by Apostle Lund, are doing theirutmost to advance the cause of their youth.The Juab Stake Academy, at Nephi, Bro. Wm. H. Jones, Principal, andMiss Mattie Nelson, Assistant, opened Oct. 13. with 37 students intwo Departments, Intermediate and Primary.  The house is well-furnished and reflects much credit upon the energy and goodjudgement of the Stake Board.  The people of Nephi seem to be in earnest to support their churchschool.  Bro. Jones is getting quitereadily into line with our educational system, in which he is ablysupported by Mrs. Nelson, who is as Graduate of the B. Y. A. familiarlady with it.  The attendance at that Academy has increasedconsiderable since opening.The L.D.S. College 18 Ward Seminary, 14 Ward Seminary,and Central Seminary at the Cottonwoods, have also beenvisited by me and found in a flourishing condition.  These 
 four institutions of Salt Lake Stake had a full attendance at the first day of opening, so that many more refused admittance forwant ofo room.  I should suggest that at least two more Seminariesbe organized in S.L. City, one in the northwest and one in thesoutheast, and then another one somewhere over Jordan inthe southwestern part of the county, or at Draper.The new Seminary organized at Parowan, and opened Oct. 13.with Bro Edwin Cutler, Principal, reports very favorable progressand the people of that place seem to be determined to supporttheir own churchschool with all their might.Many causes have combined this year to create a considerableiregularity in the time of opening of our churchschools, and inthe applications for teachers, through which circumstances I havebeen placed several times into very perplexing situations. Withthe help of the Lord, however, these difficulties have been over-come thus far, and all our schools with the exception ofSpringville and Kaysville, are now in working order,Al all together.At a meeting of the Stake Board at Ephraim the question was raised, if donations should be given rather to the Stake Academyrather to the Temple.  I had no authority to give an answer, andsubmit it, therefore, to your decision.  It also was proposedat that occasion to divide the appropriation from theGeneral Board with some Seminary, which is also submittedhere with.An objection to lady-students opening or closing the school 
 continuedwith prayer, when students holding the Priesthood are present,has been raised by one of the Principals.  As I have never madeany distinction in this regard between male and female stu-dents but have called on them from the list of volunteersfor this purpose, I desire to be corrected, if I have been wrong inthis.In conformity with the motion carried at the last session ofthe General Board to organize our ^#1^churchschools into "District-Conventions" for the purpose of mutual improvement of our teach-ers and of the establishment of greater uniformity in the methodsof teaching, I have proceeded in starting this movement; andorganized "Districts" recording their geographical position asfollows:1. "Idaho District," comprising the churchschools at Oakley,Preston, Malad, Rexburg, Paris, and Randolph, with Bro.John H. Miles as temporary chairman, pending a permanentorganization, which will have to determine, times and placeof meeting, program, and appointments.2. "Weber District," comprising the churchschools at Brigham,Ogden, Morgan, and Coalville, with Bro. L. F. Moench as tem-porary chairman, under above stated regulations.3.  "Central District"  comprising the churchschools at 
 Heber, Provo, Springville, Nephi, and Fillmore, with Bro. B. Cluffas chairman. This district has already permanently organized,and holds its first regular session, Saturday Nov. 8, at Provo.4. "Salt Lake District", comprising the L.D.S. College, 18 Ward,14 Ward, and Central Seminaries, Davis Stake Academy, andKaysville Seminary. This district is also permanently organizedwith Bro. J E. Talmage as Chairman. First session was held atthe College, Saturday, Nov. 1. Committees on Program and on Ap-pointments were made.5. "Sanpete District," comprising the churchschools at Hun-tington, Castle Dale, Mt. Pleasant, Ephraim, Manti, and Gunnison,with Bro. Alma Greenwood, as permanent Chairman. Theyare permanently organized, meet monthly at Ephraim or Manti alternately, and their Program is also arranged.6. "Mountain District" comprising the churchschools atRichfield, Fremont, and Panguitch, with Bro. A. R. Cutler astemporary chairman. No report as yet.7. "Southern District" comprising the churchschools in Beaver,Parowan, Cedar, and St. George, with Bro. M. H. Dalley as tempo-rary chairman. They will meet next week to effect a perma-nent organization.8. "Arizona District" comprising the churchschools atSt. Johns, St. Joseph, and Snowflake, with Bro. J. W. Brown astemporary Chairman. No report as yet.In consequence of the very scattered condition of someof those "Districts", as for instance of Idaho and Arizona 
 continued.I have suggested to them to meet perhaps only once a year fora whole week or so, when I should endeaver to meet with thembut that they should fill "written appointments" from time totime. Other "Districts" like the "Mountain District", No. 6.might meet quarterly, but the rest will probably meet monthly.I have suggested to them all that, in making up their programs,they should keep in mind the practice in writing Essays, deliver-ing Discourses and Lectures, Practical Exercises in Objectlessons,Classdrills, Demonstrations on different Methods, Questions and[An]swers, and Reports of their respective schools, and Critics.It has also been suggested that some kind of an organ of communication in regard to the doings of these various "Dis-trict Conventions" for the benefit of all under my editorshipbe selected, and the "Deseret News", the "Juvenile Instructor",and the "Contributor" have been named in this connection.I should be grateful to recieve your instruction on thispoint.In conformity with my calendar of travel through the IdahoDistrict, Coalville, and Heber back to Provo, from Nov. 12 toDec. 132, as submitted to you through Bro. Reynolds, I shallbe at Salt Lake City, Wednesday, Nov. 12, and should be glad, ifPres. Thos Ricks could wait for me until then, so that I could 
 go with him Thursday morning directly to Rexburg, as per ap-pointment. Bro. Ricks will be at Salt Lake next Saturday I under-stand.Pres. A. O. Smoot has informed me that a new Board ofTrustees of the B. Y. Academy has been formed and that I ama member of that Board. All the heirs of the B. Y. Estate havetransferred their claims upon this Board (two excepted), and thenew Board is to meet next Tuesday, Nov. 11. at 10 A.M. to de-liberate upon the feasibility of disposing of real estate be-longing to the Academy, for the purpose of raising meanswherewith the erect the Academy building at the north-end of Provo.Begging your pardon for this lengthy but necessaryreport I remainYour brother in the Gospel,Karl G.

 Provo City, July 1st [189]3President Wilford Woodruff.Dear BrotherBro. Geo. Reynolds' letter of yesterday, enclosing Elder B. Cluff's of the day previous, has been taken into careful consideration.In connection with the subject in hand I enclose Bro. Cluff's letter to me the wording of which seem to convey to me a some-what different shade of meaning from the one contained in the letter to you.  While in the letter to you besides the churchschool education in general, particular stress is laid upon the normal training in the Brigham Young Academy, in the letter to me the "advantages of the Acad-emy" without quedifiation are only mentioned.When we remember the special efforts which the First Presidency is now making through circular letters to all the Stakes of Zion in instructing them to send eligible young people to Provo for normal training in Sunday SchoolWork, M.

 Provo, December 10.  [189]2President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In conformity with the approved program, I left for the first circuit of the present schoolyear for Price station on the D. R. G. Ry, Oct 17, where I was received by a convey-ance from Huntington and taken to the latter place the same afternoon. Pres. Larsen, of Emery Stake, having made the necessary appointments for my labors in his stake,I had to leave for Castle Dale early the next morning, in order to be there at the opening exercises at the Academy.The Principal, Bro. Alexander Jameson, is an earnest workeralthough in some branches somewhat below the average qualifications, but diligently endeavoring to make up his deficiencies. Unfortunately the payment of his salary is very irregular on account of the financial condition of the Academy, and he is obliged to own a little store besides for the support of his family. This is in-jurious to the influence of the Academy, and at the end of the present acad. year other arrangements in this regard must be made.  In a conjoined meeting of the Religionclass Instructors, Sunday School, and M. I. Association Officers, I took occasion to refer 
 credit to their intellectual and spiritual advancement from our churchschools it seems to me that the Lord is pleased with the educational state of affairs in Zion thus far, and if necessity for further efforts should arise, He would make it known to you in His own way.  To send out teachers from one single institution exclusively might have a tendency to arouse jealousy in others and to break upthat harmony of labor to a common end without which the Spirit of the Gospel cannot be enjoyed.In regard to the Church School Convention and ex-amination of teachers in Arizona, I shall notify all par-ties concerned, that all these exercises will commence the day after the closing of the conjoined conference, and continue the balance of the week.  Please to let me know the date of the conjoined conference.With the daily prayers for your full recovery, I re-main,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser

Alonzo Wall, is a faithful and de-voted teacher, but as the Seminary is running only 12 1/2 terms in the year, he also is obliged to support him-self and family with outside labor, mostly farming. This Seminary is in a far better condition, in attendance as well as in general standing than the Stake Academy.The members of the Local Board are interested in their school and are making great efforts to run the school the full year in future. Bro. Jameson as well as Bro. Wall held their District Convention, attended by many Sunday School Teachers, mostly, and the Religion Classes throughout the Stake are reported in good working order.Uintah Stake.Left Huntington Thursday, Oct. 20, for Price station where I was met by Bro.

He is a very efficient young man both spiritually and intellectually, and bids fair to build up the educational interest in that part of the count4y to high standard. The school is filled already to its utmost capacity, and an Assistant will have to be engaged, which will necessity an enlargement of the building. The Board owns the house.

This disappoint-ment was caused by the bad and horrible roadbetween Vernal and Price, compelling us to travel three days instead of two, thus disarranging my program by one day. Bro. Edward M Webb, the Principalof the Academy, had not yet commenced his labors to my great regret. It appears that Bro. Webb had concluded to quit teaching altogether and that only a short time ago the Board succeeded in inducing him to resume his labors. Bro. Webb is a fine teacher but thoroughly discouraged for financial reasons, having a large family to support. Meetings for S. S. Teachers, M. I. A. Officers, Primary teachers, & Religionclass In-structors in the forenoon, for the Public in the af-ternoon, and Conjoined Meeting of the M. I.

Passed the Mexican customhouse the next morning in a pouring rain which continued the whole day and following night; the first rain in that region, I am told, for nearly two years.Arrived at Diaz, Saturday, OctNov. 5 about 6 P.

The next day, Sunday, Sunday school, Public meetings in the afternoon and evening, filled out my program for the day, which was followed on Monday by attending the Academy fore= and afternoon.

 Provo. May 27thPresident Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In conformity with the arranged program for the fifthCouncil of which notice had been given to the respective StakePresidents and Principals, I arrived at Logan, Tuesday, April 19;and accordinally received and hospitably entertained byProf. J. H. Paul, Principal of the B.Y. College. Wednesday,April was spent exclusively in attending the classes exercises at theB.Y. College. It is with much satisfaction that I can report thefine condition of this College in regard to intellectual pro-gress as well as to spiritual standing and general disciplinealthough it must be stated that it has been somewhathard at first for Prof. Paul to partake of the spirit of oureducational system; in as much as ^during^ the first few monthsof his labors at the College his usefulness was greatly im-paired by his vigorous participation in the struggles ofthe political drama and his theological instructions beingfixed too much upon the [illegible] philosphies of the age,both of which mistakes Bro. Paul is mainly striving toovercome. It is to be regretted that by the time this efficientteacher, promising^es^ to become such a valuable co-laborerof ours, willing will leave the educational profession and 
 all the branches ofThis grade, including Kindergartenwork, having[ rensined ]her Normal training and been practical teacher for yearsin Holland:  I addressed the students of the College inthe morning of Thursday, April 27; and left for Franklin,Idaho, in the afternoon.  A meeting of the Seminary Boardwas held at the Tithing office at 4 P.M., and the sameinstructions were discussed and unanimnously adoptedthat had been given at all the Boardmeetings during theprevious Circuits.  I regretted exceedingly that the Seminaryhad closed, and the Principal, Bro. Thomas A. Condie, had leftfor his home in Morgan City, taking all the records with himin order to straighten them up before June 30.  Bro. Condiehas written to me once, promising to have them returned [par-]ly made out before June 30.  I have also instructed Bro. JosephG. Nelson, Principal of the Oneida Stake Academy, at Pres-ton, to examine those Records after their arrival, and reportto me their condition.  It appears from the statements by mem-bers of the Board that Bro. Condie has not given entire satis-faction, having been any deficient in discipline.  This SeminaryBoard deserves much credit for their energy in providinga handsome building tolerable well furnished, andthey are determined to keep in the lead in educationalmatters at Franklin, although there is a chance now inIdaho to get reliable trustees and teachers for thedistrictschools. 
 by Bro. Robert H. Smith, until the arrival of Bro.John H. Mills, the present Principal, recommen-ded by me for that position by a request of Bp.Johnson, to send someone that could speak Spanish and understand Music. Bro. Mills has proved a saviour to the school. The Academy is crowded, he is assisted by two lady teachers, oneof whom is his wife. The latter has to teach the Primary Dept. in her own home as yet, as the additions to the building had not been quite completed. Too much cannot be said of the devotion of Bp. Johnson, his counselors, and of the people generally, in making their school a success. The tuition is free to all the children of schoolage. They people assess themselves for the maintenance of the school and the completion of their conjoined school-and meeting home.The affairs of the Academy were conducted thus far by a Board of Trustees, previous to the organization of a Central Board of Educa-tion under the direction of Apostle Teasdale.Tuesday, Nov. 8, we started for Juarez, arriving at Dublan, about noon the following day. Here we visited the school kept by Bro. Anson Call, who followed us up to Juarez for the purpose of making himself familiar with 
 trade his fine talents to law and politics in which pursuitshe expects to find more adequate renumeration.  The College is sustaining a serious loss by the resignation of Bro. Kerr,who has accepted a call as Profesor of Mathematics at theUniversity of Utah, his place is to be filled by Bro. Gowansfrom the B.Y. Academy of Provo.  Prof. Paul is ably sustainedby his Faculty, among whom Bros. Todd and Apperly de-serve especial montion as the chief standard bearers of thespirit of the Latterday Work in the College. A very pleasingfeature of the B.Y. College is the Preparatory Dept. in chargeof Sister Hoving, an experienced Lady and Primary Teacher,and fervant Latterday Saint.  Like many other youngtalented, but ambitious teachers, Prof. Paul was inclinedto build up higher classes for scientific and literarypursuits to the neglect of the foundamental branchesof education. The objection to such a course does not liemerely in the fact that only comparatively for are preparedto take such courses and the expenses of maintening themwould amount in some instances from $150 to $200for each student per annum, but that such studiesrequire the most eficient teachers of the Faculty, whohave to donate their whole time to the instruction ofperhaps 10 to 19 students in all, while their labors aretaken away from about 200 who are just as muchentitled to the benefits of their instructions. In follow-ing up this original inclinations, Prof. Paul intendedyou to dismiss Mrs. Hoving with her whole departmentof from 60 to 75 children in order to make room for 
 Provo, March 29th [189]2President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In conformity with the program for my fourth circuit, sub-mitted to Bro. G. Reynolds, on March 18th, I started for Ogden the same day and met with the Board of Education of WeberStake at 5 P.M;. ^On the following day, I^ visited the Sunday school of the Second Ward,addressed the public meeting in the afternoon, and the meetingof the Fifth Ward in the evening, on all of which occasionsthe proper training of the youth and the principles ofour educational system furnished me the texts. Monday,March 21, attended the Academy the whole day, met againwith the Stake Board after close of school, and ^by request^ gave a lec-ture to the Seventies in the evening. It is gratifying to reportthat the members of the Weber Stake Board of Educationare all active workers in the cause, and under their ju-dicious management that Academy is forging its wayto the frontrank among our educational institutions. Imade them acquainted with the requirements which,according to the General Circular No. 8, soon to be pub-lished, would constitute a real Academy in our Church-School Organization. They are determined to obtain teach-ers of the required qualifications and grades for next 
 2.Oneida Stake Academy.Having arrived at Preston in the morning of Thursday, April 27.I had the privilege of attending all the exercises of the Stake Academyduring the day.  As the Principal, Bro. Jos. G. Nelson had beenengaged a greater portion of the academic year with princconcerns in order to establish himself permanently at Preston,an Assistant Principal in the person of Bro. David Hansonhas been engaged, assisted by Sister Mete Nelson and Neils [E li]Benson, all of whom were found doing faithful and efficientwork.  The records were in excellent order.  Although many ofthe students have to come daily to school large distances,some of them from 5-6 miles in various kinds of consequen-ces, and even the nearest of them have to walk about ahalf a mile through sleet, snow, and wind in wintertimesthe attendance roll shows a degree of functuality andregularity surpassed only in a few of our churchschoolsThe Academy building is nearing its completion, but the classwork has got to be caried on in the basement.  I haveto offer some severe criticism on the unnecessary ex-penditure for ornamental architcture in that buildingand the Board has accepted my suggestions of turningthe two entirely superfluans side entrances into windows 
 our educational aims and purposes. Arriving at Juarez. Wednesday, Nov. 9, about 5 P.M. we were kindly visited by Apostle Teasdale, but have to go at once to the Academy where all the students had been waiting for our arrival to have the privilege of shaking hands with us. There were 67 of them, with Bro. Dennis Harris, as Principal, and two lady-teachers as Assistants. That evening we addressed by appointment a conjoined meeting of the M. I. A. the house being crowded to overflowing. The next day I spent in the school. Bro. Harris has conducted this schoolat his own risk for several years most successfully and desires to have his school fall into line with the wholeChurchschool Organization. Pres. Teasdale organized a Central Board of Organization for the Mexican Mission, and also authorized  Local Boards of Education to be organized for the Academy at Diaz, and the Seminary at Dublan, the first two Boards have sent in their application for recog-nition already, and Dublan will soon follow.There was another crowded meeting at Juarez, that Wednesday^Thursday^ evening, and the following day, Thursday ^Friday^ morning, we started on our return trip to 
 more academic classes composed of 3 or 4 students each.In my representation of the case to the College Board of Trustees,Prof. Paul was told that the Trustees would find the roomsfor Sister Hoving and her pupils, as ^for as^ many as she could get.As Prof. Paul has practically demonstrated his earnest desire tofall into line with our educational system we fast so he can,It would be unfair to criticise too closely the deficiencies inthe Records to be kept in every one of our churchschools ac-cording to Gen. Circ. No. 7, page 17, the more so as his pre-decessor, Prof. Tanner has not left them in as complete acondition as they should be. I have Bro. Paul's promiseto have them in order by most academic years.  Thursday,April 20, I met with the Trustees of the College, to which meeting by was attended by my, request by President Orson Smithand his counsellors. The organization of a Stake Boardof Education was discussed and effected. The interview wasone exceedingly pleasant one and will probably be practive-tive of much good in the educational interest of thatStake. I had the pleasure of adressing that same evening perounded meeting of studented and patrons of the B.Y. Collegein the aims and spirit of our educational system.By special invitation of Apostle Moses Thatcher I par- 
 year. The Faculty consists of the Principal, three male,and two lady-teachers. Neither of the two ladies, however,had undertaken thus far to qualify herself for the spe-cial instructions enjoined to be given in our churchSchools by lady-teachers, according to Gen. Circ. No. 7, page 18. The Board promised me that this featureshould find ample recognition with the begin-ning of next academic year. This Academy has hadabout 200 students registered during this year, but owingto the late opening will have been in session only 27weeks iat the end of this academic year. The newAcademy-building, although not yet quite finished, iswell of arranged for educational purposes, reflectingmuch credit upon the energy and good judgementof the Board. The Principal and Teachers areearnest workers, and are anxious to fully qualifyfor their work according to instructions in Gen. Circ.No. 7, pages 5-12.Box Elder Stake Academy.According to appointment, I arrived at Brigham City,Tuesday, March 22nd, at 1.30 P.M. and met withPresident R. Clawson, and another member of theBoard, and the Principal, there being no Quorumpresent. The Stake Academy had closed for theyear at the end of the third term, as it was sta-ted to me by President Clawson, on account of toosmall attendance. I called the attention of the bretherento the instructions given on the subject in Gen. Circ. No. 7, 
 them not only saving several hundred hollars of expen-diture, but also obtaining greater comfort to teachers andstudents.  The great hall will be a magnifcent and receptionhall, but as educational auditorium.  There was a Boardmeeting in the afternoon with full attendance, and themembers felt unanimiuously to carry out the instructiongiven in behalf of the General Board.  The Faculty meetingwas also attended by Pres. Parkinson.  The Principalship ofthis Academy is [illegible ] of particular [illegible ]just now, in as much as Bis. G.

To my surprise Iwas in formed that the school had discontinued and the new Seminary building being rent to theDistrict School Trustees. I wrote an explanatory letterto President Parkinson in regard to the mode ofprocedure in such cases and obtained the promiseof proper observance of our regulations for the future.Oneida Stake Academy.After having participated in the meetings of the OneidaStake Conference at Franklin during Sunday and Monday, April 23 & 24, where opportunities two had beengiven me to urge upon the people the necessity oftrue education, I left in company with Pres. JosephF. Smith and Apostles Lyman and Thatcher forPreston Monday afternoon, where a large meeting washeld in the basementrooms of the yet our [illegible]Academy building. The meeting was crowded to overflowing and addressed by Pres. J. F. Smith, ApostleThatcher and Lyman, and myself. The Stake Academyhad just closed its session, the previous Friday. 
 St. Joseph Stake.I left Deming the same evening for Borine Station at the Southern Pacific Ry, arriving there near midnight and took the stage for Thatcher the next morning, arriving there about 4 P.M. and was very hospitably received by Pres. Christopher Layton. That day, Friday, attended the Academy fore= and afternoon. The Principal, Bro.Geo. Cluff, is assisted by Mrs. Birdno, his sister. There is some splendid work done by those two in that Academy, although is not very largely attended just now, having recieved quite a backset during the recent politicalcampaigne, the Principal having been away on an sta-tioneering tour through Arizona for four weeks. Bro.Cluff is earnestly endeavoring to fill up his scatteredranks. In a Boardmeeting held on Saturday, manyresolutions for the successful carrying on of theAcademy and of the Religion classes were adoptiveand Pres. Layton manifested a deep interest in the matter. A meeting of the conjoined M. I. A.and Sunday School Officers concluded Saturday'sproceedings. The following Sunday was spentat Pima filling three appointments as usual. 
 pages 4-5, that such a step should not be taken withoutconsulting the General Superintendent, who is held res-ponsible to the General Board for his permission.In this connection I feel it my duty to report, thatmany of our Stake and Local Boards seem to be tooin different as yet to the instructions given by the GeneralBoard from time to time, and I should suggest, thatrepeated carelessness of this kind should not be leftunnoticed in any appropriation for such a schoolthe following year, or some other impressive remin-der be adopted, in order to emphasize in such cases,the injunctions of the General Board. This complaintrefers also to the Church School Papers, published byorder of the General Board. Bro. A. Vance, the Principalof the Box Elder S.

The next morning at 3 o'clock I leftby Oregan Short Line Ry. for [Minnidoke], where I was takenby Bro. Prim to Albion, Cassin Co. to hold a meeting there inthe evening in the Wardmeetinghouse.  Pres. Haight havingjoined me at Albion, we left for Oakley in the morning ofTuesday, May 2nd, where I had also to address a publicmeeting in the evening.Cassin Stake AcademyWednesday, May 3rd, was devoted to visiting the Stake Academyin the forenoon.  The Principal, Bro. A. F. O. Nielson, is a young manof much promise, and has done very faithful labors for threeyears in that Academy. He will take charge the coming schoolyear of the Tooele Stake Academy at Grantsville.  The StakeSuperintendent of Education of Idaho, has procured forBro. Nielson, although entirely unsolicited, a [Lifedipls]of the First Grade, to teach in any educational institutionin the Stake of Idaho, "in appreciation of his ability andefficient labors as an educator."  On this account I amsomewhat arry that Bro. Nielsonleaves that state, as hisremaining there would have given considerable prestige

Hoskins, with whom Iattended the following day a meeting of the Stake Boardof Malad and in the evening a public meeting Samaria in the educational interest. The former Sem-inary at Samaria has been discontinued for the presentacademic year and its Principal, joined the StakeAcademy at Malad as Assistant Teacher, by mutual

Anson Call as Principal. The latter will also apply for a License under the usual registrations, as also Bro. Harris, his Assistants, and the lady-teachersat Diaz. We arrived at Diaz, Saturday, Nov. 12, about 3 P. M. just in time to attend the meeting of the Primary.There was also a very crowded meeting of the M.I.A.in the evening. The following Sunday, was occupied with attending the usual three meetings, at which the Saints fully endorsed the appointment of a Local Board for the Academy, and of Bp.W. D. Johnson of Superintendent of the ReligionClasses throughout the Mexican Mission.A meeting of the Local Board was held bet-ween the afternoon and evening meetings.Monday, Nov. 14, we started on our return-trip to Deming where we arrived Wednesday, Nov. 16, about 2 P. M. My most cordial thanks are due to Apostle Teasdale, Bp. Johnson and the Saints throughout the Mexican Mission,for the great hospitality shown me; and for the deep interest they have manifested in our edu-cational movement. 
 ton with the early train for the purpose of visiting theDavis Stake Academy. I found Bro. Woodbury, thePrincipal, and Miss Woodruff, his Assistant, con-ducting an Intermediate and a Preparatory Depart-ment, comprising 38 students in all, a remnantof about 85, attend that attended during the winter.There is good work done by these two teachers, althoughBro. Woodbury, according to his own statement, islacking as yet somewhat in discipline. I havegiven him some pointers which, in connectionwith the instructions he will get in the comingNormal Summer School, may in able himin future to overcome this deficiency. My comingnot having been previously known, was not at-tended by any Boardmeeting, but a public meetingin the evening, enabled me to address a large au-dience on the subject of our Church Schools andReligion-Classes.Morgan Stake Academy.Tuesday, March 24th, found out at Morgan City, whereI spent the evening in conversation with Bro. Geo. JRamsey, the Principal of the Stake Academy, in orderto get posted in regard to the educational conditionof that Stake. The attendance at the school has sunkdown from 45 to 11, and the Principal reports thatthe apathy among the people and of some of the

 agreement between the Stake and the Local Board Tuesday,April the 26th, spent the whole day in attending the musical atthe Stake Academy, conducted by the Principal alone. Hisschool having diminished very much to a great extent,The Assistant Teacher has taken to his farming and sayinghis last term, leading the Principal alone to conduct allthe class of the 3 4 & 5 Readergrades. Bro. Geo Cole is afaithful worker and is improving professionally ina very satisfactory manner. This school is on a solidfoundation. The Board contemplates to enlarge theaccommendations for the school by proposing aportion of their yet unfinished tabernacle next sum-mer. These improvements can be made at a cour-parstively small expence.  There is yet a very largeamount of local jealousy between Portage and Ma-lad as to the permanent location of the Stake Acad-amy, which is greatly to the disadvantage of theinstututions.  The sooner the General Board wouldgive instructions to have this question definitelysettled the better it would be for the educationalinterest of that Stake. Public meetings at Malad andPortage in the evenings of the Wednesday ^Tuesday^ and ThursdayApril 26 & 28, h in the interest of our churchschoolmovement, have not been, I trust, without somebeneficial results.Cassia Stake Academy.Arriving at Oakley, via Collinston, Pocatello, and Minersvillein the afternoon of Saturday, April 30, where Pres. extendedto me the hospitalities of his home during the time of 
 Maricopa Stake.Monday, Nov. 21, I started for Maricopa, via BowieStation and the Southern Pacific, arriving at Tempe,Wednesday, Nov. 24, where I was received by Pres. Chs. I.Robson, who took me to Mesa City. There was ameeting appointed the same morning, which waslargly attended by the Saints and many outsiders.Thanksgiving Day brought on two more mee-tings, and the following Friday was spent inthe new Academy. Bro. Robert H. Smith, for-merly of Diaz, is the Principal.  Although Bro.Smith was not familiar with our system, andI had some apprehension before meeting him,I must confess that he has surpassed by far myexpectations, both spiritually and intellectually.I had to give him some pointers for his guidancein future, of course, but he is doing good workand carries a good influence with him.He is very humble, teachable, and devoted tohis work. Saturday was a meeting of the StakeBoard. The three meetings on Sunday kept ongrowing in attendance, that I was told that inthe evening meeting there had been as large acongregation outside on the sidewalk and atthe windows as there was inside. The Saints here aswell as in the Mexican Mission and in Uintah seemto be spiritually hungry. 
 leading men is very discouraging, although I found duringmy visit that all are speaking in the highest terms ofthe labors of Bro. Ramsey. Bro. Ramsey is assisted part-ly by one of his lady-students as a tutor, and his ownclasswork, general management and influence is to becommented very highly. At the Board meeting in theafternoon ^of Friday, March 25,^ the general indifference of the people wasmade conspicuous by the report of the Treasurer, thateven leading men were owing yet their tuition for the1. 2. 3. & 4th year. I suggested to the Board the proprietyof carrying on that part of their Academy work uponstrict business principles in future, and that the Treasurerin his Annual Financial Statement to the GeneralBoard on July 15% should not only state the amountof unpaid tuition but also the number of parties among ^from^whom that indebtedness was due, for it might perhapsoccur to the General Board to ask for the names.That shot will sound secure the payment of the greater portionof the amount, as some leading men ^I dared say^ would sooner paytwice the amount then have their names broughtbefore the General Board, in such a way. As it is verydoubtful if the Stake Board will secure the Courthouse at

The great Fastmeeting the next day was spent with the rest of the Saints in a four hours' meeting under the in-fluence of the Spirit of God in a very marked degree, when Ialso found time to perform the duties of my mission.A very pleasant meeting of the Stake Board was held inthe afternoon and evening, after which an adjournmentwas taken to attend a public meeting especially arranged forme. The subject of Religion-Classes formed the chief topicof my remarks. Monday, May 2nd was spent in the Academy.Here the Principal Bro. A. F. O. Nielson conducted the PrimaryDept. inclusive of III & IV Readers alone; the larger students,constituting the Intermediate Grade, having had to quitfor the 11 term on account of farm work. Outside ofthe B. Y. Academy and the B. Y. College I have seen nowhere among our churchschools such splendid primarywork as there is being done by Bro. Nielson. Althoughthe new Academy building is not quite finished, it issufficiently so that both stories can be used by the Ac-ademy to advantage. That small Stake, thinly popu-lated, composed mostly of non settlers struggling withthe arid soil for a living, calls forth my admirationfor their faith and united energy to make their Academy

I arrived at Oakland, Thursday, NovDec. 1st, at 10 P. M. being cordially received by Bro. John L. Dalton, at 16th Str. Station. The next day was spent in visiting Saints in Oakland and San Francisco, and taking a drive to the Cliffhouse in -the midst of a trenching rain. Saturday more visits and some writing. Sunday two meetings to smallcongregations with some strangers. Bro. Dalton is much handicapped in his movements to hunt upsome old members of the church in Las Angeles,Sacramento, and other places for want of funds.I started for home, Monday, Decr. 5, and arrivedTuesday night.Summary.During this circuit I attended 7 Boardmeetings, 29Public Meetings, visited 8 churchschools, and organized several educational Boards, being about from Oct. 17 to Dec. 6, being 50 days in all.With kind regards,Karl G.

 Morgan City for their Academy, ^next acad. year^, it is a matter of veryserious concern what to do in case of such a dis-appointment, the more so, as Bro. Ramsey wouldbe willing to make his stay permanent one,if the people should desire it so. Otherwise, Bro.Ramsey would be a valuable acquisition to anyoneof our churchschools.Summit Stake Academy.Having been previously informed by Pres. W. W. Cluff,that the Summit Stake Academy had closed at theend of the third term with a "handsome attendanceand a very creditable examination", I know that Ishould not have the privilege of visiting the school,but hoped to meet with the Board and withthe Principal, and then got some idea of thecondition of affairs and of the work done. Onmy arrival at Coalville, Saturday, March 26, at 6 P.M.I found that the Principal, Bro. Geo. Middleton, hadleft for his home in the South, and that therecould be no Boardmeeting on account of theabsence of most of the members. Bro. Middletonis going to withdraw from the educational fieldas he wants to go east in the fall to study Medicine.I am sorry for this unceremonious way of quittinga labor which that young man has performedto the benefit of his pupils and much credit to himself.

He desires to pur-sue his studies for qualifying himself in highergrades I shall be crowded for Principals next year, asseveral others have given notice to quit for the samereason, and the sufficient supply of qualifiedpersons for such positions becomes excedinglydoubtful.Bannock Stake Academy.Tuesday, May 3rd found me again on the road in orderto reach Rexburg via Minedoka, Pocatello, and MarketLake, arriving at my destination Wednesday afternoon,May 4th. President Ricks having met me at Market Lake,and made me comfortable at his house at Rexburg.Thursday, May 5th I spent in visiting the Stake Academy, con-ducted by Bro. Chas N.

Watkins has infused new life into the educa-tional affairs, and so ably assisted by Sister BarnesThe great drawback for the further development ofthis Stake Academy is the schedule refusal of all the Wards of at the southside of the river to supportthe Academy in any way either by sending studentsor with means. This feeling extends to the public meetingand to Quarterly Conferences. When holding meetingsby appointment at Lewisville and Eagle Rock, which

 President W. W. Cluff posted me, however, as far as possiblewit in regard to the condition of the school, laid before meall the Records of the Academy, to be kept accordingto Gen. Circ. No. 7, page 17, all of which I found ingood order, and stated to me the difficulties withwhich their Academy had to wrestle from the beginning,having had to change its locality four times alreadysince its organization. There is, however, a prospectof securing either one of two fine houses, well suitedfor schoolpurposes at comparatively low figures, ifthey could hope for some assistance in that direction.As in all the other Stakes visited during this fourthcircuit, the Religion-classes in Summit Stake havebeen sadly neglected in some Wards, in consequence ofwhich I arranged with Pres.

By special invitationof Pres. Paxman I had the privilege of attending andaddressing the beautiful Prayercircle, at Nephi, onSunday morning, followed by a visit to the Sunday school

Cluff strongly protested against my star-ting to Heber City, via Park the next morning, de-claring that the heavy storms then raging in themountains could not be endured by me inthe situation I was in, and so I had to cancelmy appointment for Wasatch Stake Academy,telephoning to Pres.

 places at the southside of the river, I took occasionto talk privately with the respective Bishops on the subject,and was surprised at the intensity of the feeling existing inthat portion of the Stake. The Bishops declare that it is theunanamimous feeling of the Saints on the south side of theriver, that they are suffering for want of spiritual nourish-ment on account of the geographical location of theirsection of the Stake, and that there be no hope for them untilthey get organized into a Stake for themselves. Althoughthis feature does not belong to my department for discusion,I have to refer to it as it greatly impedes the progress ofthe educational work.  The predecesosr of Bro. Watkinshaving not been very exact in keeping the records re-quired in our schools, Bro. Watkins has great difficultyin straightening up his books, but hopes to have themall in order before opening of the next schoolseason.[7;] The reason of above alluded to a quorum of the Stake Boardcould not be obtained and some informal conversation bet-ween the five members present and myself have in the edu-cational interest had to take its place. Several meetingswith the teachers during Friday and Saturday resultedin arriving at a mutual understanding in regard to

 This is by far the best organized and conducted Sundayschoolwhich it has been my privilege ever to visit. At the mee-ting of all the Instructors after the close of the school,I explained, by request of Pres. Paxman, the harmony ofaim and methods existing between ^the^ SundayschoolWork and the Religion Class Movement, on thebasis of the Circularletter on the subject, dated Sept. 12.A discourse in the afternoon meeting, and a lectureto the conjoined M.

Call,and his assistant, Miss Mattie Nelson, have assumedall the financial responsibilities of the school, exceptthe fuel, and have met also in this regard withunforeseen success.  The Academy is paying itsway very satisfactorily, the attendance being largeand constantly increasing.  In the Primary Depart-ment, comprising pupils from the First to theFourth Grade, inclusive, all seats were taken. ThisAcademy is rapidly passing to the front among ourchurchschools, and the prospect  is, that the StakeBoard will be under the neccessity of enlargingthe premises, with the disappearance of thefinancial stringency just now prevailing everywhere.

The Seminary here has been in chargeof Bro. Martin Winters and his sister Mary, both ofwhom are faithful young people, but notyet beinggraduates, their efficiancy is rather limited in some respects. It was the best, however, that could bedone under the circumstances.  They had to runthe Seminary of their now financial risk, but filledthe house with about 75 pupils this winter.

 At the meeting of the Stake Board after schoolhours, theestablishment of Religion-Classes on the basis of the Cir-cularletter, was decided upon, and Bro. J. D.

The Recordbook of this StakeBoard of Education shows are very punctual attendanceof all the members, regular meetings, and comprehensionof the importance of their mission.

 Provo, October 5, [189]3President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In consequence of the great diversity in the nomenclatureof Grades, Departments, and Classes, in many of our church-schools, a great confusion in this respect had arisen, ma-king an estimate of their comparative standing andlabors on my part and a subsequent correct reportto the General Board almost impossible. To obviate thisdifficulty for the future, Church School Papers, No. 20, Juv.Instr. April 15, last, recommended this subject with severalothers to the consideration of all churchschool teachers, pre-paratory to discussion at our Annual Convention.The Annual Convention met at the Brigham YoungAcademy, Provo, August 14, at 11 A.M. The proceedingsof that Convention are reported in the Church School Papers,No. 23, Juv. Instr. Sept. 1st. After much discussion of theabove stated point, it was decided to refer it to the Boardof Examiners for the formulation of a mode of nomen-clature, to be complied with by all our churchschools,as soon that mode of nomenclature should haveobtained the sanction of the General Board ofEducation.

Being exceedingly sensitive himself it is strange howhe can be so inconsiderate sometimes with the feelings ofothers. Saturday, May 14th, a meeting of the Stake Board washeld at which the numbers manifested unanimously thedetermination to develop the interests of the Academy andReligion-Classes throughout the Stake.

This subject I have followedup on many other occasions since then.  Passing throughParowan the following day, I arrived at Cedarin the evening, attended Sunday School in themorning of the Sunday, afternoon and eveningmee-tings.  The necessity of a Normaltraining for SundaySchool workers was very apparent in Cedar City.An extenuating circumstances in regard to the back-ward condition of their Sunday schools is the pe-culiar occupation of the majority of the people inthat region of country viz: The dairy business is ta-king young and old during a great portion ofthe year into the mountains, thus braking upday-, church-, and Sundayschools; the youngpeople returning late in the fall educationallydemoralised, and requiring much time to getthem back again into the spirit for studying any-thing.The Parowan Stake Academyat Cedar City, is conducted by Bro.

Tuesday, May 17, I left for Randolph, where I arrived in the evening, and followedan appointment made for me that same evening toaddress the people in behalf ofThe Rich County Academy.This institution in reality working but a Seminary, and was per-mitted by the General Board with the consent of the BearLake Stake Board to assume the title of "Rich CountyAcademy in view of its isolated geographical position,similar to that at Elba, Cassia Stake, where now an Academy or churchschools building is in progress oferection. The Randolph Churchschool has thus farbeen permitted to occupy the upperom of the Court-house, but doubts are entertained by the LocalBoard in regard to the occupancy the coming school-year, which makes the erection of are own school-building a necessity sooner or later.  Bro. Olaf Larsen,the Principal informed me that the school had closedthe previous Friday, and that he himself desired toresign. Wednesday a Boardmeeting was held in theafternoon at Woodruff, at which all the membersindicated their appreciation of Bro. Larsen's labors with 
 records and the spiritual, intellectual, and dis-ciplinary condition.  The Board hopes, that Bro. Warnermay make his permanent home in Cedar.  The atten-dance in the Intermediate Department was quite lowas yet but a large increase was expected at the begin-ning of the next term. Pres. U. T.

 Provo City, March 7th [189]3President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Herewith I submit respectfully the report of my labors in theSecond Circuit, the program of which had been previously ap-proved of by you.The Brigham Young Academy, Provo.After having officially notified the Board of Trustees of this institutionof my intended visit to the Academy, I spent two days, Jan. 10 & 11,in attending the various exercises of the institution, and met withthe Faculty at the regular meeting, Wednesday, Jan. 11, at 7 P.M.This Academy surpasses all other churchschools not only in thenumber of its students (over 900 registered up to date) and ofits regular teachers (23), but also in the complexity of its organiza-tion and in the amount of labor performed there, in consequenceof all of which the influence of that Academy is recognizedthroughout all the Stakes of Zion. Besides the regular de-partments graded according to Gen. Circ. No. 7, pp. 19 to 21, thereare following special organizations: 1. A Kindergarten Classwith about 30 little ones under 6 years of age, with a Normaltraining Class for young ladies to prepare themselves for thatparticular feature of education. 2. A polytechnic Classfor training in practical workmanship. There are over 40 
 schoolhours, as the children are then too tired to take much interest, and especially many boys have to gohome to do chores; neither could all the good be ac-complished on Saturdays for the same reasons as re-gards to the boys and many of the larger girls. Itwas therefore, decided to apply to the School Trustee sto close the district schools one hour at least sooner one day or two in the afternoon, for the purpose ofletting our children have the privilege of going totheir Religion-Classes.  This plan has met withmuch favor everywhere, that it has been adopted thusfar since, in St. George, Parowan, Beaver, Sevier, andSanpete Stakes. The Stake Academy at St. George hashad to suspend operation for this academic year,and Bro. Nephi Savage, the former Principal, has ad-opted a position as teacher in the Districtschools, buthas been appointed as Stake Superintendent of Religion-Classes. The same evening I filled an appointmentin a meeting at Santa Clara. Saturday, Nov. 4, ad-dressed a conjoined meeting of the M. I. Association ofSt. George, visited the next morning the Sundayschools,and addressed the meeting of the Sunday Schools. 
 students waiting to take part, as only about a dozen only areat work just now, on account of lack of facilities. 3. A classfor military and physical drill, constituting a completemilitary organization, fully uniformed and furnished fromCamp Douglas with a complete stand of arms. 4.a class in Physical Culture for young ladies with Normaltraining in that branch of study. 5. A cClasses in Ladies'Work, Plain Sewing, Fancy, and in all other branchesin tht line, fully graded. 6. A class in the Fine Arts,with Painting and Modeling. 7. A Music Department,consisting of three grades in Instrumental Music,and in a "Choral Society" for Vocal Music. 8. TheCommercial College, with three teachers, just over 50students. 9.The Normal Department with a fouryears' course, counting nearly 250 Normal students.10. The M. I. Association Normal Course. 11. TheSunday School Teachers' Normal Course. In the faceof the immense amount of work which this Insti-tution is performing for the benefit of the youthof Zion, it is greatly to be lamented that the Boardof Trustees of the Brigham Young Academy findsitself drifting irresistibly towards financial break-ers, that threaten a catastrophe too serious in its resultsas that such a possibility could be contempleted withequanimity by any lover of our Youth. 
 at noon; and a public meeting in the Tabernaclein the afternoon, after which we took our de-parture from St. George, having been appointedfor on evening meeting at Washington. That mee-ting there was crowded, and Karl Gottfried Maeser|I noticed with muchsatisfaction the presence and close attention of theyounger portion of that community. Monday, Nov. 6addressed a large meeting in the evening at Toquer-ville. As there are several young people from thisand other places in St. George Stake attending theNormal Course for Sunday School, and M. I. Asso-ciation Work at the Brigham Young Academy, at Provo, a vast improvement in these institutionsthroughout the Stake is looked forward to afterthe return of these Normals. I am sorry to statehowever, that one of them, Bro. Jedediah Larsonof St. George, died at Provo last week, of pneumonia.Tuesday, Nov. 7, we arrived in the afternoon atKannarah, and I addressed as per appointmenta large meeting there in the evening.  It wouldbe ridiculous, if it were not too sad, to notice therestraint ^under^ which the young men felt themselvesobliged to ^be^ in that place, to behave themselves atleast sufficiently during the meeting, in order notto become absolutely offensive.  "You see, Bro. [Maeser],"so said the Bishop to me, "Stockraising is [capacitated to]never to be seen in decent society." 
 Upon the representation of the undersigned, the StakePresidency of Utah Stake with the consent of the High Coun-sil have organized and appointed a "Stake Board of Educa-tion", to whom henceforth the "Board of Trustees of the B.Y.A."will be held accountable.  This new Board sustained the ac-tionof the last Stake Conference, to suspend for the pres-ent academic year the operation of the "Religion Classes" inthis Stake, in order to give the Sunday School NormalClasa a fair share to demonstrate its thoroughgoing influencefor good.  By appointment of Pres. Smoot I filled an appoint-ment in connection with Bp. Booth at Springville, whilethe Principal and teachers of the Academy filled similarappointments in the other Wards of this Stake, in orderto educate the people ^up^ to an appreciation of our educationalaims.Sanpete StakeIn compliance with appointments made for me by Pres.Canute Petersen for the time I had placed myself at hisdisposal, I started for Mt. Pleasant, Tuesday, January 17 to address a public meeting in the educational interest thatsame evening, and to visit the Seminary the next day, andmet with the Local Board.  Bro. Geo. Christensen, the 
 Wednesday, Nov. 8, we returned to Parowan, where the sameevening a meeting of the Seminary Board was held, at whichthe devotion of the members under the wise leadershipof Bp. Charles Adams, manifested itself very markedly.The Seminary had opened five weeks before under thePrincipalship of Bro. Frank Cutler, who has accepted theposition under the conditions of the usual pro rataplan, and has gained already within that short timethe confidence of the community and of his pupils,so that the attendance at his Seminary is daily increas-ing.  His records are in first class order, and his plans,programs, methods, and general progress of his workvery satisfactory, so that he expects to have an assistantbefore long.  His Sstudents comprise the 6, 7, & 8th grades.Much credit is due to the Seminary Board for fittingup and furnishing the Seminaryrooms in such ahandsome and suitable manner.  A reception to addressme by the Authorities and People of Parowan in theevening, I completed only in my capacity as a representativeof the General Board of Education in whose names I thankedand congratulated them for their appreciation of the aimsof that honorable body, and expressing the hope, that 
 Principal, is one of the ^our^ most conscientious and efficientIntermediate teachers, and as such I recommend him tothe consideration of the General Board. This Seminaryis held in one of the former Ward School Houses, but con-tains only one room, in consequences the students arevery much crowded, and soon the engagement of anAssistant Teacher, although much needed, becomesinexpedient. The wise and energetic course of Bp. Lund,the chairman of the Local Board, has made therevival of this Seminary a possibility.  It is questionable,however, if the Seminary will be able to run the  full 40 weeks this year; but the Local Boardare determined to make all possible efforts for afull academic year the next time. They could havenearly 200 students willing to attend, if they could ac-commodate them.Sanpete Stake Academy, Ephraim.

Andrew C. Nelson, Principal, andMiss Flora Bean, Assistant. This Seminary occupies its ownbuilding, tolerably commodious as far the Intermediate Dept.is concerned, but the Preparatory Dept. is located upstairs, withan outside entrance and a drafty, riggety, and inconvenientstaircase leading up to it, forcing teachers and students togo to and fro in all kinds of weather, besides losing agreat deal of time, while with a little change in thearchitecture and comparatively small expense, allthese evils could be obviated. The Principal is doing afine work. I had designed him for the Principalshipof the Stake Academy, at Ephraim, which should havebeen his proper place, but he concluded to remain atManti in response to the solicitations and promises

Holstein Warnera Graduate of the Brigham Young Academy, andhis assistant Miss Sarah Ann Higbee, volunteer teachers onthe pro rata plan.  I am happy to report the Academyin excellent condition both in regard to the required 
 of the Local Board. It appears, however, that this Boardis not able to meet the just expectations, financially, ofBro. Nelson, who therefore, in justice to his increasingfamily, will have to seek for a better position thenext schoolyear. As his case is not the only one amongour churchschool teachers, but the number of similarcases is bound to increase with every year, thus placingus in the deplorable condition to give young teachersan opportunity to obtain practical experience inour churchschools for a few years, or as long as theyare willing or able to look upon their engagement asa mission, but then have to go into the District SchoolService for better pay, and we start again with freshbeginners, supplying the District Schools with efficientteachers, and keeping in the rear with inexperiencedfaces. I again recommend this matter to the earnestconsideration of the General Board.Saturday, January 21, I returned to Ephraim, in order toattend a meeting of the Stake Board of Education, at10 A.M; a meeting of the Religion Class Instructors ofthe Stake, at 2 P.M; and a meeting of the Church-school Teachers Convention of the Stake, at 7 P.M.It gives me great pleasure to report that meeting of theReligion Class instructors, the only one which I have 
 records and the spiritual, intellectual, and dis-ciplinary condition. The Board hopes that Bro. Warnermay make his permanent home in Cedar.

As Sanpete Stakeof Zion has taken the lead in this great movement and ismaintaining its prestige in this respect as well as inthe number of its churchschools, I cannot speak in toowarm terms of the influence for good observable amongthe young people of that Stake. The Normal Class in theStake Academy is attended by about a dozen students, whoare recognized at the Church Normal Training School, atProvo, as "Junior Normals" as "Normals of the First Year."
