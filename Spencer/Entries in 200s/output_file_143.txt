If they should feel sour toward me for not sending them a more scientific teacher, they must blame themselves for not being more explicit in the beginnng, as I could have told them then, that I had none to send.  Bro. Axel Nielson, assistant teacher, of Bro. Spori Principal of Bannack Stake Academy, at Rexburg, writes that they have had a very encouraging opening with fine prospects before them.  I also received a communication from Bro. Berthelsen, La Jara, Colorado, desiring information in regard to a building for a churchschool, which I have answered as well as I knew how at the 15th inst  Bro. Jos. G. Nelson, of Coalville, reports the inau- guraton of the Summit Stake Academy, and speaks in glowing terms of the energy and foresight of the Authori- ties of that Stake in providing for the new Academy.  Thus I have endeavored to lay before you a short summary report of our Academies, as for as 
 continued  one of our Past graduates, to take temporary charge of the B. Y. S. Academy at Paris, with a letter of explanation. I suppose that there were no students in that part of country yet ready for higher academic studies, but that they needed it a solid fundamental [instruc]- tion previous to next school year's work. when I should find a Professor for them, as it was done in Salt Lake and Logan. They seem to have, however, higher views up there already, and Bro. Taylor was not accepted for not teaching the higher mathe- matics. Bro. Tayler has accepted, therefore, the districtschool at Montpelier for this winter.  I have written the Bretheren at Pan- guitch, as directed, that Bro. A. R. [Cutler], 
 continued  I have been able to gather information.  The idea that more Academies might be attempted to be started this winter, worries me, as I should have no more teachers for them.  The Preparatory Schools in Salt Lake, I spoke of above, do not trouble me so much, for, if they ever be organized, I think I can find teachers for that kind of work.  I am troubled in my mind abut this lengthy communication to you, especially in these days of tribulation, when all hell seems to have her forces out to attack the Cause of God, but I hope, that after the perusal of the letter, you will find  few moments time, to dictate a few instructions to me, in  side of which I may go ahead in the great work of education of the youth of Zion.

The reports from the St. George Academy are very cheering, and will come before you as soon I shall be instructed by you to officially communicate with all the Principals in order to get some reports from them.  My son Reinhard, Principal of Beaver Academy, is very much discouraged there, but I have labored with him that he should not send in his resignation, until he had asked your advice in the matter.  Bp. Archie Mc Kinnon, of Randolph,

I have submitted to him a number of points, about which he should give me information, that we could advise him intelligently.

Dear Brother,  Your favor of the 24th ult., enclosing letter from Brother Udall in regard a Stake Academy building was duly re - ceived, and enclosed please find a suggestive rough sketch, as I have been able to adjust the required items in my mind.  A Lectureroom for Stake Conference pur- poses, to hold about 500 people, and premises for an Academy are so widely different in their nature of operation, that I could find no other plan suitable, but by separating them into a lower and upper story. The classrooms below have been designed on the prin- ciple of 16 sq ft. to the pupil, which allows sufficient room for aisles, recitation place before blackboard and teacher's desk.  I have located no windows, leaving that to the building committee to determine, in regard to their number, size, and form, all of which  depend upon their taste and extent of means. Any good mechanic can construct the building or its [general] plan after these rough Specifications.  Please to parden me for not answering any sooner,

 Provo City, August 7th 89  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  The Brigham Young Academy commenced its  fourteenth academic year last Monday morning with  over 100 students, which number is still increasing, and  by the indications we expect one of the largest atten- dances this Academy has ever seen. There are now al- ready 45 Normals enrolled, of whom 10 come under  the Church appropriation thus far. The names of  those selected on the strength of promises given dur- ing last academic year, are as follows: Charles Dorius, of Ephraim; Wm. Winters of ; John Johnson, of  ;  Geo. Shelley of Lehi; Alex- ander Nielson, of Provo; John H. Wootton, of American  Fork; Alice Findley, of Panacca, Nev.; Mary L. Hansen,  of Parowan; Amelia Fillerup, of Lake Shore; Annie  E. Carlsen, of   . There have been, however, so many Normals last year, who have paid their  tuition all along in the hope to come under the  appropriation, that I am in great embarrassment  in regard to some of them. Several have been

But a  few remain concerning whom I do not know  what to do. I have either to send them home again,  or pay their tuition myself. They are deserving, and  have had partly a promise to the effect, if there  should be a chance; their names are: Alice  Reynolds, of Salt Lake City; Annie Brown, of  Pleasant Grove; Wallace Billings, of Manti; and  George Middleton, of Ashley's Fork; and Jos.  Dunyon, of Draper. I lay the case of these five  last named students before you in the hope of  getting some instructions in regard to the course,  I shall take concerning them. The last two ^but one^ have  been practical teachers already. Our Normal  Department once enjoyed an additional appro- priation for ten students from the Utah County  Court, which for fear of "Liberal" opposition  had to be withdrawn, and we have kept up 
 Provo City, August 24, [18]89  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  It is with great diffidence that I yeild to the necessity of submitting to ^you^ enclosed correspondence.  But as Bro. Crosby has written to you also about the difficulty, enclosing my letter to the P. S. Board per A. N. Cutler. I see no other way be- sides finishing the controversy.  Permit me to call your attention to the passage in my summary report to you, of July 17, where on page 6, I refer to the Panguitch Stake Academy.  As my letter concerning the matter has been forwarded to you by Bro. Crosby, a comparison bet- ween my report to you and that letter will show the correctness of my statement.  My enclosed letter to Bro. Crosby of today, will furnish the last argument in the case, and I shall abide by your decision.  If you shall direct not otherwise, please let Bro.  Geo. Reynolds send my letter to Bro. Crosby.  With kind regards  Your brother in the Gospel  Karl G. Maeser  Please return Bro. Crosby's letter to him.

The reorganization of the de- partment also now, in order to meet the require- ments of our advanced grade in the Churchschool- service; and the special course for lady teachers, all of which arrangements the Junior Normals classes in the other Academies are not yet prepared  to comply with, necessitate extra pecuniary efforts,  that it will be impossible for this Academy alone  to make! I once before proposed to the General  Board the establishment of a Primary Drill  Department for our Normals, composed of about  24 to 30 children from Chartclass up to 11 Reader- grade, free of charge, to be conducted on the alterna- ting plan by Normalstudents entirely under the su- pervision of the Normal Professor. The children to  be supplied under certain conditions by the four  Bishops of Provo. This plan was not endorsed  by the General Board just then, but I shall keep my faith that it will yet be carried out 
 Provo City, August 26   89  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  Again I am under the necessity of submitting an enclosed letter to you for the purpose of getting instructions in regard to further proceedings in the matter. As the letter explains itself I need not refer to the special points there in myself.  Bro. Harnes of Kaysville, chairman of the local Board there, wrote me about two weeks ago, that Bro. Jedediah Taylor, whom I had recommended to them as their Princi- pal for this Seminary, had not sufficiently impressed them at his visit at Kaysville, and theyproposed, there- fore, to engage him only temporarily for one term.  This proposition Bro. Taylor refused to accept, and I wrote them that I had no teacher for them under such a con- dition as t would be extremely unfair to any teacher to be set adrift under some pretext, after all schools were supplied, and he stood a poor chance to get a position. Another thing it would be, if there were just complaints which should prove by investigation to be well grounded. They have reconsidered their original proposition,

I have opened correspondence with the leading  Publishing Houses of the United States in regard to  their educational works, especially Kindergarten- work, Normal Training, Courses in Ladies' Work,  Drawing, and Music, in order to recommend to our  teachers the best that can be found for their private  studies, or professional use. Upon your advice and  instructions on any or all of these stated points will  depend my course to a great extent in this Normal  Department. Knowing your great sense for justice  and equality for all, and at the same time the fin- ancial difficulties surrounding you, I do not  make these statements for the purpose of obtaining  more means, but to get your direction in regard to  the best course for me to pursue in the matter.

Taylor to call me the Stake President, Chairman of the Stake Board, and Principal of the Stake Academy at his earliest con- venience, and work in harmony with their instruc- tions. A course for which a promise mostly  complete is set by the 18. Ward L.D.S. Seminary and the L.D.S. College at Salt Lake City.  I am ready to visit Farmington and Kays- ville at any time you shall appoint.  As I have an appointment for Mt. Pleasant, Friday, Aug. 30, to meet with the people in their in- terest of their Seminary, I should be thankful for any instructions you should desire to give me for the occasion.  Please let Bro.

 Provo City, Febr. 15.  [18]90  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother, In compliance with your instructions I started for Price Station at D.g RG. Rg, Saturday, Febr. 8, at 1 P.M. having tele- graphed my arrival to Bro. L. M. Olsen, at that place. Arri- ving at Price at 5 P.M. was kindly recieved by Bro. Olsen and hospitably entertained by him until Sunday morn- ing. Starting for Huntington at 5 A.M. arriving at the place at 9 A.M. met President Larsen of Emery Stake at the residence of Bro. Howard, his second counsellor, and President of the Stake Board of Education. One hour's conversation before the morning meeting convinced me of the existence of a strong party feeling about the location of the Academy. Huntington or Castle Dale were the [watchwerds], and each party endeavored of its influence are in their favor Stating, however, to these bretheren your instructions, that neither yourself nor the General Board desired to influence them either way, leaving the settlement of their question entirely to the Saints of Emery Stake, I had no authority whatever to take sides.  When I found that Presidency of the Stake was divided, the Stake Board in its majority lean- ing one way, the High Council in its majority leaning 
 nan 
 continued  the other, and that even some bitter feeling was exis- ting, finding expression of in various insinuations and recriminations, which it would have been extremely unwise to permit to break out in open Conference. I proposed to President Larsen, to postpone the official discussion of the subject until after the afternoon mee- ting, when he might call a special meeting for that purpose, composed of the Stake Presidency, High Coun- cil, Stake Board, and the whole Bishopric of the Stake, all the members of these various bodies being repor- ted present. I expected under God's blessing to have oppor- tunity to engender a spirit of unanimity on this sub- ject among the Saints before that Council should meet. The meeting was crowded both in the fore- and in the afternoon, the bretheren making the most of me both times as far as physical effort in talking was con- cerned. The subject of the welfare of the rising genera- tion and our educational system forming the chief- topic of all the discourses by the speakers. The Council was as stated above, and by request of Pres. Larsen I laid ^before the bretheren^ the principles according to which this whole deliberation should be conducted. To the great 
 continued  honor of the bretheren it must be said, that each side was represented sincerely, honestly, and in spirit wil- ling to abide by the decision of the whole Council. Once only a voice called for explanations of the cause of all the bad feeling in the past, that was frowned down, however, by the almost unanimous sentiment of the meeting. After Pres. Larsen had several times called for more expression of views on the subject, none re- sponding, "[ipoustive]" was called, and the vote taken. Pres. Larsen never committing himself for either side during all the proceedings. Votes stood: Huntington 10, Castle Dale 29. One of the bretheren from Huntington moved to have this vote made unanimous, which was carried. Seldom has it been my happy lot in my ministry to witness such a brotherly feeling as there was mannifested in that Council-Meeting, and I blessed the brotheren in the name of the Lord, tel- ling them, that I should have done the same of the vote had gone the other way, recognizing that the Spirit of God had guided them in their deliberations. The meetings on Monday more equally crowded and blessed with a spirit of anonimity and rejoicing 
 continued  The Conference sustained the decision of the Coun- cil to have the Academy located at Castle Dale. Only five brothern from Huntington voting against it. With  the exception of the rather ominous beginning of my mission on Sunday morning before meeting time, this has been one of the happiest educational visit  I have made. The Stake Board of Education met  at noon on Monday, accepted Bro. Alexander Jameson as Principal, voted him a salary of $60 per month, and concluded to run the Academy for two terms to the end of the schoolyear. I had intended to go over to Castle Dale with the brothern and start the Academy, but very stormy weather having set in during the day, the bretheren thought it better for me to return with Bro. Olsen to Price at once, as it would not be safe to risk a return to Price, 22 miles on terrible road, in stormy weath- er this time of year. Arrived at Price at 9 P.M. and returned to Provo Tuesday morning.  With kind regards Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser 
 Provo city, Febr. 22nd, [18]90  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  The copy of the letter of Bro. Attewall Wootton, Pres. of the Wasatch Stake Board of Education, to President  A. Hatch, is before me and has been purused with  great care. As I cannot speak by personal knowledge of the case, but have before me only Principal Enoch Jorgensen's letter and two printed extracts from the "Wasatch Wave," which do not coincide entirely with  Bro. Wootton's report to Pres. Hatch, it reduces itself  in my mind to a question of veracity between the  statements in my possesion and the proceedings of  investigation before the Wasatch S.B.E. As the case has been reported, however, to the General Board by me, I have  nothing to remark anymore in regard to the merits of  the case. There is a statement, though, in Bro. Wootton's letter to which I must take exception. He criticises  Bro. Jorgensen's action in reporting ^to me^ the disgraceful conduct of a member of the Stake Board, by which  the efforts of the Stake Academy in reforming the general spirit of the youth in that neighborhood  were paralyzed to some extent Bro. Wootton con 
 continued  tents that the case should never have gone outside  of the Stake. Not mentioning the circumstance that the  offence had been known to every member of that Board for some time without anything being done about it until the General Board demanded an investigation, it was clearly that Principal's duty to ask my advice  in the matter, what position he should take in the  premises. I did advise Bro. Jorgensen in my answer in following words: "I fully realize, dear Brother, the  difficulties of your position in that peculiar Stake of  Zion, in fact, I was aware of it before you went there, and, as you know, for this reason the Lord directed me to  select you for that position. I have carefully read the two  clippings from the " Wasatch Wave" and your own com- mends upon them. It is a serious matter for a member  of a Board of Education to disgrace himself in the manner  in which Geo. Cluff has done it, and I shall report  the circumstance at the meeting of the General Board  next Friday, Febr. 7 for instructions." There were some  general instructions in my letter to Bro. Jorgensen,  which, however, had no direct bearing upon the case,  besides being available in their applications to any 
 Provo City,  September 26. 89.  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In compliance with your instructions of Sept 7th recieved per telegram, I made appointments for my visits at Far- mington and Kaysville for Sept 11 & 12 respectively. Having a few hours to spare on Tuesday, Sept. 10, between my calls at your office, I spent them visiting the 18 Ward L.D.S. Seminary, Horace Cummings, Principal, Mrs. Hardy & Miss Snow, Assistants.  I found the three classrooms, thus far occupied well filled with pu- pils, and the recitations in running order.  I found, however, the Daily Pogramms not yet in a settled and well defined order, nor was there a Plan for the various classes made out.  The discipline in Bro. Cum- mings' department did not seem to be as yet firm- ly established, while the recitations of the two lady- teachers deserve much commendation in this respect. I have called Bro. Cummings' attention to these points and have received the assurance that I shall find these draw backs over come at my next  visit.  The recitations themselves, how ever, reflect much credit upon those three teachers.  The pupil 
 continued  emergency. I am decidedly of the opinion that Bro. Jos- gensen has simply acted in the line of his well defined duty, as much as it was mine to report the case to the General Board. I should very much desire, that Bro. Wootto should be instructed to that effect, as this case estab- lishes a precedent for similar ones in the future. If the President of that Stake Board and the other members are of the opinion that the Principal of the Academy has overstepped his lines, the position of Bro. Jorgensen becomes to that extent more difficut, than it is already.  With kind regards Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser 
 went through this exercies with spirit attention, and lively interest, showing such progress the short time taken into consideration.  My next visit will be one whole day, when I shall be able to form a more correct estimate of the spiritual and intellectual standing of the insti- tution.  Wednesday, Sept. 11 I arrived at Farmington in time for the opening of the morning exercises at the Davis Stake Academy, Bro. Joshua Greenwood, Principal, James Steed, & Mr. Welling, Assistant. The students were divided into three departments, located one in the main- hall of the Meetinghouse and the other two in Council- [shop] [wherf] and vestry.  Considering the somewhat inconvenient arrangement of the passages and studies, and the entire unappropriateness of the locality for schoolpurposes, the order, quickness, and discipline maintained by the students did not only reflect very creditabilty upon the Principal and Teachers, but [madd purified] as much at home with them as if that school had been in operation for years in our churchschool system.  I attended every recitation in the fore-and afternoon, alternating between them as circumstances suggested, and cannot 
 too much in praise of the labors of these teachers and their Principal. In the afternoon a young Bro. Willer from Farmington made his appearance, in the Academy, and took charge of classes in Gen. History, Algebra, and Physiology in a manner that astonished me, and I recommend that young man to your attention, for there is a rising young teacher in him. I have advised Bro. Greenwood to have Bro. Miller apply for a license as teacher in the Churchschool- service. The Students of that Academy, are full of enthusiasem for their studies, and go any length for their Principal, as do the Authorities and People of Farmington. President Smith, his counselors, and several mem- bers of the Stake Board of Education met with me also in consultation about the educational affairs of the Stake especially in regard to the Kaysville embroglio. It was arranged that the Stake Presidency and myself should meet on day ^Thursday^ Sept. 12 at 5 P.M. with the Local Board of the Kaysville Seminary and try to come to an understanding. The new Academy building at Farmington re- flects much credit when the good judgement

Sanpete & Sevier Stakes.  Leaving Provo for Mt. Pleasant, via Nephi and Moroni, I arrived at Mt. Pleasant Wednesday, March 12, at 5 P.M  Mt. [Plea]sant Seminary.  March 13. Bro. Geo. Christensen, Principal, and Mrs. Clementine  Erickson, Assistant & Lady-teacher. The Seminary occupies the upper story of the Coop-Store, two rooms, commodious, well lighted and ventilated, nicely furnished, separate entrances to each room, aby the liberality of Bro. Madsen, owner of the building, under very resonable conditions in regard to rent for premises and use of furniture. There can be over 200 student accommodated. 100 stu dents have been in [atten]dance during the two terms the  Seminary has been in existance thus far; they were classified in a IV and V Reader grade; forming, how- ever, for a start, only one department, called Preparatory. The members of the Local Board have taken a very active part in the development of their Seminary, realizing the necessity for their utmost efforts in counteracting the influence of the Presbyterian Academy at Mt. Pleasant. Bro. Christensen, the Principal, is one of our most prom- ising Churchschool-teachers, combining his labors in the Seminary with his appointments in the Sunday- 
 and [energy] of the Authorities and People of that Stake. After schoolhouse at [Farm] City, some members of the Stake Board, and School [illegible ] students said myself meet in the upper room of the Academy.  Prin- cipal and Teachers made their reports and I had to answer several points of inquiry about manag- ment and organization where I especially accen- tuated the duties of the Lady teacher to regard to her particular mission in our churchschools.  Counsellor Hays took me the same [pruening] in his buggy to Kaysville in answer to a special invitation from that Local Board to attend a Soiree in the Seminary building gotten up for the purpose of raising some more means for school furniture and utensils. At the visit and at Pres. John R. Barnes we were joined by Presidents Smith and Call of Davis Stake. The new Seminary-building is finished and reflects much credit upon the enterprise of the people of Kaysville and the management of Bro. Barnes, as Chairman of the Board.  It was arranged, that all discussion of the misunderstanding between the stake Authorities and the Kaysville Board 
 school and in the Mutual Improvement Association. The influence of that young man among the young people at Mt. Pleasant is very remarkable. Mrs. Erickson, as lady- teacher, seconds the labors of the Principa[l] [in] her manage- ment of the lady-students. The classwork done under my observation during the day showed a satisfactory efficiency considering the short time the Seminary has been in existence. A Boardmeeting and a lecture on our Churchschool system in the meetinghouse at night on our Churchschool System, concluded the proceedings of the day. The following day, Friday, March 14, was Public Examination at the Seminary. Class exercises, Resitations, Vocal Music, and Presentations of tokens of respect to the Teachers from the Students, Speeches by Members of the Board, Patrons of the Institution, exhib- ition of Ladies Work, Specimens of Drawing and of Penmanship, were features of the occasion, that marked the opening of a new era of education in  Mt. Pleasant. The mission I gave ^offered^ to the young people in the name of President Woodruff, to set henceforth a good example in all things before their companions was respect accepted by them enthusicastically.  Saturday, March 15. brought me to Ephraim, where I spent the day in getting posted about the affairs of the Stake Academy in conversations with President Peterson and Principal Greenwood.  Sanpete Stake Academy.  The Academy occupies as yet a building not very well adapted for schoolpurposes. The [lower room houses] 
 should be postpound until the councilormeeting on the following day, in consequence of which arrangment we spent a very enjoyable at that inceedingly will coudor- ted entertainment. The size of the Kaysville Seminary- building is the same as that of Farmington Academy- building with the difference that Farmington is now building the right wing from the main entrance, while Kaysville has built the left wing. The finishing in- side is tasteful and subsationtial and will be similar in both also. As the Kaysvile Seminary was not ready for opening until September 16, I had the time on Thursday, Sept. 7 at my disposel until 5 P.M.  Th. which I thought I could occupy to greater ed- vantage by opening a few hours at the Weber Stake Academy at Ogden, and took therefore, the morning train for that city. Bro. L. F. Moench, Principal and Oscar Vance, Assistant, with usual Volunteer [Insuibels] as Tutors, were found busily at work. The attendence is about 90, for an Academic and In terms [with] and [^I^] [Preparator] Dept. with some academic [word smudged] this added. Bro. Moench explained to me he [income] as the comparitively small attendance 
 150 students, is divided into two apartments by a stage- curtain and is tolerably well furnished. The Board owns a building which has been occupied thus far by the districtschools, but will be taken [po]ssession of by the Academy in the fall, with prospects of gre some improvements to insure greater convenience and facilitates to teachers and students. A lecture by my- self to the Polysophical Society concluded the day. Sunday, March 106 gave me the opportunity of witnessing the finest work in the organization of a Sunday school Theological Class that it ever has been my privilege to become acquainted with. The credit for which is accorded by the brethren to the untiring efforts of Bro. Alma Greenwood, that class seems to have collec- ted all the young people of Ephraim, of more mature aged filling the large hall to overflowing; they being attracted and held there from Sunday to Sunday by the spirited manner with which the exercises are conducted. An address the afternoon meeting in the Tabernacle, and a lecture in the evening at the same place concluded my share of that day's work. Monday, March 167, found me spending the whole day in witnessing the exercises at the Academy, conducted by Principal Greenwood, and his Assistant and Lady- teacher, Miss Carrie Henry. The students are divided into a Preparatory and an Intermediate Department, with several students taking advanced studies preparatory to a Normal Course. All the classes re- cited very creditably, and the spirit and discipline, 
 is in the first place the "Freeschool system, recently inaugure- ted in Ogden, to content against, them the indifference of a great many leading citizens from among our people, the many other [schoolships]. Seeing that Bros. Moench and Vance were actually doing good work, and that the blame could scarcely be with them, I called on, Apostle F. D. Richards for advice in the matter.  Although Bro. Richards was seriously indispossed, he entered at once with deep earnest into the subject, and it was thought best to lay this matter before you, if you would not instruct me, perhaps to confer with Pres. Shurtliff: for the purpose meeting with that Stake Board and the Faculty, and devise some plan by which the in- terest of the people of Weber Stake could be aroused in the educational movement of the Church for the welfare of their own sons and daughters asking instructions you should feel to give me in this re- gard shall be carried out to the best of my abil- ity.

I outlined to the Brothern the mode of proceedure which the General Board under your direction has adopted and while has been my course throughout, [gallos-] trating it from instances occurring in our Church school- Organization, unphasising the fact that the order of the Priesthood and the Spirit of the Church was the keynote of all our operation. Saying that the best thing in the world can be spoiled by the wrong way of doing it. I showed the Brothern of Kaysville where in they had missed it, especially in not counselling with 
 establish a Seminary.  Salina  Prest. Seegmiller and myself spent an evening at that place and addressed the people in the evening on educational topics. Although one of my most trustworthy Normal Graduates has been laboring here for two years as a teacher in the district-school, having been recommended by me for that position, by special request of the Stake Author- ities, it seems that the contrary influences of that place are too much for all our efforts. Bro Hayes, the teacher, reported to me, that it has been impossible for him to keep the Mutual Improvement Association alive, and he is going away now altogether discouraged in regard to the outlook. That place seems to be a "Forlorn Hope," and ought to be held at any price.  Richfield.  Arrived at Richfield, Friday, March 21, and had to address the by special invitation, the County Teachers Association immediately after my arrival, and spent the rest of the day in conversation with Bro. Jos. J. Anderson about Academy-affairs.  Saturday, March 21. Went with Pres. Seegmiller and others to Monroe to fill an appointment for the evening. The Stake Authorities and Board of Education deem it advisable to have a churchschool in this place, although the [mans] 
 their Stake President, ever acting upon any advice of his in their educational movement. In honor to the brethern of Kaysville it must be said, that one after another acknowledges his ^and their^ mistakes declaring, if they had under- stood this matter as they did now, this ill feeling and misunderstanding would never have arisen. Only one member seemed to remain unreconciled and said so. President Smith addressed the meeting with great form, logic, and feeling, promising to get at the root of all these hankerings by communening with the High Council of the Stake. There certainly was mani- sested in the beginning of the remarks of all the Kaysville Brotheren a sentiment of accusations a- gainst the Stake Presidency, which I endeavored to  show them, was the very cause of taking them off the track. The meeting adjourned with the best of feeling, apparently, between all parties, and the difficulties amicably settled, pending some points to be adjusted here after at the High Counsil.  By special appointment I addressed at 8 P.M. a large audience of young people in the interest of edu- cation in the Kaysville Meeting house 
 home, the only available place for that purpose, is ill adapted, being too high in the ceiling, making a large echo and being too cold in winter, therefore.  Elsinore.  Sunday, March 24, addressed a meeting of the Saints at 10 A.M. By special solicitation of the  Ward Authorities I permitted Bro. John Johnson, one of this year's Normal Graduates, and a Church- Normal at that, to teach their district-school the coming school year. Elsinore being his home they intend starting a churchschool sooner or later, when Bro. Johnson is expected to take charge of it.  Richfield.  Addressed this public meeting in the afternoon and lectured in the evening.  Tuesday, March 25. Spent the whole day during schoolhours at the Academy, conducted by Bro. Jos. J. Anderson, Principal, Mrs. Merinda Halliday, Lady-Teacher, and a Miss Alice Hoyt, Assistant, besides two Normal-students conducting single classes each. The Academy occupies the old meetinghouse, with four classrooms, and a Principal's office, and enjoys all the convenien- ces possible under the circumstances. The or- ganization of the school, the classwork, spirit, and discipline of the school characterize Bro. Anderson as a teacher of much ability, and as being ably supported by his Assistants 
 There are other points to be submitted to you, which have come up during my correspondence with various Churchschools as their respective Boards. As I however have troubled you already with our 8 pages, I shall postpone further statements, un- til more fitting opportunities, when the labors preparators to Conform us, will have been re- moved from your mind.  Praying that Israel's God may be constantly with you and reveal unto you His Holy will concerning the welfare of His people  I remain  Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser 
 Somehow, however, Bro. Anderson has labored under the disadvantage of suceeding Bro. Isaac  Hayes, who had possessed the hearts of the Au- thorities, the pupils, and the people at large, to an unusual degree. He being different from his predecessor, and yet being measured by according to the latter's standard, my difference was charged against him, and some influential men having secretly made up their mind before hand, in spite of my protestation, to have Bro. Hayes back anyway, no matter who succeeded him all this combined to operate against Bro. Anderson, obstacles which his own disposition was not cal- culated to remove either. Hence a very un- pleasant scene, entirely undecerved and un- called for at on the at the Boardmeeting in the afternoon took place, in consequence of which Bro. Anderson's labors as Principal of the Sevier S.A. will cease at th[e] [c]lose of the term, and I have prom- ised to sustain Bro. Hayes as his successor, if the Board can make satisfactory arrangements with him. In company with Pres. Seegmiller drove over to Glenwood and addressed a meeting there in the evening.  Tuesday, March 26, started for Gunnison, via Redmond, and gave the people by special re- quest a lecture in the evening, returning to Provo, via Juab, the next day Wednesday March 27 
 Beaver, Parowan, St. George, Kanab, & Panguitch Stakes.  Wednesday, April 16 Left Provo for Beaver via Milford and arrived at Beaver the following day at 3 P.M. meeting that evening with the Prin- cipal R. Maeser, and his Assistant Daniel Book in consultation about the Academy-affairs.  Friday MarchApril 18. Spent the day in witnessing the exer- cises in the Academy, conducted entirely by Bro. Book, assisted by a Normal-student in repetition-work the classes comprised only children of the Primary Grade this last term, the higher grade having been discontinued at the close of the previous term on account of too small attendance. The Prin- cipal exercising only a general supervision over the Academy during the first and fourth term, and being actively engaged only in class work during the second and third terms. This arrange- ment is decided unsatisfactory on general principles, but must be tolerated temperarily in consideration of the surrounding circum- stances. Bro. Book was recommended by me to that Stake Board for the purpose of preparing himself for the successership as Principal, my son Reinhard desiring to resign. It is generally to the advantage of any school, if sudden change in the Principalship can be calcu- lated for such [a great change]. Bro. Book went to [Bro. Reinhard] [4 illegible words] 
 Provo City, October 7, [189]0.  President Wilford Woodruff Chairman General Board of Education.  Dear Brother, In conformity with your instructions and those of the General Board as published in the Deseret News and date of June 11, exam- inations of Church school teachers were held at Gunnison, Cedar, Logan, Salt Lake, and Provo at the specified times. Records of pro- ceedings have been carefully kept and are respectfully submitted in accompanying book. Results thus far obtained show, that 15 Candidates have passed ^for^ the Primary Grade, 47 for the  Intermediate Grade, and 3 as Specialists in Music.  The Board of Examiners had held several consultations pre- vious to the appointed times for examinations, to decide upon the propositions and the general mode procedure, minutes of  which deliberations have also been recorded in the book before you.  Owing to the serious illness of Bro. Talmage, Bro. Benjamin Cluff jr. recently returned from Michigan University, acted, accord- ing to your instructions, as Assistant Examiner, taking spea- cial charge of the examination-exercises at Salt lake City, while Bro. Tanner conducted those at Logan, and I those at Gunnison, Cedar, and Provo, although attending also 
 to study hard outside of schoolhours, preparatory to his expected responsibilities. But although he has done most excellent work in the lower grade, his advancement in his studies is not yet marked enough to notify me in recommending him to the Principalship for next year, and the time of probation must be extended. The Board have sent me a petition to nominate him as Prin- cipal, he being quite popular, but mere popu- larity and efficient primary work are not the only essential qualifications of a Principal. The Beaver Stake Board of Education have in cor- porated, bought a lot in town, have the foundation laid for an Academy-building, and hope to have it ready for occupancy in the fall. The plan is good. Two story-building; seatingroom for 250  students. I suggest that all Boards of Education in the Church deposit there copy of their plans with^send^ specifications with the Secretary of the General Board.  Parawan.  Saturday, April 19. Left for Parawan, arriving there at 4 P.M. Bro. Morgan Richards entertaining me hospitably during my stay.  Sunday, April 20. Addressed Sunday school in the morning, public meeting in the afternoon, and gave an educational address in the evening.  Monday, April 231. The Bretheren at Parowan requested me last year to supply them again 
 with a districtschool teacher, as I have done for a number of years in the past. In sending them a Bro. Jensen one of last year's Graduates I hoped to have prepared the way for the establishment of a churchschool, which was our mutual aim. Although Bro. Jensen has given entire satisfaction, the people looked longingly back to Bro. Oscar  Vance, their former teacher, until now laboring as teacher in the Weber S. Academy at Ogden, and Bro. Jensen himself, being a married man, desires to be nearer Sanpete, the home of his relatives. Bro. Jensen goes, but Bro. Vance does not come back as he intends to take a course of higher studies at the L.D.S. College. This arouses the breth- eren at Parowan to start at once a church school, for which I will have to find a Principal.  Cedar City  Tuesday, April 22 left for Cedar where I had to fill an appointment to address in the new beautiful Tabernacle the people in the evening.  Wednesday, April 23. spent the day during school hours the exercises at the Stake Academy, conduc- ted by the Principal Bro. Mayhew H. Dalley, Miss Sarah Higbee, Assistant and Lady-teacher, and Bro. Caslett as Music-teacher. There were a Prep- ratory and an Intermediate Department, with some advanced classes in academic studies. The grade of intelligence, discipline, organization, and spirit of [1 illegible word] at this Acade- 
 at Logan and Salt Lake part of the time.  This being the first experiment of the kind in our Church- school-Organization, a great many difficulties had to be over- come and much patience and persuasion to be brought into requisition in order to accomplish the object in view, namely to lay a sure foundation of efficiency in our Church- school-Service.  As the manuscript list of Percentages now before you shows several vacancies as yet it has been impossible for the Board of  Examiners to determine the Percentage of "General Efficiency." Several of the candidates were not able to attend the regular ex- aminations in consequence of which special examinations eith- er in writing or oral had to be held, involving a large am- ount of correspondence. The Board of Examiners asks here- by for instructions, whether the "General Efficiency" should be determined upon the Percentages obtained thus far, and or whether it should be left open until next year, until the Certificates be made out accordingly.  By As instructed, Bro. Benjamin Cluff jr. is now engaged to have his academic diploma as Bachelor of Mathematics and Didactics (BMD) corresponding to his diploma from the Michigan University as B.S. and will submit it to the President for signature in due time.  In addition to the items contained in my letters of July 24,  Sept. ^5 and^ and Sept. 250, ^all^both addressed to the Secretary Bro. Geo. Reynolds, I have to report following points of progress of our school-works:

 2. continue  In addition to the 37 church schools reported Sept. 20, there is another one to be placed on the list, namely a Church school at Fremont, Sevier Stake, Piute Co. in charge of Miss Arretta Young, concerning   the ^to be^ recognized grade of which school I respectfully ask your in- struction. I have visited the Church schools at Nephi, Provo, Huntington, Castle Dale, Cottonwood, 14 Ward, 18 Ward, and the L. D. S. College since the opening of the school season, met with the Seventies, Boards, and in several instances also with the people of the respective districts in public meetings. Several schools have started in August, some in September, some before Conference in October, and some intend star- ting Oct. 13 and 20. The establishment of special theological classes for children not attending church schools has been made  one of the subjects of my remarks to the people. A course of  instructions from the General Board is one of the essential requirements for this movement. In connection with  this I recommend also to the General Board the imme- diate consideration of the report of the Ladies  Committee. In consideration of the importance of vocal instructions in our church schools, I have requested that all Lady- Normals in our Normal classes should make that branch one of their specialties. 
 is becoming affected in many instances, and a much larger continuance of the school under such conditions would incur responsibilities upon some- one, that no body should dare to assume. The exercises conducted by Bro. Nephi Savage, as Prin- cipal, Bro. Frank Woodbury, Assistant, & Mrs. Ro- seinia Jarvis, Assistant, and by two Normal-stu- dents with single classes, were exceedingly creditable. But Mrs. Jarvis as Lady-teacher, has not worked up sufficient courage to commence a course of special instructions to the lady-students, a deficiency which I hope will be overcome in the future with the help of the general instruc- tions to be published by our General Ladies Committee, for the guidance of all our Lady Teachers throughout the Organization. From among the many interesting remarks made by the Members of the Board, Stake- and Temple- Authorities present at the occasion, I only state the one as characteristic of the spirit of the whole school, viz: "That it had not be found ne- cessary to establish any special domestic regula- tions for the students outside of school, as their conduct had been conceded by all to be so that they  enjoyed the fullest confidence of [Board since] [illegible] of it is the highest testimonial that can be given to any school in point of worship Saturday April 26, addressed by spirit I invite [illegible] & [illegible] school-teacher.

 Immediately after my visits to the church schools in the  North, it will become necessary to attend the church schools at St. Johns, Snowflake, and St Joseph, Arizona, that have never been visited, and are clamoring for a visit. The dis- tance I would entail ^cause^ expenses which I could not venture to in- cur without special instructions from the General Board.  The irregularity with which many of our church schools have  commenced this year s operations have in several instances proved disadvantageous to our interests, in as much as some very efficient teachers could not afford to wait until so late in the season before the schools to which I had assigned them would open, and I had to grant them the privilege of accepting positions in district schools. Some are asking now for teachers after all available talent has been disposed of.  Karl G. Maeser, Gen. Supt.  P. S. Some Principals complain that there are members of their respective Boards that have never taken an active part, never  attend Board meetings, nor care for the school, or patronize it in any way. They want to know what to do in such cases.  K. G. M.

Tuesday April 29. Pres. McArthur and myself forded the Rio Virgin at Grafton and went as far as Canaan Ranch, where I left Bro. McArthur and was met by Pres. Wooley of Kanab, going as far as Pipe Springs that day.  Wednesday, April 30, Arrived at Kanab at 2 P.M. Inspected with the members of the Stake Board the Academy grounds. The basement- walls were up ready for the joists, to commence the upper story. The partitions in the upper story are movable so that the three rooms can be thrown into one for public meetings in the capacity of Stake Conferences. The Board re- quests that Bro. Jedediah Wooley, at present teaching the district [school be] appointed a 
 explained to the bretheren the conditions under which this could be done. There is considerable discussion going on between Kanab and Order- ville about the location of the Stake Academy. I have advised the bretheren to await instructions from President Woodruff how to proceed in settling this question. Addressed a large meeting in the evening.  Thursday, AprilMay 30^1^ Attended Fast meeting and left in the afternoon for ^Orderville and^ Glendale, where I joined President Crosby of Panguitch, in connection with whom addressed a meeting in the evening. That small place has patronized the B. Y. Academy ex- tensively for many years, and some of our Church- school-Teachers call it their home ^Friday, May 2.  Held meeting in Orderville^  Saturday May 13. Left for Panguitch, but Bro. Crosby having taken ill on the road, stopped one night at a Ranch near Hillsdale, and arrived at  Panguitch  May 4.  Sunday morning at 11 o'clock. Visited Sunday school and addressed meeting in the afternoon. Board meeting in the evening. Several parties have offered to donate city lots for the lo- cation of the Stake Academy, the most suitable among them is situated south of the new Taber- nacle, just across the road. The President and Members of the Board are fully awake to the im- [portance] of church schools and are determin 
 part of the work is concerned.  Monday, May 5. Attended the exercises of the Academy, conducted entirely by the Principal, Bro. John Swenson, his Assistant and Lady-Teacher, miss Caroline  Fillerup having returned home at the close of the previous term, the attendance having fallen off. Bro. Swenson has made his mark among the young people at Panguitch. He has a herculean task before him, for the cowboy-element has thus far the controlling one in the neighborhood. Horseracing, gambling, footracing &c &c on the  Sunday &c are the characteristics of the young men there, and nowhere in all my travels among the people in Zion have I seen such a looseness in manners, even in public meeting, as it showed itself there, although I was told, the young boys had been uncommonly well behaved that day. But the President of the Stake and the Bretheren of the Board stand by Bro. Swenson, and quite a number of young men have already forsaken their evil ways. There were students of the Pre- paratory and Intermediate Departments, and some of the Primary Dep, mixed, and Bro. Swen- son has his hands full among his 60 pupils. He did splendid work though. Tuesday, May 6, left for Beaver, arrived at 6 P.M. Boardmeeting.  Wednesday May 7. Attended once more  the classes in the Academy conducted by Bro. B 
 who had straightened up all required Records in a very satisfactory manner. Addressed a large mee- ting in the evening.  Millard Stake.  Thursday, May 8, started for Kanosh, via Cove Creek and addressed an appointed meeting there, having been joined by Pres. Hinckley and some other bretheren. Friday, May 9. Went with Pres. Hinckley to Meadow and addressed a meeting there at 2. P.M. after which we started for Fillmore.  Fillmore.  Saturday. May 10. Met with the Principal, Bro. Josiah Hickman and Miss Lawish, his Assis- tant and Lady-Teacher. Found the records of the Academy in fine shape. The Academy occupies three classrooms and a Principal's office in the Courthouse. The premises are convenient, but not sufficient for the large attendance during the winter. It is said that within a  short time the "State House" will be sold at auction. If so that opportunity should not be suffered to pass by in securing it, and not let- ting it go into the hands of our enemies. There is, however, ^throughout the whole Stake^ a very pronounced feeling a- gainst the ^permanent^ location of the Stake Academy at Fillmore, they prefer Holden for that end. It will require the advices of President Wood- ruff to guide the people in the solution of the problem. A Boardmeeting was held in the evening  in which it appeared, that Primary Church 
 conds up to the III Readergrade, to be conducted by some lady-teachers were badly needed in the settlements, under supervision of the Stake Boards. Sunday, May 11. Attended and addressed Sun- day school in the forenoon and public meeting in the afternoon.  Monday, May 12. The exercises in the Academy were conducted with much credit by Bro. Hick- man, Mi and Miss Lawish. Bro. Rydalch, the other Assistant had left two weeks before at the close of the previous term. Students constituted a Preparatory and an Intermediate Department. There were also, however, a number of Junior Nor- mals writing in a class in Theory of Teaching very creditably. Bro. Hickman has trained quite a number of good districtschool-teachers in Millard County, and I bring herewith his Normal labors to the notice of the General  Board with recommendation of a suitable recognition.  Holden.  Tuesday, May 13. Left for Holden the same evening where I had to fill an appointment to address the people.  Tuesday, May 13. The leading bretheren of the place met me in the forenoon showing me all the advantages Holden had over Fillmore for the location of the Academy. Left in the afternoon for Scipio where I also addressed 
 a large meeting in the evening.  Wednesday, May 14. Returned to Provo via Juab.  Respectfully Karl G. Maeser Gen. Supdt 
 Constantinople, Sept 1st 1898.  President Wilford Woodruff and Counsellors, Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A.  Dear Brethern, When I last reported to you I was  at Sivas. I at once left for Zara to visit the Branch of our  church there. I found them very faithful and filled with the love  of the Gospel. They were, of course, very anxious to gather, and were  very happy in the thought that the Lord would soon open up de  liverence for them from bondage. They are not so hard up  for food as are the saints in Aintab, but they are more  in thraldom which makes life tiresome. The hope which the  Gospel gives is their life. Elder Nishan Sheriman presides. He is a faithul man & much beloved of the saints. He is also  respected of the outsiders & of the Government. The prospects there  are not flattering, a few are investigating. They were very fortu nate in not having to go through the massacre. The saints  fasted & prayed for seven days when they noticed prepa rations for slaughter & God heard their prayers & delivered the  town from destruction, for which they are very thankful.  They plad with me continually to ask the Brethern in Zion  not to forget them, that they might also be gathered to some place  where they could learn more of the ways of the Lord and  help to build up His Kingdom. A circumstance happened while at Zara which impressed me with a new idea about  traveling & preaching the Gospel in Turkey. I was for a little  while mistaken for an English Consul. From the whole af- 
 F. F. Hintze June 21 [18]98  Sivas, Asia Minor, June 21 [18]98  President Wilford Woodruff and Counsellors Salt Lake City, Utah,  Dear Brethern,  June the 19th Brother Nishan Sherinian and myself reached safely this city after a rather remarkable expeirience.  According to instructions from Apos- tle Lund I started north emediatly after his leaving Haifa for Zion.  At Beyrout I mailed him some information including a map of El gere, the villige for sale, all of which I learn by letter from him has safely reached him at Islington 42.  As he will present that part of our work I will not mention it here.  May 23rd We arrived at Allepo (Halep) And found President Maycock & Elder Larsen together with the saints well &  happy.  During the week we were envi- ted to a discussion with the Catholics 
 -fair I understood that if I were careful to notify my  Consul of my intended trip and obtained a Gen I'arme from the Government, that I could travel & stay at pleasure  without trouble. To prove this I determined on a trip to G r ne where I knew the Government did not want any foreigners  to go if they could help it. As soon as I arrived at Sivas  I turned my pass over to my consul Dr. Jewet who trea ted me with ^consideration^. He sent it by the Dragoman to the Government  who fix it O.K. and gave me a guide. I also asked him to  inform the Kaimakam at G r ne of my coming. When  I arrived at G r ne I had perfect liberty, was treated with re spect by the officials and met only the opposition which our  presence always produces with the Protestants. The experiment  was a success. It was said that several were ready to be  baptized but I did not so find it. There were good people and investigators, and probably those who would have been  baptized had not the Protestants raised such a storm. Brethern, the breaking loose from this world is hard every  where, but it is harder where no political rights are en joyed. neither have we had any formal acknowledgement  from the Government so that we could offer the needed  protection. I know we say have faith in the Lord, do right  and obey the gospel and let the consequences follow. But that  is hard for them to do ^who^ have, as a rule, but little moral force  of character. Much less than a century ago they were ignorant  priest-ridden Armenians. Now the Protestants have enlightened  them alittle. They are far from possessing that courage and  stability which our fathers have transmitted to us, and which  they possessed long before we heard the Gospel, Many are 
 in an anti chamber of the Chaldean Catholic church of Aleppo. We excepted the invitation. And for two evening we were discussing the question of athe Original Sin. Many were present and we hope much good was done, yet you know the Catholics atre, as a rule, not open to conviction. It was more remar^k^able because we were envited to a catholic Church. They suposed the victory easy, but found on the last end that the question envolved a great deal which they could not explain away. I was much troubled because I had to speak through an enterpretor.  On May 29th we had the pleasure to baptize 8 persons. Several were persons of good families.  June the first we arrived at Aintab & the following Sunday, fast day, we baptized 5 persons, One of whom is ^a^ man of some standing, his children ^are^ well educated. A- nother leading man is redy to be baptized.  The step is a great trial to them. Every effort is being made by the Protestants to hinder new members from joining. 
 honest and good, but thy need the same development  as we have to do as we do. They have not inherited the  experience, the self reliance nor the development of moral thought  & courage that we inherited from our parents, and which is in- creased & intensified in us by the knowledge of the gospel &  by the free institutions with which we are invironed.  At G r ne I met a Gentleman from Albistan about 75 miles south of there. He ^is^ what is called a Campbellite. He was  quite interested and told ^me^ of a little church in Albistan which  are seeking for truth. But his position was like the others. He  asked, are you recognized? I told him no. He urged recognition as did the others. The dominant churches over tax our people, They annoy them in numerous ways so that to step out  to begin anew takes courage. The Zara Aintab & Alepo branches  were organized before the lines were drawn so sharply. I therefore  earnestly plead with you, my Brethern, that you do all you can  for our Brothers and Sisters in GTurkey. In their present  condition they will need help continually, but if they can be  gathered out to one place they will evidently soon improve  as they are smart & apt to adopt new ideas & practices. That  you did not at once adopt our report and decide to buy the  Gire' property did not suprise me, indeed, had you done  so I should have been suprised. But it was all we could see in the short time we were investigating. We were looking more  for what we wanted, pr. instructions, than for what we could get. I am now looking for what we can get and where we can get  it. My observations will be reported promptly to you from time to time. And if we cannot now locate in the "Jackson County" of Pale- stine, I supose we can go to the "mountains" or some other 
 their houses are visited, All manner of vile stories are told. The families are shamed down ^& made fierce opposers to the men^ telling them that it would be better that they became Muhammedans or that they should commit some crime and be inprisoned than to join such an organization of out laws. They site with some force the fact that we are not rec- congnized by the Government of Turkey, while this is true it is certainly no crime; still it is being worked to a good advantage which you will see by the following account of our trip north. At Aintab our land- lord has been rather dilatony about fixing up outr room according to agreement & it bothers us some, but he will probably make it right on the last end. It is not so easy to accomplish just what you want here owing to the poor mail & transpor- tation service in this land.  Then maybe he also feels this as we are not recognized we are not very dangerous. Regcogniztion au- thority or a display of power is a great thing in this land of despotism. People are so cowed or bowed down that it is hard for a foreignor to understand. 
 place until we can, and there prepare the people to build up the Centre Stake in the Orient. We do not need to go  so far, All we need to do is to brave the danger of frontier  life as we did in Utah, and we can get plenty of Good land  & water almost for nothing. Syria is large, but Mesopotania  with its ancient water canal systems is empty & iddle. I am  told by those who know that there is not finer country in the  world, But ^it^ is well inland. Yet Uncle Sam backed by the Lord  is good enough for anybody. Since seeing what I have on this  trip my language is quite insufficient to express my gra  titude to God for America & her institutions, even aside  from what I know of the gospel. I shall, however, do nothing  except by your authority, but I have not lost hope in the  Ottoman Government giving us land on easy terms now that  we are not opposed by our own U.S. officials. They used to oppose  us now we have their assistance. I am told by Mr. Allaimby  U. S. Marshall to Turkey, that the Legation here 10 years ago went so far as to tell the Porte that we were not acknowledge as  a church at home and that they could not protect us. The Porte snubed them nicely by giving them to understand that we would  have the same recognition & protection as others. This was most  agreable news to me. The Marshall said it was on file at the  Legation & if I can secure a copy of it I will send it to you. Mr Allaimby has visited Utah, and has in his possession a letter  from President John Taylor. He offered me any needed as- sistance in his power, For which I was thankful.  Since coming to Constantinope I have labored with the  question of recognition. I move slow & I find it Benificial. Dr. Angel, the Minister received me kindly but left at once 
 After encouraging the saints to faith- fulness at Aintab & having arranged all matters as best we could we left Presi- dent Maycock & the Saints June the 7th for [Shusni Mansur] whence we had re- ceived a number of pressing invitations to come and baptize etc. Our caravan being a large one we had no police or soldier with us. In four days we arrived safely & found that the whole town was in one stir about us and our coming. The wildest rumors about our giving many wives & much money to all who would join had deceived many who had such bugs in their brains. Could we have complied with their wish we could have done great business. But when they found our business of a quite different nature, that we required faith & works, that we received from members, tithing etc, & did not give the whole thing flatened with that crowd. In the mean time we had been visited by the police, my teskere (pass) & books had been taken to the police station, and a charge or suspicion had been trumped up by the 
 (second sheet)  for the United States. The Charge d'Affaires, Mr John Riddle has assited me very willingly. He at once sent  a dragoman to the Government ^to find out^ how to proceed in this  matter, and finally we were refered to the Minister of Religions,  Mr. Ziver Bey. He remembered me from former visits. He explained  to us that it was nessesary first to send the petition to Alepo and  have it signed by the native Elders of our Church, then to the  Vali who would investigate if we had a people there and certify  to the findings. Then the petition would come here and be  considered by the sublime Porte. This government could not recogni- ze us as we are foreigners but it would consider a petition from its own citizens. He promised his assistance. He has read and  formally excepted the petition with a slight correction and it is  now ready to sent to Sivas & Alepo. Please find a copy with this report in seperate envelope marked A.  Just at the time of getting up this petition I was in a little trouble how to begin and where to get assistance. Mr. Riddle pre sented me with a ticket to go to Selamlik, to see the Sultan  drive to the Hamidiea Mosque to prayer. I attended and upon  my return I was hailed by Brother Binyad, our Greek brother &  a sort of lawyer by profession. We were so pleased to meet. After  investigating his condition I sent him to find out from some  high officials all he could of how we should proceed & he re turned a report identical with Ziver Bey's advise. He at once  struck up a plan or form which was excepted as above stated. Ziver Bey & the Legation people promised such aid as we would  need when the petition comes back. And Mr. Garqiula the  Legation enterpreters presence upon each visit gave a great deal of force to my position. 
 Protestants & the Government to gather that we were agitators. They telegraphed to the Mutesarif at Malatia who ordered us sent there. As a foreingnor I refused to be confirmed or even to acknowledge arrest and it seems that they did not dare to handle me roughly. I went in and ^out^ of the police room as I pleased & told them that they could choose one out of two, either let me live at the khan, were we had a room, until they got ready or send me at once as I possitively refused to go willinging into confinement without a charge ^complaint^. They chose to send us at once & in a short time we were sent out of town, a horse back at our own expence, under two gaurds to Malatia, Of course we suffered a great deal of indignity from a worldly standpoint but we were happy. Brother Nishan proved a great healp to me as he was used to such indignities has advise had a good effect. My obstainasy saved us from further trouble & in two days, we i. e. part of three days travel we were at Malatia. The road, or trail, was of the roughest I ever traveled & still entitlled to the name of 
 As these men at the Legation & General Consulate would not take any backshish for services, I offered them a  Book of Mormon as a present from the Church. They seemed  very much gratified with the proposition & would except the  books with thanks. I have therefore ordered a Book of Mor mon for Mr. Garqiula & a Voice of Warning for Mr. Dimitri  adus of the General Consulate, from Bern as they desire French. I hope you will approve of this as it is an easy, and may be a  benificial way to remember them and to show our appricia- tion of their assistence which we may need much more  in the future. The cash expences of the petition will be about five^eight^ Dollars.  I called on Mr. Dickensen Consul General To Turkey. He re ceived me very cordially & answered my questions without reserve. He said that America had better treaty rights with turkey than  any other nation, and that we were perfectly secure in property holding  in Turkey, that is, said he, as secure as ^a^ governmeent like this can  make it. He said the Turkish Government lived up to the treaty  better than the Americans, & that he was sorry that there were some  Americans who seem to think it an honor if they could defy the  Turks or say something to offend them under the Juristection  of the U.S. Government. Mr. Dimitriadus, the vice Consul &  sec. of the Consulate has furnished me a copy of the protocal &  enterpretation of our priviledges relating to property rights, and secu rity from interference by Turkish officials. The copy is also  made part of this report and is marked B.  I would ask these questions. Is the gathering limited  to Palestine? And further, Shall I look toward a petition to the  Porte for land for our saints if we are successful with the  petition for recognition? 
 malil route. Over mountain passes, down washout's, crossing several ranges the trail being many places very dangerous. At Malatia we were soon released, or told there was no change. We were told we were not arrested but that as the road was un safe (also true) we were only gaurded from the robbers etc. This was a cute explaina- tion. My pass & books had been seized & sent here under double seal. I gave them to understand I quite knew the difference between arrest & liberty. It was clear that we were not entirely free as the Mu- tesarif desierd we should lodge in the barracks telling us it was better that the filthy khan. I thanked him but told him if I was free I would go to the khan a little discussion issued between themselves, and the police commissioner, who proved to be a gentlemen, came & told us we might go to the Khan. They evidently were figuring on some plan to let us go, which is not the easiest thing in the world in this land were no one seems to know just what to do es- pecially in cases envolving foreignors. 
 I ask these questions now that I may receive an answer  in time to continue my labors when I come back to  Constantinople if required. I expect to leave this week for Pa lestine to see the Gire' property & Palestine in Sept. according  to the instructions from Apostle Lund. Afterwards I will go north  to Alepo to help the petition work there. And if you think  proper I will investigate chances for land in Northern  Syria. As for the natives I see no more to fear from them than we had to fear from the Indians in Utah. There are dif ficulties but they can be overcome by the Lord's assistance. Go where we will and we shall find difficulties to surmount  but if we begin right by sending enough foreigners to our  place of settlement to beget confidence & ^to^ establish respect and  confidence in the movement we will soon be alright. A foreign hat is a great power in Turkey.  A friend and investigator Mr. Negro, a Polish Gentlemen of fine education & attainments came here as an exile from Poland. He is now a Turkish subject & has worked for years for them as an ingeneer. He also states that there is plenty  of land to be had in Syria & that good tittles can be had. A  little backshish is needed. Then let a man who is a citizen  & in whom we have confidence buy & imidiately trans fer to an American. He has extensive experience in land  matters. I became aquainted with him 10 years ago and he seems  like and exceedingly good man.  In regard to the mission in General I believe  it is progressing favorably. The probability of a place  of gathering gave a good deal of new life and energy as  it does in all countries. This is natural to the Gospel. 
 We left the barracks, however, & went to the Khan were we found to our surprise that we had a guard placed over us. I at once sent a nother soldier to notify the government that I positively objected to any such indignity. The soldier was prompt- ly removed. It was some time before we could decide washat was coming next. But it soon dawned on us that the Mustesarif had telegraphed the Govenorrnor at Kharpoot for instructions. The Vali telegraphed back that in as much as we were desirous of going to Sivas not to hinder us, but to give me back my books, & examine any Armenian papers found. This was com- plied with. Our Armenian writings were endorsed O. K. by the Commissionor. So far so good, but it was not until two days out from Malatia that we were noright sure that we were not in some un- derhanded way being sent to Sivas. But one of the Gen I'arneo hwho ackcompanied us was induced to show us his papers by speaking of the general method of protecting travelors. This was a great relief to us. As I was all the 
 New hopes have been engendered by this prospects of the  realization of the promises to the House of Israel.  I have  not heard whether or not Brothers Vizirian and Nadjarian  have been released from prison, but they are reported as  bearing faithful testamonies in their cell in Diarbekr and  they have found believers, Those men are very energetic.  I would reco^m^mend that one or two more experienced  Elders be sent here. And that each Utah Elder traveling  has a native Brother as his assistance. The native Bro- ther to act as interpretor, He can do the preaching, as a rule, better than we. It also helps to put the Utah Elder in good stan ding before the Government & people. The actual expence of  keeping a native Elder is not much. And alone the native  can do nothing. The situation has entirely changed since  the massacre. Natives are under restrictions all the time &  are not safe from arrest unless in the imploy of some  foreignor. And Foreingners must put themselfves in a position  to hold the respect of the people by the dignity & authority which  our treaties and consular aid affords, otherwise we are  liable to arrest and much trouble. We hope this condition  will soon change but until then we must proceed in  some such way to preach the Gospel in Turkey. Turkey  is a peculiar country with peculiar laws and customs, &  very strange ways of inforcing them as few persons under  stand the laws. But if they think you are in Good standing in Stamboul or well backed by your own Government they  look upon you as Lords. And it is very profitable & convenient  to have them continue to think so. A show of superiority seems  necessary. The people here must look up to some authority 
 time more anxious about Bro Nishan than about myself. I knew at Sivas was a U. S. Consul who would protect one while if Bro. Nishan should be taken from me in anyway it m^i^g^ht^ prove a heaard case for  him, besides hurting his enfluence at Zara, his home, where hise is the leading Christian citizen. We are thankful that God delivered us & that at this writing we ^have^ passed police examination and all is well. It is awful to think that men whose acts are strickly honest & whose conscience is clear & who try earnestly to comply with the law of the land shall still fear & tremble at meeting & officer lest something unfore- seen shall turn up and one be mistrusted. At Husni Masur a good and faithful testomony was left to hundreds. At Ma- latia only little was done beyound destributing track. We felt that our liberty depended largely upon our leaving town soon so we left at once otherwise we would have been sent to Kharpoot the  Governor's seat and of the case had been augmented from there to Constantinople. The lower officers at Husni 
 Mansur tryed hard to fix suspicion on my journal. This they could not read & it came back unread. While it is free from any thing obnoxious to the Ottoman Government Yet it contains much important matter pertaining to our special mission which might for a while have put me in ^a^ wrong light & done us injury. but all is now well. This trap was set by the College people at Aintab of whom Bro. Lund will tell you. they have notified their preachers near & narefar of our intentions of visiting their cities. They have been instructed to notify the city authorities that we are sedicious & un- recognized therefore have not rights. Theis was a smart trick. We have been told the whole scene by Army officers &  others who deplored our fate but could not help us. Now that it is over it is clear to me that the time is ripe for an ap- plication to become recognized. This ex- perience wisely used will furnish an excelent-opening wedge. Not as a complaint but as a reason to our Minister at Con- stantinople to whom I hold a special 
 (third sheet)  in man which they themselves do not possess. When they see a superiority then they are humble and submissive. This is their education for centuaries, with them it is second  nature. If we try to be their equals, as the Gospel teaches, and as we  would naturally like to be, we destroy our influence, To the mem bers we may be what the Gospel teaches, but to the others we must  appear above.  I thank you for the appropriation fo  the schools in Turkey. At Zara a young sister is instructing the  children of the saints & it works very well. I have not  heard ^what^ is being done at Aintab aboout the school. Bread has gone up at Constantinope and it is possi ble our Saints at Aintab will have to be assisted as  they will undoubtedly be short of food when winter comes. Work is so poor that it seems at best as though it would  keep no one. They manage, however, if they can only find  work. I think the saints in Livas & Zara will not suffer. The crops are good there, bread is cheap & work better than  at Aintab. The saints at Haifa continue the same. Sister Hilt continues unwell I am sorry to say. She is the  soul of that branch.  Personally I am well as I believe President  Maycock & Elder Larsen are. Individually I feel well in the  Gospel & take great pleasure in my labors. Yet I confess that the trial to leave home & family has been much  greater this time than ever before. And then I feel a  great responsibility connected with this whole mis sion. So long as I had the pleasant copmpany and advise of  Apostle Lund I was all right but now I feel lost often 
 in these ever changing conditions.  In conclusion I would ask you kindly to  write me a few lines to Alepo c/o Dr Arminag. That I may know your wish about some of these  important questions.  Also that President Wells be  notified of the monies we are allowed from time  to time so that we will meet with no trouble in  obtaining them when needed. Inclosed please  find enclosed my financial Report.  With kindest regards to you all & to the  Brethern of the Twelve and other enquiring friends, and ever praying for God to be with you and bless  you I remain as ever your obedient fellow  servant.

The Consular here at Sivas asked of Mr. Lund & told me that he had been notified of our coming.  I have now decided that the right thing to do is to return to Haifa by way of Constantinople. For these reasons. First, the country is not yet thouroughly settle after the Armenian troubles which must have cost over 50,000 lives. Whole destricts being cleaned out. And their leading men all killed. We as foreingnors are inspec- ted & native Elders without premission & some backing would be arrested, punished and sent home. It is exceedingly difficult for any one to obtain a teskere at all. Secondly, now that I can do nothing to speak of at present & holding this letter of introduc- tion, Also our people having influence with the Government at home I beleive it is 
 An opportune movment to make an effort to become recognized. We must be recognized before much of anything can be done. When recognized we will have great power.

The livy- ing of our own taxer in some cases & beyound all a name, whereas now we have none only with the Lord & His Servants which is good but we need it in this land also. We expect to buy land; this will also require recognition in time.  Now that correspondence is difficult &  slow asnd my time is short as I am to be in Palestine in September. I take the liberty to go to Constantinople to consult the U. S. Minister on the subject, & if it does not involve too great an& ex- pense, to apply for recognition, I will re- port to you at once & if it envolves over $5000 I will not proceed til I hear from you.

 Provo City, November 11, [189]1  President Wilford Woodruff.  Chairman General Board of Education.  Dear Brother,  In compliance with your isntructions concerning my educational tour to the church schools in Arizona, I have written to the each of the Presidents of Snow- flake, St. Johns, St. Joseph, and Maricopa Stakes, placing myself at their disposal during the time of my stay in their respective Stakes to fill any appointments they should deem proper to make for me in the interest of our church schools, Religion Classes, Sunday schools, & M. I. Associations.  The program of this tour is as follows:  Wednesday, November 18.  Start from Provo to Holbrook November 18 21.  Railroad from Provo to Holbrook. [November] 21 24.  Snowflake.

 Two new Seminaries have been reported to have been organised with the sanction of their respective Stake Boards.  The first is at Escalante, Gar- field County, for which, by request, I have nom- inated this day Bro. Martin I. Bushman, a Normal of the B. B. Y. Academy.  The second is at West Jordan, Salt Lake Co. As I have not yet been officially notified by that Local Board, but only by Counsellor Jos. E. Taylor in private conversation, I cannot make a definite appoint- ment, but have selected in my mind Bro. Eugene Hart, of Bloomington, Idaho.  Bro. Hart was until recently a teacher on the Bear Lake Stake Ac- ademy, Paris, but had to discontinue with the other teachers, except the Principal, on account of the financial embarrassment of that in- stitution.  Ever praying for the blessings of the Lord to rest upon you, I remain With kind regards, Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser 
 Provo, September 12th [189]1  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  Bro. James E. Talmage has just now left me after explaining to me your approval of the plan of having ^gotten up^ a series of textbooks for the three grades of religions instructions in our Churchschools, Sundayschools, Primaries [et. et.] When Bro. Talmage first sugges- ted this idea to me, I saw at once the great benefits that would probably be derived from such a step, in as much as I have realized for a long time the want of a religious textbook constructed upon correct Normal principles. Hence my enthusiastic endorsement of the Sunday school Leaflets, the first real step in that direction. With great joy I learned, therefore, of your approval of Bro. Talmage's plan, which he had laid before you upon my suggestion. Considering also the many difficulties which the introduction of the Religion-Classes is encountering in some Stakes, among which the want of proper methods is the most promin- ent, the publishing of suitable textbooks would remove many objections that have been raised against this wise move of the First Presidency. The Religious Classes is a supplement ^and effect^ to the secularisation of  our district-schools have become a necessity in 
 those Stakes of Zion, or Bishop's Wards, where the schools are in the hands of the opponents to the Latterday Work, and where Sunday schools and  Primaries, can with these new textbooks as guides, would prove too feeble bulwarks against the flood- of evil influences bearing down upon our children during the whole working school directed by in many cases professionally efficient teachers ^but opposed to our faith^. In some Stakes also noble work has already been done in those Religion-Classes, promising a further de- velopment, especially when assisted by those books in contemplation, the results of which cannot be measured by human calculation.  The question of authorship appears to me very simple as for the qualification is concerned, in as much as we have no educational author thus far among as equal to Dr. James E. Talmage. If he shall find time for this work depends en- tirely upon the direction of the First Presidency. I shall take great pleasure in rendering all possible assistance in this work, but Bro. Talmage ought to be the man to do it.  I have looked over with Bro. Talmage the manu- script for Gen. Circ. No. 7, and approve fully of his suggestions.  Bro. Woodbury has been recalled to Farmington and will see that your daughter Mary gets there also. He staid with me here yesterday.  With kind regards, Your brother in the Gospel,  Karl G. Maeser. 
 Provo City, April 13. [189]1  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In conversations held separately with Bros. Howard and Seeley, Counselars of President Larson of Emery Stake, during Conference, and by letters from Bro. Eli A. Day, Principal of their Stake Academy, I discovered such a hopeless case of disunion existing in the Stake Board of Education, that steps leading to an improvement in this state of affairs become imperative. Both Principals, the one of the Stake Academy at Castle Dale, and the other of the Seminary at Huntington are completely discouraged. The latter has quit already and has gone home, and the former wants to quit at the end of this term, and intends to attend^ the Normal Course at the B.Y. Academy for a term or two, if he shall get a chance.  He has been arrested again during Confer- ence on the ongoing charge, having served already a term in the pen.  It appears from all that I can learn, that the old jealousy between Huntington and Castle Dale, especially on the part of the former place, led by Bros. Howard and Johnson, is handicapping all the operations of the Stake Board, of which Bro. Howard is the nominal President. Bro. Larsen, the Stake President, being no member of the Board at all on account of some mistaken modesty of his. 
 As this is a matter concerning Board affairs I have no authority to give instructions, but report the case to you. Counselor Seely implored me to see that something be done, and I promised him that I would lay this case before for you, so that relief from this strained condition of affairs could be obtained.  With kind regards, Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser  1. P.S. Bros Geo. W. Ingram, of Mesa, and Geo. A. Crosby, of St. George, have been placed on the Beneficiary list of the Normal Dept. of the B.Y. Academy for next year, as director, and been duly notified of the fact.  K.G.M.  2. P.S. I enclose letter from Randolph which explains itself. What and how shall I answer Bro. Larsen?  KGM.

 Provo City, January 19th [189]2  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother,  At an official visit I paid yesterday to the Brigham Young Academy, taking notes, attending the recitations of the teachers, and meeting with the Faculty after school in special session, of which proceedings I shall make due report to you in connection with my report of my southern circuit commencing with today I found that all the teachers of the Brigham Young Academy, teaching academic studies, are using officially the title "Professor" on the bulletin-boards and elsewhere in the Academy. As this is against the rule adopted by the General Board of Education, laid down in General Circular No. 7, page 5, I objected to this at the Faculty- meeting. None of these teachers, except Professor Cluff, who has his Diploma, holds even a License for these academic studies. Several of them have handed to me last night their applications for Licenses in their re- spective academic studies, endorsed by Prof. Cluff as Principal. I have filled out blanks accordingly and submit them herewith respectfully for your con- sideration. These teachers solicit the permission of 
 nan 
 the General Board to use the title "Professor" on the strength of these Licenses, as they are ready to pass their examination for the "Academic Degree" next spring.  According to your instructions to submit my opinion on all pending questions in Church School matters, I venture to state, that this question does not concern the teachers of the Brigham Young Academy alone, but can be applied to the Colleges at Salt  Lake and Logan as well. The granting of the request of the B.Y.A. teachers would necessitate, therefore, some modification of the paragraph in the Gen. Circ. No. 7, above alluded to.  I shall return from Fillmore to Provo, Friday, Jan. 29th, when I should be pleased to receive any instructions from you on this point, or can call on you any day between January 30 and February 1st.  With kind regards Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser

 Provo City, March 2d [189]2  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  According to program submitted in my letter to Bro. Reynolds, January 15, I have visited in the interest of our Church School Organization the Stakes of Juab, Millard, Emery, Sanpete, and  Sevier from January 19 until February 26; attended during that  period the Stake Academies at Nephi, Fillmore, Castle Dale, Ephraim, and Richfield, and the Seminaries at Hunting- ton, Manti, and Gunnison, spending in each of these schools  one whole day, from the opening exercises in the morning  until the closing exercises in the afternoon; taking notes,  examining the the records required in Gen. Circ. No 7, page 17; met with the respective Faculties for consultation; and met  also with the Stake and the Local Boards to ascertain the  condition of their general affairs.  Appointments by the  Stake Superindendents for me to address public meetings  were made at Nephi, Fillmore, Meadow, Kanosh, Deseret,  Scipio, Holden, Huntington, Castle Dale, Ferron, Orangeville, Ephraim, Manti, Gunnison, and Richfield, at all of which  occasion our Church Schools and Religion Classes were the leading subjects; Sunday Schools, Primaries, and Mutual Improvement Associations, as corroborate institutions, re-

Students in attendance at our Church schools during the first half of the present scholastic year have been registered  a; according to Sex as  2091 Males and 1728 Females = Total 3819.  b; according to Grade:  in the Normal Departments: 186  [in the] Academic [Departments]: 280  [in the] Intermediate [Departments]: 1857  [in the] Preparatory [Departments]: 807  [in the] Primary [Departments]:  689 = Total 3819.  Four Church schools, however, have not yet reported, but their atten- dance according to insidental information would aggregate about 550, which would make our whole attendance until January 1st about 4369.  It will be seen from these Statistics that the introduc- tion of the Freeschool System in our District Schools has not materially ^interfered^ with our attendance.  IV.  Studies.

 ceiving due attention in all my public addresses. The school's, without one exception, have been better patronized than the previous year and a marked  progress toward permanency is observable in all of  them.  The only drawback is the financial embarrass- ment under which some of them are laboring yet. There is one feature, however, to which I take the liber- ty of calling the attention of the General Board for  the earliest possible consideration viz:  The annual change  of Principals in many of our Church Schools, in con- sequence of which such schools can never ^hope to^ emerge out  of the experimental stage and to reach a leading po- sition ahead of the District Schools at least not to  a very pronounced degree.  The main reason is the  comparatively poor salary, and the absence of any pro- spective improvement in this regard, forcing us to  supply these schools every year or so with new be- ginners, as their predecessors are compelled to seek  for better chances elsewhere.  A proposition has  suggested itself to my mind which, if it can be car- ried out, might circumvent this difficulty.  I should  suggest an addition to any Principal's salary after five  years' service in one school, and so on after every five years more until a stipulated maximum should be reached.  With kind regards,  Your brother in the Gospel,  Karl G. Maeser, Gen Supt

 Provo City, March 21st [189]1  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother, Last Thursday morning I presented the two letters to Pres. A. O. Smoot and to Bro. George Cluff respectively.  The latter intends acknowledging the reciept of his letter forth with, but with the former some very earnest conversation ensured, a report of the main features of which I herewith respectfully submit. Calling at Pres. Smoot's office Thursday morning after mailtime, I found him and Bros. D. John and H. H. Cluff, a waiting me being, it appears, privately advised by Bro. B. Cluff that some important com- munication was to be made to them.  After the reading of your letter, feeling began to run very high, and the message of Pres. Geo. Q. Cannon delivered by me verbatim did not seem to carry any conviction with it.  The arguments of the Bretheren of thie Stake Presidency was as fol- lows:  1. Whenever a young man of talent had been made an efficient teacher in the B.Y. Academy, he had been taken away, the school left in a crippled condition until some  one else became qualified to be  taken away in his turn, vide Bros. Tanner, Talmage, Maeser, and now Cluff. 2. The B. Y. Academy were the mother institution of our church schools the most of whom were conducted by Graduates of this insti- tution; she had proved her integrity to the First Presidency and to whole Israel, and it would not be wise to break down a welltried institution for the sake of building up an experimental one.

 Provo City, March 21st  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother,  Last Thursday morning I presented the two letters to Pres. A. O. Smoot and to Bro. Benj. Cluff respectively.  The letter intends acknowledging the recipt of his letter forthwith, but with the former some very earnest conversation ensured, a report of the mainfeatures of which I herewith respectfully submit talking at Pres. Smoot's office Thursday morning after mailtime. I found him and Bros. D. John and H.H. Cluff awaiting me being it appears, privately advised by Bro. B. Cluff that some important com- munication was to be made to them.  After the reading of your letter feeling began to run very high, and the message of Pres. Geo. Q. Cannon delivered by me verbatim did not seem to carry any conviction with it the arguments of the Brothern of this Stake Presidency some as fol- lows:  1.  Whenever a young man of talent had been made an efficient teacher in the B.Y. Academy, he had been taken away, the school left in a crippled condition until some one else became qualified to be  taken away in his turn, [vide] Bros. Tanner, Talmage, Maeser, and now Cluff.  2.. The B.Y. Academy were the mother institution of our church schools the most of when were conducted by Graduates of this ins- tution; she had proved her integrity to the First Presidency and to [whole] Israel, and it would not be wise to break down a welltried institution for the sake of building up an experimental one.

 3.  That just now arrangements had been made, donations raised from public sources with intentions been published for the enlarge- ment of the Commercial Department and the establishment of a "Kindergarten" in connection with the B. Y. Academy.  4. That the deeds and consequences of the real estate were now in the hands of the Board of Trustees, and that the latter had receised very encouraging assurances from all the leading businessmen of Provo, in and out of the Church, to support them in their efforts to dispose of real estate at once, and finish the new Academy-building, but that all these efforts would be frustrated, as soon this new blow at the prosperity of the institution would become known.  That the people would say there were no use trying to do anything here, for the Authorities at Salt Lake wouldwill continue to take always our best men away.  I suppose that the Board of Trustees will meet here next week, when it is intended to have your letter discussed and answered officially.  My report is merely for the purpose of posting you in regard to the prevailing sentiments here in regard to this matter.  Not sharing myself the spirit of despondency in this case,  but seeing that I could make no impression upon the Stake Presi- dency, I invited all the teachers of the B. Y. Academy to a private consultation at my office, yesterday afternoon.  Except Bro. B. Cluff, all were present and each expressed his determination to stand by the Academy now, although the most had intended to re- sign at the end of the schoolyear before anything of the contemplated change was known.  They desi[re] that President 
 Provo City, May 26th [189]1  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In as much as the time for our Annual Church School Convention is near at hand, it becomes my duty to submit to you a few suggestions for your consideration to instruct members of the General Board present at the occasion to bring what extent they might bring before the Convention any or all of them, or other points of importance which you may desire to have them speak upon.  1. It has been noticed with regret that several Church Schools have not yet made arrangements that the copies of the Juvenile Instructor, containing the "Church School Papers", are kept on file for reference, in consequence of which omis- sion many of our Church School Teachers are kept in ignorance of this content.  2. As the Religion-Classes are an appendage to our Church School Organization, and as such are under the control of the respective Stake Boards of Educa- tion, and the Principal of the Stake Academy, whereas practicable, should act as Stake Superintendent over these classes, but the majority of our Religion-Class- Instructors are not professional teachers, all our 
 nan 
 continued  Woodruff would kindly permit the B. Y. Academy to use Bro. Mae- ser's name for next year as Principal, and that Pres. Smoot be re- quested to secure the services of Bro. Geo. Brimhall, Principal of the Provo District Schools, as teacher for the Normal Department. With these arrangements being granted, they were willing to labor on at any sacrifice for the sake of bridging over the trying position into which their dear Academy were just now placed.  They all have received their training, spiritual and mental, in the Academy, and owed this debt of gratitude to her.  There was much emotion exhibited in that meeting.  Last night I had a private interview with Pres. Smoot at his residence, by appointment.  By representing to him the fact that the B. Y. Academy had passed through many and severe struggles, among which the ordeal of fire was not the least, and had been gaining in spite of all that in influence and usefulness, and had manifestly enjoyed the approval of the Lord and His Servants, she would continue to hold her own as long her Board and Faculty would keep in the line of the Spirit of the Gospel. I told Bro. Smoot that the First Presidency were loyal to the B. Y. Academy, and that, in establishing a much needed Univer- sity at Salt Lake, for the purpose of eventually stopping that pernicious annual exodus of our young people to  Eastern 
 regular Church-School-Teachers should render us all possible assistance in the further development of that great work.  3. It is very desirable that a report of the complete or- ganization of these Religion Classes should be received from every stake of Zion on or before Sept. 15.  4. Many of our "District-Conventions" have passed through the experimental stage, and are in good working order. Several Branch Conventions have been organized for the greater convenience of far off members, and promise to become soon independent District-Conventions. As the office of Chairman of Convention has been found to develop into one of great responsibility, it is thought best that the General Board should reserve ^to itself^ the nominations for that office.  5. Attention is called on it more to the instructions given in our General Circulars that no branches of studies should be announced in Church School Annuals, was placed into the Curriculum, for which there is not ^properly^ licensed or certificated teacher in that school. This rule applies also to Normal Classes in Stake Academies.  6. The unprecedented development of our Church Schools Organization recalls to mind the ia discussion in the General Board of Education preceding the issuance of one of the General Circulars, when it was understood 
 High Schools, it was not intended to interfere in the least with the  noble mission which the B. Y. Academy was performing. The First Presidency had called away, it is true, thus far the leading teachers from the Academy, but simply for the reason that there had been no others available at the time, and not for the reason of keeping down the Academy. Bro. Smoot feels some what more encouraged, and instructed me to see Bro. Brimhall for the purpose above alluded to.  In connection with this B. Y. Academy affair, I beg leave to call your attention also to the B. Y. College at Logan. Bro. JM. Tanner has an- nounced his intention to go East after the close of the schoolyear, and study also for a year or two as Bros. Talmage and Cluff have done in order "to be even with them". Now, there is the Agricultural College at Logan with its financial advantages gaining influence and power in ever increasing ratio. The B. Y. College  must not be suffered to be swamped by that Gentile Institution, which it certainly would be, if Bro. Tanner, who has been working up a fine spirit among the young people there, leaves and no suitable man to continue the work. Suitable is only one that comes with an already established reputation. There are hundreds of young mean in Israel that will be in a short time just as good and probably better than any ofthe present known Educators among the Latterday Saints, but they have to make their reputation first. I have no one to suggest as suitable to carry on the work, if Bro. Tanner should leave this year. If you could induce Bro. Tanner to stay one more year the difficulty 
 continued  by the members present that it would take about five years before our contemplated standard of efficiency could be reached. Two of these five years have now passed, and although much has been accomplished, a by far greater work is yet bifore us to attend to. Among the many problems awaiting solution is the one that requires all desirous of occupying the high responsibility of Principal of a Stake Academy to hold the "Academic Degree." It is to be hoped that this point can be reached within the remaining three years.  7. The permanency of the position of Principal is another point of vital importance, the attainment of which no Board of Education can afford to lose sight of. Not only is the annual change in the Principalship deterimental to the best interests of the school in the special instances, but ^also^ has a tendency of lowering the startndard of the whole profession, in not giving security to talented persons for permanent homes and for the creation of personal influences for golasting good in any given locality.  8. Fully realizing the financial difficulties the most of our Boards of Education have to contend with, 
 continued  may ^be^ successfully met.  A very similar case presents itself at the Millard Stake Acad- emy, Fillmore. President I. N. Hinckley has obtained from Governor Thomas the use of the "State House" at Fillmore, and is now engaged with his Brothern to secure the building for a long term of years by a well fortified Lease. This move will require some extra financial ex- ertion on the part of the Saints in that Stake, but just at this junc- ture, Bro. Josiah Hickman, the Principal of the Stake Academy, intends to resign for the purpose of taking a higher course at the L.D.S. College. I bound myself by my word to him last year, not to raise any objec- tion to his leaving this year, if he would hold on another year, as I had no suitable successor then, Bro. Hickman having done a splendid work down there and became the idol as it were of his Board, Students, and the People. That makes it very difficult for any one to follow after such a man, for everything he does or say will be measured by the standard of his predecessor. Pres. Hinckley requested me to use my influence with Bro. Hickman to remain an- other year until the S. Academy should be fairly started in the new building. As my word had been given to the contrary, I could not do so, but Bro. Hickman will abide by your counsel in the matter. He will call on you on the subject.  There is a great deal of diffidence on the part of [several] 
 the General Board, nevertheless, can not urge earnestly enough the necessity of having the services of every Prin- cipal at least secured for the whole schoolyear, that is 40 weeks. For, if this cannot be done, we will be beaten in the long run. The District School Services is only too anxious to secure our best teachers by offers of pecuniary remuneration exceeding ours by far, and asking for less efficiency. We would only educate teachers practically for two or three years, in order to turn them over as experienced teachers into the District School Service. Teachers cannot be asked to labor always on missionary rates, or fill out the balances of the year with other occupations to make both ends meet.  9. It is very desireable that the Stake Presidents should be presiding over the Stake Boards of Educations whenever practicable, and that noone ^member^ should continue his membership in such a Board that is not willing to put forth his energies for the advancement of the respective school.  10. It has come to the notice of the General Board that the interests of our educational movement are greatly interfered with in some Stakes by local jealousies. Wherever this spirit has shown itself it has proven itself antagonistic to the true interest in Zion.  11. There is no Stake Board of Education in Cache Stake of Zion. The Board of Trustees of the B. Y. College at 
 Stake Presidents in regard to the introduction of these "Religion Classes", and one, President Smith of Davis Stake, told me at Farmington during the meeting, Sunday afternoon, that they did not need these classes in Davis Stake.  Questions have been asked me from many sides, if these Instructors in the Religion Classes, should not be set apart for their mission by their Bishopric? Although I am of the opinion that they should be, I had no authority to give such instruction. If this should be your mind, please to instruct me accordingly, that I could put it into the next "Church School Papers."  With kind regards, Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser 
 continued  Logan is composed in its majority of Brethren not be- longing to the Stake, I understand. As the Religion-Classes are under the direction of a "Stake Board of Education" some provision should be made in this regard.  12. As the Principals of the Stake Academies at Brigham City, ^and^ Ephraim, and also hold no Academic Diplomas as yet, but these Academics have appropriations for Junior Normal Classes, in what moment can these Principals be authorized to teach those classes? This point needs some adjustment in order to bring it in harmony with our general instructions.  13. Bros. Moench in Ogden, and Hickman in  Fillmore have also carried on for several years quite successfully some normal instructions, and raised a number of good district-school-teachers. It would prove almost disastrous to these two insti- tutions to discontinue that work for the future. No provisions for the examination in a course in Pedagogy have been made as yet, pending the instructions on the subject by the General Board in the revised edition of the General Circulars. What is to be done in these two cases for the time being 
 I should suggest an "Annual License" for all of these Principals, pending thesie examination for the "Academic Degree" in "Pedagogy", next year.  14. In compliance with the instructions of Gen Circ. No. 5. I reminded Bro. Moench in a letter of May 14, of the necessity of completing his examination in Drawing, Music, & Logic in the Intermediate Grade which he had not done last year, thus not getting a Percentage in "General Efficiency." I also suggested to him the advisability of preparing himself for the "Academic Degree," as it became necessary for such an important place as Ogden to have its Church Academy presided over by a regular "Professor" by and by. This I wrote in an official letter, of which the copy is on file. In consid- eration, however, of the long and faithful services of Bro. Moench, I wrote him also a private letter of encouragement and explanation. All this Bro. Moench has answered by enclosed letter. I am in favor of Bro. Moench being granted his full papers for the Intermediate Grade without any further examination by order of the General Board, in consideration of his long and faithful services. But the "Academic Degree" he should obtain in the prescribed course of pro- ceedings. Please return his letter to me with your instructions.  15. From several directions have propositions been made by Church School Teachers to organize into a regular body for mutual support, to which end they ask for the privilege of electing a Committee 
 Provo City, November 6, [189]0  President Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother,  Since the opening of the present academic year, I have visited the Churchschools in Emery, Sanpete, Juab, Utah, and Salt Lake Stakes. In the first one of these, I found the Seminary at Huntington, James E. Brown, Principal, in a very satisfactory condition, there were already in the fourth week of its organization 42 pupils, all of the IV and V Reader Grades in attendance. No Lady-Teacher as yet, but called for since then, and will arrive there, probably next week. Large attendance anticipated for the winter season. Bro. Brown is a great favorite with the people & stake. Academy at Castle Dale, Bro. Eli A. Day, Principal, has only 16 stu- dents. Bro. Day was not sufficiently familiar with our system, but is a faithful and hardworking teacher. I parted him soon and made arrangements with him and Bro. Brown to meet often and harmo- nize their labors. Both schools in that Stake have separate houses to meet, Huntington ^Seminary^ being somewhat more conveniently fixed than the Stake Academy at Castle Dale. Both Boards are current- ly working for the good of their respective schools.  In Sanpete I had the pleasure in visiting at the inaugura tion of the Seminary at Manti, Andrew C. Nelson, Principal, of the Seminary at Gunnisan, Joseph Y. Jensen, Principal, [2] Manti Seminary  opened with 76 students and miss [Hon] 
 continued  during the Annual Convention to formulate some "Resolutions" [etc. etc.] to be published in the "Church School Papers."  16. Committees to be appointed: a. On Calendar. b. On Music. c.

Dear Sir,  Your favor of the 5th inst., signed also by Professors Morton and Benner, notifying me of my appointment for an address on the subject of "Teacher" before the Territorial Teachers' Association in the afternoon of June 22nd, is as received yesterday.  Duly appreciating the honor thus conferred upon me, I shall endeavor to fill the ap- pointment to the best of my ability.  Very respectfully yours Karl G. Maeser [end of sideways text]

 as lady-teacher.  The school is well furnished, occupies two commo- tions classrooms in a house within the Tabernacle-enclosure, and was in fine working order the second day after the inaugaration.  The Gunnison Seminary occupies the Relief Society House, and opened with 28 students but with fair prospects of large increase.  An upper room is being rapidly put into shape for [days purposes] Both principals of these institutions are earnest and [illegible] expect most school-wor- kers and are endeavering to ma[ke] [3 illegible words] actions perma- nent intending to settle down this [illegible 3 words].  The Stake Academy at Ephraim [Alm]a Greenwood Principal, has opened with about 25 students [illegible] of the of the Inter[med]iat and  Academic Grades, with expectations of a large attendance during the coming winter.  Bro. Greenwood is assisted by Bro. Wm. Winter.  The Stake board owns a large building, occupied at present by the District school, but wont take possession next year. The course of studies in the Academy is very creditable to the teachers, both in regard to the spirit, methods, and organiza- tion, as well as to the results.  The Mt. Pleasant Seminary, Bro. Geo. Christensen, Principal, and Miss Augusta Erickson, Assistant, has opened its second school year with but 24 students, of the Intermediate and Preparatory Grades, occupying at present only one classroom Bro. Christensen being one of our best churchschool-teachers, exercises a most beneficent influence over the youth of Mt. Pleasant, and it is only to be feared, that the Authorities there may overload him with too many appointments, on the 
 continued  principle of the "willing ox".  Although the Local Board at Manti will have a schoolhouse of its own in another year, when the board of the School-Trustees expires, some assistance will become ne- cessary, in as much as the Presbyterians are erecting a beautiful Academy-building, and propose to fit it up with all the appur- tenances of modern education in order to swamp our Seminary. All the Boards of Education in Sanpete, with Pres. Peterson at their head, and strongly supported by Apostle Lund, are doing their utmost to advance the cause of their youth.  The Juab Stake Academy, at Nephi, Bro. Wm. H. Jones, Principal, and Miss Mattie Nelson, Assistant, opened Oct. 13. with 37 students in two Departments, Intermediate and Primary.  The house is well- furnished and reflects much credit upon the energy and good judgement of the Stake Board.  The people of Nephi seem to be  in earnest to support their churchschool.  Bro. Jones is getting quite readily into line with our educational system, in which he is ably supported by Mrs. Nelson, who is as Graduate of the B. Y. A. familiar lady with it.  The attendance at that Academy has increased considerable since opening.  The L.D.S. College 18 Ward Seminary, 14 Ward Seminary, and Central Seminary at the Cottonwoods, have also been visited by me and found in a flourishing condition.  These 
 four institutions of Salt Lake Stake had a full attendance at the  first day of opening, so that many more refused admittance for want ofo room.  I should suggest that at least two more Seminaries be organized in S.L. City, one in the northwest and one in the southeast, and then another one somewhere over Jordan in the southwestern part of the county, or at Draper.  The new Seminary organized at Parowan, and opened Oct. 13. with Bro Edwin Cutler, Principal, reports very favorable progress and the people of that place seem to be determined to support their own churchschool with all their might.  Many causes have combined this year to create a considerable iregularity in the time of opening of our churchschools, and in the applications for teachers, through which circumstances I have been placed several times into very perplexing situations. With the help of the Lord, however, these difficulties have been over- come thus far, and all our schools with the exception of Springville and Kaysville, are now in working order, Al all together.  At a meeting of the Stake Board at Ephraim the question was  raised, if donations should be given rather to the Stake Academy rather to the Temple.  I had no authority to give an answer, and submit it, therefore, to your decision.  It also was proposed at that occasion to divide the appropriation from the General Board with some Seminary, which is also submitted here with.  An objection to lady-students opening or closing the school 
 continued  with prayer, when students holding the Priesthood are present, has been raised by one of the Principals.  As I have never made any distinction in this regard between male and female stu- dents but have called on them from the list of volunteers for this purpose, I desire to be corrected, if I have been wrong in this.  In conformity with the motion carried at the last session of the General Board to organize our ^#1^churchschools into "District- Conventions" for the purpose of mutual improvement of our teach- ers and of the establishment of greater uniformity in the methods of teaching, I have proceeded in starting this movement; and organized "Districts" recording their geographical position as follows:  1. "Idaho District," comprising the churchschools at Oakley, Preston, Malad, Rexburg, Paris, and Randolph, with Bro. John H. Miles as temporary chairman, pending a permanent organization, which will have to determine, times and place of meeting, program, and appointments.  2. "Weber District," comprising the churchschools at Brigham, Ogden, Morgan, and Coalville, with Bro. L. F. Moench as tem- porary chairman, under above stated regulations.  3.  "Central District"  comprising the churchschools at 
 Heber, Provo, Springville, Nephi, and Fillmore, with Bro. B. Cluff as chairman. This district has already permanently organized, and holds its first regular session, Saturday Nov. 8, at Provo.  4. "Salt Lake District", comprising the L.D.S. College, 18 Ward, 14 Ward, and Central Seminaries, Davis Stake Academy, and Kaysville Seminary. This district is also permanently organized with Bro. J E. Talmage as Chairman. First session was held at the College, Saturday, Nov. 1. Committees on Program and on Ap- pointments were made.  5. "Sanpete District," comprising the churchschools at Hun- tington, Castle Dale, Mt. Pleasant, Ephraim, Manti, and Gunnison, with Bro. Alma Greenwood, as permanent Chairman. They are permanently organized, meet monthly at Ephraim or  Manti alternately, and their Program is also arranged.  6. "Mountain District" comprising the churchschools at Richfield, Fremont, and Panguitch, with Bro. A. R. Cutler as temporary chairman. No report as yet.  7. "Southern District" comprising the churchschools in Beaver, Parowan, Cedar, and St. George, with Bro. M. H. Dalley as tempo- rary chairman. They will meet next week to effect a perma- nent organization.  8. "Arizona District" comprising the churchschools at St. Johns, St. Joseph, and Snowflake, with Bro. J. W. Brown as temporary Chairman. No report as yet.  In consequence of the very scattered condition of some of those "Districts", as for instance of Idaho and Arizona 
 continued.  I have suggested to them to meet perhaps only once a year for a whole week or so, when I should endeaver to meet with them but that they should fill "written appointments" from time to time. Other "Districts" like the "Mountain District", No. 6. might meet quarterly, but the rest will probably meet monthly. I have suggested to them all that, in making up their programs, they should keep in mind the practice in writing Essays, deliver- ing Discourses and Lectures, Practical Exercises in Objectlessons, Classdrills, Demonstrations on different Methods, Questions and [An]swers, and Reports of their respective schools, and Critics.  It has also been suggested that some kind of an organ of  communication in regard to the doings of these various "Dis- trict Conventions" for the benefit of all under my editorship be selected, and the "Deseret News", the "Juvenile Instructor", and the "Contributor" have been named in this connection. I should be grateful to recieve your instruction on this point.  In conformity with my calendar of travel through the Idaho District, Coalville, and Heber back to Provo, from Nov. 12 to Dec. 132, as submitted to you through Bro. Reynolds, I shall be at Salt Lake City, Wednesday, Nov. 12, and should be glad, if Pres. Thos Ricks could wait for me until then, so that I could 
 go with him Thursday morning directly to Rexburg, as per ap- pointment. Bro. Ricks will be at Salt Lake next Saturday I under- stand.  Pres. A. O. Smoot has informed me that a new Board of Trustees of the B. Y. Academy has been formed and that I am a member of that Board. All the heirs of the B. Y. Estate have transferred their claims upon this Board (two excepted), and the new Board is to meet next Tuesday, Nov. 11. at 10 A.M. to de- liberate upon the feasibility of disposing of real estate be- longing to the Academy, for the purpose of raising means wherewith the erect the Academy building at the north- end of Provo.  Begging your pardon for this lengthy but necessary report I remain  Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser 
 Provo City, July 1st [189]3  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother  Bro. Geo. Reynolds' letter of yesterday, enclosing Elder B. Cluff's  of the day previous, has been taken into careful consideration. In connection with the subject in hand I enclose Bro. Cluff's  letter to me the wording of which seem to convey to me a some- what different shade of meaning from the one contained  in the letter to you.  While in the letter to you besides the  churchschool education in general, particular stress is  laid upon the normal training in the Brigham Young  Academy, in the letter to me the "advantages of the Acad- emy" without quedifiation are only mentioned.  When we remember the special efforts which the First  Presidency is now making through circular letters to all the  Stakes of Zion in instructing them to send eligible young  people to Provo for normal training in Sunday School Work, M. I. Asssociation Work, and having established  a Church Normal Training School, all in that institu- tion, besides my own labors in these interests, and keep- ing home missionaries for Sunday School and for M. I. A.  Work almost constantly among the people, and the host  of young people that are constantly issuing forth with much 
 Provo, December 10.  [189]2  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In conformity with the approved program, I left for  the first circuit of the present schoolyear for Price station  on the D. R. G. Ry, Oct 17, where I was received by a convey- ance from Huntington and taken to the latter place the  same afternoon. Pres. Larsen, of Emery Stake, having made  the necessary appointments for my labors in his stake, I had to leave for Castle Dale early the next morning, in  order to be there at the opening exercises at the Academy. The Principal, Bro. Alexander Jameson, is an earnest worker although in some branches somewhat below the average  qualifications, but diligently endeavoring to make up his  deficiencies. Unfortunately the payment of his salary  is very irregular on account of the financial condition  of the Academy, and he is obliged to own a little  store besides for the support of his family. This is in- jurious to the influence of the Academy, and at the  end of the present acad. year other arrangements in  this regard must be made.  In a conjoined meeting of  the Religionclass Instructors, Sunday School, and  M. I. Association Officers, I took occasion to refer 
 credit to their intellectual and spiritual advancement from  our churchschools it seems to me that the Lord is pleased  with the educational state of affairs in Zion thus far, and  if necessity for further efforts should arise, He would make  it known to you in His own way.  To send out teachers  from one single institution exclusively might have a  tendency to arouse jealousy in others and to break up that harmony of labor to a common end without which  the Spirit of the Gospel cannot be enjoyed.  In regard to the Church School Convention and ex- amination of teachers in Arizona, I shall notify all par- ties concerned, that all these exercises will commence the  day after the closing of the conjoined conference, and  continue the balance of the week.  Please to let me  know the date of the conjoined conference.  With the daily prayers for your full recovery, I re- main,  Your brother in the Gospel,  Karl G. Maeser

The following day, Oct. 19, I attended Huntington Seminary,  met with the Local Board, attended a Young Ladies'  Meeting, and addressed a Public Meeting in the evening. The Principal, Bro. Alonzo Wall, is a faithful and de- voted teacher, but as the Seminary is running only 12 1/2  terms in the year, he also is obliged to support him- self and family with outside labor, mostly farming. This  Seminary is in a far better condition, in attendance as  well as in general standing than the Stake Academy. The members of the Local Board are interested in their  school and are making great efforts to run the school  the full year in future. Bro. Jameson as well as  Bro.

 Provo City, January 2nd [189]3  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother,  The letter from the First Presidency, dated Dec. 31st 1892, announcing my appointment as one of the trustees of the U- niversity of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints, has just been received.  Thanking you for the confidence placed in me, I accept the appointment with the hope of being able to justify your trust by my faithfulness. I shall be at the meeting next Wednesday, at 2 P.M. the Lord being willing.  Embracing this opportunity to wish you, and Presi- dents Geo. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F.

Smith was waiting for me to take me  at once to Snowflake, where we arrived about midnight.  The Saints at Snowflake where disappointed by my not  arriving for their Sunday meetings. This disappoint- ment was caused by the bad and horrible road between Vernal and Price, compelling us to travel  three days instead of two, thus disarranging my  program by one day. Bro. Edward M Webb, the Principal of the Academy, had not yet commenced his labors to my  great regret. It appears that Bro. Webb had concluded to quit  teaching altogether and that only a short time ago the  Board succeeded in inducing him to resume his  labors. Bro. Webb is a fine teacher but thoroughly  discouraged for financial reasons, having a  large family to support. Meetings for S. S. Teachers,  M. I. A.

Left Snowflake for  Deming, Wednesday^Tuesday^, Oct. 21, and arrived at the latter place Thurs- day, Nov 3rd at 1 1/2 P.M. being met at the depot by Bp. W. D. Johnson.  Mexican Mission.  An hour later we were on our road for Mexico fully equipped  for night camping and long travel. Passed the Mexican  customhouse the next morning in a pouring rain which  continued the whole day and following night; the first  rain in that region, I am told, for nearly two years. Arrived at Diaz, Saturday, OctNov. 5 about 6 P. M.  The  same evening a reception was tendered me under the  auspices of a conjoined meeting of the M. I.  A.  The next day, Sunday, Sunday school, Public meetings in  the afternoon and evening, filled out my program for  the day, which was followed on Monday by attending  the Academy fore= and afternoon. This Academy  was started several years ago by Bro. Isaac Hayes, who conducted it for 3 years most succesfully, when  he suddenly died.  He was followed temporarily 
 Provo. May 27th  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In conformity with the arranged program for the fifth Council of which notice had been given to the respective Stake Presidents and Principals, I arrived at Logan, Tuesday, April 19; and accordinally received and hospitably entertained by Prof. J. H. Paul, Principal of the B.Y. College. Wednesday, April was spent exclusively in attending the classes exercises at the B.Y. College. It is with much satisfaction that I can report the fine condition of this College in regard to intellectual pro- gress as well as to spiritual standing and general discipline although it must be stated that it has been somewhat hard at first for Prof. Paul to partake of the spirit of our educational system; in as much as ^during^ the first few months of his labors at the College his usefulness was greatly im- paired by his vigorous participation in the struggles of the political drama and his theological instructions being fixed too much upon the [illegible] philosphies of the age, both of which mistakes Bro. Paul is mainly striving to overcome. It is to be regretted that by the time this efficient teacher, promising^es^ to become such a valuable co-laborer of ours, willing will leave the educational profession and 
 all the branches of This grade, including Kindergartenwork, having[ rensined ] her Normal training and been practical teacher for years in Holland:  I addressed the students of the College in the morning of Thursday, April 27; and left for Franklin, Idaho, in the afternoon.  A meeting of the Seminary Board was held at the Tithing office at 4 P.M., and the same instructions were discussed and unanimnously adopted that had been given at all the Boardmeetings during the previous Circuits.  I regretted exceedingly that the Seminary had closed, and the Principal, Bro. Thomas A. Condie, had left for his home in Morgan City, taking all the records with him in order to straighten them up before June 30.  Bro. Condie has written to me once, promising to have them returned [par-] ly made out before June 30.  I have also instructed Bro. Joseph G. Nelson, Principal of the Oneida Stake Academy, at Pres- ton, to examine those Records after their arrival, and report to me their condition.  It appears from the statements by mem- bers of the Board that Bro. Condie has not given entire satis- faction, having been any deficient in discipline.  This Seminary Board deserves much credit for their energy in providing a handsome building tolerable well furnished, and they are determined to keep in the lead in educational matters at Franklin, although there is a chance now in Idaho to get reliable trustees and teachers for the districtschools. 
 by Bro. Robert H. Smith, until the arrival of Bro. John H. Mills, the present Principal, recommen- ded by me for that position by a request of Bp. Johnson, to send someone that could speak  Spanish and understand Music. Bro. Mills has  proved a saviour to the school. The Academy is  crowded, he is assisted by two lady teachers, one of whom is his wife. The latter has to teach the  Primary Dept. in her own home as yet, as the  additions to the building had not been quite  completed. Too much cannot be said of the  devotion of Bp. Johnson, his counselors, and of  the people generally, in making their school a  success. The tuition is free to all the children of  schoolage. They people assess themselves for the  maintenance of the school and the completion  of their conjoined school-and meeting home. The affairs of the Academy were conducted thus  far by a Board of Trustees, previous to the  organization of a Central Board of Educa- tion under the direction of Apostle Teasdale. Tuesday, Nov. 8, we started for Juarez, arriving  at Dublan, about noon the following day.  Here we visited the school kept by Bro. Anson  Call, who followed us up to Juarez for the  purpose of making himself familiar with 
 trade his fine talents to law and politics in which pursuits he expects to find more adequate renumeration.  The College is sustaining a serious loss by the resignation of Bro. Kerr, who has accepted a call as Profesor of Mathematics at the University of Utah, his place is to be filled by Bro. Gowans from the B.Y. Academy of Provo.  Prof. Paul is ably sustained by his Faculty, among whom Bros. Todd and Apperly de- serve especial montion as the chief standard bearers of the spirit of the Latterday Work in the College. A very pleasing feature of the B.Y. College is the Preparatory Dept. in charge of Sister Hoving, an experienced Lady and Primary Teacher, and fervant Latterday Saint.  Like many other young talented, but ambitious teachers, Prof. Paul was inclined to build up higher classes for scientific and literary pursuits to the neglect of the foundamental branches of education. The objection to such a course does not lie merely in the fact that only comparatively for are prepared to take such courses and the expenses of maintening them would amount in some instances from $150 to $200 for each student per annum, but that such studies require the most eficient teachers of the Faculty, who have to donate their whole time to the instruction of perhaps 10 to 19 students in all, while their labors are taken away from about 200 who are just as much entitled to the benefits of their instructions. In follow- ing up this original inclinations, Prof. Paul intended you to dismiss Mrs. Hoving with her whole department of from 60 to 75 children in order to make room for 
 Provo, March 29th [189]2  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In conformity with the program for my fourth circuit, sub- mitted to Bro. G. Reynolds, on March 18th, I started for Ogden  the same day and met with the Board of Education of Weber Stake at 5 P.M;. ^On the following day, I^ visited the Sunday school of the Second Ward, addressed the public meeting in the afternoon, and the meeting of the Fifth Ward in the evening, on all of which occasions the proper training of the youth and the principles of our educational system furnished me the texts. Monday, March 21, attended the Academy the whole day, met again with the Stake Board after close of school, and ^by request^ gave a lec- ture to the Seventies in the evening. It is gratifying to report that the members of the Weber Stake Board of Education are all active workers in the cause, and under their ju- dicious management that Academy is forging its way to the frontrank among our educational institutions. I made them acquainted with the requirements which, according to the General Circular No. 8, soon to be pub- lished, would constitute a real Academy in our Church- School Organization. They are determined to obtain teach- ers of the required qualifications and grades for next 
 2. Oneida Stake Academy. Having arrived at Preston in the morning of Thursday, April 27. I had the privilege of attending all the exercises of the Stake Academy during the day.  As the Principal, Bro. Jos. G. Nelson had been engaged a greater portion of the academic year with princ concerns in order to establish himself permanently at Preston, an Assistant Principal in the person of Bro. David Hanson has been engaged, assisted by Sister Mete Nelson and Neils [E li] Benson, all of whom were found doing faithful and efficient work.  The records were in excellent order.  Although many of the students have to come daily to school large distances, some of them from 5-6 miles in various kinds of consequen- ces, and even the nearest of them have to walk about a half a mile through sleet, snow, and wind in wintertimes the attendance roll shows a degree of functuality and regularity surpassed only in a few of our churchschools The Academy building is nearing its completion, but the class work has got to be caried on in the basement.  I have to offer some severe criticism on the unnecessary ex- penditure for ornamental architcture in that building and the Board has accepted my suggestions of turning the two entirely superfluans side entrances into windows 
 our educational aims and purposes. Arriving at  Juarez. Wednesday, Nov. 9, about 5 P.M. we were kindly  visited by Apostle Teasdale, but have to go at once to  the Academy where all the students had been waiting  for our arrival to have the privilege of shaking hands  with us. There were 67 of them, with Bro. Dennis Harris,  as Principal, and two lady-teachers as Assistants. That evening  we addressed by appointment a conjoined meeting of the  M. I. A. the house being crowded to overflowing. The next  day I spent in the school. Bro. Harris has conducted this school at his own risk for several years most successfully and  desires to have his school fall into line with the whole Churchschool Organization. Pres. Teasdale organized  a Central Board of Organization for the Mexican  Mission, and also authorized  Local Boards of  Education to be organized for the Academy at  Diaz, and the Seminary at Dublan, the first two  Boards have sent in their application for recog- nition already, and Dublan will soon follow. There was another crowded meeting at Juarez, that  Wednesday^Thursday^ evening, and the following day,  Thursday ^Friday^ morning, we started on our return trip to 
 more academic classes composed of 3 or 4 students each. In my representation of the case to the College Board of Trustees, Prof. Paul was told that the Trustees would find the rooms for Sister Hoving and her pupils, as ^for as^ many as she could get. As Prof. Paul has practically demonstrated his earnest desire to fall into line with our educational system we fast so he can, It would be unfair to criticise too closely the deficiencies in the Records to be kept in every one of our churchschools ac- cording to Gen. Circ. No. 7, page 17, the more so as his pre- decessor, Prof. Tanner has not left them in as complete a condition as they should be. I have Bro. Paul's promise to have them in order by most academic years.  Thursday, April 20, I met with the Trustees of the College, to which meeting  by was attended by my, request by President Orson Smith and his counsellors. The organization of a Stake Board of Education was discussed and effected. The interview was one exceedingly pleasant one and will probably be practive- tive of much good in the educational interest of that Stake. I had the pleasure of adressing that same evening  perounded meeting of studented and patrons of the B.Y. College in the aims and spirit of our educational system.  By special invitation of Apostle Moses Thatcher I par- 
 year. The Faculty consists of the Principal, three male, and two lady-teachers. Neither of the two ladies, however, had undertaken thus far to qualify herself for the spe- cial instructions enjoined to be given in our church Schools by lady-teachers, according to Gen. Circ. No. 7,  page 18. The Board promised me that this feature should find ample recognition with the begin- ning of next academic year. This Academy has had about 200 students registered during this year, but owing to the late opening will have been in session only 27 weeks iat the end of this academic year. The new Academy-building, although not yet quite finished, is well of arranged for educational purposes, reflecting much credit upon the energy and good judgement of the Board. The Principal and Teachers are earnest workers, and are anxious to fully qualify for their work according to instructions in Gen. Circ. No. 7, pages 5-12.  Box Elder Stake Academy.  According to appointment, I arrived at Brigham City, Tuesday, March 22nd, at 1.30 P.M. and met with President R. Clawson, and another member of the Board, and the Principal, there being no Quorum present. The Stake Academy had closed for the year at the end of the third term, as it was sta- ted to me by President Clawson, on account of too small attendance. I called the attention of the bretheren to the instructions given on the subject in Gen. Circ. No. 7, 
 them not only saving several hundred hollars of expen- diture, but also obtaining greater comfort to teachers and students.  The great hall will be a magnifcent and reception hall, but as educational auditorium.  There was a Board meeting in the afternoon with full attendance, and the members felt unanimiuously to carry out the instruction given in behalf of the General Board.  The Faculty meeting was also attended by Pres. Parkinson.  The Principalship of this Academy is [illegible ] of particular [illegible ]just now, in  as much as Bis. G. Nelson, will have [illegible 3 words ]this year his  nomination for his Standing Certificate or finish his Nor- mal course first.

When that eautiful building will be ready for dedication and[ illegible] in full, it  should not be done on the makeship[ illegible] any more. That same evening I addressed a large[ illegible] in the Ward log homes, and held consultations with the teachers the day following.  Returned with Pres. Parkinson to Franklin where a public meeting was appointed for me in the evening, which was largely attended. Sudnay, April 30, I addressed the Sunday school of  Franklin in the forenoon, and left at noon with the U.P. train for Pocatello, where I had 
 ticipated in the exercises of the Conferences of the Relief So- ciety and Y. L. M. I Association of Cache Stake during Friday and saturday, April 21. & 22.  Starting for Franklin on the evening of the latter date.  Franklin Seminary.  Mrs. Esther Parkinson having been duly licensed as teacher for the Primary Grade at the beginning of the present academic year, and appointed to conduct a Primary School at Franklin, in lieu of a Seminary, and I, not receiving my report from there for a long time, made inquiries concerning the school. To my surprise I was in formed that the school had discontinued  and the new Seminary building being rent to the District School Trustees. I wrote an explanatory letter to President Parkinson in regard to the mode of procedure in such cases and obtained the promise of proper observance of our regulations for the future.  Oneida Stake Academy. After having participated in the meetings of the Oneida Stake Conference at Franklin during Sunday and  Monday, April 23 & 24, where opportunities two had been given me to urge upon the people the necessity of true education, I left in company with Pres. Joseph F. Smith and Apostles Lyman and Thatcher for Preston Monday afternoon, where a large meeting was held in the basementrooms of the yet our [illegible] Academy building. The meeting was crowded to  overflowing and addressed by Pres. J. F. Smith, Apostle Thatcher and Lyman, and myself. The Stake Academy had just closed its session, the previous Friday. 
 St. Joseph Stake.  I left Deming the same evening for Borine Station at  the Southern Pacific Ry, arriving there near midnight and  took the stage for Thatcher the next morning, arriving  there about 4 P.M. and was very hospitably received  by Pres. Christopher Layton. That day, Friday, attended  the Academy fore= and afternoon. The Principal, Bro. Geo. Cluff, is assisted by Mrs. Birdno, his sister. There is  some splendid work done by those two in that Academy,  although is not very largely attended just now, having  recieved quite a backset during the recent political campaigne, the Principal having been away on an sta- tioneering tour through Arizona for four weeks. Bro. Cluff is earnestly endeavoring to fill up his scattered ranks. In a Boardmeeting held on Saturday, many resolutions for the successful carrying on of the Academy and of the Religion classes were adoptive and Pres. Layton manifested a deep interest in  the matter. A meeting of the conjoined M. I. A. and Sunday School Officers concluded Saturday's proceedings. The following Sunday was spent at Pima filling three appointments as usual. 
 pages 4-5, that such a step should not be taken without consulting the General Superintendent, who is held res- ponsible to the General Board for his permission.  In this connection I feel it my duty to report, that many of our Stake and Local Boards seem to be too in different as yet to the instructions given by the General Board from time to time, and I should suggest, that repeated carelessness of this kind should not be left unnoticed in any appropriation for such a school the following year, or some other impressive remin- der be adopted, in order to emphasize in such cases, the injunctions of the General Board. This complaint refers also to the Church School Papers, published by order of the General Board. Bro. A. Vance, the Principal of the Box Elder S. Academy is a faithful and efficient worker, and he will probably ^make^ his permanent home at Brigham City, which will prove of great advantage to our educational interests in that Stake.  Davis Stake Academy.  Wednesday, March 23rd, being unexpectedly at my dis- posal, the Box Elder Stake Academy, having closed its session, I h a filled out the day by going to Farming- 
 3. to address a public meeting by appointment in the L.D.S. Meetinghouse, the congregation being about one half outriders, the building was crowded.  The next morning at 3 o'clock I left by Oregan Short Line Ry. for [Minnidoke], where I was taken by Bro. Prim to Albion, Cassin Co. to hold a meeting there in the evening in the Wardmeetinghouse.  Pres. Haight having joined me at Albion, we left for Oakley in the morning of Tuesday, May 2nd, where I had also to address a public meeting in the evening. Cassin Stake Academy Wednesday, May 3rd, was devoted to visiting the Stake Academy in the forenoon.  The Principal, Bro. A. F. O. Nielson, is a young man of much promise, and has done very faithful labors for three years in that Academy. He will take charge the coming school year of the Tooele Stake Academy at Grantsville.  The Stake Superintendent of Education of Idaho, has procured for Bro. Nielson, although entirely unsolicited, a [Lifedipls] of the First Grade, to teach in any educational institution in the Stake of Idaho, "in appreciation of his ability and efficient labors as an educator."  On this account I am somewhat arry that Bro. Nielsonleaves that state, as his remaining there would have given considerable prestige 
 Some of the specimens of maps drawn by several students were yet on exhibition around the walls and were the best ever produced of the Land in any of our churchschools. Bro. Joseph G. Nelson, Principal, assisted Miss Mattie Nelson, Pres. Dept. & Ladies Week, and by Bro. John S. Bingham, Pres. Dept. Bro. Nelson has served his second year as Principal and expects to  settle permanently at Preston, finishing his Normal Course as the B.Y. College in Logan next year, but retaining his Principalships at Preston with Bro. Bingham as Deputy. This special arrangement was proposed by me and accepted by the Oneida S. Board, in conformity with a similar arrangement for next year at the Sanpete S. Academy The records of the Oneida S. Academy are in perfect order.  Malad Stake Academy. Tuesday, April 26, I arrived at West Portage as per appointment and was hospitably received by Pres. Hoskins, with whom I attended the following day a meeting of the Stake Board of Malad and in the evening a public meeting  Samaria in the educational interest. The former Sem- inary at Samaria has been discontinued for the present academic year and its Principal, joined the Stake Academy at Malad as Assistant Teacher, by mutual 
 Diaz stopping at Dublan a few hours to address a  meeting of the Saints there, who unanimously en- dorsed the motion recommendation of the Central  Board to have their school recognized as a churchschool Seminary, with Bro. Anson  Call as Principal. The latter will also apply for  a License under the usual registrations, as also  Bro. Harris, his Assistants, and the lady-teachers at Diaz. We arrived at Diaz, Saturday, Nov. 12, about  3 P. M. just in time to attend the meeting of the Primary. There was also a very crowded meeting of the M.I.A. in the evening. The following Sunday, was occupied  with attending the usual three meetings, at which  the Saints fully endorsed the appointment of a  Local Board for the Academy, and of Bp. W. D. Johnson of Superintendent of the Religion Classes throughout the Mexican Mission. A meeting of the Local Board was held bet- ween the afternoon and evening meetings. Monday, Nov. 14, we started on our return- trip to Deming where we arrived Wednesday,  Nov. 16, about 2 P. M. My most cordial thanks  are due to Apostle Teasdale, Bp. Johnson  and the Saints throughout the Mexican Mission, for the great hospitality shown me; and for the  deep interest they have manifested in our edu- cational movement. 
 ton with the early train for the purpose of visiting the Davis Stake Academy. I found Bro. Woodbury, the Principal, and Miss Woodruff, his Assistant, con- ducting an Intermediate and a Preparatory Depart- ment, comprising 38 students in all, a remnant of about 85, attend that attended during the winter. There is good work done by these two teachers, although Bro. Woodbury, according to his own statement, is lacking as yet somewhat in discipline. I have given him some pointers which, in connection with the instructions he will get in the coming Normal Summer School, may in able him in future to overcome this deficiency. My coming not having been previously known, was not at- tended by any Boardmeeting, but a public meeting in the evening, enabled me to address a large au- dience on the subject of our Church Schools and Religion-Classes.  Morgan Stake Academy.  Tuesday, March 24th, found out at Morgan City, where I spent the evening in conversation with Bro. Geo. J Ramsey, the Principal of the Stake Academy, in order to get posted in regard to the educational condition of that Stake. The attendance at the school has sunk down from 45 to 11, and the Principal reports that the apathy among the people and of some of the 
 nan 
 agreement between the Stake and the Local Board Tuesday, April the 26th, spent the whole day in attending the musical at the Stake Academy, conducted by the Principal alone. His school having diminished very much to a great extent, The Assistant Teacher has taken to his farming and saying his last term, leading the Principal alone to conduct all the class of the 3 4 & 5 Readergrades. Bro. Geo Cole is a faithful worker and is improving professionally in a very satisfactory manner. This school is on a solid foundation. The Board contemplates to enlarge the accommendations for the school by proposing a portion of their yet unfinished tabernacle next sum- mer. These improvements can be made at a cour- parstively small expence.  There is yet a very large amount of local jealousy between Portage and Ma- lad as to the permanent location of the Stake Acad- amy, which is greatly to the disadvantage of the instututions.  The sooner the General Board would give instructions to have this question definitely settled the better it would be for the educational interest of that Stake. Public meetings at Malad and Portage in the evenings of the Wednesday ^Tuesday^ and Thursday April 26 & 28, h in the interest of our churchschool movement, have not been, I trust, without some beneficial results.  Cassia Stake Academy. Arriving at Oakley, via Collinston, Pocatello, and Minersville in the afternoon of Saturday, April 30, where Pres. extended to me the hospitalities of his home during the time of 
 Maricopa Stake.  Monday, Nov. 21, I started for Maricopa, via Bowie Station and the Southern Pacific, arriving at Tempe, Wednesday, Nov. 24, where I was received by Pres. Chs. I. Robson, who took me to Mesa City. There was a meeting appointed the same morning, which was largly attended by the Saints and many outsiders. Thanksgiving Day brought on two more mee- tings, and the following Friday was spent in the new Academy. Bro. Robert H. Smith, for- merly of Diaz, is the Principal.  Although Bro. Smith was not familiar with our system, and I had some apprehension before meeting him, I must confess that he has surpassed by far my expectations, both spiritually and intellectually. I had to give him some pointers for his guidance in future, of course, but he is doing good work and carries a good influence with him. He is very humble, teachable, and devoted to his work. Saturday was a meeting of the Stake Board. The three meetings on Sunday kept on growing in attendance, that I was told that in the evening meeting there had been as large a congregation outside on the sidewalk and at the windows as there was inside. The Saints here as well as in the Mexican Mission and in Uintah seem to be spiritually hungry. 
 leading men is very discouraging, although I found during my visit that all are speaking in the highest terms of the labors of Bro. Ramsey. Bro. Ramsey is assisted part- ly by one of his lady-students as a tutor, and his own classwork, general management and influence is to be commented very highly. At the Board meeting in the afternoon ^of Friday, March 25,^ the general indifference of the people was made conspicuous by the report of the Treasurer, that even leading men were owing yet their tuition for the 1. 2. 3. & 4th year. I suggested to the Board the propriety of carrying on that part of their Academy work upon strict business principles in future, and that the Treasurer in his Annual Financial Statement to the General Board on July 15% should not only state the amount of unpaid tuition but also the number of parties among ^from^ whom that indebtedness was due, for it might perhaps occur to the General Board to ask for the names. That shot will sound secure the payment of the greater portion of the amount, as some leading men ^I dared say^ would sooner pay twice the amount then have their names brought before the General Board, in such a way. As it is very doubtful if the Stake Board will secure the Courthouse at

 my stay. The great Fastmeeting the next day was spent with  the rest of the Saints in a four hours' meeting under the in- fluence of the Spirit of God in a very marked degree, when I also found time to perform the duties of my mission. A very pleasant meeting of the Stake Board was held in the afternoon and evening, after which an adjournment was taken to attend a public meeting especially arranged for me. The subject of Religion-Classes formed the chief topic of my remarks. Monday, May 2nd was spent in the Academy. Here the Principal Bro. A. F. O. Nielson conducted the Primary Dept. inclusive of III & IV Readers alone; the larger students, constituting the Intermediate Grade, having had to quit for the 11 term on account of farm work. Outside of the B. Y. Academy and the B. Y. College I have seen no where among our churchschools such splendid primary work as there is being done by Bro. Nielson. Although the new Academy building is not quite finished, it is sufficiently so that both stories can be used by the Ac- ademy to advantage.

 Left Maricopa ^Mesa City^ Monday, Nov. 28, via Phoenix, where I had  the pleasure of an hour's conversation with Governor Zulick,  who appeared to be warm friend to our people. I arrived  at Oakland, Thursday, NovDec. 1st, at 10 P. M. being cordially  received by Bro. John L. Dalton, at 16th Str. Station. The next  day was spent in visiting Saints in Oakland and San  Francisco, and taking a drive to the Cliffhouse in - the midst of a trenching rain. Saturday more visits  and some writing. Sunday two meetings to small congregations with some strangers. Bro. Dalton is  much handicapped in his movements to hunt up some old members of the church in Las Angeles, Sacramento, and other places for want of funds. I started for home, Monday, Decr. 5, and arrived Tuesday night.  Summary.  During this circuit I attended 7 Boardmeetings, 29 Public Meetings, visited 8 churchschools, and organized  several educational Boards, being about from  Oct. 17 to Dec. 6, being 50 days in all.

 Morgan City for their Academy, ^next acad. year^, it is a matter of very serious concern what to do in case of such a dis- appointment, the more so, as Bro. Ramsey would be willing to make his stay permanent one, if the people should desire it so. Otherwise, Bro. Ramsey would be a valuable acquisition to anyone of our churchschools.  Summit Stake Academy.  Having been previously informed by Pres. W. W. Cluff, that the Summit Stake Academy had closed at the end of the third term with a "handsome attendance and a very creditable examination", I know that I should not have the privilege of visiting the school, but hoped to meet with the Board and with the Principal, and then got some idea of the condition of affairs and of the work done. On my arrival at Coalville, Saturday, March 26, at 6 P.M. I found that the Principal, Bro. Geo. Middleton, had left for his home in the South, and that there could be no Boardmeeting on account of the absence of most of the members. Bro. Middleton is going to withdraw from the educational field as he wants to go east in the fall to study Medicine. I am sorry for this unceremonious way of quitting a labor which that young man has performed to the benefit of his pupils and much credit to himself.

He desires to pur- sue his studies for qualifying himself in higher grades I shall be crowded for Principals next year, as several others have given notice to quit for the same reason, and the sufficient supply of qualified persons for such positions becomes excedingly doubtful.  Bannock Stake Academy.  Tuesday, May 3rd found me again on the road in order to reach Rexburg via Minedoka, Pocatello, and Market Lake, arriving at my destination Wednesday afternoon, May 4th. President Ricks having met me at Market Lake, and made me comfortable at his house at Rexburg. Thursday, May 5th I spent in visiting the Stake Academy, con- ducted by Bro. Chas N. Watkins, as Principal, and Sister  Barnes, Assistant. The school has registered for this II Term about 75 students, all the way from the [Chartclass] to the V Readergrade, although of the latter are only a few left, the rest had to quit on account of farming. Bro. Watkins has infused new life into the educa- tional affairs, and so ably assisted by Sister Barnes The great drawback for the further development of this Stake Academy is the schedule refusal of all  the Wards of at the southside of the river to support the Academy in any way either by sending students or with means. This feeling extends to the public meeting and to Quarterly Conferences. When holding meetings by appointment at Lewisville and Eagle Rock, which

 President W. W. Cluff posted me, however, as far as possible wit in regard to the condition of the school, laid before me all the Records of the Academy, to be kept according to Gen. Circ. No. 7, page 17, all of which I found in good order, and stated to me the difficulties with which their Academy had to wrestle from the beginning, having had to change its locality four times already since its organization. There is, however, a prospect of securing either one of two fine houses, well suited for schoolpurposes at comparatively low figures, if they could hope for some assistance in that direction. As in all the other Stakes visited during this fourth circuit, the Religion-classes in Summit Stake have been sadly neglected in some Wards, in consequence of which I arranged with Pres. Cluff to attend their Quarterly Conference. May 11, 12, & 13, on my return from Idaho, for the purpose of explaining to the Bishops that na- ture and mode of operation of this educational feature. Similar arrangements were made in Ogden and Brigham City. Sunday, March 27, I atten addressed a Sun- day School, a Public Meeting, in the afternoon, and a conjoined meeting of three M. I.

Smith, that I should apply to the respective Stake Presi- dents to send me the traveling expenses, if they desired ^me^ to fill my appointments within their Stakes, as there was no money in the treasury of the General Board of Edu- cation, I have done so and have recieved from all of them [al]ready answer in some instances with the ac- companying cash, all the way from Idaho into Ari- zona.  In conformity, therefore, with my appro[v]ed pro- gram I started on my circuit around the churchschools of southern Utah, Saturday, October 21st to Nephi. President Paxman, having to attend court at Provo that same day, had left all necessary instructions with the Stake Academy Principal, Justin Call, with whom I spent the afternoon in examining the records of the Academy and getting posted in regard to the educa- tional conditions of that Stake. By special invitation of Pres. Paxman I had the privilege of attending and addressing the beautiful Prayercircle, at Nephi, on Sunday morning, followed by a visit to the Sunday school 
 evening. Having experienced several chills during the day, Pres. Cluff strongly protested against my star- ting to Heber City, via Park the next morning, de- claring that the heavy storms then raging in the mountains could not be endured by me in the situation I was in, and so I had to cancel my appointment for Wasatch Stake Academy, telephoning to Pres. Abraham Hatch the situa- tion, and returned home, Monday, March  28th, endeavoring to head off any relapse in to Influence, so that I might be ready for Conference.

 places at the southside of the river, I took occasion to talk privately with the respective Bishops on the subject, and was surprised at the intensity of the feeling existing in that portion of the Stake. The Bishops declare that it is the unanamimous feeling of the Saints on the south side of the river, that they are suffering for want of spiritual nourish- ment on account of the geographical location of their section of the Stake, and that there be no hope for them until they get organized into a Stake for themselves. Although this feature does not belong to my department for discusion, I have to refer to it as it greatly impedes the progress of the educational work.  The predecesosr of Bro. Watkins having not been very exact in keeping the records re- quired in our schools, Bro. Watkins has great difficulty in straightening up his books, but hopes to have them all in order before opening of the next schoolseason.  [7;] The reason of above alluded to a quorum of the Stake Board could not be obtained and some informal conversation bet- ween the five members present and myself have in the edu- cational interest had to take its place. Several meetings with the teachers during Friday and Saturday resulted in arriving at a mutual understanding in regard to

 This is by far the best organized and conducted Sundayschool which it has been my privilege ever to visit. At the mee- ting of all the Instructors after the close of the school, I explained, by request of Pres. Paxman, the harmony of aim and methods existing between ^the^ Sundayschool Work and the Religion Class Movement, on the basis of the Circularletter on the subject, dated Sept. 12. A discourse in the afternoon meeting, and a lecture to the conjoined M. I. Association in the evening concluded my labors for that day.  Juab Stake Academy  According to the suggestion of Pres. Geo. Q. Cannon, to have our churchschools conducted on the pro rata plan during the present academic year, Bro. Justin D. Call, and his assistant, Miss Mattie Nelson, have assumed all the financial responsibilities of the school, except the fuel, and have met also in this regard with unforeseen success.  The Academy is paying its way very satisfactorily, the attendance being large and constantly increasing.  In the Primary Depart- ment, comprising pupils from the First to the Fourth Grade, inclusive, all seats were taken. This Academy is rapidly passing to the front among our churchschools, and the prospect  is, that the Stake Board will be under the neccessity of enlarging the premises, with the disappearance of the financial stringency just now prevailing everywhere.

The Seminary here has been in charge of Bro. Martin Winters and his sister Mary, both of whom are faithful young people, but notyet being graduates, their efficiancy is rather limited in some  respects. It was the best, however, that could be done under the circumstances.  They had to run the Seminary of their now financial risk, but filled the house with about 75 pupils this winter. Bp: Rick and his Associates have succeeded finally to obtain full possession of the grounds and building and contemplatingd to conduct the school the coming academic year in proper shape. We had very pleasant meeting of the Local Board the Seminary. The Seminary had closed, and I found some of the Records in satisfactory condition, and far to balance missing instructed Bos.

 At the meeting of the Stake Board after schoolhours, the establishment of Religion-Classes on the basis of the Cir- cularletter, was decided upon, and Bro. J. D.

The Recordbook of this Stake Board of Education shows are very punctual attendance of all the members, regular meetings, and comprehension of the importance of their mission.

 Provo, October 5, [189]3  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In consequence of the great diversity in the nomenclature of Grades, Departments, and Classes, in many of our church- schools, a great confusion in this respect had arisen, ma- king an estimate of their comparative standing and labors on my part and a subsequent correct report to the General Board almost impossible. To obviate this difficulty for the future, Church School Papers, No. 20, Juv. Instr. April 15, last, recommended this subject with several others to the consideration of all churchschool teachers, pre- paratory to discussion at our Annual Convention.  The Annual Convention met at the Brigham Young Academy, Provo, August 14, at 11 A.M. The proceedings of that Convention are reported in the Church School Papers, No. 23, Juv. Instr. Sept. 1st. After much discussion of the above stated point, it was decided to refer it to the Board of Examiners for the formulation of a mode of nomen- clature, to be complied with by all our churchschools, as soon that mode of nomenclature should have obtained the sanction of the General Board of Education.

Pat- tended the exercises of the Academy dring the whole of Friday ^Monday^, and found that the Preparatory Dept consisted only of 8 students left, and the Primary of 45. Bro. Miles is an earnest worker, his only fault is a lack of gentleness in his dealings with the pupils. Being exceedingly sensitive himself it is strange how he can be so inconsiderate sometimes with the feelings of others. Saturday, May 14th, a meeting of the Stake Board was held at which the numbers manifested unanimously the determination to develop the interests of the Academy and Religion-Classes throughout the Stake. It is impossible to speak in too high terms of the wisdom and personal sacrifice shown by President Wm. Budge in behalf of that Stake Academy, for it became plainly appearent to me that without him that Academy could not have

This subject I have followed up on many other occasions since then.  Passing through Parowan the following day, I arrived at Cedar in the evening, attended Sunday School in the morning of the Sunday, afternoon and eveningmee- tings.  The necessity of a Normaltraining for Sunday School workers was very apparent in Cedar City. An extenuating circumstances in regard to the back- ward condition of their Sunday schools is the pe- culiar occupation of the majority of the people in that region of country viz: The dairy business is ta- king young and old during a great portion of the year into the mountains, thus braking up day-, church-, and Sundayschools; the young people returning late in the fall educationally demoralised, and requiring much time to get them back again into the spirit for studying any- thing.  The Parowan Stake Academy at Cedar City, is conducted by Bro. Holstein Warner, a Graduate of the Brigham Young Academy, and his assistant Miss Sarah Ann Higbee, volunteer teachers on the pro rata plan.

I attended Sunday School a Quorum Meeting, and a ^two^ Public Meetings, at all of which oc- casion I had to bear my testimony to the inspired me nature of an educational work. Tuesday, May 17, I left for  Randolph, where I arrived in the evening, and followed an appointment made for me that same evening to address the people in behalf of  The Rich County Academy.  This institution in reality working but a Seminary, and was per- mitted by the General Board with the consent of the Bear Lake Stake Board to assume the title of "Rich County Academy in view of its isolated geographical position, similar to that at Elba, Cassia Stake, where now an  Academy or churchschools building is in progress of erection. The Randolph Churchschool has thus far been permitted to occupy the upperom of the Court- house, but doubts are entertained by the Local Board in regard to the occupancy the coming school- year, which makes the erection of are own school- building a necessity sooner or later.  Bro. Olaf Larsen, the Principal informed me that the school had closed the previous Friday, and that he himself desired to resign. Wednesday a Boardmeeting was held in the afternoon at Woodruff, at which all the members indicated their appreciation of Bro. Larsen's labors with 
 records and the spiritual, intellectual, and dis- ciplinary condition.  The Board hopes, that Bro. Warner may make his permanent home in Cedar.  The atten- dance in the Intermediate Department was quite low as yet but a large increase was expected at the begin- ning of the next term. Pres. U. T. Jones has thus far carried a great part of the financial responsibilities of the Board on his own shoulders, a circumstance which I have not failed to remind the people of in my public addresses there. At the meeting of the Stake Board after schoolhours. I learned that a Bro. Williams of Kannab, had been appointed Stake Superintendent of Religion-Classes.  I have since communicated with the new appointee in regard to his duties.

 the hope that he would not resign. Bro. Larsen has taken his decision under advisement at present. A very crowded mee- ting at Woodruff that night testified to the deep interest which the people of that part of the Stake are taking in educational matters. I found the Records of theRandolph School in a  satisfactory condition. Thursday, May 19th at  o'clock in the morning I started for Provo via Evanston, Ogden, and Salt Lake, in order to be present at the closing exercises of  The Brigham Young Academy Friday, May 20, just 44 years ago the same day that I did graduate. Since my resignation as Principal of that instu- tion I have deemed it my duty to watch the drift of wants there  as closely as time and circumstances would permit. Acknow- ledging to its fullest extent the rapid intellectual progress that institution is making since its occupation of its [smudge] and well adapted buildings, I look, nevertheless, with serious apprehension upon the financial condition of the Academy and the gravity of the situation may compel the new Principal to curtail to some extent the farreaching shemes which he has in contemplation.  Some general observations made during this and the previous Circuits of the present schoolyear will best brought forth 
 appreciation to make mention here of that brother's manner in working out in part his salvation. We left Cedar for Leeds, Tuesday, Oct. 31, and arrived at the latter place toward evening.  A meeting had been appointed for me here, and was listened to by a very attentive audience, although it appears from several observations that neither Sunday school nor M. I. Associations are in an exemplary condition, and the spiritual energy of the people in that place is in a low condition. There were three lamps illuminating the poor apology for a schoolhouse during that meeting.  These lamps were brough't by some people from their homes when they came to meeting.  Wednesday, November 1st  in the afternoon we arrived at St. George. After having attended and addressed the Fastmeeting the next morning, I paid my respects to President David Cannon and to the rest of his colaborers in the Temple, and attended by special invitation a meeting of the district- school- teachers of St. George in the evening.  All of them are interested in the Sundayschools and M. I. Associations, and promised me to take an active part also in the Religion - Classes.

 Provo City, March 7th [189]3  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother, Herewith I submit respectfully the report of my labors in the Second Circuit, the program of which had been previously ap- proved of by you.  The Brigham Young Academy, Provo.  After having officially notified the Board of Trustees of this institution of my intended visit to the Academy, I spent two days, Jan. 10 & 11, in attending the various exercises of the institution, and met with the Faculty at the regular meeting, Wednesday, Jan. 11, at 7 P.M. This Academy surpasses all other churchschools not only in the number of its students (over 900 registered up to date) and of its regular teachers (23), but also in the complexity of its organiza- tion and in the amount of labor performed there, in consequence of all of which the influence of that Academy is recognized throughout all the Stakes of Zion. Besides the regular de- partments graded according to Gen. Circ. No. 7, pp. 19 to 21, there are following special organizations: 1. A Kindergarten Class with about 30 little ones under 6 years of age, with a Normal training Class for young ladies to prepare themselves for that particular feature of education. 2. A polytechnic Class for training in practical workmanship. There are over 40 
 schoolhours, as the children are then too tired to take  much interest, and especially many boys have to go home to do chores; neither could all the good be ac- complished on Saturdays for the same reasons as re- gards to the boys and many of the larger girls. It was therefore, decided to apply to the School Trustee s to close the district schools one hour at least sooner  one day or two in the afternoon, for the purpose of letting our children have the privilege of going to their Religion-Classes.  This plan has met with much favor everywhere, that it has been adopted thus far since, in St. George, Parowan, Beaver, Sevier, and Sanpete Stakes. The Stake Academy at St. George has had to suspend operation for this academic year, and Bro. Nephi Savage, the former Principal, has ad- opted a position as teacher in the Districtschools, but has been appointed as Stake Superintendent of Religion- Classes. The same evening I filled an appointment in a meeting at Santa Clara. Saturday, Nov. 4, ad- dressed a conjoined meeting of the M. I.

 students waiting to take part, as only about a dozen only are at work just now, on account of lack of facilities. 3. A class for military and physical drill, constituting a complete military organization, fully uniformed and furnished from Camp Douglas with a complete stand of arms. 4. a class in Physical Culture for young ladies with Normal training in that branch of study. 5. A cClasses in Ladies' Work, Plain Sewing, Fancy, and in all other branches in tht line, fully graded. 6. A class in the Fine Arts, with Painting and Modeling. 7. A Music Department, consisting of three grades in Instrumental Music, and in a "Choral Society" for Vocal Music. 8. The Commercial College, with three teachers, just over 50 students. 9.The Normal Department with a four years' course, counting nearly 250 Normal students. 10. The M. I. Association Normal Course. 11. The Sunday School Teachers' Normal Course. In the face of the immense amount of work which this Insti- tution is performing for the benefit of the youth of Zion, it is greatly to be lamented that the Board of Trustees of the Brigham Young Academy finds itself drifting irresistibly towards financial break- ers, that threaten a catastrophe too serious in its results as that such a possibility could be contempleted with equanimity by any lover of our Youth. 
 at noon; and a public meeting in the Tabernacle in the afternoon, after which we took our de- parture from St. George, having been appointed for on evening meeting at Washington. That mee- ting there was crowded, and Karl Gottfried Maeser|I noticed with much satisfaction the presence and close attention of the younger portion of that community. Monday, Nov. 6 addressed a large meeting in the evening at Toquer- ville. As there are several young people from this and other places in St. George Stake attending the Normal Course for Sunday School, and M. I. Asso- ciation Work at the Brigham Young Academy, at  Provo, a vast improvement in these institutions throughout the Stake is looked forward to after the return of these Normals. I am sorry to state however, that one of them, Bro. Jedediah Larson of St. George, died at Provo last week, of pneumonia. Tuesday, Nov. 7, we arrived in the afternoon at Kannarah, and I addressed as per appointment a large meeting there in the evening.  It would be ridiculous, if it were not too sad, to notice the restraint ^under^ which the young men felt themselves obliged to ^be^ in that place, to behave themselves at least sufficiently during the meeting, in order not to become absolutely offensive.  "You see, Bro. [Maeser]," so said the Bishop to me, "Stockraising is [capacitated to] never to be seen in decent society." 
 Upon the representation of the undersigned, the Stake Presidency of Utah Stake with the consent of the High Coun- sil have organized and appointed a "Stake Board of Educa- tion", to whom henceforth the "Board of Trustees of the B.Y.A." will be held accountable.  This new Board sustained the ac- tionof the last Stake Conference, to suspend for the pres- ent academic year the operation of the "Religion Classes" in this Stake, in order to give the Sunday School Normal Clasa a fair share to demonstrate its thoroughgoing influence for good.  By appointment of Pres. Smoot I filled an appoint- ment in connection with Bp. Booth at Springville, while the Principal and teachers of the Academy filled similar appointments in the other Wards of this Stake, in order to educate the people ^up^ to an appreciation of our educational aims.  Sanpete Stake In compliance with appointments made for me by Pres. Canute Petersen for the time I had placed myself at his disposal, I started for Mt. Pleasant, Tuesday, January 17  to address a public meeting in the educational interest that same evening, and to visit the Seminary the next day, and met with the Local Board.  Bro. Geo. Christensen, the 
 Wednesday, Nov. 8, we returned to Parowan, where the same evening a meeting of the Seminary Board was held, at which the devotion of the members under the wise leadership of Bp. Charles Adams, manifested itself very markedly. The Seminary had opened five weeks before under the Principalship of Bro. Frank Cutler, who has accepted the position under the conditions of the usual pro rata plan, and has gained already within that short time the confidence of the community and of his pupils, so that the attendance at his Seminary is daily increas- ing.  His records are in first class order, and his plans, programs, methods, and general progress of his work very satisfactory, so that he expects to have an assistant before long.  His Sstudents comprise the 6, 7, & 8th grades. Much credit is due to the Seminary Board for fitting up and furnishing the Seminaryrooms in such a handsome and suitable manner.  A reception to address me by the Authorities and People of Parowan in the evening, I completed only in my capacity as a representative of the General Board of Education in whose names I thanked and congratulated them for their appreciation of the aims of that honorable body, and expressing the hope, that 
 Principal, is one of the ^our^ most conscientious and efficient Intermediate teachers, and as such I recommend him to the consideration of the General Board. This Seminary is held in one of the former Ward School Houses, but con- tains only one room, in consequences the students are very much crowded, and soon the engagement of an Assistant Teacher, although much needed, becomes inexpedient. The wise and energetic course of Bp. Lund, the chairman of the Local Board, has made the revival of this Seminary a possibility.  It is questionable, however, if the Seminary will be able to run the   full 40 weeks this year; but the Local Board are determined to make all possible efforts for a full academic year the next time. They could have nearly 200 students willing to attend, if they could ac- commodate them.  Sanpete Stake Academy, Ephraim.

Manti Seminary: Friday, January 20, I attended the L.D.S. Seminary, at Manti, Bro. Andrew C. Nelson, Principal, and Miss Flora Bean, Assistant. This Seminary occupies its own building, tolerably commodious as far the Intermediate Dept. is concerned, but the Preparatory Dept. is located upstairs, with an outside entrance and a drafty, riggety, and inconvenient staircase leading up to it, forcing teachers and students to go to and fro in all kinds of weather, besides losing a great deal of time, while with a little change in the architecture and comparatively small expense, all these evils could be obviated. The Principal is doing a fine work. I had designed him for the Principalship of the Stake Academy, at Ephraim, which should have been his proper place, but he concluded to remain at Manti in response to the solicitations and promises

The necessity of a Normaltraining for Sunday School workers was very apparent in Cedar City. An extenuating circumstances in regard to the back- ward conditions of their Sunday Schools is the pe- culiar occupation of the majority of the people in that region of country viz: The dairy business is ta- king young and old during a great partion of the year into the mountains, this braking up day [schools], church [schools], and Sunday schools; the young people returning late in the fall educationally demoralised and requiring much time to get them back again into the spirit for studying any thing.  The Parowan Stake Academy. at Cedar City, is conducted by Bro. Holstein Warner a Graduate of the Brigham Young Academy, and his assistant Miss Sarah Ann Higbee, volunteer teachers on the pro rata plan.  I am happy to report the Academy in excellent condition both in regard to the required 
 of the Local Board. It appears, however, that this Board is not able to meet the just expectations, financially, of Bro. Nelson, who therefore, in justice to his increasing family, will have to seek for a better position the next schoolyear. As his case is not the only one among our churchschool teachers, but the number of similar cases is bound to increase with every year, thus placing us in the deplorable condition to give young teachers an opportunity to obtain practical experience in our churchschools for a few years, or as long as they are willing or able to look upon their engagement as a mission, but then have to go into the District School Service for better pay, and we start again with fresh beginners, supplying the District Schools with efficient teachers, and keeping in the rear with inexperienced faces. I again recommend this matter to the earnest consideration of the General Board. Saturday, January 21, I returned to Ephraim, in order to attend a meeting of the Stake Board of Education, at 10 A.M; a meeting of the Religion Class Instructors of the Stake, at 2 P.M; and a meeting of the Church- school Teachers Convention of the Stake, at 7 P.M. It gives me great pleasure to report that meeting of the Religion Class instructors, the only one which I have 
 records and the spiritual, intellectual, and dis- ciplinary condition. The Board hopes that Bro. Warner may make his permanent home in Cedar. The atten- dance in the Intermediate Department was quite low as yet but a large increase was expected at the begin- ning of the most term. Pres. U. T. Jones has thus far carried a great part of the financial responsibilities of the Board on his own shoulders, a circumstance which I have not failed to remind the people of in my public addresses there. At the meeting of the Stake Board after school hours I learned that a Bro. Williams of Kannab, had been appointed Stake Superintendent of Religion-Classes. I have since communicated with the now appointee in regard to his duties.  A social meeting of the members of the Board, parents, and students, in the evening gave me an opportunity of explaining the necessity of domestic cooperation in our educational system.  St. George Stake.  A Bro. John E. Miller, of Parowan, did volunteer for the third time to take me all the way round between Parowan and St. George.  I deem it a duty of grateful 
 had the privilege of attending thus far. As Sanpete Stake of Zion has taken the lead in this great movement and is maintaining its prestige in this respect as well as in the number of its churchschools, I cannot speak in too warm terms of the influence for good observable among the young people of that Stake. The Normal Class in the Stake Academy is attended by about a dozen students, who are recognized at the Church Normal Training School, at Provo, as "Junior Normals" as "Normals of the First Year."  From that Normal Class quite a number of teachers have been prepared for the district schools, and are giving general satisfaction. Sunday, Jan.22nd I addressed the Sunday School in the forenoon. Public Meeting in the afternoon, and a conjoined meeting of the M.I. Association in the evening. Gunnison Seminary:-  Monday, Jan. 23 I started for Gunnison, to attend a meeting of the Local Board at 5 P.M. and a public meeting at 7 P.M. in the interest of their Seminary. The following day was spent in the most part at the Seminary, which is held in the nicely fitted up upper room of the Relief Society building. Bro. John T. Miller, Principal, without any Assistant.  Unfortunately, the exercises were much interfered with by many visitors crowding in notwith- 
 appreciation to make mention here of that brother's manner in working out in part his salvation. We  left Cedar for Leeds Tuesday, Oct. 31, and  arrived at the latter place toward evening. A meeting had been appointed for me here, and was listened to by a very attentive audience, although it appears from several observations that neither Sunday school nor M. I. Associations are in an examplary condition, and the spiritual energy of the people in that place is in a low condition. There were three lamps illuminating the poor apology for a schoolhouse during that meeting. These lamps were brought by some people from their homes when they came to meeting. Wednesday, November 1st in the afternoon we arrived at St. George. After having attended and addressed the Fastmeeting the next morning, I paid my respects to President David Cannon and to the rest of his colaborers in the Temple, and attended by special invitation a meeting of the district-school-teachers of St. George in the evening. All of them are interested in the Sunday schools and M. I. Associations, and promised me to take an active part also in the Religion-Classes. In meeting with the St. George Stake Board of Education the following day, the fact was made apparent, that it was not advantageous to hold the Religion-Classes after
