February 7, 1853 ~ Monday   7th I walked to Snows herd ground and back distance of the day 20.    ENDENTRY February 8, 1853 ~ Tuesday to  ENDENTRY February 9, 1853 ~ Wednesday   8, 9. I spent the day at home writing    ENDENTRY February 10, 1853 ~ Thursday   10th I spent this day at home writing    ENDENTRY February 11, 1853 ~ Friday   Feb 11th FIGURES This was a painful day I was called at about 1 oclok this morning to administer to sister Rhodes who had  been labouring in Child birth for two days she was nearly worn out  as she could not be deliverd. Brother Franklin Richards with myself administerd to her but she died at 2 oclock amid the greatest Agiony I closed her eyes. At 3 oclock PM. there was a Post Mortom examination made the Presidency and several of the Twelve were present the surgical operation was performed by Dr Andrews and no blame was attached to the mid  wives who officiated {the following is the result of the examination the child lay across the womb with own hand  oblong the head lay on the right side the feet on the left the child had torn the womb to pieces  with his feet and the afterbirth so if the child had been born the woman  could not live the doctor gave the following instructing to the women if the child presents feet  first put a hand into the womb and bring out the child feet first and if the child's face is turned  so the chin would hook under the illegible bone turn the child with the face  towards the back bone then it can be born if the child's feet come doubled up put up the hand  and bring down one limb at a time in the womb and turn the child he said the woman's  feelings should not be consulted at such times but the midwife should use their own illegible}    ENDENTRY February 12, 1853 ~ Saturday   12th FIGURE I attended sister Rhodes Funeral The President Twelve  and a large congregation of people assembled and President Young  preached and said that the few remarks I have to make I will endeavor to speak to the point my text is it is better to go to the house of mour- ning than to the House of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to heart. When we are in a situation so that we cannot  know any thing ownly what we know by the natural senses it causes us to mourn the loss of friends but if we could understand all  things it would often times be a source of Joy instead of morning when a spirit enters a tabernacle here in this life it enters  into a state of sorrow yet if we understood things in their  tru light we should be satisfyed with it. When the spirit enters the body it enters a dark sell and is left to sorrow and to be tried in all things but when the spirit leaves the body if  a saint it enters into the brilliant light and glory of God like taking a prisioner out of a dark sell whare he could see a little glimmer of light through the grates and put him into the blaze of the mid days sun. when we loose our Friends we mourn but what is it that mourns is it that light, truth and intelligence of the Almighty that is in man that mourns No it is the grocer part of our being that mourns let a person be unclothed and we could see the spirit of our sister and all other friends and shake hands with them and spirit be tangible to each other as our bodies now are to each other when I am filled with the spirit of God  I can see men and what is in them and the more we are in refined in spirit the more we can see the reason I cannot shake  hands with Sister Rhodes is becaus of this gross body. Women were not made to die in child bed as Sister Rhodes has done but what is the matter death is here it is death that has caused it death is in the land around us it is here Children die before they are born this because their is death around us we cannot   ENDENTRY se it we have the Head ake we cannot se that (yet it exist) because we are in the body but if we were out of the body we could se it we should advance in the phylosophy of Eternal things and learn as we live when we go to the House of feasting we go to feast our bodies when we go to the house of mourning we mourn as it were in spirit and our minds  are called to serious truths but what would really be a case of mourning it would be to follow a person to the grave who had not improved their day of salvation had an oppertunity of being saved and exhalted and had neglected it that would be a case of mourning but a person that had done the best they could and improved their oppor- tunities of salvation we have no cause to mourn for such I would  say to the children dont mourn for your mother I would to God you was as sure of salvation as your mother is If I was to mourn for any thing in this case it would be because we have not more power to  cast the devil out of the house and out of the Neighborhood. Can we realize that sister Rhodes is not dead she lives now more than she did before it is the sinner that will die not the Righteous when the spirit of this woman left the body it was ushered into a flood of light but her body is as any other clay but her spirit is in open day she saw a little light in the body so as not to put her eye out when she came to the full light   I wish to give a little counsel to the children here Brother Snow will take charge of the place I want the children to go to school and  want an inventory of things here taken for the benefit of  Brother Rhodes and brother Snow both I request the children to do as well as your mother has done according to the light you have and I will warrant you salvation and Eternal life and I would say  the same to all who are here but upon no other principle can I warrant anybody salvation exsept upon the principle of doing good and obeying the Lord do good to your families and to each other. I want to say to all present there is no blame to be attached to any of the sisters who waited upon Sister Rhodes they have all done as well as they could for I have enquired into  the whole affair and her time had come to die and so will yours in its turn.    ENDENTRY February 13, 1853 ~ Sunday   13th Sunday Meeting was addressed in the morning By Brother Joseph  Young He spoke of the blessings of the people it was not wealth and  riches that made men happy but it was by having the truth and obey- ing if this people are called a happy people well they are in a great measure yet many of the saints have disappointment in their path yet we should trust all our affairs in the hands of god we should do right and follow the counsel of those that are set over us and carry out their views and the blessing of God will attend us and we shall be happy   J. M. Grant followed and said he hoped all would attend to their prayers it takes as much to damn a man as it does to save him some wonder why we dont have revelation now in our day as well as in the days of Joseph. in his day the bretn would not build a log cabin till they went to Joseph to ask counsel how they should set it whare they should put the door andc but at  the present day men have learned to do sumthing themselves without troubling the president or the Lord about it some have thought if they could get to valley they would be Holy and amdng and among a Holy people but I do not know of any soil that will make men   ENDENTRY Holy if men are not Holy themselves I dont know of any particular  spot of ground that will make them so. Joseph had to give written  Revelation to get men to go on missions but I do not believe that any  men were ever called more by Revelation or as much as any  that were ever called to go on a mission to preach the gospel than  were our Brethren last fall nor do I believe any men wer filled  more with Revelation and inspiration in blessing those set apart then  were our Brethren who blessed those set apart last fall their is no  other kingdom like this on the Earth the Ancient Apostles had no more  of the spirit of God to prepare them for their work then our Apostles  have for the work which they have to perform in our day I would  say that the dispensation of Moses and Christ and the Apostles looks like this dis- pensation though this dispensation will eclips all other dispensations  for it is the finishing up of the building Moses never began to do what  we have to do. I am of the opinion that men that are our prophets  Apostles and leaders that have laid the foundation of this Church and kingdom  and are building upon it were reserved forom Eternity to come forth  in this dispensation to accomplish the great work which is to be  done never did men live with more nerve desission of character  perseverance faith and power than those that lead this dispensation Had they have lived in the days of the Apostles they would have raised  the devil with both Jew and Gentile. Had they have lived in the days of  Moses they would have raised the vary Devil with the Canaanites  and various Nations. the commencement of this Church and Kingdom  may not appear as great as it did in the days of Moses and Christ and the  Apostles but look at the progress of this kingdom. and the deeds and work  of Our leaders and the people are startling. even their exidous out of  the states to these mountains and the results that have and will follow  are greater than the results that followed Moses and the Israelites a mighty great Nation have sent their Judges and rulers to us They  did not behave themselvs as they should do we cast them out and  sent them home if all the world was consolodated into one Nation  and sent delegates and rulers unto us if they run against the priest- hood and infringed upon our rights we would cast them out and  send them home regardless of consequences we know what the  consequences are.   I want to say to the mass of the saints here  you do not keep up with the Presidency of this Church and those  that are associated with him and if you are not careful I fear  they will get out of sight of you and perhaps be translated and leve  you I pray God to keep you in the path of duty so that you may  inherit all the blessings that are promised you   President Young Kimball followed and said he believed we had more to do than  other dispensations yet they had the Keys of the kingdom if they  had not had them they could not have given them to us Jesus says my  sheep hear my voice and will follow me if they dont pray I  think they are not the sheep of Christ if you dont ask the savio saviour for what you want how do you expect to get it then ask  the Lord for what you want Brother Brigham holds the Keys of  this Kingdom and no body els holds them as he does others hold  keys but they hold them under him He holds the keys that Peter  held. some want to go to Calafornia whare it is warmer but  going to Calafornia wont warm your hearts the majority of  this people have great hearts and you want to be able to stand alone  without leaning upon any one if you dont do it you will be apt to fall if I ever get to glory I expect to be tried some think they   ENDENTRY been tryed by leaving their homes but how is it you was on other  mens lands and servants and now you have houses and lands of your own so this was no great trial but a blessing but you have to be tried. we  are going to build up a Temple I expect the devil will kick up a fuss  by and by to try you well Let it come I hope the chaff will be blown away but when Brother Brigham says build this Temple let us go to  it rit up. Some have asked if we could do any more good in the  States I say yes when those that profess to be saints will gather  out and not much before   B Young followed and said if the people will be on the Temple ground  to morrow at 11 oclok we will break the ground for the commencement  of the foundation of the Temple. I do not believe that Enoch and his  people eincreased in wrighteousnes faith and obedience and improved any  faster than this people have since the commencement of this Kingdom  I said this in the days of Joseph I have no doubt but God expects  us to improve more than any other people that ever lived on the  Earth then let us double our dilligence and let the parents both men  and women never scease untill they govern themselves in all things  and if we are tempted to do wrong never scease untill we conquor  that spirit and bring it in subjection under your feet that you may ere  long become rulers Kings and Priest unto God    ENDENTRY February 14, 1853 ~ Monday   FIGURE Feb 14th 1853 This was an important and interesting day to the saints in the valley and even in all the world the saints  met upon the Temple block in a vast body to break the ground  for another Temple the people commenced gathering at an  early hour and at 11 oclok there were thousands upon the  ground President Young and Counsel The quorum of the Twelve  with many of the quorums of the Church were on the ground. All the bands  of music in the City were present. at 11 oclok President Brigham Young  Willard Richards got into a buggy inside  the square surrounded by the quorum of the Twelve President Young  arose and addressed the people and said our history is to well  known for me to speak of it now. We shall now again attempt  to build another Temple we have tried it many times bet have  not been able to finished them so as to occupy them for any length  of time we may not now but we will triy it we may Just as  well build a Temple that will cost a Million of dollars as well  as not and we would be just as well off and better to than before  And I would just as well build a Temple that would cost  a million of Dollars if I knew we should be driven from it in a month by our enemies as though we should occupy  it a Thousand years it is all the same with me for when the  Lords Commands us to do any thing we should do it just  as freely without asking the whys and wharefore whether we have  the privilege of enjoying it or not. If you ask if it is the will of  God for us to build a Temple I answer yes it is the will of God  we should build a Temple we cannot attend to the ordinances of  the House of the Lord without it. If you ask if I have received a  revelation or vision upon the subject I would answer yes I  have been in vision much of the time upon the subject I knew it  was the will of God that we should build a Temple on thise same  ground when I first came into the valley and while the brethren  were exploring out I said all the time this is the place for the City and Temple   ENDENTRY it is the will of God that we should do all we can in this valley  and surrounding country for the benefit of the people if the people needed  it I would give them a written Revelation upon this subject  but do you not know that it is your duty to build up Houses for your  own benefit you want a buttery bedrooms and other convenient  rooms in your dwelling house well we want a Temple more  than we want dwelling houses. I will relate some of the sayings  of Kirtland He said conserning the building of that  Temple that it grieved him and also the spirit of God to think that  the saints were not willing to build a Temple by the counsel of the  priesthood without a written revelation and commandment from  God that was it not for the penurious feelings of the people the Lord would  not give revelations and commandments as he does whenever the  Lord finds the people willing to do good build up his Kingdom and do good  without being commanded He will be more pleased with them   I will bring forth my art and plan for a Temple then if any  man can present any better plan or get faith enough to  call to his aid any of the old Nephites or any of the Ancients  and will present a better plan than mine will be we will  receive it.   A word to the people I wish to ask if you want  a commandment evry year to require you to pay your  Tithing when it is a standing law unto Israel and has been  from the days of Abraham you all know this well if you  dont want to pay your tithing or any portion of you I dont  want you should it is for your good not mine I dont  want a Temple to get my endowments in For I got my  Endowments and all the blessings appertaining thereto under  the hands of Joseph before his death and before the Temple was  built in Nauvoo and so did so my counsellors and a part of the  Tweleve get theirs before the Temple was built. Brother Joseph  seemed urged by the spirit of God to perform this work had he not have done it he might have died without conferring  the Keys upon others. if this people pay their tithing we  shall have an abundance in the store house to build a  Temple with without giving all you have got yet all  you have should be upon the Alter ready to be offered if  necessary I shall ask the people to come and work out  their Tithing by labour for that is what we want I  believe we shall have your help.   7 years ago tomorrow  at 7 oclok I crossed the Missippi River I believed then  that God had a good place in the mountains for us and  would lead us to it and He has done it for which I feel  thankfurl. if some feel quite sorry for not having the  privilege of suffering with us but I will promise you all  if you will be faithful that you shall have the privilege of  suffering and being tried as much as you will wish let all  men be satisfied faithful and Humble and God will bless you   Heber C Kimball then arose and with uplifted hands to heaven  offered up a fervent Heart felt prayer to God imploreing his  blessing upon President Young and Councellors and all the Authorites  of the Church with the whole house of Israel He then dedicated  the ground unto God and prayed for the blessings of the Lord to  attend them in building the Temple and all the public works in  Zion   ENDENTRY At the close of the prayer the presidency and Twelve walked to the South East cornor of the ground laid out for the Temple the ground being frozen President Heber C Kimball commenced  breaking the ground with a pick then President Richards then A. Lyman  F. D. Richards then the ground was broke and President Young took out the first turf while taking it out silver Dollar was flung from some one in  the congregation which strut in the hole brother Kimball said that was an Omen that we should hav a plenty of mony  to build the temple with (Washigton and Provo all the rest of the Twelve were present) as soon as the turf was taken out the congregation was dismissed and the people rushed to the hole to get a chance to throw a little dirt out. My Father Aphek Woodruff aged 78 years, myself Wilford Woodruff aged 46 years and My Son Wilford Woodruff Jr aged 12 years, all flung out dirt out of the foundation for  this important Temple. After leaving the Temple ground I went  in company with the Presidency and Twele to see the New sugar works opeprate I saw the Hydraulic press oparate in presing out the Juice it was a splendid esstablishment Brother Joseph Russell of Marimichi had furnished about $50000 dollars  to purchase the machinery and apperatus and get it to the valley to make sugar from the beet. My Children Willford, Phebe and Sarah were all present at the breaking of the ground for the foundation of the Temple    ENDENTRY February 15, 1853 ~ Tuesday   Feb 15 A meeting of the seventies was called in the Tabernacle the House was filled. The meeting was opened by prayer by Z Pulsipher. J M Grant Arsose and said this meeting is to transact business, preach and teach the people Regulate the diffent quors andc. The Meeting was then addressed by Z Pulsipher who spoke well and made good remaks   Henry Harriman next followed and spoke to edifycation   Milo Andrews next followed and also Edifyed the people   Harrison Burgess next followed He also spoke well quoted some prophesies said the Seventis were to go out under the direction of the Twelve and build up the Kingdom of God and  regulate all the affairs of the same in all the world who of the seventies are prepared for all this we should improve all our time in treasuring up Knowledge and instruction and dont spend it foolishly for we shall want all the knowledge  we kan obtain in filling our mission to the Nations of the Earth I was baptized in 1832 and have spent more than  half of my life in the work   Adjourned till 2 oclok Met at 2 ock according to adjournment Prayer by W. Woodruff who also addressed the congregation the following are some of the remarks he made. I am always interested in meeting with the saints esspecialy with so many of the Seventies and Elder as are here to day. There never was a school in any age of the world that presents as much of interest to the reflecting mind as the one presenting itself to us in this age not ownly the affairs of the church but the History of the Changes and Revelo- tion of all Nations on Earth. the Time has come when the Earth   ENDENTRY is to be redeemed from the power and dominion of the Devil and the heavens with all the prophets that have ever lived are inluded in the great work the Elders who are before me to day have  this great battle to fight and the victor to win I never saw  a time in any age of my life when I have had more  desire to live than at the present time I want to see the work  progress, the kingdom rise that it may become esstablisd in all the Earth and the Effects that will follow. yes the Elders should improve their time in treasuring up knowledge and counsel for you will want it when you go the Nations  of the Earth dont spent your time in playing cards dice chess or in any such foolish way but improve the time to the best advantage and seek to conquer yourselvs and preside over yourselvs and bring all your passions in subjection to the law of Christ as our president has taught us One item which I count of importance I wish to speak off I wish to exhort the 70s and Elders to keep a Journal and  History of their lives for the record and history of this Church and Kingdom will be wanted in a future day ther has been no dispensation on Earth the procedings of which will be more interesting than the one in which we live. Should we ever have the privilege in our resurrected bodies of visiting other planits and the inhabitants of the same we should want to learn the history of that people if they had  kept no records of their lives, and the dealings of God with them so we could get their History we should feel much disap- pointed so would they should they visit us. it is true that Joseph Smith kept a History of his own life and those things in some measure connected with him He is now dead but his life and Testimony is now being published to the world in seperate peaces in our publications. Also president Young has scribes who are recording his daily acts and life which is right and good. but does that record the life  History and dealings of God with the many thousands of the Apostles and Elders who are or will be in all the world among evry Nation under Heaven No varrily No. then all ye Elders of Israel write your History and the dealings of God with you in all the world for your own benefit and that of your posterity, for the benefit of the House of Israel, for the benefit of Jew and Gentile for the benefit of futur generations, and in fine for the benefit of those celestial beings from other planets who may see fit to visit us either in time or Eternity and wish to visit our libraries and peruse the History of the inhabitants of the Earth esspecially the saints in the last dispensation and fulness of times then write and do not neglect it; many other remarks were made by the speaker which are not recorded Here   Brother Wood next made a few remaks said he would do all the good he could would follow the counsel of the prophets and leave his conscience in the states for he believed the people would be led by the Holy Ghost if they followed the counsel of the prophets who were set to lead them. He thought they were safer than his conscene for paul once thought in all good conscience that he was doing  Gods will by persecuting the saints so his conscience decvd him   ENDENTRY A. P. Rockwood next spoke and said my text is in the words  of the Apostle Wilford that we are the people chosen to build  up the Kingdom this I believe to be true many glorious  principles have been displayed in the words of Brother Woodruff  and they are worthy to be written and handed down to all generations  as it would be profitable for all to read all should write and  learn to write in short hand that we may report speeches and  sermons let us pay up our tithing and obey the authorities that  are put over us the brethren had much rather be brought  before the Authorities of the land than the Church   Meeting adjourned till 6 oclok in the evening when the people met  and about 40 were ordained to the Seventies and remarks made  from several of the brethren    ENDENTRY February 16, 1853 ~ Wednesday   16th Meeting commenced at 10 oclok Brother Greward who had  been to the Islands on a mission preached in the forenoon gave  an account of his mission and closed up by speaking and saying the  Lords prayer in the Tahitain language. I was not present at  his discourse so I could not write it   A Lyman followed at some length said he had no Different  feelings abot the seventies than he had abot the Elders or High priest He was no more partial to one than the other He did not know of any  ordination that was of any benefit to him aside from his own  exheriton He never boasted of any office he had He wished to live  in such a manner that I can say to all men follow me I dont  wish to be under the necessity of citing evry body to follow Brother  Kimball I want to be able to say to all follow me as  I follow Christ many other remarks were made by Brother Lyman   Brother Coleburn made some remarks said he was baptize by Brother Brigham Young in 1833 was ordained an Elder by Joseph Smith   Brother Joseph Young addresed the meeting wished all might soon  be enabled to govern themelvs I am president of the Seventies  and the quorums were set in order by Joseph Smith and I suppose it  is right their is a president over each quorum of the seventies  And I want evry president to keep their quorums in order it is the privilege and duty of evry president to try and cut off any  member of his quorum if they are worthy of it I dont want to  be to slow or two fast but as near the line as I can get. And I wish  others to do the same I wish All the seventies to take the Desarett News  and read it and let your children read it and put it in your library and preserve it. I also want you to sharpen up your swords and keep your arm in  order and learn the art of war and I want all to do military duty Joseph once said if we did not keep our arms in order an enemis  might come upon us as unawares and destroy us but if we are prepared we  need not fear I was at the slaghter at Hauns mill I dont want to see  any more of it. I also want the Seventies to pay up their tithing it has now become a matter of Church fellowship and I hope you will  not forget it   E T Benson followed was rejoiced to hear what he had it had warmed  up his hart I wich to obey the Lord and fulfill my calling we have had  good counsel and we will do well to follow it we are about to begin  another Temple I epect the devil will be mad I dont care if   ENDENTRY we dont stay hare a month if the Lord wants we should go away  when I look back to the days of Nauvoo and compare them with  these days A I am satisfyed that evry move we make is for our  good many said then we could not travel but would be destroyed  Brother Brigham said we could Journey and not a man be lost and it  has proved true we are here and in a good situation yet if ye will live  godly in Christ Jesus ye shall suffer persecution this Kingdom has  to be built up by manual labour I hope this people will soon be in  a situation to live by their own resources and not trust to the Gentiles some  dont pray but a man can no more live without praying than they can  without bread if you dont keep the commandments of God the devil  with use you for his deciple. Blessings will not stick upon an unfaith ful man but they will upon one that is faithful. let us pray in secret  as well as in the family circle any body that dont know that  mormonism is true is not fit to send on a mission the priest of  the day say they preach from the bible I tell them they dont know that  it is true it is true but I know that mormonism is true   Erastos Snow followed and said that he was glad to hear what was  said it was good I am glad to see the seventies together you have  as much of a calling as you can fulfill dont wish for any greater  calling the day has come when this body of men will be  called into immediate action and if evry one of you could be in  20 places at once you would find enough to do it is better to  wear out than to rust out the Seventies are the bone and sinnew  of Israel the Battle Ax of the Almighty what a mighty influence  they must wield in Israel and the world we are begining to  become one as a people Joseph said he had got a lever under  the earth and he ment to turn it over that it might be right side  up the seventies I expect will do much towards turning it over it is for our best interest to build up the Kingdom of God  and do his will   Erastus Snow followed Meeting continued through the evening  some two New quorums of seventies was organized during  the evening but I was not present and could not give particulars  but the evening closed up the meeting for business preaching andc    ENDENTRY February 17, 1853 ~ Thursday   17th I spent the day at home writing    ENDENTRY February 18, 1853 ~ Friday   18th I spent the day at home the west side Jordon hunting  for my horses and cows found my cows but not my horses    ENDENTRY February 19, 1853 ~ Saturday   19 I spent the day at home choring and writing    ENDENTRY February 20, 1853 ~ Sunday   20th Sunday Erastus ^Snow^ addressed the meeting and spoke well He said  FIGURE if he spoke to their edifycation it would have to be by their  prayers and faith he said he felt dull and did not feel as he did while  in the vineyard preaching he felt he said as the little boy at  sea in the storm his Father was captain of the ship and had the  helm and all were afraid of being lost the boy was asked why  he was not afraid he replyed that he had no fear for  dada had the helm and their was no danger so I fell H  dada has the helm here so their is no danger He spoke  of his mission in denmark the Lord showed him that  the King and counsel was taking counsel against him to   ENDENTRY to stop his preaching he herd their conversation in a  night vision but he said as I kept the Law and my brethren  they could find no accusation against me. He exhorted  the Saints to faithfulness and said many interesting things  He was followed by presidet Young   FIGURE President Brigham Young arose and said he does appreciate  the blessings we enjoy. There is no other people on earth that  enjoy as great blessings in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Some suppose  that no people but ourselves have enjoyed the light of the Lord no other people do enjoy the fulness of the gospel but all men more  or less have had the light of the Lord as he hwas LIts light that enlightened  evry man that cometh into the world. we are now living in the  times of times the dispansation of all dispansation none have  put it down no matter how it may be disspiced it is the Kingdom  of God on the Earth hear in our midst. now ask yourselves the  question are you as happy as you expeted you would be when  you got to Zion have you got what you anticipated you would get  All the world cannot disprove this to be the Kingdom of God  Here the Saints are gathered from the states England and other parts  of the world what were your feelings while there it was if I could  ownly get to the valley with the Saints I would be satisfyed for I  cannot bear to stay in the wicked world and hear the blasphemes of the  people but I want to be with the saints, well now are you not  with the saints and are you not the saints then are you happy  whad did you anticipate why it was that there would the blesed  Saints dwell whare there would be no more sin or wickedness and  I shall bask in the smiles of my Lord well how is it now is it as  you anticipated what henders your enjoying all that you anticipated  I can answer it for myself if I dont have all the light truth Joy  and happiness and glory that I anticipated it is because of my vary self and  my will prevents me. All hell cannot hender me if I am right  from enjoying all that I expect. If any other man does wrong  trespasses steals my polls fence or any thing els it is no reason why I should do wrong again, because my neighbor does an evil  It is no reason why I should do an evil in all the days of my life  and say that man that will do right in all things let his Neighbor  do as he may shall have heaven here. Who has got power to cheat  me out of my crown, Glory, Heaven, Kingdom, andc who is it that  has an influence over you who is it ^^ will deprive you of all that  you expect nobody but yor own selves And any body that  does not know enough about salvation to judge what to do  when you are instructed continually are not capable of  receiving a Celestial Kingdom they are not worthy of it  No one that cannot preside over themselves is not worthy of  it but it is those who are valient in the Testimony of Jesus  Christ and bring themselves in subjection to the Law of Christ and say I will serve God let others do as they may.   Another question I will do all I can to ask the Lord for  wisdom all the day long and if I do right am i not capapble of  knowing things for myself I am. when the people first  went to Jackson Co they thought if they could ownly get  there they would be in glory nearly all seemed anxious.  to get there I did not go myself but went into the world  and preached the gospel to the people but by and by the people in   ENDENTRY that I now  will ask if they suffered in their feelings as much as they would have done if they had anticipated the trouble  and known it before No, for they could not bear it the  anticipatin of trouble or happines is far beyongd the reality in this life. Some think they could not bear the  troubles that this Church have passed throgh, but I have passd  through it and bourn it well enough and never felt better  than I have in the midst of the persecutions of the Saints We talk of sacrafize do we sacrafize in the building  of this Kingdom If I had millions and used it in  the building of this Kingdom bwould it be sacrafize No If I was called to go and preach the gospel all the days of  my life and never see my family again it would not  be sacrafize what is our reward for our labour and faithfu- lness it is Thrones, Kingdoms, principalities Eternal  Lives and a seat among the Gods then is it sacrafice No  such thing I believed that all would be better to gather togethe with the saints than to remain in the world I thought all wou- ld be honest I laid aside all my account Books I thought I  should not need to keep any accounts with the saints but I  have found it quite different many do not fell disposed to pay  their debts if they can gag red get rid of it. many of the saints are  fearful. The little time that I talked on the stand to Judge Bro- cchus their was more suffering in the flesh ^and^ in spirit in the  few minutes and for months afterwards than you would suffer  in reality in years of persecution many in their imagin- ation saw us all hung, shot, drown murdered massacred in  evry imaginable shape that you could think off and one reason that you suffer so much more than you expected here in  Zion is you have brought yourselves with you but at last  you will lay down self and it will go to the dust now I want  to give a text for evry body to preach from and that is  take a course to restore confidence throughout the whole  land of Zion and the whole kingdom of God let confi- dence be restored to all men by an upright course  of life and doing right unto all and practice it commence with your family your children. If you give your child any thing for instence a trunk to put their things in dont  never go to that trunk or disturb those things in any wise without the special leave of your child so by your wife any thing that she possesses or that you give her never disturb  that or take any thing that is hers without her leave so  let the wife do by the Husband never disturb any thing that is his without his leave so with children they should never touch any thing that is their parents without their leave. I never opened a trunk belonging to one of my wives in my life but once and that was to get  a portrait to send to the states as I could not wait for  her to return before the messenger left then from your  families let this principle go through your neighborhood  and throughout the whole Kingdom of God pay all men what you owe them fulfill your promises and if your Neighbors Horse  ox cow or any thing that he has is suffering by your door feed  it and save its life as you would if it was your own   ENDENTRY and then let your Neighbors woods poolls fence and evry thing he  has got alone and let all of mine alone and I will yours And in  this way you will restore confidence dont trespass upon any body but do right and the blessings of God will attend you Brother Richards said owe no man any thing I owe gratitude  to God and to all mankigd in a measure but in a measure  or another sens owe no man any thing but do right in all  things and you will have all the Heaven and Zion that you can  enjoy in this world    ENDENTRY February 21, 1853 ~ Monday   221st FIGURE I spent this day in Company with President Young  and had a vary plesant agreeable day with him I dined  with him in company with E.

Prophets and Apostles and all the saints are  edefyed when they hear an Elder preach by the spirit of God the Devil would strive to make you believe that you could not preach and He would take all of the spirit of God from  you if he could. I will tell you what the Lord and the prophets  and Apostles want of all of the Elders and that is that you live  in such a manner that you may be filled with fire so  that you can preach or pray and be filled with the power of  God so as to Edify all. Brother Clawson says that  I am not capable of Edifying this people what does this say that I have been in the dark Now I will give you  the key FIGURE so that you will know how to improve all the lessons  you have to take do right live so that you will have the  spirit of God dont do wrong in any thing dont get Angry  be slow to judge of your neighbor Now the key is to  live so close to God that He cannot hide his face from you  if you do not you will always be dull scholars all your lives you must walk in the light of the Lord or you cannot  Edify and do good you must do it. A man that is in  his place can see all that is going on as well as I could  stand on an eminance and see all that is going on on my  farm. There is no more need of getting mad crossing the plains or in the canyons than their is while setting  in a Rocking Chair or in this Stand if you have the  Spirit of God and keep it then you can learn what their  is to be known. you should pray go to God live in the  spirit of God untill you are full and your bones are filled  with fire.   I am fully satisfyed with what God  has given me I am always satisfyed with what I  have had. I Have had the spirit of God to lead me  while in Joseph had in America for we  have the same God to Assist us in one place as in another  and this will be the case with the Elders in all the world In speaking of the Revolutionary war said we would  not have any national feeling against our brother  or any good man    ENDENTRY September 25, 1853 ~ Sunday to  ENDENTRY September 30, 1853 ~ Friday   25 to 30 I spent the time ploughing and sewing wheat    ENDENTRY October 1, 1853 ~ Saturday   Oct 1st FIGURES I Received one letter from I F Carter and  wrote 1 Letter to J M Bernhisel   ENDENTRY October 2, 1853 ~ Sunday   Oct 2nd Sunday P.
