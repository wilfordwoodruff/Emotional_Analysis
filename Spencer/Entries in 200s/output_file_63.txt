In regard to chairsfor seating, Creation, Garden, Telestial and Terrestrial Rooms in Salt Lake Temple; and suggestions in relation to Font asked for, came to hand yes-terday. ^There are no objections stated I know of in using the seats referred to^ I think the iron chair will do very wellfor the creation room.

Very good, but should not be so [depursed]as to expose the person being baptized to the gaze of spectators on the side, in at event of clothingbecoming disarranged [illegible] of having waterI would suggest the seats for Witnesses as well as Recorderand Confirmers, ^be so arranged that all can see as well as hear the [ceremony]^ As no steps were cast in the three present temples by which to ascend into the confirmation chair I would suggest that this be done after [wiring of] ^The steps for this purpose may be [a creation]^ [aton] of those leading out of the front at west end.Enclosed please to find what are considerpracticable.The place for desk [here] given for the Recorderyou will perceive puts him in the most [available] position to perform the Duty enjoined upon him in the Doctrin andCovenants

 souls into the Church than any one man in the Church; I do not know howthat is. I brought two thousand into the Church in the south of England-in Herefordshire, &c., in 1840; but I never felt to boast or to take anycredit to myself in any of these things, for it was God not WilfordWoodruff that did it. Yet I felt it was a great blessing to be aninstrument in the hands of God of performing siuch a work. So I look uponyou young brethren who are sent now to the nations of the earth to preachthe gospel and save the souls of men. No greater or more glorious workcould you be called to. Therefore, my dear brother, take hold with allyour might. Call upon the Lord in mighty prayer for the Holy Ghost tobe with you to give you power to preach the Gospel and give you souls insearch of your ministry, and the Lord will hear your prayers and giveyou power to accomplish a good mission which will be a satisfaction to yourself and your friends and acceptable unto God who has called you.And this applies not only to yourself, but to every Elder with you, andall who are in the vineyard of the Lord. Therefore, fear not, but laborfaithfully to prune the vineyard once more for the last time and preparethe earth for the coming of the Son of Man. Avoid all evil, resist alltemptations, and the angels of God will be your constant companions.Give my love and blessing to Prest. Naegle and wife and all theElders with you. I am interested in the welfare of every Elder laboringin the vineyard of the Lord.Spencer Clawson's wife died last week and will be buried onSunday. I would be glad to hear from you and know how you are gettingalong. Sister Woodruff, Blanch and Alice join me in love to you and Bro.and Sister Naegle.From your Brother in the Gospel,Wilford Woodruff

 Please excuse this brown sheet it was taken on account of itssize & plainer ruling —Burlington Iowa March 20th 1849Wilford & Phebe WoodruffDear friends Almost two years having elapsed since I left you & the City of Saints & not having recieved one word from you as yet I feel inclin'd to address a few lines to you as I have been won't to do in former daysbut how unlike are my feelings on this occasion to what they formerly were when addressing you by my pen I say  unlike — & why should they not be — seperated from my Companion & Partner in life with whom I have lived & shared the Joys &sorrows attendant upon forty years by nearly two thousand Miles & without any means of obtaining a knowlege of his situation as to body or mind or rather,whether he is comfortable as to body comfortable contended & satisfied in mind or not, & besides this a recollection of the scenes which I have witnessed since I left my home in the East to Travel & mingle with the Saints of the last Days or rather the recollections of many things which transpiered while I was at the Bluffs or which were manifested towards me from time to time some of which th'o small in their nature yet being attended with unfriendly, un-charitable, & as I tho't, undue feelings towards me seems calculated in itsnature to obstruct those avenues from which flow the ready Ideas, the sentiments of friendship & love & a full confidince of addressing a congenial spirit yet I would not wish to be under stood by these remarks that I indulge hard feelings towards you for I do not th'o I thus speak I feel grateful & think I shall never foget the kind attention I recieved from your hands while on our Journey from the east as to the feelings which seemed to be most prevalent towards me afterwards I impute in some degree to the mistaken Idea that I was in favour of Mr Strangs claims but if this was in fact the caseI should think I had not improved much in the delusion if it be such for after having been living with Son Webster & Eunice for nearly two years I have not yet become a Strangite in principle or name. All the reasons I have given my friends to think me wavering on this ground have been manifest in a want of a disposition to oppose Eunice & her husband in their faith I felt it  my duty to give them a hearing as to the reasons they assign'd for pursuingtheir present course & I must say that there were some things which app-eared quite reasonable in relation to the subject still I did not get light in mind on the subject sufficient to over ballance or vie with that which

Utah,to come down with him in theservice of one of his wives; withoutmuch experience, she did not insistmuch on his conditions of payment,thinking because she had got themoney for her emigration from thebrother-in-law of John C. Naegele,Mr. John Beck from Salt Lake City,that she was bound more or less togo with him, though she did notlike very well to go so far south.Now she went and was for about40 weeks at Mrs. Naegele's in Toquer-ville, viz till April 1887; Mr John C.Naegele never paid her any wages,except a pair of shoes of $1.50, wollencloth for a suit of perhaps 3 or 4 dolls,a piece of lady under clothing worth80 c. or $1.00 and $10.00 for her journey

 back to Payson. Miss M Hofmannhad to force her way out of Mr. JohnC. Naegele, viz. insist frequently andstrongly till he would allow herto go out of his home, for he nevertook her down with him but thin-king she would become his wife, asmany of his utterances did show it.Miss Hofmann never thought of suchthing and finally got out throughher firmness. In the month of October1887 she became my wife at Logan,and, as she was still owning forher emigration, I wrote immediatelyto Mr. John C. Naegele, to have topay me for her the sum of $120.00or $3 per week for the 40 weeks shewas in his wife's home, Mrs. RosalieZahler N., writing at the sametime to Pres. McAllister of the St. GeorgeStake (I join his answer to my letter).I did ask $3 per week because Miss 
 had established me in my then present faith neither have I since that time felt any obstrutction in my mind on account of this Doctrine excepting my anxiety to have my children see with me on this subject. I exspect however that some, if not many of the Brethren in Burlington some of which may have gone to the Bluffs have entertained the Idea that I had become a believer in Mr Strang as being call'd to lead the church from the fact that my daughter & her husband were of this faith & withal that I had not formed much acquaintce with them having been confin'd at home for the most past on account of sickness in the family & I think it not at all unlikely that such a report has reached the Bluffs long eer this, But I will digress, I wrote to Azmon soon after I arrived here & informed him of my leaving his Father at the Bluffs& coming to Burlington to make a years visit at Son Webster's exspecting to return the next spring &c, he replied in due season, & congratulated me on my escape from the savage hordes of the western wilds & warned me in the name of Israels god not to think of ever returning there again & that if I did so, I would do it at my peril, at the expenseof bodily comforts if not of life itself he sent me fifteen Dollars & said if I would act wisely & stay where I was he would assist me from time to time, he requested me to write to his father & to tell him that he wanted him to return & come to Richland & tho't if he would set himself to work & use every effort in his power ^tho't^ that he would be able to acco-mplish the journey & when he should find himself at Br Websters he would thenfeel that he could with safety send on help to bring him & Mother to Richland he then adds "if you should ever find yourselfs in the society of your children at Richland I know" (I don't guess) you will never wish to leave for the R. M.he said, he felt, that he could not with any safety send on Money beyound whereI now was to assist his Parents on their Journey to California or if he could do so, it appreared to him that it would be much like assisting a Man with but onearm who someway wanted to contrive to put a rope around his neck to hang himself with, he concluded his remarks by saying that if his Father would not return there was no law either of God or Man that would condemn mefor not returning to dwell with him, he gave me a very handsome invitation to come & make it my home with him, sassuring me that I should never want for any of the comforts of life so long as he had any thing or was able to labour he has written me four or five times a year ago the past winter he lost his DaughterElisabeth which was a great trial to them. Thus you will perceive the inducementsI have had to make up my mind not to return to the Camp for the present yet I do discard the Idea of being influenced by my friends any farther than my own betterJudgment & belief dictated to be right, & consequently for the best. I have enjoyed myself very well since I have been at Burlington Son Webster is doing well has

We lived mostly on Buffalo Meat going Homewithout Bread Arived at Winter Quarters the fore part of Nov, foundour families generally well. And we all spent a good Winter hadgood meetings & councils & the Lord was with us, not a quarteras much sickness as the year before the folks all busy duringthe winter & spring getting ready to go either to the East or WestAfter I got ready with the rest to go to the West, it Was decidedthat I should go to the Eastern States & preside ofover that part, andCanidas, New Brunswick Nova scotia &c And O Pratt go to Englandto preside over the British Isles. So I changed abot & set my facefor the East instead the West I waited However to see the spring capscamps start for the vally.

I have not forgotten the acquaintedI had with you in London & as I expect to be in thatcity again in the course of a few weeks I hope I maybe favored with an interview with you again. I rejoice thatyou continue firm in the faith. When I left Nauvoo I saw Br Kimball he sent a letter by me to you which he wishedme to deliver to you in person, but I will put it with thisin the hands of Elder Davis  he says they will go safe to youso I will forward them, I saw your Brother in New Bedford he sent aletter, by me to you which I forwarded to you on my arivalwhich I hope you got. Many things have transpired since I lastsaw you in the progress of the kingdom of God of much interest& some scenes of sorrow the death of Joseph & Hiram was muchlamented but the power of God has increased in the church sinceJoseph had more of the power of God with him during the last7 months esspecially in the Endowment of the Twelve than everbefore, he was aware he was going to be slain, the work wasnever in as propserous a situation in America as at the presttime.

 steady employ at his Trade getting a good living &c, but as I have remarked in the first part of this sheet a reccollection of the past seems to cast a dark shade both over the scene & ^my own^ mind for I must say that I have been next to being confounded as it regards many things relating to my Journeying West. I set out with a full conf-idence that it was according to the will of God I also felt full confidence in the good feelings of my family friends towards me honestly supposing that I should enjoy all that confidence, good will, & friendship from my relatives that I had been accustomed to from all my particular acquaintances & it is a fact that however unworthy I may have been to recieve the attention, good will &respect of my neighbours & friends heretofore, I have notwithstanding en-joyed a good degree of the Same & have invariably fared the best where I have been most acquainted, & I have had some intimations of the respect which I have formerly had paid to me since I have been at Burlington, Mrs Stare & her Sister Daughters of Mr James The Camp of Farmington have paid all that atte-ntion ^to^ me since I have been here that could even have been asked by a person ofhigh rank, Mr Stare has a splended house which he build in connection with Govenor Clark they live in sight of us. Mrs Stare & Susan have called upon us a number of times they called soon after I came & Mrs S. gave me a very pressing invitation to come & spend a day with them ^&^ to take off any Idea of its being a mere compliment she adds It would seem so good to have a visit with you I have visited them twice & spent the Day in the most agreeable manner I felt my self perfectly at home in their society or as with home friends alth'o they are acc-ounted as some of the most Proud & high feeling Ladies that Burlington offer'dIndeed they live in high stile I have also had Letters from Pennett Redman &I can assure you, they give evidence of having been written in the Spirit of the highest degree of friendship she speaks of my "most precious Letter" (as she termsit) & speaks of the numberless times as it were she calld at the officebefore she read one from me & that the days seemed to her like weeksso great was her anxiety to hear from me she wished me to write her asoften as possible & she would pay the Postage both ways, & remarked that PennettsLetters contained the most news & were the most interesting of (almost) any she had ever perusedBut it is not my wish or design to boast of friends or of any particular attention paid meby distinguished persons, my object is simply to contrast the general feelings of formerDay friends towards me with those which have been manifested towards me by relatives & those under their special influence since I came west. But I do not presume to complain of my living while with you as to provisions &c, for if ^I^ had felt no greater trials than what I exs-perienced from the privations I suffered they would have been small setting aside from instances in which a bad feeling was manifested towards me by yourself Son Wilford, whoever might have been the causeof it—once in particular when I took it upon me to go in the room & in behalf of your honored Fatherto ask for somthing ^to^ eat as he felt backward about going & you hesitated about it saying everything fell upon you to do, &c, & when I replied that I did not know what we should do having nothing at all to eat you said I know what you can do, you mustn't eat so much—did you concider that your Parents had but one thing at a time to eat & that a great allowance aught to be made on thisaccount as well as for your having put one of your family join with us, as also, the amount of the exspression made to me, but you will excuse the length of my remark as I had no Idea of pat^r^iticularizing on this, I however feel constraind to state to you on this sheet some things which th'o small in their nature have nevertheless lain with serious weight on my mind (but as my sheet is already full with croocked marks & blots I must conclude on another piece I should indeed copy this were not my time for writing so limited & it is forthis reason that this sheet contains so great a variety as to the writing having to improve my most wearied moments in the penning of the same for which I trust you will make allowance

 There seemed to be from time to time while at the Bluffs conciderable effort exerted to prove meout guilty of something, or somewhat, or of some misdemeanour of conduct but after all I could not find that there was any thing of a tangible nature or at least so much so as to be productive of any evil whatever but not so with the things which I have to speak of for indeed some of them were of weighty consequences for who can deny that a persons reputation & character is not worth more to them than almost anything else of an earthly nature & now I must say that I did while at the Bluffs recieve slighly treatment from some very respectable sisters in the church for no other cause than having had an unfavorable account of my person from those who should have been my friends as it was evident from the particular attention & kind feelings which they manifested towards me for a time after our first acquaintance with each other & then becoming so cool, reserved, & distant all at once as tho they viewed me a different person from they had before & in one or two instances I had evidences of its being through your instrumentality Phebe that I had this treat-ment, once in particular you acquainted me with a sister, & before we got to our Journeys end & she treated me very politely indeed but it was not long before I saw you conversing with her not far from me & it was evident to ^my^ mind that I was the topic of your conversation from the fact that you both alternately eyed me with a very curious sort of look & in the conclusion this sister gave me a look exspressive of great disdain & al-th'o she would seem in a measure friendly when I saw her yet never appeared as before this occurance, & it is a fact that there were a number of some of the most respectable sisters from whom I recieved a similar coldness of treatment after having been made the recipient of some of the warmest exspressions of friendship from them, & now I wish to say that it is not my man-ner to complain of any want of attention shown me by respectable persons or any others where I have had a good acquaintance & no reasons for supposing their minds have been biassedeven should I be treated with disrespect in short I am ready in general to put up with that degreof attention & respect which such persons account me as meriting from them but I can never feel that the course pursued with me while at the Bluffs in regard to these things [[illegible is according to godliness or agreeable to the ordinary rules of civility Indeed there were various other things which were calculated in their nature to give one the worst of feelings especially where there was a consciousness of not having deviated from the strictest rules of civility & good behaviour in any othf their conduct as I can with safety say was the case with my-self altho I do not lay claim to perfection in anything, stilI I do profess so much of it as to be able to avoid any course of conduct which would merit those things to which I allude asfor instance Phebes remarking that she did not love Mother Woodruff & never could & that she did not care whether she was comfortable or not, (as I was credibly informed by a friend) & in another instance that, she said, she would give most anything if she could love me but enough of this it makes my heart sick & tho I might perhaps make use of a similar exspression with as much propriety yet I will only say that I have ever loved & respected Phebe since our first acquain-tance & I do feel a confidence that I ever treated her while on our Journey with all that friendship &good feeling which would be possible for anyone to do, under the same circumstances & I can give no reason at all why I should not have enjoyed the good feelings & confidence of the more respectable, as formerly while at the east except it were in those things I have named & my being a stranger there. But I would like to communicate to you some of my present feelings in relation to my returning & going on to the Valley as I exspected when I left, as to my faith it is the same it ever has been & there has been nothing which has seem'dto block up my way so much in regard to going forward as the fact, if my constitutionshaving been so broken down by disease as to compel me to the making use of such articleof medicine daily in order to be in any measure comfortable which is attended with some conciderable exspense & thinking that you might not feel yourself able to do this or might not be willing to be at the exspense of the same for which reason I have been influenced to accept the solicetations of my children thus far in my calculations to make it home with them, but tho I should be extremely happy to make Azmon

I am a believer in the principals of the Church of Jesus Christ of laterday saints, Willing and wishing to obey the call made on me by the pr^i^estood of God, Yet at the same time the notification was so long on the road I had no chance to get ready.The date on which I received your letter was Feb 27th 7 P.M. only giving me 3 days to prepare in as the other 7 days would be taken up in traveling between here and S. L. City. Which time would have bin all the time I would have asked if my business had bin in a shape to leave but it was not as I had heard nothing about being calld before I received the notification My finan-cial affairs are in a mixed condition. Forinstance I have took a contract to build a house which is up to the square. I have soldsome land which has bin bought of a Mexican there is some trouble about the deeds of said land I have obligated myself to pay some more to a party in S. L. City. Have just sent a order for some thing to keep house with as I was expecting to get married about the 1st of Apr. I have bought a house and lotand sold the same for brick and lum-ber the same is not paid for or in others words I have not received my pay for the same with many other affairs which would be use-less to mention.

In 1885, I had a similar call and readily responded; but at that partic-ular time I occupied a position in which it was considered I was more valuable at home than abroad.

Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City.Dear brother:Not long sinceI received a call to labor in the missionaryfield in California and to leave in January next. I assented most gladly. Since that time,however, conditions (financial) have undergonea change and I feel that an extension of timewould prove a great accommodation to me.I would not consent to a release under anyconditions. From present indication I canarrange to leave in one year from the presenttime quite conveniently. We are without a home—or any other property and it is necessary for meto make provision not only for myself but alsofor my wife during my absence.It will be a pleasure for me to go to any partof the world I may be directed to go to. However, ifI should exercise a choice I should suggest GreatBritain or Germany, with a preference for the latter. If there is any place where my wife could assist inthe work she could, accompany me with very little more expense than by remaining home. These matters, of course, are left entirely in your hands and we will abidegladly by your decision. Sincerely hoping an extension willbe in harmony with your feelings, I am, your brotherD. H.

 P.S. Kindly favor me with an immediate reply. I am very anxious to know at once. D. H. ChristensenVery good. Let him have a years extension. I do not think it would be wise to take hiswife to Eng. or Germany, unless calledto do work in the Star Office - I wouldsuggest that he go to Europe — or Eng.and let Prest. Lund — or whoever maybe in charge to appoint his fieldof Labor. J. F. S.[written in sideways text] D. H. ChristensenAug. 24 [18]95 [end of sideways text]
