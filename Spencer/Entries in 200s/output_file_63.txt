Dear Brother:  About a year ago I received a letter from the Missionary Committee inquiring if it would be consistent with my feelings and circumstances to take a mission. I replied that it would be a pleasure to me to respond to any call made of me through the Priesthood, but that I had a  mail contract which would not be completed until July of this year. I then received another, requesting me to report to you whenever I found myself in a position to respond to a call to preach the gospel.  In compliance with which, I now take the liberty to report that I shall be through withe  my mail contract on July 1st next. It will take me some little time—probably a month or six weeks after that— to finish up my business; And then if my services are need^ed^ I shall hold my self subject to your call.

It is a general time of health throughout the Territory so far as we can learn.  Your collections of fruit and flowers will be thankfully received, and care taken to preserve and propogate from them. Bro England on the 10th ult, and requested Bro Leo Hawkins to receive all fruit cuttings and intended for him.  There has been, and is a great spirit of reformation throughout the Territory, especially in Davis County, some of the wards in that county stepping forth to a man and requesting rebaptism. Prest Grant baptised upwards of eighty with his own hands. We never have had such pointed, plain and strong ^mormon^ sermons since the foundation of the Church, as are now preached by the Presidency on this subject.  On the 26th ult, the Presidency, with the Brass Band, a detachment of the Lancers, and a number of the citizens left the city at 9 a. m., to meet the Hand Cart Companies under Elders Daniel D. McArthur, they met them at the foot of the little mountain, and escorted them into the city, where they arrived about 5 1/2 P.M. The feelings  of the brethren on meeting them cannot be described; their hearts were so full that they could not find utterance. The brethren in the different wards dealt out provisions andc liberally to them. We feel that it is  ENDENTRY  G. S. L. City April 1 1857.  Elder Erastus Snow Dear Sir,  The Eastern mail arrived on the 24th. Ulto.  bringing the last Oct. and Nov. mails; containing 28 Brass locksacks: it brought many letters to Prest. Young; and 17 to myself. Among others, I received letters from Elders E. T. Benson, J. M. Bernhisel, and one from yourself, bearing date Sep. 25 1856. The Mail was accompanied by Elder J. L. Heywood, they had to winter at Devil's gate: the company suffered much from the want of food. There were about 20 of our brethren there, and they all lived about one month on ox hides: they left their winter Quar- ters as soon as they possibly could get through in consequence of  the snow, and it was with great difficulty they got through when they did. We have not heard any word from the  winter mails, but have learned that the snow was very deep both East and West of Laramie. We have had more snow in the mountains and vallies throughout the Territory than we have ever known before since we came here. The snow is now  off from the vallies, but the mountains are deeply clad. We  have lost but little stock during the past winter in comparison to the loss we sustained the previous Winter.  We have had much later news from you and the brethren East via the California mail.  As fas as news is concerned with us in Utah I will say we are having universal health, peace and plenty throughout the Territory so far as I know.  Spring has broken upon us warm and mild, every kind of fruit tree that has suffificiently matured is loaded with ENDENTRY Historian's office. G. S. L. city april 1 1857  Dear bro. Benson  The Eastern mail finally got in on the 24th. Ult.  bringing 28 sacks of mail. It brought the Oct. and Nov. mail: it brought me over 15 letters from E. Snow andc. and  also your interesting letter from Copenhagen of Sep 30. I should have  been delighted to have been with you on your journey through those old countries: it must have been very pleasant and I feel to rejoice to see how the work of the Lord grows in the midst of all opposition,  I know it will grow till it fills the whole earth. Bro. Brigham said the other night at the prayer circle, that he was satisfied that the Lord would soon open a door in the midst of all these nations, he said he  would like to send a man to Japanese islands andc.  There will be a company of Missionaries selected for Europe at the Conference all will go with hand carts from the vallies to the States: bro. Mack- intosh is among the number.  We have had a very interesting winter both in the Legislature and in the church. The Twelve have stood at the head of some 40 missionaries for this city. I have attended a meeting about every evening for 5 months; the power of God has been with us and much of the Holy Spirit poured out. We have had some of the loudest preaching this winter I ever heard, the fruits of the Reformation have been very visible; the people have confessed their sins, whether they have been great or small, and made restoration as far as possible—the thief has returned the stollen property or done what they could at it. all have been down into the waters of baptism commencing with the Presidency ENDENTRY Historian's office. G. S. L. City April 1 1857.  Brother Geo. A. Smith; Dear Sir,  I take pleasure in announcing to you that the Eastern mail arrived on the 24th. Ulto.: bringing 28 brass lock sacks, having left 2 by the way; it brought the last Oct. and Nov. mail: anything later we have not heard by the Eastern mail. The mail was accompanied by our friend Devils gate with about 20 of the brethren. They suffered much: subsisting for one month on poor beef, and the next month on Hides. Brother  Heywood considers he has gained quite an experience in cooking raw hides, they boiled, roasted, stewed and fried all ways; they all lived through it and left as soon as they could get through for snow, and came near leaving the mail at last. Many had much anxiety about brother Hey- wood and all were glad to see him come home: he looks well with his long sandy beard. The mail brought me 6 letters from you including the one sent by A. W. Babbitt who, as you know was killed by the way. I was truly glad to hear from you and that you was preserved in the railroad smash up.  I was glad to hear that you had got along so well with bro. Joseph. I have not yet seen it, I have not heard how it was sent, if by mail, I expect it will turn up by and bye when the Winter mails arrive I called on Bathsheba and read all my letters to her: she had received letters from you too. I was pleased with your dream and I believe that  you will be enabled to start the cars engine or no engine that is visible, it will be all right anyway. We will file it in the office.  We have had a hard winter in Utah if 8 feet of snow in  the vallies, and from 1 to 100 in the mountains makes a hard winter ENDENTRY  G. S. L. City Sep 30, 1856 Hon. G. A. Smith, Dear Sir,  At a late hour in the night I seat myself  to write a few lines to you as the mail goes out on the morrow, it is universal peace, health and prosperity throughout this country as far as I know. We are having a very favorable fall to do all kinds of work, except to sow wheat, it still continues dry, wells are failing. some think the cutting of the timber on the mountain heights is partially the cause. Our early Frosts have injured the late corn, wheat has come in quite well considering that we have had no rain or water. The people are selling their wheat as usual for $1.00 and $1.50 Flour $2.50 and $3.00 and $400 per cwt. notwithstanding we have just passed through a famine, these things ought not to be, for I think the people will want bread before another harvest. Some brethren have returned from Carson valley, they do not like the country very well, besides they have to fight their way measur- ably among the Gentiles. I received a letter from Gen. Rich from  San Bernardino by the mail to day, they are all well there as far as I can learn. The vigilance committee in San Francisco have dis- banded, having hung all the wicked, and driven the guilty off.  Elder N. V. Jones has just come in from the lead mines reports all right in that quarter. We have moved into our new office and find it much more convenient and very comfortable and refined, we have got the History as far as the organization of the church with Prest.  Young and the Twelve at its head.  One of the most interesting events of the kind in this church and kingdom was the arrival of two companies of the ENDENTRY Historian's Office  G. S. L. City. Oct 31, 1856  Dear Brother Geo A. Smith,  Although it is the last of  Month the Eastern mail has not arrived, and we do not  expect it until about the 10th or 15th of November, if by any  accident it should chance to drop in on us then—for our  present contractors are not at all to be relied on.  Two messengers have just arrived from the hand  cart company under Elder J. G. Willie: When they left, the company was two miles below Sweetwater. They bring bad news of that company; through starting so late in the season they have got caught in the snow-storms  and many have died. When the teams sent out at conference  arrived at this camp, there had been twenty deaths—nineteen  of them men, and while with them in one day there were  fifteen burials, and when the messengers left there had been  fifty five deaths. They did not seem to be sick, but chilled  through: men would dig graves for their brethren, and  before night would die themselves. They had distributed  their last rations the night before relief came to them and  they did not know that any was at hand. Nothing had  been heard of the last company of hand carts. They have  had several severe storms, although there is not so much  snow between here and Sweetwater, as below that point  At least 250 teams have been sent out to meet those  companies, and several tons of flour, and great quantities  ENDENTRY Historian's Office, G. S. L. City September 30th 1856.  Hon. J. M. Bernhisel, Dear Sir,  I write to say that your wagon and three yoke of oxen and goods all came safe. I think Bro Millett has taken great pains to do well and get the cattle through. He and his wife have walked all the way, nearly. One of the oxen was sickly: They were delivered to Brothers Cain, and I suppose they have been put upon the range. The wagon is in my yard, sound and whole. Bro. Millet had to obtain some things in order to get along, to the amount of $6 or $8; the flour that was given him was adulterated with some mineral. He had to leave in storage at Florence, the following articles, as he had too much load:  1 Parlor Stove. 1 Box Glass 5 Sheets of Iron. 1 Keg Linseed Oil. 1 Keg White Lead, 50 lbs 1 Grass Seed Separator.  Signed, James McGraw B. Woolley.  I put one of the Boxes in my house, and put into it every thing you directed which had come. I delivered to Mrs Bernhisel all the articles as directed, and she called and got a bill of goods at the retail price, was $146.26. I have a bill of the articles. ENDENTRY like opening the flood gates of deliverance to the thousands of Europe, who are bound for the want of means; it having been now proven that this thing can be accomplished, these companies having travelled about 1400 miles on foot, drawing their provisions and bedding in hand carts all the way, and beaten every ox team on the road.  The Deseret State Fair was held in the Deseret Store in this city on the second, third, and fourth, insts., and it truly was delightful to witness the splendid display of home manufactured goods which were there exhibited: it has developed the talent and ability of Utah's artizans in a degree that exceeded our most  sanguine expectations, and we trust it will give an impetus to home manufactures which will continue to roll until we no longer will have to expend the best of our means in the purchase of imported goods (A report we expect will appear in the Deseret News). The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing  Society, since their organization have been laboring diligently to bring about this desirable object, and it is gratifying to witness the success of their efforts. The plowing match came off on the 2nd inst., on Prest. Young's land immediately south of the city, and the exhibition of stock on the 3rd.  Elders D. Spencer N. H Felt have just arrived  Yours Truly. W. Woodruff ENDENTRY fruit buds, many ready to burst into blooms. I think we will have a very fruitful season for fruit, grains and vegetables the  ground is well soaked with water from the recent deep snows.  The big cotton wood canal is nearly finished and will  soon be ready to receive the water for irrigation, and loading the Granite for the Temple: there are now many stone-cutters at work around the Temple and we expect their numbers will be  greatly increased after conference; it is pleasing music to hear the sound of the hammer and chisel again.  The past has been a very interesting winter with us  in Utah. The Presidency, Twelve and many others have been  very busy during the winter holding meetings with the people, the spirit and power of God has been with us. I have attended meetings with the Heads or in the Quorums every night through the week, bro. F. D. Richards has been with me most of the Winter, O. Hyde part of the time.  We expect C. C. Rich about the first of May. I expect they will take a European mission.  The Presidency and most of the Twelve here and many others are expecting to take a trip North as far as Salmon river.  Brother Erastus, I want to say to you that Brothers Frank- lin, Lorenzo and myself have often met together and at times Brother Hyde with us we have often spoke of you and felt, much to sympathise with you, and felt to sustain you with our faith and prayers for we do realize that you have had  a great care and labor upon you. I expect Prest. Young will liberate you this Spring, and send H. S. Eldridge to succeed you and let you rest from your labors awhile, so I want you ENDENTRY Historians office. G. S. L. City April 1 1857  Elder Taylor  Dear Sir,  Our Eastern Mail for October and November arrived in this city on the 24th. inst.; containing 28 brass lock sacks; 30 were sent, but 2 of them were deposited somewhere. The Mail has grown several months old while on the way, mostly at J. L. Heywood, who reports, that while weather bound at the Devils gate, the  company suffered much for the want of food; having subsisted  for one month on Ox hides entirely. The Mail company left  that point as soon as they could possibly get through the snow; and it was with great difficulty they got through when they did. The Mail brought Prest. Young a great many letters, (and to me the following: 2 from yourself, of dates Septem. 16 and October 18 respectively: 5 from Hon. Geo. A. Smith, July 8,  27, Augt. 10, Septem. 14 and Oct 22: Elder Erastus Snow Sept. 25: Hon. Joel M. Berry Sep:  1 and Oct. 13, and Messrs. E. T. Benson  Portland Maine.) We have  not yet had any word from the Mails of the winter months, but we have learned that the snow was very deep East as well as West of Laramie. We have had more snow in the  mountains and vallies through this Territory than we have ever seen since our settlement in these mountains; yet there has  been but a small amount of stock lost in comparison to the loss last season.  I was truly gratified to hear from you by letter and ENDENTRY followed by the Twelve. Our Tabernacle, school houses, and all places,  of worship have been filled to overflowing throughout the Territory. The people are paying their Tithing, the public store houses are well filled with grain. Many are getting wives and their Endowments. Prest. Young is nearly worn out waiting upon the people day and night. He is  expecting to leave this Spring, with H. C. Kimball the Twelve, (except myself) and about 100 others on a tour to Salmon river to see the country.  We have had the most snow ever known in this Territory the past Winter; snow has fallen in our city over 8 feet deep by measurement; this has well soaked the ground, and I think we shall have a very fruitful season, all fruit trees are loaded with fruit buds. They are getting a head well at Tooele. I see bro. Rowberry frequently, they have got a reformation at Clark to the Presidency and Cooley has given it up. Your flouring mill is running, your family are well. I see sister Benson occasionally. I do not have any time to visit with my own family.  The Bishops and various companies are sending to the States for sheep. A good many of us will plant some chinese sugar cane in the valley this season and try it, we think it will be of great benefit to us. There has hardly been a Ball or party of pleasure in this Territory for this six months. I am very busy on the History.  A few will go to California this Spring, some few in the Southern settlements have started for California, by the short rout called the cut off. I expect some others will follow them soon for they do not love to dwell with the righteous. There is a company going to the Santa Clara to  raise cotton. The brethren have made out 1200 lbs of lead and  abandoned the business, as it is very expensive, and does not pay nor work as well as expected. I shall be pleased to hear from you from  ENDENTRY ^see next page 455^ seen this people feel the importance of living their religion as much as they have done the past winter and hope it will continue to the power of God has been with them their preaching and teaching in all the  Quorum and Ward meetings. I commenced with J. M. Grant before he died, and after his death the burden of the care of the Missionaries rested upon me and brother F. D. Richards who was unwell considerable, but attended most of the time. O. Hyde have been  with me a part of the time. The Presidency and Twelve (except  myself) and about 100 others are expecting to go on a summer Trip North to Salmon river.  This spring C. C.  Rich will be with us about the  first of May. I expect they will take a European mission, some missionaries  will be called to Young would like to send a mission to Japanese islands. The Lamanites  are doing well, Kanosh with other chiefs are making  great improvement. Arrowpeene preached a short discourse in the Tabernacle  lately, it was good.  We have given up the Lead mines after making about 10 or 12.00  lbs; it is quite expensive and does not work as well as expected. a cotton  company are called to go to the Rio Virgin. We are going to try the  chinese Sugar cane this summer as far as we can get seed.  All is peace and prosperity with us throughout this Territory. some are going to California this Spring, several in the Southern settlements  have started on the short roads, or cut off to go there, and no doubt  some others will follow them soon.  Your family are all well, you and  the brethren associated with you are earnestly remembered in our prayers.  As far as the History is concerned, we finished matters up to text continues on the top of the page interlinearly the death of Joseph as far as we could; then brought up the  other matters including the history of the Twelve up to the  organization of the church Augt. 8. I then have taken up the  history of Brigham Young and his fathers family briefly, and now am at work with the history of the Twelve, from their first organization  in a brief form, taking all that belonged to it, up to the 8  August 1844. We have no trouble now with the Gentiles here  in court or any where else. It would amuse you to read one of the late  scenes while in court filed in our office—too lengthy to insert,  with Dr. Burr and some smaller fry, to bullyrag  all our laws and their defenders, a part of them came armed with  colts, revolvers, it ended in T. S. Williams resignation and Gen. Burr's  dismissal from the Bar; and some others who intended to use the pistols  went out of the house in the form of a sled using the seat of  their honor for runners, dropping their loaded weapons while going  rest of page illegible ENDENTRY hand cart trains. the Presidency with many others, and a company  of Lancers went out to meet them in the mountains, they met them about the foot of the little mountain, it was an effecting scene, after passing the greetings and salutations they formed to come into the city, one half of the Lancers in front followed by the presidency, citizens, band and marshal, then followed 500 men, women and children drawing their 100 hand carts, which they  had drawn 1400 miles, the rear was brought up by the Lancers.  As they went through the city, the Streets were crowded with thousands of people who stood and gazed with wonder and amazement tiars starting in their eyes, the scene was beyond description, to behold old men women and children covered with dust dancing with joy as they passed along it filled our hearts until we were spechless, we felt that the flood gates of deliverance to the millions of the  oppressed were hoisted, and we could say to the poor Saints "come home to Zion",  for your way is open. Elders Mcarthur have gained great honor to themselves by leading that brave company of hand cart pioneers, they walked all the way, helped along the carts, healing the sick and comforting the weak all they could, and when they arrived in the city, they continued at the head of  their companies, drawing the hand carts covered with dust, till their companies were safely encamped on the Public square, and were fed by the presents of the populace: then the brethren went to see their own families. Prest. Young has been sanguine all the time that travelling with hand carts was a safe and practical operation, and it has now been proved to be so. the company declare the few ox teams they had were a hindrance to them, they had to wait ENDENTRY of clothing.  Brother Smoot had to leave 100 head of cattle at  Bridgets, and most of his freight.  The President has suggested the idea of establishing  posts, one at Deer Creek, and one below Laramie, to put a stop to so late  starting.  The Presidency started East to meet the Immigration  but while on Young was taken so severely ill that the company was obliged to return.  Your family are all well.  Yours truly. W Woodruff ENDENTRY Brother Cain has drawn some wood with your oxen to your house. Houtz has begun to bring some flour of late. His Mill does all the grinding in that place: he runs it nearly night and day.  I have written to Hon. Geo. A.

Woodruff ENDENTRY G. S. L. City July 1 1857  Brother Lyman Wight Dear Sir  I take the liberty of addressing a few lines to you for various reasons, one is for old acquaintance sake, and another for the purpose of making a request of you, and upon this subject I will write first, it is this. During the last year I  have been engaged in writing the History of the church and especially the History of the Twelve. I am taking up the Quorum from the commencement, have been trying to write your History but I cannot do justice to it at all without your assistance, and on the receipt of this I wish you would write a sketch of your life and forward it to me to this city, name your lineage or forefathers as far back as you can get, with anything you know about them, and where you was born and when, what your religion was before you embraced  the Gospel, where you was baptized and who by and all your ordinations, and by whom ordained—an outline of all your missions. Was you not in the war of 1812? What offices have you ever held in church or state. I want you to give me the particulars of your conversation with General Wilson the night you was taken prisoner when he wanted you to betray Joseph, that was an important time with you, and for that deed alone you shall have salvation; give me an account of your going with Judge Higbee some 6 or 7 miles to  intercept a company of 40 men going I think to Jackson County also of the 7 men armed, who chased you on a certain occasion, when you leaped a ditch with your horse which the others could not leap, and  any incident of your life that should be preserved as History; please ENDENTRY time to time to know how you get along: it seems our brethren at Washington have not been able to accomplish anything with our imorial for a State government yet, but I believe that the Lord will govern it all right.  If we have any more emigration from England this Spring or Summer, I hope they never will start so late as they did last season: it cost this city and territory more to get them brought through the  snow, than it would to have paid their fare all the way from Liverpool.  during emigration time it was by miracle almost that they were saved at all, about every horse and mule team within 40 miles of here had to go out in the mountains from 1 to 10 weeks. I lost my lot frm horse and wagon left andc: it cost tens of thousands of dollars to close up the operation. My love to all who inquire after me.  As ever I remain, yours truly, W. Woodruff ENDENTRY to keep up good courage, do what you can and dont worry about the rest. I feel as though the Lord will sustain you, and bring you home in peace.  In answer to your inquiry about the proportionments of the  Deseret alphabet Fonts; I would say I had that portion of your letter read to Prest. Young, and he said your letter of instructions expressed the desired information, which he would have re-copied and sent you again by this mail. He wishes you to get a few made, not as full font, but some of each kind and have them tried, and see if they  will work, then to bring on the maillegibles and pictures so that we can make those here as we have a good deal of old type, but as you will have a bill of instructions again from him upon the subject I need not enlarge further. I hope you will be successful in this matter. The Presidency are very singly busy in the Endowment house.  Enclosed you will find a letter to Geo A. Smith which if he is with you, or in, the States please forward to him: Your  family and all the families of the Twelve are well. I have been so busy during the winter in attending meetings and the labors of  my office that I have hardly had any time to visit any body, hardly  my own familys. I feel to pray with all my heart that the Lord will bless and sustain you, in your work and missions, and that you may have grace equal to your duty and return again in peace, to your family and friends during the Summer.  As ever, I remain Yours truly W. Woodruff ENDENTRY ^from page 455^  earnestly remembered in our prayers.  As far as the History is concerned, we finished matters up to the death of Joseph as far as we could; then brought up the other  matters including the history of the Twelve up to the organization of the church Augt. 8. I then have taken up the history of Brigham Young and his fathers family briefly, and now am at work on the history of the Twelve from their first organization in a brief form taking all that belonged to it up to the 8 August 1844.

Please not expose my succatash letter to the press, for I write for your own benefit and amusement, not guarded as I would  while writing to men who publish papers.  Gen. Burr has written to the department as we are informed, accusing us of cutting off and wasting the government timber in the Kanyons. I expect he will have an invitation this Spring of going to the upper mill in big cottonwood kanyon, and taking  a ride down to Jordan on the top of a big pine log, (if he can stay on the top of it) and when he has finished his trip, if he thinks it will not cost all it is worth to get it, we will pay to Government all that is over, leaving him to be the judge. yours truly W. Woodruff ENDENTRY several hours each day for them, they consider they would have been here 10 days sooner without them, were provisions left at various points for them, they came through in about 9 weeks and a  few days.  We are in the commencement of a great reformation, the Presidency are preaching the strongest and most heart searching and  powerful sermons that I ever heard delivered in the church and kingdom of God, they are weighing the people in the balances  and the people are found wanting, the President has called upon the people en masse to repent and be baptized for the remission of sins and they are following their council by whole  wards in some places, and I expect it will be the case in this city.  The Southern Company brought in the small pox with them but it has not spread much yet.  We are making great preparations for our State fair to be held in the Deseret store. The awarding committees occupy it to morrow to adjudge upon the various articles which may be presented, then it will be open to the public, it would do your soul good to go through the building and see what the people have produced in this valley—it is really a rich treat.  Your family are all well. Bathsheba is on one of the awarding committees. George A. works very smart, our peaches grapes and apples are doing very well this season.

Elder Orson Pratt, Dear brother  The Cala. mail for Feby. arrived here March 4th. bringing packages containing the pamphlet entitled the "Holy  Spirit." The Eastern mail for Oct. and Nov. arrived on the 24th. Ult. bringing packages of your pamphlets entitled "The true faith" "True Re- pentance" and "water baptism," which have been distributed according to the respective addresses. This mail has been detained during the Winter in the mountains, by the severity of the weather and the unusual depth of snow. Elder Joseph L. Heywood was with the Mail and suf- fered very much on account of the lack of provisions. They lived one month on Hides, boiled and prepared in the best manner they could. It has been reported the snow was very deep on the plains Eastward.  There is quite a spirit manifested this Spring through the Territory in the cultivation of fruit, many are selling out fruit trees of all kinds that can be obtained. There is every prospect for a very fruitful season of fruit, grain, and vegetables; the Earth is well saturated from the moderate melting of large bodies of snow.  The Temple block begins to assume its industrial appearance, and already the huge blocks of rock, are being brought from Red Bute on which the sound of the hammer and chisel again are heard.  The big cotton wood canal is nearly finished so that we expect water to be more plentiful in this city, as well as on the farming lands.  Theire has been organized a company to raise cotton on the Santa Clara under the superintendence of bro. I. C. Haight.  There is quite a number of parcels of chinese sugar cane here, and many others on the way which will be cultivated with care and ENDENTRY to learn that you had prepard for us an account of the mar- tyrdom of the Prophet. I did not learn in what way you  intended to forward it to us, whether by mail or private conveyance; if by mail I expect we will have it when the Winter mails get in. We have had much later news from you and the brethren, through the Mormon, and by letters via California; than we received by the last Eastern mail. The Mormon keeps us well posted up upon matters and things in general in the East. We can clearly see that you have had a strong war- fare upon your hands since your residence in New York, and I believe all your friends in Utah feel that you have ably defended yourself; and maintained the cause of truth and that victory has been with you as an able Editor and a  champion of rights. I consider the Mormon has been from the commencement as a sharp thorn in the side of the enemies of Zion, and a powerful engine in the defence of the truth and has been an instrument in the hands of God of  doing much good.  As far as news is concerned with us in Utah I will  say that we are having universal health, peace and plenty throughout the Territory so far as I know.  Spring has broke in upon us warm and mild, snow having disappeared ^in the vallies^; though the mountain and hills still wear their white mantle, and are deeply clad with snow.  The big cottonwood canal is nearly finished and will soon receive the water for irrigation, and also for canal purposes, by which we will be able to boat the Granite rock from the Temple.  ENDENTRY forward to me soon. Give my respects to Sister Orange, and any with whom I am acquainted.  We are all well, it is a general time of peace, health and plenty in this Territory at present—never a better prospect for crops. Our Eastern mail arrived on the 23rd inst. being the quickest trip ever  made (25 days) from Independence 1200 miles.  We are informed all hell is boiling over against the Mormons. McLean—he was shot—lived 2 hours. T. B. Marsh is on the way to this place—wishes  to be forgiven and to return to the church again.  I wish Brother Wight you would come and pay us a visit. we will all be glad to see you. we have built up a beautiful city in the valley of the Mountains. Our census makes us about 80,000 souls and increasing fast—mormonism is as great a trouble to  the world as ever. All the Twelve are now in this country except John Taylor who are abroad San Bernardino, and Geo. A. Smith from Washington.  I hope you will not fail to write me by the next mail Will you tell me who baptized Wm. E. McLellan and when? My family are all well. I have but one son grown up 17 year old named Father is with me— 80 years old—is able to work about every day. I baptized him 20 years ago, and brought him to this valley. I find the world is  much bothered to know what to do with Utah. Heber and Orson Hyde are all well.  I remember old times we have spent many a good day together, and I wish we could spend many more.

The Eastern mail has not arrived yet.  The weather for the last week has been moderately warm; snow disappearing fast, in many places the ground is now bare, inviting the  Plough and the spade of the agricultarist: some have commenced Gardening.  Many wards have about finished their labors on the Big Cottonwood canal and the prospect for water this season is encouraging.  Sab. 22 A list of Missionaries for Europe and the islands was called off, to which it is anticipated more will be added; there was also read a list of names called to accompany Prests. Kimball on their Northern trip to Salmon river to start after the April conference.  I earnestly desire O. Pratt that you should write out a short sketch of your life for the church History. We have now come in the History compil- ation to the period when Prest. Young with his brethren of the Twelve Preside over the church, and we give a short history of each of the Twelve say from 8 to 12 pages foolscap, which be pleased to forward by return mail as we will in all probability be waiting on it.  Say to br. Benson the same will be required of him when the history comes up to the date of his ordination.  Please also tell br. Phinehas that we want a brief sketch of his life as we are compiling a short sketch of each one of the Brothers and sisters of bro. Brigham, their families, their missions, and important events in their lives. all these sketches will be required from your birth till Augt. 8 1844 when the  history of the church becomes the history of Br.

Pratt Dear Brother,  As the mail will soon leave, I  improve a few moments to keep you advised of matters with us. It is a general time of health and peace throughout our Territory: all things are going right and prospering.  One of the most interesting scenes that was ever witnessed  in our Territory was the arrival of two of the Hand Cart Companies, on the 26th inst. Having heard the night  previous that they were camped between the two mountains, Presidents Kimball, and many citizens, with a detachment of the Brass Bands, went out to meet them and escort them into the city. They met the companies at the foot of the Little Mountain. Elder Daniel D. McArthur, the Second; and after the meeting and salutations were over, amid feelings which no one can describe, the escort was formed, a party of Lancers leading the advance, followed by the Bands, the Presidency, the Marshal, and Citizens; then came the companies of Hand Carts, another party of Lancers bringing up the rear.  Bishop L. W. Hardy and myself fell in with the escort as they entered the city, and I must say my feelings were inexpressible: to behold a company-  of men, women and children, many of them aged and infirm, enter the city of the Great Salt Lake, drawing 100 ENDENTRY Historian's Office, G. S. L. City November 4th 1856  Dear Brother O. Pratt  Although it is the 4th of November the Eastern mail has not arrived, and thinking the California mail would be safer than the Eastern, under McGraw and Co. we write you by it.  On the 4th ult. Elders Joseph A. Young, Daniel Spencer, N. H.  Felt, J. D. T. McAllister, and C. G. Webb, arrived all in good health.  The October Conference was numerously attended, it is estimated that at least 12 thousand persons assembled in the Bowery, and were addressed by most of the returned missionaries, with much spirit and energy.  Capt Cherokee nation arrived on the 11th ult:  On the 13th ult. The First Presidency with a small company started East to meet the emigration, but while on Young was taken so severly ill  that the company was obliged to return.  On the 25th ult. The Rev C. R.

Woodruff ENDENTRY attention by us, we think it will be a benefit to this Territory.  The Saints in the various wards in the city have been rebap- tized; the example was set them by the first Presidency: the fruits of the Reformation has been made manifest throughout this Territory in many things, among which is a great increase in Tithing grain, which will help to bread the brethren who work at the Temple.  There will be a company of Missionaries start for Europe after conference, and some to the islands. Many have received their ordinances and blessings in the house of the Lord this Spring; some of the brethren from Iron County and many from the country Settlements.  The Board of Directors of the D. A. and M. Society have again published their lists of Premiums, amounting to over $1000 besides silver, medals, and Diplomas, for the encouragement of home man- ufactures, and the production of articles from the native elements.  The attention of many in this city and territory has been called to the importance of the Sheep raising, and as we have so limited a supply in this Territory, companies are forming to send to the States for larger supplies; realizing that as a community we can never attain to that commercial independence necessary to our prosperity and welfare, until we can grow our own wool and cotton and supply the market with home manufactured cloth. I think we have a fair  supply of bread to sustain the inhabitants until another harvest.  It is a general time of health and peace throughout this Territory all is peace with the Indians, Kanosh, and many of the chiefs are becoming quite civilized, and using a good influence with their Tribes to promote peace, civilization and industry, in the cultivation of the earth. Arrowpeene made a speech in the tabernacle a short time since to a large assembly, and all of his teaching, council, and instruction ENDENTRY There are many stone cutters now at work upon the Temple block, and after conference there will be a large addition: it is sweet music to hear the sound of the hammer and  chisel in the hands of so many men. we expect to push the work of the temple this season.  We have every prospect of a very fruitful season. Peaches, apples, Plums, apricots and currants are all loaded with fruit buds, and some nearly ready to bloom. we have also a fair  prospect for Grain as far as we can judge.  The past has been a very interesting Winter in Utah to the Latter day Saints, the inhabitants almost universally have assembled themselves together in their towns, cities, wards, settle- ments branches and quorums, and spent their Sabbaths and winter evenings in preaching, teaching, prayer and praise unto the Lord; and much of the Holy Spirit has been enjoyed in all the assemblies of the Saints, in every capacity in which they have met and such a thing as a Ball or party for recreation has hardly been heard of throughout the Territory. The power of God has rested upon the Presidency, the Twelve, and the Elders of Israel and they have been inspired to impart a  great amount of teaching, counsel and knowledge unto the people, and the fruits of the spirit of God has been visibly  manifested among the people; and they have greatly rejoiced  in the Lord. I have attended a meeting of some kind almost every night through the Winter months.  The Presidency with many others are preparing to make a trip to Salmon river settlement this Spring visiting the Northern branches as they go.

Editor of the Luminary  Dear Sir, The people throughout this Territory are enjoying good health so far as we can learn: there have been a few cases of small pox on Big Cottonwood, but nothing serious.  On the morning of the 31st ult. last month a fire broke out in the Public Blacksmith's shop, but was extinguished without  doing much damage.  On the 10th inst. we moved into our new office, opposite the Governor's offices; it is a very pleasant location, and the building is much more suitably adapted for the purpose of compiling history than the one we have previously occupied  Elders Bernard Snow, George Gates, and a number of other missionaries for the States and Europe left on the same day.

Your ordinations, offices, by whom, short synopsis of your missions, with the number baptized, your marriages and children andc up to Augt. 8, 1844. We have an account of all the family but you, and shall be pleased to have yours by return of mail.  All is well in Zion.  your truly, W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Ellsworth, who assisted in drawing the first hand cart,) with which they had travelled some 1400 miles in 9 weeks, and to see them dance with joy as they travelled through the Streets, complaining of nothing, only that they had been detained by the ox teams that carried some of their provisions, as they had to wait for them several hours each day, the oxen not being able to keep up with them: they say if it had not been for  these teams they would have been in ten days sooner. This sight filled our hearts with joy, and thanksgiving to God: Yes our hearts swelled until we were speechless with joy, and not with  sorrow. As I gazed upon the scene, meditating upon the future result, it looked to me like the first hoisting of the flood gates of deliverance to the oppressed millions; we can now say to the poor, and honest in heart, Come home to Zion; for the way is prepared. As the companies entered the city, and passed on to the public square, the Streets were thronged with thousands of people gazing upon the scene, which looked more like the dream of a night vision than a reality. They pitched their tents upon the Public Square. President Young called upon the Bishops and people to carry them food while they remained there; in a short time we could see loads of provisions going to their encampment. There has never been a company enter these vallies that has had the honor and respect paid to them that the Hand cart companies have; and Elders Ellsworth and McArthur have gained honor and glory In leading these brave companies: they have walked all the way, and assisted in drawing the hand carts to Zion, and ENDENTRY of hand carts, bringing bad news. Through starting so late in the Season, many of them have died; when the messengers arrived at this camp twenty had died—nineteen of them men; and when they left fifty had died. In order  to put a stop to so late starting another year, The Presidency talk of establishing posts along the road, for the storage of  provisions andc, viz: at Deer Creek, and Devil's Gate.  Altogether about 26,668 lbs of flour, 250 teams, and  great quantities of clothing have been sent out to meet the immigration, and assist them in.  The spirit of reformation is still cutting its way through the different settlements in these vallies; the saints are begin- ning to wake up to a sense of their duties, and the responsibilites they owe to their God. The Presidency are actively engaged  in the field, and wield the the arrows of the Almighty with a force and precision that carry conviction to every heart, and causes the miners in Zion to tremble, and fearfulness to surprise the hippocrite. The returned missionaries have been appointed "Home Missionaries," and they also have entered their field of labor, which at present is mostly confined to Great Salt Lake City, and are doing much good.  Yours truly W Woodruff ENDENTRY earnestly remembered in our prayers.  As far as the History is concerned, we finished matters up to the death of Joseph as far as we could; then brought up the other  matters including the history of the Twelve up to the organization of the church Augt. 8. I then have taken up the history of Brigham Young and his fathers family briefly, and now am at work on the history of the Twelve from their first organization in a brief form taking all that belonged to it up to the 8 August 1844. We have no trouble now with the Gentiles here in court or anywhere else. It would amuse you to read one of the late scenes while in court filled in our office—too lengthy to insert—with Dr. Burr and  some smaller fry, to bullying all our land and their defenders, a part of them came armed with Colts revolvers, it ended in I. S.  Williams resignation and Gen. Burr's dismissal from the Bar and some others who intended to use the pistols went out of the house in the form of a sled using the seat of their honor for run- ners, dropping their loaded weapons while going out, which they  never afterwards found. all has been quiet since, having but little  lawing on hand.  Please not expose my succatash letter to the press for I write for your own benefit and amusement, not guarded as I would  while writing to men who publish papers.  Gen. Burr has written to the department as we are informed, accusing us of cutting off and wasting the government timber in the Kanyons. I expect he will have an invitation this Spring of going to the upper mill in big cottonwood kanyon, and taking  a ride down to Jordan on the top of a big pine log, (if he can stay on the top of it) and when he has finished his trip, if he thinks it will not cut all it is worth to get it, we will pay to Government all that is over, leaving him to be the judge. yours truly W.

He is a very sensible man, and preaches sound doctrine, which is the case with Kanosh the Pauvan Pahvant chief, who is learning his tribe to raise their own bread. There are no Indians in North America who have been so wisely dealt with, kindly treated as well as fed, and clothed according to the resources at command, or that are in as propserous a condition for civilization and industry, according to the circumstances in which they were found as those Indians which come under the supervision of Governor Territory of Utah. For the Indians of this Territory were unlike the Cherokees and many other Tribes, who had been connected with civilization and white men for half a century but when Governor Young found them 10 years ago, they had but few of them even seen the face of a white man: but were sunk to the lowest degree of degradation and misery, that human beings were capable of existing under, but the wise and humane policy of Gov. Young has fed, clothed and exalted those degraded beings in the scale of intelligence, industry and civilization, and bettered their condition in regard to the world in a manner which has been unequalled in our day.

It is a valuable acquisition to our choir.  Elder Geo. A.

At 9 A.M. of the 26th Presidents Kimball, with the Brass Band, a attachment of the Lancers, and a very large number of the citizens started to meet the 1st and 2nd Edmund  Elsworth, and Daniel D. McArthur.  They travelled to the foot of the little mountain, where they met the companies and escorted them into the City, where they arrived about 5 1/2 P.M. The feelings of the brethren when they met them cannot be described; their hearts overflowed with gratitude to their heavenly Father that the lives of those faith- ful brethren and sisters had been preserved throughout their toilsome journey. There has been less sickness and death in these companies, than in any ^other^ company that ever crossed the plains, there being only 7 deaths out of 486 souls. The only complaints we have heard them make is that they were detained by a few ox teams in their company; if it had not been for these, they say they would have been in some few days sooner, as they had to wait several hours daily, for these teams to reach their camp.  By these companies Elders Edmund Ellsworth, Daniel D. McAthur, Spicer W. Crandall, returned missionaries arrived.  Great preparations are making for the Deseret State Fair ENDENTRY Historian's office G. S. L. City June 1 1857  Ed. of Mill. Star  Dr Sir,  The past month has been one of unusual peace and  quietness in this city; the monotony of which has been relieved by the  arrival of Gov. Young and Company on the 26th and the Eastern  may mail on the 29th, by which we are happy to announce the  safe arrival of Elders T. O. Angel.  The weather was cold during the fore part of last month  with occasional showers which mostly fell on the mountains around the valley. The frost on the morning of May 9th killed the Beans,  Potatoe vines, and injured the fruit blosoms: the weather for the  latter part of May has been very warm and dry.  Crops are promising throughout the Territory.  Water is abundant in the streams, the water sects in the  city are overflowing, and the waste water race in North Temple street  carries of much surplus water.  The health of the inhabitants of the Territory is excellent;  and since the opening spring has washed away with the tide of  emigration many of the half hearted Saints; the moral elements   feel considerably clearer.  Prest. Young gave a short sketch of his late tour on  the stand yesterday, said he had heard much concerning the country Northward; but all he had heard had failed to impress his mind  with a correct idea of the sterrility, barrenness, mountainous and broken  condition of the country: the company travelled 762 miles in 1 month and 2 days, had a laborious journey, which however was rendered  agreeable by the unanimity, harmony and good feelings manifested.  ENDENTRY they have healed the sick, and strengthened the weak, by night and by day, and when those worthy elders entered the City, they remained at the head of their companies covered with dust, drawing a hand cart like the rest of their bretheren. Elder Ellsworth, while passing his own house, and seeing his wives and children standing in the door did not stop to speak to them, but only saluted them while passing, and remained  with his company until they were encamped and fed.  There were but seven deaths in Elder Ellsworth's company, and less in McArthur's, during the whole journey, although many were aged, and feeble; women and children have drawn hand carts all the way. No oxen that could be put upon the road could keep up with them.  President Young has been sanguine from the beginning, that it was a safe and practical enterprize, and it has now been proven to be so; and I feel that we can say to the saints in all the world, Let your hearts be comforted, have faith  and trust in God, call upon him in mighty prayer, be faithful, and follow the counsel of the servants of God, and lay up all that you can to help you over the sea, and your deliverance is nigh, even at the door.  The Presidency of the Church have commenced a  great reformation among this people in the vallies of the  mountains.

The teachings of the First Presidency were rich indeed— pointing out the onward course of Israel, and urging upon the  Saints to lay up grain against the days of famine.  There were 11 missionaries appointed to the U. S., 13 to the  California.  One very interesting scene transpired at the close of the  conference: the sons of the Prophets and apostles were called up  on the stand, and to speak before the assembled people. Their words were few but generally well ordered. Amongst the number were Joseph A. and Orson Pratt Jr., and Heber John Richards  In some wards in the city most of the young men have  been ordained and set to work in the Priesthood as Teachers and Deacons.

The forenoon from 8 to 12 was nearly all taken up in  hearing the loathsome hash which the corrupt press of the U. S. has  given birth to. It was indeed novel however to hear the Governor  propose such articles to be read; seeing; they were mostly aimed at his  private and public character; but this only shows the consciousness he  possesses of the rectitude of the path which he pursues, and the confidence  he has in the people whom he leads.

The past conference was very interesting. The teachings of the  First Presidency were appropriate and seasonable: 33 missionaries were  sent to Sandwich Isles, 11 to the  U. S., and 2 to California.  A great many have been called to go on the road between  here and the States; some to make settlements, others to engage  in the service of the Express and carrying coy.  Quite a number have left these vallies, and are returning  to the States, and others to California.  Since the arrival of bros McArthur last fall  with the hand cart companys, hand carts have become popular; inso- much that the Missionaries for Europe Canada and the States have  substituted the hand carts, and are now travelling en route for the  states by that method of conveyance: 23rd. Ulto. was the day  appointed for their starting, which created an unparralleled excite- ment in the starting of Missionaries from these vallies. Appropriate  addresses were delivered by Elders L. Snow and others:  ENDENTRY remission of their sins.  President Grant has gone into the North counties, and is preaching and baptizing whole wards, and building up Churches. I presume the same course will be pursued in the wards in this city. The people begin to feel more than ever that they are dealing with the spirit and power of God, and the Holy Priesthood. Yes the Latter Day Saints begin to feel that they are dealing with a spirit that can  reach the hearts, know the thoughts and intents thereof, and try the souls of men. The people are called to sanctify themselves before the Lord, that we may be prepared for the work of our God.  Elder P. P. Pratt, in company with the Eastern Missionaries Started on the 10th inst.

We are having a favorable fall for all kinds of labor, except it is dry—we need rain.  Oure early frosts damaged late corn very much. Some are sowing their fall wheat.

Prests. H. C. Kimball with a detachment of Lancers,  the Brass band, and many citizens went up into the Kanyon to meet the companies.  The feelings which the Brethren had on meeting them I will not attempt to pourtray, to behold a company of men women and children amounting to nearly 500 souls, drawing 486 100 hand carts, entering into the city of Great Salt Lake, dancing with joy as they passed along, only complaining that they had been encumbered with a few ox teams for which they had to wait several hours almost daily, otherwise they would have been with us ten days sooner, and then to realize that this company had walked some 1400 miles, drawing their hand carts the whole distance; these things presented to our eyes, at the same time reflecting upon the future results— filled our hearts with joy unspeakable, and caused our bosoms to swell  with thanksgiving to God. we felt that the flood gate of deliverance was hoisted to the oppressed millions, and we could say in confidence to the poor and honest in heart "come home to Zion," for the way is opened up. Prest. Kimball said his heart felt as big as a two bushel basket, yes our hearts were so swollen that we were speechless not with sorrow, but with joy. Elders Ellsworth and McArthur have earned honor and glory to themselves in the leading of these companies   ENDENTRY otherwise pleasant journey: remained with the settlement at Salmon  river 4 days where the brethren have made much improvement, and  have sown 120 Bushels of seed Wheat this spring.

City May 5 1857  Ed. of Western Standard  Dear Sir,  The California Mail arrived on the 2nd inst., bringing files of the Standard, which as usual is very interesting.  During the 6, 7, 8 and 9 days of the past month we held our 27th annual conference, which has been a very interesting and important oc- casion. There were 33 Missionaries appointed to Canada  13 to the Sandwich isles, 11 to the U. S., and 2 to Calafornia.  We were favored with rich teachings from the First Presidency.  The objects and interests of the Express and Carrying Company were  laid before the people; showing the advantages that would accrue to  gathering Israel when a high way was cast up, settlements made  at every feasable point, and a thoroughfare established so that the  Saints could come home. The necessity of laying up grain against  the days of famine and want was urged upon the Saints.  Thirty four brethren were selected this spring to make a settle- ment on the Rio Virgin for raising cotton; and over one hundred  have been called to make settlements between here and the States,  and to engage in the Express Coy.  Judge T. S. Williams and many others are leaving this  spring for the States, not being able to find out here, whether mormon- ism is true or not.  The weather for the past month has been very dry, still  crops are looking well; Dews are becoming more prevalent in this country.  april 23rd—The missionaries for Europe, Canada and the  States started with hand carts, as another ensample to the Saints scat- tered abroad of the feasibility of that method of gathering: there was  ENDENTRY Historian's office G. S. L. City Nov 5, 1856  Ed. of the Western Standard  Dear Brother The Weather has been very cold and some- what stormy for the past month, but at the present more open and mild.  On the arrival of Elders F. D. Richards and company at this place, Prest. Young learned the exact situation of the Emigration, at the dates the brethren passed the several camps; and although much help in Teams and Flour had been sent out early in the season, the President made it the first item of business before the conference to raise Flour, Teams, Wagons, Teamsters, Blankets and clothing to send to them: to this call there was a very liberal response. Subsequent calls have been made, and it is now believed there has in the neighborhood of 250 Teams gone out, and at the conference call alone there was 26,688 lbs of flour sent, so you perceive this seasons emigration comes tolerably heavy on those of our brethren who are always on hand to help Israel.  The best news from this place is the reformation which is abroad in the Territory. you may consider that reformation is no new thing in Israel, that as a people we have always been reforming  or trying to do so; but let me assure you that reformation has began in solemn earnest. The humble and faithful are waking up, repenting of their sins, making restitution where they have wronged, and preparing for the waters of baptism determined from henceforth in the strength of Israels God to serve him, and keep his command ments. The reformation is the all absorbing topic here to those who want to do right, and as a matter of course the greatest thorn to those who do not, that has yet troubled them in Israel. ENDENTRY G. S.

Ulto.; having wintered in the snow at Devils gate: it brought me your note of Oct. 18th. I have not heard from any mail since the 1st. of Nov. When the mail of the winter months arrive I shall expect to receive the fruit cuttings sent for, which I am  anxiously looking for. I have requested Hon. J. M. Bernhisel to  forward you $5. for a few of the Dioscorea Batatas as a trial; if you obtain the order please send them to my address. I would like to obtain a genuine article of Hovey seedling strawberries accompanied with a suitable staminate.  Your letter having been detained until so late a date I have but a few seeds of any kind on hand which will be of value to you I enclose a few seeds of the Mesquite and Muskroo from the Rio Virgin and Santa Clara. the coarse seeds are Mesquite, the fine Muskroo, it forms an ornamental tree some 20 feet high. I could not give information whether the proper time of sowing should be Spring or Fall. I also enclose a few service berries where the bush is calculated it produces two crops each season.  During the summer I will dry carefully some of our best mountain currants of each kind and service berry and forward to you, or any other native seeds which I think may be of any worth to you. some of our native currants bear a remarkable good berry both for size and flavor as large as the English black cherry. I am satisfied that Utah will prove a good fruit growing country. Aprictots and Peaches ENDENTRY they have like the people walked all the way and assisted in  drawing the hand carts. Brother city covered with dust at the head of his brave company drawing a hand cart, under the close scrutiny of the thousands who crowded the streets with weeping eyes to gaze upon the scene; as he passed by his own lovely home and saw his wives and children standing in his door he made no halt, only gave a passing salute, continuing with his company until he reached the public square and saw them all comfortably encamped  and fed. I felt that his position was far more honorable and lovely in the eyes of God and Angels and good men, than it would have been had he been mounted upon the best steed that ever had the earth clothed with ermine and gold. Prest. Young has declared from the beginning that it was a practical safe operation his sayings in this, as in all other cases have proven here, he lost but seven out of his company a smaller number than almost any company that have arrived here containing as many souls. Many were aged and infirm, yet they out-travelled any ox teams that could be started on the road; never has a company been so highly honored, so numerously worked, or so kindly dealt with since Israel has arrived in these mountains, as the Pioneer hand cart companies.  The Deseret State Fair is opened for the reception of articles for exhibition, and from the universal spirit of encouragement to domestic manufactures, we anticipate our Fair will be an emporium of Utah's true wealth which will astonish her own citizens, further particulars by next mail.  There is a reformation commenced here among this people by the authorities of the church, such an one as we trust will be ENDENTRY quite an excitement in the city on the occasion: large crowds of citizens assembled to see them start: Elders L.

The Sabbath school children had a may day walk on the  1st inst.—promenaded through the streets, and at 4 p.m. met in  the Tabernacle, where there parents were also invited. I had the  pleasure of delivering them an address, and felt the occasion and felt it  was one of no ordinary character,  I understand the address appears in  the News.

ENDENTRY On the 31st October, brother Horace Newell arrived from Elder Willie's hand cart Coy., whom they left on the sweetwater, when the teams sent out at Conference arrived at this camp, there had been twenty deaths, nineteen of them men. and while with them in one day there were fifteen burials, and when the messengers left there had been fifty deaths. They did not seem to be sick, but chilled through, men would dig graves for their brethren, and before night would die themselves. They had distributed  their last rations of Flour the night before the brethren met them and they did not know that any relief was at hand.  The reason of this difficulty and suffering ink faded with the emigration is in consequence of the companies starting so late, and  the early falling of snow in the mountains. Prest. Young has universally given counsel for the emigration to start early.  The hand cart companies who started early came in well indeed better than the most sanguine could have expected.  yours truly. W. Woodruff ENDENTRY permanent. The preaching of the First Presidency has been soul tirring indeed. We may safely say in a measure that such sermons were never heard before, as have been delivered unto us of late by the prophet of God, and they are weighing the people, and the people feel that they are dealing with the quickening spirit and power of God which discerns and knows their hearts and they feel the importance of repentance and baptism for the remission of sins and leading holy lives before God that we may be prepared for the events which await the whole earth. In some of the settlements in Davis County every one has gone forward and been re-baptized, and we anticipate the same results will follow in G. S. L. County.  Sep 20. Elder Peterson's company of Danes arrived.  Elder S. M. Blair and company returned from exploring a route to E. Reese arrived from Carson with the same report.

Ult we had a general muster and inspection of the Wells and his staff received the troops, after which a hollow square was formed and the Lieut. Gen.  delivered an animating address to the troops, which was well sustained by the officers of his staff and chaplain.  We have had much excellent preaching lately by the First Presidency and others. Prest. Young has come out boldly and told this people in the name of the Lord, they must repent and be baptized for the remission of their sins. Several Wards have gone forward en masse been baptized and recieved their covenants before the Lord, and I believe the fire of a universal reformation in this Territory has been lit and will continue to burn, until a permanent foundation for good works has been laid in our midst. We must  say since the organization of this church our ears have never been saluted with more pointed Godlike sermons, than have flowed lately from Prest. Young and his counsellors.
