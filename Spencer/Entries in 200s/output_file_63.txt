 St George 1st Jan 1893    Elder Jos D C Young  Temple Block  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother    Yours of the 28th ult. In regard to chairs  for seating, Creation, Garden, Telestial and Terrestrial   Rooms in Salt Lake Temple; and suggestions in   relation to Font asked for, came to hand yes-  terday. ^There are no objections stated I know of in using the seats referred to^ I think the iron chair will do very well  for the creation room. [redacted text]    In regard to the Font, the one in Manti Temple is   the style you expect to follow. Very good, but should not be so [depursed]  as to expose the person being baptized to the gaze of spectators on the side, in at event of clothing  becoming disarranged [illegible] of having water    I would suggest the seats for Witnesses as well as Recorder  and Confirmers, ^be so arranged that all can see as well as hear the [ceremony]^ As no steps were cast in the three present temples by which to   ascend into the confirmation chair I would suggest that this be done after [wiring of] ^The steps for this purpose may be [a creation]^   [aton] of those leading out of the front at west end.    Enclosed please to find what are consider  practicable.    The place for desk [here] given for the Recorder  you will perceive puts him in the most [available]   position to perform the Duty enjoined upon him in the Doctrin and  Covenants

 dence I would have if I could point to  the source of my Power, this sounds like  egotism but truly & sincerly I beg you not  to read it so, For I do not feel that way,  but as an humble servant who longs  to know his master; as one who feels  his power incomplete just for that  reason, there has been no noise made  about this, because when people have asked  me what it was, I feel almost like a thief  & have answered lightly, or as tho it was  nothing & felt ashamed because I could  not point to my God & say it is him,  & then I have tried one case of parali  sis & running sores & in which I have  failed partialy atleast & I could not  help but feel as tho it was my fault or  as if I had not done my best for I do hope  that I would be able to cure them if I can    [upside down text] there are many others but this will serve  now.

 souls into the Church than any one man in the Church; I do not know how  that is. I brought two thousand into the Church in the south of England-  in Herefordshire, &c., in 1840; but I never felt to boast or to take any  credit to myself in any of these things, for it was God not Wilford  Woodruff that did it. Yet I felt it was a great blessing to be an  instrument in the hands of God of performing siuch a work. So I look upon  you young brethren who are sent now to the nations of the earth to preach  the gospel and save the souls of men. No greater or more glorious work  could you be called to. Therefore, my dear brother, take hold with all  your might. Call upon the Lord in mighty prayer for the Holy Ghost to  be with you to give you power to preach the Gospel and give you souls in  search of your ministry, and the Lord will hear your prayers and give  you power to accomplish a good mission which will be a satisfaction to   yourself and your friends and acceptable unto God who has called you.  And this applies not only to yourself, but to every Elder with you, and  all who are in the vineyard of the Lord. Therefore, fear not, but labor  faithfully to prune the vineyard once more for the last time and prepare  the earth for the coming of the Son of Man. Avoid all evil, resist all  temptations, and the angels of God will be your constant companions.    Give my love and blessing to Prest. Naegle and wife and all the  Elders with you. I am interested in the welfare of every Elder laboring  in the vineyard of the Lord.    Spencer Clawson's wife died last week and will be buried on  Sunday. I would be glad to hear from you and know how you are getting  along. Sister Woodruff, Blanch and Alice join me in love to you and Bro.  and Sister Naegle.    From your Brother in the Gospel,  Wilford Woodruff

But you will see from  the following that I could not  very well do otherwise but come  to you.

I have had  people offer me money for curing them,  but I have alway's refused to charge for I  would feel as selling something that does  not belong to me if I did. Now I beg of you  to not delay or pass this bye, but let me  know what I ought to do, & lest you should  think I am exagerating, or misrepresenting  thing's I pray you to write to either of  the following men in this place for a  statement or an affidavit Arthur  Knapp, He is a druggist, & had the  Rheumatism three years so he could not  walk with out crutch or cane was well  in less than three minutes after I put  my hand on him.

 Please excuse this brown sheet   it was taken on account of its  size & plainer ruling â€”    Burlington Iowa March 20th 1849    Wilford & Phebe Woodruff    Dear friends Almost two years having elapsed since I   left you & the City of Saints & not having recieved one word from you as yet I   feel inclin'd to address a few lines to you as I have been won't to do in former days  but how unlike are my feelings on this occasion to what they formerly were when   addressing you by my pen I say  unlike â€” & why should they not be â€” seperated from   my Companion & Partner in life with whom I have lived & shared the Joys &  sorrows attendant upon forty years by nearly two thousand Miles & without any   means of obtaining a knowlege of his situation as to body or mind or rather,  whether he is comfortable as to body comfortable contended & satisfied in mind   or not, & besides this a recollection of the scenes which I have witnessed since I   left my home in the East to Travel & mingle with the Saints of the last   Days or rather the recollections of many things which transpiered while I   was at the Bluffs or which were manifested towards me from time to time some   of which th'o small in their nature yet being attended with unfriendly, un-  charitable, & as I tho't, undue feelings towards me seems calculated in its  nature to obstruct those avenues from which flow the ready Ideas, the   sentiments of friendship & love & a full confidince of addressing   a congenial spirit yet I would not wish to be under stood by these   remarks that I indulge hard feelings towards you for I do not th'o   I thus speak I feel grateful & think I shall never foget the kind   attention I recieved from your hands while on our Journey from   the east as to the feelings which seemed to be most prevalent towards   me afterwards I impute in some degree to the mistaken Idea that   I was in favour of Mr Strangs claims but if this was in fact the case  I should think I had not improved much in the delusion if it be such for after   having been living with Son Webster & Eunice for nearly two years I have not yet   become a Strangite in principle or name. All the reasons I have given my friends   to think me wavering on this ground have been manifest in a want of a   disposition to oppose Eunice & her husband in their faith I felt it    my duty to give them a hearing as to the reasons they assign'd for pursuing  their present course & I must say that there were some things which app-  eared quite reasonable in relation to the subject still I did not get light   in mind on the subject sufficient to over ballance or vie with that which 
 & Germany; in Provo she was enticed  by the father of G. N., Bro. John C. Naegele  to Toquerville, Washington Co. Utah,  to come down with him in the  service of one of his wives; without  much experience, she did not insist  much on his conditions of payment,  thinking because she had got the  money for her emigration from the  brother-in-law of John C. Naegele,  Mr. John Beck from Salt Lake City,  that she was bound more or less to  go with him, though she did not  like very well to go so far south.  Now she went and was for about  40 weeks at Mrs. Naegele's in Toquer-  ville, viz till April 1887; Mr John C.  Naegele never paid her any wages,  except a pair of shoes of $1.50, wollen  cloth for a suit of perhaps 3 or 4 dolls,  a piece of lady under clothing worth  80 c. or $1.00 and $10.00 for her journey

 back to Payson. Miss M Hofmann  had to force her way out of Mr. John  C. Naegele, viz. insist frequently and  strongly till he would allow her  to go out of his home, for he never  took her down with him but thin-  king she would become his wife, as  many of his utterances did show it.  Miss Hofmann never thought of such  thing and finally got out through  her firmness. In the month of October  1887 she became my wife at Logan,  and, as she was still owning for  her emigration, I wrote immediately  to Mr. John C. Naegele, to have to  pay me for her the sum of $120.00  or $3 per week for the 40 weeks she  was in his wife's home, Mrs. Rosalie  Zahler N., writing at the same  time to Pres. McAllister of the St. George  Stake (I join his answer to my letter).  I did ask $3 per week because Miss 
 had established me in my then present faith neither have I since that time felt   any obstrutction in my mind on account of this Doctrine excepting my anxiety to have   my children see with me on this subject. I exspect however that some, if not many   of the Brethren in Burlington some of which may have gone to the Bluffs have   entertained the Idea that I had become a believer in Mr Strang as being call'd to lead   the church from the fact that my daughter & her husband were of this faith & withal   that I had not formed much acquaintce with them having been confin'd at home for   the most past on account of sickness in the family & I think it not at all unlikely that   such a report has reached the Bluffs long eer this, But I will digress, I wrote to   Azmon soon after I arrived here & informed him of my leaving his Father at the Bluffs  & coming to Burlington to make a years visit at Son Webster's exspecting to return the next   spring &c, he replied in due season, & congratulated me on my escape from the savage   hordes of the western wilds & warned me in the name of Israels god not to think of   ever returning there again & that if I did so, I would do it at my peril, at the expense  of bodily comforts if not of life itself he sent me fifteen Dollars & said if I would act   wisely & stay where I was he would assist me from time to time, he requested me to write   to his father & to tell him that he wanted him to return & come to Richland & tho't if he   would set himself to work & use every effort in his power ^tho't^ that he would be able to acco-  mplish the journey & when he should find himself at Br Websters he would then  feel that he could with safety send on help to bring him & Mother to Richland   he then adds "if you should ever find yourselfs in the society of your children   at Richland I know" (I don't guess) you will never wish to leave for the R. M.  he said, he felt, that he could not with any safety send on Money beyound where  I now was to assist his Parents on their Journey to California or if he could do so,   it appreared to him that it would be much like assisting a Man with but one  arm who someway wanted to contrive to put a rope around his neck to hang   himself with, he concluded his remarks by saying that if his Father would   not return there was no law either of God or Man that would condemn me  for not returning to dwell with him, he gave me a very handsome invitation   to come & make it my home with him, sassuring me that I should never want   for any of the comforts of life so long as he had any thing or was able to labour   he has written me four or five times a year ago the past winter he lost his Daughter  Elisabeth which was a great trial to them. Thus you will perceive the inducements  I have had to make up my mind not to return to the Camp for the present yet I do   discard the Idea of being influenced by my friends any farther than my own better  Judgment & belief dictated to be right, & consequently for the best. I have enjoyed   myself very well since I have been at Burlington Son Webster is doing well has

I desire to  respond to any call made upon  me to assist in carrying on the  work of the Lord, and cheerfully  accept the call to fill a mission  to the Southern States.

 Hofmann was a good dress-maker,  and would at any time have made  that much or more besides her  board either in Washinton Co or  in Provo, or Payson or Salt Lake C[it]y  where she subsequently was; and  because she had to make many dres-  ses for N's folks and besides work  hard, harder than many young man  would splitting wood, cutting grass,  etc all the time, as many people  of Toquerville could certify. N's people  answered me, that he was not at  home; afterwards I wrote to his  Bishop who answered me that  he (N.) would not pay anything  (his answer lies by).    Now my request, dear Brother,  is this, that if it is not too  much of you, please tell me what  I shall do. You see that neither  his Bishop or Pres. McAllister seem 
 Boston Sept 25th 1848    Brother Brannan    Dear Sir    As their is a ship about to  sail from New York: to carry the mail to Calafornia  I feel a disposition to improve it by droping a few lines to  you to give you even a synopsis of evry thing transpired with me  since I saw you & of the news of the county on a sheet of paper  would require more still then I possess yet I will say a few things  We stayed in the valley about one month, put for home, met 600  waggons of Saints about the NMountain pass going on, while spending  the last night with the last company the Indians stole 49 Horses  from us, 8 days after made an attack upon us in open day for more  but ownly got one. We lived mostly on Buffalo Meat going Home  without Bread Arived at Winter Quarters the fore part of Nov, found  our families generally well. And we all spent a good Winter had  good meetings & councils & the Lord was with us, not a quarter  as much sickness as the year before the folks all busy during  the winter & spring getting ready to go either to the East or West  After I got ready with the rest to go to the West, it Was decided  that I should go to the Eastern States & preside ofover that part, and  Canidas, New Brunswick Nova scotia &c And O Pratt go to England  to preside over the British Isles. So I changed abot & set my face  for the East instead the West I waited However to see the spring caps  camps start for the vally. I was ^with^ Brs Young & Kimball at the Home to  see them start with their first company of 600 waggons. they made  a grand looking Encampment they were fitted out with provisions one year &  a half they left about 25 May. W Richards & A Lyman left abot the 25th  of June with another company of over 300 waggon their were near 1000  waggons in all of the saints went this spring.

 36 Chapel Street Liverpool April 22nd 1844    Dear Sister Sangiovanniah,    I have long Desired to see you &   have some conversation with you concerning the cause of God  in which you are engaged. I have not forgotten the acquainted  I had with you in London & as I expect to be in that  city again in the course of a few weeks I hope I may  be favored with an interview with you again. I rejoice that  you continue firm in the faith. When I left Nauvoo I   saw Br Kimball he sent a letter by me to you which he wished  me to deliver to you in person, but I will put it with this  in the hands of Elder Davis  he says they will go safe to you  so I will forward them, I saw your Brother in New Bedford he sent a  letter, by me to you which I forwarded to you on my arival  which I hope you got. Many things have transpired since I last  saw you in the progress of the kingdom of God of much interest  & some scenes of sorrow the death of Joseph & Hiram was much  lamented but the power of God has increased in the church since  Joseph had more of the power of God with him during the last  7 months esspecially in the Endowment of the Twelve than ever  before, he was aware he was going to be slain, the work was  never in as propserous a situation in America as at the prest  time. Nauvoo is building up fast, the Temple will be finished  this fall it is expected, & the endowment commenced. I saw

 steady employ at his Trade getting a good living &c, but as I have remarked in the   first part of this sheet a reccollection of the past seems to cast a dark shade   both over the scene & ^my own^ mind for I must say that I have been next to being confounded   as it regards many things relating to my Journeying West. I set out with a full conf-  idence that it was according to the will of God I also felt full confidence in the good   feelings of my family friends towards me honestly supposing that I should enjoy   all that confidence, good will, & friendship from my relatives that I had been   accustomed to from all my particular acquaintances & it is a fact that   however unworthy I may have been to recieve the attention, good will &  respect of my neighbours & friends heretofore, I have notwithstanding en-  joyed a good degree of the Same & have invariably fared the best where I have   been most acquainted, & I have had some intimations of the respect which   I have formerly had paid to me since I have been at Burlington, Mrs Stare & her   Sister Daughters of Mr James The Camp of Farmington have paid all that atte-  ntion ^to^ me since I have been here that could even have been asked by a person of  high rank, Mr Stare has a splended house which he build in connection with   Govenor Clark they live in sight of us. Mrs Stare & Susan have called upon us a   number of times they called soon after I came & Mrs S. gave me a very pressing   invitation to come & spend a day with them ^&^ to take off any Idea of its being   a mere compliment she adds It would seem so good to have a visit with you   I have visited them twice & spent the Day in the most agreeable manner I felt my   self perfectly at home in their society or as with home friends alth'o they are acc-  ounted as some of the most Proud & high feeling Ladies that Burlington offer'd  Indeed they live in high stile I have also had Letters from Pennett Redman &  I can assure you, they give evidence of having been written in the Spirit of the   highest degree of friendship she speaks of my "most precious Letter" (as she terms  it) & speaks of the numberless times as it were she calld at the office  before she read one from me & that the days seemed to her like weeks  so great was her anxiety to hear from me she wished me to write her as  often as possible & she would pay the Postage both ways, & remarked that Pennetts  Letters contained the most news & were the most interesting of (almost) any she had ever perused  But it is not my wish or design to boast of friends or of any particular attention paid me  by distinguished persons, my object is simply to contrast the general feelings of former  Day friends towards me with those which have been manifested towards me by   relatives & those under their special influence since I came west. But I do not presume to   complain of my living while with you as to provisions &c, for if ^I^ had felt no greater trials than what I exs-  perienced from the privations I suffered they would have been small setting aside from instances in   which a bad feeling was manifested towards me by yourself Son Wilford, whoever might have been the cause  of itâ€”once in particular when I took it upon me to go in the room & in behalf of your honored Father  to ask for somthing ^to^ eat as he felt backward about going & you hesitated about it saying every  thing fell upon you to do, &c, & when I replied that I did not know what we should do having nothing   at all to eat you said I know what you can do, you mustn't eat so muchâ€”did you concider that   your Parents had but one thing at a time to eat & that a great allowance aught to be made on this  account as well as for your having put one of your family join with us, as also, the amount   of the exspression made to me, but you will excuse the length of my remark as I had no   Idea of pat^r^iticularizing on this, I however feel constraind to state to you on this sheet some   things which th'o small in their nature have nevertheless lain with serious weight on   my mind (but as my sheet is already full with croocked marks & blots I must conclude   on another piece I should indeed copy this were not my time for writing so limited & it is for  this reason that this sheet contains so great a variety as to the writing having to improve my most   wearied moments in the penning of the same for which I trust you will make allowance 
 INDEPENDENCE  MO. April 29th. 1895.    President Wilford WOOdruff.  Salt Lake City.  Utah.    Dear Sir.    In a discourse delivered by you April 7th. [18]95. and pub-  lished in the Deseret News of the 23rd. ins't  You speak of the   great apostasy of the Church at Kirtland.  Will you please state the causes   that brought it about, and the date it took place.    What I want to know os is, was the contention caused by any point   of doctrine revealed by the Seer.  If so what doctrine did 'he advocate   that the people refused to accept.  As you were there I feel you can  give a correct account of all that transpired regarding this matter.  Awaiting your convenience I remain Very Respectfully.    Alfred Peterson.

I wish bro John-  son to be accomodated with what land they need to-  gether, for his family & friends wish to stay with him.  I also wish bro Tenny to ^assist bro Johnson to^ procure a suitable herd-  ground away from the settlement for his sheep, goats  & horse stock.

 to think much upon my request  to them. Is it right for any man  to hire somebody keep them as  long as possible and then let them  go without any renumeration worth  of the time they have been hired?  Mr. John C. Naegele is rich and can  pay very well. If he was not paying  there would be a very simple way,  we would not pay back the $60 or 65  that my wife owes for her emigra-  tion, for he could pay them back  to his brother-in-law; but this  would not be a right way, and  then there are still two sisters of   my wife in the old country, and  may be be one of them could be helped  if that money could be sent back,  for Mr. Beck is actually or was  at least lately in Germany and  would perhaps let one have it.

O Pratt sailed in July to England  was 18 days on the way the work is progressing like fire in a dry stubble  throughout that land. Thousands are coming into to the Church in  England, Wales, Scotland &c.

I have not seen your Mother for a length  of time but thy are well as far as I know. Nauvoo is  getting to be a great city & a strong one & thy are erecting  a most splendid Temple in that City.

 Fillmore Sept. 10, 1895.  Pres. Woodruff:    Dear Bro.    On June 5, 1893 I received notice  of a mission, but on account of  circumstances was released for  the time being to report when  ready.    I am now ready to fill a  mission.    If it is agreeable I would  prefer going to England as  my wife wishes me to visit her  relatives.    Other than this your choice  would be my choice.    I will be ready to go in October.  Anxiously waiting a reply.

 There seemed to be from time to time while at the Bluffs conciderable effort exerted to prove me  out guilty of something, or somewhat, or of some misdemeanour of conduct but after all I could   not find that there was any thing of a tangible nature or at least so much so as to be productive   of any evil whatever but not so with the things which I have to speak of for indeed some of them   were of weighty consequences for who can deny that a persons reputation & character is not   worth more to them than almost anything else of an earthly nature & now I must say   that I did while at the Bluffs recieve slighly treatment from some very respectable sisters   in the church for no other cause than having had an unfavorable account of my person   from those who should have been my friends as it was evident from the particular   attention & kind feelings which they manifested towards me for a time after our first   acquaintance with each other & then becoming so cool, reserved, & distant all at once as   tho they viewed me a different person from they had before & in one or two instances I   had evidences of its being through your instrumentality Phebe that I had this treat-  ment, once in particular you acquainted me with a sister, & before we got to our   Journeys end & she treated me very politely indeed but it was not long before I   saw you conversing with her not far from me & it was evident to ^my^ mind that I was the   topic of your conversation from the fact that you both alternately eyed me with a very curious   sort of look & in the conclusion this sister gave me a look exspressive of great disdain & al-  th'o she would seem in a measure friendly when I saw her yet never appeared as before this   occurance, & it is a fact that there were a number of some of the most respectable sisters from   whom I recieved a similar coldness of treatment after having been made the recipient of some   of the warmest exspressions of friendship from them, & now I wish to say that it is not my man-  ner to complain of any want of attention shown me by respectable persons or any others where I   have had a good acquaintance & no reasons for supposing their minds have been biassed  even should I be treated with disrespect in short I am ready in general to put up with that degre  of attention & respect which such persons account me as meriting from them but I can never   feel that the course pursued with me while at the Bluffs in regard to these things [[illegible is   according to godliness or agreeable to the ordinary rules of civility Indeed there were various   other things which were calculated in their nature to give one the worst of feelings especially   where there was a consciousness of not having deviated from the strictest rules of civility &   good behaviour in any othf their conduct as I can with safety say was the case with my-  self altho I do not lay claim to perfection in anything, stilI I do profess so much of it as to   be able to avoid any course of conduct which would merit those things to which I allude as  for instance Phebes remarking that she did not love Mother Woodruff & never could & that she did   not care whether she was comfortable or not, (as I was credibly informed by a friend) & in   another instance that, she said, she would give most anything if she could love me but enough   of this it makes my heart sick & tho I might perhaps make use of a similar exspression with as   much propriety yet I will only say that I have ever loved & respected Phebe since our first acquain-  tance & I do feel a confidence that I ever treated her while on our Journey with all that friendship &  good feeling which would be possible for anyone to do, under the same circumstances & I can give   no reason at all why I should not have enjoyed the good feelings & confidence of the more   respectable, as formerly while at the east except it were in those things I have named &   my being a stranger there. But I would like to communicate to you some of my present   feelings in relation to my returning & going on to the Valley as I exspected when I left,   as to my faith it is the same it ever has been & there has been nothing which has seem'd  to block up my way so much in regard to going forward as the fact, if my constitutions  having been so broken down by disease as to compel me to the making use of such article  of medicine daily in order to be in any measure comfortable which is attended with some   conciderable exspense & thinking that you might not feel yourself able to do this or   might not be willing to be at the exspense of the same for which reason I have been   influenced to accept the solicetations of my children thus far in my calculations to   make it home with them, but tho I should be extremely happy to make Azmon

In answer, I will say that I have   given the matter careful thought, and   have talked with the Bishoprick of   this place:  And we have decided   to ask you to please extend the time   until next April.

I am confident that I could do    better missionary work if I have my   home affairs in proper order

The present signs of the Times indicate war  between America & England on the Origon question  whether it will break out soon or not I do not know  if it should I shall probably leave for America   There appears also to be much excitement at the  present time in this country in consequence of the  Bill before parliment to Endow the Mynooth College  of the Roman. Elder Davis & myself attended a larg[e] [page torn]  meeting of the citizens of Liverpool upon that subject last  night to petition parliment to stop that petition the  excitement is very great upon that subject it appears to  be the beginning of the fulfillment of prophecy I can  see much meaning in these matters we are living in   a day big with events.

City  Dear Brother:â€”    I take the liberty of returning the inclosed  letters, as they seem to be contradictory   , and the last one would, convey the idea that   I had been "on a fools erand.

My reply to that was that I  would be on hand the following   October.  Accordingly I made  praparations to that end.  I put   my Sheep in somebody elses  charge and expected to go  , but I received no further notifi-  cation, hence I took back my   Sheep and thought perhaps I  would not be wanted for some time.

 Farmington Oct. 7th 1895.    President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Sir,  In reply to the call to go on  a mission to the Southern States,  I will say, that I feel my weakness  and unworthyness, for such an  important labor as preaching the  gospel to the inhabitants of the  earth. I feel like it was more than  I am capable of doing. But I  will say this, I am at your  service. I am willing to go  and do the best that I can.  By the help of God I hope to  fill a good honorable mission.  That is my greatest desire.    From your humble servant  in the everlasting covenant    Armond T. Rose  J M Secrist Bp    very good.  J.

 Diaz Chihuahua Mex.  Mar 2 [18]95.  Pres. Wilford Woodruff  S. L. City    Dear Brother    In reply to yours of the 13th of   Feb, I reply as follows. I am a believer in the   principals of the Church of Jesus Christ of   laterday saints, Willing and wishing to obey the   call made on me by the pr^i^estood of God, Yet at   the same time the notification was so long   on the road I had no chance to get ready.    The date on which I received your letter was   Feb 27th 7 P.M. only giving me 3 days to   prepare in as the other 7 days would be taken   up in traveling between here and S. L. City.   Which time would have bin all the time   I would have asked if my business had   bin in a shape to leave but it was not   as I had heard nothing about being calld   before I received the notification My finan-  cial affairs are in a mixed condition. For  instance I have took a contract to build a   house which is up to the square. I have sold  some land which has bin bought of a Mexican   there is some trouble about the deeds of said   land I have obligated myself to pay some   more to a party in S. L. City. Have just   sent a order for some thing to keep house with   as I was expecting to get married about the   1st of Apr. I have bought a house and lot  and sold the same for brick and lum-  ber the same is not paid for or in others   words I have not received my pay for the same   with many other affairs which would be use-  less to mention. Had I the money on hand

COUNTY COURT HOUSE.    Logan, Utah, Sept 25th 1895    President Wilford Woodruff,    Salt Lake City,    Dear Brother: In answer to yours of June   15th, I beg leave to say that my financial con-  dition is a serious obstacle in the way of   my going on a mission at this time.    I am in debt, have no regular income, and no   regular employment, and the present prospects are that   I shall have to leave home this winter to find em-  ployment. In 1885, I had a similar   call and readily responded; but at that partic-  ular time I occupied a position in which   it was considered I was more valuable at   home than abroad. The result was that at  the unsolicited request of then President Card   and others I was honorably released.    I only regret that at this time my affairs   are in such shape that I am unable   to respond to the call as I did   in the year 1885. Spiritually my   feelings are now as they were then, if 
 Croydon May 26 [18]95    Dear sirs,    In answer to yours of  the 15th ult. will try and tell   you my condition.    I am a married man 26 yrs.  old and without a home, I  have considered well all my  known possible chances to procure   the necessary means to go with,  and find that it is not consist-  ant with my finacial circumstan-  ces.    I am now about even with   the world financially and know   of no chances for me to get   money enough by fall   to go with, otherwise I am   willing to go.    Your Brother  C. E. Condie    Let him state how much time he   would like in which to get ready  to take a mission. We would like   him to go if he has the faith to do so,  And he can report to us when   he gets ready. His Bishop should  endorse his answer.  J. F. S.

As to going to Scandinavia  I will say that I am totally  unacquainted with the language  as I can neither ^speak it^ read  not write.

One year ago I was chosen and my name sent  to you, at October Conference 1894 I reported to   Bro Reynolds that I was then ready for the   Mission and prefered to go then rather than  later on acct of my family being large and   according to my Judgement (my wife being very  weakly) my children would need my care more  in the future than in the past while  smaller.

 D. H. Christensen,  County Superintendent of Schools.    Payson City, Utah, Aug. 24, 1895.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff,   Salt Lake City.  Dear brother:    Not long since  I received a call to labor in the missionary  field in California and to leave in January   next. I assented most gladly. Since that time,  however, conditions (financial) have undergone  a change and I feel that an extension of time  would prove a great accommodation to me.  I would not consent to a release under any  conditions. From present indication I can  arrange to leave in one year from the present  time quite conveniently. We are without a homeâ€”  or any other property and it is necessary for me  to make provision not only for myself but also  for my wife during my absence.    It will be a pleasure for me to go to any part  of the world I may be directed to go to. However, if  I should exercise a choice I should suggest Great  Britain or Germany, with a preference for the latter.   If there is any place where my wife could assist in  the work she could, accompany me with very little   more expense than by remaining home. These matters, of   course, are left entirely in your hands and we will abide  gladly by your decision. Sincerely hoping an extension will  be in harmony with your feelings, I am, your brother    D.
