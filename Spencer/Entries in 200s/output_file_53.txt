In my school boy days, I was intimate  with the Carter boys and at one time Wilford  Woodruff ^(your son)^ sat in the same seat in school  with me.

Furthermore in the fall of 1889 I went to  Ogden on business, was there for 3 days: went  to Salt Lake Saturday night and remained  over Sabbath. I then inquired for you and  learned you were out of town.  Beleive me dear sir: From my observation I found  much to admire and saw nothing to condemn  in the great system which includes so many  people in your community.  Now I will state my desires, and in order

 Richfield, Feb. 27th 1893    Prest. Wilford Woodruff—  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:    Your letter of the 25th inst. is  at hand. In reply to the same I will say that I am  willing to respond to the call; but my circumstances  are rather unfavorable for such an event just now.  When I was released from the San Juan Mission, some  years ago, I was about "broke up." Having a large  young family I thought wise to borrow money, buy a  home and get my family sheltered at once. Besides  keeping my family, and meeting my obligations as  a Church member, I have been unable to do much  in paying what was borrowed, except the interest,  Hence I am still owing several hundred dollars. There  is a prospect of my being able to pay some of this  during this season, and my affairs would be in a  better shape for me to leave home next year. Nevertheless,  if required so to do I will get ready to go soon as I can.  Should my services be required, now or one year hence,  please let me know, and I will endeavor to arrange my  affairs accordingly.    Respectfully Your brother  Lars Christensen    The foregoing is hereby endorsed  Jos. S. Horne, Bp. Richfield 2nd Ward    Give him a year, with our blessing, and when  he gets ready let him report.

 I was ordained to the office of an Elder  last November to fill an appointment as a  missionary in the interest of the Young  Men's Mutual Improvement Association, but  have not been through the Temple.    I have been told that it is generally  thought necessary that missionaries should  have these ordinances performed before they  are sent on missions to the world. Is  that necessary?    I am not married, and now will  not be, on accound of the death of the  friend already mentioned.    I had thought of having my time  extended so that I might have this  blessing, But if I delay going, it seems to  me to be only so much time wasted;  And believing that God will bless me in  every thing I understake in righteousness  unselfishly, and to the best of my abillity,  will leave my best earthly friend to his care

I am a printer, (type-  setter) and a native of Holland, have certificates  of good workmanship therefrom and was em-  ployed there as foreman for the last sixteen  years. I have been in this country three years,  made great progress in the English language  during that time, but have much trouble in  obtaining work. I have worked in Logan  twice, but could not earn more than my board  and lodging; I was in Salt Lake City for three  months, worked six weeks on the Juvenille Instructor  and a few days on the Deseret News; I then  worked here on the Daily Post for eight months  nearly night and day, of which the manager at 
 practized and used among  the Sick and well of our  people, would be of very  great benefit. I have sent  you this lecture for your ap-  proval and recommendation,  with which I would like  to go to work now and lecture  among the Saints. Please  kindly dear Brother, return  the same now to me in  a safe way, & I having  sent it in a registered  package and no doubt  it has reached you.    Please allow me to  refer you to my explanatory  letter, which accompanied  my lecture to you, as well  as the lecture itself.    Yours very Truly  Brother in the gospel  F. A. Neuburger.

I would not feel to   shrink from any duty or  call that the Lord through  his servants may require  of me. Yet I feel very  weak when I think of  the responsibility of carrying  the gGospel to the nations

Dear brother,    Knowing that you are  the leader of this church, I thought  I would apply to you for in-  formation on the following:  Is it possible for cousins, the  son and daughter of sisters, to  go through the temple and  be sealed to each other?

To the First Presidency of  the Church,    Dear Friends, -    I sincerely thank you  for granting me the great  favor of visiting the  beautiful Temple.    To say that my heart  was filled with strange  emotions, as I walked  through the stately rooms  every apparrtment of which  is so dear to the very  heart of Utah, is but a  mild term. I was indeed  enchanted.    Nobody can more earnestly  invoke the best and 
 is that they heard it was  against the rules of the church.  We feel as though it were al-  most impossible for us to  be seperated. And we want to  comply with the rules of the  church. We are not prepared  to get married at present. But,  if convenient to you, would  be pleased to recieve an  answer as soon as possible.    from your brother in the  gospel.    Joseph Goodman.

 Thatcher, Ariz. April 21st 1893.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City,    Dear Brother:    Your communication of April 14th, calling me to  fill a mission to the Southern States, was recently  received and carefully perused. And after careful  consideration and advisement from Pres. Layton, I  am obliged to inform you that it is impossible for  me to fulfill the appointment at present; and after  acquainting you with my present situation, to ask  for a release for a few months or a year, until I can  be better prepared financially.    Nothing would be more pleasing to me, than to respond  to this calling, if I were only able to so, and to know  that my family would be provided for.    My occupation is that of a school teacher, and I  have only a house and "Town Lot", therefore no farm to  support my family when I am away. When I am  gone their support is gone.    Had I known of this call some time ago, I might  have been prepared by now; but when asked concern-  ing the matter last winter, I told the Bretheren of  my quorum my situation, and it was decided

 Pres. W. W.    that I was not financially prepared, and President   Layton refused to endorse my name on these grounds,  and I received the impression that it was dropped  and my name had not been sent in. Therefore,  enstead of preparing myself for this mission, I used  all my means in making improvements on my home  until now all my wages are spent, my school closed  and I am out of employement at present.    I was elected County Surveyor last fall, and have  been to the expence of buying instruments and have   received no remuneration in that direction yet.    So taking it all into consideration it would be im-  possible for me to raise the necessary means to bring me  even to Salt Lake City by the stated time.    My Bishop is away atfrom home, in Utah, at present, but   President Layton being personally acquainted with me  and my circumstances, will endorse this letter.    With these explanations, I trust you will release  me for the present, but if it is desired I shall work  to prepare myself afor a mission in the near future.    A years time would suit me best as I could get   a school next winter which would help me out  greatly.    Your Brother in the Gospel  Thomas E.

 Kanosh May 16/93.  Wilford Woodruff --   Salt Lake City --   Dear Brother:    We learn from our teacher,   Bro. George M. Hanson that he has been   called to take a mission to England. We   very much regret that this is the case, as   he has been our teacher, and he is getting   our school in a first class condition. For   this reason we would be very sorry to have   him leave us, and we therefore respectfully   ask you to allow him to remain with us   for another year as he is willing to do so   in case you see fit to grant him this   privilege. At the end of that time he will   be better prepared financially, to accomplish   a successful mission, and then we will   have no objection to his going. We have   labored under many disadvantages in getting  teachers suitable for our school, but since Bro.  Hanson has been here the children are learning   much better, the parents are taking increased   interest and our school now has the name   of being the best in the County, and we hope   with his aid to make it first class in every   respect during the coming season. Bro. Hanson   informs us that he is to leave Salt Lake on   June 24 -- and ishe is making preparations to do so,

 189    Keokuk Iowa  May the 27th 1893.    President of the Mormon Church;    Dear Sir;    I have in  my possession an old Piano that used to belong  to Joshpeh Smith in the Mormon temple  at Nauvoo Ill. the last time it was tuned  was in 1844 or 1848. I can tell by looking  on the inside of the Piano, it has been a  fine instrument, and is yet. it is in good  condition the case is well perserved and  all it needs is tuning up. I got it because  I am a great lover of Specimens of all kinds  and am always collecting old relics of all   kinds. but this Piano is large and unhandy  to move about and I thought perhaps I  could dispose of it to some one of your church  for you are the ones that should and ought to  have it I think. there is no mistake about it, as  there is a man at Nauvoo Ill ready to make an  Affidavit to that effect, that it belonged one  time to Joseph Smith. write to me immediatly  whether or not you would like to gain posession of   it or not. Yours Resptfly    D. L. Jackson  Keokuk  Iowa    (Cor. 11th and [Timea] Sts.)
