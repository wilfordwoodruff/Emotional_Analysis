In no other way can this information be so thoroughly, accurately, and promptly obtained, as it is here taken directly from the local press. Some of it may sooner or later be found in the trade papers, but the Bureau beats them always by two days, and from that up to eight days, thereby giving subscribers a decided advantage over rivals who depend on the trade papers alone.   names and addresses of people in a position to become buyers, such as tradesmen opening new stores, extending, changing location, burned out; men retiring from business and therefore with money to invest or to spend, perhaps in travel; men suffering from accidents, resulting, for in- stance, in amputations, necessitating the purchase of artificial limbs; women recently becoming moth- ers, and likely to buy baby food or baby carriages; women just married and therefore needing visiting cards or cook books.   obtained from newspapers have been little used, presumably because it costs money to get them so, but in the end it is at least a question if that is not more economical than the use of lists which every day makes more full of errors because of deaths, removals, reverses of fortune, etc., and of the origi- nal accuracy of which there was little guarantee.

They may get it from contractors', architects', building, or real estate journals; or from type-written bulletins. In each of these cases the great bulk of the news in reality comes from local newspapers. We have for sale the source it- self, that is, the newspaper item, which is prefer- able for several reasons: First, re-publishing takes time; the journals are printed either weekly or monthly, and their news must be from three days to a month behind ours; the daily bulletin is one or two days behind us. Secondly, in all transcrip- tion there is a percentage of error, and all conden- sation is likely to omit useful details; the pretence that news re-published in bulletins has been veri- fied by correspondence with architects and owners, is rarely backed up by the facts; clippings give all the news to be had, and give it with the maximum of accuracy. Thirdly, both journals and bulletins ordinarily give but one mention of any structure; by means of clippings, however,  you can keep posted continuously as to the progress of the work, and in the case of all considerable edifices the references in the local press are frequent. Fourth- ly, the value of any business news decreases as the number of users increases; the more competitors, the less profit for each; journals and bulletins are accessible to everybody; the use of clippings, by the very nature of the business, is restricted. No other building news medium whatever furnishes anything like the quantity of news about building in small places.   ten bulletins; and much more than a single jour- nal, but no more than the subscription price of all the journals that would have to be taken to furnish half the news obtainable through clippings, to say ENDENTRY      As you have seen fit to give  me a call as a missionary I will now answer.
