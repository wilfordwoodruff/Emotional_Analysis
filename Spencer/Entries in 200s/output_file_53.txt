In reply to the same I will say that I amwilling to respond to the call; but my circumstancesare rather unfavorable for such an event just now.When I was released from the San Juan Mission, someyears ago, I was about "broke up." Having a largeyoung family I thought wise to borrow money, buy ahome and get my family sheltered at once. Besideskeeping my family, and meeting my obligations asa Church member, I have been unable to do muchin paying what was borrowed, except the interest,Hence I am still owing several hundred dollars. Thereis a prospect of my being able to pay some of thisduring this season, and my affairs would be in abetter shape for me to leave home next year. Nevertheless,if required so to do I will get ready to go soon as I can.Should my services be required, now or one year hence,please let me know, and I will endeavor to arrange myaffairs accordingly.Respectfully Your brotherLars ChristensenThe foregoing is hereby endorsedJos.

 I was ordained to the office of an Elderlast November to fill an appointment as amissionary in the interest of the YoungMen's Mutual Improvement Association, buthave not been through the Temple.I have been told that it is generallythought necessary that missionaries shouldhave these ordinances performed before theyare sent on missions to the world. Isthat necessary?I am not married, and now willnot be, on accound of the death of thefriend already mentioned.I had thought of having my timeextended so that I might have thisblessing, But if I delay going, it seems tome to be only so much time wasted;And believing that God will bless me inevery thing I understake in righteousnessunselfishly, and to the best of my abillity,will leave my best earthly friend to his care

 Pres. W. W.that I was not financially prepared, and President Layton refused to endorse my name on these grounds,and I received the impression that it was droppedand my name had not been sent in. Therefore,enstead of preparing myself for this mission, I usedall my means in making improvements on my homeuntil now all my wages are spent, my school closedand I am out of employement at present.I was elected County Surveyor last fall, and havebeen to the expence of buying instruments and have received no remuneration in that direction yet.So taking it all into consideration it would be im-possible for me to raise the necessary means to bring meeven to Salt Lake City by the stated time.My Bishop is away atfrom home, in Utah, at present, but President Layton being personally acquainted with meand my circumstances, will endorse this letter.With these explanations, I trust you will releaseme for the present, but if it is desired I shall workto prepare myself afor a mission in the near future.A years time would suit me best as I could get a school next winter which would help me outgreatly.Your Brother in the GospelThomas E.

 Kanosh May 16/93.Wilford Woodruff -- Salt Lake City -- Dear Brother:We learn from our teacher, Bro. George M. Hanson that he has been called to take a mission to England. We very much regret that this is the case, as he has been our teacher, and he is getting our school in a first class condition. For this reason we would be very sorry to have him leave us, and we therefore respectfully ask you to allow him to remain with us for another year as he is willing to do so in case you see fit to grant him this privilege. At the end of that time he will be better prepared financially, to accomplish a successful mission, and then we will have no objection to his going. We have labored under many disadvantages in gettingteachers suitable for our school, but since Bro.Hanson has been here the children are learning much better, the parents are taking increased interest and our school now has the name of being the best in the County, and we hope with his aid to make it first class in every respect during the coming season. Bro. Hanson informs us that he is to leave Salt Lake on June 24 -- and ishe is making preparations to do so,

 189Keokuk IowaMay the 27th 1893.President of the Mormon Church;Dear Sir;I have inmy possession an old Piano that used to belongto Joshpeh Smith in the Mormon templeat Nauvoo Ill. the last time it was tunedwas in 1844 or 1848. I can tell by lookingon the inside of the Piano, it has been afine instrument, and is yet. it is in goodcondition the case is well perserved andall it needs is tuning up. I got it becauseI am a great lover of Specimens of all kindsand am always collecting old relics of all kinds. but this Piano is large and unhandyto move about and I thought perhaps Icould dispose of it to some one of your churchfor you are the ones that should and ought tohave it I think. there is no mistake about it, asthere is a man at Nauvoo Ill ready to make anAffidavit to that effect, that it belonged onetime to Joseph Smith. write to me immediatlywhether or not you would like to gain posession of it or not.
