Purpose—The purpose of the Press Clipping Bureau is to supply people with those matters of especial interest to them printed in the newspapers of the country.  Ground Covered.—It reads papers from every region of the United States and Canada, including all the dailies of large cities, most of the dailies of small cities, and thousands of weeklies. A cus- tomer may limit his order to any group of States, or any single State.  Delivery.—A daily service is given whenever it is asked; otherwise its frequency depends on the size of the order, but the clippings are delivered at least once a week to all.  Payment.—The Bureau has two systems of pay- ment, by the piece and by the month. The method of payment does not affect the thorough- ness of service.  The piece price is five cents a clipping and prevails on all orders producing less than 100 clippings a month, on orders of a temporary nature, and on personal orders. No order will be taken for less than 100 clippings, and a minimum charge of ONE DOLLAR A MONTH will be made for keeping any customer on our books, whether clippings are found to that amount or not.  Monthly rates are common in the case of orders in business lines, making the cost ordinarily much less than by the piece, though a low piece price can be quoted on large standing orders and is sometimes preferable.  Remittance.—Payment in advance is not re- quired. Bills are rendered monthly, and we stipu- late that remittance be made to us every month, no matter what the size of the bill.  Credits.—In general, acceptance of clippings binds the customer to pay for them. Credit for matter not coming under the order cannot be given after thirty days. In justice to us we should be ENDENTRY me out and take me to my field of labor. My desire is to go as soon as possible and fulfill the mission and believe the  way will be opened for me to do so.

C R Dorius Bishop of Ephraim South Ward. ENDENTRY informed at once if we are sending classes of mat- ter that are not wanted.  Duplicates.—It is not our intention to send any customer repetitions of the same fact, or copies of the same comment, unless they are specifically requested, but some duplication is unavoidable. Credit is given for duplicates returned at once or at the end of each month.  Trivialities.—We decline to undertake that our employees shall exercise any judgment on ques- tions of triviality. We sell memory, not discrimi- nation. Customers are asked to bear in mind that though more or less of the clippings may be trivial, a single clipping is often worth enough to  offset the cost of many that are worthless.  Restrictions.—The more an order is restricted, the harder it is to remember its limits and the greater the danger useful matter will be omitted. Better pay a little more, and make sure to get all you want. An order may extended or re- stricted at any time.  Discontinuance.—One week's notice of discon- tinuance is to be given. This condition is waived  in the case of orders given for a definite term, as for one month; but if without demur the customer recieves and retains clippings sent to him after the expiration of that term, he is to be responsible for payment therefor at the same rate, no matter what previous conditions may have been imposed.  No order will be accepted without this proviso, meant simply to protect us in case service is inadver- tently continued and the customer fails to call our attention to it.  Competetion.—We will content ourselves with the simple statement that whenever our work is to be put in comparison with that of any other clip- ping bureau, we will make no charge for a week's trial if ours is not then acknowledged the better.  We invite such comparisons.  ENDENTRY Ogden City May 30, 1897  Precedent Wilfird Woodruff  Deat Brother!

Clippings are of use to any business man seek- ing business or doing business outside his own neighborhood.  They give earliest information of all State, county, city and town appropriations; keep sub- scribers posted on the published projects of corpor- ations, military and civic organizations, political and athletic clubs, fraternal and religious societies; and transmit information on a great variety of other enterprises involving the expenditure of money. In no other way can this information be so thoroughly, accurately, and promptly obtained, as it is here taken directly from the local press. Some of it may sooner or later be found in the trade papers, but the Bureau beats them always by two days, and from that up to eight days, thereby giving subscribers a decided advantage over rivals who depend on the trade papers alone.  At the opportune time clippings furnish the names and addresses of people in a position to become buyers, such as tradesmen opening new stores, extending, changing location, burned out; men retiring from business and therefore with money to invest or to spend, perhaps in travel; men suffering from accidents, resulting, for in- stance, in amputations, necessitating the purchase of artificial limbs; women recently becoming moth- ers, and likely to buy baby food or baby carriages; women just married and therefore needing visiting cards or cook books.  For general circularizing the addresses to be obtained from newspapers have been little used, presumably because it costs money to get them so, but in the end it is at least a question if that is not more economical than the use of lists which every day makes more full of errors because of deaths, removals, reverses of fortune, etc., and of the origi- nal accuracy of which there was little guarantee.

Your Brother in the Gosple Arthur Larson  Christian A. Madson Bp ENDENTRY IN CONSTRUCTION LINES.  Dealers in building supplies,  — in materials, in fixtures, in furniture, — nowadays invariably make use of some source of information about construc- tion work. They may get it from contractors', architects', building, or real estate journals; or from type-written bulletins. In each of these cases the great bulk of the news in reality comes from local newspapers. We have for sale the source it- self, that is, the newspaper item, which is prefer- able for several reasons: First, re-publishing takes time; the journals are printed either weekly or monthly, and their news must be from three days to a month behind ours; the daily bulletin is one or two days behind us. Secondly, in all transcrip- tion there is a percentage of error, and all conden- sation is likely to omit useful details; the pretence that news re-published in bulletins has been veri- fied by correspondence with architects and owners, is rarely backed up by the facts; clippings give all the news to be had, and give it with the maximum of accuracy. Thirdly, both journals and bulletins ordinarily give but one mention of any structure; by means of clippings, however,  you can keep posted continuously as to the progress of the work, and in the case of all considerable edifices the references in the local press are frequent. Fourth- ly, the value of any business news decreases as the number of users increases; the more competitors, the less profit for each; journals and bulletins are accessible to everybody; the use of clippings, by the very nature of the business, is restricted. No other building news medium whatever furnishes anything like the quantity of news about building in small places.  Clippings cost about the same as the type-writ- ten bulletins; and much more than a single jour- nal, but no more than the subscription price of all the journals that would have to be taken to furnish half the news obtainable through clippings, to say ENDENTRY Koosharem, Feb. 1, 1898  Presedent Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother As you have seen fit to give  me a call as a missionary I will now answer.

In short, we believe that clippings furnish the most and best building news at least cost.  We make no pretence that a clipping is more than it shows on the face. If there are errors in it, the fault is the newspaper's, not ours. We do not guarantee to send everything; we send all our readers can find. We send much useless matter, but thereby we make sure that no useful matter shall be lost through our own exercise of judg- ment, which is not and cannot be so good as the dealer's.  It need hardly be pointed out that here more than anywhere else the earliest news is far the best news. The salesman or catalogue or letter first on the spot, stands much the best chance of getting the order. We invite comparisons to show if the bulk of our news is not the earliest to be had, and will make no charge for a week's trial if it prove otherwise.  Comments on Construction Clippings.

Through practical experience in the editorial and business management of two class papers, we were led to realize the helpfulness of clippings to class and trade journals, and were enabled to de- velop our business in this line with results mutu- ally beneficial to publishers and ourselves. For some time we have been serving more than a hun- dred of these publications, and believe we are safe in saying that we serve more trade papers than all the other Bureaus in the country put together. Among them are most of the leading journals, such as the Iron Age, Jeweler's Weekly, Boot and Shoe Recorder, Engineering News, Electrical Review, Street Railway Journal, American Banker, Brew- er's Journal, Bicycling World, Hotel World, Har- ness Gazette, Coal Trade Journal.  We act as exchange editors for these publica- tions, so far as the reading and cutting go, sending to each all the pertinent news and miscellany our readers can find. Our shears do much toward fill- ing their columns of news notes; supplying them with fresh anecdotes, jokes, and special articles relating to their respective interests; furnishing topics for editorials.  In the business office the clippings are not of least value, for they give a continual stream of addresses to which to send sample copies and letters soliciting subscriptions, as well as news of concerns starting in business who may advertise.  Clippings supplement correspondence in places where papers have representatives, ensuring that in case of their sickness or negligence the paper shall "get left" on no important happening. They show whether the correspondent is covering the ground thoroughly or not, and if he is relying on the local papers for the bulk of his matter. Well enough for all practical purposes we cover hundreds of places, and even whole States, where it would not pay any publication to maintain a cor- ENDENTRY T. N. TAYLOR, MANAGER. ESTABLISHED 1866.

The service is economical because we read a great many more papers than it would pay any one journal to exchange with, and because it costs little more to read for a hundred papers than for one.

"The Hotel World has tried nearly all the clipping Bureaus, and has never found one yet that could give the service that is given by the Press Clipping Bureau." — Trade Press, Chicago.  "That we have withstood repeated offers from your con- temporaries, who have quoted lower prices, but which we felt must mean inferior service, is proof positive that we appreciate your Bureau."— Boot and Shoe Recorder, Boston.  "We have used clippings furnished us by several press clipping agencies, and have no hesitation in saying that the Press Clipping Bureau has given us by far the best service. The readers have seemed to understand our wants, and have been so diligent in supplying them that little of interest to us has escaped their observation. The service has been prompt, intelligent, and complete." — Manufacturing Jeweler, Providence, R. I.  "We have used your service for ten years, during which time we have had trial service for comparative purposes from almost every other clipping Bureau, many of whom had offered us much lower rates. The fact that we still continue at the same price tells the story. From frequent visits to your large establishment, we are thoroughly ac- quainted with the admirable system by which your work is done." — Guild and Lord, Textile World, Boston.  "We are among the most extensive regular purchasers of newspaper clippings, and at all times for some years we have been served by several of the largest clipping Bureaus. During this period we have given most of the more prom- inent Bureaus a trial. We started with Linn Luce some six or seven years ago and at no time has their service been discontinued. We find it prompt, thorough, and reliable. We are buying more clippings from them than from any other Bureau." — A. B. Gilbert, Associate Editor, Engineering News, New York.

J. F. S. ENDENTRY PERSONAL AND POLITICAL WORK.  The idea of the clipping business was first developed in personal lines, and in them its appli- cation is so obvious as hardly to need explanation. Public men, authors, artists, actors, musicians, — all are interested in what the newspapers say of them, or the things in which they are concerned.  To the political candidate the Bureau is a big boon. The bulk of the clippings come from papers that he does not ordinarily see, cannot easily get at, has not time to read. From them he learns the strength and the weakness of his opponent, sees where he can fortify his own candidacy, learns what pitfalls to avoid, finds who are really his friends.  Campaign committees find clippings useful in much the same way. From them they keep posted on the development of the campaign and the nature of the local work.  For every public man it is important to know the sentiments of his constituents on the questions he may have opportunity to debate, in order that he may keep in touch with them, and not needlessly run counter to their wishes. Furthermore, clip- pings furnish the material for many a speech and many a magazine article.  So far as curiosity goes, the families of public men are often more interested in what is said of them than are the public men themselves. Many persons holding elective or executive offices have ordered clippings partly to gratify the interest of wives, sons, daughters, or parents.  Another element of value in clippings not to be lost sight of is what may be called their bio- graphical or auto-biographical value. Statesmen formerly had time to keep voluminous diaries; today they can rarely attend to such matters. Clip- pings will serve somewhat the same end.

WILFORD WOODRUFF, Prest. Church of J. C. of L. D. S., Salt Lake City, Utah.  Respected Sir; It is with the deepest interest that I read in this mornings ^p^aper, of an interview published therein regarding your- self and the members of the Semi-centennial Celebration which is to take place this year, and noting that Judge Colborn was the main apeaker for the committie, and noting that you were in favor of giving said committe $10,000 to aid them in the celebration, I address you relative to the matter, and call your attenti^o^n to a few facts of which you may not be aware.  In the first place, does it not appear that we have many of Utah's sons, members of the church who are as capable, and even more so, of, attending this afafair, without the guidance of such a man Colburn. While true he was appointed by the governor, I yet must candidly con- fess that it reflects no great credit on the govrernor, for this man Col- burn came to Utah during the I"boom" and it was such men as him, that constituted the "Liberal" party that were so harsch in their condem- nation of the church, and its follwers. It was such men was him, that have never done anything for Utah or your city, but that it helped them first. Can it be said that Utah must needs accept the services of outsiders, to portray the efforts of Utah's pioneers, when in fact they know nothing of it, beyond what they may read, or hear, and then- in what do^i^storted, irrelevant manner?  Last season, when that Mid-summer Carnival was given, I was at a meeting at which this man arose, and delivered an address, during which he used words to the effect that he "was tired of seeing home faces, and we wanted outsiders to come in and get the benefits" or words to that effect.  Then there is another man on that committee, whom I know well, that is E. G. Rognon. He is a good, smart young man, but he issnn't a ntive^native^ of Utah, neither does he represent her, beyond what affects his ^own^ interests  Now then, I ask you candidly, do you think these the kind of men to handle money to represent Utahs great celebartion, and to handle the money of the people whom they slightlingly designate as "Mormons?"  I am addressing this letter to you, generally, but while I speak for others, I confess I speak as much for myself.  I am a Utah boy; born of its greated^st^ people; a grand-son of Jos. A Young, men who have liaaid ^down^ their lives and liberties on behalf of our church and its noble work. I fought in the great Peoples-Liberal party campaign, six years ago, and though I was a humble worker, my work was at least sincere. I carried a drum, and I hammered at it too, and had all the others made as much noise as I tried to do, the echo of our great vistory (instead of defeat) would go down in counlttless ages. Two years ago, nearly three, I—with some other ^y^oung men, received permission to use the Bee-hive house for a demonstaration for the old pioneers. It was given, and 800 of them were entertianed, and lived again in the days of long ago. Bills on that occasion, were a matter of necessity contracted, and one of them, I have been sued for, and the judgement entered against me, be- cause I have been unable to pay it. Now, do you call this just? What benefit did I—or any of us get from it? Nothing but that—which is more money than money can ever buy—tears of gratitude from old eyes, and from old lips, and old forms, within the shadow of the grave, blessed and thanked us for what we done. And that night too, did I not act as mediator? R. N. Baskin, at that time mayor, on my personal solicitation attended, and for the first time in his life, commingled with the "hated Mormons" and grasped them hand to had^nd^  Now then, again I ask, why are such men as this allowed these things?  Can Utah not furnish brains and muscle enough, to dispense with the services of these outsiders^?^ Ten, twelve, fifteen years ago, when our ENDENTRY St. George Jan 20, 1897,  Prest.
