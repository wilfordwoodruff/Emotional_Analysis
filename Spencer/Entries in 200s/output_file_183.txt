I have been looking for his death for months, the last time that I saw President Joseph Smith the Patriarch I was on my way to George A. Smith was with me. Father Smith was sick and he  asked us to lay hands on him. We did so and I Blessed him. The last time I saw Mother Smith she asked to have a Blessing at my hands I felt to Bless her. Before I started for St George in the spring I felt to Bless Br Pratt with an Apostles Blessing as far as I had the right and Power  to do so. I laid my hands upon his head and blessed him as I felt led by the spirit of the Lord. And when I am dead and gone all those Blessings recorded will be found in my Journals. I want to say I cannot say  mourn over the death of Br Pratt. My friends who have been acquainted with my views know this. I cannot mourn over Apostles Prophets or inspired men, who have died in the faith of the Gospel of Christ. Any Man or  woman who has kept the Celestial law of God on the Earth and have died in the faith, will open their Eyes to a scene of Glory and Blessings and Eternal Life that man cannot obtain upon any other principle.

Now the few moments we have to spend with yoo Brethren and sisters in speaking upon this occasion, what can we do, what do you expect we are going to give you a history of Orson Pratt?

O ye six thou- sand High Priest, who hold the Melchesedec Priesthood of the order  of the Son of God. O ye ten thousand Elders who occupy these  Rocky mountains, And the Lesser Priesthood, And the hundred  and fifty thousands Saints who have gathered to Zion can you afford  to spend onde day or one hour to the neglect of the Kingdom of Good to gather unto yourselves riches, or the honors of this world No he would  say you cannot do it with safety, before the heavens, Before the Gods  nor before one another. That would bye the voice of Bro Orson Pratt to these Latter Day Saints could he speak to us. Now as far as I  am concerned I need say but vary little more with regard to Bro  Orson Pratt. He is what we call dead, his body is here before us  His immortal soul, This Embryo of the God Head is in the spirit world, it  is alive, it will live as long as Our Heavenly Father lives. Bro Pratt has passed through many scenes of life in his Early ministrations he has  many a time travelled through Indianna preaching the gospel when He was vary sick from the ague yet though sick he would go out  at night and Preach. He travelled thousands of miles in those Early  days in this way in bearing his testimony of the gospel of Christ  His Testimony is closed, His voice is hushed in death you nor I will not hear his voice any more untill we meet him in the spirit world  and that will not be a great while at least for some of us. I want to say to the Living let this admonition have its Effect upon us. what- ever we have got to do let us work while the day lasts.

The first sermon I Ever herd him preach was in Aprail 1834, in a house  in Kirtland. it was there I listened to the first Testimony I ever heard from him also from Oliver Cowdry Joseph Smith the Prophet and one or two  others. I was associated with him then for this was Just before we started in Zions Camp for Missouri. Their are a few members of Zions Camp here to day. Their is a small remnant of them left All those brethren who were in the camp, our travelling a thousand miles led by a Prophet of God will remember the scenes we  were called upon to pass through we were visited by the Cholera  The first circumstance of the kind that we as a company ever  experience. Br Orson Pratt whose body lies before us lay at the point of Death as also George A Smith and a number of others  while some twenty of the Brethren were laid in the grave. The Lord took whom he would take, and preserved those whom He would preserve according to the council of his own will No man  could pass through a much worse sickness than the Cholera, men  weighing near towo hundred pounds were reduced to seventy  or one hundred pounds in a vary short time. Br Pratt as I  have said lay at the point of death, yet during his sickness he manifested that indomitable determination that has governed his whole life from that day to this. while death as it were sought to overcome him, he rolled over upon his back closed his Eyes  clasped his teeth and shut his hands and apparently said  now death do your worst I defy you for in the name of Israels   ENDENTRY June 10th 1885 2 Chron 3 Ch, 8 vers 600 Talents of Gold used in overlaying in  the House in this verse was $2004,000 dollars. 2 Chron 8:18  Hiram sent Solomon 450 talents of Gold $1,503,000 dollars 2 Chron 9:9 Queen of sheba gave solomon 120 talents of Gold  $400,800 dollars. 2 chron 89:13, Solomon receivd in one  year 666 Talents of Gold $2224,440. 9 ch 15 v. 200 targets  of Gold $120048. 16 v. 300 shields of gold $90024.

Bro Orson Pratt makes the ninth Apostle who have opened their Eyes in the spirit  world since we came through Emigration Canyon on the 24 July  in 1847. These things give me vary peculiar reflections it says vary loudly to Bro Woodruff Bro Taylor and a great many others "be  ye also ready." It says to all these Apostles and all these Elders  of Israel "Be ye also ready" whatever you have to do, do it while the day lasts. Be true and faithful to your God, to your covenants,  to your Priesthood and to the mighty responsibility resting upon your  head. This is the voice of the spirit of God unto us. I thank God for  the gospel. I thank God for the promises of Eternal life which have been revealed unto us. I thank God for the Holy Priesthood.

Bro Orson Pratt has lived in  this Church longer than any other man who has been in it Perhaps He has lived longer in it than vary few men ever  will live in the Church and Kingdom of God in the flesh He has crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times And has travelled more miles than any other man in the Church. He has preached more sermons. He had brought many thousands into the Church. He had this revelation given to him which I have read in your hearing he has lifted up his voice long and loud. He has declaired the words of life and salvation to this Generation, his garments are clean from the blood of the inhabitants of the Earth and his testimony will rise against this generation to condemn them. I believe there is no man  living, I do not say it is so but give it as my belief that there  is no man living to day in the whole gentile world that has accumulated By hard study and labor without the assistance of teachers the same amount of mathematical, Philosphical and Astrionom- ical Knowledge that Br Orson Pratt obtained. He has probably published and written more upon science, astronomy, mathematics and upon  the gospel of Christ than any other man in our Church if not in the United States.
