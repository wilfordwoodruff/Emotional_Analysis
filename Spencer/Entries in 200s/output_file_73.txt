 worthy, as our Brother Erastus, and,  above all, follow in the steps of the  great Exemplar of all righteousness,  our Lord Jesus Christ, whose grace be  ever with you all. Amen.    WILFORD WOODRUFF,    In behalf of the absent members of  the Council of the Apostles.    Benediction was pronounced by  Patriarch John Smith.    At the close of the services in the   Tabernacle the procession formed on  South Temple Street, in the following  order:    Band.  Apostles, as Pall Bearers.  Hearse.  Family.  Choir.  First Presidents of Seventies.  President of Stakes and High Councilors.  High Priests' Quorums.  Elders' Quorums.  Presiding Bishopric.  Bishops and Counselors.  President of Teachers' Quorums.  Presidents of Deacons' Quorums.  Committee of Arrangements.  Citizens.    The streets along the route or pro-  cession were lined by large numbers   of people. The cortege consisted of  44 vehicles filled with relatives and  friends of the deceased, exclusive of  the carriage containing the pall bear-  ers, which was ahead of the hearse,  and the band, which led the proces-  sion.    On arriving at the cemetery the  choir sang—    O, my Father, thou that dwellest  In the high and glorious place.    Counselor Daniel H. Wells offered  the dedicatory prayer, and the remains  of the faithful apostle of the Lord  Jesus were consigned to the tomb.

 9    Priesthood in all ages of the world. The spirit of Elias  is manifested in several instances in the gathering of Israel in the last days.    Now at the present day we have no ^known^ literal  descendant of Aaron, and hence we have to take  High Priests to officiate as Bishops to preside over  this branch of the Aaronic Priesthood. Nevertheless  a Priest after the order of Aaron has a right to   baptise for the remission of sins; he has a right  to break bread and administer the sacrament;  he has a right to officiate in all the ordinances  of the house of God as far as the Levitical Priesthood  extends. The Aaronic Priesthood, however, has no  power to administer the laying on of the hands for the  reception of the Holy Ghost; that is an ordinance  which belongs to the Melchesedec Priesthood, of which  the Aaronic Priesthood is an appendage or branch. The  Aaronic Priesthood has several offices, such as ^Bishops^, Priests,  Teachers, & Deacons, and the duties of these  offices are all made plain in the Book of

 11    Priesthood had power and authority to ordain  Priests, Teachers & Deacons. My answer was, yes. That  any man holding the office of an Elder, a Seventy,  or a High Priest, a Patriarch, or an Apostle had  the right, power, and authority to ordain any person  to any office in the church and kingdom of God  as high as they held themselves, whether they had  been ordained to these Offices^Aaronic Priesthood^ or not, as long as  they held the fulness of the Melchesedec Priesthood.  At the same time no man should so ordain  where there is an organized branch of the Church  only by the consent of those Presiding over   that branch. Where there is no organized branch  a man has a right to set in order a branch  according to the order of God—that is, he has  the right and privelege to ordain ^to^ as high an  office as he holds himself.

 12    a Teacher. I was next ordained priest. I  travelled some ten thousand miles, I suppose,  or nearly so, while holding the office of a priest.  I baptised a great many persons while travelling  alone. But while holding that office—the office  of a Priest—I could not confirm, nor did  I attempt to, because I had no right, power,  or authority, to do so; but an Elder has a right  to do so, a High Priest, or a Seventy, has a right  to lay ^on^ hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost.    Now, I wish to say a few words in regard  to this principle. Here comes another question,  which has been asked me a great many times,  and which I will answer according to the view  I have of it. When you conform a man, what  are you to seal upon him—the Gift of the  Holy Ghost, or the Holy Ghost? My answer so

 Orderville, July 23rd 1896    President, Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother,    I desire to call your attention  to the last time you was in Orderville. In  our conversation, I told you, I had received  several remarkable dreams. You then express-  ed a desire to hear them; but circumstances  intervened and seemed to hinder me, at that time.  Ever since, at verious times, there has been two  spirits at work with me: the one prompting me to  write to you, and the other saying, it is nonsense and   folly. I now feel that there can be no harm at  least, and that the Lord brings about good results  by very small means. As you desired to hear them  and of the two promptings, I feel best in writing to you,  beleiveing there can be no harm, I write two of  the shortest ones, because, I beleive, if erthere  be wrong, you can desern it. over

You will see in reading the Bible, the Book of Doctrine  and Covenants, the Book of Mormon, and all  records of divine truth almost universally where  this subject is referred to—you will see the  word "Holy Ghost" made use of. Not but what  there are some exceptions to this rule. In  the revelations of God, in making remarks sometimes,  the words "the gift of the Holy Ghost" is used. But  there is a difference, a great difference between  the gifts ^Gifts^ of the Holy Ghost, and the Holy Ghost.  Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was  baptised, but he could not have received  the gifts of the Holy Ghost without he had been  baptised—at least this was the Prophet Joseph  Smith's doctrine, and it was according to my  view of the subject. Now, the gift of the

 14    Holy Ghost—what is it? Why, it is the testimony  of the Father and Son. That testimony goes forth  to all the world, and when persons are willing  to receive the spirit of God, the testimony of the  servants of God, they do receive in a measure  the Holy Ghost, or the spirit of God, to enlighten  their minds. They must be born again before  they can see the kingdom of God. No man  can see this kingdom unless he is born again,  and that, too born of the spirit; but no man  can enter into the kingdom of God without he  is born ^both^ of the water and the spirit. These  things are very plainly made manifest. Well,   what are the gifts of the Holy Ghost? Why,  it is speaking in tongues, the interpretation of  tongues, healing the sick, casting out devils,  raising the dead, opening the eyes of the 
 In the year 1868 my father received his second  anointing, and in about three week he died.  About two years afterward, I dreamed father  came to me while I was in bed, the house was  lit up like day: he talked to me for some time,  telling, which seems to me, things that were coming  to pass, and things which I should do. After his  conversation with me, he went out of the house, and  I awoke or come to my self, for it seemed that I had  not been asleep. There was considerable light in  the house, I arose up and looked out of the  window and saw the hills and mountains very plain  and thought it was day light, as the moon give  no light at that time, as it was near the new moon.  I started to dress, when the thought came to me to  think it all over, and I would be better able to  tell mother, just as it was given me. I placed my  elbow on the pillow and my hand over my eyes  while I thought it over. Then I went to get up  and found the room in darkness: it scared  me so, that every thing father had said, was taken from  me.

 15    blind &c. The whole catalogue is laid before  us by the ancient apostles, as well as the   apostles of our day and generation. These  are my views with regard to the difference be-  tween the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the  Holy Ghost.    And this is what I consider the spirit  and power of Elijah. Elijah, or the spirit of  Elijah, held the keys of the gathering principle,  and it has been manifested in every age of  the world when the Melchesedec priesthood has  been amongst the children of men from  the days of Father Adam down to our day.  John the Baptist ordained Joseph Smith to the  Aaronic Priesthood. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:66-75##] Peter, James, and John  ordained him to the apostleship and the keys  of the kingdom of God. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] Elijah committed 
 That every thing he said should be taken from me  makes it seem remarkable. About a year after   that, I dreamed father came to me, he stood in the  air above the ground, I thought it was his spirit.  He asked me if I would finish his house, He  then invited me to come and see what needed to be done.  I went with him, and saw a large frame building  standing on a solid rock foundation, but it needed  the shingles, weather boarding, windows and doors.  He asked me if I would finish it. I told Him I  would. He then said:  "I am going away to be  gone a long time before I come again to talk to   you." He than started up into heaven and  continued untill he went out of my sight.  I then awoke and found it to be a dream.  It has now been about Twenty Five years  since, and ^I^ have had no talk with him, in dream,  which makes it seem the more remarkable.  I dreamed a short time ago of receiving a letter  from him. handed to me by my mother. she died  over

Gentlemen:    On the 28th, 29th or 30th inst. there will be an  excursion party of some three hundred prominent hotel men, bankers,  and merchants, with their wives, from the eastern states, who will stop  in ^"^Salt Lake City^"^ for one day en^'^route homeward from California.  The Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Hotel Men of our city  desire that they shall be nicely entertained during their stay here.  In view of this, a programme has been arranged for a drive through-  out the city, a special train the ^"^Saltair Beach^"^ and, ^&^ if possible,  a ^"^tabernacle concert^"^. For the last named we now address you regard-  ing it. They arrive here in the morning and will take the drive from   half past ten until half past eleven^,^ and would like to go to the  tabernacle at between that hour and twelve o'clock and listen to  a half hour's music by the professor.    Would it be consistent and please you to grand this request [FIGURE]  I am sure there will be no feature of the programme that will be more  interesting than this, and if you will concent it will be greatly  appreciated both by the visitors and by ourselves.    We desire to have about twenty-five business men accom-  pany the party on the drive, to the concert^,^ and to the lake^,^ and we  would very much like your assistance. A number of prominent men have  expressed a willingness to aid us and become a part of the reception 
 about Eighteen months ago. and has since  visited and talked to me in a dream.    Dear Brother I trust I have not imposed upon  your time, by me writing to you. I know that  if I need be rebuked for thus writing to you,  it will be done with a brother's love.    Trusting I may receive a few comforting words   from you.

[##Doctrine and Covenants 110:11##] And my view is this: That the  God of Israel has restored all these keys, powers,  and principles, with their blessings and priveleges,  which belong to the Aaronic and Melchesedec  Priesthoods. All the keys were sealed upon the  head of Joseph Smith while in the flesh. There  is no key that belongs to this dispensation

 I ask and desire this morning the  faith and prayers of the Latter-day   Saints in my behalf while I stand before   you. This is not merely an idle cere-  mony, for if I possessed all the oratory   and learning of the ancient Greeks and  Romans it would not give me power to   edify one immortal spirit in the children   of men or to point any immortal soul to  the way of salvation. I am entirely de-  pendent upon the Lord. I always have  been during my life, and in my travels   and pilgrimage, preaching the Gospel of   Christ to my fellow men.  It does not   make any difference what age a man is   in the preaching of the Gospel, whether   he be twenty-five, ninety or five hun-  dred years of age, if he is only inspired   by the Spirit and power of God. Many   of the ancients lived to a very great  age. Father Adam up to the last speech   he ever made to his children, according   to the revelations of God, was filled   with the Holy Ghost, and he was nearly   a thousand years of age.    I have some things upon my mind I   would like to present to the Latter-day  Saints if I can get the spirit of them.   I think it would be profitable to us to   spend a little time in reflecting and  meditating upon the powers that be--  the powers that exist to-day on the earth   and have existed from eternity unto   eternity-- good and evil, light and dark-  ness, Christ and Belial, or Lucifer, the  son of the morning. When we look   over the history of the world we can   see from the creation of Father Adam   down to our day the operation of these  two powers. And these powers will   exist until the end of time, and from   that time henceforth, until there is a   change in the destiny of the spirits of   men. It seems that from the time   of the great rebellion in heaven,   when one-third of the hosts of heaven   were cast down for their rebellion   against the great Eloheim and Jehovah,   the Creator of heaven and earth, there  has been a warfare against God, against   Christ, against His Church, against His   Priesthood, and against everything that  would tend to salvation and eternal life.  And in looking over the history of the   world, from the revelations of God to  us, we can see in the peopling of the   earth and in the building up of cities by   the inhabitants of the earth, the powers   of evil, of darkness, and of sin have had   great control over the children of men.   Men were led to sin and to do evil until   those ancient cities, like modern ones,   were filled with iniquity. The Lord   raised up prophets and inspired men in   all those dispensations, when cities and   nations became ripened into iniquity, to  give them commandments, to warn them  of the judgments of God, and to tell   them what to do to escape those judg-  ments. And when these cities and na-  tions were fully ripened in iniquity and   would not repent, all that those proph-  ets proclaimed unto them came to pass.   You may take all the ancient cities--  Thebes, Nineveh, Tyre, Sidon, Babylon,   Jerusalem, and others--and they had  prophets raised up among them. They   were warned of God, and were told  what awaited them unless they repented   of their sins, and all came to pass as the   prophets spake unto them. My mind   rests upon Jeremiah. The Lord called   him in his day to go and warn King   Zedekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusa-  lem, and the prophet told them what   would come to pass. The king and the  inhabitants were wroth against him and   they persecuted him, and he had so  many trials to go through that a man in   reading of them would not be surprised   if Jeremiah felt like saying, "You may   all go to destruction for what I care; I'm   not going to stay with you." But the   Lord had said unto Jeremiah, "Before I   formed thee in the belly I knew thee;   and before thou camest forth out of the  womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained   thee a prophet unto the nations." All  that Jeremiah said to the inhabitants of  Jerusalem came to pass, and the history  of Jerusalem is terrible. The whole   house of Israel had warning; prophets   were raised up among them, and they   prophesied unto them. All the judg-  ments that visited them were foretold.    I speak of these things because they   are on my mind, and we are in a some-  what similar condition ourselves. Take  the days of Christ.  As soon as Christ   was born how quickly Herod sought  His life! Joseph had to take Mary and   the young child into Egypt in order to   save the child. The power of evil was  after Him for His destruction. And did   the Savior, when He was grown to   manhood, escape that power? Was   there anything about Him in this re-  spect that differed from others of the  human family? There was not. He   was tempted, He was tried, and the   enemy labored for His destruction   through His whole life. His mission   was a short one. It was only three   and a half years from the time he en-  tered into the Priesthood until He was   crucified, and that, too, by this power.   And the sorrow that has come upon the   Jewish nation in consequence of this   act of theirs, and the bill that they have   had to pay, has been indeed great, and   all that the prophets said concerning   that has come to pass to the very letter.  Nearly nineteen hundred years have   rolled around since the death of Christ,   and that yoke has been upon the neck of   the Jews from that day until this. They  have been trampled under the foot of   the Gentiles, in fulfilment of the words   of the prophets of God, and because   they shed the blood of the Savior, their  Shiloh. And it has not yet come to an   end with them.    John, while upon the Isle of Patmos,   clothed with the glory of God and   wrapt in the visions of heaven, por-  trayed, prophesied, and wrote concern-  ing the events that should take place   down to the coming of the Son of Man.   He told us concerning the restoration   of the everlasting Gospel. He says:    And I saw another angel fly in the midst of   heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach   unto them that dwell on the earth.    Saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give  glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is   come.    That has come to pass. The time has   come when the Lord has set His hand   to fulfil the flood of revelation contained   in all the records of divine truth. The   Lord raised up a man, ordained and  prepared from the foundation of the   world, to stand in the last dispensation   and fulness of times, to receive the Gos-  pel and the Priesthood, to organize the   Church of God, and to prepare the way  for the coming of the Son of Man. We   know that these two powers were mani-  fested with the Prophet Joseph as they   were in the days of the Savior. The   very moment that he received these   revelations from God and proclaimed   them, it seemed as though all earth and  hell were let loose for his destruction.   It appeared as if the devil was afraid  that he would live to carry out these   prophecies. You know his history. Some   of us have been associated with that   Prophet. We have seen this spirit of  the evil one manifested.  The Prophet   Joseph was never let alone by the pow-  ers that exist until he, like the Savior  and others, sealed his testimony with  his blood. But during the short time  that he dwelt in the flesh he accom-  plished all that he was ordained to   do. He not only organized the Church,   but he brought forth this book of revela-  tions that I hold in my hand-- the Book   of Doctrine and Covenants, which con-  tains some of the most sublime revela-  tions God ever revealed to man on the   earth. The Lord also chose Twelve   Apostles, High Priests, Elders, Priests,  Teachers, and Deacons, and set in order   the whole organization of the Church of

The Gospel of Christ is very plain, is very  simple, and is very cheap. The poor can receive  the Gospel as well as the rich. In ancient  days they were commanded to go forth and  preach the gospel without purse and script. Well,  We have travelled a great many thousand  miles in that way, chargeable to no man, and  just as ready to baptise a poor man as a   rich one, and to administer unto him all  the rights ordinances which he had a right  to in the church and kingdom of God.

 578  THE DESERET WEEKLY.  God as it exists today.  And what has   been the consequence of this? I desire   to bring the minds of the brethren to   those days.  Just as quick as the Twelve   Apostles were appointed and the Church   was set in order, the devil labored with   all the power that he possessed to turn   aside these men and inspire them to  leave the Church of God. Because of   this it seemed to be very hard work   many times for men who had received   the Priesthood and even the Apostleship  to magnify that Priesthood and to stand in   their calling until they could finish their   work in the flesh. I have made a re-  mark once or twice in my teachings with   regard to the great apostasy in Kirtland.   I passed through that scene, as did   some others who are now with us, and I   wish now to refer to it because it is  something we should lay to heart.   Even Apostles took occasion to rise up   and endeavored to dictate and direct the   Prophet of God. Here, brethren and  sisters, was a manifestation-- and a very   strange one, too-- of the power that the  devil had over the leading men whom   God raised up to assist in laying the  foundation of this Church and in bring-  ing forth the Book of Mormon. Those   who testified to the Book of Mormon  were led away through not keeping the  commandments of God and thinking  that they themselves were great men.  Some of them were learned men; some  of them considered themselves very  smart men, and they were so smart   that they wanted to dictate and direct the  Prophet of God. The consequence of  all this was that they turned aside  from the commandments of God. Some of  them had been true and faithful in their  labors in the ministry. I have heard  Oliver Cowdery testify of the Book of   Mormon by the power of God, when it   seemed as if the very earth trembled  under his feet. He was filled with the   Holy Ghost and the power of God   while he was faithful; and so were many   of these men. But Oliver Cowdery   yielded to the temptation of the evil one,  and we may say he apostatized. So did  Martin Harris, and several others con=  nected with them. They left the   Church, they turned against Joseph, and  they said he was a fallen prophet, and  they themselves wanted to direct the  Church. I have remarked that there  was a time when there were but two  of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles   then in the town of Kirtland who stood   by Joseph Smith and upheld him as a  Prophet, Seer, and Revelator. I was not a  member of that quorum at that time; I   was a Seventy. Several of these men  called upon me in the time of this apos=  tasy and asked me to join them against   the Prophet; the Prophet was fallen,  they said. Now, I had seen enough   myself of the Prophet of God, and I  had read enough of the revelations of God  through him, to know that he was a   Prophet of God and not a fallen prophet.  I saw that these men were yielding to   the devil, and I told them so. Said I:  "You will all go to hell unless you  repent. Joseph has been raised up by   the power of God; he has organized this  Church, he has been true and faithful to   God and to the Church and kingdom of   God here on the earth, and you will fall  and go to perdition unless you repent  of your sins and turn from the position   you are in to-day." A good many of  them did fall. I will here name one  instance. I saw one of these Apostles in   the Kirtland Temple, while the Sacr-  ament was being passed, stand in the  aisle and curse the Prophet of God to his  face while he was in the stand, and  when the bread was passed he  reached out his hand for a piece of bread  and flung it into his mouth like a mad  dog. He turned as black in the face  almost as an African with rage and with   the power of the devil. What did he  do? He ate and drank damnation to  himself. He did not go and hang him-  self; but he did go and drown himself,  and the river went over his body while  his spirit was cast into the pit, where he  ceased to have the power to curse either  God or His Prophet in time or in etern-  ity. [note in CD: The only Apostle fitting President Woodruff's description was Lyman Eugene Johnson, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from 1835 to 1838, who was disfellowshipped during a conference held in Kirtland, 3 September 1837. After making appropriate confessions, he was restored to his original position a few days later. Johnson was, however, excommunicated at Far West, Mo., on 13 April 1838. He drowned in the Mississippi river at Prairie du Chien, Wis., 20 December 1856.] I may say that David Patten was  not in Kirtland at this time; he was in   Missouri. He never apostatized, but  died a martyr.  Brethren and sisters, I have passed  through these scenes, and it was a   serious time. And I will tell you the  devil is not dead to-day, but will war   against us and against this Church, as  far as he has power, while we dwell in   the flesh. I thank the Lord, however,   that I know for myself that this Church   will stand, and the Lord will bear it off   triumphant. We have passed those   days of affliction and sorrow; but I want  to say to my brethren, one and all, we  still have got to watch unto prayer. If   there is any place where the devil can  lead us astray he will do it. We are not  safe until we get through with this pro-  bation. I thank God for one thing:  I am satisfied for myself that those days  are passed and gone. There is no man   in heaven or on earth will ever live to   see such a day again. We are too near  the end; we are too near the coming of   the Son of Man. The Lord Almighty  has called a class of men upon whose  shoulders he has laid the responsibility  for this great work. He has chosen the   weak things of the world, and we have  these responsibilities resting upon us.  I am satisfied for myself that the ser-  vants of God whom He has chosen will,   as a rule, be true and faithful unto   death. How dark a man must be in his  mind to get into such a condition as  these Apostles were. I heard some of  them bear testimony before God, angels  and men that they had received the   ministration of angels, and having that  knowledge, what a condition they must  have been in when they apostatized!   We want to guard ourselves with   regard to these matters. We have got  to look to the Lord to assist us in the  cause in which we are engaged. I hope  and pray that I may live to see the per-  fect union of the Twelve Apostles   with the Presidency of this Church and  the union of the whole Church. We  have this work upon our shoulders and  the Lord is watching over us. I will say  to all the nations of the earth, you can-  not turn aside or overthrow the designs  of the Lord; they will come to pass  in the earth exactly as they have been  promised to the children of men.  We are here upon a mission, and it is   a great mission. We are blessed in   living in this day and generation. We   ought to try and make the most of it we   can. We ought to try and improve our  time, magnify our calling, and do our  duty. I will say to the Latter-day Saints,   the Lord has called and chosen   us to stand as the leaders of the people-  --the Presidency, the Twelve Apostles  and the various quorums and positions  which we are in, and we are responsible  to God for the course we pursue in  these matters. True, we need the faith  and fellowship of the Saints; we need   their assistance; but inasmuch as we do  our duty the blessings of God will be  with us. I know for myself that the   Lord has set His hand to carry out His  great purposes and prepare the way for  the coming of the Son of Man. We have  passed through a long period of time,   as men count time, in our history. I will   here refer to one incident:  When Christ   and Peter, James and John went into   the mount, Moses and Elias were mani-  fest to them, and Jesus was transfigured   before them. The last time the Apostles  ever met with the Prophet Joseph   Smith, there were eleven of us present,  --nine Apostles, himself and his brother   Hyrum. He likewise was transfigured   before us, as far as mortal man can be.  The room which he was in was filled as  with consuming fire by the power of   God. His face was clear as amber, he   was clothed with the power of God.   We did not know he was going to leave  us any more than the Apostles knew   the Savior was going to leave them in  that day. But he told us what our   duties were. He laid before us what  God required at his hands and the or-  dinances unto which he had been  ordained by the power of God. He  said the Lord had sealed upon his head  every ordinance, every key and every   power belonging to this dispen-  sation of the fulness of times; and,  he added, "I have sealed these things   upon your heads; now you must go forth  and bear off this kingdom or you will   be damned." That was a very strong  remark to us. I have never forgotten   it from that day to this. I realize that   God was with him. And He has been  with His people. He is with Zion to-day.   He will continue to be. Though  all the powers of darkness may war   against us, the Lord is our Friend and   He will sustain us and give us power to  build up Zion and to carry out this  work until the coming of the Son  of Man. Therefore, let your hearts be  comforted. These Apostles, I am  satisfied, are of one heart and mind.  I know they are united with us; I know  we are united with them. This is a  great joy and consolation to me. We  all should be united in the cause in  which we are engaged. Inasmuch as we  do this we shall come off triumphant.  I have no fear about Zion; I never had.  It is written, as with a pen upon a rock,   and is the voice of God, that Zion shall  stand. All the prophecies that the Lord  has given as contained in the Bible,  the Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine   and Covenants will be fulfilled to the   very letter. Not one jot or one tittle  will fall unfulfilled. Zion will arise and   flourish, and the glory of God will rest  upon her. When I cast my mind over   the signs of the times, when I look at  the fulfilment of prophecy and observe   what is taking place in the earth I see  the hand of God manifest and the fulfil=  ment of prophecy and revelation.  These angels of God that have been   standing in the temples of heaven  holding sharp sickles day after day plead-  ing with God to let them go forth to   reap down the earth have been com-  manded of the Lord to wait until the   wheat was gathered into the garner, and   then they might go forth and reap down  the earth. If the world wants to know  what is coming to pass, let them read  the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the   Doctrine and Covenants; let them read   these revelations of St. John. As God   lives they will come to pass. Not one   of them will fall unfulfilled. And the

The saints of  God have  received the gospel, they see the power  of the gospel, their eyes are open to see, their  ears to hear, and their hearts to understand.  They are not only born of the spirit, but  born of the water. They can enter into the  kingdom of God. They have had hands laid  upon them by those having ^power and^ authority to  bestow the Holy Ghost. No man has  power in and of himself to bestow the  Holy Ghost or any other gift or grace  upon the children of men. We cannot in  and of ourselves lay hands upon the  sick to heal them, or to cast out devils,

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  579  hand of God is beginning to be man-  ifest in the earth. Judgment is at the  door; calamity awaits the nations of the  earth; but we ourselves should be pre-  pared to stand in holy places while the  judgments of God are manifest in the   earth.    Now, brethren and sisters, let us be  humble before the Lord; let us remem-  ber our prayers; let us try to do our   duty; and when we do this. the blessings  of God will be with us. I felt yester-  day that I wished I could see all the   young men in Israel before Brother J.   E. Talmage while he spoke to us for   half an hour (it ought to have been two  hours) on the evil of this tobacco busi-  ness. We should let alone all these  evils, and our children should also, that  they might be prepared to go forth as  holy vessels and servants of God to  bear record of this Gospel.  We are  not yet through preaching the Gospel.  We send our sons abroad, and many of  them go before they know whether this is  the Church of God or not. I need not   stand up here and testify before this   congregation that this is the Church of   God on the earth. Thousands of you have  know that for yourselves. You have been   abroad; I have been abroad; these  Apostles have been abroad; and we   have administered the ordinances of the  Gospel of Christ. We have laid hands  upon the sick, and the sick have been   healed; devils have been cast out, the   lame have leaped, the deaf have heard,   the dumb have spoken, in this Church  in our day and generation. Can men  go through and experience these things   and not know for themselves whether   the work is of God or not? No. Any   man that has gone forth and adminis-  tered in the ordinance of the house of   God knows that these things are true,   if he has kept the commandments of   God.    Before I sit down I want to say a word   to the Elders of Israel on another sub-  ject. I am called an old man; I guess I   am. I was thinking just now, in speak-  ing of the Apostles and Prophets. that   were with Joseph Smith when he made   his last speech, I am the only man living  that was with him at that time. The   rest are to-day in the spirit world. How   much longer I shall talk to this people  I do not know; but I want to say this to  all Israel: Cease troubling yourselves  about who God is; who Adam is, who   Christ is, who Jehovah is. For heaven's  sake, let these things alone. Why  trouble yourselves about these things?   God has revealed Himself, and when the  121st section of the ##Doctrine and Covenants 121|Doctrine and   Covenants## is fulfilled, whether there be  one God or many gods they will be re-  vealed to the children of men, as well   as all thrones and dominions, princi-  palities, and powers. Then why trouble  yourselves about these things? God is   God. Christ is Christ. The Holy   Ghost is the Holy Ghost. That should   be enough for you and me to know. If  we want to know any more, wait till we  get where God is in person. I say this  because we are troubled every little  while with inquiries from Elders anxious  to know who God is, who Christ is, and  who Adam is. I say to the Elders of  Israel, stop this. Humble yourselves  before the Lord; seek for light, for   truth, and for a knowledge of the com-  mon things of the kingdom of God.  The Lord is the same yesterday, to-day,  and forever. He changes not. The   Son of God is the same. He is the   Savior of the world. He is our advo-  cate with the Father. We have had   letter after letter from Elders abroad  wanting to know concerning these  things. Adam is the first man. He  was placed in the Garden of Eden, and  is our great progenitor. God the  Father, God the Son, and God the  Holy Ghost, are the same yesterday, to-  day and forever. That should be suffi-  cient for us to know.    I pray God to bless these Apostles,   and to bless us all, and to give us wis-  dom and power to magnify our calling  and to do our duty before the Lord,   that we may be prepared to give an  account of our stewardship while dwell-  ing in the flesh. I pray that the Lord   will be merciful to us as a people, and   give those who bear the Priesthood  power to build up Zion and prepare the  way for the coming of the Son of Man,   which may God grant, for Christ's sake. Amen.

The  spirit of God backs up our testimony. I  do not believe myself that any Elder  has ever gone forth into the world to  preach this gospel and been faithful,  borne a faithful testimony to the inhabitants   of the earth to the truth of the Book of   Mormon, and to Joseph Smith being a  prophet of the living God, but what  the Holy Ghost has univerally backed

 21    up that testimony. However ready men may  be to reject the gospel it matters not.  There  has been a testimony borne regarding the  truth of this work from the organization  of the church to the present day, and  when people reject his testimony, whether as  a nation, or a family, or as individuals,  they reject light and truth, their light-  becomes darkness, their darkness overwhelms  them, and they are stirred up to anger as in  former dispensations. Christ said, "And  this is the condemnation that light is come  into the world, and men loved darkness  rather then light, because their deeds were  evil." The woes that were pronouned upon  the Jews and the house of Israel was ^were^  for rejecting the gospel of Jesus Christ

 22    and the ordinances of his house, and the  same will apply to the generation in which  we live.    Now, what is the difference between the  spirit of the Messiah and Elijah? What was  the calling of Jesus Christ? The Saviour held  the Melchesedec Priesthood. He had a right  to administer in all the ordinances of the   house of God in the Aaronic and Melchesedec  Priesthoods. He did so administer. He ordained  and called men to the apostleship. He told  them that they had not called him but  he had called them and ordained them  to go forth as witnesses in his name  in all the world. [##Matthew 10:1##] The Saviour occupied  altogether a different position from any  other man. What was his calling?

Concerning my feelings with regard to this  call I will say, I have not sought for the priv-  ilege of preaching the gospel.

If you choose to call me, please let me know  at once what things in the shape of books, clothing  etc. I will need, as I have but little money to purchase  these things with and will have to make turns  with other things to get the necessities.

However in  accepting such a labor, I shall be compelled  to do so under great financial embarrassments,  as I have been attending school for two years,  and am under obligations for the means thus spent.    This together with a homestead entry that  lacks two years of being completed and the  raising of the means where with to secure some  school land that will soon be in market make  the acceptance doubly hard.    Now Dear Brother if you think it wise  fore me to abandon the land and go under  these circumstances, I am at your command.  If not, as soon as the land is secured I  shall be pleased to accept any labor that  you may require. I should like to know your  wishes in this matter as soon as practicable.    Your Brother John E.

Bro McCracken is very  anxious to go to the Swiss & German Mission  with Brother Smith, and if it meets your approbation  I would suggest that he be given the privilege, as the   boys are both anxious to learn all they possibly can.
