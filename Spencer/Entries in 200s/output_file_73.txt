 9Priesthood in all ages of the world. The spirit of Eliasis manifested in several instances in the gathering of Israel in the last days.Now at the present day we have no ^known^ literaldescendant of Aaron, and hence we have to takeHigh Priests to officiate as Bishops to preside overthis branch of the Aaronic Priesthood. Neverthelessa Priest after the order of Aaron has a right to baptise for the remission of sins; he has a rightto break bread and administer the sacrament;he has a right to officiate in all the ordinancesof the house of God as far as the Levitical Priesthoodextends. The Aaronic Priesthood, however, has nopower to administer the laying on of the hands for thereception of the Holy Ghost; that is an ordinancewhich belongs to the Melchesedec Priesthood, of whichthe Aaronic Priesthood is an appendage or branch. TheAaronic Priesthood has several offices, such as ^Bishops^, Priests,Teachers, & Deacons, and the duties of theseoffices are all made plain in the Book of

The fulness ofthat priesthood with all the keys and powers pertainingto the kingom of God on the earth—to erect temples,to redeem the dead, to administer in all the ordinancesof the temple for the living and the dead, to administerin the Melchesedec Priesthood as Elders, Seventies, HighPriests, Patriarchs, Apostles, and in any and everyoffice which belong to that priesthood.

Thatany man holding the office of an Elder, a Seventy,or a High Priest, a Patriarch, or an Apostle hadthe right, power, and authority to ordain any personto any office in the church and kingdom of Godas high as they held themselves, whether they hadbeen ordained to these Offices^Aaronic Priesthood^ or not, as long asthey held the fulness of the Melchesedec Priesthood.At the same time no man should so ordainwhere there is an organized branch of the Churchonly by the consent of those Presiding over that branch.

 12a Teacher. I was next ordained priest. Itravelled some ten thousand miles, I suppose,or nearly so, while holding the office of a priest.I baptised a great many persons while travellingalone. But while holding that office—the officeof a Priest—I could not confirm, nor didI attempt to, because I had no right, power,or authority, to do so; but an Elder has a rightto do so, a High Priest, or a Seventy, has a rightto lay ^on^ hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost.Now, I wish to say a few words in regardto this principle. Here comes another question,which has been asked me a great many times,and which I will answer according to the viewI have of it. When you conform a man, whatare you to seal upon him—the Gift of theHoly Ghost, or the Holy Ghost? My answer so

Inour conversation, I told you, I had receivedseveral remarkable dreams. You then express-ed a desire to hear them; but circumstancesintervened and seemed to hinder me, at that time.Ever since, at verious times, there has been twospirits at work with me: the one prompting me towrite to you, and the other saying, it is nonsense and folly. I now feel that there can be no harm atleast, and that the Lord brings about good resultsby very small means. As you desired to hear themand of the two promptings, I feel best in writing to you,beleiveing there can be no harm, I write two ofthe shortest ones, because, I beleive, if ertherebe wrong, you can desern it. over

Not but whatthere are some exceptions to this rule. Inthe revelations of God, in making remarks sometimes,the words "the gift of the Holy Ghost" is used. Butthere is a difference, a great difference betweenthe gifts ^Gifts^ of the Holy Ghost, and the Holy Ghost.Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he wasbaptised, but he could not have receivedthe gifts of the Holy Ghost without he had beenbaptised—at least this was the Prophet JosephSmith's doctrine, and it was according to myview of the subject.

 14Holy Ghost—what is it? Why, it is the testimonyof the Father and Son. That testimony goes forthto all the world, and when persons are willingto receive the spirit of God, the testimony of theservants of God, they do receive in a measurethe Holy Ghost, or the spirit of God, to enlightentheir minds. They must be born again beforethey can see the kingdom of God. No mancan see this kingdom unless he is born again,and that, too born of the spirit; but no mancan enter into the kingdom of God without heis born ^both^ of the water and the spirit. Thesethings are very plainly made manifest. Well, what are the gifts of the Holy Ghost? Why,it is speaking in tongues, the interpretation oftongues, healing the sick, casting out devils,raising the dead, opening the eyes of the 
 In the year 1868 my father received his secondanointing, and in about three week he died.About two years afterward, I dreamed fathercame to me while I was in bed, the house waslit up like day: he talked to me for some time,telling, which seems to me, things that were comingto pass, and things which I should do. After hisconversation with me, he went out of the house, andI awoke or come to my self, for it seemed that I hadnot been asleep. There was considerable light inthe house, I arose up and looked out of thewindow and saw the hills and mountains very plainand thought it was day light, as the moon giveno light at that time, as it was near the new moon.I started to dress, when the thought came to me tothink it all over, and I would be better able totell mother, just as it was given me. I placed myelbow on the pillow and my hand over my eyeswhile I thought it over. Then I went to get upand found the room in darkness: it scaredme so, that every thing father had said, was taken fromme.

 15blind &c. The whole catalogue is laid beforeus by the ancient apostles, as well as the apostles of our day and generation. Theseare my views with regard to the difference be-tween the Holy Ghost and the gifts of theHoly Ghost.And this is what I consider the spiritand power of Elijah. Elijah, or the spirit ofElijah, held the keys of the gathering principle,and it has been manifested in every age ofthe world when the Melchesedec priesthood hasbeen amongst the children of men fromthe days of Father Adam down to our day.John the Baptist ordained Joseph Smith to theAaronic Priesthood.

 That every thing he said should be taken from memakes it seem remarkable. About a year after that, I dreamed father came to me, he stood in theair above the ground, I thought it was his spirit.He asked me if I would finish his house, Hethen invited me to come and see what needed to be done.I went with him, and saw a large frame buildingstanding on a solid rock foundation, but it neededthe shingles, weather boarding, windows and doors.He asked me if I would finish it. I told Him Iwould. He then said:  "I am going away to begone a long time before I come again to talk to you." He than started up into heaven andcontinued untill he went out of my sight.I then awoke and found it to be a dream.It has now been about Twenty Five yearssince, and ^I^ have had no talk with him, in dream,which makes it seem the more remarkable.I dreamed a short time ago of receiving a letterfrom him. handed to me by my mother. she diedover

 I ask and desire this morning thefaith and prayers of the Latter-day Saints in my behalf while I stand before you. This is not merely an idle cere-mony, for if I possessed all the oratory and learning of the ancient Greeks andRomans it would not give me power to edify one immortal spirit in the children of men or to point any immortal soul tothe way of salvation. I am entirely de-pendent upon the Lord. I always havebeen during my life, and in my travels and pilgrimage, preaching the Gospel of Christ to my fellow men.  It does not make any difference what age a man is in the preaching of the Gospel, whether he be twenty-five, ninety or five hun-dred years of age, if he is only inspired by the Spirit and power of God. Many of the ancients lived to a very greatage. Father Adam up to the last speech he ever made to his children, according to the revelations of God, was filled with the Holy Ghost, and he was nearly a thousand years of age.I have some things upon my mind I would like to present to the Latter-daySaints if I can get the spirit of them. I think it would be profitable to us to spend a little time in reflecting andmeditating upon the powers that be--the powers that exist to-day on the earth and have existed from eternity unto eternity-- good and evil, light and dark-ness, Christ and Belial, or Lucifer, theson of the morning. When we look over the history of the world we can see from the creation of Father Adam down to our day the operation of thesetwo powers. And these powers will exist until the end of time, and from that time henceforth, until there is a change in the destiny of the spirits of men. It seems that from the time of the great rebellion in heaven, when one-third of the hosts of heaven were cast down for their rebellion against the great Eloheim and Jehovah, the Creator of heaven and earth, therehas been a warfare against God, against Christ, against His Church, against His Priesthood, and against everything thatwould tend to salvation and eternal life.And in looking over the history of the world, from the revelations of God tous, we can see in the peopling of the earth and in the building up of cities by the inhabitants of the earth, the powers of evil, of darkness, and of sin have had great control over the children of men. Men were led to sin and to do evil until those ancient cities, like modern ones, were filled with iniquity. The Lord raised up prophets and inspired men in all those dispensations, when cities and nations became ripened into iniquity, togive them commandments, to warn themof the judgments of God, and to tell them what to do to escape those judg-ments. And when these cities and na-tions were fully ripened in iniquity and would not repent, all that those proph-ets proclaimed unto them came to pass. You may take all the ancient cities--Thebes, Nineveh, Tyre, Sidon, Babylon, Jerusalem, and others--and they hadprophets raised up among them. They were warned of God, and were toldwhat awaited them unless they repented of their sins, and all came to pass as the prophets spake unto them. My mind rests upon Jeremiah. The Lord called him in his day to go and warn King Zedekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusa-lem, and the prophet told them what would come to pass. The king and theinhabitants were wroth against him and they persecuted him, and he had somany trials to go through that a man in reading of them would not be surprised if Jeremiah felt like saying, "You may all go to destruction for what I care; I'm not going to stay with you." But the Lord had said unto Jeremiah, "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of thewomb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations." Allthat Jeremiah said to the inhabitants ofJerusalem came to pass, and the historyof Jerusalem is terrible. The whole house of Israel had warning; prophets were raised up among them, and they prophesied unto them. All the judg-ments that visited them were foretold.I speak of these things because they are on my mind, and we are in a some-what similar condition ourselves. Takethe days of Christ.  As soon as Christ was born how quickly Herod soughtHis life! Joseph had to take Mary and the young child into Egypt in order to save the child. The power of evil wasafter Him for His destruction. And did the Savior, when He was grown to manhood, escape that power? Was there anything about Him in this re-spect that differed from others of thehuman family? There was not. He was tempted, He was tried, and the enemy labored for His destruction through His whole life. His mission was a short one. It was only three and a half years from the time he en-tered into the Priesthood until He was crucified, and that, too, by this power. And the sorrow that has come upon the Jewish nation in consequence of this act of theirs, and the bill that they have had to pay, has been indeed great, and all that the prophets said concerning that has come to pass to the very letter.Nearly nineteen hundred years have rolled around since the death of Christ, and that yoke has been upon the neck of the Jews from that day until this. Theyhave been trampled under the foot of the Gentiles, in fulfilment of the words of the prophets of God, and because they shed the blood of the Savior, theirShiloh. And it has not yet come to an end with them.John, while upon the Isle of Patmos, clothed with the glory of God and wrapt in the visions of heaven, por-trayed, prophesied, and wrote concern-ing the events that should take place down to the coming of the Son of Man. He told us concerning the restoration of the everlasting Gospel. He says:And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth.Saying with a loud voice, Fear God and giveglory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come.That has come to pass. The time has come when the Lord has set His hand to fulfil the flood of revelation contained in all the records of divine truth. The Lord raised up a man, ordained andprepared from the foundation of the world, to stand in the last dispensation and fulness of times, to receive the Gos-pel and the Priesthood, to organize the Church of God, and to prepare the wayfor the coming of the Son of Man. We know that these two powers were mani-fested with the Prophet Joseph as they were in the days of the Savior. The very moment that he received these revelations from God and proclaimed them, it seemed as though all earth andhell were let loose for his destruction. It appeared as if the devil was afraidthat he would live to carry out these prophecies. You know his history. Some of us have been associated with that Prophet. We have seen this spirit ofthe evil one manifested.  The Prophet Joseph was never let alone by the pow-ers that exist until he, like the Saviorand others, sealed his testimony withhis blood. But during the short timethat he dwelt in the flesh he accom-plished all that he was ordained to do. He not only organized the Church, but he brought forth this book of revela-tions that I hold in my hand-- the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, which con-tains some of the most sublime revela-tions God ever revealed to man on the earth. The Lord also chose Twelve Apostles, High Priests, Elders, Priests,Teachers, and Deacons, and set in order the whole organization of the Church of

 578  THE DESERET WEEKLY.God as it exists today.  And what has been the consequence of this? I desire to bring the minds of the brethren to those days.  Just as quick as the Twelve Apostles were appointed and the Church was set in order, the devil labored with all the power that he possessed to turn aside these men and inspire them toleave the Church of God. Because of this it seemed to be very hard work many times for men who had received the Priesthood and even the Apostleshipto magnify that Priesthood and to stand in their calling until they could finish their work in the flesh. I have made a re-mark once or twice in my teachings with regard to the great apostasy in Kirtland. I passed through that scene, as did some others who are now with us, and I wish now to refer to it because it issomething we should lay to heart. Even Apostles took occasion to rise up and endeavored to dictate and direct the Prophet of God. Here, brethren andsisters, was a manifestation-- and a very strange one, too-- of the power that thedevil had over the leading men whom God raised up to assist in laying thefoundation of this Church and in bring-ing forth the Book of Mormon. Those who testified to the Book of Mormonwere led away through not keeping thecommandments of God and thinkingthat they themselves were great men.Some of them were learned men; someof them considered themselves verysmart men, and they were so smart that they wanted to dictate and direct theProphet of God. The consequence ofall this was that they turned asidefrom the commandments of God. Some ofthem had been true and faithful in theirlabors in the ministry. I have heardOliver Cowdery testify of the Book of Mormon by the power of God, when it seemed as if the very earth trembledunder his feet. He was filled with the Holy Ghost and the power of God while he was faithful; and so were many of these men. But Oliver Cowdery yielded to the temptation of the evil one,and we may say he apostatized. So didMartin Harris, and several others con=nected with them. They left the Church, they turned against Joseph, andthey said he was a fallen prophet, andthey themselves wanted to direct theChurch. I have remarked that therewas a time when there were but twoof the quorum of the Twelve Apostles then in the town of Kirtland who stood by Joseph Smith and upheld him as aProphet, Seer, and Revelator. I was not amember of that quorum at that time; I was a Seventy. Several of these mencalled upon me in the time of this apos=tasy and asked me to join them against the Prophet; the Prophet was fallen,they said. Now, I had seen enough myself of the Prophet of God, and Ihad read enough of the revelations of Godthrough him, to know that he was a Prophet of God and not a fallen prophet.I saw that these men were yielding to the devil, and I told them so. Said I:"You will all go to hell unless yourepent. Joseph has been raised up by the power of God; he has organized thisChurch, he has been true and faithful to God and to the Church and kingdom of God here on the earth, and you will falland go to perdition unless you repentof your sins and turn from the position you are in to-day." A good many ofthem did fall. I will here name oneinstance. I saw one of these Apostles in the Kirtland Temple, while the Sacr-ament was being passed, stand in theaisle and curse the Prophet of God to hisface while he was in the stand, andwhen the bread was passed hereached out his hand for a piece of breadand flung it into his mouth like a maddog. He turned as black in the facealmost as an African with rage and with the power of the devil. What did hedo? He ate and drank damnation tohimself. He did not go and hang him-self; but he did go and drown himself,and the river went over his body whilehis spirit was cast into the pit, where heceased to have the power to curse eitherGod or His Prophet in time or in etern-ity. [note in CD: The only Apostle fitting President Woodruff's description was Lyman Eugene Johnson, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from 1835 to 1838, who was disfellowshipped during a conference held in Kirtland, 3 September 1837. After making appropriate confessions, he was restored to his original position a few days later. Johnson was, however, excommunicated at Far West, Mo., on 13 April 1838. He drowned in the Mississippi river at Prairie du Chien, Wis., 20 December 1856.] I may say that David Patten wasnot in Kirtland at this time; he was in Missouri. He never apostatized, butdied a martyr.Brethren and sisters, I have passedthrough these scenes, and it was a serious time. And I will tell you thedevil is not dead to-day, but will war against us and against this Church, asfar as he has power, while we dwell in the flesh. I thank the Lord, however, that I know for myself that this Church will stand, and the Lord will bear it off triumphant. We have passed those days of affliction and sorrow; but I wantto say to my brethren, one and all, westill have got to watch unto prayer. If there is any place where the devil canlead us astray he will do it. We are notsafe until we get through with this pro-bation. I thank God for one thing:I am satisfied for myself that those daysare passed and gone. There is no man in heaven or on earth will ever live to see such a day again. We are too nearthe end; we are too near the coming of the Son of Man. The Lord Almightyhas called a class of men upon whoseshoulders he has laid the responsibilityfor this great work. He has chosen the weak things of the world, and we havethese responsibilities resting upon us.I am satisfied for myself that the ser-vants of God whom He has chosen will, as a rule, be true and faithful unto death. How dark a man must be in hismind to get into such a condition asthese Apostles were. I heard some ofthem bear testimony before God, angelsand men that they had received the ministration of angels, and having thatknowledge, what a condition they musthave been in when they apostatized! We want to guard ourselves with regard to these matters. We have gotto look to the Lord to assist us in thecause in which we are engaged. I hopeand pray that I may live to see the per-fect union of the Twelve Apostles with the Presidency of this Church andthe union of the whole Church. Wehave this work upon our shoulders andthe Lord is watching over us. I will sayto all the nations of the earth, you can-not turn aside or overthrow the designsof the Lord; they will come to passin the earth exactly as they have beenpromised to the children of men.We are here upon a mission, and it is a great mission. We are blessed in living in this day and generation. We ought to try and make the most of it we can. We ought to try and improve ourtime, magnify our calling, and do ourduty. I will say to the Latter-day Saints, the Lord has called and chosen us to stand as the leaders of the people---the Presidency, the Twelve Apostlesand the various quorums and positionswhich we are in, and we are responsibleto God for the course we pursue inthese matters. True, we need the faithand fellowship of the Saints; we need their assistance; but inasmuch as we doour duty the blessings of God will bewith us. I know for myself that the Lord has set His hand to carry out Hisgreat purposes and prepare the way forthe coming of the Son of Man. We havepassed through a long period of time, as men count time, in our history. I will here refer to one incident:  When Christ and Peter, James and John went into the mount, Moses and Elias were mani-fest to them, and Jesus was transfigured before them. The last time the Apostlesever met with the Prophet Joseph Smith, there were eleven of us present,--nine Apostles, himself and his brother Hyrum. He likewise was transfigured before us, as far as mortal man can be.The room which he was in was filled aswith consuming fire by the power of God. His face was clear as amber, he was clothed with the power of God. We did not know he was going to leaveus any more than the Apostles knew the Savior was going to leave them inthat day. But he told us what our duties were. He laid before us whatGod required at his hands and the or-dinances unto which he had beenordained by the power of God. Hesaid the Lord had sealed upon his headevery ordinance, every key and every power belonging to this dispen-sation of the fulness of times; and,he added, "I have sealed these things upon your heads; now you must go forthand bear off this kingdom or you will be damned." That was a very strongremark to us. I have never forgotten it from that day to this. I realize that God was with him. And He has beenwith His people. He is with Zion to-day. He will continue to be. Thoughall the powers of darkness may war against us, the Lord is our Friend and He will sustain us and give us power tobuild up Zion and to carry out thiswork until the coming of the Sonof Man. Therefore, let your hearts becomforted. These Apostles, I amsatisfied, are of one heart and mind.I know they are united with us; I knowwe are united with them. This is agreat joy and consolation to me. Weall should be united in the cause inwhich we are engaged. Inasmuch as wedo this we shall come off triumphant.I have no fear about Zion; I never had.It is written, as with a pen upon a rock, and is the voice of God, that Zion shallstand. All the prophecies that the Lordhas given as contained in the Bible,the Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants will be fulfilled to the very letter. Not one jot or one tittlewill fall unfulfilled. Zion will arise and flourish, and the glory of God will restupon her. When I cast my mind over the signs of the times, when I look atthe fulfilment of prophecy and observe what is taking place in the earth I seethe hand of God manifest and the fulfil=ment of prophecy and revelation.These angels of God that have been standing in the temples of heavenholding sharp sickles day after day plead-ing with God to let them go forth to reap down the earth have been com-manded of the Lord to wait until the wheat was gathered into the garner, and then they might go forth and reap downthe earth. If the world wants to knowwhat is coming to pass, let them readthe Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants; let them read these revelations of St. John. As God lives they will come to pass. Not one of them will fall unfulfilled. And the

 19and very simple in every generation when thegospel has been offered to the world.Well, now, what is the difference betweenthe saints of God and the world? The saints ofGod have  received the gospel, they see the powerof the gospel, their eyes are open to see, theirears to hear, and their hearts to understand.They are not only born of the spirit, butborn of the water. They can enter into thekingdom of God. They have had hands laidupon them by those having ^power and^ authority tobestow the Holy Ghost. No man haspower in and of himself to bestow theHoly Ghost or any other gift or graceupon the children of men. We cannot inand of ourselves lay hands upon thesick to heal them, or to cast out devils,

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  579hand of God is beginning to be man-ifest in the earth. Judgment is at thedoor; calamity awaits the nations of theearth; but we ourselves should be pre-pared to stand in holy places while thejudgments of God are manifest in the earth.Now, brethren and sisters, let us behumble before the Lord; let us remem-ber our prayers; let us try to do our duty; and when we do this. the blessingsof God will be with us. I felt yester-day that I wished I could see all the young men in Israel before Brother J. E. Talmage while he spoke to us for half an hour (it ought to have been twohours) on the evil of this tobacco busi-ness. We should let alone all theseevils, and our children should also, thatthey might be prepared to go forth asholy vessels and servants of God tobear record of this Gospel.  We arenot yet through preaching the Gospel.We send our sons abroad, and many ofthem go before they know whether this isthe Church of God or not. I need not stand up here and testify before this congregation that this is the Church of God on the earth. Thousands of you haveknow that for yourselves. You have been abroad; I have been abroad; theseApostles have been abroad; and we have administered the ordinances of theGospel of Christ. We have laid handsupon the sick, and the sick have been healed; devils have been cast out, the lame have leaped, the deaf have heard, the dumb have spoken, in this Churchin our day and generation. Can mengo through and experience these things and not know for themselves whether the work is of God or not? No. Any man that has gone forth and adminis-tered in the ordinance of the house of God knows that these things are true, if he has kept the commandments of God.Before I sit down I want to say a word to the Elders of Israel on another sub-ject. I am called an old man; I guess I am. I was thinking just now, in speak-ing of the Apostles and Prophets. that were with Joseph Smith when he made his last speech, I am the only man livingthat was with him at that time. The rest are to-day in the spirit world. How much longer I shall talk to this peopleI do not know; but I want to say this toall Israel: Cease troubling yourselvesabout who God is; who Adam is, who Christ is, who Jehovah is. For heaven'ssake, let these things alone. Whytrouble yourselves about these things? God has revealed Himself, and when the121st section of the ##Doctrine and Covenants 121|Doctrine and Covenants## is fulfilled, whether there beone God or many gods they will be re-vealed to the children of men, as well as all thrones and dominions, princi-palities, and powers. Then why troubleyourselves about these things? God is God. Christ is Christ. The Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost. That should be enough for you and me to know. Ifwe want to know any more, wait till weget where God is in person. I say thisbecause we are troubled every littlewhile with inquiries from Elders anxiousto know who God is, who Christ is, andwho Adam is. I say to the Elders ofIsrael, stop this. Humble yourselvesbefore the Lord; seek for light, for truth, and for a knowledge of the com-mon things of the kingdom of God.The Lord is the same yesterday, to-day,and forever. He changes not. The Son of God is the same. He is the Savior of the world. He is our advo-cate with the Father. We have had letter after letter from Elders abroadwanting to know concerning thesethings. Adam is the first man. Hewas placed in the Garden of Eden, andis our great progenitor. God theFather, God the Son, and God theHoly Ghost, are the same yesterday, to-day and forever. That should be suffi-cient for us to know.I pray God to bless these Apostles, and to bless us all, and to give us wis-dom and power to magnify our callingand to do our duty before the Lord, that we may be prepared to give anaccount of our stewardship while dwell-ing in the flesh. I pray that the Lord will be merciful to us as a people, and give those who bear the Priesthoodpower to build up Zion and prepare theway for the coming of the Son of Man, which may God grant, for Christ's sake. Amen.

Therehas been a testimony borne regarding thetruth of this work from the organizationof the church to the present day, andwhen people reject his testimony, whether asa nation, or a family, or as individuals,they reject light and truth, their light-becomes darkness, their darkness overwhelmsthem, and they are stirred up to anger as informer dispensations. Christ said, "Andthis is the condemnation that light is comeinto the world, and men loved darknessrather then light, because their deeds wereevil."

What wasthe calling of Jesus Christ? The Saviour heldthe Melchesedec Priesthood. He had a rightto administer in all the ordinances of the house of God in the Aaronic and MelchesedecPriesthoods. He did so administer. He ordainedand called men to the apostleship. He toldthem that they had not called him buthe had called them and ordained themto go forth as witnesses in his namein all the world.

Then hismission will be closed, as far as the redemption ofworld is concerned.Now, we as Latter-day-Saints are calledto build these temples.

 and stated that he is now ready to go on hismission any time you desire him to go, either toEngland, the Northern States or to Montana. Hehas some relatives in Montana who has learnedthat he has been preparing for a mission that arebegging him to come out into Montana, as the people want to hear our doctrines explained to their understanding.Brother Thornley is very well versed in the scripturesand understands the Gospel far better than most young men, he has been a teacher in our Sunday Schoolfor years, and I never knew him fail to be present.I appointed him to take charge of two Deacons Quorums, and he had those quorums so welltrained in the Gospel, that I have gone and askedthem many questions upon the Gospel and they would answer as readily as an inteligent Elderor Seventy. Bro Thornley is a very quiet unassumingman, good even temper & I think would do a goodwork in Montana if sent there, but is perfectly willingto go anywhere he is sent.Please answer & let me know if Bro's Smith& McCracken can be allowed till June next to finish theirschool term & prepare for their mission & obligeYour Bro in the GospelGeo L.

Children cannotbe sealed to parents, nor parents to children without a temple. ^No man can receive an eternal inheritance without a Temple^ There are many thingsGod has permitted ^to be done^ without a temple ^until temples could be built^ suchas the baptising and sealing ordinancesuntil we could get a temple built; butthese ordinances all belong to the templeof God. I consider myself that this isa branch of the work that the Lord requiresof us as Latter-day-Saints to go to andmake a beginning for the redemptionof our dead as far as we have opportunity;and my faith is that we as Latter-day-Saints will magnify our calling,
