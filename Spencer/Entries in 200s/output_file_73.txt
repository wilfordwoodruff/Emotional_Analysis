DEAR BRETHREN:  I am instructed by the First Council of Seventies to forward  to you the enclosed communication from the 24th Quorum of Seventies. The  Council desire to know what answer they shall make. The difficulty in the  case arises from the statement that the Bishop has been instructed not to endorse the names of brethren suggested as missionaries, unless they can  give written guarantee that neither they nor their families will require assistance during their absence.  The Council desire me to ask if such are the instructions to Bishiops.  Very Truly Your Brother,  John M. Whitaker. General Secretary.

Hitherto, letters were addressed to W. W.

Goddard's writing, about the banners, and I answered him to the best of my knowledge. I addressed all to him, knowing he would faithfully distribute them to the proper persons.  But your letter to me, gave me as much pleasure, as I fancy you enjoyed, when the angel first appeared to you, to give you the necessary information to superintend the ordinances for the living and the dead.  This morning I went over to bro. Williams, to arrange to give a ton of coal to the first man with a Horse team, who will carry me, banner and to Salt Lake City. George Goddard being in the Bishop's Office, may know of a Horse team coming out here, on Monday 19th for a load of coal on tithing who will take me with him to the city, and he will get his ton of coal, at the Mine, without costing him any thing.  I have also got the first Buckskin Coat made in the Valley in August 1847 which I will bring in, as a contrast to the clothing of 1880, that will require a straight stick 6 or 7 feet long, with a cross piece for the arms. If the Painters would print a slip "the first coat made by the Pioneers, in Salt Lake Valley, August 1847," to paste on the Coat, will preach a service in a very few words.

Ashman several letters and a telegram in relation to the disgraceful charges preferred against Orlando Warner, concerning which bro. Geo. A. has also received a letter from you. So far as we can learn the excitement against Judge King is in consequence of his having admitted Warner to bail, and whether the Judge accepted an illegal bond or admitted Warner on his own recognisance has not transpired. That Judge King would have the right to admit Warner to bail to a regular term of court by taking ample security is established by precedent. The bail would necessarily have to be high because in chap. 22, Sec. 16, of laws of Utah the pun- ishment for such a crime is imprisonment for life or not less than ten years. We would regard a bond for $3000.00 executed in proper form, conditioned for the peaceful demeanor of the accused as well as his appearance at court to answer as sufficient. Art. 4 of the amendments to the Constitution says: Excessive bail shall not be required.

March 28, 1887.  Elder Heber J. Grant  Dear Brother:  You asked me a question the last time we met ehich I was not prepared to answer at the time it was given. I have gibven the subject some thought and reflection and I now feel prepared to answer the question according to my views. You asked me if I knew any reason in case of the death of the President of the Church why the Twelve Apostles should not choose some other person to be the President of the Church instead of the Twelve President of the Twelve Apostles. I think I do know of several good sound reasons which I will now give you. In the first place there are two or three plain truths which are eternal, everlasting, un- changeable, and immovable as the pillars of heaven (as far as this dispensation is concerned) which have been established by the revelation of God through the mouth of the Prophet Joseph Smith. These truths stare us in the face. First, when the President of the Church dies, who then is the presiding authority of the Church? It is the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (ordained and organized by the revelations of God and none else). Then while these Twelve Apostles preside over the Church, who is the President of the Church? It is the President of the Twelve Apostles. And he is virtually as much the President of the Church while presiding over Twelve men as he is when organized into the Presidency of the Church and presid- ing over two men. And this principle has been carried out now for 57 years, ever since the organization of the Church. When Joseph Smith the Prophet was martyred, the Twelve Apostles stepped forth as the presiding authority of the Church, as ordained of God, with Brigham Young at their head to preside over the Church and direct its affairs. And when the Twelve Apostles came to organize the First Presidency, which of the Twelve stepped forth to claim the right to preside over Brigham Young? Not one, nor any other man except Sidney Rigdon, an apostate. Why did Brigham Young claim the right of the Presidency? Because he was the President of the Church while presiding over Twelve men as two men. When President Young died who was the presiding authority of the Church? The Twelve Apostles and none else. And who was the President of the  Church? John Taylor. Why? Because he was the President of the Twelve Apostles. And when the Twelve Apostles came to organize the First Presidency again, which of the Twelve Apostles was moved upon to claim the right to preside over the Church above John Taylor? Such a thing did enter into the heart of one of the Twelve Apostles, nor any other man, except Daniel H. Wlells, and he said he had a revelation that Joseph F.

Dear Sir—As brother Bigler is about to return home, I feel to write a few lines, and give what news we have. I call upon the President daily. We have no Eastern mail yet. We were quite interested in Cradlebaugh's charge to the Grand Jury, and in his bodyguard, but I think he has done like Sinclair, shot his biggest gun first. The Indian that went after the nine  horses stolen at Grantsville, has returned with two of them, the others  were killed. He says he travelled 200 miles, got to camp, told his business, and they said they would kill him for being a traitor. They brought up three horses left, and then shot down a stud be- longing to bishop Clark, and dried the meat, and tied the other two up. In the night the Indian crawled out, took the two horses which were left, fled for Grantsville and got in safe. He was followed by a band who went to Kimball's herd, some 170, with his wildcat stud, and tried to drive them to the main land, on the west side of the island. When they were belly deep in  water, they stampeded, went back to the island, fled into the mountains, and the Indians got none of them. There is now a guard there.  (Private. When Dr. Forney's interpreter, Jebow, talked with the Indians at Grantsville, he told them they must not steal any horses or mules with U. S. on them, and that if they did the soldiers would follow them and kill them. He conveyed the idea that they must steal Mormon animals, if any.

So, with the blessings of a God that never errs nor "lies," I hope and pray for a time of greater perfection when the great day of grog mouthed, pistol- fisted, bum-shell-bodied, gold eyed gentiles, and their snake fanged allies, the mormon apostates, will be whistling the Devils Reel round a coal-pit barbacue of skunks, roasting in brimstone and devils-dung for the "last supper of the damn'd; after ENDENTRY may possibly interest your people.

If the President of the Twelve Apostles is not fit to be the President of the Church, he is not fit to be the President of the Twelve Apostles. Again, there is another eternal truth stares me in the face. In case of the death of the President of the Church, Brother George Q. Cannon, Wilford Woodruff, the President of the Twelve (whoever he may be); notr any six Apostles combined have not power to appoint a president for the Church. And as far as the appointment of John Taylor was concerned, there never has been a dissenting voice with the Twelve Apostles. And I certainly do not believe, should President Taylor die today, that Brother George Q. Cannon nor any other man could use influence or argument enough to convert a majority of the Twelve Apostles to depart from the beaten track laid out and followed by the inspira- tion of Almighty God for the last 57 years by the Apostles as re- corded in the history of the Church. As far as I am concerned it would require not only a much stronger argument than I ever heard, but a revelation from the same God who had organized the church and guided it by inspiration in the channel in which it has traveled for 57 years, before I could give my vote or influence to depart from the paths followed by the Apostles since the organization of the Church. Again, Presidents John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff are the only two men now living in the flesh who listened to the words and charge of Joseph Smith the Prophet to the Twelve Apostles before his death when he said, "Brethren, I have had sorrow of heart for fear I might be taken away with the keys of the Kingdom ogf God upon me before I sealed them upon the heads of other men. But I thank God I have lived to see the day when I have had power to give the Twelve Apostles their endowlments. And I have now sealed upon your heads all the keys of the kingdom of God and the powers of the Holy Priesthood, which God has sealed upon me. And now I roll off the labor and work of the Church and kindgom of God upon the shoulders of the Twelve Apostles. And I now command you in the name of Jesus Christ to round up your shoulders and bear off this church and Kingdom of God on the earth before heaven and earth, and before God, angels, and men, and if you do not do it you will be damned." Now brother Grant, with this declaration and charge ringing in my ears, should I outlive President Taylor (an event I never expect to see) I should strongly urge my brethren of the Twelve Apostles to follow the beaten track marked out and followed by the prophets and apos- tles for the last fifty seven years. And I have full confidence to believe that the Twelve Apostles hadve had experience and light enough to shun any path pointed out to gratify the private inter- est or any man or  set or men against the interest of the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth. I once knew not only twelve men but twice twelve leading men of the church undertake to appoint a prophet and president of the Church before the death of the Prophet Joseph, but they apostatized and went to perdition. And it would be a very dangerous precedent for us to set to depart from the order which God has pointed out. And it will be a precedent which the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles will never set from this time unto the coming of the Son of Man. I was informed that president George Q. Cannon used the argument in the deeding of the Gardo House to President Taylor as the president of the Church, that in case of his death the deed should not go to the president of the Twelve Apostles, but to the president whom the Twelve Apostles should appoint (I certainly have no objection to that) saying that in the ENDENTRY for a moment such wickedness it would require a great deal of coolness on their part to await the tardy operations of the law.

He says he has been trying to pray for the court there, but does not have much of the spirit of prayer for them.  Yours truly W. Woodruff ENDENTRY appointment of John Taylor it so happened in those instances that the president of the Twelve Apostles was appointed President, but it did not follow that that principle would be followed out hereafter. And the argument was used to sustain it that Elder Woodruff prophesied at a Conference at Ogden that Joseph F. Smith would yet become president of the Church, and we would have to deviate from the usual course in order to have that fulfilled. Now if Elder Woodruff delivered such a prophecy by the inspiration of the Lord (which I firmly believe he did) it will be fulfilled as sure as fate, and that too without deviating from the path marked out by the Lord, and followed by the leaders of the Church. It was said that that prophecy was recorded. I will also make a statement, that I, Wilford Woodruff, heard Heber C. Kimball and BPresident Joseph Smith say in  their presence and in the presence of others in 1832, the first time that Joseph Smith ever had an interview with Brigham Young, he said Brigham Young would yet be the President of the Churlch, and that was four years before there were any Twelve Apostles chosen, and no man knew that Brigham Young would ever be an Apostle (unless God revealed it to the Prophet). And still, after sixteen years of revelation and change, Brigha, Young was president of the Church, without turning to the right or left from the path marked out by the revelation of God. And that prophecy is alrso recorded. And there was not one chance in ten for that to be fulfilled that there is for Joseph F. Smith to be president of the Church in the regular channel of the order of God.  Now Brother Grant, I have given you my reasons for be- lieving that in case of the death of the President of the Church, it is the right of the president of the Twelve Apostles to become the President of the Church, and that the majority of the Twelve Apostles will so decide until the coming of the Son of Man. Now Brother Grant if you have any arguments or light outside of what I have presented as a path for the Twelve Apostles to walk in differ- ent from what we have followed as a Church, and will forward it to me, I will give it an investigation. But I will confess I do not know the reason why Brother George Q. Cannon has brought this sub- ject up and made it a matter of conversation several times since the appointment of President Taylor to the Presidency, or that he should depart from the principles he so strongly advocated in the appoint- ment of President Taylor. I see no reason why we should be so anxious to fix up vbridges to cross over, that we may never see in this life. (It is a bridge I never expect to cross, for I do not expect to outlive the President of the Church.) And I think we all have sufficient business on hand to attend to without troubling ourselves about affairs we may never see. Of course President Taylor, like all other men, will die some time. When that day scomes it will be quite time enough for the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to attend to organization of the Presidency of the Church.  I will keep a copy of this communication.  I remain your Brother in the Gospel of Christ,  WILFORD WOODRUFF. ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Nov. 25/1887  John Bushman  Dear Brother, I received your letter of Nov. 18 1887.

I was encamped on the Gila River about four five below where the Indians killed Thurston, on the night of his death. The Party that killed him was undoubtedly from the San Carlos Reservation for we saw signs all along from that place and were standing guard nights to guard against an attack from the Apaches. On our way through the Reservation we had a very good chance to observe the Character of the Natives. Traveling down the San Carlos River to its mouth where the Govt Post is situated, we encountered a great many Apache Farmers nearly all having good 3 nich farm wagons and good teams and harness.

Moraly they are in a low filthy condition the soldiers and freighters in that country are demoralizing nearly all of the women along the road through the reservation. The Indians on this (the San Carlos) reservation number about 5,000, all told. They claim that they are not in sympathy with the Hostiles But I think without a doubt they and them to some extent. The number of  Hostiles on the war path is not known a great many of the Scouts that were discharged have not returned to the reservation and it is supposed they have joined the hostiles. a great deal of damage has been done by them and the soldiers have made very little headway in capturing them The Indians have a very rough country to fight in and it is almost impossible to get at them to fight them for they are like the Sons of Heleman they run and never tire, and can subsist on what a soldier would starve to death on.

The winter has continued up to this time, with good sleighing, though the snow has thawed some for several days. Cattle on the west range are suffering a good deal. I have brought home most of mine that I could find. Charles, some 14 years old, was buried yesterday. Sick two weeks. Attended by Dr. Bernhisel. Lung and brain fever. President Young preached at the funeral, and was much affected. I reported the address in my journal. On the night of January 30, Hiram Kimball, jun., with several other young men, had Anne  Rose in a sleigh, running a race with another sleigh. Kimball's  sleigh turned over and flung the girls on the ice, nearly killing Miss Rose, nearly broke her head. She was insensible until this morning. She is some better. Hiram Kimball's  head was bruised badly. A young man of Feramors Little's  was killed in Big Cottonwood Kanyon, by a snow slide, on the 28th ult., while opening a road through the snow.

Tithing is falling off as it always does in the fall of the year besides many good tith payers have emigrated to Utah this season. Very little tithing reaches this office it is mostly used by the Conference presidents to pay rents for Stalls and Conference houses.  Some of the best missionaries we have are the poorest, and we have helped them alittle, by way of loan, and kept them from going hungry and naked. The question presented itself in this wise; assist, or release and send home. and I felt we could not spare them; ^and^ probably not more than half a dozen have, or rather are now receiving assistance in this wise. This climate is harder on the elders, it seems to me, every year, and the people are more in different to the gospel.

It seems you find much snow south. The President met with the bishops last night to make arrangements for raising the ox-teams  in this city to send east. I think the President wishes the city ^people^ to raise at least 200 yoke of cattle in this city. He is getting out a circular for the Bishops. Concerning the news from the east, I will say there is a Gentile company formed, who get some 15 pages telegraphic dispatches from Kearney, through Cronyn. The Saints have also formed a company for the same purpose—Smoot, andc., who get the news from the Gentile Company, until their comes direct from Kearney. Last week they had some fifteen pages, a synopsis of which you will find in the D. News of Jan. 30, and the extra of to- day. But a small portion is published. Last week's Mountain- eer extra we sent to you at Parowan. Our mails will only  come now twice a month, and the pony once a week. The last pony got in last night direct to ^from^ Kearney, and brought 22 pages of tele- graphic despatches, due on tissue paper, which was taken into President office and all copied. I have just heard it read. It contains news from all the eastern states up to Jany. 22. Also a  letter from Cap. Hooper, containing printed scraps up to Jany. 12. The following is a key to the whole matter. Six states have seceeded, including Georgia, and ^nearly^ all their delegation from ^to^ both houses of Congress have resigned and withdrawn, and the other slave states ENDENTRY applicable to Demorcracy also in my opinion. It is a source of sorrow to all who love the truth and fair play, to witness the efforts, of otherwise reasonable men, to cram others with their peculiar political bias. Passeing the Priesthood of the son of God our plane and orbit is superior to the ordinary or extreordinary political trickster; and we can no more resort to their level in politics than ^we can^ to their Confusion in religion. Those sweet delicate wispering of the holy spirit must be preserved on the sturup as well as in the pulpit.  There is another subject whish engrosses my thoughts at times vis: the tearing to pecies of our pe-Edmund-law fami- ly relations. If the spirit has given me the right under- standing, the Presidency have not counselled the putting a- way ^of^ a portion of our wives and advised polygamists to take their first wives to their bosoms and live with them and none others. I look upon the family relation in the same light ^that^ I look upon the church, which is a sympathetic body and when 5% suffered, 95% suffered also; where one member is afflicted all suffer alike. I can say to my wives we will obey the law, but I would not feel justified to say to five senventh of my fam, you must go into outer darkness ^and live^ while I enjoy all the ^light^ law allows me with one wife; rather all suffer together and present an actual living protest to the inhumanity of Congress which has essayed to break in peices those family ties which are stronger than death. Where is the first wife who feels to accept an ^this^ advantage accorded by this illegible ^great^ wrong to many of her tried sisters? I pray that, there is not one wo- man in all Israel who joys in the downfall ^misery^ of her sisters. My feelings are to day that I would much rather endure the Consequences of living ^openly^ with my wives Lizzie ^so far as the law alone is concerned^ than to live with either one of them and then do violence to my conscience.

Memphis is build- ing a battery of 24 heavy guns. Louisiana has forbidden the entrance of any American shipping into the mouth of the Mississippi. All pilots are forbidden to take in any U. S. shipping. The Alabama Legislature makes pilots liable to fine and imprisonment who may bring vessels into the harbor of Mobile, and authorizes the commander of Fort Morgan to destroy the beacon and landmarks at his discretion. The U. S. troops have concentrated all their force into one strong fort in Florida, I think; the rest are in the hands of the seceeders. Most of the southern states are arming as fast as possible. Kentucky has sent word to the President, that if any troops are sent to take posses- sion of any of the southern forts, she shall secede, and join the south. All the sout slave states are now leaning that way.

Brother Ilas.  Dear Sir,  I received your kind letter of March 6th, and was truly glad to get a long letter from you, and to have you express your feelings freely upon any matter you wished. I have much I would like to say upon both spiritual and tem- poral subjects, had I time, room, and opportunity. But it is such a difficult matter to treat upon religious subjects with paper and ink that I very seldom attempt it. I have always felt an anxiety for the future and eternal welfare of myself, family, and friends, and I have felt an interest in the welfare of the world at large; so much so, that I have travelled nearly one hundred thousand miles among various nations, to preach the Gospel of Je- sus Christ, and for no other purpose than to do the will of God, and benefit my fellowmen, though strangers to me.  I know that Mormonism is true, that the Book of Mormon is true, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and was inspired of him to lay the foundation of the Church and kingdom, and to establish it upon the earth, to prepare the ENDENTRY It is my opinion that the family ties of such long standing should be vindicated and not yeiled nor be crowded down before the flimsy web of ^that^ "might makes right."

I feel that any prayers are answered and that God is directing you in this whirlpool of social changes which are taking place among us. I pray earnestly that He will direct the hearts of the people to youward and they may know the voice of the good sheppard in this day of visitation and trial.  Hoping and praying that you arewell and desiring to be remembered to the brethren  I remain your brother in Christ.

Brigham Young is his successor, and is clothed with the same power and authority. If Brigham's enemies should slay him, and a thousand after him, it would not stop this work, for it is the work of God; he has sustained it from the beginning, and will unto the end. Every exertion has been made, for about 30 years, to overthrow and destroy this Church and kingdom. Not only have individuals, priests, doctors, lawyers, of all sects and parties, tried to destroy it, but whole villages, towns, counties, states, and the nation itself, with its armies, have been employed for our destruction. But the more they have kicked, cuffed, driven, persecuted, fought, and laboured, the more we have prospered, increased, and grown, and strength- ened, up to the present day, and so it will con- tinue unto the end, for the very reason that God  is at the helm; he established this work, and will control it until the winding up scene.  Nearly all the inhabitants of the earth, with death, hell, and the devils, are against us, and are making war upon us, as far as they have an oppor- tunity, for our destruction.

G R ENDENTRY LOGAN, the County Seat of Cache County, Utah, is located 65 miles north of Ogden, in the centre of the Cache Valley. To describe its wonder- ful and picturesque surroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more varied sce- nery, or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is 60 miles in length from north to south, and 12 miles in width, containing nearly one-half million acres of land that will grow all the products of the temperate zone, and of such productiveness that five acres intelligently handled will yield more than an ordinary farm in the Eastern or Middle States. Logan is the commercial and agricultural centre of this magnificent valley, and is completely surrounded by the Wasatch range of mountatins, the altitude of the valley being 4502 feet above the Pacific ocean. The waters of the Logan and Blacksmith fork rivers are capable of furnishing the finest water power in the west, and are filled with trout and other fish The writer will here say that for investors seeking where unlimited facilities afford themselves, Logan is first above all other western places; the climate is all that can be de- sired, a short, mild winter and the balance of the year such as cannot be surpassed. For fruit this valley cannot be beat for flavor, quality, quantity, size or productiveness, and the finest wheat is raised here without irrigation, yielding heavy crops. Logan has a population of over 6000. Onyx and all the precious metals are all around here, and for investment of money this County cannot be excelleed. Logan has one railroad, a branch from Cache Junction on the U. N. R. R., extending 42 miles in length. Logan is the educational center of Utah—the Agricultural College, capable of accommodating 1000 students, where all art and science is taught. The Brigham Young and New Jersey Colleges, all creditable institutions and worth of patronage. The writer will mention that all lines of business are represented here, such as lumber yards, planing mills, flouring mills (roller process), machine shops, and foundries, all doing a safe and profitable trade. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoy this wonderful land, that has not a peer for beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be enjoyed without a single drawback, we say come and you will never seek further. Letters of inquiry addressed to any of the advertisers on the back of this will recieve a prompt reply.  Union Meat Market,  Logan, Utah, Sept 21 1894  J. C. KNOWLES, Proprietor.

W Woodruffend of sideways text  Dec. 13, 1890  My Dear Bertha Woodruff:  Half of text is warped by water  I have just received your letter of the 15th, and in reply will say, I am very sorry for you, and am sorry that I am not in a situation today to help you. Ensign called upon me today and wanted me to loan him $100. I am heavily in debt myself, and I have not a dollar to use only what I borrow. I was notified yesterday that I must connect the Valley House with the sewer within 10 days or be fined. I do not know how much it will cost but it will be a heavy bit I have looked for this trouble that has now overtaken both Marion and Ensign in consquence of their refusing to obey my counsel. I got them both work on the  Street cars at $60 a month cash, but they foolishly joined the stikers, joined the Union and our enemies and after this I went to the Superintendent of the com pany and got him to agree to take both of them back, and I went to them twice and urged them to return to work, but they would not do it. Now they are out of em- ployment and find it necessary to borrow means to live upon. I am sorry for their wives and children; but as long as they will not take my counsel I do not feel that I am responsible to my family. I have done all I could for them, and they would be all right today if they had hearkened to my advice. Marion did wrong in buy ing so expensive a barn. He could have built his house and been out of debt; but neither xxxxxx Marion nor Ensign seek my counsel until they get into trouble, and they then come to me for money. If there is any way opens whereby I can get $50, I will let you have in if I get it. Marion and Ensign both ought to go back to the Railroad company to work. I felt sorry to think they refused me twice after I got them the chance to go back; but this is all I need to say to you now. I am sorry that good women and children are made to suffer by the unwise course of their hus bands. I pray God to bless you and open the door for you to get the necessaries of life. As ever, Yours,  W Woodruff ENDENTRY 2 attending to all the duties of my calling openly and freely. But I am not as young as I was ten, twenty or thirty years ago, and I find that the cares and labors of the Priesthood have not diminished but increased upon me. The Kingdom grows and  responsibilities increase, notwithstanding the efforts of the wicked one and all his agencies on earth to prevent it; and although my desire is strong to visit, counsel and exhort the saints, as in years gone by, the duties of my position and the increased labors which have fallen upon me seem to make it necessary for me to shift a large portion of this labor, for the present and fu- ture, upon those who are younger and stronger than I am.  In my visit through Utah County recently I attended twelve meetings, speaking at all of them, and enjoying much of the good spirit. But I contracted  a severe cold which forced me to desist and return home, and from which I am still suffering. I hope, however, soon to be fully recovered from it. Having been so long measurably confined to limited quarters, and so little accustomed to public exercises, Brother Cannon and I felt, perhaps, too much like boys when we started out and, so far as I am concerned at least, may have overdone a little. Brother Cannon enjoys his restored liberty exceedingly, although it is far from being complete. I trust the Lord will soon remove the yoke of the enemy, so that our liberty, and that of our families also, may be perfect. We are in the hands of God.

In reply will say that about all I can do is to give you the names of my Father's family.  My Great Grand Fathers name was Josiah. He was over 100  years when he died, in the north part of Farmington, then called Northington. I do not know his childrens names.  My Grand Father's name was Eldad.

HENRY LEWIS WOODRUFF,  Dear Sir:  I received your letter of Nov. 1st several days since, and I have taken the first opportunity I could to answer. I have had a  great anxiety myself to see the Woodruff history published, but as yet it has not been done. I spent one month in London in 1840 and several months in 1846. The Woodruff book of heraldry gives two lineages of the Woodruffs. One spelled Woodroffe, the other Woodruff; the latter family we are descended from. In about 1666 on of our progenitors was Lord Mayor of London, about the time of the great fire and plague. I obtained the Woodruff Coat of Arms, and impression of which I send you herewith. Two of our fore-fathers came to America soon after the Mayflower, and settled in Matthew Woodruff came and settled in Farmington, from whom you and I descended. John settled in Farmington in 1681 and Matthew in 1716. I cannot trace the family in a direct line to our day. My great-grandfather's name was Josiah. He lived a little past 100 years. My grandfather's name was Eldad, Ozem; all born in the north part of Farmington, call Northingtons, now Avon. Eldad's son lived to about 85 years of age. Samuel was 92. My father, Apek Woodruff, died in this city 84 years of age. My mother, Bulah Thompson Woodruff, died in 1808, leaving three sons; Thompson and myself. I was the youngest, being 14 months old.  I  was born March 1st, 1807, making me 85 years, 8 months and 12 days old. My oldest brother, Azmon, died here 87 years old; my brother Thompson is still living, is in his 87th year. ENDENTRY
