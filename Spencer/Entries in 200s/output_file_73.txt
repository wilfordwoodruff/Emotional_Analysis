That Judge King would have the right to admit Warner to bail to a regular term of court by taking ample security is established by precedent. The bail would necessarily have to be high because in chap. 22, Sec. 16, of laws of Utah the pun- ishment for such a crime is imprisonment for life or not less than ten years.

I have gi prepared to answer the question according to my views. You asked me if I knew any reason in case of the death of the President of the Church why the Twelve Apostles should not choose some other person to be the President of the Church instead of the  President of the Twelve Apostles. I think I do know of several good sound reasons which I will now give you. In the first place there are two or three plain truths which are eternal, everlasting, un- changeable, and immovable as the pillars of heaven (as far as this dispensation is concerned) which have been established by the revelation of God through the mouth of the Prophet Joseph Smith. These truths stare us in the face. First, when the President of the Church dies, who  It is the  the revelations of God and none else). Then while these Twelve Apostles preside over the Church, who is the President of the Church? It is the President of the Twelve Apostles. And he is virtually as much the President of the Church while presiding over Twelve men as he is when organized into the Presidency of the Church and presid- ing over two men. And this principle has been carried out now for 57 years, ever since the organization of the Church. When Joseph Smith the Prophet was martyred, the Twelve Apostles stepped forth as the presiding authority of the Church, as ordained of God, with Brigham Young at their head to preside over the Church and direct its affairs. And when the Twelve Apostles came to organize the First Presidency, which of the Twelve stepped forth to claim the right to preside over Brigham Young?  except Sidney Rigdon, an apostate. Why did Brigham Young claim the right of the Presidency? Because he was the President of the Church while presiding over  Young died who was the presiding authority of the Church? The Twelve Apostles and  Church? John Taylor. Why? Because he was the President of the Twelve Apostles. And when the Twelve Apostles came to organize the First Presidency again, which of the Twelve Apostles  to claim the right to preside over the Church above John Taylor? Such a thing did enter into the heart of one of the Twelve Apostles, nor any other man, except Daniel H. W had a revelation that Joseph F. Smith was the man to preside over the Church. There was not one of the Twelve Apostles believed a word of it, and Brother George Q. Cannon was the most opposed to it of any man in the Quorum of the Twelve. Because President John Taylor was the President of the Twelve Apostles, and he had been virtually the President of the Church since the death of Brigham Young. (Now if Brother Cannon has become converted from this theory, or any of the Twelve, they certainly must have some very strong reasons for it.    one of the reasons why I consider the President of the Twelve should be the President of the church in case of the death of the Presi- ENDENTRY     Salt Lake City     although we have not met for a number of years.

He says he travelled 200 miles, got to camp, told his business, and they said they would kill him for being a traitor. They brought up three horses left, and then shot down a stud be- longing to bishop Clark, and dried the meat, &amp; tied the other two up. In the night the Indian crawled out, took the two horses which were left, fled for Grantsville and got in safe. He was followed by a band who went to Kimball's herd, some 170, with his wildcat stud, and tried to drive them to the main land, on the west side of the island. When they were belly deep in  water, they stampeded, went back to the island, fled into the mountains, and the Indians got none of them.

Wilford Woodruff   T Bullock ENDENTRY  President of the Church, he is not fit to be the President of the Twelve Apostles. Again, there is another eternal truth stares me in the face. In case of the death of the President of the Church, Brother  Twelve (whoever he may be); no power to appoint a president for the Church. And as far as the appointment of  never has been a dissenting voice with the Twelve Apostles. And I certainly do not believe, should President Taylor die today, that Brother George Q. Cannon nor any other man could use influence or argument enough to convert a majority of the Twelve Apostles to depart from the beaten track laid out and followed by the inspira- tion of Almighty God for the last 57 years by the Apostles as re- corded in the history of the Church. As far as I am concerned it would require not only a much stronger argument than I ever heard, but a revelation from the same God who had organized the church and guided it by inspiration in the channel in which it has traveled for 57 years, before I could give my vote or influence to depart from the paths followed by the Apostles since the organization of the Church. Again, Presidents John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff are the only two men now living in the flesh who listened to the words and charge of Joseph Smith the Prophet to the Twelve Apostles before his death when he said, "Brethren, I have had sorrow of heart for fear I might be taken away with the keys of the Kingdom o me before I sealed them upon the heads of other men. But I thank God I have lived to see the day when I have had power to give the Twelve Apostles their endow heads all the keys of the kingdom of God and the powers of the Holy Priesthood, which God has sealed upon me. And now I roll off the labor and work of the Church and kindgom of God upon the shoulders of the Twelve Apostles. And I now     Now brother Grant, with this declaration and charge ringing in my ears, should I outlive President Taylor (an event I never expect to see) I should strongly urge my brethren of the Twelve Apostles to follow the beaten track marked out and followed by the prophets and apos- tles for the last fifty seven years. And I have full confidence to believe that the Twelve Apostles ha enough to  est or any  Kingdom of God on the earth. I once knew not only   prophet and president of the Church before the death of the Prophet Joseph, but they apostatized and went to perdition.

I was informed that president George Q.

Woodruff ENDENTRY  instances that the president of the Twelve Apostles was appointed President, but it did not follow that that principle would be followed out hereafter. And the argument was used to sustain it that Elder Woodruff prophesied at a Conference at Ogden that Joseph F. Smith would yet become president of the Church, and we would have to deviate from the usual course in order to have that fulfilled. Now if Elder Woodruff delivered such a prophecy by the inspiration of the Lord (which I firmly believe he did) it will be fulfilled as sure as fate, and that too without deviating from the path marked out by the Lord, and followed by the leaders of the Church. It was said that that prophecy was recorded. I will also make a statement, that I, Wilford Woodruff, heard  and  their  time that Joseph Smith  he said Brigham Young would yet be the President of the Chur that was four years before there were any Twelve Apostles chosen, and no man knew that Brigham Young would ever be an Apostle (unless God revealed it to the Prophet). And still, after sixteen years of revelation and change, Brigha, Young was president of the Church, without turning to the right or left from the path marked out by the revelation of God. And that prophecy is al there was not one chance in ten for that to be fulfilled that there is for Joseph F. Smith to be president of the Church in the regular channel of the order of God.   lieving that in case of the death of the President of the Church, it is the right of the president of the Twelve Apostles to become the President of the Church, and that the majority of the Twelve Apostles will so decide until the coming of the  Brother Grant if you have any arguments or light outside of what I have presented as a path for the Twelve Apostles to walk in differ- ent from what we have followed as a Church, and will forward it to me, I will give it an investigation. But I will confess I do not know the reason why Brother George Q. Cannon has brought this sub- ject up and made it a matter of conversation several times since the appointment of President Taylor to the Presidency, or that he should depart from the principles he so strongly advocated in the appoint- ment of President Taylor. I see no reason why we should be so anxious to fix up  this life. (It is a bridge I never expect to cross, for I do not expect to outlive the President of the Church.)

On the night of January 30, Hiram Kimball, jun., with several other young men, had Anne  Rose in a sleigh, running a race with another sleigh. Kimball's  sleigh turned over and flung the girls on the ice, nearly killing Miss Rose, nearly broke her head. She was insensible until this morning. She is some better. Hiram Kimball's  head was bruised badly. A young man of Feramors Little's  was killed in Big Cottonwood Kanyon, by a snow slide, on the 28th ult., while opening a road through the snow.

And it seems as though the whole Christian world have their eye turned towards Utah, watching for iniquity, and can see no sin any where else, while the truth is, the cold Christian Gentile world are perfectly submerged in a sea of adultery, fornication,  manner of abominations, until they are fully ripe for the just judgments of God Almighty, which are nigh at the doors, and will soon sweep them, as with the besom of destruction, from off the earth. At the same time they lift up their hands and point with holy horror to the awful crime of po- lygamy in Utah. And I suppose they would do the same if they stood before the gates of the New Jerusalem, all of which will bear the names of the Twelve patriarchs, the sons of Isaac, and Jacob, who were polygamists, having many wives, who bore sons and daughters unto the  Lord. With these patriarchs the penalty of a- dultery was death, as in Utah.   borrow any trouble or to be uneasy about me ENDENTRY  found in the Sacramento better than ever how is i you will get gold I have a small specimen lying before me  given by Br Whippile.

Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more varied sce- nery, or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is 60 miles in length from north to south, and 12 miles in width, containing nearly one-half million acres of land that will grow all the products of the temperate zone, and of such productiveness that five acres intelligently handled will yield more than an ordinary farm in the Eastern or Middle States. Logan is the commercial and agricultural centre of this magnificent valley, and is completely surrounded by the Wasatch range of mountatins, the altitude of the valley being 4502 feet above the Pacific ocean. The waters of the Logan and Blacksmith fork rivers are capable of furnishing the finest water power in the west, and are filled with trout and other fish The writer will here say that for investors seeking where unlimited facilities afford themselves, Logan is first above all other western places; the climate is all that can be de- sired, a short, mild winter and the balance of the year such as cannot be surpassed. For fruit this valley cannot be beat for flavor, quality, quantity, size or productiveness, and the finest wheat is raised here without irrigation, yielding heavy crops. Logan has a population of over 6000. Onyx and all the precious metals are all around here, and for investment of money this County cannot be excelleed. Logan has one railroad, a branch from Cache Junction on the U. N. R. R., extending 42 miles in length. Logan is the educational center of Utah—the Agricultural College, capable of accommodating 1000 students, where all art and science is taught. The Brigham Young and New Jersey Colleges, all creditable institutions and worth of patronage. The writer will mention that all lines of business are represented here, such as lumber yards, planing mills, flouring mills (roller process), machine shops, and foundries, all doing a safe and profitable trade. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoy this wonderful land, that has not a peer for beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be enjoyed without a single drawback, we say come and you will never seek further.

W Woodruffend of sideways text       I have just received your letter of the 15th, and in reply will say, I am very sorry for you, and am sorry that I am not in a situation today to help you. Ensign called upon me today and wanted me to loan him $100. I am heavily in debt myself, and I have not a dollar to use only what I borrow. I was notified yesterday that I must connect the Valley House with the sewer within 10 days or be fined. I do not know how much it will cost but it will be a heavy bit I have looked for this trouble that has now overtaken both Marion and Ensign in consquence of their refusing to obey my counsel. I got them both work on the  Street cars at $60 a month cash, but they foolishly joined the stikers, joined the Union and our enemies and after this I went to the Superintendent of the com pany and got him to agree to take both of them back, and I went to them twice and urged them to return to work, but they would not do it. Now they are out of em- ployment and find it necessary to borrow means to live upon. I am sorry for their wives and children; but as long as they will not take my counsel I do not feel that I am responsible to my family. I have done all I could for them, and they would be all right today if they had hearkened to my advice. Marion did wrong in buy ing so expensive a barn. He could have built his house and been out of debt; but neither xxxxxx Marion nor Ensign seek my counsel until they get into trouble, and they then come to me for money. If there is any way opens whereby I can get $50, I will let you have in if I get it. Marion and Ensign both ought to go back to the Railroad company to work. I felt sorry to think they refused me twice after I got them the chance to go back; but this is all I need to say to you now. I am sorry that good women and children are made to suffer by the unwise course of their hus bands. I pray God to bless you and open the door for you to get the necessaries of life. As ever, Yours,   ENDENTRY  attending to all the duties of my calling openly and freely. But I am not as young as I was ten, twenty or thirty years ago, and I find that the cares and labors of the Priesthood have not diminished but increased upon me. The Kingdom grows and  responsibilities increase, notwithstanding the efforts of the wicked one and all his agencies on earth to prevent it; and although my desire is strong to visit, counsel and exhort the saints, as in years gone by, the duties of my position and the increased labors which have fallen upon me seem to make it necessary for me to shift a large portion of this labor, for the present and fu- ture, upon those who are younger and stronger than I am.   speaking at all of them, and enjoying much of the good spirit. But I contracted  a severe cold which forced me to desist and return home, and from which I am still suffering. I hope, however, soon to be fully recovered from it. Having been so long measurably confined to limited quarters, and so little accustomed to public exercises, Brother Cannon and I felt, perhaps, too much like boys when we started out and, so far as I am concerned at least, may have overdone a little. Brother Cannon enjoys his restored liberty exceedingly, although it is far from being complete. I trust the Lord will soon remove the yoke of the enemy, so that our liberty, and that of our families also, may be perfect. We are in the hands of God.

I have had a  great anxiety myself to see the Woodruff history published, but as yet it has not been done. I spent one month in London in 1840 and several months in 1846. The Woodruff book of heraldry gives two lineages of the Woodruffs. One spelled Woodroffe, the other Woodruff; the latter family we are descended from. In about 1666 on of our progenitors was Lord Mayor of London, about the time of the great fire and plague. I obtained the Woodruff Coat of Arms, and impression of which I send you herewith. Two of our fore-fathers came to America soon after the Mayflower, and settled in Matthew Woodruff came and settled in Farmington, from whom you and I descended. John settled in Farmington in 1681 and Matthew in 1716. I cannot trace the family in a direct line to our day. My great-grandfather's name was Josiah. He lived a little past 100 years. My grandfather's name was Eldad, Ozem; all born in the north part of Farmington, call Northingtons, now Avon. Eldad's son lived to about 85 years of age. Samuel was 92. My father, Apek Woodruff, died in this city 84 years of age. My mother, Bulah Thompson Woodruff, died in 1808, leaving three sons; Thompson and myself. I was the youngest, being 14 months old.  I  was born March 1st, 1807, making me 85 years, 8 months and 12 days old. My oldest brother, Azmon, died here 87 years old; my brother Thompson is still living, is in his 87th year. ENDENTRY
