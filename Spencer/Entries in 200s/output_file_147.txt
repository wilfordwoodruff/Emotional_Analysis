 Wherefore they shall be pluck ed out Behold I the Lord have made my Church in these last days like unto a jude sitting on a hill or in an high place to judge, the nations for it shall come to pass that the inhabitan ts of Zion shall judge all things and all liars and hypo crites shall be proved by them and they which are not Apostles and prophets shall be known and the judge and his counse lors if they are not faithful in there stewardship shall be con demned and others shall be plan in there stead for behold I say un you that Zion shall flour ish and the glory of the Lord shall be upon her and she sh[a] ll be an ensign unto the peop[le] 
 And there shall come unto her out of evry Nation under heaven and the days ^shall^ come when the Nations of the earth shall tre mble because of her and shall fear beacaus of her terrib le ones the Lord hath spoke on it Amen.  A word of wisdom for the benefit of the Council of high Priests assembled in Kirtland and Church and also the saints in Zion to be sent gree ting not by commandment or constraint but by revelation and  the word of wisdom showing forth rder and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the Last days. Given for a principle with prom se adopted to the capacity of the wealth 
 And the weakest of all Saitns wh are or can be called Saints. Behold verily thus saith the Lord unto yo u in consequence of evils and desig ns which do and will exist in the hearts of conspireing men in the last days I have warned you and forewarn you by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation that inasmuch as any man drink th wine or strong drink among you behold it is not good neither meet in the sight of your father ownly in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacram nts before him. And behold this should be wine yea pure wine of the grape of the vine of your own make. And again strong drink are not for the belly but for the washing of your bodies. And aga tobacco is not for the bodey neither 
 for the belly and is not good for man but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle to be used with judgement and skill And again hot drinks are not for the body or belly. And again verily I say unto you all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constit ution nuture and use of man evry herb in the season therof and evry fruit in the season therof. All those to be used with prudence and  thanksgiving Yea flesh also of  beast & of the fowles of the air of the Lord hath ordained you the use of  man with thanksgiving Nevertheless they are to be used sparingly & it is  pleasing unto me that they should no be used ownly in times of winter 
 Or of cold or famine All grain is ordained for the use of man & of beasts to be the staff of life not ownly for man but for  the beasts of the field and the fowles of heaven and all will animals that run or creep on the earth and those hath God made for the use of man ownly in tim es of famine and excess of hu nger All grain is good for the food of man as also the fruit of the vine that which yieldeth fruit whether in the ground or above the ground Nevertheless wheat for man and corn for the ox and oats for the horse and rye for the fowls and for swine and for all beasts of the field and barley for all useful animals and 
 for mild drinls as also other grain. And all saints who rem ember to keep and do these sa yings walking in obediance to the commandments shall receieve heath in their na vel and marrow to their bones bones and shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowle dge even hidden treasures & shall run and not be weary and shall walk & not faint and I the  Lord give unto them a promise that the destroying angel shall pass by them as the children of Israel and not slay them Amen 
 Songs of Zion Age after age has rolled away Since man first dwell in mortal clay And countles millions slept in death That once supplied a place on earth  According to the fate of man Which God had fix'd in his own plan So age must come and age must go Till worth complete is here below  Which had been seen by saints of old And by the prophets were foretold Which wondrous things are drawing near That Enoch saw and saints did cheer 
 Enoch who did convers with God Stood on the mount and stretchd abroad His soul wide as eternity He rent the vail and wonders see  With mighty faith he did expand O'er earth and heaven o'er sea and land Till things above and things below He did behold yea did them know  His heart he turn'd to notes above His soul o'erwhelmed with boundless love He sang a song in heav'nly lays While angels tongues join'd him in prais  With finger end God touch'd his eyes That he might gaze within the skies 
 His voice he raised to God on high Who herd his groans and drew him nig  With joy and wonder all amaz'd Amid the heavenly throng he gaz'd While heavenly music charmd his ear And angels notes remov'd all fear  Hosanna he aloud did say To God who dwells above the sky Again Hosanna did resound Among the heavnly hosts around  His voice he rais'd in higher strain Echo'd and re-echo'd again Till heaven and earth his voice did hear Eternity did record bare 
 The trump of God around the throne Proclamed the power of God anon And sounded loud what stand take place From age to age from race to race  Among the heavenly hosts he sang God's scheme of life for sinful man And for the gospel's saving grace He prais'd the Father face to face  The end of all his labors here were all unfolded to him there His city raised to dwell on high With all the saints above the sky  He was before him all things past From end to end from first to last Yea things before the world began Or dust was fashioned into man 
 The place of Adams first abode While in the presence of his God Before the mountains rais'd their heads Or the small dust of balance weigh'd  With God he saw his race began And from him emanated man And with him did in glory dwell Before there was an earth or hell  From age to age whate'er took place was present then before his face And to the latest years of man Was plain before him heav'ns plan  His eyes with woner did behold Eternal glories yet untold And glorious things of latter time Which angels have to tell to men 
 He then did hear in days of old The message that to John was told The angel which the news did bring He herd him talk and herd him sing  And knew before the days of John What glories were on him to dawn The message which he did recieve He herd and saw and did believe  He knew full well what John should hear Concerning times and latter years When God again should set his hand To gather Israel to their lands  The gospel then from darkest shades Should rise and go with rapid strides Till nations distant far and near The glorious proclamation hear 
 The angel that this news proclaims Should come and visit earth again commit the gospel long since lost To man with power as at the first  THE great and glorious gospel light Has usherd forth into my sight Which in my soul of lane receivd From death and bondage being freed  With saints below and saints above Ill join to praise the God of love Like Enoch too I will proclaim A loud Hosanna to his name  Hosanna let the echo fly From pole to pole from sky to sky And saints and angels join to sing Till ^all^ eternity shall ring 
 Hosanna let the voice extend Till time shall cease and have no end Till all the throngs of heaven above Shall join the saints in songs of love  Hosanna let the triump of God proclaim his wonders far abroad And earth and air and skies and seas Conspire to sound aloud his praise  ERE long the vail will send in twain The king descend with all his train The earth shall shake with awful fright And all creation feel his might  The truimp of God it long shall sound And rase the nations under ground Throughout the vast domains of heaven The voice echoes the sound is given 
 Lift up your heads ye saints in peace The Savior comes for your release The day of the redeem'd has come The saints shall all be welcom'd home  Behold the church it soars on high To meet the saints amid the sky To hail the King in clouds of fire And strike and tune the immortal lyre  Hosanna now the trump shall sound Proclaim the joys of heav'n around When all the saints together join In songs of love and all divine  With Enoch here we all shall meet And worship at Messiah's feet Unite our hands and hearts in love And reign on thrones with Christ above 
 The city that was seen of old Whose walls were jasper and streets gold We'll now inherit thron'd in might The Father and the Son's delight  Celestial crowns we shall receieve And glories great our God shall give While loud hosannas we'll proclaim And sound aloud our Saviors name  Our hearts and tongues all joined in one A loud hosanna to proclaim While all the heavens shall shout again And all creation say, Amen 
 For Baptism  COME ye children of the kingdom Sing with me for joy to day Gather round as Christ's disciples Kneel with grateful hearts and pray  There's aline contain'd in Matthew What the Savior said to John And the sacred words from heaven This is my beloved Son.  As 'twas said to Nicodemus So I must be born again Tis by water and the spirit I the promise may obtain  So I will obey the Savior Keep his law and do his will That I may enjoy forever Happiness on Zions hill 
 Songs of Zion  My soul is full of peace and love I soon shall see Christ from above And angels too the hallow'd throng Shall join with me in holy song  The spirits power has sealed my peace And filled my soul with heav'nly grace Transported I with peace and love Am waiting for the throngs above  Prepare my heart prepare my tongue To join His glorious heav'nly throng To hail the Bridegroom from above And join the band in songs of love  Let all my powrs of mind combine To hail my Savior all divin To hear his voice attend his call And crown him King and Lord of all 
 THE happy day has rolled on The glorious period now has come The angel sure has come again To introduce Messiah's reign  The gospel trump again is heard The truth from darkness has appear'd The lands which long in darkness lay Have now beheld a glorious day  The day by prophets longs foretold The day which Abraham did behold The day that saints desired long When God his strange work would perform  The day when saints again should hear The voice of Jesus in their ear And angels who above do reign Come down to converse hold with men 
 The Celestial Home  BEYOND these earthly scenes insight Immortal beings rest In realms of infinite delght The home of Jesus Christ  CHORUS O the home the glorious home Of the beloved Son Where the righteous all shall meet And be forever one!  Celestial home! could our weak eyes But half its charms explore How would our souls desire to rise And live on earth no more O the home of the glorious home &c  There pain and sorrow never come No nothing there is vain But perfect peace and ceaseless bloom With endless pleasure reign O the home &c 
 No curse those blissful regions known Nor fears create dispair For sin the source of evry wo Can never enter there O the home &c.  There changing time is never known Nor Sun o'er mountain brow But God upon his shining thone Fills one eternal now O the home &c.  There is a land the Lord will bless Whare all the Saints shall come There is a day for righteousness When Israel gathers home Before the word goes forth destroy And all the wicked burn With songs of everlasting joy The pure in heart return 
 Their fields beyond Missouris flood Are in perspective seen As unto Israel Canaan stood While Jordan flow'd between  Through wicked men and Satan strive to keep us from that land they drive To try the Lords command  There all the springs of God will be And there an end of strife And there the righteous rising free Shall have eternal life  There shall the will of God be done And saints and Angels greet And there when all in Christ is me The best from worlds shall meet  There in the resurrection morn The living live again And all the children will be born Without the sting of sin  How long our Father O how long Shall that pure time delay Come on come on ye holy throng And bring the glorious day

Beloved Brethren:  On Saturday last the 28th ult, the Fifth Company of this seasons emigration left Liverpool per Guion S. S. Wisconsin, in charge of Elder Abraham Maw, with Wm L. Stewart as his first, and H. H.  Thomas as his second counsellors. Brother Geo. F. Phillips clerk of Company. John T. Kay and James H. Newton returning missionaries. Elder James Johnson, of the Sugar House Ward, who had been visiting his friends, and obtaining some genealogy, returned with this Company. We telegraphed you 123 had sailed, but there were only 113, one family by the name of Thos. DeLara turned back. This reduced the numbers as follows 5 Missionaries 108 emigrants 73 full and 15 half fares including missionaries We shall not send any more companies until August 2nd when another company of British Saints will sail per Guion S. S. Wisconsin D. V. We are all well at 42, I am thankful to say; Brother Walter Hoge and L. R. Thomas are at- tending to the business and emigration in the office and John E. Carlisle on the "Millennial 
 Star." Bro. Carlisle has been on a visit to London with Dr H. J. Richards and family, Bro. Phillips has been assisting on the Star but he has left for Bear Lake Stake where he expects to make his home. Brother Joseph Whiteley, the convert from the Church of England has also left this country to make a home amongst the Saints. We have had a visit from several of the excursionists. Bro. Ellerbeck, wife and daughter, Philip Pugsley, wife and daughter Wm Spicer and wife Wm Fuller wife and daughter, James Poulsen, Chas. G. Shill, Mrs S. Teasdel and son and others. These excursionists do a great deal of good. Sisters Baugh and Thomas came over to meet their husbands who were returning home from their missionary labors, and they visited with their husbands relatives and friends; also Sisters Morris, McGhie and others have represented the Saints in Utah with much good effect. R. F. Neslen also did much good amongst the Saints. His trip did him much good temporaly, I should say physically, for his health improved very much, and also spiritually. I hope it will continue with him. I am pleased with the good reports received from the Presidents of Companies and the good work accom plished by our brethren at New York. With kind love I remain, Your brother, Geo. Teasdale. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42, Islington, Liverpool, July 11th 1890.  President W. Woodruff and Council.  Beloved Brethren:  As I was pre- paring to leave for Cheltenham to attend the Bristol Conference, your esteemed favor of the 27th came to hand. I must say it was a surprise to me as I was not look- ing for it until the fall at the end of the Emigration season. But I am a minute man and go and come at the call of my file leaders, for I have but one desire in life and that is to be where my heavenly Father wishes me to be. This mission has been a blessing to me and I am thankful to Him for the experience. Last Sunday I attended a very good Conference and Priesthood meet- ings at Birmingham, and on Sunday week we have a Conference of the Welsh Mission. I have received a letter from Bro. J. Jack about an extra charge being made in the fare from Copenhagen. I have sent the letter to Prest Fjeldsted for explanations. There are always two sides, and frequently much mis- representations, that it is always better to hear both sides before judging. I am thankful 
 to say my health is good and I am en- joying my mission. I preached the gospel yesterday to a gentleman who was here in this room for two hours and three quarters. When I return from Cheltenham I will write you again, as I am a little hurried this morning to take the noon train. I have been so busy since receiving your letter I have had no time to think. So you will kindly excuse this hasty epistle and rest assured I shall have pleasure in carrying out your councils to the best of my poor endeavor.  With kind love to you all believe me very affectionately  Your brother in tribulation George Teasdale  [sideways text] Geo. Teasdale 11 July 1890 Recd July 24 [end of sideways text]

President W. Woodruff, & Council.  Beloved Brethren:  Your ever welcome  and esteemed favors of the 14th, 20th and 28th of May  have come safe to hand and contents noted. Elder  J. W. Clawson, his wife and chilren arrived here  June 11th per Guion S. S. Alaska and left for London on  Friday morning June 13th. Your suggestions about an  organization, as the brethren had at Ann Arbor will  be suggested to them and I hope be productive of  much good. The action of the U. S. officials with  regard to our emigration was brought to my  notice in the press dispatches of the morning  papers and I wrote to Mr Tenbroeck, a copy of  which I enclose. I hope our emigration, under  the blessing of God, will not be interfered with. We are striving to be in harmony with the laws  but it seems as though the U. S. Government was  determined to fill up their cup speedily. Our  emigration is very nicely cared for everywhere.  Mr Ramsden continues as energetic and care ful as ever to have our emigrants well treated. I do not know how such a rumour could  have reached you that I had released Elder  Frederick Stauffer from the Turkish Mission

President Wilford Woodruff, and Council.  Beloved Brethren:  Yesterday I had to cable you for ten hundred pounds in conse- quence of the heavy drafts made upon us and a mistake in not drawing sufficient upon you for the fourth Company. I was afraid we would not have sufficient to pay Guion & Co for the sea passage of the June 28th Company and drafts were continually being presented and the money wanted and our emigration being at a stand still until the 2nd of August I saw we were going to be bankrupt, and so cabled for ten hundred, owed us by the office, to save us. Mssrs Guion & Co have just informed us that the Wyoming arrived safe in New York yesterday morning the 19th at 5 a.m. and that they left at 3 p.m. the same afternoon. We are rejoicing in the blessing of God attending our companies. In conversation with Mr. Ramsden I told him I did not know but what we would have to quit sending companies. He asked why? do not they go through all right? I replied yes but there is so much prejudice against us and the people of the States so stirred up by 
 as I had not thought of such a thing. Brother  Stauffer is quietly doing as well as any miss- ionary who ever went to Turkey. I have for- warded him your letter, with a letter from  myself and enclosed a five pound note  to assist him in expenses. In this weeks "Star"  which will [be] issued next Monday there is an inter- esting letter from him under date of May 17th. It  bears postmark of a later date and would have  been published earlier but I have been away at tending conferences and visiting. Bro. J. E. Carlisle  is away with br. Heber J. Richards & family visiting  London. Bro. Phillips is assisting me on the "Star"  He leaves on the 28th of June for Bear Lake.  He has been quite a help to me in the editorial  department. He has an excellent education  and is a gentleman, but I think rather a fiery temper when crossed. His expressions have  to be toned down, andbut with me he has been  as humble as a child, and treated me with  a great deal of respect. I am sorry to lose  him, and he expresses sorrow to leave. But the  way has opened up for his emigration and  I would not detane him. If he continues in  the love of the gospel and true humility he will  be a great blessing to himself, and likely others. We all join in kind love; the folks at 42 are all  well. Ever praying for the blessing of God to attend you  now and for ever, Your humble brother in the Covenant  George Teasdale

Beloved Brethren:  On friday last,  20th inst, the following named missionaries arriv- ed in Liverpool, per Guion S. S. Wisconsin. They spent  Sunday with us and were appointed to the Conferences  named as follows Frederick W Chappell, to the  Manchester; James H. Clark and Richard Graham to Leeds; John F. Merrill, Samuel S. Newton and Edmund  M. Dugdale to Newcastle; Thomas Wheatley Jr. and Charles Cottrell Jr to Sheffield; Charles T. Black and  Prime Coleman to Norwich; Henry Moyle to Bris- tol; James Smith to London & Edward Burton to  the Nottingham Conferences; and James H. Cook  to the Scottish Mission. These were all for the British  Mission. Anders S. Hyrup for the Scandinavian  and Joseph A. Young for the Swiss & German Mis- sion.  On Saturday 21st June Elders George H. Baugh and  wife, Hyrum Ricks and Noah Williams returned  home per Guion S. S. Alaska, R. F. Neslen, W. Langton &  F. T. Bailey with their wives and some others going to Utah  sailed on the same vessel.  You referred to Prest J. U. Stucki being released if we  had any one to succeed him. There is only Brother 
 the newspapers against our emigration. He smiled "oh never mind that" he said "when you cannot send companies then we will have to try some other way." "You do not send emigrants in violation of law," no paupers no contract la- borers do you? he said "No" I replied. He then told me of an interview he once had with the American Consul in Liverpool when Enarts tried to stop the emigration and the Consul asked him if the "Mormons" were of the above class &c. He is cheerful and sanguine, has good faith our people will go through all right so long as they honor the laws. This we propose to do by the grace of God and continue to trust in Him. It is His work and He will over- rule all things to suit His glorious will. My only anxiety is that His will may be done and His puposes fulfilled. I think we are safe if we do His will and keep His commandments. I believe in His promise "If you love me and keep my commandments you shall prosper in the land" [##2 Nephi 4:4##] Every Latter-day Saints knows this to be true and they are full of thankfulness, light & truth. Tomorow Elders Hyrum Ricks, Noah Williams and Geo. H. Baugh return to Zion per S. S. Alaska Brother Baugh's wife has been here on a visit returns with him. Bros R. F. Neslen, Wm Langton & wife Bailey & wife, Wm. Knowles, Bro Baugh's wifes brother, Eliza Jones and some relatives of Wm Langton & wife are going to accompany this party of returning missionaries and visitors. All seem to have been benefit ed by their trip. We are all well at 42 and join in kind love  Your brother George Teasdale. 
 Theo. Brandley and if he was taken from the  office to preside, he would need some one to succeed  him. Bro Stucki spoke of a brother residing at  Elsinore who was very capable. His name is  Richard Haag. He also said he could use  twelve good missionaries in the Swiss and Ger- man mission if he had them. There has been  a revival in that mission where good competent  Elders are. We all want good competent Elders; like  everything else there is always room at the top. The  Elders generally ^when they arrive here^ do not know much about the  principles themselves, and by the time they learn  to teach others, and are useful in the ministry,  it is time for them to go home; especially is this so  where they have to learn the language. If it meets  your approbation Prest Stucki will leave for home  with the next company from the Swiss and  German mission, and Bro. Brandley will be ap- pointed to succeed him. Elder C. D. Fjeldsted ar- rived here November 13th 1886 and Elder Jas. Leaing  October 13th, 1886. Will you kindly inform me if  you think they should return home. They are  bootth very excellent missionaries and of course  we hate to part with them, and they are willing to  stay until it is deemed wisdom for them to re- turn. I would like your council on the matter  that I may be satisfied. Men in the enjoyment of  the Holy Spirit only want to be where the Lord wants  them, and they have joy in their missions despite the dis- couraging circumstances. Your brother,  George Teasdale

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42, Islington, Liverpool, August 13th 1890.  President Wilford Woodruff, and Council.  Beloved Brethren:  I have the honor of submitting to you, by this mail, our month- ly statement, for the past month, July.  Since receiving your esteemed favor of June 27, and later communications, we have endeavored to fulfil your expressed wish, to arrange the affairs of the mission, so that when our successor arrived, we could turn over the bu- siness of the mission to him, and make all the necessary explanations concerning its details &c. This will account for our dis- bursements being rather heavy during the last month. We paid Fazakerleys bookbinding bill of  96.12.0, our takxes  9.15.4, House cleaning Whitewashing &c  4.3.5, Gasbill  2.6.4, Coal  2.10.6 and so forth. We shall do our best to have every- thing in good shape to turn over to our suc- cessor, all bills paid, and the house clean and comfortable. We were very much pleased with your reconsideration of the brother who should succeed me, and acknowledge the hand of God in it. I am thankful for the kindly consider- ation you have had for me, and very much 
 appreciate your friendship and brotherly love. I am very thankful to God for His sustaining grace. Notwithstanding all the anxieties, cares and tribulations, I have enjoyed the experience of this mission exceedingly, and what little good may have been done, to God be the glory.  We have sought His counsel and He has guided. The broadcast distribution of tracts and prin ted matter will be like the "bread cast upon the waters," already do we hear of a spirit of inquiry being madenifest. I have good faith in printers ink. The Lord is doing His own work, and it is not by wisdom of man, but by His Spirit is He accomplishing His mighty purposes. It is a great pity there are so few who believe God. I shall be pleased to receive any instructions you may have for me as to my future. We are all reasonably well at 42, and join in love to yourselves, our brethren of the Twelve, and the brethren with you in the office. May peace and blessing be thine  Your brother in the Kingdom of patience George Teasdale  [sideways text] Geo. Teasdale 13 Aug. 1890 [end of sideways text] 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42 Islington, Liverpool, July 19th 1890.  President W. Woodruff & Council.  Beloved Brethren:  We had a most excellent Conference on Sunday last at Cheltenham, the 13th inst, and a priesthood meeting on Saturday evening. There were 9 Elders from Utah present. On Tuesday evening we held a fellowship meeting which was well attended and a number of interesting testimonies borne. On Wednesday I returned to the office and met Elders Lorus Pratt, John Hafen and J. B. Fairbanks en route to Paris and James J. W. Duncan who arrived in Liverpool on Saturday night the 12th inst per Guion S. S. Nevada. They were all in ex- cellent health and spirits. They met with us at our Wednesday evening meeting and we had an ex- cellent testimony meeting. Afterwards we met in the prayer room at 42 Islington and Elder Lorus Pratt was appointed the president of the French Mission and set apart for that responsibility. So we have a representation in France. Elder Duncan was appointed to labor in the Scottish Mission. I was acquainted with him when he was a boy about 8 years of age in Scotland. His father presided over the Tranent Branch of the Edinburgh Conference in 1859 and 60; he emigrated to Utah and died 
 there. Now his youngest son 38 years of age is going to bear his testimony in the place where once his fathers voice was heard in defence of the Everlasting Gospel. With this mail you will receive the financial report of the mission for June. Bro. Jno W. Young arrived this morning from London with David H. Cannon and Willie Young. They leave to-day by Cunard S. S. Umbria, all well. Bro. Edward Burton of the late arrival of missionaries returns home dreadfully homesick. We cannot pursuade him. His President, Bro. Creer of Notts, and the Elders there have labored with him but of no avail. He cannot endure it. He leaves by S. S. Nevada to-day. I leave to-day for Merthyr to attend a Conference of the Welsh Mission and priesthood meeting to night. We are all well at 42 and join in kind love to the First Presidency and Twelve whom we sustain in our entreire confidence and faith and prayers night and morning and whom may the God of Israel bless for ever and for ever  Affectionately your brother in the Kingdom of patience George Teasdale  [sideways text] Geo.

[end of sideways text]  [unknown writer] Supply these missionaries  LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42 Islington, Liverpool, August 2nd 1890.  President W. Woodruff, and Council.  Beloved Brethren:  We have just witnessed the departure of the 6th Company, of this seasons emi- gration, per Guion S. S. Wisconsin, in charge of Elder Leonard J. Jordan, with Isaac J. Riddle as his first and John D. Evans as his second counsellor. Elders Edward M. Perkins and Robert Harmon returning missionaries. The last named returning at his own request through family affairs, and declining health. It is a small company of 81 souls and 4 returning missionaries 85 Total 45 full and 19 half fares. 45 males and 40 females. We instructed Elder Jordon to telegraph Elder Jas. Jack from New York, Norfolk, Chattanooga, Kansas City and Denver. We have to give the brethren in charge all instructions, as it is a new business, or experience, to them. People who are engaged in a business, that time and experience have made them proficient in, are apt to forget there was a time when they were ignorant of it, and think all men should have the knowledge they themselves possess. As a general rule we know the Presidents are ignor- ant of what is required of them in taking a com- pany of emigrants through to Utah, and are careful 
 to give them all necessary information, as theirs is a labor of love, and we are anxious for the Saints to go in peace and safety. If we fail it is because we may be too confident in the ability of the President, and think he knows more than he really does. Elders John R. Booth, Smith Wells Robertson and Joseph Shipley arrived here on Thursday last, the 31st ult. I was hoping you would have sent us more help. 12 missionaries who came in 1889 & 1890 for the British Mission have returned through ill health, or other causes, who should be useful in this mission to-day, and who were calculated upon, so we are short that number now. Then we have some ten elders who came in 1888 who expect to be released this fall. We have only 8 Elders in Wales now, we had twenty at one time, and should have 16 or 18 at least if that mission is to be kept up. We have only 4 Elders in Ireland, we should have 6 or 7. We have only 9 Elders in Scotland we should have 11 or 12 at least. So we will want 3 for Scotland 3 for Ireland 8  for Wales and 10 for England as soon as we can have them. We are all well at 42.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42 Islington, Liverpool, July 30th, 1890.  Prest Wilford Woodruff and Council.  Beloved Brethren:  Since last writing to you I have attended Conferences of the Welsh and Scottish Missions. We had excellent meet- ings which were well attended, but the reports were not very encouraging with regard to bap- tisms. In the Welsh Mission they had not baptized one in six months, but in Scotland two baptisms were reported, for the six months, and six baptisms in July, since the 30th of June. In the six months 15,531 tracts had been distributed, 26 of the cheap edition of the Book of Mormon had been sold, and 189 cheap Voice of Warning. In the Scottish Mission 13,265 tracts had been distributed by the Glasgow Tract Society, in six months, and 14,619 by the Elders &c in their districts for three months report, making a total of 27,884 tracts distributed, 11 Books of Mormon sold, 5 loaned, 13 Voice of Warning sold, 8 loaned, 5 given away by the Elders, to friends or acquaintance. There is a seem ing indifference amongst the people generally, or if convinced lack the moral courage to obey; Yet the Elders are in no wise discouraged, they feel well, and we hade most excellent meetings. The and ^elders^ are filled with praise and thanksgiving. There seems to be a deep rooted prejudice against 
 us, and frequently the Elders are insulted, the people re- fusing to receive the tracts, or hold any conversation with them. The Protestants and Catholics are holding "Demonstrations" in the open air, and in the largest halls. Last Sunday on Glasgow Green there was a protes- tant demonstration, and they had to be protected by squads of policeman, which we saw march down to the foot of the Nelson Monument, on Glasgow Green. We live in a momentous age.  Your favor of June 30 reached us after Elder Jas. R. Smith had returned, through sickness and family affairs, he left here per S. S. Wyoming July 12th, with Bro & Sister McGhie. I return letter written for him.  Your esteemed favor of July 7 also to hand and contents noted.  On Saturday next Aug 2 a company from the British mission will sail, per S. S. Wisconsin, we expect about one hundred souls. We are all well in the office; the printers are working a "Star" ahead for their annual holiday of one week. Bro L. R. Thomas has gone to the Birmingham ^Conf[eren]ce^ to have three months in preaching the gospel, previous to returning home. He has been here going on three years, and has been very useful.  All at 42 desire to join me in kind love to yourselves, and all in the office.  I remain, Your brother & fellow laborer, George Teasdale.  [sideways text] Geo.

 The Council of the Twelve Apostles, to the Breth- ren at Winter Quarters, and esspecially to such as shall hereafter arrive at that place Greeting  Beloved Brethren,  We have now completed the organization of the Pioneer Company,  of which we are members, and whom we are about to lead to the Mountains or over the Moun- tains, as we shall be councilled by our Leader in search of a resting place for ourselves, our families, and all who desire to follow us and work Righteous- ness; and by doing this we prove to you and to all the world, that we do not wish to be a whit behind the first of you, in leaving wife, children, friends, rest,  or any of the enjoyments of social life; and that we are willing to take our full share of troubles, trials, losses and crosses, hardships and fatigues, weariness and watchings, for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake; and we feel to say come calm or strife, turmoil or peace, life or death; in the name of Israel's God we mean to  conquer or die trying: We mean to open up the way for the salvation of the honest in heart from all na- tions or sacrifice every thing in our stewardship, and if we fail in the attempt, having done all we could, Our Father will not leave his flock without a Shep- herd.  In connection with the Pioneer Company we have organized all in your place and vicinity who wish to join the emigration, into companies of Tens, fifties,  and hundreds, in two divisions, with a President 
 and two Councillors to each division, with the sanction of their respective companies, and having called the Presidents, Councillors, and Captains of hundreds to- gether, have advised with them and decided that all the High Council that is necessary to be left at Winter Quarters, after the present High Council shall have left, will be the Presidents and Captains of Emigration Companies.  And where the present Pres- idents of Divisions and Captains shall remove they will leave others similarly organized with the approval of the brethren, or those who thus enter into the organiza- tion.  The brethren now organized, have heard the Word and the Will of the Lord on which this organ- ization is founded and have given their hearty assent unto it, and any hesitancy in carrying out their pledges or acting in Concert with their Presidency, as they well know will be at the loss of a glory that they ^can^ never regain,  therefore, we say that that these instructions generally are more especially to such as shall hereafter arrive at  your place; so that they may receive the principles and instructions that those have had, who have been with  us the past winter.  The business of the Saints at Winter Quarters from this time is to journey West, until further instructions: and while some will have the means to  go forward at the springing of grass, others will have  to stop and raise grain to carry with them: and while some will come here prepared, others will have stop and prepare for their journey: and in either case,  all preparation and organization is for journeying and not for a permanent location at Winter Quarters, and  if any refractory members should make their appear- 
 ance, the Bishops will see that justice is done them,  and let no iniquity have place in your midst.  It is the privilege of the brethren who remain, or arrive hereafter, to decide, but the Council urgently recommends to them to remove the lesser houses on to the line, of Winter Quarters, or on the borders of the most populated blocks, so as to defend themselves, by houses, pickets, ditches, &c against the Indians, so that your women and children may not be insulted and abused, and their tables robbed, while they are draw- ing water, or gathering the fruits of their gardens or attending to any domestic duties, in your absence.  Let the brethren labor unitedly in making fields, fencing, planting, harvesting &c all under the di- rection of their respective captains of Tens and Fifties, - over whom will be the supervision of their Captains of hundreds and Presidents who will allot to each family all the ground they need or can till, for a garden, in the City of Winter Quarters or its immediate vicinity  so that all may share equally in the comforts and  luxuries of the table.  The Idler shall not eat the bread of the laborer, therefore let a record be kept, by the  Captains of each Ten, or his clerk, how each man em- ploys his time, from day to day; and let the same be reported weekly to the Clerk of the division or Presi- dency of the organization; and let one tenth of the avails of each man's labor be appropriated for the benefit of the poor and sick, under the direction of the Bishops, attending to the Council of the Presidency; for the poor ye have always with you, and the sick often: and he who administers to them, serveth the Lord.  Your crops, and cattle will be exposed 
 to the aggression of the Omahaws, and other Indians, and we say to you take care of them, learn to watch as well as pray, for the farther you go West, the more  you will be exposed and if the Saints cannot watch them safely here here, what will they do when they  get where civilzation or half civilization is unknown.  Make good fences around your corn fields, and locate families near sufficient to watch and keep them safe,  and let the emigrants be diligent and careful to plow,  plant, and fence all they possibly can before they start on their journey.  We advise the brethren to keep the up the a police of their most effective men at Winter Quarters as we have done for  [th] in an hour ye know think not, evil may be upon you; and pray them for their services so that they will not be obliged to neglect your safety, for a loaf of bread, to satisfy their hunger or that of their families.  It is highly important in this dispensation that every brother learns his duty,  and acts accordingly: in doing which, every one who can, will pay their herdsmen in money, flour, grain,  &c as they shall need, for their comfort, or to prosecute their journey, and not complete compel them to urge payment of the Sisters whose husbands are in the  army, the Widows, and poor, and let the herdsmen be diligent in striving to deliver all the cattle &c entrust- ed to their charge, at the proper time, to those who are emigrating West, and such of those, as cannot pay down, agree upon the Cattle you shall mark as your own to be held in society, to be paid for or delivered to you at a future day. 
 It is our wish and Council that the Em- igration company now formed, shall follow the Pioneers, as soon as the grass is sufficient to support the teams, and the Presidents, and Captains will examine and know that every soul that goes in said Com- pany is provided with from 3 to 500 lbs of bread stuff,  or a year and a halfs, and as much more as he can get for we know not whether we can raise corn this summer, as we anticipate at the place of location.  Let the first Emigration company take with them as many of the Sisters whose husbands are in the Army, as can fit themselves out, or can be conveniently fitted out.  It is wisdom that all the men in the Emigration Company shall be organized into a mili- tary body, under their respective Captains of 10s, 50s, and 100s with Charles C. Rich as their Commander in Chief who will see that every man is properly armed, and ready to meet any savage encounter at a moment's warning, taking care that caps and priming of all firelocks are so secured as to admit of no acci- dents: that John Scot superintend the artillery un- der C. C. Rich Horace S. Eldredge be marshal  Hosea Stout Captain of the Guard on the journey and that the guard watch during the night, and sleep as they have during the day:  The first company will carry the Temple bell, with fixtures for hanging at a moment's notice, which will be rung at daylight, or a proper time, and call all who are able to arise to prayers, after which ringing of bell and breakfast, or ringing of bell and departure in 15 minutes to secure the cool of the day till breakfast time &c as the bell may 
 be needed, particularly in the night Seasons, if Indians are hovering round to let them know you are at your duty, and if any man acts disorderly, punish him severely.  Whenever a Company of 75 men, who do not belong to the present organized Company, shall be organized so as to carry out the principles of the Word and Will of the Lord and these instructions, according to the Pattern, with or without families, and provisions enough to sustain each soul 18 months, they may come on till the 1st of July, but in all cases, the brethren must run their own risk for food and not depend on the pioneers, or any Company in advance for support in the least, either for their teams, themselves, or families, for we are credibly informed that more than 30 souls of the Oregon Emigrants, perished in the Mountains with hunger the last season; and 100 bushels of corn can easier bye raised near Winter Quarters, than the 50 bushels at the foot of the Mountains.  If a man of the 1st Emigration com- pany, who is going to stop at your place for the time being, should so far forget his Covenant in the Temple, and his more recent obligations and agree- ments as to retain his wagon or team, from the neces- sities of the journey: it will be the duty of the Presi- dents to instruct the captains to take the same and apply it where necessity requires, and thus compel the owner to do what he had previously agreed to, for as some were compelled to come in, in Ancient days, others must be compelled to remain in, ^in^ latter days, and men who are taken at their word have no reason to find fault.  For the Council, (Signed) Brigham Young, President. Willard Richards, Clerk 
 Pioneer Camp of Israel. Platt river, about 50 miles from Winter Quarters, April 16th 1847.  P.S. We recommend the brethren to search for a ford across the Horn, near where said river leaves the Bluffs of some 20 miles north of the usual ferry, or West of Old Council Bluffs, as it will save much trouble travel, if such a ford be found, or a good place for  a Ferry.

I have but my family with me and they are astound- ed at the great city of London, Prest. Teasdale is expediting busi- ness and expects to sail near the first to fourth of October.

 Of course my experience is limited and I know but few of the elders; but there is a splendid body of missionaries in this conference. Bro Laeny presides with dignity and his brethren are able helps. Of course Bro. Laeny will be released to return home but ^we^ shall have difficulty to fill his place; his experience is great and also his ability, at least I think so.  Have talked with a few of the brethren about their prospects and find that they generally support themselves, costing them from three to four pounds ([ohshaw]). 3 to 4   per. mo. to live, which means I understand comes from their private pockets or is sent them by their friends. The people are pretty well "proved," it seems, but the Lord knows first what He is  doing.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42, Islington, Liverpool, August 16th 1890.  President Wilford Woodruff and Council.  Beloved Brethren:  The seventh com- pany of this seasons emigration, left here to-day,  per Guion S. S. Wisconsin, under the Presidency  of Jonas Ostlund, with A. F. Anderson, as his first  and Michael A. Hansen, as his second counsellor. Andrew J. Aagaard, and Joseph C. Kempe, return- ing missionaries', the first named through ill health There are 134 souls in the company, 67 full, and  25 half fares. Included in this number are  two sisters, visitors, who have been visiting their  friends in Scotland, Sisters Janet Morris, and Dick. They are in excellent health and spirits, and  truly faithful Latter-day Saints. Sister Clara  Johnson, and her two boys, returning from a  visit to friends; and a good sister, Mary A Chambers, leaving all her family and going  alone to Zion, to spend her days with the Saints  of God. All the others are from Scandinavia. They appear to be a very fine class of our people. I met with them on Wednesday eve- ning last, and I enjoyed much freedom  in speaking to them. The president, Bro Ostlund, says, he has had no trouble with them at all in 
 nan 
 crossing the sea. They are willing and obedient,  full of hope. Our good friend Mr Ramsden gave  the Elders two state rooms, worth at this sea- son of the year  45.0.0 a room, had refused passengers. The saloon and intermediate was  full but our people had the best rooms in  the ship. He kindly sent me word ^that^ on wWednesday ^that^ our company, pr. S. S. Wisconsin, in charge of Leonard  I. Jordan, arrived in New York at 7 a.m. and  left at 3 p.m., which intelligence was gratefully  received, and we praised God in His holiness. Truly  has He blessed us, and holds us in His protect- ing care. We are surrounded with wickedness. The Guion Co. is having a good season, I am happy  to say. They bless us and the Lord is blessing them. Every berth in the next two ships are engaged. So  you see it does not militate against them carrying the "Mormon" emigration. Our next com- pany is a British company sailing September 6th. We expect the Swiss & German Saints will join them.

Dear Brethren:  The ninth company  of this seasons emigration left Liverpool today, per Guion S. S. Wyoming, in charge of Elder Jens  Jensen, with Lars C. Johnson, as his first and  Eric Hogan, as his second counsellors. J. A. Farslund and Annie Anderson, wife of Elder  Anderson who died on a mission to Denmark, were  returned as missionaries, Bro Farslund having been  engaged in the Scandinavian Office. The company  numbered 187 souls 102 full 39 half fares. There  were a few from the British Mission some  23 souls.  Elder B. Young and family arrived here on  Sep. 4th, on the 5th the passengers for the eighth  company arrived and went on board the S. S.  Wisconsin in charge of Elder J. U. Stucki with  Alfred Budge and C. Meyer as his counsellors. That company numbered 116 souls. Elders Henry  Tuckett, John Ischi and Jacob Schweizer return- ing missionaries. These sailed Sep 6.  We had a conference announced for Sunday  7th at London I had promised to attend  and had to leave 11.5 on Saturday the 6th a.m. 
 So when the Company was properly organized and  all the business attended to; I left with Brother Young and family to London and attended  Conference and returned to Liverpool in time to  attend to this 9th Company. Brother Young re- mained until to-day when he left to attend the  Norwich Conference and his family returned  to Liverpool. With this company we shall close  up our seasons business, so far as I am concern ed. We have advertised, to send all, who have  not been prepared to go in the September  companies, that a company will leave ^here Oct 11th^ from  any part of the European Mission and we  have already a good many names. But  we shall now take stock and turn over  the business in a proper manner and send  you a balance sheet with the September  Report, which will close my labors in  the Presidency of the British Mission. We were  informed by the Guion Co. who received their  report from New York that Bro. Young would  not arrive until the next sailing of the  Alaska, and knew of no difference until  I received a letter from Bro W. C. Spence a  few days before Bro. Brighams arrival.

We have taken stock closed up the  accounts and have had everything audited and  send you the statement thereof for your inspection.  There will be bills not paid from  75 to  80 pounds  which should be deducted from the Profits and  then we have carried some accounts that have been  reported year after year as assets to "Doubtful accounts"  and charged Profit and loss which will here after put  the business in better shape. I cannot but regret that  it should have been considered essential to remove  me from the Presidency of the European Mission until  the seasons business was completed and everything  closed up in a business like manner; but I presume  my labors are required somewhere else and so hav- ing turned over everything to my fellow laborer Apostle B. Young I waive all my personal wishes  and hasten to Mexico where D. V. I hope to have the un- speakable happiness to report myself to you face to face  I send these statements and reports per Elder Walter Hoge  who, having labored some time in the office, will be 
 able to give you any information you may  wish concerning the accounts, emigration, or  missionary labors of the European Mission.  I am thankful to our heavenly  Father beyond expression for the experience of the  last six years; two of which was spent in Mexico  and nearly four in the European Mission. I hope  He will accept of my labors and pardon all my  short comings and in anything where I have err- ed or failed. What little good that may have  been done to Him be the honor & glory. I am well  paid in the honor to be His servant.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42 Islington, Liverpool, June 18th 1890  Pres. Wilford Woodruff  Dear Bro.  I trust you will not consider it presumptous in me to address you on a subject which I believe to be necessary and a duty.  During the time I have been laboring here in the Liverpool Office I have observed with anxiety the failing health of our much beloved President, George Teasdale, and have carefully and prayerfully arrived at the conclusion that to withhold the facts in the case longer from you would be dereliction of duty on my part as a servant of God.  Pres. Teasdale had a very severe attack of sickness in February and I do not think that he has fully recovered from the effects of it, and with the care and responsibility incident to his position as President of the European Mission, his health seems to be gradually but surely getting worse.  Of late his affairs at home seem to give him a good deal of anxiety. He feels the loss of Bro. Picton very much, and I understnad that since Bro. Picton's death, Pres. Teasdale's affairs at home are not in a satisfactory condition. The strain upon his mind, under his present bodily condition, seems to be too great and 
 I fear the consequences should he have to continue a great while longer without a change or the rest which he so much needs. I have not arrived at this conclusion merely from my own observations, but the same opinion prevails with all the brethren whom I have conversed with on the subject and also Sister Teasdale. Dr. Phillips, who has been prescribing for and attending to Pres. Teasdale during his sickness, has kindly, at my request, written his opinion in regard to Pres. Teasdale's condition, and I enclose it with this communication.  I have carefully avoided letting Bro. Teasdale know about this letter for fear he might object to it's being sent, and thus withhold the facts in the case from you, that I consider you should be made acquainted with, preferring, like a true and faithful servant of God, anything rather than shrink from his duty.  Hoping you will kindly forgive me for addressing you in this manner, which nothing but a sense of duty would have prompted me to, and ever praying for the blessings of our Heavenly Father to rest upon you and all the faithful I remain  Your humble brother in the cause of Christ Walter Hoge  [sideways text] Walter Hoge 14 June, 1890 Recd July 1 [end of sideways text]

Tho' we were all inex- perienced who were left in this office, business went smoothly on.  Requested you to meet all the Railway fares from your office, for I found that many drafts had been sent to Cover expence of emigrants and we received but little money from them. This last payment to Guion & Co has reduced our finances a little lower than I think they ought to be considering the responsibility this office is under. However you can see from mon- thly statements our true Condition  We are making friends and enemies, but there is not half enough elders in the field; please send us a few score, Plenty room ^for^ good efficient men.  See Bro. Fieldsted concerning efficiency of scan- dinavian elders; his views suit our condition well.  If my son Albert would round up his shoulders he ought to ^be^ called on a mission. My son BS could be very useful to me and we need some one to begin to pick up a knowledge of the clerical business of this office in view of Bro.

This country does not agree with him, but he is uncomplaining and strickly business, and has proved himself an active elder in the field. We releive him of the presidency of the L.pool Conference, calling him to labor in this office.  Some of the elders and many of the saints are much exercised over your manifesto, but more, I think, in giving a sort of credence to the lying reports which are flooding the country concerning what was done at your late conference. My testimony is, that all your acts are in perfect harmony with the revelations of God and I have talked and written, I believe, effectually on this subject. Astonishing how the world mourns over what they they are pleased to call a surrendering of principles on our part.  Love to Prests.

Teasdale proffered to vacate and let me in to which I did not object, but he did not do it. I arrived on the 3rd day of Sept. and Bro. T. moved out on the 4th of Oct I was actually five weeks getting into 42. I cannot let this amount appear against me. I have enumerated most of the expense of sleep- ing and eating, but not all. Now if you choose to meet this extra expense by approprating and sending a draft all right; otherwise I will forward an order on Rossiter to pay you there which can be credited to this office one hundred and fifty dollars. The table expenses, generally, would have meet this amount, during Bro. T's time, and I really think he should have had the extra expense to meet not I. But do what you think is right bethren and shall be satisfied. I await your answer to all my Communications. God bless you forever  Your Brother in Christ Brigham Young.  over 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42. Islington, Liverpool, Sept. 23rd 1890  Prest Woodruff S. L. C. Utah Dear Brother:  My visits to London and Lowestoft and attendance at the Conferences have been pleasant and the Lord is merciful unto us in this Country. At our London Conference it ^is^ said that Jarman mustered his forces just below our hall but did not interefere with our comfort.  The conference at Lowestoft was unusually well attended I am informed, and there were about forty people present. One gentle- man who is investigating the principles of the Gospel came to me after the evening meeting and thanked me for the information he had gained. Our affairs are at a low ebb, no persecution, but an indifference, hard to cope with, seems to have settled upon the people. Lies are flying about and the most insideous come from our own mountain home. Apostates write that, the Govt. has  stopped polygamy but the elders are living openly with young girls marriage or no marriage. I am forcebly impressed with the idea that if an effort were made among the people, instructions sent to the presidents of stakes and ^were to^ they operate with the Bishops Teachers etc energetically, to have the people write to their friends throughout the British mission that good would be accomplished. The people are indiffer- ent in this land but they have an excellent example set them by their friends in Zion. I am satisfied that, quite a commotion would be made among those who have known us long if they could have faithful testimonies from their absent friends. The Lord knows we need help from every good scource. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42. Islington, Liverpool,  189  Don't think me presumptious, brethren, in offering this suggestion, but ^I^ have felt, quite strongly that it was the begening of the finish of this mission, of course I am anxious to have it last but I dont ^beleive^ God will endure perfect indifference ^on the part of the people^ for any great length of time. It seems to me there are thous- ands of people here who must receive the Gospel, good honest souls blinded by the craftiness of men, and my mind is already full of anxiety to know how to teach them. God help His elders, no human power can break the spell which evil has wrought upon the minds of the people.  The greater part of the experienced elders of the mission will soon be released to return home. I feel that we must pray and work harder more hours to fill the vacancy which will be felt throughout the entire mission.  It will be pretty hard upon the president of the mission ^to do^ but it seems actually necessary that he should attend every conference. So much needed instructions to the elders. They drop into curious nooks and corners and run in others ruts without giving the subject thought or due Consederation; and the presthood meetings at these times as the most im- portant of all.  My family is well. Mrs. Y. wishes to be kindly remembered to you all God bless you and give ^you^ every power recquisite to conquor the enemy Love to the brethren  Your Brother in Christ Brigham Young

 Jesse O. Ballenger 24 Dec 1877 Questions regarding eating at one Table  Sunset Arizona Dec. 24th 1877  Pres. John Taylor and the Twelve.  Dear Breathren I feel it will not be amiss to write a few lines to inform you of our present good health and prospects; Knowing the intres you have in this mission. We are at our camp at this time about two hundred souls. All enjoying good health and a plenty of work We work all together as one family and live as near a like as we can. We are building a dining room and are calculating to all eat at the same table like they do at Orderville. But the rumer has come here that the Twelve council otherwise and the brethren do not feel so well united about eating together as they did before and 
 a few words of council from you to us on the subject would be thankfuly received no matter wheather it was to all eat at the  one table or to continue to eat at our own tables as we are I believe your council would be unanimusly caried out.  Bro. Lot Smith has about the same number at his camp that we have. They  eat at the big table and work to gether to same as we do. Bro. Allen has not quite so many at his camp as is at either of the other camps Bro. Lake as joined my camp. They left their place on account of sickness. But are all well at present. We have just started our new thrasher to day and it is doing very well. Bro. Foster from Ogden  thinks he never saw wheat turn out so well. We have about forty acres of fall wheat in at this settlement it looks  well. This is I think a very fine climate, we have had no snow and but little frost it freezes some of nights But is nice and warm through the days. With kind regards I wish to remain as ever  Your Brother in the Gospel Jesse O Ballenger 
 Nov 1 [18]90 B. Young Liverpool Rcd Nov 20 [18]90 In re Missionary  The First Presidency Dear Brethren:  I have sent  a copy of this document to the presi- dents of the Conferences, for quite  a number of them have told me  that there were plenty of ^Young^ men in  their neighborhood ^at home^ who were just  the men for a mission. Brethren  you can see that my intention is good  and I hope this will meet your  minds. I will forward the list I make up from the reports, to you soon as possible. True we need men who will  strike out into new fields, we ^have^ a very few in  the mission who are determined to plow  in old fields, and there are no saints to  saupport that class. In some conferences I find  that retaining drunken people in the church  has, in one instance driven out a fairly good  man and is baring respectable people who are  favorably impressed with ^ the^ doctrines. When all means  are exhausted and they persist in their drunkeness  I have advised their being cut off. I find respecta- ble people in every Conference who are enquiring  into the gospel. Just sunday in stockton on Tees strangers  came in the evening ^to our meeting^ and one young man ^was heard to^ remarked as he went out the door at the close, "I could sit and listen  all night to such talk as that," the first principles of the  Gospel.  Your Brother  B. Y. 
 42, Islington, Liverpool, Nov. 1, 1890. Prest. Elder W. Woodruff  Dear Brother,  There is pressing need for Elders in the  missionary fields in these lands, and believing that you are acquainted  with young men in the wards where you reside, who are financially  and otherwise competent to fill good missions, we desire you to send  such names to us as you honestly suggest, so that we can present  them to the Presidency and Missionary Committee in Zion for their  consideration.  Trusting that what you do will be quietly and properly done, so as not create feeling when names are not acted upon, and  awaiting a prompt reply,  I remain your brother in Christ,  BRIGHAM YOUNG.

Prest. W. Woodruff Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother:  Arrived home  last night twelve oclock. It is cold and snowy  in Scotland. Had an excellent Conference, Hall was  crowded most of them strangers. Sub. Ed. "Glasgow Eve- news," present. He walked home with me after evening  meeting. I received a note from him Mr. Jas. Alex. Kilpat- rick ^this morning^ apologising for his "anti Mormon humour," "I mean no  offense." He proffers to publish any corrections I wish to  make in his report of our Conversation.  I found the brethren in scotland anxiously looking  to L.pool for more elders. The eight ^elders^ that came were not  half enough for scotland alone, and I could spare  them not one. They want thirty to fifty efficient elders.  Openings are being made that must be improved, and  we see them languish for the want of help. Most of  the Conferences I have attended need assistance, elders  who can help themselves and their families not feel  distressed. Many of the brethren have said to me, there  are plenty of Young ^men at home^ in our neighbourhood, who ought to  Come out into the world on missions, and some have  stated that, these efficient Young men were kept at  home by the ward authorities. I am aware that many 
 remained at home to vote, but the enemy is fast re- leasing them and perhaps we can soon turn all of ^our^  attention to preaching the gospel. I have asked the  brethren for lists of names and will send them to you; do not think me too officious in this act, the anxiety  in me may plead for me.  Good tourists have done a wonderful amount of  good, and this class hunt up relatives and introduce  the elders into places and families, not reached heretofore.  Circumstances make it necessary to release Bro Jenk- ins from the scotish mission. Bro Brough is also released,  this leaves but nine elders there. It seems to me that  all the elders are going one way. Have some one advise  me of elders being called and when they will leave. A few  lines will post me.  Where it is possible I have not suffered lies in the  news papers to go unchalenged. Bro Carlisle and I  are now acquainted with parties' connected with the  leading papers here and ^also with^ Mr. Shearman American Con- sul and proffered ^to them^ information concerning our affairs  that they need go astray no more. I am sending the star to these men and places, and have proffered to give them  books if they will read them. Public libraries ought  to be supplied, especially reading rooms so far as we  can consistently, but I leave this to your direction.  We are well and have the old place clean and  comparatively cheerful looking. God bless you. Love to  Prest Geo Q. C. & Jos. F S. and the brethren, ^In^ w^h^ich all join.

 P. S. Mr. Gibson informed me that a word from Bro Jack  would have secured one free passage accross the ocean, as  it was it cost me seventy five dollars. The vessel was not half  full and one word would have saved me this expense. I felt  a little put out as it took my last dollar, John W. gave me  fifty dollars and I got on very well. Prest. Woodruff I would  rather give you every dollar I have on earth than to give  you just cause to censure my financial business with  this office.  Oh yes. Mr. Gibson said, we are sorry that Bro^Mr.^ Jack  did not speak about your affair, but the board could  do nothing only what had been requested but would have  granted free passage for yourself and family had it been re- quested ^by^ Mr Jack  I have had the steps repared and some other  need repairs, if the account is not satisfactory I ask  Bro Cannon to draw the money from estate and pay  it and charge it to me.

 42 Islington L.pool Eng. Nov. 8th 1890  President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City Utah Dear Brother.  Your favor of Oct. 20th came to hand in due course of mail, I am rejoiced to receive this communication from you, it breathes a spirit that finds a congenial echo in my heart and stimulates me to emulate your example in these great and important labors.  I was glad to learn that, Bro. Teasdale accom- plished his journey to Deming so comfortably, and of his improved physical condition, as instanced by his letter to me from that point.  It is I say, very satisfactory for he looked badly emaciated and sorrowful when I saw him last.  It almost gave one the blues to look in- to his sallow countenance, and not until he smiled & talked cheerfully could one eradicate, from his mind, the idea that, he was a much "enduring man."  God go with him in his new field of labors.  His kind heart and faithful labors have endeared him to the saints and they speak of him here as they spoke of him during my late visit to Mexico.  I am thankful for the prospects of more elders coming to our assistance.  God give them courage to push out successfully into new fields, for they shall 
 have that blessed opportunity.  Bro. Metz is an old friend of mine and I deem him a good man; a little impatient perhaps, sometimes, which we may, in charity, call firmness and zeal.  I gladly extend the hand of a brother to the elders especially to Bro. Metz and hope to see them all in the near future.  It will be a pleasure to release Bro. F. A. Brown to re- turn home and I believe Bro. Metz quite equal to the oc- casion.  Tho^se^ who study the Dutch language find it difficult to acquire and young men who are appointed to this mission accomplish but little in the field within two years.  I have written to Bro. Brown to give me his views respecting the prospects of the Holland mission, which report I write furni^s^h to you in due time.  Prests. Cannon & Smith are perfectly familiar with the difficulties elders need in the Holland mission,  I am of the opinion that we need laborers there now, however I am willing to let the Lord dictate in this as in all other matters.  I will look anxiously for elders who are suitable to go to Turkey, but I can say to you now that, we need all the help we now have, and if you have in your mind good efficient men who are natural linguist, 
 I believe they ought to be called and sent to the Turkish mission  We have been discussing the propriety of putting our Milleniael star before the public as other papers are advertized. I can see no impropiity in doing it if we incur no additional expense.  Bro. Teasdale informs me that you appropriated a sum of money to assist in furnishing tracks to the elders; they are quite liberal with their own means in this good work.  You know our condition financially, that is, without your assistance track distributing ^by the elders^ will cease or be very much curtailed, and I am not clear but what the latter maybe the proper thing ^for^ theym to do:  Within the last month two of our brethern have been banished from the Kingdom of Bavaria.  I am quite sure this would not have happened if the principles of the gospel had been understood  by those in authority, even in Bavaria. Our elders would find a great advantage if we were better known, in presenting the gospel ^to strangers^.  We have friends through whom we might reach some of these parties if we cared to take that trouble.  I would much prefer to be represented by my friends then ^by^ my ^by^ enemies.  Bro Carlisle and I have made the acquaintence of many ofthe newspaper men in this city and we feel some confidence that they will treat us with some degree of fairness.  Mr Ranesden has introduced us and he has made a personal request that we be treated as gentlemen should be. 
 If Prest. Geo. Q. Cannon could make us a visit & introduce some of the elders to parties that he can approach, and I think John W. is favorably known to many in this country, and with all the power we can muster we can reach men that overtoss those scrubs who maltreat our elders; 99 times in a hundred simply because they think our brethren have no friends.  I would like to show them to the contrary. The power is in men to do much of themselves and I am sure the Lord has given us a few good friends in this Country I beleive it to be our duty to use every means in our power to conteract the abominable lies which ^are^ spued out of United States and find their way onto this island.  Our policy is to get acquainted, offer to ans- wer respectable questions and give our reasons for the hope we have.  We have had many interesting conversations with strangers.  I hear good reports from many parts of the mission.  Where it is practicable we try to crawl out of the back alleys and slums ^in our Conferences^ and hire halls in more respecta- ble quarters.  Where it can be done it pays in increase of congrega- tion.  Brethren join me in love to you and the brethren as also my family wish to be kindly remembered to you all  Your Brother in Christ Brigham Young

It is impossible for me to write the way I feel about this matter to Bro. Stauffer because I have not the authority to open up that mission as I think now it ought to be done. However, the matter once before you my mind will be at ease in this matter as in all others wsheretofore. I fone of the First Presidency or Lorenzo Snow or any one of the Twelve or anyone else whom you chosose could visit that country and formally open the mission and arrange for the translation and publication of our works as suggested by Bro. S. I am of the opinion that good could be done there. And I am favorably impress ed with the idea of placing ourselves on an equal footing before the law with other Christian denomination; and 
 to avoid complication that it should be done soon as convenient, I have thought strongly of having something of the kind here in this country. It is understood that Christian ministers are licensed and we are more liable to pursecution without license. I shall investi- gate the matter a little more carefully them I have been able to do and if the spirit consents and you do not object obtain license for some one or more of the brethren.  You will pardon my writing so often but this time I am much exercised in spirit in relation to our missionary in Turkey.  We are suffering from colds. The weather is all we don't want, but ^we^ remain comparatively happy.  The brethren join in love. Bro L. Pratt is here ^arriving last night^ the death and sickness in his family have discomposed him to that extent ^and^ he could not work in Paris. He has come to talk with me.  I don't know what his plans are but he feels badly.  Will com- fort ^him^ all I can.  Perhaps he wants to go home.

I thought it would not be wise to delay his release, and therefore sent him word that he has been transferred to the Swiss & German Mission as desired, although I do not at present know of a man to take his place, We have none in England, and I have written J J Scharrer President of the Swiss & German Mission asking him if he has an experienced Elder whom he can recommend, but should he not have a suitable one, perhaps you will suggest what shall be done. Elder Herman is the only

 B. Young  LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.  42 Islington, Liverpool,  Nov. 26th 1890  Prest. Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  Enclose letter from Bro. Stauffer. It speaks for its self; and more, it speaks my mind in relation to the Turk- ish mission. It seems to me that a good work can be done there and if that mission were properly organized, destricted and made more familiar to our minds, I have no reason to doubt there could be great good accomplished.  The colonization scheme was talk- ed of in fathers day and is worthy of consideration in my opinion. 
 But of course I leave all  those matters for your consider- ation. If I am correctly inform- ed Jan & Feb., earlier or a little later, ^either^ would be a good time to visit the Holy land. I put out these ideas as they occur to me.  I go to Ireland on Friday night to attend conference. Ex- pect to return monday. We look for the first company of Elders to arrive on sat. or sun.  We are in very good health and business going on as usual.  God bless and preserve you and overrule the acts of those wolves.  Your Brother in Christ  Brigham Young 
 Prd Woodruff expressed himself honor'd in the privilege of speaking in this meeting. Referred to the subject of brethren wanting to be ordained to higher priesthood &c. Agreed with Bishop Hunter. Spoke of the early part of the church; for three years he acted as Teacher and preached, and built up branches. 
 Wilford Woodruff / said that what he had heard to night was good, for we as a people have got to reform, especially with regard to our commercial matters, was glad to see such a willingness manifested towards relieving the Presidency of some of their burthens; he reminded the Bishops, that many were in the habit of taking their Grain to the Gentiles and trade it off he hoped they would put a check to it as far as they could; he would rejoice to see the day when all Bishops, Missionaries, Presidents, and others will be so far living their religion, and walking up to their duties, that the President could come into their meet ings and rejoice in their midst. Spoke of the n^e^cessity of each one who holds the priesthood acting in their calling, and not to wait for President Young to put his hand upon everything that needs correction, he felt to say to Bishop Hunter, his Counsellors, and the Bishops generally May God bless and speed you, he then spoke of the reformation as being a straightforward and natural thing, there was no mystery about it, but consisted in leaving off every evil practise, and doing better, let us honour every man in his calling, and wherever any man in authority can exercise the spirit of mercy it is good, though it is neccessary to use the rod at times. May God bless you all Amen.  The following "Ordinations" were attended to 
 Wilford Woodruff, desired the Bishops and other authorities to lay their hands upon the brain as far as they can, and pay especial regard to the remarks of Elder Orson Hyde, he then appealed to the Missionaries who had partly waked and desired them to get more of the fire of the Holy Ghost; speaking of the lessor priesthood, he said show me a man who had magnified and honored his calling as a Teacher, and I will show you a mighty man in Israel, there had been such a rush into the quorums of the Seventy's and High Priests, that they had become as black as midnight; he rebuked the practise of taking every little difficulty to the President instead of having them settled by the Priests Teachers &c and he with the rest of the Twelve intended to be after every Quorum, until the fire of God should burn so hot, as to consume all the iniquity that lurks in our midst. 
 Wilford Woodruff was pleased with L. W. Hardy's introducing the Book of Mormon &c into the schools, spoke of his own indefaticable  exertions about a year ago, to wake up an interest among the children in every ward by holding evening meetings with them but owing to the deadness of the parents it was an uphill work and almost labour in vain, speaking of the priesthood he said Bp Hunter was the head of this Bishopric, and he often felt weighed down with something on his mind which he wanted the Bishops to relieve him of, by carrying out his instructions, refered  to the Israelites who had gone so far from God, that they could do nothing without a Law, even to govern them in the smallest things, such was the condition of the world at the present time, spoke of the extent of the priesthood that the Bishops exercised among the people, which was sufficient for almost everything that trans- pired, if the people will do right.  He deprecated the practise of farmers bringing young sheep to the Butchers for slaughter, and desired the Bishops to check it, for the raising of Wool, Hemp, and Flax was of too much importance to be trifled with, for we may rest assured, that we shall be under the necessity of sustaining ourselves, and that very soon. contrasted the law of the priesthood with the laws of the Territory, by one of which everybody had to be governed. 
 Wilford Woodruff, suggested as a preventive against the brethren getting behind hand in their tithing, viz for every one to pay it at the very time of raising, and in every kind that is raised, he also suggested that Bro McRae be appointed a Bishop of the 11th Ward, with the view of relieving the excess- ive burthen now upon the shoulders of Bro Hardy. 
 Wilford Woodruff backed up the sentiments just advanced, he felt that it was the duty of the Bishops to attend to their temporal duties, which was the leading ideas of Bp Hunter, the responsibilities resting of the Bishops are great, especially as so many of the brethren are now taking more wives, they will require at your hands much council on the principle of obedience, for unless children are taught to be obedient to their parents, they will be come poor Husbands and wives. It was the duty of the Twelve that are at home to follow the example of Prest B Young to walk into the different quorums to give instruction, and see how things are going on, for it was not only their right, but God required it at their hands; he wished the Bishops would hold on to the members of the quorums of Priests, Teachers and Deacons that are good for anything, and not allow them to go off into the seventys until they have magnified their calling in the lessor priesthood, but he deprecated a contentious spirit between the different quorums, as to which was the greatest, this had been a bone of contention since the beginning, and ought to be put a stop to, after giving some valuable instruction on this subject, he prayed that God would bless us all. 
 Wilford Woodruff, stated there was a vacancy in the history of the church, for at least 3 months immediately after the death of Joseph, and if any present can furnish anything either from memory or Journal that transpired during that period, will please forward the same to the Historians Office, referring to the reformation, he said the Lord had forgiven us for what was past, but after rebaptism, should the people again sin in Israel, the Law would undoubtedly be put in force, for it was impossible that people could henceforth sin with impunity, for he well knew that Prest Young would never appear before us again in that merciful consideration, which he has done of late, refered to the great blessings that belonged to the lessor priesthood, especially the ministration of angels, and strongly deprecated a spirit of contention that had been more or less manifest for the last 14 years, and recommended each one to realize the respon sibility that rested on them, let their calling be what it may, mentioned the power of the priesthood that was manifest in several instances in Nauvou, where the sick and dying lay about in all directions, and Joseph rose up and shook himself, and commanded every one of them to rise up, and they were healed forthwith, he also spoke of other instances where the wicked were Kept at Bay, and were made to Quake and fear at the words of the Lord through his Servants Joseph, Brigham, and David Patten, spoke of the clouds that were gathering ahead of us, and the necessity of each one being in readiness both Temporally and Spiritually, that we may have the blessing and approbation of God. 
 W. Woodruff, felt interested, he had seen a reformation in every meeting he now attended, there was a different spirit and atmosphere altogether, to what there was last year, spoke of the principle of submission to the priesthood, that existed here in this King dom, which could not be found among any people on the face of the earth, he refered to the example that the Saviour set us in this thing, by patiently enduring the most abject poverty and deprivation of every kind, surrounded by bitter persecution &c all in obedience to the priesthood, there was not one out of a thousand in this Territory that would refuse to obey the council of President Young, and while we as a people continue to take this course, we shall be surrounded with blessing all the time, the world knows nothing of this principle, but rather indulge in a disposition to devour each other, he then spoke of the importance of the twelve having the same spirit as was in President Young, and as He could not be personally present in the various quorums, wherever the twelve went, they should be able to do just as He would, were he present, after giving much instruction and encouragement, he prayed that God would bless them.  D. Fulmer, was delighted to contemplate the change that had been brought about among the saints, especially in the absence of all difficulties, for he had not heard of one either with the Bishops or any one else for a long time, whereas some time ago, not only the Bishops, but the High Council and the Presidency had piles of them. 
 Wilford Woodruff, believed the saints would have just as much to do in this world, and in that which is to come, as ever we are capable of performing, and so far from supposing we had come here to rest, his past experience had thoroughly converted him from that doctrine, he spoke of the importance of every Elder in Israel keeping a Journal or History of things as the transpire, at the first organization of the Twelve apostles,  The Prophet Joseph said he had suffered much sorrow of heart, for not writing or caused to be written the dealings of God with this people, he said also, whenever you Quorums meet, be sure you always have a clerk to record all your decisions, if you don t, the Lord will be angry with you  Bro. Woodruff remarked that he had himself kept a Journal for the last 24 years, and daily recorded his doings and whereabouts, and much of what he had heard from the Prophet Joseph and the Twelve, he then strongly urged on the Bishops to keep an account of how they spend their time, which would form an important History in Generations to come &c 
 Bro W. Woodruff, hoped the people would take care of what sheep we now have, there had been such neglect heretofore, and consequently great loss and destruction which had made his heart sick he hoped the Brethren would take more care of them, on Tithing he said he had been in the Storehouse and seen the immen[se] quantity of Grain, and if a few more Teams came in [,] the bins would run over. 
 Elder Woodruff spoke of the importance of Bishops watching especially at the present time as there were many gathering between the Mountains to go East. there had been a span of Horses taken away last night at the West Mountain, the Lariats had been cut and the Animals were missing, he exhorted the Bishops to watch and for them to set others to watch also, and as far as  possible dont allow any one to go away in debt either to the Emigrating Fund or any one else for it was nothing but right that people should pay their debts before they are allowed to go away. 
 Elder Wilford sustained the remarks and  sentiments of Prest Young, and was glad that the time had come, when the Elders on missions would be sustained  with funds by the people here instead of the poor saints abroad.
