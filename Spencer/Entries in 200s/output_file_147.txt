Thrones have been cast down, whole  Kingdoms have been overturned, the power of the Pope of Rome  laid prostrate &amp; he driven from his Kingdom. All the nations of  the Earth convulsed Revolutions, wars anarchy &amp; confusion follow  each other in rapid succession, Cholera, plagues, &amp; famine follow  in the train. And last of all though not least in importance  is the foundation laid for the disolution of the American  Government while these things are going on the Jews are gather- ing home to rebuild Jerrusalem, some 7000 Latter Day Saints  have gatherd into the valley of the mountains of Israel by the  valley of the Sacramento  have discoverd vast quantites of Gold, silver, coper Iron &amp; other  mettels the report of which has spread like electricity through  through the world which is causing tens of thousands of the  world to flock to that place these are some of the features  of the signs of 1848  The revolutions of France.

The people then undertook to esstablish a republican  government, it was said to be ownly 500 killed in the first 3 days  fight Afterwords a reaction took place with a fight &amp; some  15000 killed, they have finally organized, and the world are now looking  Daily for the account of their electing a President and it is expected  by many that much blood will be shed on the occasion in consequence  of the many conflicting Parties. The Prusia next  follow in Revolution which is still unsetled. Next the People of  Austria arose and Drove the King from his Throne &amp; Kingdom He  afterwards returned with Armies and bombarded Vienna 8 days  and regained his Kingdom but has been driven to the necessity of  giving his people a milder form of government &amp; more toleration  still his Throne is in danger.

While this is going on in for- eign Countries let us turn our eyes for a moment to the Position of Blood Stained America. A Nation though blessed above all  other Nations under Heaven yet she has of late been guilty of sheding  the Blood of Apostles Prophets Patriarchs and Saints she has suffered  mob rule to take the place of Constitution law &amp; order and what  position is she in at the Close of this year, not ownly one of her states Ohio has disgraced herself by having a legislaton sit for   ENDENTRY  organizing &amp; doing the business of the people, but the leaders of the  whole Nation itself at Washington are engendering the spirit of party  strife, hatred disunion &amp; war meeting in seperate parties and  laying plans for the dissolving of the Union and the anhilation  of the American Government. And James Gordon Bennett of  the New York Herald &amp; other Editors after Prophesying month after  month that their was no danger of disolving our union are with  all their prophesies recorded in their paper stareing them in the  face, under the necessity of recording the account of the parties  ways and means made use of to accomplis &amp; bring to pass the vary things they have been prophesying against. And while the Senators  &amp; Statesman of the Slave states meet in convention and resolve that  if slavery in the Distrect of Columbia is abolished or prohibited  from Calafornia that they will immediately dissolve  the Union, lay taxes upon the shiping of the free States &amp;c At the  same time Citizens and Statesmen of the free states meet in conven- tion and Resolve if these things are not done they in like manner  will dissolve the Union. While these parties are growing more &amp;  more determined, &amp; further &amp; wider apart. Still the public mind  seems to be blinded as to the result of these resolutions, and are  ignorant concerning the fruit which will be produced by the seed of there own sowing yes they have "eyes but see not, ears but hear not &amp;  hearts but do not understand" while the servent of God  inspiration, can behold the scene in its true light and knows well  the result, with as much certainty as Lot, and Jesus,  did each in their day while gazing upon the conduct of the Anted- eluvians, Sodom &amp; Gomorrow, or the inhabitants of Jerrusalem and  as the words of the Lord were fulfilled in the former case in like  manner will they in the latter. ##Matthew 13:15## During the past year the Asiactic  cholera one of the plagues of the last days has also again commenced  its march through the Earth slaying its tens of thousands. it has now  made its appearance in Scotland and has just arived  in the United States is in Memphis  and Cincinnati the last report states about  the signs of the gathering of the Jews has been vary prominant during  the past year, the governments of the world have in some measure been  exherted to favor that people.

Brother Edington took the supervis- ion of the whole triming of the House. President Young arived at about 11 oclok He called upon me to offer the Dedication  Prayer       Morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to Dedicate this House unto Thee, and we ask for thy Holy Spirit to bring all things to our rememberance which may be ne of this House. We dedicate the Foundation of this building together  with the ground upon which it stands that it may be Holy from  the commencement to the name of Most High. We dedicate the Foundation with the rock Mortar and timbers and all things appertaining thereto that it may be Holy unto the Lord. We dedicate the walls of this House with the adobies, the mortar and every t dedicate the door with the Joists boards and nails thereof that the same may be Holy unto Thee. We also dedicate the windows with the sash, glass putty and every thing pertaining thereto  also the curtains with the trimings ^thereof^ and the shades that they may be Holy unto the the Hinges screws locks, latches, and every thing pertaining thereto that they may be Holy unto Thee the Lord our God. We dedicate the Roof with the rafters, boards, shingles, lath, nails   ENDENTRY  Plastering, cornice, ornamental work and all things  appertaining thereto that Evry thing may be Holy and consec- rated unto Thee. We dedicate the stand the pulpit the seats the floor the Boards the paint and evry thing belonging thereto also the Benches and seats in this room that they may be Holy unto the Lord. And we pray that this dedication, may  be acceptable, that this house and the ground whare on it stands may be Holy unto Thee, and we ask that thy Blessings may rest  upon the Bishops and Priests and Elders who may occupy this  stand that they may be inspired to speak unto the Edifycation of this people and that they may magnify the Holy Priesthood given unto them. And we pray that this House may be clean and every thing clean and pure which dwells therein O God the Eternal Father we dedicate this House unto thee and thy Kingdom for the purpose of Preaching, teaching,  instruction, singing &amp; prayer, and for the teaching of Our  Children, and for Lawful and innocent recreation. we pray that thy protecting care may be over this House, that it may be  protected from fire and winds, and Every Evil Element And O God we pray that the spirit and power of darkness may have no dominion here, That thy saints may inherit  this place in peace, that no Enemy may have power in  this House. And should the day Ever come that the Enemies of thy Saints should have dominion in this Land grant that this Building may be destroyed from the foundation and not one stone left upon another that the wicked and unholy may  never inherit this House, nor this City nor any of the Houses of thy Saints which have been dedicated unto thee Grant to accept of this dedication we beseech of Thee that thy spirit may  rule and reign in this House, and may thy saints not worship this House nor any thing appertaining to this Earth, But may they worship the Lord of Hosts and help do thy will and Esstablish thy kingdom upon the Earth. And if anything there be pertaining to this Building or the ground upon which it stands that we have not named before thee Grant that it may be Holy, that all things pertaining thereto with the dedication thereof may be acceptable unto Thee  which we ask in the name of Jesus Christ our Redeemer Amen   ENDENTRY Dec 24 1861 At the close of the Dedication Prayer President Young addressed  the saints the following are some of the remarks which he made FIGURE He said as I have the privilege of speaking I hope I ma actuated by the spirit of intelligence. As Brother Woodruff has asked the Lord in his prayer so I feel to say amen to the whole  of it even to the destruction of the Buildings if our Enemies ever had power to possess it. But I do mot think  ever be driven from this inheritance I am satisfied we never shall be if we live our religion &amp; do our duty. Here we are gathered together from all the Nations of the Earth, like the net  cast into the sea it gathers both good &amp; bad and each one works  out what is in him. While Brother Woodruff was offering the  dedication Prayer I was wondering if they dedicated there  School Houses anciently. They dedicated Solomons Temple but  I dont know as they did there School Houses But we should dedicate ourselves and all we have unto the Lord. We still have some  among us who still wish to mingle with the wicked they still want to introdue Mr Devil to me &amp; to this people and such wood  hender the progress of the kingdom of God. I am pleased to meet with you here to day. I see the taste which you have displayed in the finishing of this house which I like and admire. Pardon me for quoting a remark of a man from the north in see the 13 ward Assembly rooms proped up to keep them from falling down. He said the glory of the Bishop of the 13 ward  had departed. But I hope the glory of the Bishop of the  14 ward will not depart as did the 13 ward I hope this  House will not fall down. I am pleased to see that you have brought together the Elements which surround you and Erected  a Beautiful Hall which is a pleasure to meet in. Even the  most wicked take pleasure in beholding that which is beautiful  &amp; lovely. I delight to meet here my soul is full of Blessings  for this people. we are living in a world of sin yet we are approaching to the light and travelling together as Latter  Day Saints we should dedicate our all to God. The gospel of  Jesus Christ is to make good men better and to put them  in a position to receive Joy and glory to the fullness   ENDENTRY Dec 24 of the capacity of man. Many Elders pray that they may  may have confidence in God. But I pray that I may live so that God may have confidence in me I think it folly to pray that I may have confidence in God for He is right all the  time and if we will live so that he may have confidence  in us we will do well. It is our duty to make all the  improvement we can while we live. All that we see here  on the Earth is a similitude of what is in heaven. we have the Elements all around us to beautify &amp; adorn zion  but we should not set our hearts upon Gold or silver or  any thing upon Earth But sanctify the Lord in our Hearts  then we shall partake of Eternal life. I say to the 14 ward  if you occupy this House in the fear of God it will prove a  Missouri  we had to walk up &amp; sign a Deed of trust to pay the Expenses of the mob in driving out the saints they said  Jo Smith could not make the saints consecrate but we can  make them consecrate. The saints here complained of paying a little tax and a little tithing money I dont know  but the Lord will let us pay a little money tax to the Devil the  Government requires a direct tax of some $27,000 dollars  When you have parties in this House dont admit drunken  men into it. another principle I wish to speak of if the  Bishop wishes to invite a Gentile in dont let the people complain about it for when a Gentile comes in here and the priesthood  rules the Gentiles can do no hurt, But Let an Elder or any latter Day Saints go &amp; attend a party among the Gentiles  whare they reign and it is vary different that would be  rong. we should never bow down to the wicked we should never  descend but asscend &amp; try to Elevate others to our standard     our History and improvements, and they come here Expecting to accomplish that which they will not do. Most of the officers  which the Government have sent here are a Hiss and a By word  and a stink in the nostralls of all good men and there never was a wickeder man than the President of the United States   ENDENTRY Dec 24  and so are his associates vary wicked men. I hop we will  strive to magnify our lives which God has given us, for we shall either go on to life Everlasting, or descend to Everlasting  destruction. if we were all pure in heart as we should  be we would have p them as we now do. Now go to &amp; dedicate your hearts &amp;  your houses and all you have unto God.
