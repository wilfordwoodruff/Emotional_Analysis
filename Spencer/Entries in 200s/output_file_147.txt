 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42, Islington, Liverpool,July 11th 1890.President W. Woodruffand Council.Beloved Brethren:As I was pre-paring to leave for Cheltenham to attend theBristol Conference, your esteemed favorof the 27th came to hand. I must sayit was a surprise to me as I was not look-ing for it until the fall at the end of theEmigration season. But I am a minuteman and go and come at the call of myfile leaders, for I have but one desire in lifeand that is to be where my heavenly Fatherwishes me to be. This mission has been ablessing to me and I am thankful to Himfor the experience. Last Sunday I attendeda very good Conference and Priesthood meet-ings at Birmingham, and on Sunday weekwe have a Conference of the Welsh Mission.I have received a letter from Bro. J. Jackabout an extra charge being made in thefare from Copenhagen. I have sent the letterto Prest Fjeldsted for explanations. There arealways two sides, and frequently much mis-representations, that it is always better tohear both sides before judging. I am thankful 
 to say my health is good and I am en-joying my mission. I preached the gospelyesterday to a gentleman who was here inthis room for two hours and three quarters.When I return from Cheltenham I willwrite you again, as I am a little hurriedthis morning to take the noon train. Ihave been so busy since receiving yourletter I have had no time to think. So youwill kindly excuse this hasty epistle andrest assured I shall have pleasure incarrying out your councils to the best ofmy poor endeavor.With kind love to you allbelieve me very affectionatelyYour brother in tribulationGeorge Teasdale[sideways text] Geo.

Your suggestions about an organization, as the brethren had at Ann Arbor will be suggested to them and I hope be productive of much good. The action of the U. S. officials with regard to our emigration was brought to my notice in the press dispatches of the morning papers and I wrote to Mr Tenbroeck, a copy of which I enclose. I hope our emigration, under the blessing of God, will not be interfered with.We are striving to be in harmony with the laws but it seems as though the U. S. Government was determined to fill up their cup speedily. Our emigration is very nicely cared for everywhere. Mr Ramsden continues as energetic and careful as ever to have our emigrants well treated.I do not know how such a rumour could have reached you that I had released Elder Frederick Stauffer from the Turkish Mission

[end of sideways text]LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42 Islington, LiverpoolJune 20th 1890.President Wilford Woodruff,and Council.Beloved Brethren:Yesterday I hadto cable you for ten hundred pounds in conse-quence of the heavy drafts made upon us anda mistake in not drawing sufficient upon youfor the fourth Company. I was afraid we wouldnot have sufficient to pay Guion & Co for the seapassage of the June 28th Company and draftswere continually being presented and the moneywanted and our emigration being at a standstill until the 2nd of August I saw we weregoing to be bankrupt, and so cabled for tenhundred, owed us by the office, to save us.Mssrs Guion & Co have just informed us that theWyoming arrived safe in New York yesterdaymorning the 19th at 5 a.m. and that they left at3 p.m. the same afternoon. We are rejoicing inthe blessing of God attending our companies.In conversation with Mr. Ramsden I told himI did not know but what we would have toquit sending companies. He asked why? donot they go through all right? I replied yesbut there is so much prejudice against usand the people of the States so stirred up by 
 as I had not thought of such a thing. Brother Stauffer is quietly doing as well as any miss-ionary who ever went to Turkey. I have for-warded him your letter, with a letter from myself and enclosed a five pound note to assist him in expenses. In this weeks "Star" which will [be] issued next Monday there is an inter-esting letter from him under date of May 17th. It bears postmark of a later date and would have been published earlier but I have been away attending conferences and visiting. Bro. J. E. Carlisle is away with br. Heber J. Richards & family visiting London. Bro. Phillips is assisting me on the "Star" He leaves on the 28th of June for Bear Lake. He has been quite a help to me in the editorial department. He has an excellent education and is a gentleman, but I think rather a fierytemper when crossed. His expressions have to be toned down, andbut with me he has been as humble as a child, and treated me with a great deal of respect. I am sorry to lose him, and he expresses sorrow to leave. But the way has opened up for his emigration and I would not detane him. If he continues in the love of the gospel and true humility he will be a great blessing to himself, and likely others.We all join in kind love; the folks at 42 are all well. Ever praying for the blessing of God to attend you now and for ever, Your humble brother in the CovenantGeorge Teasdale

Woodruff & Council.Salt Lake City, Utah.Beloved Brethren:On friday last, 20th inst, the following named missionaries arriv-ed in Liverpool, per Guion S. S. Wisconsin. They spent Sunday with us and were appointed to the Conferences named as follows Frederick W Chappell, to the Manchester; James H. Clark and Richard Grahamto Leeds; John F. Merrill, Samuel S. Newton and Edmund M. Dugdale to Newcastle; Thomas Wheatley Jr. andCharles Cottrell Jr to Sheffield; Charles T. Black and Prime Coleman to Norwich; Henry Moyle to Bris-tol; James Smith to London & Edward Burton to the Nottingham Conferences; and James H. Cook to the Scottish Mission. These were all for the British Mission. Anders S. Hyrup for the Scandinavian and Joseph A. Young for the Swiss & German Mis-sion.On Saturday 21st June Elders George H. Baugh and wife, Hyrum Ricks and Noah Williams returned home per Guion S. S. Alaska, R. F. Neslen, W. Langton & F. T. Bailey with their wives and some others going to Utah sailed on the same vessel.You referred to Prest J. U. Stucki being released if we had any one to succeed him. There is only Brother 
 the newspapers against our emigration. He smiled"oh never mind that" he said "when you cannotsend companies then we will have to trysome other way." "You do not send emigrantsin violation of law," no paupers no contract la-borers do you? he said "No" I replied. He thentold me of an interview he once had with theAmerican Consul in Liverpool when Enarts triedto stop the emigration and the Consul asked him ifthe "Mormons" were of the above class &c. He is cheerfuland sanguine, has good faith our people will gothrough all right so long as they honor the laws. Thiswe propose to do by the grace of God and continue totrust in Him. It is His work and He will over-rule all things to suit His glorious will. My onlyanxiety is that His will may be done and Hispuposes fulfilled. I think we are safe if we do Hiswill and keep His commandments. I believe in Hispromise "If you love me and keep my commandmentsyou shall prosper in the land" [##2 Nephi 4:4##] Every Latter-day Saintsknows this to be true and they are full of thankfulness,light & truth. Tomorow Elders Hyrum Ricks, NoahWilliams and Geo. H. Baugh return to Zion per S. S. AlaskaBrother Baugh's wife has been here on a visit returns withhim. Bros R. F. Neslen, Wm Langton & wife Bailey &wife, Wm. Knowles, Bro Baugh's wifes brother, Eliza Jones and somerelatives of Wm Langton & wife are going to accompany this partyof returning missionaries and visitors. All seem to have been benefited by their trip. We are all well at 42 and join in kind loveYour brotherGeorge Teasdale. 
 Theo. Brandley and if he was taken from the office to preside, he would need some one to succeed him. Bro Stucki spoke of a brother residing at Elsinore who was very capable. His name is Richard Haag. He also said he could use twelve good missionaries in the Swiss and Ger-man mission if he had them. There has been a revival in that mission where good competent Elders are. We all want good competent Elders; like everything else there is always room at the top. The Elders generally ^when they arrive here^ do not know much about the principles themselves, and by the time they learn to teach others, and are useful in the ministry, it is time for them to go home; especially is this so where they have to learn the language. If it meets your approbation Prest Stucki will leave for home with the next company from the Swiss and German mission, and Bro. Brandley will be ap-pointed to succeed him. Elder C. D. Fjeldsted ar-rived here November 13th 1886 and Elder Jas. Leaing October 13th, 1886. Will you kindly inform me if you think they should return home. They are bootth very excellent missionaries and of course we hate to part with them, and they are willing to stay until it is deemed wisdom for them to re-turn. I would like your council on the matter that I may be satisfied. Men in the enjoyment of the Holy Spirit only want to be where the Lord wants them, and they have joy in their missions despite the dis-couraging circumstances. Your brother,George Teasdale

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42, Islington, Liverpool,August 13th 1890.President Wilford Woodruff,and Council.Beloved Brethren:I have the honorof submitting to you, by this mail, our month-ly statement, for the past month, July.Since receiving your esteemed favor of June 27,and later communications, we have endeavoredto fulfil your expressed wish, to arrangethe affairs of the mission, so that when oursuccessor arrived, we could turn over the bu-siness of the mission to him, and make allthe necessary explanations concerning itsdetails &c. This will account for our dis-bursements being rather heavy during thelast month. We paid Fazakerleys bookbindingbill of  96.12.0, our takxes  9.15.4, House cleaningWhitewashing &c  4.3.5, Gasbill  2.6.4, Coal  2.10.6 andso forth. We shall do our best to have every-thing in good shape to turn over to our suc-cessor, all bills paid, and the house clean andcomfortable. We were very much pleased withyour reconsideration of the brother who shouldsucceed me, and acknowledge the hand of Godin it. I am thankful for the kindly consider-ation you have had for me, and very much 
 appreciate your friendship and brotherly love.I am very thankful to God for His sustaining grace.Notwithstanding all the anxieties, cares andtribulations, I have enjoyed the experience ofthis mission exceedingly, and what little goodmay have been done, to God be the glory.  Wehave sought His counsel and He has guided.The broadcast distribution of tracts and printed matter will be like the "bread cast uponthe waters," already do we hear of a spirit ofinquiry being madenifest. I have good faith inprinters ink. The Lord is doing His own work,and it is not by wisdom of man, but by HisSpirit is He accomplishing His mighty purposes.It is a great pity there are so few who believe God.I shall be pleased to receive any instructionsyou may have for me as to my future. Weare all reasonably well at 42, and joinin love to yourselves, our brethren of the Twelve,and the brethren with you in the office. Maypeace and blessing be thineYour brother in the Kingdom of patienceGeorge Teasdale[sideways text] Geo. Teasdale13 Aug. 1890 [end of sideways text] 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42 Islington, Liverpool,July 19th 1890.President W.

There were 9 Elders from Utah present.On Tuesday evening we held a fellowship meeting whichwas well attended and a number of interestingtestimonies borne. On Wednesday I returned to the officeand met Elders Lorus Pratt, John Hafen and J. B.Fairbanks en route to Paris and James J. W. Duncanwho arrived in Liverpool on Saturday night the12th inst per Guion S. S. Nevada. They were all in ex-cellent health and spirits. They met with us atour Wednesday evening meeting and we had an ex-cellent testimony meeting. Afterwards we met in theprayer room at 42 Islington and Elder LorusPratt was appointed the president of the FrenchMission and set apart for that responsibility.So we have a representation in France. ElderDuncan was appointed to labor in the ScottishMission. I was acquainted with him when he wasa boy about 8 years of age in Scotland. His fatherpresided over the Tranent Branch of the EdinburghConference in 1859 and 60; he emigrated to Utah and died 
 there. Now his youngest son 38 years of age is going tobear his testimony in the place where once his fathersvoice was heard in defence of the Everlasting Gospel.With this mail you will receive the financialreport of the mission for June. Bro. Jno W. Youngarrived this morning from London with DavidH. Cannon and Willie Young. They leave to-day byCunard S. S. Umbria, all well. Bro. EdwardBurton of the late arrival of missionaries returnshome dreadfully homesick. We cannot pursuadehim. His President, Bro. Creer of Notts, and the Eldersthere have labored with him but of no avail.He cannot endure it. He leaves by S. S. Nevadato-day. I leave to-day for Merthyr to attend aConference of the Welsh Mission and priesthoodmeeting to night. We are all well at 42 and joinin kind love to the First Presidency and Twelvewhom we sustain in our entreire confidenceand faith and prayers night and morningand whom may the God of Israel bless forever and for everAffectionately your brotherin the Kingdom of patienceGeorge Teasdale[sideways text] Geo.

Woodruff,and Council.Beloved Brethren:We have just witnessedthe departure of the 6th Company, of this seasons emi-gration, per Guion S. S. Wisconsin, in charge of ElderLeonard J. Jordan, with Isaac J. Riddle as his firstand John D. Evans as his second counsellor. EldersEdward M. Perkins and Robert Harmon returningmissionaries. The last named returning at his ownrequest through family affairs, and declining health.It is a small company of 81 souls and 4 returningmissionaries 85 Total 45 full and 19 half fares. 45males and 40 females. We instructed Elder Jordon totelegraph Elder Jas. Jack from New York, Norfolk,Chattanooga, Kansas City and Denver. We haveto give the brethren in charge all instructions, asit is a new business, or experience, to them. Peoplewho are engaged in a business, that time andexperience have made them proficient in, areapt to forget there was a time when they wereignorant of it, and think all men shouldhave the knowledge they themselves possess. As ageneral rule we know the Presidents are ignor-ant of what is required of them in taking a com-pany of emigrants through to Utah, and are careful 
 to give them all necessary information, as theirs is alabor of love, and we are anxious for the Saints to goin peace and safety. If we fail it is because we maybe too confident in the ability of the President, andthink he knows more than he really does. EldersJohn R. Booth, Smith Wells Robertson and JosephShipley arrived here on Thursday last, the 31st ult.I was hoping you would have sent us morehelp. 12 missionaries who came in 1889 & 1890 for theBritish Mission have returned through ill health, or othercauses, who should be useful in this mission to-day, andwho were calculated upon, so we are short that numbernow. Then we have some ten elders who came in 1888who expect to be released this fall. We have only 8Elders in Wales now, we had twenty at one time, and shouldhave 16 or 18 at least if that mission is to be kept up.We have only 4 Elders in Ireland, we should have 6 or 7.We have only 9 Elders in Scotland we should have 11 or 12 atleast. So we will want 3 for Scotland 3 for Ireland 8 for Wales and 10 for England as soon as we canhave them. We are all well at 42. The printersgone for their holiday. Elder J. E. Carlisle for a weeks out. Bro. Hoge and myself at the office.Brs. John W. ^F^ Squires is coming to assist us in theoffice during the emigration and to improve hishealth as a change from so much walking. Weall join in kindest regards to the Presidency andtwelve and remainYour brother in the gospel,George Teasdale.

We had excellent meet-ings which were well attended, but the reportswere not very encouraging with regard to bap-tisms. In the Welsh Mission they had not baptizedone in six months, but in Scotland two baptismswere reported, for the six months, and six baptismsin July, since the 30th of June. In the six months 15,531tracts had been distributed, 26 of the cheap edition ofthe Book of Mormon had been sold, and 189 cheap Voiceof Warning. In the Scottish Mission 13,265 tracts had beendistributed by the Glasgow Tract Society, in six months,and 14,619 by the Elders &c in their districts for three monthsreport, making a total of 27,884 tracts distributed, 11 Booksof Mormon sold, 5 loaned, 13 Voice of Warning sold, 8 loaned, 5 givenaway by the Elders, to friends or acquaintance. There is a seeming indifference amongst the people generally, or ifconvinced lack the moral courage to obey; Yetthe Elders are in no wise discouraged, they feelwell, and we hade most excellent meetings. Theand ^elders^ are filled with praise and thanksgiving.There seems to be a deep rooted prejudice against 
 us, and frequently the Elders are insulted, the people re-fusing to receive the tracts, or hold any conversationwith them. The Protestants and Catholics are holding"Demonstrations" in the open air, and in the largesthalls. Last Sunday on Glasgow Green there was a protes-tant demonstration, and they had to be protected bysquads of policeman, which we saw march downto the foot of the Nelson Monument, on Glasgow Green.We live in a momentous age.Your favor of June 30 reached us after Elder Jas.

 The Council of the Twelve Apostles, to the Breth-ren at Winter Quarters, and esspecially tosuch as shall hereafter arrive at thatplace GreetingBeloved Brethren,We have nowcompleted the organization of the Pioneer Company, of which we are members, and whom we areabout to lead to the Mountains or over the Moun-tains, as we shall be councilled by our Leader insearch of a resting place for ourselves, our families,and all who desire to follow us and work Righteous-ness; and by doing this we prove to you and to allthe world, that we do not wish to be a whit behindthe first of you, in leaving wife, children, friends, rest, or any of the enjoyments of social life; and that weare willing to take our full share of troubles, trials,losses and crosses, hardships and fatigues, wearinessand watchings, for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake; andwe feel to say come calm or strife, turmoil or peace, lifeor death; in the name of Israel's God we mean to conquer or die trying: We mean to open up the wayfor the salvation of the honest in heart from all na-tions or sacrifice every thing in our stewardship, andif we fail in the attempt, having done all we could,Our Father will not leave his flock without a Shep-herd.In connection with the Pioneer Company wehave organized all in your place and vicinity whowish to join the emigration, into companies of Tens, fifties, and hundreds, in two divisions, with a President 
 and two Councillors to each division, with the sanctionof their respective companies, and having called thePresidents, Councillors, and Captains of hundreds to-gether, have advised with them and decided thatall the High Council that is necessary to be leftat Winter Quarters, after the present High Councilshall have left, will be the Presidents and Captainsof Emigration Companies.  And where the present Pres-idents of Divisions and Captains shall remove theywill leave others similarly organized with the approvalof the brethren, or those who thus enter into the organiza-tion.The brethren now organized, have heardthe Word and the Will of the Lord on which this organ-ization is founded and have given their hearty assentunto it, and any hesitancy in carrying out their pledgesor acting in Concert with their Presidency, as they wellknow will be at the loss of a glory that they ^can^ never regain, therefore, we say that that these instructions generallyare more especially to such as shall hereafter arrive at your place; so that they may receive the principles andinstructions that those have had, who have been with us the past winter.The business of the Saints at WinterQuarters from this time is to journey West, until furtherinstructions: and while some will have the means to go forward at the springing of grass, others will have to stop and raise grain to carry with them: andwhile some will come here prepared, others will havestop and prepare for their journey: and in either case, all preparation and organization is for journeying andnot for a permanent location at Winter Quarters, and if any refractory members should make their appear- 
 ance, the Bishops will see that justice is done them, and let no iniquity have place in your midst.It is the privilege of the brethren whoremain, or arrive hereafter, to decide, but the Councilurgently recommends to them to remove the lesser houseson to the line, of Winter Quarters, or on the borders of themost populated blocks, so as to defend themselves, byhouses, pickets, ditches, &c against the Indians, so thatyour women and children may not be insulted andabused, and their tables robbed, while they are draw-ing water, or gathering the fruits of their gardens orattending to any domestic duties, in your absence.Let the brethren labor unitedly in makingfields, fencing, planting, harvesting &c all under the di-rection of their respective captains of Tens and Fifties, -over whom will be the supervision of their Captains ofhundreds and Presidents who will allot to each familyall the ground they need or can till, for a garden, inthe City of Winter Quarters or its immediate vicinity so that all may share equally in the comforts and luxuries of the table.The Idler shall not eat the breadof the laborer, therefore let a record be kept, by the Captains of each Ten, or his clerk, how each man em-ploys his time, from day to day; and let the same bereported weekly to the Clerk of the division or Presi-dency of the organization; and let one tenth of theavails of each man's labor be appropriated for thebenefit of the poor and sick, under the direction of theBishops, attending to the Council of the Presidency; forthe poor ye have always with you, and the sick often:and he who administers to them, serveth the Lord.Your crops, and cattle will be exposed 
 to the aggression of the Omahaws, and other Indians, andwe say to you take care of them, learn to watch aswell as pray, for the farther you go West, the more you will be exposed and if the Saints cannot watchthem safely here here, what will they do when they get where civilzation or half civilization is unknown. Make good fences around your corn fields, and locatefamilies near sufficient to watch and keep them safe, and let the emigrants be diligent and careful to plow, plant, and fence all they possibly can before theystart on their journey.We advise the brethren to keep theup the a police of their most effective men at WinterQuarters as we have done for  [th] in an hour ye knowthink not, evil may be upon you; and pray themfor their services so that they will not be obliged toneglect your safety, for a loaf of bread, to satisfytheir hunger or that of their families.It is highly important in thisdispensation that every brother learns his duty, and acts accordingly: in doing which, every one whocan, will pay their herdsmen in money, flour, grain, &c as they shall need, for their comfort, or to prosecutetheir journey, and not complete compel them to urgepayment of the Sisters whose husbands are in the army, the Widows, and poor, and let the herdsmenbe diligent in striving to deliver all the cattle &c entrust-ed to their charge, at the proper time, to those whoare emigrating West, and such of those, as cannotpay down, agree upon the Cattle you shall markas your own to be held in society, to be paid for ordelivered to you at a future day. 
 It is our wish and Council that the Em-igration company now formed, shall follow the Pioneers,as soon as the grass is sufficient to support theteams, and the Presidents, and Captains will examineand know that every soul that goes in said Com-pany is provided with from 3 to 500 lbs of bread stuff, or a year and a halfs, and as much more as he canget for we know not whether we can raise corn thissummer, as we anticipate at the place of location.Let the first Emigration company takewith them as many of the Sisters whose husbandsare in the Army, as can fit themselves out, or can beconveniently fitted out.It is wisdom that all the men in theEmigration Company shall be organized into a mili-tary body, under their respective Captains of 10s, 50s,and 100s with Charles C. Rich as their Commanderin Chief who will see that every man is properlyarmed, and ready to meet any savage encounter ata moment's warning, taking care that caps and primingof all firelocks are so secured as to admit of no acci-dents: that John Scot superintend the artillery un-der C. C. Rich Horace S. Eldredge be marshal Hosea Stout Captain of the Guard on the journeyand that the guard watch during the night, andsleep as they have during the day:The first company will carry theTemple bell, with fixtures for hanging at a moment'snotice, which will be rung at daylight, or a propertime, and call all who are able to arise to prayers,after which ringing of bell and breakfast, or ringingof bell and departure in 15 minutes to secure thecool of the day till breakfast time &c as the bell may 
 be needed, particularly in the night Seasons, if Indiansare hovering round to let them know you are atyour duty, and if any man acts disorderly, punishhim severely.Whenever a Company of 75 men, who donot belong to the present organized Company, shallbe organized so as to carry out the principles of theWord and Will of the Lord and these instructions,according to the Pattern, with or without families,and provisions enough to sustain each soul 18 months,they may come on till the 1st of July, but in allcases, the brethren must run their own risk for foodand not depend on the pioneers, or any Company inadvance for support in the least, either for their teams,themselves, or families, for we are credibly informed thatmore than 30 souls of the Oregon Emigrants, perishedin the Mountains with hunger the last season; and100 bushels of corn can easier bye raised near WinterQuarters, than the 50 bushels at the foot of theMountains.If a man of the 1st Emigration com-pany, who is going to stop at your place for thetime being, should so far forget his Covenant in theTemple, and his more recent obligations and agree-ments as to retain his wagon or team, from the neces-sities of the journey: it will be the duty of the Presi-dents to instruct the captains to take the same andapply it where necessity requires, and thus compel theowner to do what he had previously agreed to, for assome were compelled to come in, in Ancient days, othersmust be compelled to remain in, ^in^ latter days, and menwho are taken at their word have no reason to findfault.

S. Wisconsin, under the Presidency of Jonas Ostlund, with A. F. Anderson, as his first and Michael A. Hansen, as his second counsellor.Andrew J. Aagaard, and Joseph C. Kempe, return-ing missionaries', the first named through ill healthThere are 134 souls in the company, 67 full, and 25 half fares. Included in this number are two sisters, visitors, who have been visiting their friends in Scotland, Sisters Janet Morris, and Dick.They are in excellent health and spirits, and truly faithful Latter-day Saints. Sister Clara Johnson, and her two boys, returning from a visit to friends; and a good sister, Mary AChambers, leaving all her family and going alone to Zion, to spend her days with the Saints of God. All the others are from Scandinavia.They appear to be a very fine class of ourpeople. I met with them on Wednesday eve-ning last, and I enjoyed much freedom in speaking to them. The president, Bro Ostlund,says, he has had no trouble with them at all in 
 nan 
 crossing the sea. They are willing and obedient, full of hope. Our good friend Mr Ramsden gave the Elders two state rooms, worth at this sea-son of the year  45.0.0 a room, had refusedpassengers. The saloon and intermediate was full but our people had the best rooms in the ship. He kindly sent me word ^that^ on wWednesday ^that^our company, pr. S. S. Wisconsin, in charge of Leonard I. Jordan, arrived in New York at 7 a.m. and left at 3 p.m., which intelligence was gratefully received, and we praised God in His holiness. Truly has He blessed us, and holds us in His protect-ing care. We are surrounded with wickedness.The Guion Co. is having a good season, I am happy to say. They bless us and the Lord is blessing them.Every berth in the next two ships are engaged. So you see it does not militate against themcarrying the "Mormon" emigration.

These sailed Sep 6.We had a conference announced for Sunday 7th at London I had promised to attend and had to leave 11.5 on Saturday the 6th a.m. 
 So when the Company was properly organized and all the business attended to; I left with BrotherYoung and family to London and attended Conference and returned to Liverpool in time to attend to this 9th Company. Brother Young re-mained until to-day when he left to attend the Norwich Conference and his family returned to Liverpool. With this company we shall close up our seasons business, so far as I am concerned. We have advertised, to send all, who have not been prepared to go in the September companies, that a company will leave ^here Oct 11th^ from any part of the European Mission and we have already a good many names. But we shall now take stock and turn over the business in a proper manner and send you a balance sheet with the September Report, which will close my labors in the Presidency of the British Mission. We were informed by the Guion Co. who received their report from New York that Bro.

We have taken stock closed up the accounts and have had everything audited and send you the statement thereof for your inspection. There will be bills not paid from  75 to  80 pounds which should be deducted from the Profits and then we have carried some accounts that have been reported year after year as assets to "Doubtful accounts" and charged Profit and loss which will here after put the business in better shape. I cannot but regret that it should have been considered essential to remove me from the Presidency of the European Mission until the seasons business was completed and everything closed up in a business like manner; but I presume my labors are required somewhere else and so hav-ing turned over everything to my fellow laborerApostle B.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42 Islington, Liverpool,June 18th 1890Pres. Wilford WoodruffDear Bro.I trust you willnot consider it presumptous in me to address youon a subject which I believe to be necessary anda duty.During the time I have been laboring here in theLiverpool Office I have observed with anxiety thefailing health of our much beloved President, GeorgeTeasdale, and have carefully and prayerfully arrivedat the conclusion that to withhold the facts in the caselonger from you would be dereliction of duty on mypart as a servant of God.Pres. Teasdale had a very severe attack of sicknessin February and I do not think that he has fullyrecovered from the effects of it, and with the careand responsibility incident to his position as Presidentof the European Mission, his health seems to be graduallybut surely getting worse.Of late his affairs at home seem to give him agood deal of anxiety. He feels the loss of Bro. Pictonvery much, and I understnad that since Bro. Picton'sdeath, Pres. Teasdale's affairs at home are not in asatisfactory condition. The strain upon his mind, underhis present bodily condition, seems to be too great and 
 I fear the consequences should he have to continue agreat while longer without a change or the rest whichhe so much needs. I have not arrived at this conclusionmerely from my own observations, but the same opinionprevails with all the brethren whom I have conversed withon the subject and also Sister Teasdale. Dr. Phillips,who has been prescribing for and attending to Pres. Teasdaleduring his sickness, has kindly, at my request, writtenhis opinion in regard to Pres. Teasdale's condition, andI enclose it with this communication.I have carefully avoided letting Bro. Teasdale know aboutthis letter for fear he might object to it's being sent, andthus withhold the facts in the case from you, that I consideryou should be made acquainted with, preferring, likea true and faithful servant of God, anything ratherthan shrink from his duty.Hoping you will kindly forgive me for addressingyou in this manner, which nothing but a sense ofduty would have prompted me to, and ever prayingfor the blessings of our Heavenly Father to rest uponyou and all the faithful I remainYour humble brother in the cause of ChristWalter Hoge[sideways text] Walter Hoge14 June, 1890Recd July 1 [end of sideways text]

UtahDear Brother:My visits to London andLowestoft and attendance at the Conferences have been pleasantand the Lord is merciful unto us in this Country. At ourLondon Conference it ^is^ said that Jarman mustered his forces justbelow our hall but did not interefere with our comfort.The conference at Lowestoft was unusually well attended Iam informed, and there were about forty people present. One gentle-man who is investigating the principles of the Gospel came to meafter the evening meeting and thanked me for the informationhe had gained. Our affairs are at a low ebb, no persecution, butan indifference, hard to cope with, seems to have settled uponthe people. Lies are flying about and the most insideous comefrom our own mountain home. Apostates write that, the Govt. has stopped polygamy but the elders are living openly with young girlsmarriage or no marriage. I am forcebly impressed with the ideathat if an effort were made among the people, instructions sent to thepresidents of stakes and ^were to^ they operate with the Bishops Teachers etcenergetically, to have the people write to their friends throughout theBritish mission that good would be accomplished. The people are indiffer-ent in this land but they have an excellent example set them by theirfriends in Zion.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42. Islington, Liverpool, 189Don't think me presumptious, brethren, in offering this suggestion, but^I^ have felt, quite strongly that it was the begening of the finish of this mission,of course I am anxious to have it last but I dont ^beleive^ God will endure perfectindifference ^on the part of the people^ for any great length of time. It seems to me there are thous-ands of people here who must receive the Gospel, good honest souls blindedby the craftiness of men, and my mind is already full of anxiety to knowhow to teach them. God help His elders, no human power can breakthe spell which evil has wrought upon the minds of the people.The greater part of the experienced elders of the mission willsoon be released to return home. I feel that we must pray andwork harder more hours to fill the vacancy which will befelt throughout the entire mission.It will be pretty hard upon the president of the mission ^to do^ but itseems actually necessary that he should attend every conference. Somuch needed instructions to the elders. They drop into curious nooksand corners and run in others ruts without giving the subject thought or dueConsederation; and the presthood meetings at these times as the most im-portant of all.My family is well. Mrs. Y. wishes to be kindly remembered to you allGod bless you and give ^you^ every power recquisite to conquor the enemyLove to the brethrenYour Brother in ChristBrigham Young

 Jesse O. Ballenger24 Dec 1877Questions regarding eatingat one TableSunset Arizona Dec. 24th 1877Pres. John Taylorand the Twelve.Dear BreathrenI feel it will not be amiss towrite a few lines to informyou of our present good healthand prospects; Knowing the intresyou have in this mission. We areat our camp at this time abouttwo hundred souls. All enjoyinggood health and a plenty of workWe work all together as one familyand live as near a like as wecan. We are building a diningroom and are calculating toall eat at the same tablelike they do at Orderville. Butthe rumer has come here thatthe Twelve council otherwiseand the brethren do not feelso well united about eatingtogether as they did before and 
 a few words of council fromyou to us on the subject wouldbe thankfuly received no matterwheather it was to all eat at the one table or to continue to eatat our own tables as we areI believe your council would beunanimusly caried out.Bro. Lot Smith has aboutthe same number at hiscamp that we have. They eat at the big table andwork to gether to same as wedo. Bro. Allen has not quiteso many at his camp asis at either of the other campsBro. Lake as joined mycamp. They left their placeon account of sickness. Butare all well at present.We have just started our newthrasher to day and it is doingvery well. Bro. Foster fromOgdenthinks he never saw wheatturn out so well. We haveabout forty acres of fall wheatin at this settlement it looks well. This is I think a veryfine climate, we have hadno snow and but little frostit freezes some of nights Butis nice and warm throughthe days. With kind regardsI wish to remain as everYour Brother in the GospelJesse O Ballenger 
 Nov 1 [18]90B. YoungLiverpoolRcd Nov 20 [18]90In re MissionaryThe First PresidencyDear Brethren:I have sent a copy of this document to the presi-dents of the Conferences, for quite a number of them have told me that there were plenty of ^Young^ men in their neighborhood ^at home^ who were just the men for a mission. Brethren you can see that my intention is good and I hope this will meet your minds. I will forward the list Imake up from the reports, to you soonas possible. True we need men who will strike out into new fields, we ^have^ a very few in the mission who are determined to plow in old fields, and there are no saints to saupport that class. In some conferences I find that retaining drunken people in the church has, in one instance driven out a fairly good man and is baring respectable people who are favorably impressed with ^ the^ doctrines. When all means are exhausted and they persist in their drunkeness I have advised their being cut off. I find respecta-ble people in every Conference who are enquiring into the gospel. Just sunday in stockton on Tees strangers came in the evening ^to our meeting^ and one young man ^was heard to^ remarked ashe went out the door at the close, "I could sit and listen all night to such talk as that," the first principles of the Gospel.Your BrotherB.

 42, Islington, Liverpool, Nov. 1, 1890.Prest. Elder W. WoodruffDear Brother,There is pressing need for Elders in the missionary fields in these lands, and believing that you are acquainted with young men in the wards where you reside, who are financially and otherwise competent to fill good missions, we desire you to send such names to us as you honestly suggest, so that we can present them to the Presidency and Missionary Committee in Zion for their consideration.Trusting that what you do will be quietly and properly done,so as not create feeling when names are not acted upon, and awaiting a prompt reply,I remain your brother in Christ,BRIGHAM YOUNG.

Islington, Liverpool. Oct. 29th 1890.Prest. W. WoodruffSalt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City Utah Dear Brother:Arrived home last night twelve oclock. It is cold and snowy in Scotland. Had an excellent Conference, Hall was crowded most of them strangers. Sub. Ed. "Glasgow Eve-news," present. He walked home with me after evening meeting. I received a note from him Mr. Jas. Alex. Kilpat-rick ^this morning^ apologising for his "anti Mormon humour," "I mean no offense." He proffers to publish any corrections I wish to make in his report of our Conversation.I found the brethren in scotland anxiously looking to L.pool for more elders. The eight ^elders^ that came were not half enough for scotland alone, and I could spare them not one. They want thirty to fifty efficient elders. Openings are being made that must be improved, and we see them languish for the want of help. Most of the Conferences I have attended need assistance, elders who can help themselves and their families not feel distressed. Many of the brethren have said to me, there are plenty of Young ^men at home^ in our neighbourhood, who ought to Come out into the world on missions, and some have stated that, these efficient Young men were kept at home by the ward authorities. I am aware that many 
 remained at home to vote, but the enemy is fast re-leasing them and perhaps we can soon turn all of ^our^ attention to preaching the gospel. I have asked the brethren for lists of names and will send them to you;do not think me too officious in this act, the anxiety in me may plead for me.Good tourists have done a wonderful amount of good, and this class hunt up relatives and introduce the elders into places and families, not reached heretofore.Circumstances make it necessary to release Bro Jenk-ins from the scotish mission. Bro Brough is also released, this leaves but nine elders there. It seems to me that all the elders are going one way. Have some one advise me of elders being called and when they will leave. A few lines will post me.Where it is possible I have not suffered lies in the news papers to go unchalenged. Bro Carlisle and I are now acquainted with parties' connected with the leading papers here and ^also with^ Mr. Shearman American Con-sul and proffered ^to them^ information concerning our affairs that they need go astray no more. I am sending the starto these men and places, and have proffered to give them books if they will read them. Public libraries ought to be supplied, especially reading rooms so far as we can consistently, but I leave this to your direction.We are well and have the old place clean and comparatively cheerful looking. God bless you. Love to Prest Geo Q. C. & Jos. F S. and the brethren, ^In^ w^h^ich all join.Your Brother in Christ Brigham Young 
 P. S. Mr. Gibson informed me that a word from Bro Jack would have secured one free passage accross the ocean, as it was it cost me seventy five dollars. The vessel was not half full and one word would have saved me this expense. I felt a little put out as it took my last dollar, John W. gave me fifty dollars and I got on very well. Prest. Woodruff I would rather give you every dollar I have on earth than to give you just cause to censure my financial business with this office.Oh yes. Mr. Gibson said, we are sorry that Bro^Mr.^ Jack did not speak about your affair, but the board could do nothing only what had been requested but would have granted free passage for yourself and family had it been re-quested ^by^ Mr JackI have had the steps repared and some other need repairs, if the account is not satisfactory I ask Bro Cannon to draw the money from estate and pay it and charge it to me.Yours etc. B.

 42 Islington L.pool Eng.Nov. 8th 1890President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City UtahDear Brother.Your favor of Oct. 20thcame to hand in due course of mail, I am rejoicedto receive this communication from you, it breathesa spirit that finds a congenial echo in my heartand stimulates me to emulate your example in thesegreat and important labors.I was glad to learn that, Bro. Teasdale accom-plished his journey to Deming so comfortably, andof his improved physical condition, as instanced byhis letter to me from that point.  It is I say, very satisfactoryfor he looked badly emaciated and sorrowful when Isaw him last.  It almost gave one the blues to look in-to his sallow countenance, and not until he smiled &talked cheerfully could one eradicate, from his mind,the idea that, he was a much "enduring man."  God gowith him in his new field of labors.  His kind heart andfaithful labors have endeared him to the saints and theyspeak of him here as they spoke of him during my latevisit to Mexico.I am thankful for the prospects of more elderscoming to our assistance.  God give them courage topush out successfully into new fields, for they shall 
 have that blessed opportunity.Bro. Metz is an old friend of mine and I deem hima good man; a little impatient perhaps, sometimes, which wemay, in charity, call firmness and zeal.  I gladly extend thehand of a brother to the elders especially to Bro. Metz andhope to see them all in the near future.It will be a pleasure to release Bro. F. A. Brown to re-turn home and I believe Bro. Metz quite equal to the oc-casion.  Tho^se^ who study the Dutch language find itdifficult to acquire and young men who are appointedto this mission accomplish but little in the field withintwo years.  I have written to Bro. Brown to give mehis views respecting the prospects of the Holland mission,which report I write furni^s^h to you in due time.Prests. Cannon & Smith are perfectly familiar with thedifficulties elders need in the Holland mission,  I am ofthe opinion that we need laborers there now, however Iam willing to let the Lord dictate in this as in all othermatters.I will look anxiously for elders who are suitable togo to Turkey, but I can say to you now that, we needall the help we now have, and if you have in yourmind good efficient men who are natural linguist, 
 I believe they ought to be called and sent to the TurkishmissionWe have been discussing the propriety of putting ourMilleniael star before the public as other papers areadvertized. I can see no impropiity in doing it ifwe incur no additional expense.Bro. Teasdale informs me that you appropriateda sum of money to assist in furnishing tracks to theelders; they are quite liberal with their own means in thisgood work.  You know our condition financially, that is,without your assistance track distributing ^by the elders^ will cease orbe very much curtailed, and I am not clear but what thelatter maybe the proper thing ^for^ theym to do:Within the last month two of our brethern have been banishedfrom the Kingdom of Bavaria.  I am quite sure this would nothave happened if the principles of the gospel had been understood by those in authority, even in Bavaria. Our elders would find a greatadvantage if we were better known, in presenting the gospel ^to strangers^.  We havefriends through whom we might reach some of these parties if we caredto take that trouble.  I would much prefer to be represented by my friendsthen ^by^ my ^by^ enemies.Bro Carlisle and I have made the acquaintence ofmany ofthe newspaper men in this city and we feelsome confidence that they will treat us with some degreeof fairness.  Mr Ranesden has introduced us and hehas made a personal request that we be treated as gentlemen should be. 
 If Prest. Geo. Q. Cannon could make us a visit &introduce some of the elders to parties that he can approach,and I think John W. is favorably known to many in thiscountry, and with all the power we can muster we can reachmen that overtoss those scrubs who maltreat our elders;99 times in a hundred simply because they think our brethrenhave no friends.  I would like to show them to the contrary.The power is in men to do much of themselves and I amsure the Lord has given us a few good friends in this CountryI beleive it to be our duty to use every means in our powerto conteract the abominable lies which ^are^ spued out ofUnited States and find their way onto this island.Our policy is to get acquainted, offer to ans-wer respectable questions and give our reasons for thehope we have.  We have had many interesting conversationswith strangers.  I hear good reports from many partsof the mission.  Where it is practicable we try to crawl out ofthe back alleys and slums ^in our Conferences^ and hire halls in more respecta-ble quarters.  Where it can be done it pays in increase of congrega-tion.Brethren join me in love to you and the brethren asalso my family wish to be kindly remembered to youallYour Brother in ChristBrigham Young

 to avoid complication that it should be donesoon as convenient, I have thought stronglyof having something of the kind here in thiscountry.

 Prd Woodruff expressed himself honor'd in the privilege ofspeaking in this meeting. Referred to the subject of brethrenwanting to be ordained to higher priesthood &c. Agreed withBishop Hunter. Spoke of the early part of the church; for threeyears he acted as Teacher and preached, and built up branches. 
 Wilford Woodruff / said that what he had heard to nightwas good, for we as a people have got to reform, especiallywith regard to our commercial matters, was glad tosee such a willingness manifested towards relievingthe Presidency of some of their burthens; he reminded theBishops, that many were in the habit of taking their Grainto the Gentiles and trade it off he hoped they would put acheck to it as far as they could; he would rejoice to seethe day when all Bishops, Missionaries, Presidents, andothers will be so far living their religion, and walking up totheir duties, that the President could come into their meetings and rejoice in their midst. Spoke of the n^e^cessity ofeach one who holds the priesthood acting in their calling,and not to wait for President Young to put his hand uponeverything that needs correction, he felt to say to Bishop Hunter,his Counsellors, and the Bishops generally May God blessand speed you, he then spoke of the reformation as beinga straightforward and natural thing, there was no mysteryabout it, but consisted in leaving off every evil practise, anddoing better, let us honour every man in his calling, andwherever any man in authority can exercise the spirit ofmercy it is good, though it is neccessary to use the rodat times. May God bless you all Amen.The following "Ordinations" were attended to 
 Wilford Woodruff, desired the Bishops and other authoritiesto lay their hands upon the brain as far as they can, andpay especial regard to the remarks of Elder Orson Hyde,he then appealed to the Missionaries who had partly wakedand desired them to get more of the fire of the Holy Ghost; speakingof the lessor priesthood, he said show me a man who had magnifiedand honored his calling as a Teacher, and I will show you a mightyman in Israel, there had been such a rush into the quorums ofthe Seventy's and High Priests, that they had become as black asmidnight; he rebuked the practise of taking every littledifficulty to the President instead of having them settled by thePriests Teachers &c and he with the rest of the Twelve intendedto be after every Quorum, until the fire of God should burn so hot,as to consume all the iniquity that lurks in our midst. 
 Wilford Woodruff was pleased with L. W. Hardy's introducing theBook of Mormon &c into the schools, spoke of his own indefaticable exertions about a year ago, to wake up an interest among thechildren in every ward by holding evening meetings with thembut owing to the deadness of the parents it was an uphill workand almost labour in vain, speaking of the priesthood he saidBp Hunter was the head of this Bishopric, and he often feltweighed down with something on his mind which he wantedthe Bishops to relieve him of, by carrying out his instructions, refered to the Israelites who had gone so far from God, that they could donothing without a Law, even to govern them in the smallest things,such was the condition of the world at the present time, spoke ofthe extent of the priesthood that the Bishops exercised amongthe people, which was sufficient for almost everything that trans-pired, if the people will do right.He deprecated the practise of farmers bringing young sheep to theButchers for slaughter, and desired the Bishops to check it, forthe raising of Wool, Hemp, and Flax was of too much importanceto be trifled with, for we may rest assured, that we shall be underthe necessity of sustaining ourselves, and that very soon.contrasted the law of the priesthood with the laws of the Territory, byone of which everybody had to be governed. 
 Wilford Woodruff, suggested as a preventive against thebrethren getting behind hand in their tithing, viz for everyone to pay it at the very time of raising, and in every kindthat is raised, he also suggested that Bro McRae be appointeda Bishop of the 11th Ward, with the view of relieving the excess-ive burthen now upon the shoulders of Bro Hardy. 
 Wilford Woodruff backed up the sentiments just advanced, he feltthat it was the duty of the Bishops to attend to their temporal duties,which was the leading ideas of Bp Hunter, the responsibilitiesresting of the Bishops are great, especially as so many of thebrethren are now taking more wives, they will require at yourhands much council on the principle of obedience, for unlesschildren are taught to be obedient to their parents, they will become poor Husbands and wives. It was the duty of theTwelve that are at home to follow the example of Prest B Youngto walk into the different quorums to give instruction, and seehow things are going on, for it was not only their right, but Godrequired it at their hands; he wished the Bishops would holdon to the members of the quorums of Priests, Teachers and Deaconsthat are good for anything, and not allow them to go off intothe seventys until they have magnified their calling in the lessorpriesthood, but he deprecated a contentious spirit betweenthe different quorums, as to which was the greatest, this had beena bone of contention since the beginning, and ought to be put astop to, after giving some valuable instruction on this subject, heprayed that God would bless us all. 
 Wilford Woodruff, stated there was a vacancy in the history of thechurch, for at least 3 months immediately after the death of Joseph,and if any present can furnish anything either from memory or Journalthat transpired during that period, will please forward the same to theHistorians Office, referring to the reformation, he said the Lord had forgivenus for what was past, but after rebaptism, should the people again sin inIsrael, the Law would undoubtedly be put in force, for it was impossiblethat people could henceforth sin with impunity, for he well knew that PrestYoung would never appear before us again in that merciful consideration,which he has done of late, refered to the great blessings that belonged tothe lessor priesthood, especially the ministration of angels, and stronglydeprecated a spirit of contention that had been more or less manifestfor the last 14 years, and recommended each one to realize the responsibility that rested on them, let their calling be what it may, mentionedthe power of the priesthood that was manifest in several instancesin Nauvou, where the sick and dying lay about in all directions, andJoseph rose up and shook himself, and commanded every one of themto rise up, and they were healed forthwith, he also spoke of other instanceswhere the wicked were Kept at Bay, and were made to Quake and fearat the words of the Lord through his Servants Joseph, Brigham, and DavidPatten, spoke of the clouds that were gathering ahead of us, and the necessityof each one being in readiness both Temporally and Spiritually, that we mayhave the blessing and approbation of God. 
 W. Woodruff, felt interested, he had seen a reformation in everymeeting he now attended, there was a different spirit andatmosphere altogether, to what there was last year, spoke ofthe principle of submission to the priesthood, that existed herein this King dom, which could not be found among anypeople on the face of the earth, he refered to the example thatthe Saviour set us in this thing, by patiently enduring the mostabject poverty and deprivation of every kind, surrounded by bitterpersecution &c all in obedience to the priesthood, there was not oneout of a thousand in this Territory that would refuse to obey thecouncil of President Young, and while we as a people continueto take this course, we shall be surrounded with blessing allthe time, the world knows nothing of this principle, but ratherindulge in a disposition to devour each other, he then spoke ofthe importance of the twelve having the same spirit as was in PresidentYoung, and as He could not be personally present in the variousquorums, wherever the twelve went, they should be able to do justas He would, were he present, after giving much instruction andencouragement, he prayed that God would bless them.D. Fulmer, was delighted to contemplate the change that had beenbrought about among the saints, especially in the absence of alldifficulties, for he had not heard of one either with the Bishopsor any one else for a long time, whereas some time ago, notonly the Bishops, but the High Council and the Presidency hadpiles of them. 
 Wilford Woodruff, believed the saints would have just as much to doin this world, and in that which is to come, as ever we are capableof performing, and so far from supposing we had come here to rest,his past experience had thoroughly converted him from that doctrine,he spoke of the importance of every Elder in Israel keeping a Journalor History of things as the transpire, at the first organization of theTwelve apostles,  The Prophet Joseph said he had suffered much sorrowof heart, for not writing or caused to be written the dealings of God withthis people, he said also, whenever you Quorums meet, be sure you alwayshave a clerk to record all your decisions, if you don t, the Lord will be angrywith you  Bro. Woodruff remarked that he had himself kept a Journalfor the last 24 years, and daily recorded his doings and whereabouts,and much of what he had heard from the Prophet Joseph and theTwelve, he then strongly urged on the Bishops to keep an account ofhow they spend their time, which would form an important History inGenerations to come &c 
 Bro W. Woodruff, hoped the people wouldtake care of what sheep we now have, there had beensuch neglect heretofore, and consequently great loss anddestruction which had made his heart sick he hoped theBrethren would take more care of them, on Tithing hesaid he had been in the Storehouse and seen the immen[se]quantity of Grain, and if a few more Teams came in [,] thebins would run over. 
 Elder Woodruff spoke of the importance ofBishops watching especially at the present time as therewere many gathering between the Mountains to go East.there had been a span of Horses taken away last nightat the West Mountain, the Lariats had been cut and theAnimals were missing, he exhorted the Bishops to watchand for them to set others to watch also, and as far as possible dont allow any one to go away in debt either tothe Emigrating Fund or any one else for it was nothingbut right that people should pay their debts before theyare allowed to go away. 
 Elder Wilford sustained the remarks and sentiments of Prest Young, and was glad that the time hadcome, when the Elders on missions would be sustained with funds by the people here instead of the poor saints abroad.
