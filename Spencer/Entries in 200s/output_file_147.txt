Thrones are cast down, all governments of the Earth are tottering from their foundations Anarchy and confuscion are begining to reign, Hatred strife and war are begining to be poured out upon the children of men. In the midst of this order of things, the Latter  Day Saints discover vast quantities of Gold at the base of the mountains of Israel in the valley of the sacramento in upper Calafornia. And not ownly the people of the United States but of other nations ketch the sound of Gold Gold and tens of thousands are rushing forward evry way in their power to get to the gold country as a horse would rush to battle, but the amount of Gold, silver, coper andc discoverd in that Country indicates that the worldd of the Lord spoke by Isaiah will be fulfilled, when He says that "for Brass He will bring Gold, for Iron I will bring silver, for wood brass for stones Iron," andc truly this is an age big with Events Companies are forming in all most all parts of the United States and ships in all our ports prepareing to take the  people to the Bay of San Francisco which is ownly 20 miles from Capt Sutters Fort whare the Mormon gold digings commenced and It seems as though all the world thought of at the present time was to obtain gold.

All the Nations of the Earth at the present time both Jew and Gentile Are presenting to the eye of men scenes that were unlooked ^for^ by the ignorant or learned, the Philosopher, Asstronomer Poet, Divine, Editor, Dr, Lawyier Statesman, President, Ruler King Prince or Pope, which events are ownly understood by the man  of God inspired by the power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost such an one can perfectly understand the present signs of  the times. He can see the fulfillment of the words of the Lord begining to present themselves according to the prediction of all the Holy Prophets since the world began, such are the ownly class who have faith in the litteral fulfillmen of all the Reve- lations of Jesus Christ in the last days. They are the ownly ones who understand their fulfillment as the events are passing before them, or that have cause to rejoice therein, to all others the Sequel of the present signs of the Times are hid behind the veil of doubts Darkness and uncertainty    ENDENTRY December 29, 1848 ~ Friday to  ENDENTRY December 30, 1848 ~ Saturday   29th and 30th We had a heavy snow storm I spent the time reading and writing I perused the New York Herald to Dec 30 which contained inte- resting items spoken of in following pages    ENDENTRY December 31, 1848 ~ Sunday   31s Sunday the last day of the year of AD 1848 A synopsis of my Journal will be found on a following Page   ENDENTRY THUS ends the Year of eighteen hundred and forty eight  A Year big with events, a year in which the fig tree  hath rapidly put forth her leaves and blossomed for the summer A year which has lade the foundation for the fulfillment of  more Prophesy and Revelation than has been fulfilled in whole  centuries in other ages. Thrones have been cast down, whole  Kingdoms have been overturned, the power of the Pope of Rome  laid prostrate and he driven from his Kingdom. All the nations of  the Earth convulsed Revolutions, wars anarchy and confusion follow  each other in rapid succession, Cholera, plagues, and famine follow  in the train. And last of all though not least in importance  is the foundation laid for the disolution of the American  Government while these things are going on the Jews are gather- ing home to rebuild Jerrusalem, some 7000 Latter Day Saints  have gatherd into the valley of the mountains of Israel by the  valley of the Sacramento  have discoverd vast quantites of Gold, silver, coper Iron and other  mettels the report of which has spread like electricity through  through the world which is causing tens of thousands of the  world to flock to that place these are some of the features  of the signs of 1848  The revolutions of France. The people  rose in mass had 3 days fight, at the end of which they drove Louis  Philipi King of the French out of France with all the Royal family  the People entered the Turrelles took the Throne upon their  shoulders carried it into the streets and dashed it to peaces upon the  ground. The people then undertook to esstablish a republican  government, it was said to be ownly 500 killed in the first 3 days  fight Afterwords a reaction took place with a fight and some  15000 killed, they have finally organized, and the world are now looking  Daily for the account of their electing a President and it is expected  by many that much blood will be shed on the occasion in consequence  of the many conflicting Parties. The Prusia next  follow in Revolution which is still unsetled. Next the People of  Austria arose and Drove the King from his Throne and Kingdom He  afterwards returned with Armies and bombarded Vienna 8 days  and regained his Kingdom but has been driven to the necessity of  giving his people a milder form of government and more toleration  still his Throne is in danger. The Emperor of Rusia has had  much war and his Throne is in danger. The Irish have  made a Struggle to throw off the Brittish yoak and they have failed  yet deep trouble is brewing for that nation. The inhabitants  of Rome have risen up in their strength and compelled the  pope to make change after change, and at last have dashed his  power to the Earth assassinated his Councellors and Driven him  from his Papal seat which has never before been shaken for  the last fourteen hundreds years and he has had to seek prot- ection by fleeing to other Nations. While this is going on in for- eign Countries let us turn our eyes for a moment to the Position of Blood Stained America. A Nation though blessed above all  other Nations under Heaven yet she has of late been guilty of sheding  the Blood of Apostles Prophets Patriarchs and Saints she has suffered  mob rule to take the place of Constitution law and order and what  position is she in at the Close of this year, not ownly one of her states Ohio has disgraced herself by having a legislaton sit for   ENDENTRY weeks and spend their time in fighting for the mastery instead of  organizing and doing the business of the people, but the leaders of the  whole Nation itself at Washington are engendering the spirit of party  strife, hatred disunion and war meeting in seperate parties and  laying plans for the dissolving of the Union and the anhilation  of the American Government. And James Gordon Bennett of  the New York Herald and other Editors after Prophesying month after  month that their was no danger of disolving our union are with  all their prophesies recorded in their paper stareing them in the  face, under the necessity of recording the account of the parties  ways and means made use of to accomplis and bring to pass the vary things they have been prophesying against. And while the Senators  and Statesman of the Slave states meet in convention and resolve that  if slavery in the Distrect of Columbia is abolished or prohibited  from Calafornia that they will immediately dissolve  the Union, lay taxes upon the shiping of the free States andc At the  same time Citizens and Statesmen of the free states meet in conven- tion and Resolve if these things are not done they in like manner  will dissolve the Union. While these parties are growing more and  more determined, and further and wider apart. Still the public mind  seems to be blinded as to the result of these resolutions, and are  ignorant concerning the fruit which will be produced by the seed of there own sowing yes they have "eyes but see not, ears but hear not and  hearts but do not understand" while the servent of God wfilled with inspiration, can behold the scene in its true light and knows well  the result, with as much certainty as Lot, and Jesus,  did each in their day while gazing upon the conduct of the Anted- eluvians, Sodom and Gomorrow, or the inhabitants of Jerrusalem and  as the words of the Lord were fulfilled in the former case in like  manner will they in the latter. ##Matthew 13:15## During the past year the Asiactic  cholera one of the plagues of the last days has also again commenced  its march through the Earth slaying its tens of thousands. it has now  made its appearance in Scotland and has just arived  in the United States is in Memphis  and Cincinnati the last report states about 100 daily in New Orleans  the signs of the gathering of the Jews has been vary prominant during  the past year, the governments of the world have in some measure been  exherted to favor that people. And while I turn my eye towards Zion I can see the Lord is favoring her. The Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter Day Saints has been organized with a first Presidency  of three viz Willard Richards,  who have gatherd to the mountains of Israel in the valley of the  Great Salt Lake took with them about 3000 souls and some 8000  head of cattle of all kinds which now makes a population of about  7000 saints in the Great Bason North  America. The Saints who were located near the Bay of San  Francisco have found a vast amount of welth in mines, such  as Dimonds, Gold, Silver, quick silver, platina, copper, lead, tin, zink  Iron andc, these things have been found to such an extent that it is  creating great excitement throughout the world esspecially in  the United States and tens of thousands are flocking to that land. Crime of Evry kinsd has apparently increased 100 per ct throughout the  United States and the cup of their iniquity is full and the hour of  their Judgment is come Calamity sorrow and Death has recieved its comm- ission to visit this land.

We read the long Law upon the direct tax and discussed that subject President Young said in speaking of Govornor Dawson you  take a man like him who has been an Editor for 15 years and  you will find him to be a Jackass. He told the story of Brockass On the steamer going down the river. The Homestead Bill was spoken of. President Young said the Lord will soon pass a Homestead Bill. you need not look for the Nation to do much for us. H Stout was of the opinion that the Legislature had not  the power to make laws disposing of Lands and improvements Orson Hyde made short speeches. President Young followed and said you want to go to and call a convention we want to get up a state government. I believe as I live that that we should organize a State Government and let it go into Effect by the 15th March and I have faith to believe that God will sustain us.

I want to say one word with regard to assuming this diret tax I think we had better let the Government appoint there own officers and collect there own tax, for I am satisfied that a Legal and Lawful assesor  and collecter cannot be found in this Territory according to this law for there is not a Free holder in this Territory    ENDENTRY December 24, 1861 ~ Tuesday   24 I spent a part of the day in the Legislature the Afternoon I met FIGURE in the New Hall in the 14 ward at 10 oclok for the purpose of dedica- ting the House. Mrs Woodruff with several others of the sisters have been at work night and day almost for several days in making the curtains and trimings for the windows and doors in order to get it ready for the Dedication. Brother Edington took the supervis- ion of the whole triming of the House. President Young arived at about 11 oclok He called upon me to offer the Dedication  Prayer   The following Dedication Prayer was offered by W Woodruff   O God our Eternal Father we present ourselves before thee this Morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to Dedicate this House unto Thee, and we ask for thy Holy Spirit to bring all things to our rememberance which may be nessacessary in the dedication of this House. We dedicate the Foundation of this building together  with the ground upon which it stands that it may be Holy from  the commencement to the name of Most High. We dedicate the Foundation with the rock Mortar and timbers and all things appertaining thereto that it may be Holy unto the Lord. We dedicate the walls of this House with the adobies, the mortar and every tihing appertaining thereto that it may be Holy unto Thee. We dedicate the door with the Joists boards and nails thereof that the same may be Holy unto Thee. We also dedicate the windows with the sash, glass putty and every thing pertaining thereto  also the curtains with the trimings ^thereof^ and the shades that they may be Holy unto thee Lord. we dedicate the doors with the Hinges screws locks, latches, and every thing pertaining thereto that they may be Holy unto Thee the Lord our God. We dedicate the Roof with the rafters, boards, shingles, lath, nails   ENDENTRY Dec 24 1861 Plastering, cornice, ornamental work and all things  appertaining thereto that Evry thing may be Holy and consec- rated unto Thee. We dedicate the stand the pulpit the seats the floor the Boards the paint and evry thing belonging thereto also the Benches and seats in this room that they may be Holy unto the Lord. And we pray that this dedication, may  be acceptable, that this house and the ground whare on it stands may be Holy unto Thee, and we ask that thy Blessings may rest  upon the Bishops and Priests and Elders who may occupy this  stand that they may be inspired to speak unto the Edifycation of this people and that they may magnify the Holy Priesthood given unto them. And we pray that this House may be clean and every thing clean and pure which dwells therein O God the Eternal Father we dedicate this House unto thee and thy Kingdom for the purpose of Preaching, teaching,  instruction, singing and prayer, and for the teaching of Our  Children, and for Lawful and innocent recreation. we pray that thy protecting care may be over this House, that it may be  protected from fire and winds, and Every Evil Element And O God we pray that the spirit and power of darkness may have no dominion here, That thy saints may inherit  this place in peace, that no Enemy may have power in  this House. And should the day Ever come that the Enemies of thy Saints should have dominion in this Land grant that this Building may be destroyed from the foundation and not one stone left upon another that the wicked and unholy may  never inherit this House, nor this City nor any of the Houses of thy Saints which have been dedicated unto thee Grant to accept of this dedication we beseech of Thee that thy spirit may  rule and reign in this House, and may thy saints not worship this House nor any thing appertaining to this Earth, But may they worship the Lord of Hosts and help do thy will and Esstablish thy kingdom upon the Earth. And if anything there be pertaining to this Building or the ground upon which it stands that we have not named before thee Grant that it may be Holy, that all things pertaining thereto with the dedication thereof may be acceptable unto Thee  which we ask in the name of Jesus Christ our Redeemer Amen   ENDENTRY Dec 24 1861 At the close of the Dedication Prayer President Young addressed  the saints the following are some of the remarks which he made FIGURE He said as I have the privilege of speaking I hope I many be  actuated by the spirit of intelligence. As Brother Woodruff has asked the Lord in his prayer so I feel to say amen to the whole  of it even to the destruction of the Buildings if our Enemies ever had power to possess it. But I do mot think ewe shall  ever be driven from this inheritance I am satisfied we never shall be if we live our religion and do our duty. Here we are gathered together from all the Nations of the Earth, like the net  cast into the sea it gathers both good and bad and each one works  out what is in him. While Brother Woodruff was offering the  dedication Prayer I was wondering if they dedicated there  School Houses anciently. They dedicated Solomons Temple but  I dont know as they did there School Houses But we should dedicate ourselves and all we have unto the Lord. We still have some  among us who still wish to mingle with the wicked they still want to introdue Mr Devil to me and to this people and such wood  hender the progress of the kingdom of God. I am pleased to meet with you here to day. I see the taste which you have displayed in the finishing of this house which I like and admire. Pardon me for quoting a remark of a man from the north in seeding the 13 ward Assembly rooms proped up to keep them from falling down. He said the glory of the Bishop of the 13 ward  had departed. But I hope the glory of the Bishop of the  14 ward will not depart as did the 13 ward I hope this  House will not fall down. I am pleased to see that you have brought together the Elements which surround you and Erected  a Beautiful Hall which is a pleasure to meet in. Even the  most wicked take pleasure in beholding that which is beautiful  and lovely. I delight to meet here my soul is full of Blessings  for this people. we are living in a world of sin yet we are approaching to the light and travelling together as Latter  Day Saints we should dedicate our all to God. The gospel of  Jesus Christ is to make good men better and to put them  in a position to receive Joy and glory to the fullness   ENDENTRY Dec 24th 1861 of the capacity of man. Many Elders pray that they may  may have confidence in God. But I pray that I may live so that God may have confidence in me I think it folly to pray that I may have confidence in God for He is right all the  time and if we will live so that he may have confidence  in us we will do well. It is our duty to make all the  improvement we can while we live. All that we see here  on the Earth is a similitude of what is in heaven. we have the Elements all around us to beautify and adorn zion  but we should not set our hearts upon Gold or silver or  any thing upon Earth But sanctify the Lord in our Hearts  then we shall partake of Eternal life. I say to the 14 ward  if you occupy this House in the fear of God it will prove a  Missouri  we had to walk up and sign a Deed of trust to pay the Expenses of the mob in driving out the saints they said  Jo Smith could not make the saints consecrate but we can  make them consecrate. The saints here complained of paying a little tax and a little tithing money I dont know  but the Lord will let us pay a little money tax to the Devil the  Government requires a direct tax of some $27,000 dollars  When you have parties in this House dont admit drunken  men into it. another principle I wish to speak of if the  Bishop wishes to invite a Gentile in dont let the people complain about it for when a Gentile comes in here and the priesthood  rules the Gentiles can do no hurt, But Let an Elder or any latter Day Saints go and attend a party among the Gentiles  whare they reign and it is vary different that would be  rong. we should never bow down to the wicked we should never  descend but asscend and try to Elevate others to our standard    Men come here from the States and profess to be asstonished at  our History and improvements, and they come here Expecting to accomplish that which they will not do. Most of the officers  which the Government have sent here are a Hiss and a By word  and a stink in the nostralls of all good men and there never was a wickeder man than the President of the United States   ENDENTRY Dec 24 1861 and so are his associates vary wicked men. I hop we will  strive to magnify our lives which God has given us, for we shall either go on to life Everlasting, or descend to Everlasting  destruction. if we were all pure in heart as we should  be we would have pureower to hold our children and not bury  them as we now do. Now go to and dedicate your hearts and  your houses and all you have unto God. I feel to bless you  in the name of the Lord. we are in a world of sin, darkness  and temptation, and any man who will not be faithful to this life how can He Expect to obtain Eternal Life. We have got the Earth and what  we cannot Buind to the kingdom of God we will let go.    President O Hyde they both made many good remarks.

This year has brought to pass much of the  fulfillment of the predictions of the Ancient and Modern Prophets of God. See this Journal DecJan 31st 1861 I there  declaired as a Prophetic Historian that this year would  be the most distressing year America Ever sayw since they were an independant Nation time has proven it so   Five States viz Florida seceded from from the Union in January the first month of the year North Carolina, Virginia, and A part of Missouri have all seceded during 1861. This has brought on a terrible war upon the Nation both North and South have rushed to armes Untill the North alone has over six hundred thousand men under arms and the South near the same number of men. this war has cost the Northern States some Five Hundred Millions of Dollars during the past year and many thousands of lives and this is ownly the Begining of trouble the close of 1862 will leave America with a debt upon her shoulders of One Billion dollars a debt as large as the debt of England. The state of Missouri whare the saints have received there persecutions is now the great Battlefield of the west. it is now man against man and neighbor against Neighbor they who have spoiled the saints are now being spoiled Independance, and Jackson County Missouri, is nearly destroyed is is the case with many parts of the State. The Lord has taken peace from the Earth and all Nations are still prepar- ing for war. The Lord has pointed out the fate of this Nation in the Book of Mormon and Doctrins and Covenants He has said that when they became ripened in iniquity they should be cut off, that day has come there cup of iniquity is full, the whole Nation Rulers and people are filled with corruption befor God And the presi- dent and Senate of the United States are sending men to Utah to rule over this people as a Govornor and Judges   ENDENTRY 1861 who are so corrupt that they are a Hiss and bye word and  a stink in the Norstrills of all people in the streets.

They have forfeited all right and title to Redemption or Hand of the Lord or his Saints it is decreed that the measure which they have meeted out unto the saints shall be meetied unto them and  they are hastening unto there work of desolation, war, Bloodshed,  and destruction and wo, wo, is ther doom. The spirit of Prophecy would cry O, Lord, Hasten thy work, let the wicked slay the wicked untill the whole land is clensed from the corruption, sin,  abominations, and wickedness which now reigns upon the face of the whole Earth. May thy Judgments continue to be poured out upon this land of North America untill the Blood of Prophets  and Saints is avenged before the Lord and thy words fulfilled  upon the Land of Joseph. Take away the sceptre rule and Government from the wicked and corrupt and give it into the  Hands of the Just even thy saints, that they may rule in righteousness before thee. Give thy oppressed people O Lord the privilege of appointing there own Governor, Judges, and Rulers, from this time forth that thy Kingdom may be Esstab- lished upon the Earth, and the poor rejoice in the Holy One of Israel   ENDENTRY A Synopsis of my Labors in 1861.
