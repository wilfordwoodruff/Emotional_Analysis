But I will  now inform them &amp; all people that if they make war upon me I shall not attempt to restrain them any more but I shall let  them do as they please. The United states do not know what  they are doing. &amp; the Merchants in this place do not know who they are they are selling the blood of this people for Gold. they were not going to bring any goods to this place but now that an army of 2500 men are coming here to destroy this people  they can bring a great amount of Goods let them take Heed to their ways.

The Nation is determined to make us free  they are determined to drive us to defend our selves &amp; become  independant. The Nation is breaking to peases in spirit their  is no Union among them &amp; before the United States get through  trying to destroy us they will want to let out the Job I told  the people years ago that if they would let us alone we would Convert  &amp; revolutionize the world if they did not let us alone but undertake  take to break us up we should spread abroad the faster &amp; do the  work so much the sooner &amp; we will do it if this nation now  makes war upon us we will be free &amp; build up the kingdom  of God the sooner.

I feel well &amp; I will tell you why if I am right  and I know I am and that is this people are now much  nearer their Fathers face than they ever were before they  are united and willing to do the will of God and this causes  me to rejoice. The people now fell to say it is the kingdom  of God or nothing it is not my farm or my house but the  kingdom of God this is the case with this people.

President Young sta compiling his History. He remarked that the revelation upon  a plurality of wives was given to Joseph Smith in 1831 He revealed  it to Oliver Cowdery alone upon the solem pledge that He would not  reveal it or act upon it it but He did act upon it in a secret manner  &amp; that was the cause of his overthrow. President Young also said  that the United States are driving this people to war sooner than is for their good for we are civilizing the Indians &amp; if they would  give us time we would give them a knowledge so that when they  do fight the Gentiles that they would have some Judgment &amp; not  kill women &amp; Children &amp; those who ought  now many of the emigration on the way to Carson valley the Gentile  emigrants shoot the indians wharever they meet with them &amp; the  Indians now retaliate &amp; will kill innocent People.

The Gentiles are vary  wicked &amp; the cup of the United States as a Nation is full &amp; they  are enemies to God &amp; his kingdom &amp; people they are determined  in their hearts that God &amp; his Christ shall have no kingdom on  the Earth &amp; they are now about to make war upon his saints  the time is at the door that will try mens souls the Lord has   ENDENTRY  promised to fight the battles of his saints nevertheless the saints  will be tried whether they will abide in his covenant even  unto death whether we are willing to lay down our lives for  Christ sake, word has been sent out to call in the Elders from  abroad from among the Gentiles, &amp; the gospel has begun to go to  the Lamanites &amp; the Lord is about to remember his covenant  with that people, the Judgments of our God must now soon be  poured out upon the Gentile world &amp; the children of Jacob &amp;  the House of Israel must go forth &amp; fulfill their destiny &amp; help  build up Zion all nations are becomeing vary wicked may  the Lord give us grace according to our day &amp; help us to stand  the test &amp; prove in the hour of trial &amp; temptation t Brethren, &amp; our covenants.

It appears as though  the whole world was about to make war upon the kingdom  of God. In years that are past &amp; gone we have had towns  cities, counties &amp; states with the Govornor &amp; people against  us. Now the whole Nation has risen up against us, vary  well, let lightnings flash &amp; thunders roll &amp; Earth quake bellow  and let all hells dark Hosts gather in battle array against  God and his Christ against the Church &amp; kingdom of our God against  Daniel &amp; the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb  of God &amp; all ther followers Let the Heathen rage &amp; the people  imagin vain things let them take council to destroy the  Lords Anointed.

G A. Smith said that the ownly thing for the President of the United States to get out of his trouble ownly to  get a Bill through Congress to admit any territory as soon  as they had population Enough to organize a State Government  &amp; to be received at once into the Government or Union with  equal privileges with the other States. President Young then said let me suggest a matter Brother salmon River now do we not want a station about half way from here say near fort Hall should we not send men say 20 to  make a station there it was thought best to do so. He said that the north is the place for us &amp; not the south no one but the  saints would want the cold North country. This is the FIGURE of this Continent &amp; I think we had better keep near the lock  &amp; kepp the FIGURE in our own hand. If we send a company we  want to send them this fall so that we can put in grain  there this season    Marsh spent the fore noon with us helping about his history I spent most of the day     ENDENTRY September 7, 1857    &amp; spent the remainder of the day in the office    ENDENTRY September 8, 1857    day in the Van  in this Young in the evening    ENDENTRY September 9, 1857    social Hall at 9 oclok with the presidency &amp; Twelve &amp; some 100 citizens He presented Gov Young with a letter of Instructions or request which was read  before the assembly &amp; but little said &amp; a great deal thought.

President Young asked  if there was any one present who could supply capt Van vle Snider arose &amp; said that that He could supply 40000 feet  of Lumber. No other one said any thing President Young  afternoon President Young walked with Captain Van Vliet through his Garden &amp; orchard &amp; through Professor Carringt- ons the Capt Asked Mrs Carrington if she was willing to  cut down her fine peach orchard for her faith &amp; Religin she said "yes and would set up nights to do it if it became necessary   ENDENTRY September 10, 1857    him to work ploughing my field for wheat.

ENDENTRY September 12, 1857    was some 900 troops on the way this side of Laramie &amp; some 12 government Baggage trains. Capt Van Vl came into the Young had a good deal  of conversation with him. He said to him I do not  want to fight the United States but if they drive us to it we shall do the best we can &amp; I will tell you as God lives that we shall come off conquerer for  we trust in God. For God has set up his kingdom on the Earth &amp; it will never fall but it will stand we shall do all we can not to fight but if they drive  us to it God will overthrow them. if they would let  us alone &amp; say to the mobs now you may go &amp; kill the  Mormons if you can but we will have nothing to do with it  this is all we would ask of them But for the Government  of the United States to array their armies against us  it is to despicable &amp; damnable for any honorable Nation &amp; God will have them in derission for doing it. The Govern- ment has all the time endeavoured to destroy us in an under- handed manner. But Now if they come against us  we will whip them all the time and you will see  that we will do it. The United States are sending their armies to hold us still untill a Mob can come and  kill us and they have done this all time. we are the supporters of the United States Constitution, &amp; we love  the Constitution &amp; Laws of the United States. But it is the corrupt Administration of those Laws which we are suffering under &amp; not the Laws. if the Laws had  been carried out in Missouri it would have hung Gov  Boggs Between the heavens &amp; the Earth and all his friends who was in the murdering &amp; expelling the Saints from  the states they shot down the mormons whenever they  could. They killed Hiram. Then when Col  Nauvoo with his armey He did not inq- uire who killed Joseph Smith or Hiram or any of the saints who had been killed but enquired for some missing  Man that we knew Nothing about &amp; said he should Hold  me responsible for the life of that man. This has been the  course with the Government all the time. We got up a  Memorial or  States last winter the Declaration was then read to  Capt Van Vle find any fault with it ownly it is couched in vary  strong language. President Young said that is what I  intended. And I will now ask capt Van Vleit if   ENDENTRY   the of the government officers which have been sent here  who have any interest with us But they have tried to destroy us. Capt van vleit said this is the case with most men in the Territories they received their offices as a steping stone to the senatorship, but they have no interest for the people. This people have been lied about the worst of any people I ever saw the greatest hold the world  have now upon you is they accuse you of Burning 900 vol  of the United States Statutes. Thomas Williams who was one  of the owners of the Books which were burned denies their  being any Books of the United States being burned. I have  told the people all the time all I asked of them was to tell  the truth about us to pay their debts &amp; steal Nothing they are welcome to go their way. Now if this government has arived at that state that they will tri to kill  the people for their religion No honorable man  should be afraid of them. President Young then told  the story about the Quaker that a Yankey went to whip the Quaker said that he was not the man that he wanted He had not done any thing wrong but the man said He would  whip him any how so the Quaker laid down his hat &amp; coat  &amp; said lie there religion untill I whip this man &amp; he did whip him tremendiously. It will be so with the United States  if they insist in whiping us they will get awfully whiped Capt Van Vleit we have treated all men as well as we  have you who have been sent here as officers of the US  government. we wish still to treat them well and we  would like to ward off this Blow if we could But  the United States are determined to drive us to fight we cannot do any thing but what the government will take  exception to it. They will kill us if they can I have prof  of this. They killed Hiram in Jail not with stand- ing the faith of the Govornor the Armey &amp; the states was  pleged to protect them, &amp; when they had killed them they then got a writ for me I carried a large Bowie  knife with me and I said that any man that laid hands upon my sholder and said Mr Young you are my prisioner  I would send that man to hell across lots &amp; I have said  that all the time since and I say it now I have broaken  no officers to be killed as they have killed Joseph. They did  once take a Bogus Brigham which was Brother Miller  &amp; took him to Carthage &amp; did not find out his mistake  untill they got him there. Capt Van vleit said that I do not think that it is the intention of the Government to take you but to instill a New Governor in this Territory President Young said I Believe that you tell the truth that  you believe this but you do not know their intentions as well as I do. when you get away from here you will think  of a great many things which you have seen and heard The people have all the time accused us of Colleagueing with the Indians against the Government &amp; they were much afraid   ENDENTRY  watched to keep him away from them but now they  have driven us into their midst and now I want you to  watch the signs of the times &amp; you will see that God will  work against that Nations who are trying to destroy both  the Indians &amp; Mormons the Government has become corrupt  &amp; they are the ones who are breaking the Constitution of the United  Mormons who are the Elders of Israel    ENDENTRY September 13, 1857    into my field 4 miles &amp; back I then went to the House of  Sister Smoot as she  was sick we then went to Meeting in the Tabernacle &amp;  John Taylor Preached a splendid discourse upon the first  Principles of the gospel.

But He did preach in the power of God  &amp; told the people his Feelings. Capt Van Vleit set by  &amp; when President Young spoke of the wickedness &amp; cor- ruption of the government it made him feel at  the close of the meeting we met with the missionaries  who were appointed to lecture upon the subject of Home  Manufacturing we then went into council with the  presidency to select a company of missionaries to go  &amp; make a settlement on Black foot fork 63 volunteered  &amp; 42 of them were chosen at the close of this council I went direct to the Meeting at the Tabernacle Charles R Daina spoke first He had Just returned from England when  he went on his mission the Twelve Blessed him I was  mouth He said evry word which I proclaimed upon his  head was fulfilled to the vary letter.

B. H  Stenhouse I then went to Capt Hoopers &amp; met  with Capt Van Vleit a short time after President  Brigham Young A. Carrington  J Taylor &amp; a number of others. Capt Van Vleit  was preparing to leave at 3 oclok in the morning President  Young was now to have his last interview with him  &amp; he wished to talk to him in a plain manner He said   ENDENTRY  as things were here He said I have seen the suffering  of this people through the Persecutions of the people of  the United States for the last 25 years and I will not  bear it any longer. we have always treated the United  States officers well but they have constantly lied abo- ut us &amp; tried to destroy us all the time. we would still  have received their govornors &amp; officers if they had  sent them here without an Army but inasmuch as  they are now disposed to send an Armey here to  hold us still while others run their read hot Iron  into us &amp; then kill us we will now say that we will  not have neither their soldiers Armies or officers  any more here at all, and you may tel them so we will  Just fight for our liberty &amp; rights from this day forth whenever  I think of letting their troops come in here and their  officers I can see nothing but death &amp; darkness before me and  before this people but when I say they shall not come here  light bursts upon me and I can see life before me &amp; this people and this is the way all of this people feel. the intention  of the Government is to destroy us &amp; this we are determin  they shall not do. If the government of the United  States persists in sending Armies to destroy us in the name  of the Lord we shall conquer them. if the Government  calls for volunteers in Calafornia &amp; the people turn out to come  to destroy us they will find their own buildings in flames before  they get far from home &amp; so throughout the United States  again if they commence the war I shall not hold the Indians  still by the wrist any longer for white men to shoot at them but  I shall let them go ahead &amp; do as they please and I shall carry the war into their own land and they will want to let  out the Job before they get half through and even should an  Armey of 50000 men get into this valley when they got  here they would find nothing but a Barren waste we should burn evry thing that was wood &amp; evry acre of  grass that would burn and you may tell them that they  must bring with them their forage for their animals  for they will not find any thing to eat in this Territory  when they come, again you may tell them they must stop  all emigration across this continent for they cannot travel  in safety the Indians will kill all that attempt it. You may tell Judge Douglass that when He comes here again to enter  into a treaty of peace we shall dictate those terms of peace  &amp; not him as He did before.    if our Government pushed forward this thing &amp; made war  upon us He should withdraw from the Army for he would  not have a hand in sheding the Blood of American Citizens After closing  set up his kingdom upon the Earth &amp; it was here &amp; the Lord  would sustain that kingdom &amp; he would destroy all that  fought against it And if the Armies of the United  against us the Lord would permit them to be destroyed at the  close of the remarks the President said to Capt Van Vleit as citizens  we are friends &amp; shook hands in a Friendly manner and   ENDENTRY   &amp; put up a Box of peaches of 32 dozen for Hon J.

All Prophets or Apostles or inspired men of God who have written or spoken concerning this Generation whether Recorded in Records revealed or sealed have pointed out clearly the events as they have transpired  and as they will transpire before our Eyes. It has now been over 30 years since Joseph Smith the prophet received the  gold plates from the Hand of the Angel Moroni from which He translated the Book of Mormon And it will be 28 years the  6 Jesus Christ was organized upon the Earth containing 6 members This little Branch of the Church like a small mustard seed has been nourished by the hand of God through all of its difficulties afflictions and persecutions, untill it is becoming the greatest off all herbs according to the parable of the Saviour who refered to it. It has continued to grow and flourish in the midst of a  strong warfare and opposition of wicked men and Devils  Untill it is growing into a kingdom in the midst of these moun- tains and Everlasting Hills as spoken of by Daniel and other Prophets. The Church and kingdom of God has had to wade through a scenery of persecution oppression and Blood inflicted  upon her by the inhabitants of the United States from its first commencement up to the present time untill many have been slain  and martered for their religion including the Prophet Joseph  who was the founder of the Church in this dispensation who was  shot in Hiram by a wicked and  hellish mob. As the Church has increased so has the opposition  increased against it untill the inhabitants of cities, towns,  counties and states  to destroy the saints of God from off the Earth. The governors  rulers and people have all been united in this persecution and inasmuch as the Saints of God continued to grow and thrive the  whole United States Government with President James  Buchannan at there head have sent an Army of 2500 men to lay a foundation for our destruction. The Saints of God have  prayed that the Lord would hedge up their way that they could  not come into our valley to shed our Blood or that we need not  shed their Blood and the Lord has heard the prayers of his saints and has hedged up their way they came as far as Forts Bridger  &amp; supply on the East side of the mountains and there have to remain  for the winter while we are still enjoying our homes and Firesides in peace to all human appearance that Great Nation the  United States with 25000000 of souls are determined to  Expend their treasures &amp; use their force for the Destruction  of the Church and kingdom of God from of the Earth who  are now dwelling in thes vallies of the mountains. But we trust   ENDENTRY   feelings of Deep interest to the Events of 1858 Believing that God  will preserve his saints and chastize his Enemies. The wicked  know not what they do "Darkness covers the Earth and gross darkness the people." "The Heathen rage and the people imagin vain things they say let our Eye look upon Zion and let her be defiled" "but they know not the thoughts of the Lord neither understand they his ways"  "The Lord will have them in derision, He will laugh at their calamity &amp; mock when their fear cometh." Their destruction will come suddenly upon  them as a whirl wind and no power can Deliver them. The measure which they have meeted unto the saints, and seek to bring upon them shall be meeted unto them again as a Nation, as states, counties, towns,  cities, and families untill evry man who does not draw his sword  against his Neighbor will be oblieged to Flee to Zion for safety And  these things shall shurely come to pass for the Lord God has spoken it. Then prepare yourself O Land of America for the judgments of the God of Heaven await ^you^ and are nigh even at your doors For the Lord hath looked down from his Holy habitation and hath beheld all your  wickedness and abomination and all the Evil designs of your hearts  and all your secrets plans for the destruction of the Saints of the  Most High, for all these things God will bring you into Judgment and He will require the stewardship at the Hands of the President of  the United States and at the Hands of the senators, and Represen- tatives, and Govornors, and Judges, and all the Rulers of the Land  will all be he &amp; blessings put into their hands and the whole people of the Land  who Elect the officers of Government will be held responsible for the conduct of those officers as well as their own conduct  in their dealings with the church and kingdom of God upon the Earth. Let us watch the signs of the times of 1858 And we shall  find that the Lord will soon come out of his hiding place and in his fury he will vex the Nation and in his hot displeasure he will  begin to cut off the wicked and unjust stewards and appoint them their portion with hypocrites and unbelievers.
