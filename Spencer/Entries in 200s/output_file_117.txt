 Nauvoo, Ill. September 15, 1845.Bro. W. Woodruff: Ido not often trouble myfriends with letters, on account of amultiplicity of business, which deters mefrom writing. We are now in theemidst of another great mob. Fromfifty to sixty houses have been burntin thes Green plains and Lima branchesof the church, and of course two orthree hundred people thrown houselessinto the naked air to perish. TheFrench drove the Arabs into thecave and smoked them to death, butthe Americans drive the saints outof their houses, burn them, andleave the inmates to famish: whichexhibits the most shocking barbtyarity,in this christian age?Last night bro Fellows, 4 miles this sideof Carthage, had his house, barn, and grainburnt.Writz are out for the "Twelve" and othersupon the grave charge of Treason.We are at peace in Nauvoo. TheTemple is finishing rapidly. The steepleis outwardly finished and looks grand. 
 The Nauvoo house has arisen within threeweeks nearly two stories.We have had a good season for grainbut, I some fear, unless the Sheriff andproper authorities raise force enoughto disperse the mob, that much willbe burnt. However, I have no reflectionsto make, while the devil has hiz day.The saints, if they live godly in ChristJesuz shall suffer, as they alwayshave, persecution.You know we wait patiently for the"when"—Thus saith the Lord, and"then," blessed be the name of theLord, we shall be "free indeed:"having come up through great trib-ulation.We have not had so sickly a seasonas last year, though many havechills and fever lightly.I was at Bro. Benbow's the otherday: he was down with the new ague & feverbut not bad. Your little ^willy^ was heartyas apig buck.Under the management of the "Twelve"every thing has flaurished so visibly,that no one can doubt but the Lordreigns with saints in Nauvoo.We have had a paradise summer. 
 I often think "O for a lodge in somevast wilderness:"some boundless contiguity of shade" &cwhere percutions would cease, but in a moment I reflect no cross no crown,and go aheadLight as a cloud in yonder sky,to gain the bliss of those on high,In the bounds of himand Everlasting covyoursW.W.

 Nauvoo, Ill. June 1845Dear Brother in the Lord:Ever engaged in thinking or writing, I have very little time to bestow upon friends,but, with a holy desire for the Twelve, asGod's special ambassadors, for this generation,I take a moment. I sent you "come to me,"last winter, and shall send the "capstone"by br. Fielding.As I am a descendant of the "Royalfamily," my forefather's name being 'Guelph'till Cromwell expelled one to America, andfor propriety he changed it to "Phelps'. I havea great anxiety for the salvation of QueenVictoria and her posterity, as heirs of a better and more lasting kingdom—whereinthe blood of Joseph will be exalted asKings and priests to God, and shall reignwith Christ upon the earth a thousandyears.Every thing moves forward in the United States as if Jehovah's wisest servantswere determined to usher in a day,(with the co-operation of Jesus and his angels,)of righteousness and peace; a day whenthe children of Israel will be gathered home, 
 to fulfil the ordinances written, and "multiplyand replenish the earth and subdue it," ac-cording to the first commandment to Adam,which, as yet remains, in statu quo.The Times and Seasons and neighbor contain aliving stream of my mind and so you cansatisfy yourself at leisure.The Temple ascends "on high" rapidly: theattic story looks grand, and we allpray that it may speedily be finished, andthe endowment follow.The Rigdonites have labored day and night,during the late triall of ^the^ assassins for themurder of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, toscare up a mob, but On[e] who saidto the raging sea, "Peace be still," hassent forth a few hot snaps of fire aboutthis country, and now and then a cold dropof hail—and left them and others to [think]on oh in their wickedness.We all say—God bless you ElderWoodruff and family; and Br.

 INTELLIGENCE COMES FROM GOD, ETC. 227INTELLIGENCE COMES FROM GOD--SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD--GREAT CHANGES TO TAKE PLACE ON THE EARTH--ISRAEL OFTHE LAST DAYS--WHY THE JEWS CANNOT BE CONVERTED.A discourse by Elder Wilford Woodruff, Delivered in the Tabernacle, Great Salt LakeCity, February 22, 1857.I feel it a privilege to bear testi-mony before the Saints to the exhor-tations we have heard this morningfrom brothers Richards and Wells. We have had good teachings, good counsel, and good doctrine taught us. And I presume I feel in a measure like the rest of my brethren when I rise to speak to this people in theTabernacle, where such large congre-gations of Saints assemble; I have a desire that what I say may do thepeople good, may edify them. My bre-thren also have the same desire.We realize that the minds of this people need feeding continually, andwe all have to depend upon the Holy Spirit and the Lord to feed our mindsfrom that inexhaustible fountain of intelligence which comes from God,for we cannot obtain food from any other source to feed the immortalmind of man. Here are a large as-sembly of minds who are reachingforth to receive light and truth before the Lord.I realize that we have a great manylessons to learn in the school we arein, and myself as a teacher in con-nexion with my brethren have alsoa great deal to learn. I feel that I am yet in my alphabet, and feel some-times that I am incapable of teaching this people, when I realize they are inthe road which leads to celestial glory --to eternal life and eternal exalta-tion. I know I am dependent as Iknow my brethren are upon God,upon the Holy Ghost for all the light,truth, and intelligence which we haveto impart unto you.The words which brother Wells quo-ted, and which brother Samuel Rich-ards referred to, furnish as strong aproof as can be furnished as to thetrue principle of prosperity, touchingthings temporal and things spiritual. I refer to the words of Jesus Christ which he spoke to his followers: "Seek first the kingdom of God andhis righteousness, and all other thingsshall be added unto you." I will tellyou, brethren and sisters, we may tryit all the days of our lives, we may try every path and every principle in this world, and we as Saints cannotprosper upon any other mode of pro-ceeding than by first seeking the kingdom of heaven and its righteous-ness; when we do this there is no blessing, there is no good, no exalta-tion, gift, grace, desire, or anythingthat a good man can wish that is pro-fitable, and good for time and for eter-nity, but will be given unto us.A great many people have tried to seek for happiness independent of firstseeking the kingdom of heaven, &c., but they have always found it an up-hill business, and so shall we if we try it.We as a people should have learnedby this time, after having the experi-ence we have gained, to make up ourminds to take hold and build up thekingdom of God, and it should be 
 Trust in the Lord.228     JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.the first thing before us, for if webuild up the kingdom of God we buildup ourselves, and if we do not we nevershall be built up.  This is the truth. There seems to be something connect-ed with the kingdom of God and that is righteousness; we are exhorted to seek the righteousness that belongs toit as well as the kingdom itself.The kingdom of God is a righteouskingdom, all its laws are righteous,its government is a righteous govern-ment, and the king who governs andcontrols it does so upon righteous andeternal principles, and we must actupon the same principles of righteous-ness. Who cannot see that if a manseeks first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness that he will become righteous and hence he will be blessedand justified in all of his acts.With regard to the feelings of thepeople that brothers Wells and Rich-ards have referred to, touching the consecration of their property and de-dicating themselves to God, I will say,if we build up the kingdom of Godwe should be in that kingdom, and all we have should be in it, and we shouldhave faith enough in the Lord to know it is in a safe place.I am a good deal of the opinion of old Captain Russell, who was an ex-tensive ship-builder, and paid thou-sands of dollars yearly to the Gentiles as insurance fees. After he embraced"Mormonism," he began to reflect, "here am I paying thousands of dol-lars yearly to the Gentiles to insure my ships, and I have to trust to theGod of heaven after all to save my ships from sinking, and to prosper mein all my undertakings; this is not right." So he went to Liverpool, where the insurance office was, to settle his insurance bills and close uphis business with the firm.The gentlemen of the firm askedhim when he had got through, saying, "Have we not treated you well, Mr. Russell?" "Yes, I have no fault to find with you." "What, then, is yourobject in pursuing this course? We have done business with you a goodmany years; we want to know if youare going to change your insurance office?"  "I am."  "Will you tell us where you are going to have yourbusiness done in the future?"  "Yes, I am going to have it done in heaven,for the insurance offices do not controlthe winds, the elements are not obe-dient to them, and I have been payingten thousand dollars a-year for insuringa few ships, and I have to trust in the Lord anyhow, so in the future I shall pay my insurance fee into the Lord's treasury."The gentlemen of the office thoughthe was cracked or beside himself, forI tell you trusting in the Lord inthese days is an unpopular businesswith the world.  But the Saints have to trust in the Lord, and we might aswell begin and seek this kingdom and the interest of it, and the righteous-ness of it, and build it up first as last.  I believe the people are reforming inthis thing; I believe they are increa-sing in their faith, and have manifes-ted it here in the city this winter, andI am glad to see it.The exhortation we have had thismorning is proper and seasonable, aswe have been sowing the seed of the word this winter among the people, and we should watch and see that theseed is sown in good g[r]ound, and tryto cultivate the principles we hear that the fruits of righteousness mayappear in abundance.  In doing thiswe will be saved.We have had one of the most in-teresting seasons this winter that we have ever enjoyed since the Church and kingdom of God has been organ-ized in the last days.  We have hadnew lessons opened unto us by theservants of the Lord, and among thosethings the mercy of the Lord has been manifested in a great degree to-wards this people.  I have reflected 
 INTELLIGENCE COMES FROM GOD, ETC.     229on His mercy and I feel we should befaithful and humble, and prove trueunto the Lord our God because ofthis mercy which has been manifested unto us, and we should be very care-ful hereafter, as President Young ex-horted us the last time he spoke con-cerning this people continuing to com-mit sin.  He plainly laid before usthe consequences of this course; we should let the past suffice wherein wehave done anything in which we can-not be justified.  I am satisfied that the people in these valleys will neverhear the same proclamation which wehave heard this winter.If this people with the light they have, the teachings they have, andthe examples they have had set beforethem intermingled with chastisement--if they still will go on and be neglect-ful of their duties, with regard to their salvation they will have to pay the debt, for the sinner in Zion will be cut off from the Church of God, andwill have to pay the penalty whether it be small or great.  It is of the ut-most importance that we should guardourselves against sin as the tree of life is guarded.  We have no time to throw away in the service of sin, in committing iniquity and grieving theHoly Spirit of God.I tell you when you look around and see the state of the world on theone hand, and what we have to per-form on the other, and what the king-dom of God has got to arrive at inorder to fulfil its destiny and the re-velations of Jesus Christ, our chief object should be to build up the king-dom of God and roll it on.As I remarked last evening in the High Priests' Quorum, we have beenrolling this kingdom up-hill, up amountain; we have been toilingagainst a mighty current all the daylong from its first organization, butthe day will soon come, if this peoplewill do their duty and take hold of the kingdom of God as they shoulddo, it will soon get on the top of the mountain, and then it will begin toroll down from the mountains, and itwill gather both strength and speed as it goes, and then instead of sing-ing, "Get out of the way, the hand-carts rolling," it will be "Get out of the way the kingdom's coming," andit will not stop until it has filled thewhole earth.  The Lord has pro-claimed this in all the revelations Hehas given on the subject.This kingdom has got to stand,spread itself abroad, and gather unto itself strength.  The Lord is going to work with this kingdom, and with this people.  The Lord says inthe parable of the vineyard, "My ser-vants laboured with their mights, andthe Lord laboured with them, and they prevailed, and brought forth the fruitsof the kingdom, and the bitter brancheswere broken off, and the tame olive brought forth good fruit, and the vine-yard was no more corrupt."  This should be uppermost in our minds,we should look for the building up ofthe kingdom, and secure not only blessings for ourselves, but seek tobecome saviours of men on MountZion, and try to do all the good wecan, labouring to promote the causeand interest of Zion in every depart-ment thereof where we are all called to act.By pursuing this course we shallbe prospered, and have continual peacein our minds, and as the Lord has said, nothing will be withheld fromany man that seeks for the righteous-ness and blessings of the kingdom ofGod.  Salvation should be the upper-most thing with us, and you will findif ever we seek to do something elsebesides carrying out the dictates of the Holy Spirit, we will get into the fog and into darkness and trouble, andwe shall be ignorant of the way weare pursuing.  Every day that we live we need the power of the Lord--the power of His Holy Spirit and the 
 REMARKSBy Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF, Bowery,Sunday Afternoon, Aug. 26, 1860.REPORTED BY JOHN V. LONG,Brethren and sister, we are blest above allother people upon the face of the earth, notonly temporally but spiritually. I considerany people blest of the Lord to whom he hasrevealed the gospel of Jesus Christ, to whomhe has given the holy priesthood and authori-ty to administer in the ordinances of his house.That people are greatly blest, far above theirfellow men who do not enjoy this privilege.I consider this to be our position to-day; wehave the privilege of walking in the light, wehave the privilege of comprehending andknowing the truth, of knowing the way to besaved and exalted in the presence of our Fa-ther and God. We are in a position to knowhis mind and will, through his servants thethe prophets. The Lord has given unto usteachers and inspired men, men who are in-spired by the spirit and power of God; clothedthem with truth and endowed them with wis-dom to teach us at all times the path weshould walk in. This is a great blessingwhether we realize it or not.The Lord looks down upon our work andconsiders our ignorance, and so do those holybeings who surround his throne, but yetwe know enough to do our duty, magnifyour calling and fulfill the object of our crea-tion. And any man or community whohave the gospel of Christ, the holy priest-hood and the power of the Holy Ghot thatwe have, possess a great advantage overthe world, for they do not comprehend,they do not see nor understand the thingsthat await them. They do not understand thedealings of God with them in any respect.It is not so with the Latter Day Saints, for aslong as they continue to receive the truth their minds are opened to understand the characterof the day and age in which we live, and allthose trying scenes that are approaching us;the veil is taken from off the face of the earth,and we see things, to some extent, as they are.We have received the gift of the Holy Ghostby the laying on of hands, and the veil of darkness, of doubt and fear is taken from our minds, and we can see clearly where to go anwhat to do, and we feel that our spirit is right,that we are acceptable before the Lord ourGod, and are the subjects of his blessings.When sitting here and listening to the wordsof the servants of God I reflect day by day onthe things of God that are revealed to us, andI am inevitably led to the conclusion thatthere is no people upon the face of the earthenjoying such great blessings as the Almighthas bestowed upon us. The heavens are fullof blessings, and the Lord is willing to bestowthem upon us. The hearts of the servants ofGod are full of blessings, comfort and edifyingwords for the saints. Then it is certainlyour duty to make a right use of the knowledgewe have received and to acknowledge thehand of the Lord in all things. We should tryto gain wisdom, knowledge and understand-ing, and from the experience we are hav-ing while in this great school. This wouldstimulate us to action, and inasmuch as we dothis, and walk in the light of truth we shallbe satisfied, and continue to do as we havebeen taught. By pursuing this course in ourconnection with the work of God we are en-abled to drink of that well of water thatsprings up into everlasting life.I do not believe that any man in the worldwho has power, wealth, influence and a goodunderstanding of things is satisfied with thepresent confused state of the world, eitherreligiously or politically, neither do I believethat a man who does not know God nor theprinciples of eternal life and salvation; a man,for instance, that has come to an understand-ing of the world, and that has received thebenefits of civilization, as understood by thegreat mass of christendom; I do not, I say,believe that such a man is or can be satisfied.I can readily believe that the professors of re-ligion are not fully satisfied in their minds andfeelings, unless they have partaken of thatlife which is made manifest by the gift andinfluence of the Holy Ghost. And we havean abundance of evidence to prove that theworld are not satisfied with their condition,not even those that are seeking the pleasuresof life, we frequently hear them complainingof the state of affairs at the present time.Man possesses a spirit that must endureforever, a spirit that comes from God, and in-asmuch as he is not fed from that same source or power that created him he is not and can-not be satisfied. I can say from my own ex-perience, that although I sought for the truthdiligently I was never satisfied until I heardthe fulness of the gospel proclaimed by theLord's chosen servants. I had no inspiredman to say "this is the way, walk ye in it."It is true that I could read the Bible, I couldpray and to some extent know what was rightand proper for me to do, at least so far asmoral religion was concerned. I enjoyed aportion of that spirit which in those daywould lead a man to do good to his fellowman, but of course I had not the knowledge of God. But in these days when the holy priest-hood is restored to us we have no excuse forsaying that our minds are not satisfied, forthe blessings are given to us, they are withinour reach, and it is your privilege and mine toenjoy them.I feel to rejoice greatly in the blessings ofthe gaspel that are given to us, and that wecan behold so visibly the hand of God in hisdealings with this people. He has foughtour battles and given us victory.We are all sensible of our imperfections,[column break]but notwithstanding these things the Lord hasbeen true to his word; he is fulfilling his word,and has been doing this from the beginning.When I look at these things my heart rejoices,and I feel to give thanks to the Lord and to aidall I can in the building up of his kingdom.We can enjoy the true comforts of the HolyGhost, we should honor our calling and betrue to the convenants we have made. if weattend to our duties and walk humbly beforethe Lord, we shall be satisfied with life, andwith the manifestations of the goodness ofGod unto us.Let me advise you, brethren and sisters, toimprove everything that is good, performevery duty devolving upon us, and weshall have much joy and consolation at theclose of this probation in knowing that wehave done the best we could, that we haveacted up to the best light we had. It certain-ly must be a satisfaction to us to know thatwe are building up the kingdom of God, toknow that we are seeking to overcome the powers of darkness, and all evil that prevailsupon the face of the earth, in our day and gen-eration. This gospel has been offered to thepresent generation, it has been offered to thechristian world, and almost all the nationshave heard it in some way or other, and theynow have the privilege of receiving or reject-ing it.This poeple have received the word withjoy and gladness, and many of them havebrought forth fruit to the honor and glory ofGOd, and have been valiant in the cause ofJesus Christ; they are friends of God, friendsto themselves and to their fellow men. Butwhen men reject the gospel, the gifts, the promises and blessings that are presented andoffered unto them they come short of theirduty and are under condemnation.The Lord has said by the revelator John,in speaking of this work, that at the hourof his judgement he would send an angel, whoshould fly through the midst of heaven withthe everlasting gospel to preach to every na-tion, kindred, tongue and people, crying witha loud voice, saying fear God, and give gloryto him, for the hour of his judgment is come.The Almight has in this way warned thisgeneration, and told them what the resultof reject the gospel of Christ would be.Still many in the world have sought to destroythis work from the earth, as well as those whohave been its advocates.Scores and hundres of the elders of Israelhave been faithful and true to their integrity,and for this they will have their reward, whilethe wicked will perish. I do feel thankfulthat so many of us have cleaned our garmentsof the blood of this generation; and I rejoicethat we are located here in these valleys ofthe mountains. I do not know that I could bein any better place than this. We are shutup in these chamers of the mountains infulfillment of the words of the lord, and hehas led us all the time, he has marked outour course and directed our footsteps. Br.Joseph Smith, br. Brigham Young and all ourleaders have been inspired from the beginningto give counsel and to do those things thathave been required of them, and they wereled here by the inspiration of the Almight,as much so as moses, or any others who haveheld the priesthood. President Young prophe-cied the deliverance of this people, and hiswords were backed up by the testimony of the Holy Ghost, when, to all human appearancethere was no arm could save us, and we weredelivered by the power of God. If we live ourreligion we shall see more manifestations ofthe goodness and power of God.It is our privilege to follow the dictates ofthe spirit of the Lord, and to have it for ourguide and companion, and by doing this theblessings of the heavens will be upon us asfast as we are prepared to receive themI know that the devil seeks to overthrowthis people, and it seems that the powers ofdarkness have, to a great extent, prevailed intheir attempts to control the hearts of thechildren of men. For many generations thepowers of darkness have had almost universal sway, but I thank God that I have livedto see the day when the kingdom of God hasbeen set up upon the earth, and that it is nomore to be thrown down forever. Men withwicked hearts may seek to pull down thecause of truth, but all their efforts will be invain, for the blessing of the Almighty is uponhis saints, the inspiration of the heavens isupon his servants, and they will overcome thepowers of temptation and of the adversary.It is verily true that we have a warfare toengage in, for Satan seeks to engage in onewith us, with our children, and with all therising generation,—the hope of Israel, and ofthe prophets and apostles of this kingdom.I feel that the time has come when we shallprevail, and I rejoice in it. I feel that theLord is going to bless this people abundantly.The minds of the saints are expanding andthey are coming to understanding. This cer-tainly should be the case as we advance, forthe Lord will make a short work in the lastdays, and there is but little time, if I may beallowed the saying, to have the words of the prophets fulfilled.There is a good spirit here. The righteousnessand truth, and the power of God are nowprevailing over the wickedness of the profaneand the iniquity of the depraved, and thepower of the devil is fast giving way and los-ing its hold on this people. The power ofGod is in the ascedant, and the faith of thesaints holds the powers of darkness at bay,so that they cannot carry out their evil de-signs in the midst of Zion. This is a conso-lation to me, and my heart rejoices in thesethings, and I can say truly that I feel happyand comfortable, and I pray that the Lord willsustain and uphold those that are set to lead[column break]The Lord is their guide, and there is nota man nor a woman in Israel but who knowsthat they are govered and controlled by thepower of God, if they are living up to theirprivileges.Israel was not always led with the samedegree of clearness and understanding that weenjoy in our day. This is a great blessing tous, and we ought to be faithful, and full ofthankfulness. I feel happy in saying that Iknow our leaders are upheld by the prayers ofthe brethren and sisters, not only in this Ter-ritory but throughout the world. This is right,and just as it should be, for it is our duty in oursecret places, in our family prayers, to remem-ber the Lord's annointed and chosen servants;and we should not only pray for them, but foreach other; be full of faith, prayer and confi-dence; and manifest our faith by carrying outthe counsel that is given by the leaders of thispeople. Yes, brethren and sisters, it is agood day and generation in which we live; itis a good time to worship God and live faith-ful to our religion, and this is a most splendedplace in these valleys of the mountains for us tolive and improve. We are blest with good land,with water and timber, and here we have theprivilege of saving our children, and this is agreat blessing unto us. If we set a good examplebefore our children, and try to instruct themfrom their childhood to maturity; teach themto pray and to honor the Almight; teachthem those principles that will sustain themin the midst of all trials, that the spirit of theLord may rest upon them, and then they willnot easily be led astry. Good impressions will follow them through life, and whateverprinciples may be presented those good im-pressions will never leave them.I have long been satisfied that the devil wasmaking great exertions to drive a wedge inbetween parents and children, trying to in-spire and instil into the minds of the sonsand daughters of the saints those corruptingnotions that will prevent them from followingthe footsteps of their fathers and mothers,but this cannot be done! The sons and daugh-ters of this people, if we do our duty, will beheld by the strength and in the name of Isra-el's God.I have looked upon this matter a great deal,and I have concluded that there never was ageneration of people upon whose shouldersrested greater responsiblities than rest uponthis people, and than must rest upon their sonsand daughters. If this be true, how import-ant it is that we would be wise father andmothers, and that we should act wisely in in-stilling into their youthful minds all thoseprinciples that will lead them to that whichis just, and to carry out in their lives the prin-ciples of righteousness and truth. Many ofour children have not had experience in theworld; they know nothing of the scenes andcorruptions that are among the wocked; theydo not realize their present positions, nor theblessings conferred upon them by their parentshaving obedyed the fulness of the gospel.We who have gained experience see thedarkness and abominations that are in thehearts of men, but our children, not being ableto contrast the evil with the good, cannot seeand realize the blessings they enjoy in beingunder the influence of teachers in Israel; I donot refer to their parents alone, but those wholead and govern in the midst of Israel.I have felt for a long time and I think I haverealized to some extent, that the duties rest-ing upon us are very great, and that we oughtto strive to improve in wisdom and knowledgeand in the principles of government in orderthat we may know how to be fathers, mothersand saviors, and learn how to be councilors,and how to preside, not only in our own familycircles, but wherever we may be called toact. It is a great thing to know how to actso as gain the feelings and affections of our families, that will lead them in the pathwherein they may be saved. This is a studyand a work that should not be laid aside byparents, nor by the Elders in Israel.Many times we may consider business sourgent that it must crowd these things out ofour minds, but this should not be. Any man'smind that is open, and who looks forward tothe work that lies before us, will see and feelthat the responsibility that rests upon himconcerning his own family, and especially inthe rearing up of his children, is very great.We want to save our children, and to have them partake of all the blessings that en-circles the santified, to have them receive theblessings of their parents who have been faith-ful to the fulness of the gospel. We do notwant them to go through all the routine offalse doctrines and erroneous systems that wehave had to wade through in our generation.This is the way we feel in regard to ourpresent position, and i feel that God willbless us inasmuch as we strive to improve andlisten to council. It is our duty to pray beforethe Lord, and to teach those principles when-ever we have an opportunity. And I feel tothank the Lord, and to teach those principles when-ever we have an opportunity. And I feel tothank the Lord, and to rejoice in seeing asmany as there are who are willing to listen tothe counsel of their parents; for I realize thatwhen they are called upon to act in theirpriesthood and ministry, they would be readyand willing to listen to the counsel of theirbrethren, and thus they will be the means ofsaving the rising generation.I pray that the Lord, may bless us and giveus largely of his spirit, that our minds maybe clear to see and comprehend this greatwork. This kingdom is but yet a very smallstone, comparatively speaking; it is not yet a great mountain, neither has it filled thewhole earth, but as the Lord lives, it will.This is how I feel, and I sincerely desire thatwe may have our minds opened upon the sub-ject of the building up of the kingdom of God.In this we shall have joy, no matter whether[column break]in prosperity or adversity; so long as we doour duty the Lord will protect us, and thepowers of evil will have no dominion over us,but our hearts will be buoyant and we shallrise step by step in wisdom, knowledge andpower until we shall be able to build up thetemples of our God, behold the law of theLord, go forth from Zion, and the word of theLord from Jerusalem. This law he intendsthat we should receive to prepare us for thecoming of the great bridegroom. In both ourtemporal and spiritual labor we should seek toknow the mind and will of God concering us;we should have the Spirit of the Lord with uscontinually, and our mediations should berighteous and holy before the Lord.We cannot go to reap our crops and wor-ship the devil one day, and then the nextgo into the Tabernacle or temple of the Lordand worhsip him. That is not our religion, itdoes not admit of this; we cannot feel justi-fied in such conduct, but if we live our religionthe blessings of Almight God will be withus, and he will multiply them upon our heads.I hope and pray that each and all of us maydo this, that we may seek to sustain eachother, and those whom the Lord has placedover us, which may God grat for Christ'ssake. Amen.

And if we will so live before the Lord,the Spirit will reveal to us every day what our duties are; I do not carewhat it is we are engaged in, we should first find out the will of theLord and then do it, and then our work will be well done and acceptable before the Lord, but if we take a courseagainst light and against the Spirit of God, we will find it an unprofitable road to travel.I feel as though the Lord is going to do a great work in the midst of thispeople.  There are a great many thingsat our door, a great many changes to take place in the earth, and the king-dom is growing; and I would here exhort all the Latter day Saints whohear me this day to study well the position you are in, and search yourhearts and see if we are in the favour ofthe Lord our God, and then let us in-crease continually in faith, in hope, inrighteousness, and in every virtuousprinciple which is necessary for us tohave to sustain us in every trial through which we may be called topass, in order to prove us as the friends of God, whether we will abidein the covenant or not; we will be tried from this time, until the coming of the Messiah or while we live on theearth.If we could open the vision of ourminds, and let it extend into the fu-ture and see this kingdom, and whatit is bound to accomplish, and whatwe have to do, the warfare we have topass through, we would certainly seethat we have a great work on hand.  We have not only to fight the powers of darkness, the invisible forces thatsurround us, but we have to war witha great many outward circumstancesand to contend with a great many dif-ficulties that we must of necessitymeet, and the more of this we have tomeet the more we should be stimula-ted to action, and to labour with all our power before the Lord for the es-tablishment of righteousness and truthand the building up of the work of God, and to see that His name ishonoured upon the earth.Brother Wells has said, why theworld is troubled about us is becausewe are united. This is true; the world and the devil are afraid of it, and he has laboured all his life to di-vide everything where righteousness dwelt, or at least ever since he was cast out from the presence of God,what he did before that I cannot say any further than what is revealed.  We have got to be one and labour to-gether to build up this kingdom be-cause we cannot establish it upon anyother principle.We should be careful to know thatwe are right and then go ahead, and we will find it to our advantage, and we shall be satisfied with our reward if we pursue that course which is ac-cording to the commandments of God. When we come into the presence of our Father in heaven we shall meet with His approbation, this alone willreward us for our labours.If we go to work and build up the kingdom of God instead of ourselves,it is no matter in what shape we doit, whether it is in building a canal, or in building a temple, preaching the Gospel, cultivating the earth, oranything else, let us take that andmake it a business, and we will find the Lord will help, sustain, and nerve us with His power, and will assist us in everything we have to do, and if we are called to lay down our lives in the defence of Godand eternal truth, then all right, andif we live, all right, and when wecome into the presence of the Lordwe shall be satisfied with our rewardand blessings.The Lord has said He would proveus whether we would abide in Hiscovenant even unto death; indeed wehave been tried from the commence- 
 INTELLIGENCE COMES FROM GOD, ETC.           231ment of this great work, but therehas been an invisible hand at workfor our defence all the time; thewicked have not seen the power that has sustained us, they cannot see theinside machinery that is at work inthis kingdom, the nations of the earthcannot understand it, and they nevercan comprehend it, but the Latter-day Saints understand it, and they know that it is the power of God and theword of God, for the Lord has made proclamations and decrees, and cove-nants concerning Israel in the last days, and all the Prophets, from righteous Abel to Brigham Young,have proclaimed it to the nations of the earth, as with the voice of thun-der, and we know they will be fulfil-led; we know the Gospel has to be offered to the Gentiles first, we have offered it to them for the space of twenty-five years, that we may be pre-pared to go to the house of Israel.The Gentiles in a great measure, have rejected it; we have borne a faithful testimony to the nations ofthe earth, and they prefer to take their own course, and act on their ownagency; they would rather build them-selves up than the kingdom of God. The consequence is, it will soon be taken from the Gentile nations, and it will not be long before the judgments of God are abroad among them, and those bitter branches will be taken off the tree.Now there is no personage, or sub-ject, or work upon the face of the whole earth, but what is more popularthan the Lord, and His Gospel, and kingdom; His name is dishonoured and blasphemed, with impunity by nearly all the inhabitants of the earthand in the midst of every nation un-der heaven, but the day is nigh at hand when He will make bare Hisarm of power, and show the world thatthere is a God in Israel, who will no longer bear the blasphemies of the wicked without bringing them to judg-ment, but He will send forth thoseangels, those messengers who dwellin the presence of God, who arewaiting with their sharp sickles intheir hands to reap down the earth;but this will not be until the Gospelhas been fully offered to the Gentiles;then the bitter branches will be bro-ken off.This kingdom will go forward, for the Lord God has decreed it, andZion will arise and be adorned withbeauty and power, and true refine-ment, in light and knowledge, and in every good gift that will prepare the minds of men for the Society of theirHeavenly Father and of celestial beings.  These lessons have got to begiven, and we have to learn them, and we have got to bring ourselves tothe celestial law of God; we have to be quickened by the Spirit and powerof the kingdom of God and its righ-teousness, that we may be prepared tocarry out the purposes of the Lord; then this kingdom will be borne tothe house of Israel, and they will re-ceive it.The door has already been unlockedto the Lamanites in these mountains, and they will begin to embrace the Gospel and the records of their fa-thers, and their chiefs will be filledwith the Spirit and power of God, and they will rise up in their strength, and a nation will be born in a day,because they are of the seed of Abra-ham, and God has promised to bless the descendants of Abraham, and theywill be saved with the house of Israel,for the Lord has spoken it, and made those promises unto them throughtheir fathers.Again, here are the ten tribes of Israel, we know nothing about themonly what the Lord has said by HisProphets.  There are Prophets among them, and by and by they will come along, and they will smite the rocks, and the mountains of ice will flow down at their presence, and a high- 
 232             JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.way will be cast up before them, andthey will come to Zion, receive their endowments, and be crowned underthe hands of the children of Ephraim,and there are persons before me in this assembly to-day, who will assistto give them their endowments.  Theywill receive their blessings and en-dowments, from under the children of Ephraim, who are the first fruits of the kingdom of God in this dispensa-tion, and the men will have to be or-dained and receive their Priesthoodand endowments in the land of Zion, according to the revelations of God.Again, here is Judah, which is the tribe of Israel, from whom Jesus sprang; how many time have I seenthem among the nations of the earth,standing in their synagogues, even grey-haired rabbies, with their faces to theeast, calling on the great Eloheim toopen the door for them to go back toJerusalem, the land of their fathers, and to send their shiloh, their king ofdeliverance.  When I have seen this mysoul has been filled with a desire to proclaim unto them the word of Godunto eternal life, but I knew I could notdo this, the time had not come, I could not preach to them.  I might have stoodin their midst for a month and preach-ed unto them Jesus Christ or their shiloh and king, but I should have failed to establish one particle of faithin their minds that he was the true Messiah.They do not believe in Jesus Christ;there is an unbelief resting upon them,and will until they go home and re-build Jerusalem and their temple more glorious than at the beginning, and then by and by, after this Church and kingdom has arisen up inits glory, the Saviour will come to them and show the wounds in his hands and side, and they will say to him, "Where did you get those wounds?" and he will answer, "Inthe house of my friends," and thentheir eyes will begin to open, and they will repent and mourn, they and their wives apart, and there will be afountain opened for uncleanness to thehouse of Judah, and they will for the first time receive Jesus Christ as theirSaviour, they will begin to compre-hend where they have been wanderingfor the space of two thousand years.You cannot convert a Jew, you may as well try to convert this house of solid walls as to convert them intothe faith of Christ.  They are set in their feelings, and they will be untilthe time of their redemption.  They are looking forward to the time whenthey will go home and rebuild Jerusa-lem; they have looked for it many hundreds of years, they are looking for the coming of their king, and theydo not suppose for a moment that hehas already come, but they are lookingfor him to come as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, not as a lamb led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that isdumb before his shearers; they arelooking for him to come with power and great glory.I thank God that the day is at hand when the Jews will be restored.I have felt to pray for them; I feel interested in their behalf, for they are of the seed of Abraham and a branch of the house of Israel, and the pro-mises of God still remain with them.It is true they fell through unbelief, and the kingdom was taken from them and given to the Gentiles, and whenit came from them, it came clothed with all its gifts, powers, and glory,Priesthood and ordinances whichwere necessary for the salvation ofmen, and to prepare them to dwell inthe presence of the Gods; and when the kingdom was given to the Gen-tiles, they for a while brought forththe natural fruits of the kingdom.But they, like the Jews, have fallenthrough the same example of unbelief, and now, in the last days, the king-dom of God has to be taken from the Gentiles, and restored back to every

 REMARKSBy Elder W. WOODRUFF, delivered in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,January 1st, 1871.Reproted by DAVID W. EVANS.I wish you all a happy new year, and I hope that we may live to see a good many,and that we may keep the commandmentsof God, obey His laws and have His appro-bation and blessing upon us as a people.We have assembled here on this,-the firstday of the week, and the first day of the year 1871; and this leads my mind to re-flect upon the age and generation in whichwe live, and the great events of the latterdays,-events which involve the interestsand destiny of all the inhabitants of theearth,-both Zion and Babylon, Jew andGentile, Jerusalem, American and thewhole world.  All nations are interestedin the events which are approaching us, andwhich await this generation; for whetherthe world believe it or not, they are of vast interest to them all.  There have been cer-tain times looked forward to in the world'shistory, in which it was believed that some-thing remarkable would occur, and there have been several of these periods duringthe last fifty years.  I do not know that anything was predicted at an early daywith regard to 1830; but I recollect, when aboy at school, of reading a certain verseabout a great eclipse of the sun"In eighteen hundred and thirtyone,Will be a great eclipse upon the sun."I heard about this fifteen years before it took place, it having been foretold by the as-tronomers, by the principles and laws of the science of astronomy.  On that day Iwas passing through a forest of pinewood,at Farmington, Connecticut, going to seemy father, whom I had not seen for sometime.  It was nearly as dark as night, andwhen I got through, into the open fields,there was what is termed a poor house, theonly house erected within several miles inthat region of country.  A poor man haddied there and they were drawing his bodyon an ox sled and were going to bury him.I noticed this as I passed along, and thoughtof what I had read; but nothing of any par-ticular interest occured that year exceptthe eclipse of the sun.  But in 1830 some-thing occured of great interest to all the inhabitants of the earth: that was the es-tablishment of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Many persons have looked forward to the year 1860 with great interest; and thishas been the case with many of the Latter-day Saints.  What took place in that year?The dissolution of the American Union,for in that year the South took a standagains the North, and the North against theSouth, in fullfillment of a certain revelation given by Joseph Smith, thirty years-before it took place.  Joseph Smith pre-dicted that there would be a great rebel-lion in the United States,- the South andthe North warring against each other, andthat this rebellion would commence in South Carolina, and would end in the deathand misery of many souls; and that in process of time,- after many days, theslaves would rise against their masters, andthat one nation would call for aid upon another, for war would be poured uponthe whole earth.  I wrote this revelationtwenty-five years before the rebellion tookplace; others also wrote it, and it was pub-lished to the world before there was anyprospect of the fearful events it pre-dicted coming to pass.Joseph Smith once said in a speech at Nauvoo, to a company, that whosoever lived to see the two sixes come together in '66 would see the American continent del-uged in blood.  This was many years be-fore there was any prospect of a rebellion.The history of '60 and of '66 is before theworld, and I do not wish to spend time inreferring to it.We have got by '30, '60, '66 and '70, andwe are now living at a period when everyyear is big with events of interest to theinhabitants of the earth: and they will con-tinue from this time until the coming othe Lord Jesus Christ.  Many men haveset times for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, among whom, living in our ownday, we may mention Mr. Miller.  He settimes and days for the appearing of the Messiah, and has said that He would sure-ly come on such a day.  Now if Mr. Mil-ler had been acquainted with the propheciescontained in the Bible, and with the spiritby which the scriptures were written, hewould have known very clearly thatChrist would not come until certain eventshad taken place.  He would have beenaware that the Messiah would not makeHis appearance until an angel of God haddelivered the everlasting gospel from theheavens to be preached to the nations of theearth; until the honest and meek of theearth are gathered out from every sect,party and denomination under the wholeheavens; until the Zion of God had gone upinto the mountains of Israel and there es-tablished Zion, and lifted up a standard tothe people.  Mr. Miller and all who havebelieved like him, had they understood thescriptures and possessed the spirit of truth,would hav known that Christ would notcome until the Jews had returned to theirown land and had rebuilt the city of Jerusa-lem and the temple there; they would haveknown that all these and many other pro-phecies must have been fulfilled as a pre- 
 INTELLIGENCE COMES FROM GOD, ETC. 233branch and tribe of the house ofIsrael; and when it is restored tothem, it must go back with all itsgifts, and blessings, and Priesthoodwhich it possessed when it was taken from them.  But the Lord has said that in restoring these blessings to thechildren of Abraham, that He would be inquired of by the house of Israel,to do it for them.  But from what branch or part of the house of Israel will the Lord look for this petition orrequest to issue, if not from the Lat-ter-day Saints, for we are out of thetribe of Joseph through the loins ofEphraim, who have been as mixedcake among the Gentiles, and are thefirst fruits of the kingdom, and the Lord has given unto us the kingdomand Priesthood and keys thereof.  Hence the Lord will require us to ask for those blessings which are pro-mised unto Israel, and to labour fortheir salvation.These things will be required atour hands; a great work is before us,a work worthy of intelligent beings--worthy of the most noble of spirits that ever existed around the throneof God in time or in eternity, in hea-ven or on the earth.  Then, if we would feel right about this importantsubject, and look upon it as it is, wewill go to work and labour with allour mights to build up the kingdom ofour God, to carry out the purposes ofthe Lord, in the building up of Zion,the establishment of his kingdom, andrestoration, and salvation of the houseof Israel; we should listen strictly tothose men who are the word of the Lord to us.The Prophet Jeremiah saw this kingdom established, and saw thatEphraim was the first born, and ingathering the children of Jacob and establishing Zion in the last days, their nobles should be of themselves, and their governor should proceed from the midst of them.  I have looked forward for years by faith tothat time when the children of Zion would have the privilege of having their rulers, and a governor of theirown choice of the house of Israel, to rule over them and counsel and lead them.We have had a governor since wehave been a Territory, who is actually of the loins of Joseph, the son of Jacob. Jeremiah saw this, spake of it,and it has been fulfilled.  There hasbeen a great exertion to make thisprophecy fail.  It hurts the feelings ofthe Gentiles to think this prophecy should have its fulfilment in thesedays.  It has been fulfilled so far, andI feel thankful to-day that all the prophecies which have not been fulfil-led will be; hence I have hope and confidence in looking forward to thefulfilment of the blessings that are promised to us.Let us be faithful and seek dili-gently to build up the kingdom ofGod in righteousness and do our duty, and try to save ourselves, our wives,and children, our kindred and ourfriends, and the house of Israel, andalso the Gentiles as far as they will besaved, and then we will be satisfied with our reward which we shall obtainin this life and in the world to come. I pray the Lord to bless us all, andsave us in His kingdom, for Christ'ssake.  Amen.

This churchhas been established by raising up pro-phets, unto whom have been given thekeys of the kingdom of God,---the keys ofthe holy priesthood and Apostleship of theSon of God, with power to organize thechurch and kingdom of God on the earth,with all its gifts, graces, ordinances andorders, as proclaimed by all the apostlesand prophets who have lived sincethe world began. It is because of this thatwe are here to-day. In fulfillment of proph-ecy and revelation we have established akingdom, as it were, a state, a nation, apeople here in the deserts of North Amer-ica. We have planted six hundred miles ofcities, towns, villages, gardens, orchards,tabernacles, and temples by the commandof God, for the hand of God is in all thesethings, and they are in fulfillment of revel-ations given in the Bible, Book of Mormonand Doctrine and Covenants, in our dayand in ancient days. This is the work ofthe Lord, and all the scriptures, from thebeginning of Genesis to the end of Revela-tion point to this day as one of great inter-est to all the human family; although asone said of old, "As it was in the days ofNoah and of Lot so shall it be in the daysof the coming of the Son of Man." In thosedays they were marrying and giving inmarriage, and when Noah went into theArk, and when Lot fled out of Sodom, theinhabitants of the earth through their un-belief were ignorant of the destructionawaiting them.At the present day darkness covers theearth and gross darkness the minds of thepeople; nevertheless they are living in anage of the world more fraught with interestto the human family than any precedingage or generation since the creation. Thereis no hundred years, no thousand years,no two thousand years since God made thisworld and placed Adam in the Garden ofEden when there was as much prophecy,revelation, vision and word of the Lordand promises of God to be fulfilled as thereis in the generation in which you and Ilive. This is the great dispensation of alldispensations. This is the time to whichall the prophets of God have pointed, andin which they have declared the great latterday work of God should be established.And I will here say that, many times, while a boy, when reading the testimonyof John, given on the isle of Patmos,whither he had been banished for the testi-mony of Jesus Christ, and for the word ofGod; while reading the account he gives ofthe pouring out of plagues and judgmentson the inhabitants of the earth, I have mar-velled that the Lord should do such a work.But I do not wonder at it to-day: thescenes have changed. When I was a boy,fifty years ago, the kingdom of God had notbeen established among men; the angels ofGod had not visited the earth; the LordAlmighty had not clothed His servantswith the priesthood and commanded themto go and warn the nations of the earth ofthe judgments which awaited them.There was not the wickedness then thatthere is to-day. The wickedness com-mitted to-day in the Christian world intwenty-four hours is greater than wouldhave been committed in a hundred yearsat the ratio of fifty years ago. And thespirit of wickedness is increasing, so that Ino longer wonder that God Almighty willturn rivers into blood; I do not wonder thatHe will open the seals and pour out theplagues and sink great Babylon, as theangel saw, like a millstone cast into thesea, to rise no more for ever. I can seethat it requires just such plagues and judg-ments to cleanse the earth, that it maycease to groan under the wickedness andabomination in which the Christian worldwelters to-day. I can see the necessity forthe Lord stretching forth His hand, estab-lishing His kingdom, warning the nations,and gathering out the honest and meek ofthe earth from among all nations, kindreds,tongues and people, sects and parties underthe whole heaven, and preparing them tostand as the bride, the Lamb's wife, as theChurch of Jesus Christ, as the kingdom ofGod, adorned with goodly apparel, adornedwith the light of Zion, with the principlesof eternal life, with the gospel of JesusChrist, preserving within themselves thevirtues and attributes which have madeGod what He is, established Him on His throne, and given Him the power whichHe now possesses. I can say this,---theLored will never come to visit an earth likethis; He will never come to visit a gener-ation of the inhabitants of the earth untilthey are prepared for His coming and are willing to receive Him.This is the foundation of Mormonism;this is the foundation of the Church andkingdom of God, which was laid in 1830.The church was established on the 6th ofApril in that year. Its history and thehistory of this people are before the world.We ourselves have learned it by shoe-leather. Many of the Elders of Israel havetravelled a hundred thousand miles topreach the gospel during the last fortyyears without purse or scrip; we have la-bored day and night, and traveled as noother generation of men since the worldwas made have travelled. Our garmentsare clear of the blood of this generation, atleast many of us, and I hope many morewill be. We have been true and faithful inour testimony to the inhabitants of theearth; and as the world generally has re-jected our testimony the Lord has with-drawn His spirit from the people in agreat measure; and the religion they onceenjoyed is as nothing to many of them.Infidelity prevails throughout the world;very few, either priests or people, believein a literal fulfilment of the Bible. Theyhave a theory, but as to believing in a realfulfilment of prophecy, or that the Lordmeant what He said and said what Hemeant, that is out of the question,---veryfew believe it.I want to ask a question:---Will the un-belief of this generation make the truth ofGod without effect in our day any morethan it has in any other age of the world? Itell you nay, and think not, as Paul says,that I am your enemy because I te^l^l youthe truth. These things are true beforeGod; this is the Zion of God, and these arethe people of God; and we, as Latter-daySaints, should live our religion better thanwe do; and as we are now entering on an-other year I hope we shall try to live ourreligion through this year, and do our dutyand keep the commandments of God andwalk uprightly before Him, that we maybecome united as the heart of one man.There are great events, as I have alreadysaid, before us. The fact is, the Lord haslaid down a great many premises concern-ing the latter days, and they are going tobe fulfilled; for though the heavens and theearth pass away not one jot or tittle of theword of the Lord will fall unfilled; andwhen our nation and the nations of theearth have filled their cup and are ripenedin iniquity the Lord will cut them off.The greater the battle the sooner it will end;the greater the warfare the greater thevictory, if the Saints do their duty. Thesethings are before my mind, in the vision ofit, and the Lord will not fail in anythingHe has promised concerning the work ofthe latter days. Whatever opposition thischurch and kingdom may have, it is thework of God. The Lord has planted andsustained it. Jesus compares the Kingdomof Heaven to a mustard seed, the least of allseeds, but by and by when it grows it be-comes a large tree, so the fowls of the aircan lodge in its brances. So it has beenwith the Kingdom of God; but we are toldthat the little one will become a thousand,and the small one a strong nation, andthe Lord will hasten it in His own time.The Lord says "I will break every weaponformed against Zion; and every nation,kindred, tongue and people that will notserve Zion shall be utterly wasted away."When I see the world making warfareagainst the Zion and people of God becausethey have borne record and testimony ofHis work on the earth I can tell prettywell what the end will be, I can see it. Weare living in a time when the work of Godis going to increase in interest every dayuntil it is wound up. No man knows theday or the hour when Christ will come,yet the generation has been pointed out byJesus himself. He told His disciples whenthey passed by the temple as they walkedout of Jerusalem that that generationshould not pass away before not one stoneof that magnificent temple should be leftstanding upon another and the Jews shouldbe scattered among the nation; and his-tory tells how remarkably that predictionwas fulfilled. Moses and the prophets alsoprophecied of this as well as Jesus.The Savior, when speaking to His disci-ples of His second coming and the estab-lishment of His Kingdom on the earth,said the Jews should be scattered and trod-den under foot until the times of the Gen-tiles were fulfilled. But, said He,when you see light breaking forth amongthe Gentiles, referring to the preaching ofHis gospel amongst them; when you seesalvation offered to the Gentiles, and theJews,---the seed of Israel, passed by,---thelast first and the first last; when you seethis you may know that the time of mysecond coming is at hand as surely as youknow that summer is nigh when the figtree puts forth its leaves; and when thesethings commence that generation shall notpass away until all are fulfilled.We are living in the dispensation and generation to which Jesus referred;---thetime appointed by God for the last six thou-sand years, through the mouths of all theprophets and inspired men who have livedand left their sayings on record, in whichHis Zion should be built up and continueupon the earth. These prophecies willhave their fulfillment before the world; anda^l^l who will not repent will be engulphedin the destructions which are in store forthe wicked. If men do not cease from their murders, whoredoms, and all thewickedness and abominations which fillthe black catalogue of the crimes of theworld, judgment will overtake them; andwhether we are believed or not, these say-ings are true, and I bear my testimony asa servant of God and as an Elder in Israelto the truth of the events which are goingto follow very fast on each other.The Lord is going to make a short workin the earth; He is going to cut it short inrighteousness, or no flesh would be saved.What Brother Rich has said to-day is true.These principles will sustain us. Virtuousand godly principles---the principles of thegospel will, in the end, come off triumphant;and they will sustain and preserve anypeople who practice them, whether theyare popular or not in the estimation of theworld. All who embrace the principles ofthe gospel of Christ will be saved by them.He that abides a law will be preserved by it.Any man who abides the law of the goseplwill be saved and receive exaltationand glory by it. Let us remember these things, for all that has been spoken con-cerning this Zion of God in the mountainswill come to pass. It is the work of God,and His eyes are over it; the heavens be-hold it. Every prophet and apostle whoever bore testimony to this work, is watch-ing us with the deepest interest; they watchour labors and faithfulness, and are anxiousabout the course we pursue. Many of themdesired to live in our day, but had not the privilege. We have been permitted to see and live in this great and eventful age of theworld. The God of heaven has put intoour hands the gospel, the priesthood, thekeys of His kingdom, and the power to re-deem the earth from the dominion of sinand wickedness under which it has groanedfor centuries, and under which it groans to-day. Let us lay these things to heart, andtry to live our religion; so that when we getthrough we may look back on our lives,and feel that we have done what was re-quired of us, individually and collectively.The Lord requires much at our hands,---more than He has ever required of anygeneration that has preceded us; for nogeneration that has ever lived on the earthwas called upon to establish the kingdomof God on the earth, knowing that it shouldbe thrown down no more for ever. Danielsaw this; the Prophet Isaiah has spoken of it;in fact three-fourths of all his predictionsrelate to the establishment of the kingdom ofGod in the latter days; to our persecutions,to our travels to these valleys of the moun-tains, to the lifting up of the standard tothe people on the mountains of Israel; tothe casting up of the great highway---thisnational railroad, which the ransomed ofthe Lord should walk over, and on whichthe Gentiles should come to the light ofZion, and kings to the brightness of herrising.These things are to come to pass in ourday, and the beginning has commenced,and the end will come by the power ofGod and in fulfillment of His promises;and it is at our hands the work is required.Therefore I feel to bear my testimony to-day that this is the work of God, thatJoseph Smith was a prophet of God, andthat Brigham Young is a prophet of God,and is inpsired, led, dictated and directedof the Lord, and has been very profitableto the Latter-day Saints, and is doing allhe can for the salvation of the world. Sodid Joseph Smith, while he lived. Hecame in fulfillment of prophecy, accom-plished what was required of him, laidthe foundation of the work, received thekeys of the priesthood and apostleship, andevery gift and grace in the organization ofthe church necessary to carry it on. We are called to build on the foundation he laid, until Zion shall arise and put on herbeautiful garments and the people of Godbecome united as the heart of one man;until the little stone, cut out of the moun-tain without hands becomes a mountainand fills the whole earth, and accomplishesall God has spoken concerning it.Brethren and sisters let us unite togetherand be faithful, and live our religion everyday, and do our duty in 1871 as in any ofthe years that are past and gone since wehave been acquainted with the Gospel ofChrist. If we do this we shall come offtriumphant. The God of heaven is ourfriend, and blessed is that people whoseGod is the Lord. Blessed is that peoplewho do not turn to any other God but theliving and true God.May God bless you, bless this assembly,bless us as a people, and the honest andmeek of the earth everywhere, and prepareus for the great events which await thisgeneration for Jesus' sake, Amen. 
 NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL, ETC.DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVERED IN THE NEW TABERNACLE, SALT LAKE CITY, SUNDAYAFTERNOON, SEPTEMBER 16, 1877.(Reported by Geo. F. Gibbs.)NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL—THIRTY YEARS PROGRESS IN THEMOUNTAINS—THE GOSPEL UNCHANGABLE—JOSEPH INSPIRED—PRESI-DENT YOUNG'S WORK—WORK OF THE TWELVE—LABORS IN ST.GEORGE TEMPLE—GATHERING OF THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD.It is with much pleasure and sa-tisfaction I again stand before theSaints of God in this Tabernacle.A year nearly has passed since I en-joyed this privilege, my labors hav-ing been directed elsewhere. What-ever I may say to you depends en-tirely upon the dictation of the HolySpirit. And I may say that we allneed the inspiration of the Almightyto dictate us, whether we preach orlisten, and not only in our publicgatherings but in all of our laborsconnected with the building up of thekingdom of God, yes, just as muchas the Saints of God did in everypast age and dispensation.I can truly say as the Apostle Paul said, "For I am not ashamed of theGospel of Christ; for it is the powerof God unto salvation to every onethat believeth." [##Romans 1:16##] I am not ashamedof what the world is pleased to call"Mormonism;" I am not ashamedof any revelation that God has givenunto the Latter-day Saints, throughthe mouth of modern Prophets; Iam not ashamed to acknowledge my-self a firm believer in the literal ful-filment of the Bible, as well as everycommunication of God to man, al-though I am well aware that theScriptures have been more or lessspiritualized by the whole Christianworld, especially during the lasthundred years. I believe that holymen of old wrote and spoke as theywere moved upon by the Holy Ghost,and that they meant what they saidand said what they meant, and thatthe Apostle Paul spoke truly whenhe said, "that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpre-tation." [##2 Peter 1:20##] The Lord has taught us in a modern revelation contained inthis book, the "Doctrine and Cove-nants," that it matters not whetherhe speaks from heaven by his ownvoice, or by the ministration of an-gels, or by the mouth of his servantswhen they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost, it is all the same themind and will of God; and althoughthe heavens and earth pass away,my words would not fall unfulfilled. [##Doctrine and Covenants 1:38##]I desire more particularly to ad-dress myself, this afternoon, to the Latter-day Saints; and at the sametime if any of the strangers presentcan receive any benefit from my re-

 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.marks, I shall be glad of it.Our position, to-day, before theheavens and the earth and beforeeach other, reminds me of days thatare past and gone. On the 20th ofJuly, 1847, I brought our late Presi-dent Young in my carriage throughEmigration Canyon into this val-ley, which was the first time he setfoot upon this land. The question has been often asked by strangerswho visit our city, why did Brig-ham Young pick upon this spot tobuild a city? Because it was shown him before he came here. But when we came to this country, whatdid we find here? A barren desert,as barren as the Desert of Sahara;and the only signs of life were a fewblack crickets, some cayote wolves,and a few poor wandering Indians.To-day we may travel from Paris inthe north of our Territory to St. George in the south, a distance of some 500 miles, and see on everyhand towns and villages, gardens,and orchards, fields and crops; webehold a people industrious andhappy, building their own dwelling-houses, meeting-houses, school-houses,tabernacles and Temples, and im-provements and enterprises are con-stantly going on. And all thiswithin so short a time. What doesthis mean? What does it bespeakto the strangers who visit our Terri-tory, and in fact to the whole world,and to heavenly as well as mortalbeings? It is evidence that Godhas set his hand to fulfil the predic-tion contained in the Bible, that hehas commenced the work of unitingthe record or stick of Joseph withthat of Judah; that the set timehas come for him to favor Zion.And how have these things cometo pass and what was the originof this peculiar system that presentsitself now to the inhabitants of theearth, which found a resting-place inthe wilds of this desolate, uninhabitedland, and which has already producedsuch marvellous results? It wasperformed in a very singular manner,to begin with. As the Lord ever hasdone in attempting to establish hisrule and government on the earth,he chose the weak things of the earth, and them he will use to con-found the wisdom of the wise. Hemanifested himself to a boy in histeens, and also sent an angel tohim on several occasions, in fulfil-ment of the revelation to John theRevelator, and of the inspired wordsof many other Prophets and Apostleswho have spoken concerning themarvellous work and wonder of thelatter-days. But says the world,"We do not believe that." We un-derstand that perfectly well; we donot expect you to receive the Gospel of the Son of God with the samereadiness that you believe the false-hoods and misrepresentations thatare constantly made about it. Theworld ever has opposed it, and weexpect to meet all manner of opposi-tion until the final triumph of rightover wrong, of truth over error. Wemight commence with father Adamand trace it down to the present time,and we would find that the samespirit of opposition and of persecu-tion followed the people of God inevery age, as exists to-day againstus, as a people. And so natural isit for the devil to oppose every movethat the Lord makes towards re-claiming and redeeming the earth,that men are often found to de-nounce the "Mormons" and theirreligion when they know nothingeither of us or our tenets. The Sa-vior of the world himself was de-nounced as a deceiver, as an imposter;why? Because those who raisedthis cry against him knew him not,and those who re-echoed it took notthe trouble to ascertain whether it 
 NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL, ETC.was true or false. And it has beenprecisely in the same way that thenames of Joseph Smith and Brig-ham Young have been had for evilby the masses of this enlightenedage. The Savior said of those thatrejected him, that he was hated bythem because he testified of theirworks, which were evil. And soverily it might be said of those whodecry against the men who, in thisrespect have not been more favoredthan their Master. Through themlight has dawned upon the world,and because men choose darknessrather than light, their deeds beingevil, they find their opposite in"Mormonism," and in all those whofaithfully adhere to it and advocateit.Through this boy, inexperiencedand unlearned as he was, the Lordorganized this Church on the 6thday of April, 18[3]0, with only sixmembers; and it can be said of himas of no other man in Christendom,that he was the instrument in the hands of God of presenting to the world a system of religion, a Churchorganization complete with all thekeys and powers of the Holy Priest-hood, and that through him hasbeen imparted to the religious worldmore light and knowledge than allthe professors of religion combined,with all their boasted intelligenceand learning. And when he pub-lished to the world this new yet olddoctrine, even the everlasting Gos-pel, it was found to agree precisely with that taught by the Savior, andthe Church organization was afterthe same pattern as the one insti-tuted by Him, although the Gospelhad not been preached since it wasdriven away from the earth by theiron hand of persecution. One ofthe peculiar features in the faith ofthe Latter-day Saints is that we be-lieve there is but one Gospel, thatthere never has been nor never will beany other, and that that Gospel neverchanges from one generation to ano-ther, and that it consists of the sim-ple principles taught by the Saviorand contained in the New Testament,which principles never deviate onefrom another. The first was faithin the Lord Jesus Christ; the se-cond was baptism in water by im-mersion for the remission of sins,and then the laying on of hands forthe reception of the Holy Ghost;and this was the kind of doctrinetaught by Christ and his Apostles,and this was the doctrine that Jo-seph Smith preached. In doing sohe stood alone in the world, and hehad to meet the traditions of eighteenhundred years, traditions which hadbeen handed down from generationto generation, which were entirelyopposed to the doctrine which theLord had revealed to him, and whichhe was commanded to preach. Youand I were taught from our youththat there was no such thing as newrevelation, it was all done away;and this same tradition is being im-bibed by the youth of Christendomto the present time. Ask the min-isters, the men to whom people lookas their spiritual guides, why they donot enjoy the gifts and graces and thelight of revelation from heaven, andwhat is the universal reply? It isin substance, "Oh, these things are all done away, they are no longerneeded; it was necessary that theyshould exist in the dark ages of theworld but not in these days of theblaze of Gospel light." WheneverGod had a Church upon the earth-these gifts were enjoyed by the peo-ple. The sick were healed of theirsickness, the lame were made to walk,the blind to see, the dumb to speak,etc., through the administrationsof those among them who held thePriesthood, which authorizes men 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff wasthe next speaker. He en-dorsed the remarks of BrotherSmith. He felt they were due.Such occasions as these were admo-nitions to us. In Adam all died, but in Christ all were made alive. Beforethe speaker became acquinted withthe fulness of the Gospel death hadto him an appalling gloom. Sincethen, however, he had felt to mournbut little at the death of any Lat-ter-day Saint. The speaker had been acquinted with BrotherHooper a good many years. In his Congressional career he had faith-fully represented the people. This probation was short, but it was as important as any position we everhad or even would occupy, in its re-lation to eternity. Inasmuch as the family of the deceased were faithfnlthey would again receive a home inassociation with their head and pro-tector. A good many of those whohad been a long time associated with the work of God would probab-ly soon pass to where Brother Hooperhad gone. It would amply pay usto do all the good we could inthis life, that we might allrejoice together in the future. Bro-ther Hooper was an affection-ate husband and father, a kindlyfriend, and he would be greatlymissed in the channels in which hemoved. But we could not keep him here. The speaker concluded with a forcible exhortation to hishearers to live in such a way in thislife that they would secure eternalhappiness in that beyond.

Cannon said : Mybrethren and sisters and freinds,it is with feelings which I am utterlyunable to express that I stand beforeyou this afternoon—feelings on the one hand of gratitude to my Heav-enly Father, that after an absence ofnearly three years from this city Iam again permitted to meetwith mybrethren and sisters in this place,and with feelings on the other handof intense timidity in standing be-fore so large an audience. But I rely, my brethren and sisters, uponyour faith and prayers during thefew moments that I may stand beforeyou, and I rely, furthermore, uponthe promise which our Lord gave,when He said, " Where two or threehave gathered together in my name,there I am in the midst of them."I am satisfied, on my own part, thatwe, this afternoon have assembledourselves in the name of the Lord,and I am consequently satisfied thatHis Spirit will be with us inasmuchas we seek for the same, inasmuchas we rid ourselves of every feelingof worldliness and come togetherwith pure hearts to partake of the emblems of the death and sufferingof our Lord, and to become in-structed in the plan which He haslaid down for our salvation.It four days since I returned froma mission, and in six weeks it willhave been three years since I leftthis city, in obedience to a call madeupon me by the authorities of theChurch. On the 9th of August,1881, I left this city on a mission toGreat Britain, in company witheleven other missionaries, who weredestined for Scandinavia. We

 Wilford Woodruff, one of the twelve apostles, then took the stand, He de-livered the same sermon verbatim [illegible][illegible] that he has delivered fromtime immemorial from the same stand.He said, "We occupy an entirely dif-ferent position from the rest of the world in regard to the principles ofthe gospel. There has never been anapostle on the earth from Adam's timedown to the present who has not hadto suffer persecution. The earth isfilled with the power of darkness andthe power of light. Lucifer and his [illegible] cohor[ts] were driven out of heaven, and the devil don't care what youpreach so long as you don't preach thegospel of Christ.God had a father and a grandfatherand the grandfather had a father, andso had the sun and the moon and thestars a father. God has [illegible] revela-tion in these last days, and this gospelis true and we know it. Very few menhave strength of charactor enough or have enough independence of mind toembrace this gospel and undergo thepersecutions which it entails. Themoment you embrace this gospel youincur the condemnation of the pressand the pulpit of the country. We areopposed, as you know, by the wholeChristian world.Well, there is that talk about polyg-amy. Well, what about it? Why we were persecuted in Missouri and 10000of us driven out of Jackson county be-fore we ever practiced polygamy.What does the world care about ourpolygamy? It is used by them merelyas a [illegible] against us. Wepractice polygamy for the samereason that we practice all our otherordinances, because we are commandedby revelation to do so. Look at howmany women are saved for eternity byit! Why not be in a position to claimyour wives and children after death?There is where I stand and that iswhere President Taylor stands andthat is where the prophet JosephSmith and President Brigham Youngstood.The Gentiles say you take thesewives to gatify your lust. We answerthat by saying "Ain't there a way in the Christian world by which wecould satisfy our lusts in a cheaperway and without having so muchtrouble? If we married only forlustful purposes we would not be verywise. We look upon adultery as nextto robbery. God gave Abraham andIsaac more wives in order that theymight have them after death.Without the pristhood this ordin-ance could not be performed. We shallpuursue this course as long as God seesfit for us to pursue it. The heavens are full of revelations, full of light andtruth, and the Holy Ghost continues togive revelations. I pray to God to giveus grace to allow us to magnify ourcalling."

The entire Territory bearsmarks of his genius and enterprise;and the Lord certainly crownedhis labors with success, as he hasblessed the labors of his brethrenwho have not spared their handsor their hearts in assisting him.And instead of the work of thelatter-day stopping, or its progressbeing retarded in consequence ofthe death of our beloved President,it will move forward with acceleratedspeed, until Zion arises in beauty,and power, and dominion, in fulfil-ment of the inspired words of Pro-phets and Seers who have spoken,and who, while wrapt in heavenly vision, saw our day.It cannot be a very great whilebefore many of us will follow him.I have traveled with him for some forty-four years of my life, and during those years I have neverknown him to waver or flinch inthe performance of his duties. Hehas performed an honorable missionto earth, and while his body sleepshis spirit lives, and he continueshis labors, strengthening the handsof Joseph, and Hyrum, and Jede-diah, and Heber, and George A.,and all those who have been trueand faithful to God and to manwhile upon the earth, who are nowengaged in the same great cause ofredemption and salvation. AlthoughPresident Young has finished hisearthly career and mission to thisearth, the work has only commenced.The Gospel must be thoroughly andfaithfully preached to every nationunder heaven, and the Lord holdsus responsible, for verily the trusthas been imposed upon us, and itbehooves us to see to it. I havetraveled more or less for the lastforty years, without purse or scrip,and I have been sustained by thehand of the Lord, and so have my brethren. Our Elders who are calledconstantly from the plow and theworkshops to go forth into the worldand preach the Gospel, travelingfrom place to place on foot, withoutpurse or scrip, and although they arenot trained in colleges or seminariesof learning, yet they are sustained and enabled to cope with the learnedand wise, and the honest in heartreceive their testimony, which isaccompanied by the Spirit of God,and the Holy Ghost.Before I close, I want to say onething to the Latter-day Saints, whichis resting upon my mind. PresidentYoung having now passed away, his labors with us have ceased for thepresent. He, with his brethren,built and completed one Temple,also laid the foundation for one atManti and one at Logan, and besidesa great deal of work has been doneon the one in this city. He left this unfinished work for us to carry on tocompletion; and it is our duty to rise up and build these Temples. Ilook upon this portion of our min-istry as a mission of as much import-ance as preaching to the living; thedead will hear the voice of the ser-vants of God in the spirit-world,and they cannot come forth in themorning of the resurrection, unlesscertain ordinances are performed, for and in their behalf, in Temples built to the name of God. It takesjust as much to save a dead man asa living man. For the last eighteenhundred years, the people that havelived and passed away never heardthe voice of an inspired man, neverheard a Gospel sermon, until theyentered the spirit-world. Somebodyhas got to redeem them, by per-forming such ordinances for themin the flesh as they cannot attend 
 TESTIMONY GAINED. 203reached Liverpool in due time, andI wasassigned,shortlyaftermyarrivalthere, to the London Conference,where I labored with great pleasureuntil the 17th of March, 1882.Early in the month the then Presi-dent of the European Mission—Apostle Albert Carrington—notifiedme that I should proceed to the German Mission, and within a fewdays after receiving this notice Ijoined my brotherin NorthGermany.Of course in going to Germany I hadto learn the language ; I was utterlyignorant of it when I started andwhen I landed there ; but the Lordstrengthened my memory, and in ashort time I was able to make myselfunderstood, and pursue the realobject of my mission. I labored—it is not for me to say with how muchsuccess—until relieved a short timeago to return home.I can say, my brethren and sis-ters, that I have enjoyed my missiongreatly. The blessing of the Lordhas been with me. The promisesthat were sealed upon my head bythe Presidency before I went havebeen literally fulfilled, and, to mymind, in a most remarkable man-ner.Above all things I prizemymissionfor the testimony it has given me ofthe truth of this Gospel. It mayseem strange to you that I make thisassertion ; because one would natu-rally think that I had a testimonybefore I went. I, however, confessthis was not the case. I had heardwhat the world calls Mormonism—from my childhood up I had heardnothing else. I believed as muchas it was possible that this, the Gos-pel as preached by the Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,was the true religion, andwas the path of redemption as pro-claimed by Jesus Christand His Apos-tles. This was my firm belief. Buta direct and firm and steadfast testi-mony of the truth of the Gospel Ihad not received, and it was to ob-tain this testimony, more than foranything else, that I obeyed the callthat was made of me. I had heard,as you had, that every man whoreturned from a mission and rose upin this stand or elsewhere to proclaimhis testimony and to report hislabors—I had heard every man say :" I know this is the Gospel of JesusChrist." And I felt within myself,if I can acquire a knowledge of thetruth of the Gospel through goingon a mission, I am willing to go. Ivalued my salvation and a knowledgeof the truth of the Gospel just thatmuch. Well, I went, and I laboredwith great weakness, I have no doubt.But the Lord heard my prayers. Hegranted unto me a testimony of thetruth of the Gospel, and from thetime that I received the first oneuntil this moment, one testimonyhas followed another in rapid succes-sion. I am therefore able to proclaimbefore you, as I have done with much pleasure before the world, thatI do know that God has spoen inthese our days, that He has revealedHimself and restored his Priesthoodby means of which the human fam-ily—those of them who are willingto be saved and to obey the require-ments which He has given—may besaved.It was told me before I startedaway—the remark was made to meby my father : " My son, you willfind in the world that the nationsare about in the same condition as the Athenians were when Paul wentto preach to them. They have tem-ples and they have altars built, butthese are dedicated to the ' UnknownGod.' " I found this to be the truth.I found the word, the written word ofGod was read in every church inevery land, and the every family 
 Wilford Woodruff, president of thechurch, took the stand and stated he,too, in former years, had had consider-able experience as a missionary laborerin the Southern States. He had metwith considerable opposition in thosedays, not only on account of his beinga hated "Yankee," but also on accountof his efforts to baptise slaves. On alloccasions he considered it his duty,when endeavoring to convert theseslaves, to consult their masters, andthe labor was sometimes not very en-couraging, and when the consent ofthe masters was obtained it was oftenwithout the least consideration on thepart of the slave master as to the wel-fare of his servant, the response of oneof these masters being characteristicin this respect: "I don't care," he said, "what in hell you do with him,so long as you don't stop him hoeingcorn."To-day, happily, the eyes of theworld are being opened, and thousandsare learning to know Zion, and the peo-ple of God who inhabit it.

Even so faith, if it hath not works,is dead, being alone."—JAMES 2:14, 17.No. 21. Vol. LVI. Monday, May 21, 1894. Price One Penny.DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.THE following discourse on "The Law of Adoption" was delivered byPresident Wilford Woodruff, at the Sixty-fourth Annual Conference of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, held in the Tabernacle, SaltLake City, Sunday morning, April 8, 1894:—I feel thankful for the privilege of meeting with so many of the Latter-day Saints this morning. In order to present my position before theSaints I wish to say that I have been a member of the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints over sixty years, a member of the Quorum of the Apostles fifty-five years, and the President of the Church for a shorttime. During all these years, and in all my travels, I have never seen amoment when I have had the power to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christor to administer in any of the ordinances of the House of the Lord,acceptably to God or to myself, only by the assistance of the Holy Ghost;and I do not know of any other man that could ever do this. Even theSon of God, in referring to His work, said: "I do nothing of myself; butas my Father hath taught me, I speak these things." So it has been withall the prophets and patriarchs in every age of the world; they have hadto be assisted by the power of God. I occupy that position to-day beforethis assembly. Therefore, as the Lord commanded us not to speak onlyas we are moved upon by the Holy Ghost, I desire that, and in order toobtain it I want the prayers and faith of the Latter day Saints.I have some things resting upon me that I wish to present before theLatter-day Saints, and in order to do this I will call upon President GeorgeQ. Cannon to read from the Book of Doctrine and Covenants concerningthe subject which I wish to speak upon.President Cannon read from Sec. 128, as follows:— 
 NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL, ETC.to themselves in the spirit, andin order that this work may bedone, we must have Temples inwhich to do it; and what I wish tosay to you, my brethren and sisters,is that the God of heaven requiresus to rise up and build them, thatthe work of redemption may behastened. Our reward will meet uswhen we go behind the vail."Blessed are the dead which diein the Lord from henceforth: Yea,saith the Spirit, that they may restfrom their labors; and their worksdo follow them." [##Revelation 14:13##]We have labored in the St. GeorgeTemple since January, and we have done all we could there; and theLord has stirred up our minds, and many things have been revealed tous concerning the dead. PresidentYoung has said to us, and it is verilyso, if the dead could they would speakin language loud as ten thousandthunders, calling upon the servantsof God to rise up and build Tem-ples, magnify their calling and re-deem their dead. This doubtlesssounds strange to those present whobelieve not the faith and doctrine ofthe Latter-day Saints; but whenwe get to the spirit-world we willfind out that all that God has revealedis true. We will find, too, thateverything there is reality, and that God has a body, parts and passions,and the erroneous ideas that existnow with regard to him will havepassed away. I feel to say little elseto the Latter-day Saints whereverand whenever I have the opportu-nity of speaking to them, than to call upon them to build these Tem-ples now under way, to hurry themup to completion. The dead willbe after you, they will seek afteryou as they have after us in St. George.They called upon us, knowing that we held the keys and power to re-deem them.I will here say, before closing,that two weeks before I left St.George, the spirits of the dead gath-ered around me, wanting to knowwhy we did not redeem them. Saidthey, "You have had the use ofthe Endowment House for a num-ber of years, and yet nothing hasever been done for us. We laidthe foundation of the governmentyou now enjoy, and we never apos-tatized from it, but we remainedtrue to it and were faithful to God."These were the signers of the De-claration of Independence, and theywaited on me for two days and twonights. I thought it very singular,that notwithstanding so much workhad been done, and yet nothinghad been done for them. Thethought never entered my heart,from the fact, I suppose, that here-tofore our minds were reaching afterour more immediate friends andrelatives. I straightway went intothe baptismal font and called uponbrother McCallister to baptize mefor the signers of the Declarationof Independence, and fifty othereminent men, making one hundredin all, including John Wesley, Col-umbus, and others; I then baptizedhim for every President of the Uni-ted States, except three; and whentheir cause is just, somebody willdo the work for them.I have felt to rejoice exceedinglyin this work of redeeming the dead.I do not wonder at President Youngsaying he felt moved upon to callupon the Latter-day Saints to hurryup the building of these Temples.He felt the importance of the work;but now he has gone, it rests withus to continue it, and God will blessour labors and we will have joytherein. This is a preparation ne-cessary for the second advent of theSavior; and when we shall havebuilt the Temples now contemplated, 
 President Wilford Wooderuff deliveredthe first address at the morning meet-ing.  He said in tracing the history ofthe world we find that God has given tothe sons of men the blessing of thepriesthood.  The people of Israel hadthe first priesthood as well as thoseof later days.  JesusChrist, the greathigh priest, chose his apostles and or-ganized his church.  The apostles anddisciples were put to death for theirfaith, until finally the priesthood camehome to God and remained there fora length of time.In regard to our own day, the eventsprophesied are coming to pass.  "If therevelations of the prophet had notbeen fulfilled," he continued, 'you norI would be here.  Joseph Smith was theprophet chosen by God to organize theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-DaySaints for this dispensation, and thespread of the Gospel has gone on eversince.  Gold, silver and lands may passaway, but the priesthood and salvationnever.  Individuals have come andgone, but the priesthood remains, andwill remain with us until the comingof theSon of Man.  I do not pretend tosay how many we have in our churchtoday, but we know it is flourishinghere and spreading in all parts of theworld.  Man never had a nobler callingthan going out among the people andspreading the gospel of Christ.JOYS OF MISSION WORK."There is no joy greater than to haveyour sons receive the priesthood andgo out among the nations to preachthe gospel.  We have been led here tothese mountains to carry out the willof God.  The blessings we now enjoyare those things which were prophesiedages ago for the latter days."To the young men and young wo-men I would say they must take upthe work of their fathers and mothersand carry on the grand mission.  Tosave one soul is a great thing.  I thankGod I have lived to see these greatmultitudes filling these tabernaclesand temples.  The Lord has been verygood to spare me to this day, and I am thankful for it.  But other nationsare still in the dark.  While the priest-hood remains with us it is our duty tospread the gospel among all the chil-dren of men.  Nothing should deterus from carrying on our missions.  Theevil one has waged war against us fromthe start, but the gospel of Christ hastriumphed, and to the divine help weare indebted for the blessings we en-joy today.  While we have the power ofthe priesthood with us we should doall that we can to correspond with theblessings accorded us.  There is nogreater privilege than to be authorizedto go out among the sons of men andpreach the gospel."I feel today that we can rejoice inthe blessings we enjoy.  People arecoming here by thousands to beholdthe glory of Zion.  The spirit of theworld has changed, and the hands for-merly turned against us are now ex-tended in welcome support.  The timehas come when Zion will go forwardtriumphantly to her glorious destiny.Wherefore I believe we should be thebest people, the most righteous andmost faithful of all the nations of theearth."PRIESTLY COUNCIL IN POLITICS.The First President closed with animportant utterance, albeit it wassomewhat oracular.  He said he hadone thing that he wanted to say on thesubject of giving and taking counsel.The apostles had heard the fear ex-pressed that they were giving toomuch counsel, and various questionswere brought up.  Especially was thesubject of politics discussed.  PresidentWoodruff said every man had the rightto participate in politics and exercise it.People have a right to political as re-ligious beliefs, and no one should in-terfere with them, provided their re-ligion was of the kind taught by Christand countenanced by those in authorityamong the Latter-Day Saints.  Theapostles of the church had beencharged by the Lord with certain du-ties, among them the giving of counsel.There was no man or woman in thechurch who should not take counsel.Those who give counsel are held re-sponsible for it.  If the President shouldgive wrong counsel, God would removehim and put in his place one who wouldgive right counsel, and so with all thosein authority.  If they were unworthythe Lord would not permit them tooccupy high places.  Hence this shouldsuffice, and there should be no dis-quietude on the subject. 
 It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of—a powerwhich records or binds on earth, and binds in heaven. Nevertheless in allages of the world, whenever the Lord has given a dispensation of the Priesthood to any man by actual revelation, or any set of men, this powerhas always been given. Hence, whatsoever those men did in authority, inthe name of the Lord, and did it truly and faithfully, and kept a proper and faithful record of the same, it became a law on earth and in heaven, and could not be annulled, according to the decrees of the great Jehovah. This is a faithful saying! Who can hear it?And again, for the precedent, ##Matthew 16:18-19|Matthew xvi: 18, 19##, "And I say unto thee, that thou art Peter: and upon this rock I will build my church; andthe gates of hell shall not prevail against it; and I will give unto thee thekeys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth,shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shallbe loosed in heaven."Now the great and grand secret of the whole matter, and the summumbonum of the whole subject that is lying before us, consists in obtainingthe powers of the Holy Priesthood. For him to whom these keys aregiven, there is no difficulty in obtaining a knowledge of facts in relationto the salvation of the children of men, both as well for the dead as forthe living.Herein is glory and honor, and immortality and eternal life. The ordin-ance of baptism by water, to be immersed therein in order to answer tothe likeness of the dead, that one principle might accord with the other. To be immersed in the water and come forth out of the water is in thelikeness of the resurrection of the dead in coming forth out of their graves;hence this ordinance was instituted to form a relationship with the ordi-nance of baptism for the dead, being in likeness of the dead.Consequently the baptismal font was instituted as a simile of the grave,and was commanded to be in a place underneath where the living arewont to assemble, to show forth the living and the dead; and that allthings may have their likeness, and that they may accord one with another; that which is earthly conforming to that which is heavenly, asPaul hath declared, ##1 Corinthians 15:46-48|1 Corinthians xv: 46, 47 and 48##."Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural,and afterwards that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth,earthy; the second man is the Lord, from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they alsothat are heavenly." And as are the records on the earth in relation toyour dead, which are truly made out, so also are the records in heaven. This, therefore, is the sealing and binding power, and, in one sense of theword, the keys of the kingdom which consist in the key of knowledge.And now, my dearly beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure youthat these are principles in relation to the dead, and the living, that can-not be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation. For their sal-vation is necessary, and essential to our slavation, as Paul says concerningthe fathers "that they without us cannot be made perfect;" neither canwe without our dead by made perfect.And now, in relation to the baptism for the dead, I will give youanother quotation of Paul, ##1 Corinthians 15:29|1 Corinthians xv: 29##, "Else what shall theydo which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all; why arethey then baptized for the dead?"And again, in connection with this quotation, I will give you a quotationfrom one of the prophets, who had his eye fixed on the restoration of thePriesthood, the glories to be revealed in the last days, and in an especialmanner this most glorious of all subjects belonging to the everlastinggospel, viz., the baptiism for the dead; for Malachi says, ##Malachi 4:5-6|last chapter,verses 5th and 6th##, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet, before thecoming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn the 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.we will then begin to see the neces-sity of building others, for in pro-portion to the dilligence of our laborsin this direction, will we comprehendthe extent of the work to be done,and the present is only a beginning. When the Savior comes, a thousandyears will be devoted to this workof redemption; and Temples willappear all over this land of Joseph,—North and South America—andalso in Europe and elsewhere; andall the descendants of Shem, Ham,and Japheth who received not theGospel in the flesh, must be offi-ciated for in the Temples of God,before the Savior can present thekingdom to the Father, saying, "Itis finished."May God continue to bless us,and guide and direct our labors, ismy prayer, in the name of Jesus.Amen. 
 CONDITION OF THE GERMAN MISSION. 205forbidden to hold meetings of anykind. It has even been declared tous that where seven persons assem-ble together, that number would be considered a metting, and if theparticipants were strangers theywould be expelled, while nativeswould be heavily fined. In theGrand Duchy of Baden the samerule holds. In the kingdom ofWurtemberg, it has never beenforbidden that we hold meetings,but we have as yet no official per-mission to do so. Of course in Switzerland we have full permission.We can hold our meetings in anyhouse. It is not yet allowed us, orin fact any one, to hold open airmeetings. The prospects of themission, as I look at it, are verygood, and I think the day is sooncoming when these rigorous lawswill be broken, whne all those whodesire to serve God in the way that He has commanded, although itmay not be in accordance with the desires of the rules, may have theprivilege. The laws of Bavariapretend to give full freedom of wor-ship ; but the actual fact is, everyperson is prohibited, through pres-sure which is brought to bear uponhim, from attending anything butthe established church, which isCatholic, or the Lutheran. Peopleare expected to attend or at least bemembers of one of these churhces ;and they are compelled to make anofficial acknowledgement of theirbelief in their work books, whichare a sort of credential, containingthe name, age, business, and placeof residence, of every workman inthe country. In this book eachman must announce his religion, and if this happens to be anything but Lutheran or Catholic, he is put togreat trouble and inconvenience,would perhaps find difficulty inobtaining work at all ; and in casehe called himself a " Mormon,"would be punished according to the regulations which some of the States have made. I do not believethat the king of Bavaria, and the rulers of the kingdoms are as bitteras some of the subordiante officials.The strongest persecution we havemet with has been in the city ofNurenburg, and that has been onthe part of the circuit judge, a manwho in other repsects is very liberal,but who mind became prejudicedthrough some false reports whichcame into the country, and werescattered by the press just as wemade a beginning. I neverthelesshope—and I believe it is the generalfeeling—that the day is not fardistant when freedom of worshipwill be allowed—when the Elderscan go through the country andproclaim the Gospel without fear ormolestation. We pray for that day,and have great hopes that there aremany thousands in those countrieswho will receive the Gospel.The Elders are laboring ener-getically. They have spared them-selves no paints to discover those whoare willing to receive their testimony.They are laboring faithfully andwith good results. The emigrationhas been quite extensive, as you know ; but the number of thosebaptized exceeds by a considerableamount the number that haveemigrated. Our branches are therefore growing continually.My brethren and sisters : I amthankful to be able to testify to thetruth of this Gospel, which is beingpreached in these days. I do knowthat Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, and this is a testimony which I have received for myself. It isnot because my parents tought me this, or because I have heard it fromothers ; that has given me courageto bear this testimony before others. 
 heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to theirfathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse." [##Malachi 4:5-6##]I might have rendered a plainer translatin to this, but it is sufficientlyplain to suit my purpose as it stands. It is sufficient to know, in this case,that the earth will be smitten with a curse, unless there is a welding linkof some kind or other, between the fathers and the children, upon somesubject or other, and behold what is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither canthey without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made per-fect, without those who have died in the gospel also; for it is necessary inthe ushering in of the dispensation of the fullness of times; which dispen-sation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfectunion, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, andglories should take place, and be revealed from the days of Adam even tothe present time; and not only this, but those things which never havebeen revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hidfrom the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklingsin this the dispensation of the fullness of times.Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? "A voice of gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out ofthe earth; glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness for the livingand the dead; glad tidings of great joy; how beautiful upon the mountainsare the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things; and they sayunto Zion, behold! thy God reigneth. As the dews of Carmel, so shall theknowledge of God descend upon them."And again, what do we hear? Glad tidings from Cumorah! Moroni, an angel from heaven, declaring the fulfillment of the prophets—the bookto be revealed. A voice of the Lord in the wilderness of Fayette, SenecaCounty, declaring the three witnesses to bear record of the book. Thevoice of Michael on the banks of the Susquehanna, detecting the devilwhen he appeared as an angel of light. The voice of Peter, James, andJohn in the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna County, andColesville, Broome County, on the Susquehanna River, declaring them-selves as possessing the keys of the kingdom, and the dispensation of thefullness of times.And again, the voice of God in the chamber of old father Whitmer, inFayette, Seneca County, and at sundry times, and in divers places throughall the travels and tribulations of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And the voice of Michael, the arch-angel; the voice ofGabriel, and of Raphael, and of divers angels from Michael or Adam, down to the present time, all declaring their dispensation, their rights,their keys, their honors, their majesty and glory, and the power of theirPriesthood; giving line upon line, precept upon precept; here a little, andthere a little—giving us consolation by holding forth that which is to come, confirming our hope. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:19-21##]Resuming, President Woodruff said:—Thus you have before you the subject which is resting upon us, andwhich we wish to present to the Latter-day Saints. Let me say that agehas very little to do with revelation. In the early age of the world, oldfather Adam, three years previous to his death—he being nearly onethousand years of age—called together his posterity in the valley ofAdam-ondi-Ahman, and he stood upon his feet for hours, clothed withthe power of God and the revelations of Heaven, and blessed his posterity,some seven of whom, each representing a generation, were High Priests. Among them were Enoch and Methusaleh, both great men of their dayand generation. He prophesied upon them what should transpire with 
 206 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.But I have felt free in saying to allmen, " Repent and be baptized andyou shall receive the gift of the HolyGhost, and that will give you a testi-mony as it has given it to me."That is the testimony, my brethrenand sisters, that I feel to bear beforeyou this afternoon.I am glad to be once more in thesemoutains, to breathe this air, to seethose with whom I have grown up,and to feel once more at home.During the three years that I havebeen absent, many changes havetaken place, some of them verymournful to me ; but I am thankfulto be back once more. And nowthat I am home, I hope to be ableto work steadfastly in the cause of God, and to do my part in helpingto build up His kingdom upon the earth. This is my desire, and I praythat the Lord will help all of us toremain true to the end in the nameof Jesus Christ. Amen.President Wilford Woodruff thenaddress the congregation. Hesaid : We have been listeningto the testimony of one of our Mormon mountain boys, who hasbeen called in his youth to go forthto the nations of the earth to declarethe Gospel of Jesus Christ to the inhabitants thereof. This is an example of this whole Mormonwork in the day and generation inwhich we live. Joseph Smith himselfwas but a boy, an unlettered youth,when God called him over half acentury ago, to listen to the voice ofthe Lord, and be an instrument inHis hands to lay the foundation ofHis Church and Kingdom on theearth in the last dispensation of the fullness of times ; and from that dayto this men have been called—somefrom the plow, the plane, the ham-mer, and from the various occupa-tions of life—to go forth and life uptheir voices and bear record to thenations of the earth of the Gospelof the Son of God. And the Lordhas manifested His power, and Hismercy to all who have been called togo forth and bear record of Hisname ; and Brother Cannon (JohnQ.) who has addressed us, like tensof thousands of others, can bearrecord before God, angels and men,before the heavens and the earth, tothe truths of the Gospel of JesusChrist, which have been revealedunto us in the day and generationin which we live. It is a marvelouswork and a wonder in the earth, andit is attracting the attention of thewhole human family. The inhab-itants of the earth marbel and won-der, and many times desire to knowwhat the end of these things will be.The lord called upon Joseph Smith,as a literal descendant of Joseph,who was sold into Egppt, to lay thefoundation of the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints.TheChurch had been in the wildernessfor nearly 1800 years. The Churchand Kingdom of God had fallenaway. The Gentiles had followedthe same example of unbelief as didthe Jews when they departed fromthe Gospel of Christ and put todeath almost every man who borethe Holy Priesthood on the earth,or who preached the Gospel of the Son of God to the world. The Jewsrejected the Messiah ; they put Himto death ;and they labored to over-throw the Church, although it wentto them in all the power and glory,and with all the keys, principles,ordiances and priesthood, thatit di to the patriarchs and prophetsin former generations. For this theJews were overthrown. They hadto pay the bill for shedding the blood of the Lord's anointed ; andthe Lord rent the Kingdom out oftheir hands, and gave it into the hands of the Gentiles ; and Paul 
 their posterity unto the end of time. His old age did not have any effectwhatever upon the revelations of God to him. Joseph Smith, when four-teen years of age, while calling upon God in the wilderness, had theheavens opened unto him. Both the Father and the Son presented them-selves unto him in the clouds of heaven, and the Father said, "This is mybeloved Son; hear him."  The age of man is very short indeed in this dayto what it was in ancient days. Men anciently lived to a very great age.When four or five hundred years old they took wives, begat children, andraised up posterity. To-day our age is limited to something like threescore years and ten.I wish to say to the Latter-day Saints that we live in a very importantgeneration. We are blessed with power and authority, holding the Holy Priesthood by the commandment of God, to stand upon the earth and re-deem both the living and the dead. If we did not do it, we should bedamned and cut off from the earth, and the God of Israel would raise upa people who would do it. The Lord would not permit me to occupy thisposition one day of my life, unless I was susceptible to the Holy Spirit andto the revelations of God. It is too late in the day for this Church tostand without revelation. Not only the President of the Church shouldpossess this gift and give it unto the people, but his counselors and theApostles and all men that bear the Holy Priesthood, if they magnify theircalling, should possess that gift for themselves and to assist them in theirduties, although they may not be called to give revelations to lead anddirect the Church. The spirit of revelation belongs to the Priesthood.But to come to the subject before us.  Perhaps it may be said by theinquiring or the objecting mind, What have you to say about redeemingthe dead, or the work of the Temples of our God, that is not already re-vealed? I will say this: When the Prophet Joseph had this revelationfrom heaven, what did he do? There are witnesses here of what he did.He never stopped till he got the fullness of the word of God to him con-cerning the baptism for the dead. But before doing so he went into theMississippi River, and so did I, as well as others, and we each baptized ahundred for the dead, without a man to record a single act that we per-formed. Why did we do it? Because of the feeling of joy that we had, tothink that we in the flesh could stand and redeem our dead. We did notwait to know what the result of this would be, or what the whole of itshould be. Finally the Lord told the Prophet:  "When any of you arebaptized for your dead, let there be a recorder, and let him be eye witnessof your baptisms; let him hear with his ears, that he may testify of atruth, saith the Lord; that in all your recordings it may be recorded inheaven; whatsoever you bind on earth, may be bound in heaven; whatso-ever you loose on earth, may be loosed in heaven."  [##Doctrine and Covenants 127:6-7##] That was the begin-ning of this work.Joseph Smith, instead of living to be nearly a thousand years of age asAdam did, lived to be about thirty-eight years of age. He brought forththe record of the stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim—the history ofthe ancient inhabitants of this continent. By the power of God he trans-lated that, and it has been published in many languages. Besides this, he 
 THE PREISTHOOD MECESSARY. 207the Apostle to the Gentiles, warnedthem strongly and faithfully to takeheed and be cautious lest theyshould fall through the same exam-ple of unbelief. " For if God sparenot the natural branches, take heedlest he also spare not thee." Butall the Prophets and Apostles under-stood by vision and revelation thatthere was to be a falling away. There has been a falling away. I can say of a truth—whether theworld believe it or not—that from the day the spostles and siciplesand those holding the Priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ were put todeath, there has not been a man onthe face of God's footstool who hashad the power to administer theordinances of the Gospel so as tohave power after death. I under-stand perfectly well that world doesnot believe this, nevertheless it istrue. There never was a manbreathed the breath of life in any ageof the world, who had power to goforth and administer the ordiancesof the Gospel of Christ, ouly by thepower of that eternal and everlasting Priesthood which Melchisedek held,which Adam, Abraham, Moses, andElias, and all the ancient Patriarchsand Prophets held. Jesus Christheld it. He was a High Priest afterthe order of Melhisedec, andhas entered into the presence of Godto plead for His brethren. TheApostles held it. No man in anyage of the world had power toadminister the ordiances of theGospel without it. God himself, who has created worlds upon worlds,has created all these worlds and allthose that have been saved have beenredeemed by the power of that eternaland everlasting Priesthood. But asI said before, when the Prophest andApostles and all men who held thePriesthood were put to death, theordiances of the Gospel becamewithout effect, and in consewuenceof this, the whole world has beenfilled with sects and parties, withfalse religions, and principles, untilit would almost appear that there arethe six hundred, three score and six,which John the Revelator saw in his vision. And this has been the con-dition of the whole Christian worldfrom the days of Jesus Christ andHis Apostles until the Lord raisedup Joseph Smith, and commandedhim to organize this church and Kingdom. Did he attempt to do this until he received the Priest-hood? He did not. He did notattempt to administer any one of theordinance until he received theHoly Priesthood from under thehands of the holy men who were sentunto him from God out of heaven.The first man that ordained JosephSmith and Oliver Cowdery to thePriesthood was John the Baptist, who was beheaded from the world ofGod and testimony of Jesus. Thusthey were ordained to the AaronicPriesthood. Joseph afterwardsreceived the Apostleship under the hands of Peter, James and John,who held the keys of the Apostleship.God almighty could not establishHis Kingdom, His Church, His Zion — which the Holy Bible declares from Genesis almost toRevelation should be establishedin the latter days—without menbearing that Priesthood. God hadto raise up such a man as JosephSmith, and establish His Churhc, bu which to prepare a people for thecoming of the Son of man. To this end Joseph was brought forth. He received these oracles from God.He laid the foundation of thisChurch and Kingdom in his boyhood,and he, like the Savior, and many ofGod's other sevants, spent but ashort ime in the flesh after he com-menced his ministry. The Savior. 
 organized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints upon thefoundation of apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus being the chief corner-stone. Men were ordained to the Priesthood and sent forth, from thevarious occupations of life, to carry this Gospel to the world.  God in-formed Joseph Smith that he was called to prune the vineyard once morefor the last time before the coming of the Son of Man.  Since that, thou-sands of Elders of Israel have been sent into the world to preach theGospel. Joseph Smith did all this during the fifteen years he held thePriesthood. Let any man read the revelations in the Book of Doctrineand Covenants, which were given through him during the little time hespent here in the flesh. It is one of the greatest records that any manever gave to the human family. Not only this, but he organized theendowments and did a great deal of other work. Who could expect him,during the short time he lived in the flesh, to do more than he did? Ireceived my endowments from under his hands. He brought forth allthese ordinances that have been given unto the Latter-day Saints. Infact, it is a marvel and a wonder that he performed as much as he did.I want to say, as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that we should now go on and progress. We have not gotthrough revelation. We have not got through the work of God. But atthis period we want to go on and fulfill this commandment of God giventhrough Malachi—that the Lord should send Elijah the prophet, "and heshall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of thechildren to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse." [##Malachi 4:5-6##]Ye sons of men, I say unto you, in the name of Israel's God, those veryprinciples that God has revealed are what have stayed the judgments ofthe Almighty on the earth. Were it not for these principles, you and Iwould not be here to-day. We have had prophets and apostles. PresidentYoung, who followed President Joseph Smith, led us here. He organizedthese Temples and carried out the purposes of his calling and office. Helaid the foundation of this great Temple on this block, as well as others inthe mountains of Israel. What for? That we might carry out these prin-ciples of redemption for the dead. He accomplished all that God requiredat his hands. But he did not receive all the revelations that belong tothis work; neither did President Taylor, nor has Wilford Woodruff. Therewill be no end to this work until it is perfected.-[TO BE CONTINUED.]- 
 lived but three and a half years afterHe entered upon His ministry.Joseph Smith labored in the fleshsome 14 years after the organizationof the Church before he sealed histestimony with his blood, as didother Prophets and Patriarchsbefore him. I say, from that dayuntil this, the Lord has called mento go forth and declare the Gospelof Christ. And Brother John Q.Cannoon has testified, he knows forhimself. Yes, he knows. Thereis no doubt of that. There aretens of thousands of this peoplewho can bear the same testimony.It is true there is a difference withmen with regard to the amoung oftestimony they have received tosatisfy them of the truth of thiswork. Many men believe, but manysay they require a certain amount oftestimony before they know. I willsay for myself: the greatest testi-mony I have ever received in this Church, (and I have spent over 50years of my life in it), has been the testimony of the Holy Ghost, hasbeen the inspiration of the AlmightyGod, has been the spirit of life andsalvation, that still small voice thathas rested upon me and rested uponmy brethren from the time we werebaptized into this Church until thepresent day. We lay hands upon the sick and they are healed by thepower of God. We lay hands upon our brethren, and set them apart for missions. The Spirit of God restsupon us and inspires us in our wordsand thoughts what we should sealupon their heads. These words arefulfilled, and thousands upon thous-ands can testify of the truththereof.The Bible contains a vast amoungof prophecy concerning the lastdispensation and the fullness oftimes; concerning the building upof the Kingdom of God in the last[column break]days; concerning a kingdomo whichshall become an everlasting king-dom, of whose dominion there shallbe no end. God showed this to Daniel and to Nebuchadnezzar, asalso ti Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel.The Prophet Isaiah has portrayedthe whole history of the Latter-daySaints who occupy these mountainsof Israel. He described our travelshere, and our labors since we camehere. These Prophets saw our day,and they spake as they were movedupon by the Holy Ghost; and theprophecies are of no private inter-pretation. Their words are wordsof truth. THeir words have hadtheir fulfillment and will have to theend. The travels of this Churchhave been through deep waters,and this should not be a strangething to the inhabitants of the earth.I will say here, without fear of con-tradiction, that no man, no set ofmen, no people, no ochurch, no por-tion of the Kingdom of God can livegodly in Christ Jesus without suffer-ing persecution. You show me a Patriarch or Prophet that ever livedwho taught the words of life andsalvation without incurring thehatred, the wrath and the indigna-tion of the surrounding nations,and you will show me somethingthat I have not been able to findon the earth. But without dwelling upon this point, allow me to say thatthis is what ails the Mormons. This is the cause of the warfare madeupon us by our nation to-day. GodAlmighty has set His hand to estab-lish His Church and Kingdom onthe earth. He has set His hand togather His people to the mountainsof Israel to build up a Zion. ThatZion is here. We have made abeginning. We came here, on the24th of July, 1847, a little handfulof pioneers. We found a barrendesert. It did not look as if any[page break] 
 DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.-[CONCLUDED FROM PAGE 325.]-I WANT to lay before you what there is for us to do at this present time;and in doing this I desire particularly the attention of President LorenzoSnow, of the Salt Lake Temple; President M. W. Merrill, of the LoganTemple; President J. D. T. McAllister, of the Manti Temple; and Presi-dent D. H. Cannon, of the St. George Temple, and those associated withthem. You have acted up to all the light and knowledge that you havehad; but you have now something more to do than what you have done.We have not fully carried out those principles in fulfillment of the revela-tions of God to us, in sealing the hearts of the fathers to the children andthe children to the fathers. I have not felt satisfied, neither did PresidentTaylor, neither has any man since the Prophet Joseph who has attendedto the ordinance of adoption in the temples of our God.  We have feltthat there was more to be revealed upon this subject than we had received.Revelations were given to us in the St. George Temple, which PresidentYoung presented to the Church of God. Changes were made there, and westill have more changes to make, in order to satisfy our Heavenly Father,satisfy our dead and ourselves. I will tell you what some of them are. Ihave prayed over this matter, and my brethren have. We have felt, asPresident Taylor said, that we have got to have more revelation concerningsealing under the law of adoption. Well, what are these changes? Oneof them is the principle of adoption. In the commencement of adoptingmen and women in the Temple at Nauvoo, a great many persons wereadopted to different men who were not of the lineage of their fathers,and there was a spirit manifested by some in that work that was not ofGod. Men would go out and electioneer and labor with all their power 
 white men could live here. We founda few poor miserable, degradedIndians. They would eat a pint ofcrickets for breakfast and supper,and this, with a few roots, was allthe food they had. To-day, here isa tabernacle. To-day, yuo can travel one thousand miles throughoutthese valleys, from north to south,and you will find them filled withtowns, villages and cities, and yoouwill see temples, tabernacles, etc.What does it mean? It means thatthe God of Heaven is a God of truth. He decreed certain things, and these things are now coming to pass inspiteof all earth and hell. That is whatit means. Had it not been for this,Utah would have been a desert to-day as it was when we found it.The testimony of Elders ofIsrael is true. This is the Gospelof Christ. It is the only Gospel theLord ever revealed to man. And Paul the Apostle says: "Thoughwe or an angel from heaven preachany other Gospel unto you than thatwhich we have preached unto you, let him be accursed." The childrenof men do not believe the Gospel.They will have everything else on theface of the earth except the Gospel.The Lord has set His hand to fulfill His words and promises, and we arehere to help Him in that business.We came here to these mountainsby revelation, by inspiration. Wewere led here by Prophets, Apostlesand inspired men; and this Church and Kingdom has continued to growfroom the day it was organized untilthe present time. It will continueto grow. The Gospel fo Christ is the truth. "Am I therefore becomeyour enemy, because I tell you thetruth," said Paul to the Galatians, in teaching them this principle. But the truth is unpopular. The world isfull of error and falsehood. It will notaccept the plan of life and salvation.[column break]We are in the hands of God. Godhas called us to this labor. He hascommanded us to preach the Gospelto the nations of the earth. This we have done so far as the doorshave been opened to us. It seemsstrange to reflect upon the fact thatsuch nations as Germany, Austria,and Prussia, should put up bars asstrong as iron, so to speak, againstthe preaching of the Gospel of Christin their midst. Still the Lord, as we have heard from Brother John Q.Cannon, is opening up the way.There are a great many of the house of Israel in Germany; there are agreat many of the honest in heartthroughout the nations of the earth,and they must hear the Gospel. Wehave been preachingit for over fiftyyears. The world in a great masure has rejected it. I heard JosephSmith say a great deal in regard tothe attitude this generation wouldassume in regard to the Gospel. Hesaw the situation. Said he: "Theworld will fight you. The worldwill war against you. Towns willaris and mob you, contries willoppose you, cities will oppose you,and the United States will combineagainst you. The world is full ofdarkness. Sin and wickedness isoverwhelming the world as thewaters cover the great deep. Thedevil rules over the world in a greatmeasure. The world will war againstyou; the devil will, earth will, andhell will. But you must bear testi-mony of me. You must preach theGospel, do your duty, and the Lordwill stand by you. Earth and hell shall not prevail against you." "Fearnot them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; butrather fear him which is able to destroy both body and soul in hell."And I would say to our friends, thatis the spirit that vibrates in the bosomsof tens of thousands of Latter-day[page break] 
 to get men adopted to them.  One instance I will name here:  A manwent around Nauvoo asking every man he could, saying, "You come andbe adopted to me, and I shall stand at the head of the kingdom, and youwill be there with me."  Now, what is the truth about this?  Those whowere adopted to that man, if they go with him, will have to go where heis.  He was a participator in that horrible scene—the Mountain Meadowmassacre.  Men have tried to lay that to President Young.  I was withPresident Young when the massacre was first reported to him.  PresidentYoung was perfectly horrified at the recital of it, and wept over it.  Heasked:  "Was there any white man had anything to do with that?"  Thereply was, No; and by the representations then made to him he was mis-informed concerning the whole transaction.  I will say here, and callheaven and earth to witness, that President Young, during his whole life,never was the author of the shedding of the blood of any of the humanfamily; and when the books are opened in the day of judgment thesethings will be proven to heaven and earth.  Perhaps I had not ought toenter into these things, but it came to me.  Men are in danger sometimesin being adopted to others, until they know who they are and what theywill be.  Now, what are the feelings of Israel?  They have felt that theywanted to be adopted to somebody.  President Young was not satisfied inhis mind with regard to the extent of this matter;  President Taylor wasnot. When I went before the Lord to know who I should be adopted to(we were then being adopted to prophets and apostles), the Spirit of Godsaid to me, "Have you not a father, who begot you?"  "Yes, I have.""Then why not honor him?  Why not be adopted to him?"  "Yes," saysI, "that is right." I was adopted to my father, and should have had myfather sealed to his father, and so on back; and the duty that I wantevery man who presides over a temple to see performed from this dayhenceforth and forever, unless the Lord Almighty commands otherwise, is,let every man be adopted to his father.  When a man receives the endow-ments, adopt him to his father; not to Wilford Woodruff, nor to any otherman outside the lineage of his fathers.  That is the will of God to thispeople. I want all men who preside over these temples in these mountainsof Israel to bear this in mind.  What business have I to take away therights of the lineage of any man?  What right has any man to do this?  No;I say let every man be adopted to his father; and then you will do exactlywhat God said when he declared He would send Elijah the prophet inthe last days.  Elijah the prophet appeared unto Joseph Smith and toldhim that the day had come when this principle must be carried out.Joseph Smith did not live long enough to enter any further upon thesethings. His soul was wound up with this work before he was martyredfor the word of God and testimony of Jesus Christ.  He told us thatthere must be a welding link of all dispensations and of the work of Godfrom one generation to another. This was upon his mind more than mostany other subject that was given to him.  In my prayers the Lordrevealed to me that it was my duty to say to all Israel to carry this prin-ciple out, and in fulfillment of that revelation I lay it before this people.I say to all men who are laboring in these temples, carry out this principle, 
 Saints in these mountains. We stand upon this pedestal. This isour platform. What fear have wewith regard to our enemies? Why should we fear? We are in the hands of God. We have come tothis earth in this time upon a mis-sion. We have been born on pur-pose in this generation to take partin this work. The Lord requiredan element to labor with. He will build up Zion. And I bear mytestimony here to all men, and wouldto all the world if I had the power,that the work in which this peopleare engaged, small and insignificantas it may appear, is the work of God.It will roll forth. It will become a mountain. It will fill the whole earth. It will break in peices allother kingdoms, and it will standforever; for God Almighty hasdecreed it. Write it down. Watchthe signs of the times. See if thesethings are not true. We are livingin an important day. We are calledto do a work for the Lord, and weare going to do it as far as we havetime and opportunity. It has costmany men their lives; but men'slives are of little consequence com-pared with eternal life. Give meeternal life. As for this life, whatdoes it amount to. Why should wefear death? Why, bless your souls, a few years ago this nation sacrificeda million of lives in defense of thecountry. That may be all right. Ihave no fault to find. But is it anyworse to die for the Kingdom ofGod than it is to die for the honorof the country? Not much. Thenlet us be faithful. Let us trust inGod. Leave all things in Hishands, and all will be right.Now I would like to say a few words before I close, with regard toour present condition. Of courseour affairs have become a nationalquestion. The eyes of all the world[column break]are looking towards us. But I willsay this: it is a pitiful sight--it is a thing sorrowful to contemplate upon, that our wise Senators, yes, our wiseSenators have to take falsehood intothe halls fo Congress to work uponto overthrow this Church and King-dom: so with the pulpit, so with thepress. Who tells the truth aboutUtah? Not one man in a thousandthat attempts to represent this case.We have not a boy in Utah in ourcommon schools, over twelveyears of age, but knows, when hereads the statements of some ofthose Senators, that they are arguingon a false basis. They understandthat perfectly. I am at the defianceof the world to prove that we use inour common schools anything but thetext books of the world. We don't even use the Bible in our commonschools. To do so would almost betreason in the eyes of our enemies.Yet these venerable Senators repre-sent us as doing this. Why do Senators argue upon false premisesto overthrow this people? If peoplewoudl tell the truth about us, we should be perfectly satisfied. Wehave to be satisfied anyhow.Well, this is the state of the worldtod-say. We are called to preach theGospel. We preach it. There isbut one Gospel. What is it? Faithin the Lord Jesus Christ; repent-ance of sin; baptism for the remissionof sins; and the reception of the HolyGhost by laying on of hands. These are the doctrines Jesustaught, and that His Apostlestaught.I feel to bear my testimony tothese things. They are true. Godis with this people. And we say toour nation--maintain the Constitu-tion and we are satisfied. Give usthe rights of that Constitution andwe are satisfied. It is an instrumentinspired by the power of God. Our[page break] 
 and then we will make one step in advance of what we have had before.Myself and counselors conversed upon this and were agreed upon it, andafterwards we laid it before all the Apostles who were here (two wereabsent—Brothers Thatcher and Lund, the latter being in England), andthe Lord revealed to every one of these men—and they would bear testi-mony to it if they were to speak—that that was the word of the Lord tothem. I never met with anything in my life in this Church that therewas more unity upon than there was upon that principle. They all feelright about it, and that it is our duty. That is one principle that shouldbe carried out from this time henceforth. "But," says one, "suppose wecome along to a man who perhaps is a murderer." Well, if he is a mur-derer, drop him out and connect with the next man beyond him. But theSpirit of God will be with us in this matter. We want the Latter-daySaints from this time to trace their genealogies as far as they can, and tobe sealed to their fathers and mothers. Have children sealed to theirparents, and run this chain through as far as you can get it. When youget to the end, let the last man be adopted to Joseph Smith, who standsat the head of the dispensation. This is the will of the Lord to thispeople, and I think when you come to reflect upon it you will find it tobe true.Another principle connected with this subject I want to talk about. Aman has married a woman, and they have a family of children. The manlays down in death without ever hearing the Gospel. His wife afterwardshears the Gospel and embraces it. She comes to the temple and she wantsto be sealed to her husband, who was a good man. The feeling has beento deny this and to say, "No, he was not in the Church, and you cannotbe sealed to your husband." Many a woman's heart has ached because ofthis, and as a servant of God I have broken that chain a good while ago.I have laid before every woman this principle and let her have her choice.Why deprive a woman of being sealed to her husband because he neverheard the Gospel? What do any of us know with regard to him? Willhe not hear the Gospel and embrace it in the spirit world? Look atJoseph Smith. Not one of Joseph Smith's fathers or brothers or sisterswere in the covenant when he received the keys of the kingdom of Godand translated the Book of Mormon. They afterwards received it. Everybrother and sister that he had, and his father and his father's brothers,except Uncle Jesse Smith, embraced the Gospel. Now, suppose that anyof these had died before they had the opportunity of entering into thecovenant with the Lord through the Gospel, as his brother Alvin did;they would have been in the same position as Alvin, concerning whom theLord, when Joseph saw him in the celestial kingdom, said:All who have died without a knowledge of this Gospel, who would havereceived it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celes-tial kingdom of God; also all that shall die henceforth without a knowl-edge of it, who would have received it with all their hearts, shall be heirsof that kingdom, for I, the Lord, will judge all men according to theirworks, according to the desire of their hearts.So it will be with your fathers. There will be very few, if any, who will 
 forefathers were inspired when theyframed it. Yet it is marvelous to reflect upon some principles thathave been laid down--perhaps Iought not to allude to these things,but I am only expressing my ownreflections--even by the supreme court of the United States. In effectit has said that we may think as weplease, but must not act. I would ask, in the name of the Lord, wasthat all Thomas Jefferson, and othershad in their minds when they framedthe clause in reference to religiousliberty? What about men acting?If it was only inteded that menshould think and not act, why notsay so in the instrument? Whyshould it be stated that "Congressshall make no law respecting anestablishment of religion, or prohibit-ing the free excercise thereof," if menwere not to be allowed to act? Why, in the excercise of their religion, menmust act: and it is straining points,it is overstepping the bounds of theConstitution to pass laws takingaway the rights and privileges of anypeople because of their religion--because they happen to differ fromtheir neighbors. Where will such a course land our government? I will tell you what it will do. It will rendthe government in twain like unto apotter's vessel. It will lay the nationin the dust. It will overhtrow the government. When they get throughwitht he Mormons there will besomebody else to deal with. TheConstitution is good enough for any-body. It is good enough for theLatter-day Saints. We have no principles but what are in accordwith the Constitution of the UnitedStates and the laws of God. We are perfectly willing to trust our-selves and our interests in the handsof God, and to leave our nation inHis hands also; for God will judgeour nation; He will judge us; He[column break]will judge all the children of menand He will judge righteous judg-ment. What men sow they will reap. What measure they mete, it shall be measured to them again.I pray God to bless this nation. I pray God to give our legislators wis-dom, that they may maintain the Con-stitutional principles of the govern-ment, the only government on the face of God's earth where the Lordcould have established His Churchand Kingdom. That we may beprepared to inherit eternal life is myprayer in the name of Jesus.Amen.President John Taylor nextaddressed the congregation. Hesaid: It is some time since I havetaken the privilege to speak to theLatter-day Saints in this place. Ihave been visiting our settlementsin different parts of our Territory.There I frequently talk to the peo-ple. You have a great many herewho are capable of teaching andinstructing you, hence it is veryseldom that I intrude myself uponyou in this capacity. But I always feel pleasure in meeting with theSaints, in hearing my brethrenunfold the principles of eternaltruth, and in listening to the testi-monies which they have to give con-cerning the Gospel of the Son of God.God has revealed unto us the principles of the Everlasting Gospel,and that Gospel brings life and im-mortality to light. Life and immor-tality can only be made known bythe revelations of God, and people who do not believe in revelationcannot have any knowledge of lifeand immortality. It is through thatprinciple alone that these things areor have been developed. We our-selves could have known nothing ofGod from the world in which we live,no from the teachers thereof, be-[page break] 
 not accept the Gospel. Jesus, while His body lay in the tomb, went andand preached to the spirits in prison, who were destroyed in the days ofNoah. After so long an imprisonment, in torment, they doubtless gladlyembraced the Gospel, and if so they will be saved in the kingdom of God.The fathers of this people will embrace the Gospel. It is my duty tohonor my father who begot me in the flesh. It is your duty to dothe same. When you do this, the Spirit of God will be with you. Andwe shall continue this work, the Lord adding light to that which we havealready received. I have had friends adopted to me. We all have, moreor less. But I have had peculiar feelings about it, especially lately. Thereare men in this congregation who wish to be adopted to me. I say tothem to-day, if they can hear me, Go and be adopted to your fathers,and save your fathers, and stand at the head of your father's house, asSaviors upon Mount Zion, and God will bless you in this. This is what Iwant to say, and what I want carried out in our temples.The Almighty is with this people. We shall have all the revelationsthat we will need, if we will do our duty and obey the commandments ofGod. When any of us get so that we cannot receive these revelations theLord will take us out of the way and put someone in our places who can.I am here to-day, on borrowed time, I may say. I would have been inthe spirit world to-day, mingling with the spirits in the presence of God,had it not been for the cry of this people for my life when I lay at thegates of death a year ago. I have been preserved by the power of God.How long I shall live I do not know. It does not make any difference tome. But while I do live I want to do my duty. I want the Latter-daySaints to do their duty. Here is the Holy Priesthood in these mountains.Their responsibility is great and mighty. The eyes of God and all theholy prophets are watching over us. This is the great dispensation thathas been spoken of ever since the world began. We are gathered togetherin these mountains of Israel by the power and commandment of God.We are doing the work of God. This is not our home, as far as mortalityis concerned. We shall soon pass away. But while here let us fill ourmission. I want to say to Brother L. Snow, Brother M. W. Merrill, BrotherJ. D. T. McAllister and Brother D. H. Cannon, and all associated withyou, carry these things before the Lord and see for yourselves. If you arenot satisfied with this order of things, go and ask the Lord about it, andthe Holy Ghost will reveal to you the truth of these principles.This is all I ought to say at this time perhaps upon this subject. I amglad to meet with you. I have had a great anxiety over this matter. Ihave had a great desire that I might live to deliver these principles to theLatter-day Saints, for they are true. They are one step forward in thework of the ministry and in the work of the endowments in these templesof our God. When you get to the last man in the lineage, as I said before,we will adopt that man to the Prophet Joseph and then the Prophet Joseph will take care of himself with regard to where he goes. A manmay say, "I am an Apostle, or I am a High Priest, or I am an Elder inIsrael, and if I am adopted to my father, will it take any honor from me?"I would say not. If Joseph Smith was sealed to his father, with whom 
 cause they do not even profess to beplaced in communion with God, norto have revelation from Him, and how could they speak of that theydid not know or comprehend, or thatwhich had not been communicatedto them? It was impossible forthem to do it. There have beenmany, very many good men in the world in the different ages when theGospel has not existed, that havesought to do good to their fellowmen, and to promote their welfareand happiness in a social, politicaland religious capacity, and havesought to introduce principles thatwould be calculated to elevate andexalt maknind in the scale of being.That is one thing, but the inspira-tion of the Almighty is anotherthing. Let me here mention a prin-ciple associated with these ideas thatwill explain somewhat the remarksand position of our brother, JohnQ. Cannon, who has addressed us thisafternoon. He said he believed inthe principles of the Gospel, but hedid not have a testimony thereof--did not comprehend the thing, untilhe had obtained some further mani-festation. That might be attributedto his youth and inexperience in thethings of God; when he was broughtface to face with actualities oflife, and came in conflict with theworld he was under the necessity ofapplying to His Heavenly Father,who imparted unto him, throughthe Holy Ghost, that knowledge ofwhich he speaks. I will mention aprinciple here. Outside of the Gos-pel, among all classes of men, amongall nations, kindreds and peoples, ofevery color and clime everywhere,they have had given unto them aportion of the Spirit of God to profitwithal. We are told this in the Scriptures, that God has given toevery man a portion of His Spirit; but that is not the gift of the Holy[column break]Ghost. Where good men have fol-lowed the influence of that Spirit,it has led them to do good acts, to be charitable, to be kind, to be benevolent, to cultivate good moralsand correct principles, to be covernedby the principles of honor, truth,integrity and virtue, and theseprinciples prevail to a greater or lessextent among the nationsof the earthand in this nation. This is the por-tion of the Spirit of God, as I saidbefore, which was given to every manto profit withal. Why, those peoplethat we talk about so much some-times, the infidels, they have a por-tion of this Spirit, and many of them do many good acts. This may soundstrange, I have no doubt, to manyof you, but it is a fact nevertheless. He that doeth righteousness any-where is righteous, and he thatdoeth evil is wicked.Now, what is the difference be-tween that and the other principleJesus said when He was upon the earth: "It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;but if I depart, I will send him unto you." What was the Comforter todo? "He shall teach you all things,and bring all things to your remem-brance, whatsoever I have said untoyou." Now, the portion of the Spirit of God which is given to allmen does not do this thing. It doesnot lead them unto all truth, forther eis a great diversity of opinionamong them. One may be a Metho-dist, another a Presbyterian, one aQuaker, another a Dunker, one a Catholic, another a Protestant, one a Christian, another a Mohammedan,one a Pagan, and another an infidel,and some one thing and some an-other. If men were in the possessionof the gift of the Holy Ghost, it would lead them into all truth, andthere would be one Lord, as the[page break] 
 many of you were acquainted, what effect will that have upon his exalta-tion and glory? None at all. Joseph Smith will hold the keys of thisdispensation to the endless ages of eternity. It is the greatest dispensa-tion God ever gave to man, and he was ordained before the world was tostand in the flesh and organize this work. He was martyred for the wordof God and testimony of Jesus, and when he comes in the clouds ofheaven he will wear a martyr's crown. Those of you who stand here—Ido not care whether you are Apostles or what you are—by honoring yourfathers you will not take any honor from your heads; you will hold thekeys of the salvation of your father's house, as Joseph Smith does. Youwill lose nothing by honoring your fathers and redeeming your dead. Itis a glorious work. When I returned from England in 1841 and heardJoseph Smith give this revelation, that we had power to redeem our dead,one of the first things I thought was, "I have a mother in the spirit world."My father was in the flesh. I baptized and ordained him and broughthim up to Zion where he is buried. But I never saw my mother to knowher. She died when I was an infant. I had power to seal my mother tomy father. Was not that a satisfaction? It was to me. I have gone towork with the assistance of my friends and redeemed my father's and my mother's house. When I inquired of the Lord how I could redeem my dead,while I was in St. George, not having any of my family there, the Lord toldme to call upon the Saints in St. George and let them officiate for me inthat temple, and it should be acceptable unto Him. Brother McAllisterand the brethren and sisters there have assisted me in this work, and Ifelt to bless them with every feeling of my heart. This is a revelation tous. We can help one another in these matters, if we have not relativessufficient to carry this on, and it will be acceptable unto the Lord.Brethren and sisters, lay these things to heart. Let us go on with ourrecords, fill them up righteously before the Lord, and carry out this prin-ciple, and the blessings of God will attend us, and those who are redeemedwill bless us in days to come. I pray God that as a people our eyes maybe opened to see, our ears to hear, and our hearts to understand the greatand mighty work that rests upon our shoulders, and that the God ofheaven requires at our hands. Great and glorious are these principleswhich God has revealed to us concerning the redemption of our dead. Itell you when the prophets and apostles go to preach to those who areshut up in prison, and who have not received the Gospel, thousands ofthem will there embrace the Gospel. They know more in that world thanthey do here. I pray God that as a people we may have power to magnifyour callings in this great and mighty dispensation while we dwell in theflesh, that when our work is done we may be satisfied with this life andthis work. This is my prayer and the desire of my heart, in the name ofJesus Christ. Amen. 
 Scriptures say, and one faith and onebaptism. Hence one of the oldProphets, clothed upon by the Spirit of the Living God, looked throughthe vista of future ages and contem-plated events that should transpirein the latter-days, and said: "Whenthe Lrod shall bring again Zion,her watchmen shall see eye to eye."There will be no confusion there,no difference of sentiment there. They will palce themselves under theguidance of the Great Eloheim, and under His inspiration they will beenabled to speak as they are movedupon by the Holy Ghost; and the Sprit of God, as it did formerly,will take of the thigns of God andshew them unto them. There is thedistinction between the two princi-ples.How can we expect that peoplewill comprehend the thigns of Godwithout the gift of the Holy Ghost?The Elders when they are sent forthto preach are instructed to preachnothing but the first principles of the Gospel--to preach nothing butrepentance to this generation. Why?Because the people cannot compre-hend further advanced principles.I remember talking with an eminentclergyman some few years ago. Hewas a very gentlemanly person, welldisposed, intelligent, learned, etc.I talked the Gospel a little to him,but I found he coudl not compre-hend it. Hence I commenced talk-ing politics, history, geography, and some little principles of science.He understood these things perfectly,and we had no difficulty in compre-hending each other; but he couldnot comprehend the Gospel. Washe a minister? Yes; but he hadnot the gift of the Holy Ghost, andit was useless for me to attempt toteach him. This is the way thatI understand these things.Speaking of education, we have[column break]singular notions of education,and some people will say--and Ihave often said it myself--thatJoseph Smith was quite an unedu-cated man. He was uneducatedwhen he was a boy. He was broughtup in the Green Mountains of Ver-mont, and he did not have any ofthe advantages of what we call aneducation. The Lord took him intoHis school, and He taught him thingsthat I have seen puzzle many of thewisest scientists, profoundest think-ers, and the most learned men thatI have met with in this world. Why?Because he was taught of God.What did those principles refer to?To the earth on which we live;to the elements of which it is com-posed; to the heavens above us;to the Gods that exist in the eternalworlds; to the principles by whichthe earth was organized, sustained,upheld and governed, and its rela-tionship to other planets and sys-tems; and speaking of governments,laws and principles, he possessedmore intelligence than ninety-ninehundredths of the people of to-day.And he sought to teach others, andthese things were introduced into the Temple of the Lord inKirtland.I have heard the Prophet Joseph quote from the German Bible insuppot of our method of baptismby immersion, showing that theGerman Translation of the NewTestament favored this idea, andthat the word "Taufen" in thatlanguage means "to dip;" the sameas our term immersion does; andthat when John the Baptist wasspoken of as John the Baptist itwas "Johannes der Taufer," orJohn the Dipper, which is correct.I have heard him quote from the Hebrew Bible in support of a plural-ity of Gods, showing that the suffix"mem" in the word Eloheim or God,[page break] 
 ought to be rendered in the pluraland to read if literally translated, "and the Gods said let us, etc."Certain it is that in our presenttranslatin the word "us" or "letus" indicates that idea; fo "us" iscertainly in the plural and meansmore than one; and while our trans-lation makes it say: "In the be-ginning God created the heavenand the earth," we are also told that"In the beginning was the Word andthe Word was with God, and theWord was God. The same was inthe beginning with God.And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us," and further, that"All things were made by him,"visible and invisible. We are furthertold that "There be that are calledGods, whether in heaven or on earth(as there be gods many, and lordsmany). But to us there is but oneGod, the Father, of whom are all things.'If, as stated, Jesus was with theFather in the beginning, there cer-tainly was more than one God--Godthe Father, and God the Son. Joseph Smith was reasoning uponthis doctrine at the time that he madethis quotation from the HebrewBible.We had a discussion in ths Tabernacle some years ago betweenApostle Orson Pratt and Dr. New-man--the latter a very prominentreligionist from the east--a Metho-dist I think he was--what they calla doctor of divinity. The subjectof discussion was--"Does theBible sanction polygamy?" Mr.Newman was a well-educated man.So was Orson Pratt. Mr. Newmanreceived his education in the schoolsof the day--somewhere in the United States, perhaps in the Methodistorder; but I am not sufficiently acquainted with his history to sayanything about this; I know very[column break]little about Mr. Newman. But Iknow where Orson Pratt got his in-formation. And during this discus-sion some Hebrew points weredebated, and the original Hebrewhad to be referred to. Orson Prattwas quite as well acquainted withHebrew as Mr. Newman was. Wheredid he get his knowledge? He re-ceived it in the Temple at Kirtland,Ohio. In speaking of that principle,the principle of education, to severalleading men only yesterday, I think,I mentioned to them, in alluding tolanguages, that I was a little aston-ished to find that an old gentleman,about 80 years of age, whom I meta short time ago, was thoroughlyconversant with the Hebrew lan-guage. "Where did you learn it?"said I. "Why," said he, "I learnedit in the Temple at Kirtland;" andhe informed me that he was nowstudying Arabic. I was ratheramused at the idea of an old man80 years of age commencing tostudy Arabic. But to return. Ihave seldom met with a man thatwas more intelligent in the scienceof astronomy than Orson Pratt.Where did he get his information?From the same source. He studiedmathematics all his days, and haswritten works that it is very difficultfor some men to comprehend. Yethis works are on record.The religion of God is not a religionof ignorance. To whom are we in-debted for the first principles con-tained in this book [the Bible]? ToMoses. Who was he? A man of God. Who taught him those things? The Lord. By what principle? The principle of revelation; for hecould not know them without.But had he not been taught in theschools of Egypt? Yes. And hadhe not obtained a knowledge ofastronomy in those schools, too? Probably he had in part; but God[page break] 
 taught him the leading, prominentpoints pertaining thereto. And whotaught the Egyptians? Abrahamtaught them the science of astronomy,so we are informed, by late Egyp-tologists, and revealed unto them theprinciple concerning the motions ofthe heavenly bodies. Where didAbraham get his information from?In reading the history pertaining tothis matter we are told that he saysof himself that he was a followerof righteousness; that he sought after more righteousness; that heexamined the history of his fathersand traced back his genealogy to thecommencement of the world, andfrom before the commencement.Afterwards we are told in the samehistory that the Lord gave unto hima Urim and Thummim by whichhe was able to comprehend manythings that others did not under-stand, and by which he obtained aknowledge of the heavenly bodiesand of their motions. Moses wasone of the first to illustrate thisprinciple; but Abraham, who wasbefore Moses, as also Joseph, under-stood it more clearly than Moses.And in those things wherein theworld to-day are puzzled in regardto the Scriptures, and the six daysthat are there spoken of, Abrahamspeaks of thsoe das as times, epochs,or ages, different and distinct fromthe days spoken of by Moses, andhis record agrees precisely with manygeological facts that have puzzled somany of this generation. Wheredid he obtain his knowledge?From God. Who controls theheavens and the earth? The Godsin the eternal worlds. Who hasimplanted certain principles inmatter and in all creation? Godhas done it. All things are subjectto these laws; and if men can placethemselves under His guidance andfind the way to approach the great[column break]Eloheim, they will know more in a very short time than all this worldtogether know in all their lives andmore than all the combined intelli-gence of the world, for God is thefoundation of all wisdom, and the source of all intelligence and knowl-edge. We are told that Solomonwas a wise man. Where did he gethis wisdom? From God. He prayedto the Lord to give him wisdom andthe Lord told him that because hehad sought wisdom he should haveit, and He would also add unto himthe rich treasures of the earth.I speak of these things for the information of the Latter-day Saints,and to disabuse your minds in regardto some of those principles that mensometimes talk about. The worldpossesses a certain amount of knowl-edge and intelligence, and it hasprogressed very rapidly of late years. We have had many discoveries inthe arts and sciences and in theresearches pertaining to geology,chemistry, etc., but many of theirideas and deductions are perfectlyfoolish and rediculous. We havehad the introduction of railroads,gas, steamboats, manifestations ofthe power and use of electricity, etc.Nevertheless, these principles al-ways existed; it needed a develop-ment of them only to bring theminto practical use; and there arethousands of other things not yetmade known, yet to be developed,similar to those that have been dis-covered. In regard to these things,some of them are important, someof them are not very important.The intelligence that the worldboasts so much of, is not very pro-found when you come to test it bythe principles of eternal truth.In regard to the action of theCongress of the United Statess, whichhas been referred to, I want tosay to you Saints, you need not trou-[page break] 
 ble yourselves about it--you neednot be the least concerned about anyof these affairs. But they are actingunlawfully. That is the worse for them. When the Governmentbegins to break down the safeguardsof society, tear in pieces the Con-stitution of the United States, andtrample under foot the liberties ofman, they are only preparing thenation for an utter overthrow. There are plenty of elements of dis-cord and disintegration all around.Congress should not be the first to exhibit examples of lawlessness andthe violation of Constitutional rights.However, if they can stand it we can. We need not trouble our heads about any of these matters; there is an overruling Providence that controlsthe affairs of men and nations. Soyou can rest perfectly easy, youLatter day Saints. We shall con-tinue to do right. We will continueto sustain good principle. And whatwill you do? Just what Jesus said. We will do good for evil. What else?We will pray for them that despite-fully use us and evilly treat us. Why? That we may be the chil-dren of our Heavenly Father, and act on the same principle that Hedoes towards the human family.Does He act in that way? Yes. For he maketh His sun to rise onthe evil and onthe good, and sendethHis rain on the just and on the un-just. He has introduced certain laws into the system of His govern-ment that regulates all things per-taining to these matters. He doesnot make those little divisions thatthe United States are trying to maketo-day. He is more philanthropic.He treats all alike, and places all onthe same basis. Then, we will tryand operate with Him and for Him,and in the interests of humanity,and in the protection of humanrights, and we will try by every legal[column break]and constitutional method to main-tain and sustain the principles ofhuman rights in behalf of ourselves,in behalf of our children, and inbehalf of thousands and tens ofthousands of honorable men thatlive in these United States. Wecan very well afford to abide by theConstitution of the United States, and to sustain it, and we can affordto believe in the Bible and to obeyits ordinances, and practice them,which they cannot do, and do not do.As I have said, we can afford to treatall men well, and to pray for thosewhich despitefully use us and per-secute us. Those who are trying todespoil us are objects more of sym-pathy in my feelings than anythingelse. I feel sorry when I see mis-rule abound anywhere, let it be inthis nation or other nations. Godwould like to see peace, union andharmony. For that reason He hasintroduced the Gospel, and the prin-ciples of intelligence associated withit. Man is a dual being, he possessesa body and a spirit, and is connectedwith time and will exist in eternity,and it is for him to understand thenature of his organism, and hisrelation to the world in which helives, and to God our HeavenlyFather. What, then, will we do?Why, we will try and live for oneanother; we will try and be honest,honorable and virtuous, no matterwhat people can say about us.Concerning the lying about us, weneed not trouble our heads. I donot think we are much better thanJesus was. The people in His daysaid He was possessed of devils, and worse than that, that He cast outdevils by the power of Beelzebub,the prince of devils, and they killedHim saying He was an impostor anda deceiver, and because He said Hewas the Son of God, when they knew He was not. And His theology[page break] 
 was altogether at fault with the learned Rabbis of that day, as oursis with the learned Rabbis of this.We cannot help that. What weknow, as Brother John Q. Cannonhas said, we know for ourselves.We not ask any odds of man. Idon't. I know that God lives; Iknow that He has revealed thetruth; I know this is the everlastinigGospel. I know that you Saints, ifyou are faithful, will secure to your-selves an inheritance in the celestialkingdom of God; but if you are nottrue to God and your religion youwill not. If you go after the thingsof the world and depart from theprinciples of righteousness andtrample upon the principles of honor,virtue, truth, or integrity, you will not enter that kingdom. It is notevery one that saith, Lord, Lord, that shall enter the kingdom of heaven. What shall we do then?We will fear and love God and workrighteousness, and send the Gospelto the nations of the earth, despitethe follies, the wickedness and cor-ruption of men; and we will pro-[column break]claim the truth in these valleys and mountains, and Zion will spread,grow and increase. God will be forIsrael, and we will sing, Hallelujah!the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth, and He will reign until He has putall enemies under His feet. Letthis people fear God and work right-eousness, and I ask no odds of earthor hell. God is at the helm. He will manage things according to thecounsels of His will. He will sayto this nation and to other nations,as He did to the proud waves of theocean, "Hitherto shall thou come,but no further; and here shall thyproud waves be stayed." Our safetyand our defense is in the Lord ofHosts. Let us put our trust in Himand obey His laws, and He will bless and sustain us in time and through-out the eternities that are to come; and we will try and benefit this na-tion all that we can, and all that theywill let us, and if they will not let us, we cannot help it.God bless you and lead you in thepaths of life. Amen. 
 Prest Cannon has read thisFruita.Grand Junction ValleyColorado.Dec 2nd 1897Prest. Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City, Utah.Beloved President.In company with Elder ^H. S.^ Ensign and ^F. C.^ GrahamI came to this city 16 days ago. We have held a seriesof meetings for 13 days, generally in the evening, inFruita and vacinity, to crowded houses, and for the last threenights, have been holding a disscussion with Dr S. P.Green a noted Infidel and gentleman of culture, agraduate of colledge, who pressed me so strongly byletter that I felt I could hardly refuse to accept hischallenge, as it would appear to our many friends thatwe were affraid to have our principles investigated. Iaccordingly felt that the best things to do was to was to accept the gentlemans challenge. I accordingly did so. The Dris very widely known in this valley as a man of good 
 education and ability—the news ^of the debate^ soon spread of  like wild firea large town hall was secured and the anticipated discussionwas known became christened the "Mormon InfidelDiscussion." standing room was at a premium, for isfever you saw a people stirred, as I know you havemany times you can imagine how the people felt hereconducted themselves here—for 10 miles around they came toour meeting: The subject of dis under discussion was:Resolved: that Mormonism was and is founded upon "Myth-historySuperstition and Credulity"—the Dr took the affirmation and Ithe negative.I felt much depended upon the result of the debate and madeit a matter of earnest prayer ^in connection with the brethern,^ and asked our Heavenly fatherto give us success—for we had a great desire to make an opening ^here^The hour arrived to open the discussion, the Dr who hasa splendid Library and is a well had fortified himself witha supply of Anti Mormon literature, opened the discussion byattacking the character of Joseph Smith and rideculed theidea of angels appearing to men, and brought up the Spauldingstory—the Danites, spiritual wife doctrin: the and tried to prove that the prophet was put to death upon this ground by enragedhusbands, who was seeking vengance on the defiler of theirhomes—he brought up affidavids by the dozen—amongsome of which was th contained in the "American Encyclopedia"among many other things, an affidavit from purporting to be sworn to by Orson Hyde and Thomas B. Marsh 
 he tried to ^bring testimony that would^ Invalidate the Testimony of the "ThreeWitnesses and the Eight Witnesses and he brought upmore infernal lies to support his side of the question than Isupposed was in existance, he closed his remarks invokeing theThunderbolts of Heaven to strike every man who followed in theexample taught by Joseph Smith and burn them to ashes &c &c(the same was repeated by the Dr every night, with no newarguments:)I arouse ^arose^ to my feet asked the faith and prayer's of the people,and proceeded carefully to dispel the flood of lies, fortunatelyI had with me the "Myth of Manuscript Found" by Geo Reynolds"The Manuscript Found," Edward Stevenson's pamphlet" andothers books, as the peo[p] arguments of the Dr began todissapear one by one the people began to see the truth andthey were truly astonished to hear the proofs we had tosupport our position. I read Josephes account of his visionthe Three Witnesses individual testimony &c, &c, and woundup by bearing Testimony to the Devine Mission of theProphet and the brethern sang We thank thee O, God for aProphet—the next night was spent in simelar argumentsThe last night the Dr attack me very savagely uponPolygamy, and when I bringing up the most Damnible hearsays that mortal man ever listened to; and called upon me in thename of God to know if I had the termerity to palliate oradvocate, this damnable doctrin of Devils in this advanced—over— 
 day of advanced civilization &c.The people There was a breathless silence as I arose tomy feet and the people was doubtful as to my ability to sustain the Doctrin of Polygamy for up to this time I had avoided thequestion, purposely as I had an hour's time the last nightand did not wish to go into the subject until I coulddo it Justice for so I was prompted by the spirit of theLord—Oor our Heavenly Father put his spirit upon melike a fire, for the young brethern was behind me prayingunto God to give us success and truly our prayers wereanswered: for as soon as I arose to my feet I feltprompted to engage in a little humor until I got thepeople to roaring, then when I saw their feelings mellowedI felt prompted to say: There is a great drouth of presciseinformation regarding the views of the Latter Day Saints regardingthe question of Polygamy and I deem it my duty to take up thequestion and treat upon it inasmuch as I had been attact bythe Dr my opponent: I announced, we beleived the principal ofPolyamy to be a correct one under proper regulations but was not at present advocateing its practice &c I told them no mancould be a christian and not beleive in Polygamy—That noman could go into the Kingdom of God who did not beleivein Polyamy—That Jesus was from a Polygamousstock that if they beleived in Christ they must acceptthe doctrin of Polygamy or reject them both. 
 I have been blessed of the Lord many times but neverat any time did the Power of God rest upon me toa greater extent I showed up the fulfillment of thepromise of the Lord to our Father Abraham and I tracedup his lineage down to Christ showing the redeemer tohave fulfilled that great promise. I finally gotAbraham, Isaac and Jacob ^and their desendants^ in the City of the NewJerusalem and the whoremongers, seducers, dogs, andliars and Dr Green on the outside: our cause wasgained—God gave us a great victory—Hail tothe Prophet was sung by the power of God bythe young brethern—The people thronged aroundus, with compliments, God speed you, come and seeus, and hand shakeing with the people was theonly way to get out of the house—Truly man isnothing without the spirit of God.Eight people have applied for baptism, and many friends are investigateing—we sold all the books wehad—which was two dozen Voice Warning, and gave themall a tract, and we hope all will be overruled for good, andwe The E feel that our Father has heard our prayers for when we first came into the valley we knelt downarddedicated our selves unto him and prayed earnestlyfor success—and we feel like lifting up our 
 6voices in praise and thanksgiveing to God for his careover usAbout sixteen ^applications for^ baptisms are reported from the several fields—6 in Fort Collins—8 in ColoradoSprings—and two in Pueblo—also the 8 here—The missionaries are all well, and everything seemesin a prosperous condition.This is a very fruitful valley—we wont need to bring settlers in here to colonize East of here as wewill, with the blessings of the Lord have more peoplehere than will be needed in a few monthsI leave in company with Elders Ensign and Grahamfor Walsenberg to night where we will hold meetingsfor 12 days.

Amen and Amen.May the 1st Mrs Woodruff with myself removedour boarding place to Elder W. Parrish's and on the25th of the same month we commenced boarding withElder Jonathan H. HaleSunday the 28th I repared to the Houseof the Lord to worship with the congregation of theSaints. The spirit of murmering and rebellionof which I have already spoken in a former pagehad not slept but had been brewing in the familycircle in the secret chamber and in the street untilmany and some in high places had risen upagainst Joseph who^m^ God raised up to lead Israeland they were striving to overthrow his influence andcast him down. This grieved the spirit of theProphet to find such perils among false brethren 
 But notwithstanding this thick cloud of darkness impendingover Kirtland Joseph being unmoved in the cause entered thecongregation of the Saints and arose and spoke to the people inthe name of the Lord in his own defence. The Lord was withhim by his power and spirit to the convincing of the honestthat he would stand and his enemies fall. Sidney followedwith an able discourse and several others maintained Josephin his integrity. But alas one arose once a friend but now inhis darkness he stretched out his puny arm and proclaimed againstthe Lord's An^n^ointed but Joseph acted wisely while all saw thespirit of his foe.I spent the evening of the 30th in preparingmyself to go forth on a mission to the eastern country toagain proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ in company withseveral of the brethren.Having reached to this period of my history Iwill close Chapter IX and commence a new one with mymission to Canada and the Islands of the sea.[FIGURE]CHAPTER X.[six lines blank]May 31st arrived; and the time had come forme to take the hands of the Saints in Kirtland in parting fromthem to go into the vin^e^yard to proclaim the word of God. Iaccordingly took my farewell of Mrs Woodruff my companionand sister Hale who were expecting to tarry together for a season. I then left Kirtland in good spirits in companyof Elder Hale and having walked to Fairport a distance of 
 twelve miles I took the steamboat Sandusky with EldersJ. H. Hale and Milton Holmes at 12 o'clock at nightWe reached Buffalo at 6 o'clock on the morningof June 1st. We then went on board the Indiana andsa^i^led to Syracuse which we reached on the thirdThe next day which was Sunday wewalked from Syracuse to Richland Oswego Co. N. Y.where I was again blessed with the privilege of takingby the hand my brethren after the flesh—namely,Azmon and Thompson Woodruff. I had not seeneither of them for three years. I found my cousinElad ^Eldad^ Woodruff with them.There was something of a coldnessmanifested by my family relatives towards myselfand the two brethren in the Church who accompaniedme. This was because of our religion and This coldnesswas especially shown by Elizabeth my brother's wifeNotwithstanding that it was againstthe principles of my brother's family to receive us forthe night we were permitted to sup with them andone of my former neighbours Mr Walter Menter gaveus a place to lay our heads for the night which wegladly accepted.I called in the morning at my brotherAzmon's and conversed with him and also my brotherThompson upon temporal and spiritual subjects. Neitherof them manifested any hardness towards me in themorning but both appeared affected. Brother Azmonsaid he was still seeking for light and truth and shouldnot have left the Church of Latter-day Saints had it notbeen for his trials and temptations &c.Having commended them to God I took theparting hand of my brethren and their household feelingperhaps that it might be the last time that I should seethem in the flesh. I left with some painful sensationsand a firm belief that there would be some change in theirhousehold which presentiment I expressed to my brotherAzmon. In my heart I prayed the Lord's mercy uponmy brethren—kinsmen after the flesh but I ^could^ not sayas I left the threshold of his house the peace and 
 1854-1858 
 blessing of God I leave with you which I ^as I could^ have done had webeen received in the name of the Lord. We then walked tosister Calvins and Elder ^Duchers^ in Jefferson's county being a distanceof 24 miles during the day.On the morrow we travelled to sacketts Harborur^&^ visited the American Garrison which was beautiful for situationWe also had an interview with brother Archibal Patten. At10 o'clock at night we took passage on board the Oneida atSacketts Harbour and crossed Lake Ontario to Kingston in theprovince of Uper CanadaI was now in the dominions of Great Britainand this was the first time that I ever trod the soil of theBritish Soverign. After spending several hours in Kingston wewalked to Kingston Mills on the morning of the 7th; and spentthe night there.We took the steamboat June the 8th at 8 o'clocka.m. at Kingston Mills to go up the canal. We passed through aswamp of about twelve miles in length which abounded with^fir & such as muskrat otter beaver &c.^From Brewer's Mills we passed through CrambaryMarsh to Jones' Falls where the boat passed through four lockswhich were built by the British Government and supposed tobe the most splendid works of the kind in America. Theycost four hundred thousand dollars being one hundred thousandeach. Yet notwithstanding these magnificient works theface of the country presented a scene of the most gloomyaspect; it being a rocky hilly barren uncultivated countryWe left the boat at the locks and walked tobrother A^rtemus^ Judd's in the township of Bastard LeedsCounty Upper Canada where we were joyfully receivedby the Saints of God. They had been brought into theChurch through the instrumentality of Elders J. E. Page and J.Blacksley and we were much rejoiced to hear of the work ofGod prospering in their hands.The 9th was spent in writing and on thefollowing day we attended Conference with Elders John E Pageand James Blakesley at the township of Bastard.The Conference consisted of 13 Elders 5 Priests8 Teachers and 6 Deacons besides a large congregationof Saints. 
 I was called upon to open the meeting by prayer. Theconference then proceeded to business.There were eight Branches of the Church representedconsisting of 300 members in all. Thirty two brethren werepresented for ordination and Elder William Draper and myselfwere called upon to ordain them. We then ordained 7 Elders 9 Priests 11 Teachers and 5 Deacons. This withsome other matters filled up the business of the day.Meeting then closed and I accompanied several brethren toElder Stodard's where we spent the day ^night^.The conference was continued on the nextday and I was called upon to address the congregationin the morning service. It was with peculiar feelingsthat I arose to address a large body of Saints in thecapacity of Conference raised up in another nation seperatefrom my own and under another Government. Thiswas the first time that I had ever addressed a congregationof Saints under the British rule. I preachedfrom the ##2Corinthians 4:3-4|2nd Cor. IV, ch 3rd & 4th## verses.The Spirit of the Lord was with us andwe were blessed. After I closed the Saints spake intongues and prophesied. Five presented themselves forbaptism which was administered unto them by ElderPage thus was added others to our number.After an intermission Elder Page addressedus upon the Priesthood and bore a strong testimony tothe people. Our Conference then closed by our returningthanks to God.We took the parting hand of many brethrenand sisters and I returned with several Elders to brotherStodard's to spend the night.At his house there was a woman presentedwho was often possessed with the devil. She was oft timesdumb and greatly afflicted by evil spirits that dwelt in her.She beleived in Jesus Christ of Nazareth and in us as his servantsand called upon us to cast the devil out of her.According to this woman's request four ofus laid our hands upon her and commanded the devilin the name of Jesus Christ to depart out of her andit was immediately done. The woman arose with great 
 joy and gave thanks and praise unto God; for according to herfaith she was made whole from that hour. A child also that was sickwas made whole by the laying on of hands in the name of Jesusaccording to the words of the Lord. See ##Mark 16:17|Mark 16 ch, 17th verse##.On the 12th I parted from Elders Page and Blakesley andmany other Saints and traveled in company of six other brethen tothe Branch of the Church in Leeds.We met together in the evening at brother Carnes' topresent ourselves before the Lord and b^e^are testimony of his work. EldersJohn Go^o^dson H Hale M. Holmes and John Snider followed eachother in testimony and I testified next. The Spirit of God restedupon us all.I called upon sister Carnes to present before the Lord twoof her children who were sick, that we might administer unto themOne was a sucking child and lay at the point of death. I took it inmy arms and presented it before the Elders who laid their hands uponit while in my arms and we healed it in the name of Jesus ChristI then returned it whole to its mother. The other child wasalso healed; and the parents praised God for his goodness. Ispent the night at brother Eetons.On the following day I jorneourneyed to KingstonUpper Canada with several of the Elders and on the next went onboard the Great Britian. We reached Oswego at 7 pm. TheGreat Britian was at this time the largest steam ship in theworld and the boast of the English people. We continued ourjourney in the line boat Maumee. At Syracuse we wenton board the Saint Joseph and on the 16th we reached Uticaand thence started in a rail car to Schenectady. Here weparted from Elder John Go^o^dson and Priests Isaac Russel andJohn Snider. These brethren who had journeyed with us fromCanada were bound for the city of New York to join two of theTwelve who were to start for England on the 20th of June 1837to carry glad tidings of salvation to the inhabitants of Europe. Thetwo of the Twelve refered to is Heber C. Kimble and Orson HydeThey were first chosen to open the kingdom of God in Englandand five others of the brethren were to accompany themWe continued our journey five miles after partingfrom the brethren; and the next day travelled 33 miles more;and on the one following reached Canaan Litchfield Co. ConnecticutI was delighted once more to set foot upon the soil of my native 
 State and to strike hands with one of the Elders of Israel raisedup in this district—namely, Elder Gibson Smith who was presidingover the Canaan Branch. He received us kindly and badeus welcome. A meeting was appointed and I preached to thepeople in the Academy who listened with most silent attentionThis day we had walked 33 miles.On the morrow we walked to Mr Jesse Moseswhere we found Priest Julian Moses and a number ofbrethren and sisters and we rejoiced together. I spent thenight at brother Francis K Benedict's and was informed thatmy father Aphek Woodruff had moved from Colebrook toFarmington his former place of residence.I walked in company of brother Benedict junon the 22nd to Beach Hill in Colebrook Lichfeld Co. ConnecticutHere I had the happy privilege of again embracing mysister Eunice Woodruff. It was five years since welast parted from each other. I found my sister teachingschool in the Rock School house.After the interview of our first meetingand dinner with my sister was over Eunice and I visitedthe Stillman neighbourhood in order to find Elder Dexter Stillman from thence together we walked to Mr DanielNorton's in New Marlborough Berkshire Co Mass and thenceto father Benedict's. The whole distance of the daywas forty miles.The 23 was spent in writing and on thenext day, Saturday, we met in Conference at Mr Jesse Moses inCanaan. The conference was composed of 5 Elders and twomore were ordained during the day. On the Sundaythe Conference was continued when we had much liberty inspeaking to the people. After meeting Elders Milton Holmesand J. Moses started on a mission to the town of Mansfied.On the 28 I again visited Rock Schoolhouse in Colebrook with Elder Hale. Here I found mysister Eunice still employed teaching school. After ashort interview with Mr Alpha Sage I spend the remainderof the day with Eunice whom I accompanied to herschool and spent a very interesting time. As the sceneand reflections of the time affected me much as well as 
 interesting me with the associations of home and family recolectionsI will here give from my journal a discription written at the time ofMy Sister EuniceTeaching School.I entered the school taught by my Sister Eunice at 1 o'clocka^p^.m. Five hours I spent within its walls watching my sisterin the performance of her school duties and in perusing letters writtento her by my brother Asahel. Five years before when I lastbeheld Eunice at our father's house she was only a child of twelveyears of age; but in the scene before me I now beheld her aninstructoress of youth. As I looked up^on^ her—my only sisterteaching the youth and showing accomplishments that grace the femalesex varied reflections passed through my mind and emotion of strongaffection moved me. There she appeared before me (only seventeenyears of age) adorned with youth modesty and lovelinessWith a degree of admiration I gazed upon her and marked thechange five years had brought upon her ^produced^. Her spirit was ^blythe^ blithfuland her step as she moved among her pupils showed the energyof youthAs if to call my mind more perfectly to therecollections of home and past scenes Eunice with a cheerful gracepresented me with the bundle of letters from our brother AsahelThey were fifteen in number and addressed to my sister. AsI read them through they filled my soul with emotion and broughtas great a variety of feelings as the matter they contained. Theyshowed the cultivated mind and refined talents of a brother writingto a sister with the purest spirit and deepest feeling for herwelfare. Such teachings as those to Eunice if followed bythe female youth would lead them by a thousand snares. Thename of Wilford was mentioned often. As I read I smiled andwept & in my heart said O God protect my brothers my sistermy wife and my parents.I left the School with my sister and togetherwe viewed the Colebrook landscapes as we walked along and conversed 
 of our brother Asahel and of home and childhood's days.Together we visited our parents' dwelling at Sage Mills butthey had gone to Farmington. Stumps and stones and houseand all looked natural. I went into the house but noparent or brother was there but all was as silent as death^I dropped a tear^ and Eunice plucked a rose as we leftFrom thence we went to Jonathan Stillmanswhere we took supper after which Eunice and I partedfor the time and in company of brothers Hale and Dexter Stillman I preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the schoolhouse in the evening and bore testimony unto the truthof the Book of Mormon.The next day I preached in a Methodistmeeting house and on the following one had an interviewwith a Methodist priest who said that God had neitherbody parts nor passions and that it was rediculous toworship one who had. I continued preaching &c duringthe three succeeding days but nothing occurred that wouldbe interesting here.On Indipendence day July 4th I rode toColebrook post office and to visit sister Eunice. At the postoffice directed to my father and sister I found two papersfrom brother Asahel but no letters. Eunice had joineda party to sail on the ^Doolittles^ pond. On my returnhome I saw them cross the pond in the boat. I raised aflag in token of friendship and they answered but did not knowme and as they passed my sight behind a grove I bowedto them in silence and said to myself God save my sisterWith brother Hale I took stage to NewHartford and from thence went to Avon and spent the night ataunt Helen Wheelers and visited my friends and kinsmen inthe place.The Place of My NativityThe six^th^ of July was a day of great interest tome. After visiting Daniel, Luther, and many in Avon I leftAunt Wheelers and walked with Elder Hale on the canal touncle ^Adna^ H^art^s from thence to Woodford Mills builtand formerly owned by my father Aphek Woodruff. Here I was 
 born and here I spent my youth.After viewing the Mills I went to the house whereI was born and visited each appartment. The house and farm alllooked natural ^Bogue Hill^ not excepted. I called at Mr Henry Woodruff's^ford^and saw Mrs Woodford. I also called upon Mr Judds Mrs Allens ^Z^and O Harts. At Roger Woodfords I saw Eldad W. and Lavilla Day.I visited uncle Titus Woodruff's family and saw Caltha Herd at theirhouse. I called upon Capt Francis Woodruff Erastus Woodruff and Adnaand C. [&c] ^Woodruff^ who were all glad to see me. I also visited uncleOzem Woodruff's family. He was absent. I also saw many other friends.During the walk I passed the school house in which I spent many ofmy youthful days. I gazed upon it and upon the graveyard whereslept many of my progenators and friends. There was reposing alsothe remains of my mother. I read the inscription on their toombstonesof several numbered with the dead who were well when I leftConnecticut in 1832. On the toombstone of my mother wasthe following inscription:A pleasing form a generous gentle heartA good companion just without artJust in her dealings faithful to her friendsBeloved through life lamented in the end.My mother Bulah Thompson Woodruff was born in 1782and died June the 11th 1808 aged 26 years. She was marriedto my father Nov 29 1801 and by him had three children—namely, Azmon born Nov 29th 1802; Ozem Thompson born Dec22nd 1804; and Wilford born March 1st 1807My father afterwards married Azubah Hart by whomhe had six children five sons and one daughter, my sister Eunice.After spending most of the day in visiting the beforementioned friends I walked from Ozem Woodruff's to Farmingtonto again visit my parents who had moved from Colebrook a fewdays previous to their former place of residence.I arrived at my father's house at the setting ofthe sun, where I was once more blessed with the happy privilegeof taking again my parents by the hand and of beholding themface to face after being seperated from them over five yearsI was joyfully received and made heartily welcomeI visited the Mills where I had spent several years and passed the night 
 The next day was spent at my father's in writing tobrother Asahel and on the following day I walked to Avon andvisited uncle Thadeus Thompson, Grandmother Thompson andher household and many other relatives and neighbours all ofwhom manifested pleasure in seeing me. The night was spentat uncle Titus Woodruffs.Sunday the 9th I went to uncle Ozem Woodruff andfound him at home. It was with much pleasure that Imet this dear old friend who hast oft led me by the handin youth and taught me the gifts and graces of the ChurchI also visited other relatives and friends and at night preachedat the school house to a congregation of them. They gavegreat attention and treated me with kindness and the Spiritof God rested upon usOn the morrow Elder Hale and myself went toCollensville w[h]ere uncle Ozem was assisting in building astone dam across the river. There I visited a grove whereI had often retired in 1830 for prayer and meditation. Ihad here many interesting seasons by day and by night whiletending the mill for Collens in 1830. In this pine groveI spent three hours in reading the Book of Mormon andin prayerAt six o'clock p.m. I met at the city hall atCollensville for the purpose of preaching the Gospel to thepeople. Immediately after I arose and commenced speakingdrums were heard at the door and laughing and sneering wereprovoked in the congregation. The Presbyterian priest wasenraged against the truth and as soon as I closed he hurried himselfto the place where I stood and I was immediately surrounded bythe congregation. The priest said I had no right to enjoy myopinion and he became angry and said many very inconsistantthings. The priest and people with very few exceptions rejected ourtestimony. Afterwards brother Hale uncle Ozem and myself repairedto the grove for prayer where we had a good timeThe next evening I preached at Lovely Street Schoolhouse upon the authenticity of the Book of Mormon and the peoplegave good attention. I spent the night at uncle Ozem's and weconversed upon the things of the kingdom until the following dayAt 2 o'clock on the morning of the 12th uncle Ozem and his family 
 January 1854January the 1st 1854 came on a Sunday. I attended at the TabernacleThe people were addressed in an interesting discourse by Orson Hyde. In the afternoonby Elder Wilford Woodruff who was followed by President Brigham YoungNext day the new year was celebrated by the usualsocial manner. I delivered an address to the inhabitants of the FourteenthWard in the forepart of the day and was followed by several othersIn the evening I attended a party at the Social Hall. Thetime was mostly spent in music and dancing. We had however aninteresting address from President Brigham Young onDancing and Music"I consider this a suitable place to give some instruction. We haveassembled here to have music and dancing. The world have had very strangeideas concerning these things. They have supposed it was very wickedfor a Christian to dance or hear music. Many preachers of the dayhave said that fidling and music came from hell; but I say there isno fiddleing inor music in hell. There is not a fiddler in hellnor any music of any kind. Music belongs to heaven tocheer God angels and men. If we could hear the music thereis in heaven it would overwhelm mortal manThe Lord gave us that organ that makesmusic so delightful to man and the Devil has stolen music andmany other things that was ordained of God for the benefit of manand he has turned it to an evil use; but music and dancingis for the benefit of the holy ones and if those who come here tonight are not holy and righteous and do not feel to worship andpraise God they have no business hereWhat strange ideas the world have of a ProphetThey would expect to see a man with finger nails a foot longwith his hair hanging to his hips his body covered with dirt andfilth his head bowed down ^in sorrow^ for the sins of the world and that 
 household beleived in the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel and at thesame hour I led them forth and pbaptized them for the remissionof their sins. There were three of them namely, my uncle and hiswife Hannah and their son John. This was a fulfilment of a visiongiven to me in 1818.After baptizing them I walked in company of ElderHale to Simsbury to visit aunt Cossetts household and was glad tobehold them face to face and to teach them the things of the kingdomAnd On the next day I parted from her and other relatives visited othersin Avon and rode to Farmington to my father's where I found a letterfrom my wife Phebe in which she gave me the information that shewas on her way to Farmington.On the Sunday following I had the happy privilege ofmeeting my wife. She came to attend our meeting at Adna Harts inAvon. My stepmother and Eunice accompanied her. At 5 p.m. Ipreached to a congregation of relatives neighbours and former friends andthen returned to my father's at FarmingtonI bid adieu to my father and mother on the 20thand also my sister Eunice. I then took stage with my wife androde with her to Hartford a distance of ten miles. She continuedher journey to her father's in Maine by stage while I persuedit on foot. The reason why I did not go farther with herby stage will be easily understood by those who are acquaintedwith the history of the first Elders of the Church who like theApostles of old travelled and preached without purse or scriptI had only sufficient money to pay my wife's fare and thus it wasthat she continued her journey from Hartford per stage whileI did it on foot.During the next three days I walked 136 miles. On the first I walked 52and on the second 48 leaving 36 for the third day which I accomplishedby about 5 o'clock in the afternoon.Here I will briefly relate an incident of my second day'stravel. Within a mile or two of [blank] I felt so weary and wornout that ever^y^ step was made with painful effort. Just then agentleman came dashing along swiftly in his carriage. As hewas passing I prayed that he might be moved upon to take me upThe horse shot by me with swiftness to the distance of ^10 rods^and then stop^p^ed and seemingly of his own accord as suddenly as though 
 he would not have a house or lie in one nor in a bed but in the caves of the rocks and on the ground and must never smile or appear happy. And as to seeing an Apostle the people would expect to melt if one came along. But all of these ideas are vain and foolish; for this company before me to night does not begin to be adorned inside or out as they should be in order to meet with the angels ofin heaven who are adorned in purity power and glory clothed with clean white linenI will say a word concerning dancing with the Gentiles. As I have got up this party if I had felt disposed to have invited some Gentiles here would they have contaminated me or this company? No; because the Priesthood rules here with the keys of power truth light and knowledge; and I would not suffer anything that is wrong for I would control things and have them my own way or break up the party. But if any Elder in this Church was to follow after Gentile parties they would submit themselves to their spirit partake of their evils and go to the devil. Any Elder would fall who pursued this courseWhy do not the Gentile merchants of this City embrace this work? Because they have locked bolted and bar[r]ed their minds against it with every lock they could put on. They swore by every power they possess before they left home that they would not embrace it. They came with but one object and that was to gain money and they are determined not to be turned from their purpose."Many other excellent remarks were made by President Young.Sunday the 22nd I preached in the morningfrom the text, Whatsoever ye sow that shall ye also reap. [##Doctrine and Covenants 6:33##] In the afternoon President Young preached and I reported his sermonAt the close of the meeting I went in company with President Young to see President Willard Richards who was very sick with the palsy. He was in a dreatful spasm lying upon the floor with seven men trying to hold him.

 some barrier was in his path while the gentleman impelled bythe same power turned to me and sung out to ask if I would rideOf course I answered in the affirmativeOn the third day I arrived at New Rowley, Essex Co., Mass.,where I was joyfully received by the parents of Elders Jonathan and Milton Holmes. Here I found their son Milton brother Hale and my wifePhebe whom I was rejoiced to again meet.Nine days later, August 1st I left the friends in New Rowleyand journied with Elder Hale towards my father-in-law's in the stateof Main which I reached on the 8th.Soon after my arrival at bro E Milliken Elder MiltonHolmes also arrived bringing my wife with him. After dinner Irode with Phebe to her father's, Mr. Ezra Carter. This was the firsttime I ever saw any of my wife's family. It had been about oneyear since Phebe left her father's house to go to KirtlandWhen we arrived at the house we found Phebe's fatherabsent and her mother confined to a bed of sickness: she had beenvery low but was fast recovering. One of my wife's brothers wasat home and all her sisters. Two of her brothers were absent. It was an affecting meeting and we were both joyfully received andmade welcome. During the evening father Carter came home & we all rejoiced exceedinglyIn company with Ezra and F^abyan^ Carter I wentout in a fishing boat on the 11th. We spent the day and nightat anchor and caught 250 fish such as cod haddock hake &cI also saw four whales. Two of them appeared in view at the same time. This was the first time I ever saw a whaleOn the 18th I took the parting hand of my friendsin Scarborough and leaving my wife at her father's I started withElder Hale to visit the Islands of the sea to preach the Gospel to thosewho trade in ships. We arrived at Portland in the evening where ^I^ sawmy brother-in-law Ezra Carter. The population of the place was about 16,000. The next day we took steam boat for the Islands calledFox Islands where after changing boats once we arrived at 2 o'clock inthe morning.Having landed we called at Nathaniel Dyers and retiredto rest. When we arose we made ourselves known as servants of God andenquired concerning religious meetings in the place. It was the Sabbathday and we learned that there was to be preaching in the Baptist meeting house in the centre of the North Island which was part of Vinal Haven. 
 he suffered immensely and it seemed as though he was struggling in the agonies of death. He had been sick several days. I spent the night with him He suffered much during the night. The Presidency and Twelve administered to him by the laying on of hands. We were almost fearful that he would not recover from this sickness still we hoped.I returned home in the morning, and Dr Richards continued failing during the weekOn the Sunday I attended with Dr Richards in the forepart of the day. He suffered much. At the close of the afternoon's meeting the Presidency and Twelve went to Dr Richards and administered to him by the laying on iof hands and we had done it frequently and had sometimes hopes of his recovery but all outward appearences had been against he'is getting up again.After the evening's Ward meeting I went to Dr Richard's and spent two hours with him. He was very low and to all appearence would not live until the morning, but the next morning he was alive and appeared somewhat better.Next day also Dr Richards still lived and continued better and there were many reasons to desire his recovery and to expect it principally because the Twelve had administered to him many times and exercized their power and faith in his behalfI attended the Bishops meeting in the evening with Elder Thomas Kington. I addressed the Bishops and had the Spirit of the Lord. We were now beginning to ordain our young sons to the lesser Priesthood here in ZionWe were gathering all our young children from eight years old and upward in the several Wards, one evening in each ^week^ Ward  for the purpose of speaking and praying. I met with the children in the Fourteenth Ward this evening and addressed them. I had some fifty of them speak and it was an interesting time.I will here record a matter that gave me great pleasure. On the 2nd of February I united with the Bishop of the 14th Ward and his Council in ordaining 1 Priest 2 Teachers and 2 Deacons 
 Mr Benjamin Kent accompanied us to the meeting place.When we arrived the meeting had commenced. We conversedwith the Deacon of the Church and informed him that we were servants of GodHe communicated the fact to the baptist priest by the name of Gideon J Newtonand also delivered to him our statement that we were servants of God Lord sentwith a message from him to the people and that we wished to be heard. MrNewton did not object and we were invited to the stand by him and he gaveout an appointment for us to preach at 5 o'clock p.m.When he had closed his meeting he invited us home withhim and gave us some refreshments and we presented him with the Book ofMormon. He was mild and said he would read itIn the evening Mr Newton accompanied us to the meetinghouse where the congregation assembled at the appointed time. With peculiarfeelings I arose and addressed them from ##Galatians 1:9|Galations 1st ch and 9th verse##This was the first time that I or any Elder of the Church to my knowledgeever arose before the inhabitants of one of the Islands of the sea to preach tothem the fu^l^lness of the Everlasting Gospel and the Book of Mormon.After I closed I gave out an appointment for each ofthe four following evenings to be held in the several districts of NorthIsland. We spent the night with Mr Benjamin Kent.As I am here fairly at the beginning of my mission tothe Islands of the sea there properly seems to open at this part of my history anew chapter.CHAPTER XI.Description of Vinal Haven, its inhabitants and trade—A view of fifty five Islands.

 and the Priest which I ordained was my son Wilford Woodruff Jr.. He was 13 years of age and he was now beginning to officiate in the Priest's office of the lesser Priesthood. I thanked the Lord that I had lived to see this day when I had a son who received the Priesthood. I prayed the blessings of the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob tro rest upon him that he might honour his calling all the days of his life and do much good in bringing many souls into the Kingdom of God and always maintain the Kingdom of God with all its laws and principlesNext morning Feb 3rd my son Wilford was about to commence to officiate in his office as Priest by going through the Ward to visit the house of each member in company with brother ^D. J.^Ross in the capacity of Teachers in the Ward. So I called my family together for the purpose of prayer and dedicated my son unto the Lord. His father and mother laid hands upon him and blessed him and dedicated ^him^ unto the Lord.

It is about ten miles long and five wide and it isone universal mass of rocks formed into shelves hills and dales cutup into necks and points to make room for the coves and harboursthat run through and through the Island. The populationof the place is one thousand. They get their wealth principallyby fishing and their principal stock is sheep. Some partsof the Islands are under cultivation but it is at the expenceof much labour and toil.

Report camethat Walker the Indian Chief was dead. He died in histent with consumption. This drew out some remarks upon thesubject from President Young. He said that he was thankfulwe had got along as well with the Indians since we hadbeen here. He thought they had improved in their conditionconsidering their limited advantages as much as the Saints haddone in comparison.There was quite an exitement on the Mondayamongover the Gentiles over the preaching in the Tabernacleon the Sunday.The Eastern mail came in and brought mefrom my brother Thompson Woodruff 31 different kinds of applegrafts, the choicest fruit he hadAppointment of a New GovernorThis mail brought news of the appointment of a newGovernor.

 the North district and preached in the school-house. Elder Hale preached uponthe authenticity of the Book of Mormon and I followed him. We spent thenight with Mr Stephen Luce.The next day we again visited the sea shore and gathered somepebbles from the beach which we intended to preserve in memory of theIsland. We also went out with Mr Luce in a boat to catch fish inPenobscot Bay. On entering the mouth of the bay we found it coveredwith a sholal of Pohagen fish extending over acres of sea. It wassupposed that there were in the shoal enough fish to fill five hundredthousand barrels. We caught none of them but saw and heard themrush in large bodies upon the top of the water. Afterwards we walkedto the school house where I preached to a large congregation amongwhom was Priest Newton.The day following I visited Eleazar Carvers on theeast part of the Island. I stood on his farm and took a viewof fifty-five Islands of the sea: a part of them were inhabited andsome were not. There were also twenty ships under sail taken intomy view of the scene. At night ^In the evening^ we preached in the east schoolhouse and spent the night at Mr Luce'sThe day after we preached at the west school houseto a large congregation and stayed with Deacon Hezekiah Eamesand on the following one Elder Hale preached in the east schoolhouse and I in the west. This day in visiting Benjamin Crabtree Esq I found in his library an account of John Calvinburning Servetus a French physician for differing from him inreligious views.Next day I preached in the North school house andon the following one, Sunday, I preached at East Parish on faithin the morning and in the evening to a large congregationin the Baptist meeting house on the coming of Christ. I gaveout five appointments for the week. I was informed that the RevMr Newton had not a soul besides himself to attend his meetingThus, without entering into the detail of every day,it must be understood that our mis^s^ion was pushed forward withthe same labour and spirit in our ministry and on the 23rd ^3rd of September^ afterdelivering two discourses I opened a door for baptism when twocandidates offered themselves for the ordinance. They were Capt.Justus Eames and his wife. We immediately walked to thesea shore and Elder Hale baptized them. They were the first 
 It was also reported theat Secretary Harris was to be sent backto us as our Secretary. The paper mail was left out at LaramieThe Indians did not disturb them on the way but many weregathering east of Laramie. The papers reported a war in theNebraska Territory between the Missourians and SettlersOn the 10th I attended the meeting of theUniversal Scientific Association. The Constitutionwas again read and the Committee reported that all theofficers chosen had received their appointments. Speecheswere made by several members and by the President andVice PresidentsOn the 15th the Society again met at theHistorian's Office. We spent several hours together in layingplans for the instruction and edification of the people. TheBoard wished me to deliver an opening address.I spent part of the next day at theHistorian's Office examining my Journal containingJoseph's sermons preparatory for publication in theChurch History.Our Views Concerning the GovernmentIt had been given out a week previous that President Youngwould preach to the people on Sunday February the 18th uponour views concerning the Government of the United Statesand all the strangers were invited to attend. aAt an early hourthe Tabernacle was full and a thousand people who could not getinto the house. A large congregation out of doors who couldnot get into the Tabernacle was called together by Elder OrsonPratt and he preached to them.A good many strangers were gathered together 
 called upon us and spent the evening. We talked over the days of Kirtland and other times. I read over several of the old sermons of Joseph not recorded anywhere only in my Journal. We spent a pleasant evening. Before they left Sister Whitney sung in tongues in the pure language which Adam and Eve made use of in the garden of Eden. This gift was obtained while in Kirtland through the promise of Joseph. He told her if she would rise upon her feet (while in a meeting) she should have the pure language. She did so and immediately commenced singing in tongues. It was as near heavenly music as anything I ever heardOn the 6th I attended meeting with the Perpetual Emigration Fund Company which adjourned till the first Monday in March.I took out of the Library the first Vol. of th[e]Live [Life] of Benjamin Franklin read it through during the day was highly interested and instructed by its perusal and extracted into my Daily Journal from his rules of perfection which he endeavoured to carry out in his lifeViews of The ResurrectionSunday the 19th E. D. Woolley was called upon to preach upon the resurrection as some of the Saints had advanced some eronious ideas. When he closed President Young followed and made many good remarks among which he said:We should have our same identical bodies which our Spirits occupied in this life; our graves would literally be opened and our bodies come forth. The question was asked if children who died in their infancy lost anything. He said, "No; a person would not lose anything which they had not got. Children who died in infancy would be provided for in some way.He also said, our God was Father Adam He was the Father of the Saviour Jesus ^Christ^. Our God was 
 he ever administered the ordinance of baptism to and the first fruitsof the Church upon the Islands of the sea. I gave out an appointmentfor the next Sabbath and administered in the confirmation of brotherand sister Eames.The next day we visited brother Eames and housholdand found them rejoyicing in the Lord. While there a young mancame in to enquire what he should do to be saved. I taughthim as Peter did on the day of Pentecost. [##Acts 2:14-40##] The Spirit of was like leaven in the IslandWe then took a boat and crossed to South FoxIsland. We had a pleasent sail of about a mile and half and we sung on our way "In a gallant sphip we ride," &c. I rejoyicedto stand upon another Island of the sea to preach the GospelWe immediately gave out an appointment at School house No 1. Elder Hale preached and I followledThe next day we went to the top of a high ledge andstoped on a smooth granite rock covering two acres. Some of the face of it was covered with a light soil out of which grew the pinethe whoretlebury and wintergreen. We sat down under the shade of a pine for morning prayers. Brother Hale read the ##Jeremiah 16|XVI ch. of Jeremiah## which speaks of the hunters and fishers which God wouldsend in the last days to gather Israel. Of a truth here we wereon an Island of the sea standing upon a rock where we could [survey]the ships and the places arround as full of rocks holes and cavesas any part of the earth and were here to search out theblood of Ephraim and gather him from these Islands rocks holes and caves.I sat in company with Elder Hale and while thesun was shedding his beams to gladden the earth the spirit of Godcaused our souls to rejoice.We read and sung and rejoiced in the Lord; wespake of the ancient Prophets and Apostles in Jerusalem in Asiaand also of Nephi Alma Mormon Moroni and others in AmericaWe also spake of Joseph Oliver Sidney and of the Twelve and theSeventies. Nor did we forget brothers Kimball and Hide andthe others on their mission to England and the Elders on their missionsin general. While filled with these meditations and the promisesof God we fell upon our knees and prayed unto the Lord for allIsrael and especially for Joseph. 
 in the Tabernacle. After singing, and prayer by Wilford WoodruffPresident Young arose and said that as he did not expect to be able tospeak to the people he had prepared an address to be read before theassembly and when that is read, he said, I will say a few words.Thomas Bullock then read the address before the congregationPresident Young in his written address sustainedthe Constitution of the United States also its laws but he used asharp two edged swoard against wickedness and wicked men in highplaces and when it was finished ^he followed^ with a lengthy cutting oral addresswhich was sharper and more pointed than his written one. Thisspeach was fully reported and may be found in the Deseret News of thatdate and also in the Journal of DiscoursesOrdination of the Son of Hyrum SmithTo the Office ofFirst Patriarch of the ChurchFeb 18, 1856^5^After the meetings at the Tabernacle on the day President Youngdelivered his speech on the Government of the United States I hadthe satisfaction of seeing John Smith the eldest son of our martyredPatriarch Hyrum Smith set in the middle of our prayer circleand Presidents Young Kimball and Grant and Orson Pratt WilfordWoodruff George A Smith and Lorenzo Snow of theTwelve Apostles laid hands upon his head and ordainedhim unto the office of the first Patriarch in the Church andKingdom of God.

 no more nor less than Adam, Michael the ArchangelOn the 1st of March I was 47 years of age.The California mail came in on the 3rd bringing news among which was that Santa Anna was proclaimed Emperor of Mexico.On the 10th I met in council with President Kimball and the Twelve. I ordained three Elders. We had a good council and Elder Kimball spoke powerfully for the space of three hours and warned the Elders who were going out on mission against sin in all its forms and to keep the commandments of GodDeath of President Willard RichardsWho died March the 11th 1854After President Willard Richards was reduced to deaths door; by the laying on of hands and the prayer of faith he was raised up so that he walked about his room and appeared as though he was going to get well; but he was taken by a relapse and had been failing for several days. This morning he appeared worse and the Twelve were sent for to come and administer to him; but before we could get there he was dead. He drop[p]ed away almost without a groan Thus closed the life of brother Willard Richards on the morning of the 11th of March 1854 at about 30 minutes past 9 o'clock.President Willard Richards was born at Hopkintown Middlesex County Massachusetts June 24th 1804 and from early youth was the subject of religious impressions though car[e]less and indifferent in his external deportment. At the age of 10 he removed with his fathers family into Richmond in the same State where he witnessed several sectarian revivals and at the age of seventeen had passed the ordeal of conviction and conversion. He sought admission into the Church which being disregarded led him to a stricter investigation of religion 
 Sunday the 10th we met a large congregation at brother JustusEames. After meeting I opened a door for baptism when another seaCaptain the brother of Captain Eames offered himself for the ordinanceas did also a young lady. I rejoiced greatly to find the captains ofthe sea enter the New and Everlasting Covenant and as I stood uponthe shore after baptising these new members of the Church I addressedthe people under the Spirit of God and they were cut to the heart.Things moved along with us in our ministry daily muchaccording the first part of our mission to the Islands of the sea exceptingthat the Rev Mr Newton and also the Methodist priest turned againstand opposed us.I preached baptized visited the other Island of thesea and on Sunday October 1st we organized a small Branchtwelve in number and for the first time administered thesacrament to the Saints here.On the next day we started to return to ourfriends in Scarborough and capt Valentine Eames offered to conveyus to Thomaston in his sloop. He also promised to obey theGospel on our return, which promise he kept.We reached my wife's father's on the sixth and Iremained in this part with the Saints preaching &c until the 28thwhen I started to return to the Islands. In the intervalbrother Hale had left for Kirtland and this time my wifePhebe accompanied meAfter our journey and a stormy passage onthe way I again was on the Islands of the sea with my wifewhere I found the Saints rejoicing in God and strong in thefaith. We were welcomed by them with much joy and warmthof affection.It was on the second of November when I returnedand continued my mission as before and an the 15th I went onboard the Susan Eliza with Capt Coombs to sail to the Isle of Holt.There was much snow on board the vessel. We had a fair windbut a rough sea and pleasent over head.We arrived at the Isle of Holt at 12 o'clockand I preached at early candle light in the school house. I spentthe night with John Turner esq and sold him the Book ofMormon. This is the third Island of the sea that I havevisited to preach the Gospel. 
 most of my family to the Ward meeting. The house was fullto overflowing. I went into the stand with the BishopThe Spirit of God was upon me. I felt full of ^the spirit of God^ the Spirit of Godand fire that had eminated from President Young that dayand I spoke to the people with power and sharp reproof ofsin and against becoming corrupted by the GentilesOn the 1st of March I was 48 years of age.I found time rapidly hurrying me through life.Brothe Joseph Russell died on the morningof the 10 of March 20 minutes past two o'clock. He wasabout 70 years of age, was from Merimichi. He had beena faithful Latter-day Saint and was a High Priest. He hadgiven nearly all his means to the Church amounting in allto about seventy thousand dollars. I attended his funeral next day.In the afternoon of the 22nd I attendedthe Mayor's Court. The military officers had enteredcomplaint against some boys for running horses by themand insulting them in the streets. The suit wasdismissed on account of their being no law against runninghorses and the officers had the costs to payI went to Toille on the 31st a distanceof 40 miles from Great Salt Lake City.

We had a great showerof rain during the afternoon and evening yet Ezra TBenson preached to them in the afternoon and wehad a good meeting notwithstanding the rain. 
 and he became convinced that God had no Church on earth and from that time he kept aloof from sectarian influence.In the Summer of 1835 while in the practice of medecine near Boston the Book of Mormon which President Brigham Young had left with his cousin Lucius Parker at Southborough providentially fell in his way. He opened the book without regard to place and totally ignorant of its design or contents and before reading half a page said, "God or the devil ^has^ had a hand in that book, for man never wrote." He read it twice through in about ten days and became so convinced of the work of God that he resolved to close his business and go to Kirtland to the Saints a distance of seven hundred miles; but he was directly smitten with the pas^l^y [palsy] from which he suffered greatly and which prevented the execution of his design until October 1836 when he arrived in Kirtland in company with his brother (Doctor Levi Richards who attended him as a physician) where he was warmly received by his cousin Brigham Young with whom he tarried and gave the work a thorough investigation.On the 31st of December 1836 at the setting of the sun Doctor Willard Richards was baptized at Kirtland under the hands of President Brigham Young in the presence of Heber C. Kimball and others who had spent the afternoon in cutting the ice to prepare for the baptism.He was chosen by revelation through the Prophet Joseph in July 1838 to be ordained one of the Twelve Apostles and was ordained accordingly at Preston England, while on a mission to that country under the hands of the Twelve in their first council as a quorum among the nations at which were present Brigham Young Heber C.

He was a great Counsellor in the Church and I as well as the body of the Saints have received much excellent Counsel from him. He was the first man who had a natural death in the Church from the First Presidency or the Twelve Apostles. All who had died of them before had been martyred.On the day after the death of President Richards in company with his brother Levi Richards and George A. Smith I called upon President Brigham Young at his room for he was not able to get out. We conversed with him conscerning the burial of Brother Willard and he advised us to

 bury him at 2 o'clock.We met according to advise at 2 oclock at the house of our departed brother and President Heber C. Kimball took charge of the ceremony. President Brigham Young was not able to be present with us.George A Smith made the prayer. He prayed earnestly thatfor President Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball and the person who should be chosen as Willard Richard's successor also for the Twelve Apostles that they might prove true to their integrity as brother Richards had done even unto the end. He prayed for the wives and children of our lamented friend and brother and that the Spirit of Willard might rest upon his oldest son Heber John that he might stand at the head of his father's house in dignity and honour. Elder Watt reported his prayer in detailAt the close of the prayer the procession was formed. Brother Kimball and Bishop Hunter walked in front of the cor[p]se and the Twelve Apostles walked by the side of it while his wives children relatives and friends followed and a procession formed behind them and as he was borne to his grave two bands played a solemn death march.After our brother was lowered into his grave Orson Hyde delivered a short appropriate address and while his remarks were being made the times which I had spent with brother Richards in a foreign country came to my mind and I felt solemn and lonesome under the reflectionAfter the burial I called upon the family and conversed with them and then attended prayer meeting with the Twleve; and with Brother Kimball and Franklin Richards returned to Willard Richards family and spent the evening with them and brother Kimball conversed with them till 9 o'clock and gave them much counsel.

 to oppose our inroads upon his kingdom. Elder Ball wasspeaking when a canon or swivel was discharged near the houseon the sea shore followed quickly by a discharge of small armsI arose, the Spirit of God rested upon me, and I declared theword of God unto the people in great plainness while my wordswere at times missed with the report of musketry outside thehouse. I was plain in declaring the judgements of God, andcalled upon the congregation to know if any wished to be baptisedwhen two arose and offered themselves for the ordinance.The next day we met a company uponthe beach to attend to the ordinance of baptism. Aftersinging a hymn I led a man down into the water andbaptized him; and as on the night previous we weresaluted with the report of fire arms. From thence wewent to the east school house to hold a meeting whichwas interupted by a mob. As soon as we beganthey commenced to disturb us by walking across the houseand talking whistling singing dancing &c. We wereforced to close in confusionWe lear[n]t the day after that Notices wereposted up in conspicuous parts warning us to leave thetown but we concluded to obey God rather than manso we continued in our Master's business.On this day we held a prayer-meetingwhen two offered themselves for baptism and on thefollowing one we baptized three more and held anotherprayer-meeting at night. The day after I crossed theThoroughfare and held a meeting at Isaac Crocketts whenthe power of God rested upon us and we prophesied andspoke in tongues. Capt Isaac Crockett and William Merchant offered themselves for baptism which wasattended to on the morrow.Thus in spite of the hinderences whichSatan sought to put in our way and much oppositionfrom the Rev Mr Douglass, the Methodist priest, thework of God prospered and we continued travellingthrough the Islands engaged in daily ministerial laboursNearly a month later Feb 13th wecrossed the bay to Camden and on the next day 
 said that he believed the Saints the other side of the veil are gathered together the same as they are in the life while the world are scattered over the earth after death the same as they are now and in the same confussion and that there would be head quarters of the gathering from which they would send out missionaries to preach the Gospel to the Spirits in prison. Brother Kimball advised the females to hold together and remain as they were on Brother Willardsinheritance and not marry again but to keep themselves for him and to be united together and assist each other all they could.The second day from this I spent in the Council House with brother Kimball and the Twelve. Brother Kimball was speaking upon principle and giving counsel for four hours.On the 18th I rode to Grantsville and on the next day which was Sunday I preached to them and gave them counsel to close up their fort. There were many Indians there who were friendly. After meeting I rode 12 miles to Toille City and preached to the people in the eveningNext day with brother Maugn I rode to brother Bates and from thence to the new city near Benson's Mill and held a meeting with the people who all agreed to build in a fort. The day following I returned to Salt Lake CityOn the 27 the Twelve met at my house in the evening to bless the missionaries who were going to England. We had a good meeting.

 had some important and interesting teachings which was ^were^ not reported.The follow is a key to his remarks brought out in social conversationViews of President Young on the Fall and ResurrectionHe referred to the preaching of Orson Hyde and Orson Prattthe Sabbath before upon the subject of the resurrection. He saidthe identicals particles of matter in which we had honored our spiritsi.e. our tabernacles in which we had suffered travelled labored andbuilt up the Kingdom of God they would be the identical bodies andno other. They would be raised from the grave to immortalityand eternal livesHe said Adam and Eve had lived upon anotherearth and were immortal when they came here. Adam assistedin forming this earth and agreed to fall when he came here and hefell that man might be; and the opposite principle to good—the Devil the Serpaent the Evil was placed upon the earth thatman might know the good from the evil for without anexperience in those things men could not know one from theother.As soon as the Devil was upon the earth he sowedthe seeds of death in everything; so that as soon as Adamand Eve began to eat of the fruit of the earth they receivedinto their systems the seeds of mortality and of death. Sotheir children were mortal and subject to death sorrow and painwho then when they partook of life joy ease and happinesswould know how to prise it. Father Adam would nevercease his labors to redeem his posterity and exalt them to allthe glory they were capable of receiving. He did not doubtthat Father Adam knew in the beginning how manyof his posterity would receive a celestial glory and whothey were and also of a terrestial and a telestial; yet man had

At night we preached in the School houseat this place.I left on the following day with Elder Ball andJames Towndsend to go a distance of three miles. On our waywe repaired to a Grove to hold a Council and the Holy Ghost saidSeperate unto ne [me] James for the ministry. So we ordainedhim to the office of an Elder.

The roads were drifted with snowand the people feared we could not get through but wewent forward in the Lord. The winds were high andthe air was filled with snow.

 place in the First Presidency? is a question that has not yet been answered though many have talked to me about it. I have asked the Twelve to dictate this part of the business but they have thrown it back. Well I will say where it ought to be. They said it was not their place to dictate the affair but to confirm the conclusions of the President. If the Conference will show the best method of knowing who is the best man to be my Second Counsillor I will readily listen to their wisdom. The Twelve would have nothing to do with it but said it was the privilege of the President to choose his own Counsellor and for them to run the risk of its being right or wrong. However if the Conference wish to dictate this matter I will give them an opportunity. That is my method of doing business; as long as we are of one heart and of one mind there is no ground for discord or dissension."The President also spoke upon the subject of appointing new gathering places designing to establish three or four new locations for this purpose East and West especially ^for^ the emigration from EuropeIn the afternoon Orson Hyde addressed the meeting and was followed by George A Smith and President Young upon the subject of the Indian warI met in council with President Young and council and the quorum of the Twelve and Parley P.

Touching the matter President Kimball said that what President Young had presented to the people to carry out was only what we had in our houses for years. All have to be purchased. I want all I have to be secured in the Kingdom of God. If the Presidency and Twelve enter into this order they

Sister Stone andmy wife came out to see us. And while we werebusy engaged in this the tide arose and flowed betwenus and the shore. We were under the necessity ofwading through the water ourselves and carrying thewoman ashore in an arm chair. Having got fairlythrough the task we concluded that we should not soonforget the place and returned home with our clams.On the 28th I received three letters twofrom our friends in Scarborough and one from JonathanHale from Kirtland. It contained an account of theSaints leaving that place for the land of Zion and ofthe judgments of God that was overtaking it and aboutto come upon the whole land. He sent me the counsel ofthe Presidency of our quorum which was that I shouldteach the Saints upon the Islands of the sea to imme-diately sell their property and prepare themselves to goup to the land of Zion.

I told Joseph Young to have the Seventies all ordained ApostlesOn the evening of the 23rd I met with the Missionaries in company with Orson Hyde Parley P. Pratt J. Taylor George A. Smith and Erastus Snow of the Twleve and we blessed about forty Elders who were set apart to go to the various nations of the earth. At the close of the blessings they were addressed by Parley Pratt upon their outfit &c and journey across the Plain: George A Smith 
 The Lord was manifesting his work to the Saintsupon the Islands of the sea in dreams visions signshealings and wonders. One remarkable circumstanceI will mention.Mr Ebenezer Carver had been earnestlyinvestigating the Gospel and while desiring to know thetruth of it he walked towards the sea shore and desiringthat he might have some signs. But the word of Godupon which he was meditating was that there should beno sign given but the sign of the Prophet Jonas [##Matthew 12:39##]On a sudden there was a large fish aroseon the water in the sea at a distance from him andit as suddenly sunk out of sight. He desired againto see it and immediately the fish arose a secondtime upon the top of the water accompanied by anotherfish of the same species and size. One of them swamin a straight line on the top of the water towards MrCarver as he stood upon the beach. When the fishcame as near his feet as the water would permitit looked at the man with a penetrating eye as thoughit had a message for him. The fish then returnedto its mate and swam out of sight.Mr Carver returned home meditating uponthe strange sight. It is worthy of remark that thistook place at a time of the year when fish of thatsize is not known upon these shores and they neverat any season come ashore as in this case. Thus Iwas informed and Mr Carver had dreams confirming thatit was a sign to him.Two days later, April 1st I preached toa large congregation at Mr Carver's and after the meetingbaptized his wife where the fish came to him. Manywere beleiving.But about this time Warren Parrishwho had travelled with me in the ministry but whowas now cut off from the Church wrote to the Post-master of this Island a long letter against the workof God whose advocate he had once been. He spokefavourably of my character but said that I was deceived 
 into 4 rooms each. The second story had the same width alley runningthrough the building and the sides were divided into three rooms each, theupper story was to be finished into one room or hall. The basementstory wall was three feet thick and the remainder of the building 2 feetthick. At this time the cornish was on and a part of the roofshingled.All the way from Great Salt Lake City on our journeyto Fillmore we found nearly all the crops of wheat eaten upby the grasshopersWe stayed at Filmore one night and on the morrowwe journeyed to Corn Creek which contained a settlement of Indiansof the Parvaosts ^Parvants^. David Kaanosh Tashobets was theirprincipal ChiefWe stoped a short time with the Indians andabout a dozen of them with their chiefs mounted their horses androde with us on our journey. The Indians shot prarie dogsand rabbits for their supper. They roasted the dogs a little and theneat them entrails young ones and all. We camped at Cove^rn^ Creekafter a distance of 40 miles travel during the day.Two days later we reached Parowan. Herewe met George A. Smith and visited his flouring mill whichwas a good establishmentIn the evening we held a meeting with thepeople. President Young preached upon the law of consecrationand Wilford Woodruff reported itThe mail from California came in theday previous and brought me a letter from Edward Partridge and2 numbers of the "Mormon" published by John Taylor atNew York.Next day we reached Cedar. I stoped withbrother Jonathan Pugmire and after dinner visited the ironworksI was rejoiced to find them in full blast making good iron 
 addressed them upon keeping journals and histories of their travels and the dealings of God with them in their ministryElders John Taylor and Orson Hyde also addressed them Several days previous to this we blessed 35 other missionariesSunday the 30th I visited Father John Smith the Patriarch who laid at the point of death. His sons George A Smith and John L. Smith were watching over him with the greatest care and attention. His mind and memory were as clear and strong and his intellectual powers as operative as in any day of his life.Journey SouthMay the 3rd Presidents Young and Kimball with a company left the city to visit all the Southern settlements. I left with them Truman O. Angel and Dr Sprague as my companions. I drove to Bishop Smoots at the Sugar Works and stoped until brother Angel layed out a part of the works. Mrs Woodruff and child rode down with me and here I parted from them and we drove to Union Ward over which Silas Richards was BishopWe held a meeting in the evening: President Young addressed the people. I was not in at the commencement and had no chance of reporting his discourse. The following is a key to his address which I have written from memorySynopsis of a Discourse of President Young."I do not wish to spend my time neither is it profitable for any man to spend his time in telling the people what was done in the days of Adam Enoch and Noah thousands of years ago but my business is to tell the people what they should do to day in order to be saved. This is my doctrine all the time. What can I do or this people do to-day in any one thing in order to build up the kingdom of God or to advance any step farther towards the salvation 
 This letter was written for the purpose of being madepublic and was for that reason addressed to the Postmaster. Itwas read by the people beleived by many and used by ouropposers causing persecution to rage. The letter was also handedto me by the Postmaster to read.It might be here stated that Warren Parrishfell through disappointed ambition. He aspired to thequorum of the Twelve or to be a leading spirit of theChurch. He was what is termed a smart man andthrough his smartness distorted by ambition and envyand the bitterness thereof he turned against Joseph andthe Church, having fallen into darkness and given himselfup to the power of SatanNotwithstanding the letter of Warren Parrishand the opposition which we met we continued to increaseour numbers. On the 7th I baptized Ephraim Luceand Margarett Crockett and confirmed them by thelaying on of hands. Sister Luce was also healed ofsickness by the imposition of hands. I then walkedto Mr Ebenezer Carver's and preached to the people andafterwards preached ^baptised^ Mrs Abigal Carver. She was over70 years of age and had not been to a neighbour's housefor six years; but on this occasion she went withspirit to the sea shore and was baptized and returnedstrengthened in body and mind.A Conference of Elders met agreeable to ourappointment at the house of Bro Justus Ames on North FoxIsland Vinal Haven on the 13th of April. Elders Milton Holmes and James Townsend and Priest Abner Rogers hadcome to attend it. North Fox Island was representedby myself as containing 25 members in good standingand also 3 members in Camden. Elder Holmes representedthe New Rowley Branch containing 11 members in good standing.During this Conference there were several ordained and onebaptized.Several days after my wife started from theIsland to return to her father's house and I soon afteralso left the Islands of the sea for it was manifested untous by revelation that it was our duty to take a western 
 and casting pipes cranks and what they needed about the works. They hadtried for several years to make iron but could not accomplish it until ^of^ lateThe Presidency and most of the company were present to see them cast andwas much pleased. We examined the works, coak coal and ore ofdifferent kinds and took specimens with us, and then returned to thecity from which the ironworks were situated about one mileCedar City contained one hundred and forty fivefamilies with 725 souls. Their fort was surrounded with a wallhalf a mile square 8 feet high and 18 inches thick built of adobies andstones. They had 145 buildings and very good ones for the time theplace had been settled. There was also a tithing office 43 by25 feet two stories a good cellar and the upper room finished. Itcost 25 hundred dollars. The main portion of the building wasnot finished. They had a meeting house 60 by 25 feet andhad three schools during the Winter two men schools and onefemale; and there were two schools during the SummerThe Settlement much needed men and teems to carry on their ironworksWe held a council in the evening. The Presidencyand Twelve were present. The time was spent in chit chat upon theconsecration and other thingsIn the afternoon of Sunday the 20th ofMay at the commencement of the meeting President Young said "Wehave some Church business to attend to and I remove that we resolveourselves into a Special Conference." It was seconded and carriedunanimouslyIt was then moved and carried that Isaac Haightbe appointed the President of this stake of Zion which embracesthe ^ceder^ city of Harmony and Johnson's Fort; and that he choose histwo counsellors.It was moved and carried that Jonathan Pugmire SenRobert Willey Samuel White Richard Harrison Perry ListonIria Allen Samuel Lee Laban Morrel Rufus C Allen 
 of ourselves or our brethrenNow what has been the councisel to this people for several years past? It has been to ^build^ f^or^t^s^ up; to wall in your cities with strong walls This has been the voice of the Lord unto them all the day long. Have the people listened to this voice? Have they carried out this counsel? No they have not? But what have they done? They have been ready to say what nead hath the Lord of this thing? Do you realthink there is any danger of the Indians? Do you think that brother Brigham really believes that it is necessary to go to so much expence in building walls around our cities?Instead of going to work and doing what they are told to do the people spend their time in talking about it and trying to evade it.Now I wish to ask a question. The Lord has appointed me to lead this people. The people have chosen me as their leader and covenanted to sustain me and obey my counsel. Now if I tell the people what to do and they do not do it nor carry out my counsel but turn from it and go to work and do something else and they continue this year after year while at the same time I am warning them of the danger of their course and telling them of the judgements which will come upon them if they do not alter their course and go to work and do as I have told them do you suppose they will escape the chastening rod of the Almighty? No they will not.If the people continue to pursue their presentcourse and the chastening rod does not fall upon their heads I should become disregarded in the sight of God angels and men. This people may rest assured that they are preparing a rod for their ^own^ backs if they do not listen to my counsel and do what I tell themBut says one I would go to work and help build a wall around the city if I knew it was a revelation from God and that it was His will we should do it. I want to say to such that it is my will that you should do it and that it is enough. I am responsible for it and if you want to know any farther about it do right. Pray unto the Lord and have faith before him that you may have visions and revelations from God so that you 
 mission and leave the Islands for a season; for theybeen faithfully warned the Saints sought out and theenemy were combined in secret places against whowould take our lives if in their power.I left on the morning of the 28th of Aprilin company of Priest Thomas and brother M. Luce.We went in a sail boat. The wind being against uswe had to row hard against both wind and tide forsix miles. We then changed our course and hoistedone sail which with the help of one oar gave us morespeed and after rowing and sailing 20 miles we landedabout noon at Owl's head.The next day we walked 40 miles andsuffered much during the day with blistered feet andweary limbs. This was also the case on our nextday's journey of 30 miles. But on the afternoon ofthis day we arrived at Father Carter's and I hadthe privilege of again meeting my friends and wifewhom I found all in good health and spiritsI only remained at the house of my father-in-laaw seven days and I again bid adieu to mywife and her father's household and in company ofMilton Holmes continued my travels in the ministry.On the first day we journeyed 35 milesand on the next walked to the Navy-yard Portsmouth N. H.Here we spent several hours and had an interesting viewof the war ships cannon balls shot &c. We visited onefrigate of sixty guns and a ship of war of 120 gunsWe also visited the building where her rigging anchors&c were kept. We then walked 20 miles fartherto Georgetown making a distance in the day of35 miles.I spent several ^the next^ days at Father Holmes'and on the next I bid adieu to Father Homes and familyHis son Milton remained but Elder Joseph Ball becamemy companion and we started and walked to SalemThis is the renowned place where so many where executedon the charge of whitchcraft so that the story of theSalem whitches has become a household tale. 
 may understand the truth and know what lies before us as I do and then you will not question the reasonableness of these things but go to work and do them with all your mightMy teaching is to tell the people what to do to be saved to-day for if you get out of the path of salvation to day you are in danger of being out of it to-morrow and the farther you stray from it the more difficulty you will meet in ever finding it againIt would be folly in my spending my time in telling the people about the glories of the Millennium while I see them straying from those paths that would lead to those gloriesNow many of this people will say I have fine farms horses cattle goods gold and riches. The possessor says I look upon them; I say these are mine. At the same time you do not once think that there is not one thing in your possession that is yours. It all belongs to God; and even you yourselves belong to God. All you have belong[s] to Him and He has only loaned it to you and yet you do not acknowledge his hand in anything while you should acknowledge his hand in all thingsI know what the design of the Lord is in leading the people to this place and his design concerning Israel and it is none of your business what I counsel you to do. It is your business to go to work and do it. Leave the event with God.I want this people to build their forts as I tell them and when you have built this fort and made a wall six feet thick and twelve feet high and get comfortable in your houses then go to work and build one on the outside 12 feet thick and run them both up together 25 feet high and keep building until I tell you to stop and be in a situation that you may shut up your gates and lie down and sleep in f safety with your wives and children.Many other interesting remarks were made by the President which I was not able to record 
 The 11th of May was the following day and it was amost interesting one indeed. I arose in the morning, refreshedby sleep and took breakfast with Father ^Alley^ at whose house westayed. We then [took] our farewell of him and sister Alley andwalked to Chelsea and thence to CharlestonHere we visited the Bunker Hill monument andwalked upon the entrenchments that was flung up by ourbrave fathers during the night preceding that memorable battleupon Bunker Hill. But the roar of cannon and the clashof arms had long ceased but the sound from the populouscity of Boston was now buzzing through the air whileour fathers were sleeping in peace.As we passed along we had a good viewof the Navy yard and thence we entered the City of BostonThis was the first time my feet trod its streets or myeyes beheld its wealth.I spent several hours in visiting the citywhich at that time contained a population of one hundredthousand. The market-place of Boston was probablyas neat beautiful and well furnished as any one inAmerica. The starchhouse which we visited was alsoa fine place. We went to the Cupalo and had afair view of the whole city. I walked around thecommons which was inclosed with an iron railing ofabout 2 1/2 miles in length. We visited the Tremont Housethe most noted place house in the city, and also the shipingWe dined at Mr Thayre's in Belknap Street upon a richsalmon, called upon several of the Saints during the dayvisited South Boston and had a fair view of thesplendid Mount Washington House a place of entertainmentfor gentlemen who wish to retire from the bustle andnoise of the city.I next walked over longbridge to Cambridge& from thence to Cambridge point. I went to the goal inorder to have an interview with Albert P. Rockwood andto comfort him.Brother Rockwood had been cast into prisonby his enemies for debts in order to trouble and distresshim.

The Lord will not explain all things unto us. He understands; but he will make his people walk by faith. He will not explain all his mysteries to the people. We read in the ##JST, Hebrews 11:1|New Testament## that faith is the assurance of things hoped for—the evidence of things not seen.Have we all got faith? It is our duty to have faith in God and his word and promise. You have to trust in God. He will not reveal all things unto usSome men are tried with the counsel given and will not obey. They will not have glory in the Kingdom of God They are bastards and not sons. The Lord intends for the people to be tried so as to prove the faithful. What God does reveal he reveals for the purpose of leading men in the way of salvationThe people do not know the way of the Lord They come here and say I am going to build myself up. I have to work so hard I cannot get time to pray. But are you doing right when you do this? We may labour to get all things about us yet the Lord will control it as seemeth him goodIf you get into the dark still hold on to the work of God. No matter if I don't feel like praying I 
 When I arrived at the prison the jailor permittedme to enter the room where brother Rockwood was confinedAt this time we were strangers after the flesh but relatedin the Gospel. This was the first time I had evervisited an^y^ Elder ^one^ in prison.After the keeper had turned the key uponus and left us together I began to enquire into thestate of his mind and found him strong in thefaith. He had the Bible Book of Mormon Parley'sVoice of Warning and the Evening and Morning Staras his companions which he constantly readWe conversed together about three hours and heinformed me of many things that had transpired whilethere. Among the variety he mentioned the goal takingfire a few days before my visit. He said this lookedlike a dark hour. The fire was roaring over his headwhile a scene of uproar confusion and distress wasupon every hand; the engines were rapidly playing aroundthe building water poured into every room the peoplehallooing in the streets the prisoners crying for mercyto be let out lest they should be consumed one of thenumber was struggling in the agonies of death whileothers were cursing swearing &c. He said he felt composedthrough the confused scene until the fire was extinguishedBro Rockwood was writing his life whilein confinement; and he sent a roll of the same byme to his wife in Holliston.At half past 8 o'clock p.m. the jailor cameand unlocked the prison doors and I left brother R. inspirits and bent my way back to the city of BostonWhen crossing the long bridge on my return I heard thecry of fire the ringings of bells and the ratling of enginesThe flames soon illuminated the city but in half an hourit was extinguishedBeing alone and a strange in the darknessof the night I lost my way in the midst of the city butafter wandering awhile I found No 9 Myrtle Street whereElder Ball and a company of Saints were patiently waitingfor me. Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour I spent 
 We reached Salt Creek Fort on the 25. It was 104rods square. The wall 6 feet thick at the bottom 2 1/2 at the top andit had reached 6 feet in height. This fort contained 80 families andthree hundred and fifty persons.Provo City in 1855At this date the city of Provowas one mile square with a wall the same which was 6 feet thickat the bottom 2 at the top and 12 feet high. One half of the wall wasfinished. Its population was 2500, five hundred families andhouses some of which were good and many improvements were visibleThere was one Seminary containing 4 school rooms four schoolswere kept containing 100 scholars.

 will do it.If the Lord should open the vision ^of the minds^ of the people who have gone to California so that they could see things as they are they would as soon cut their throats as to have done it. But they dont see it: they have to go and suffer until they are satisfiedI will say the same to this people. If we do not the things which God requires we shall be whiped until we are sore. This is the only thing that will save us. I now tell you that those who are gone and are going to California without counsel will have it till they are soreI know the truth but I cannot tell it all to you until God permits me to do it. Now if you have not confidence in me to follow me and believe that I am doing right drop me and appoint another and I will follow in the wakeIn the beginning of this work God tried to get this people to be one but they would not be one. I will tell you what to do. God intends to make you one. You must be one and there must be a beginning to this. And you must begin in small things like children making cob houses.The people went to Missouri and there they quarrelled about many small matters. Then God said I will throw down their good houses; and God drove ^all the people^ out and then they were knocked into pi. Did they do any better then? No they did not. God tries his people both with riches and with poverty If I will ^am^ be faithful in my poverty I will ^shall^ own all riches that is neadful.Now God wants us to be of one heart and one mind He may have no other motive than to make us work together. He will tell us to build fences and forts that our feelings and interests may be united in something. Now will you do it? We are required to become of one heart and mind and work together in these little things that we do understand or else we could not be prepared to work together and be one in those eternal things which we do not 
 a season in teaching them the things of God. I then went withElder Ball to his mother's house where we spent the night. Thisended a day of variety crowded with incidents. I had also walked25 miles during the day.I spent several days in Boston comforting the littleChurch there most of whom were sisters. We left on the 14th andtravelled to Deacon John Haven's on the edge of Holliston. Here wefound sister Rockwood.

We journeyedthis day 30 miles.The next we walked to Holliston and spent the dayand at night preached.On the day following we walked 32 miles toProvidence. We were now in the State of Rhode Island. Thisis the SIXTEENTH STATE that I have visited inmy travels.We went on board of the steamer Rhode Islandat half past 4 p.m. for New York city where we arrivedthe next day.This was the first time that I had beheld theprincipal city of America. Several hours were spent in scearch ofsome of the Saints and at length found brother David W. RogersGree[nwich street]After dinner we went to Hamersly Street No 26where we found Elder Orson Pratt and family. Here we continuedwith the New York Saints from the 18th to the 21st on whichday I wrote to the Saints up[on] the Islands of the sea and left withbrother Ball for Newburg per steam boat at 5 o'clock p.m.and arrived at 9 p.m.We remained on board for the night and inthe morning started and travelled 35 miles to Westown. Inthis place and the district around we tarried until the 8thof June preaching and labouring with the people arOn the last day of May after taking breakfastwith Mr Elston I took a walk with Elder Ball into theState of New JerseyIt was a beautiful serene morning and wehad a pleasent walk indeed. At the school house as wepassed sat a youth with his mind occupied with study 
 From Salt Creek Fort on the morning of the 26th we startedrode to Summit and thence to Pason where we took breakfast. We thencontinued to Palmyira but did not stop so I did not get the statistics ofthe place. At Springville we dined and then continued to Provowhere we tarried but a few minutes and thence we drove to PleasantGrove and took supper. Thence to Lake City where we did not^stop^ and on through Lehi and then to the point of the mountain wherewe camped, making the distance of our day's travel 55 miles.Pleasant Grove in 1855.Pleasant Grove was 80 rods square with a wall the same.

 understand. Therefore we could not enter into the Kingdom of GodIt is nothing but the power of God that has preserved this settlement. The Indians could have killed every man woman and child here and not a man had a gun ready to defend himselfWhen you have become of one heart and mind God has treasures for you and he has given us capacity to see if we will magnify our calling with everything we have to do in our lives. We are approaching very swiftly the time when Jesus will come to see if we are of one heart and mind which the Prophet Joseph said would be in this generation and will manifest himself to the Saints and take up his abode with them. This was said twenty one years ago and in 26 years more if we are not prepared to meet Jesus and angels we shall be wiped out and sent to hell. We are fast approaching the time.I do not care what was done in the morning of creation or the days of Noah. I want to know what this people will do. Will you be Saints and live your religion and magnify your calling in the Church[?]I will now tell this people what they should do. I will tell the Bishop in the presence of the people what to do. Bishop I tell you, go and start this wall and build it 6 feet thick and 12 or 14 feet high; Shut up every gate except two and then you can lie down in safety and an enemy cannot come upon you. If this is not the will of the Lord, I do know it is my will and you should not question any farther. God wants it done and I want it done and dont stop until you are secured and that is enough.Your stacks have been so placed that one Indian could fire all this place and others shoot you down while you are fighting the fireWhat if the people in Jackson Co. had been good and been sacrificing? What would have been the situation of the people. Why the liars and goats would have had their heads cut off but the wheat and tares had to be transplanted together in the wilderness. It was not the acts of Joseph that cassed the removal of this people. It is the people that govern and control which is the democracy of heaven. 
 preparing to take the place of his parents in the risinggeneration. This brought fresh to mind the days of myyouth. We next passed the farmhouse the dairy of whichwas so large that it required a horse mill to churn thebutter. The horse was upon the wheel churning as wepassed along. After walking a distance in the State wetook a by path and struck up a high hill. The roadwas strewed with a great variety of flowers. The top ofthe hill was soon reached where we had a beautifulview of the surrounding country. Setting ourselvesunder the shade of a chesnut tree and took a survey ofthe distant fields of grain which presented a pleasentprospect and while the birds sung their melodious noteswe bowed our head ^knees^ in prayer to the Author of everyblessing.This was the first time I was ever in theState of New Jersey and this makes the seventeenth Statein which I have been.It was a year ago this morning that I leftKirtland in company of Elder Hale to go to the Islands ofthe Sea. The Lord had prospered and in grateful remem-brance of this we blessed his name.After being refreshed by the breeze I drewmy pen and wrote in my Journal the items here recordedWe then returned to Westown much invigourated byour morning's walk and after dinner walked to Westownand appointed a meeting.Service was anounced to commence atearly candle light. It was expected that we should bedisturbed by two drunken doctors leading a company ofmen with drums fifes and other instruments. But theyattended the meeting in silence and I preached to thepeople from ##Jeremiah 31:22|Jer. 31 ch 22 v## and Elder Ball followed.I left for Farmington on the 8th of June and brother Ball took steam boat for New YorkBoth were homeward bound.After several days of fatiguing travel withan interval of one for rest I arrived at my father'shouse on the 12th 
 waiting to have an interview with the Governor and as we began toleave the ground at the break of day they descovered our campmoving and set up a hoop for us to stop. Brother Huntington theInterpreter waited until they came up and they enquired if we weremad (angry). The Interpreter answered no, and that theGovernor had presents for them for giving up the murderers ofGunnison but it was Sunday and he wished to reach the city toattend meetingWe left the point of the mountain and droveto Great Salt Lake City a distance of 25 miles by 9 o'clockThus we had made a journey to Cedar City via Sanpete and backa distance of 600 miles in less than three weeksI found my family well on my returnI received letters from my brother-in-law Ilus and manybooks and papers from Dr J M Bernhisal by the Easternmail.Nearly all the wheat crops and other vegitableswhere^ere^ eaten b ^up^ by the grasshopers throughout the Territoryas far as we went; and most of the crops and vegitables in the gardensof Great Salt Lake were destroyedOn our arrival in the city we seperated toour several homes and attended meeting in the Tabneraclein the afternoon and found the place full.

 The democracy of earth is division; and mark it: there will be a division here before long among this people.Now if you will all do right and live a holy life angels will come and visit us and stay with us all night and you will have many revelations and be happy. We know we ought to pray and would not neglect it if we loved the Lord.You may do just as you have a mind to when I am gone but I beg and beseach of you to do right. I want you to build a strong wall and be safe so that what ever comes along you may be secure; and bar your gates and be careful and dont let the devil reign in you and all will be right. God bless you and I bless you. Let us be of one heart and mind in the things that we do comprehend and then we shall be one in things we shall hereafter knowRemarks By President Kimball.It is not my place to get up to reveal anything for it is the head to convey it to the body; but it is for me to carry out his designs and do his will; for when I do the will of President Young I do the will of God and no man can get salvation unless he keeps his counsel It is his will that the city should be walled and fortified and that is my will. When I do just as he tells me I do the will of my father in heaven for he is the only man who holds the keys of salvation.When I feel reluctant to do his will I feel bad and so do you all When I do his will I can sleep in peace and my heart is consoled all the day long. This is also the case with you when you do as the Bishop tells you. Last year your improvements were all scattered about but now you are got into a smashed suckertash pie. Now go to and save yourselves against all selfishness I am going to put my property and all my wives into the Church—and then nothing can be taken out of the Church. I am going to dedicate all I have to GodWhen a man turns away from the Priesthood 
 As I drew near my native place I meditated uponhome and youthful days. Ariving I found my father stepmothersister Eunice and uncle Ozem whom I had baptized a yearbefore. We spent a season in conversation took supper andbowed our knees together around the family alter of a father'shouse. I took an evening's walk with Eunice and found hermind searching for light and truth.I spent nearly a month in my parental homeand around in my native district where I laboured withmy relatives and friends to establish a Branch of the Churchand bring them into the Covenant.Here I will close this chapter and begin a newone for the classification of important incidents in aprominant place that followed in ^quick^ succession at about thisdate of my history.CHAPTER XIII.Baptism of my Relatives. Organization of a Branchof the Church in Farmington consisting of my FatherStep-mother, Sister, Uncle, Aunts, Cousins and one other.My First born. Letter from Thomas B Marsh.My call to the Quorum of the Twelve. My journey toFar West. Death of my Brother Asahel. Dangerousillness of my wife Phebe.My father Aphek Woodruff had at timesfor many years been seeking religion and the favourof God; and for more than 20 years a numerous circleof friends had made his case a subject of prayer andpled with the Lord in his behalf. But as often asmy father had struggled for victory Satan had hinderedhim and gained the victory ^mastery^. 
 The Indian Chief made a short but spirited address which wasinterpreted by brother Huntington. The purport of his address was anexhortation to the people to give heed to the counsel of President YoungIf they would do this and keep the Spirit of the Lord he said they would not be sick and die as the wicked do but they would be healthyThe Lord is giving you great blessings in food and rament oxen cowsand horses and you should be faithful and thankful.At the prayer circle I heard several interestingletters read from our missionaries; one from Joseph F.

 he forfeits everything even his life for that is no longer his. My body is only lent to me by the Lord and I forfeit everything when I go astray. If righteousness was laid to the line it would take many heads from their shoulders and the day will be when that will be done.Now do as the Bishop tells you and not go to Salt Lake to President Young to alter this or that. Pray that this people may do right for when you dishonor the Priesthood you dishonor God. I have been told that some have said I will honor the Priesthood but I will not honor hism that holds the Priesthood; but I say you cannot honor one without honoring the otherBishop Walker is presiding here. Follow his counsel and all will be right and the blessing of God will rest upon you. Even so. AmenBenedition by Wilford Woodruff. We rode to Provo and spent the night. Next day which was Sunday the people assembled in the meeting house in two rooms. Wilford Woodruff addressed the people in one room and was followed by President Young whose sermon I reported. H. C.

 Since I had became a member of the Church ofLatter-day Saints and entered into the New and EverlastingCovenant with a Dispensation of the Gospel committedunto me I had felt a deeper interest than ever inthe salvation of my father. I had now come todeclare a message unto him and his household and toteach them words whereby they might be saved.I began to cry unto the Lord for myfather and family and the Lord showed me in anight vision that a great victory was nigh.But the Devil fell upon the whole householdwith great wrath and temptation. Some of the timeone was ready to fall back and then another andhis power also rested upon me as if to devour mebut after being confined to my bed for several hoursunder his grasp in the name of Jesus I with myfriends burst the powers of darkness.I went and stood before the people andpreached the Gospel and the Lord gave us the victoryand the time had come for the fulfilment of that partrelating to relatives ^my family^ obeying the Gospel spoken in my PatriarchalBlessing under the hands of the Patriarch Joseph.I then assembled them upon the bank ofFarmington river and led six of my friends into thewaters of baptism. They were my Father Mother my SisterEunice Aunt Anna Cossett & cousin Seth and Mr Dwight Webster aMethodist Class leader. The following was written at the timein a special page of my journal to ma[r]k this importantevent in the history of myself and family:"Great & Marvelous are thy Works O Lord"(Written upon what came to pass on the first"day of July 1838 in fulfilment of Revelation)"O God inspire my pen while I record this scene of"thy mercy and fulfilment of the blessing promised me"by the testimony of Jesus Christ.

Dominicus Carter washis first Counsellor: all the people did not vote together but2 voted against him. There was a strange Spirit inProvo and many had not the Spirit of God.We reached home on the 16th.On the 24 and 25 of July I attended the PolosophicalSociety in the Social Hall and heard till midnight themost thrilling speeches essays addresses songs music &c thatI ever heard. It was truly interesting to enjoy sucha feast of the intellect of the city. We was also addressedon Saturday evening at the Universal Scientific Societyon the subject of Phrenology ^by [blank] followed^ by Orson Pratt ^and W. Woodruff^On Saturday August the 4thThe Universal Scientific society met in the Music Halland heard an interesting lecture from Professor Orson Prattupon his descovery of the law governing the planetaryrotation.At the prayer circle on Sunday the 5thseveral missionaries were chosen to go to Texas and someGerman Swiss and Norwegan Elders to go to those of theirseveral nations in the StatesIn conversing upon various principlesPresident Young thought none would inherit this earth when 
 and John Taylor Chaplains; Edward Hunter Chief Bishop and Doctor Sprague surgeon and physicianWe rode to Nephi City and spent the night and held meeting; President Young addressed the people and I reported itInterview with Walker the Indian ChiefNext day which was Tuesday the 11th we rode to Chicken Creekand stoped and spent the night near Walker and his band. IPresident Young and his Council tried to have a talk with Walker. At first he appeared dogish and was notdisposed to talk. When we first formed our corrall within 40 rods of his camp he gathered all his warriors and made quite a display but we did not go out to meet them at the time and they turned their horses out and went into their tents.When we called upon Walker he laid down in the dirt and did not feel disposed to talk; but Brother Young manifested great patience with him even after the patience of most men would have been exhausted. He went to him and lifted him out of the dirt and finally got him to talk some. The following is a Synopsis of the conversation with WalkerHe said he had no spirit. He had no heart. Did not feel as though he could talk. "And when I heard that President Young was coming I felt that I had no heart. I do not want to talk. I want to hear President Young talk and then sit still and hear others talk.President Young gave him some tobacoco. he said when he had plenty of tobacco than all his friends would come in and smoke with him but when he was out of tobacco they would not come to see himGovernor Young said I have brought some beef cattle for you.

 into the New Covenant with me. Without shame I have declaredthe Gospel to them. They felt that God had sent me and thatthey must obey.The day had come. From my father's house Iand my friends started to the appointed place, bending our way towards theriver to attend to the sacred ordinance of baptism. The spotwas reached! We stood upon the river's bank! Nature spread herfields of pleasing green and the Sun shed forth his goldenrays to gladden the earth while the silver stream was rollingat my feet and seemed to say I am ready for the Master'sservice.With feelings better imagined than describedI dwelt upon the scene and cast my eyes upon the audiencewhile we sung praises to the God of IsraelWho would not have bowed the kneewhile offering the sacrifice of the heart and imploring theblessing of Heaven that the Spirit might pervade the watersand rest upon the candidates?As from our knees we arose I enteredthe watery element and asked who was ashamed of the bedwhere Jesus lay. Many eyes were turned to behold thescene as my father followed me into the water and deepsolemnity rested upon their countenances.I took my father by the hand while hecovenanted to walk with God; and for the remission of his sinsI baptized him. Feeling the victory won, my mother followedhis footsteps.Eunice my sister my only sister was ready. Thegarb of pride had been rent and now fearless of the world's despisingshe next entered the waters of baptism and thus followed herDivine Master.For the consolation of Israel Aunt Anna hadlong looked and now she rejoiced that she could the ancient pathpersue while upon her example and upon the holy scene heryoung daughters gazed and seemed to say O Lord prepare us likewiseto do thy will.Seth in his early youth was not too young toserve his God and he desired to follow the example of hisfather mother and brother whom I baptized a year before. 
 it became celestialized and translated into the presence of God exceptingthose who would be crowned as Gods and be able to endure the fulnessof the presence of God excepting that they might take with them someservants for whom they would be held responsible. All others wouldhave to inherit another kingdom even that kingdom agreeing to the lawswhich they had kept. Yet he thought these also would have theprivilege of proving themselves worthy and advancing to a celestial glorybut it would be a slow process.I attended the Universal Scientific Society atthe Social Hall. Brother Frederick Mitchel addressed the Assemblyand was followed by David Candalme^land^. Brother Mitchel's addresson Utah as she was is and is to be was an excellent one. OrsonPratt addressed us on the Saturday evening upon the organizationof worlds.On the second Sunday ^the 19th^ from this Orson Pratt preachedupon the origin and organization of our plurality systemParley P.

 a feast while we are hereWalker wanted to have the Mormons sing before the parties took a smoke. He said E. T. Benson came and his heart was good but D. Huntington came and his heart was runningWe then sung and when we had this was done Walker again spoke and said I have not got the Spirit of the Lord and if there is any one here that can give me the Spirit of the Lord I wish they would do it. He said white people in heaven were happy.Tulpidge next spoke amid much crying and tears He was the Indian who had his wife-squaw killed. He said D. Huntington had been good to him and he had not seen him since his child died. He said they had not got good hearts and the Mormons' hearts were now good who were here. We have now good peace and can all lie down in peace without fear and I want to live in friendship with this peopleWe left the Indian Camp and returned to our waggons But President Young had another talk with Walker this day. I was not present and Thomas Bullock reportedOn the following day we again visited Walker at his tent. He was still in the same unpleasant mood and did not wish to talk and he left his tent and went into the willows, and others talked. The Indians had a sick child and they wished the Elders to lay hands up it. Then President Kimball Bensonand Wells laid hands upon it and administered to it. Dr Spraguealso left some medicine for it and for others who were sickThe Indian said if the child died he should have to kill an Indian child or a Mormon child to go with it. (This is their tradition). The interpreter told him he must not do it—that it was wrong; that when Mormon children died we did not kill any child to go with them and they must not do it for it was not right. The Indian said his heart was not so. He wanted to kill some one to go with him. He said he wanted his child to get well and then he would go with us

He said Walker was a great chief and President Young was a great chief and that wahat he said was true and that he could not say anything wrongPetetnet spoke and said they would be good and not kill anybody mand not steal and that one could go alone and not be killed and that there would be not blood in their pathWalker wished President Young to write a letter so that he could show it to the people and let them know that we were at peace so that there would be no difficulties with the people President Young wrote one and Dr Sprague gave medicine to the sick child and gave Walker directions how to deal with it and with the others who were sick.On parting with Walker and his tent he said we now understood each other. That they were now to have all peace so all could go on the road in peace and not be afraid; they could not put in wheat and corn and one alone without somebody killing them. He now wanted to have the road clear without any blood in it. He wished for peace all the time. President Young and Walker shook hands and then all the company shook hands and the pipe of peace was smokedWalker received his presents and killed a beef for the Indians to have a feast. They also traded,—swaped blankets for horses and bought two children who were prisonersAfter we had made peace and got through trading We left Walker's camp and rode to the Severe Walker Gruspephene Squash-head with many others went with us and we spent the night at the Severe.

 and viewed the river and pleasant fields and partook of some buriesby the way side. This was my last walk with my sister atthis ^time^ for on the morrow I left Farmington for my wife's father'sAfter evening prayers father retired to rest and Ispent a season in conversation with mother. We felt sensibly theweight of the powers of temptation that try the souls of menbut out of which the Lord delivers his Saints. I also spenta short time with sister Eunice before retiring and we mingledour sympathies tears and prayers together before a throneof grace.I arose in the morning refreshed by sleep andafter once more partaking of the bounties of earth around thefamily and bowing before the Lord and offering up ourmorning sacrifice I took the parting hand of my fathermother and sister Eunice and once more bid adieu to mynative place.I arrived in Boston on the 5th and tookthe steam boat Portland at 7 p.m. and started for the cityof Portland. In the morning we saw a Spanish flag ofdistress at sea. We approached her and found her to be ^thewreck of^ a Spanish brig. They had been wrecked about 10 daysbut all the crew was on board and no lives lost. Wetowed her into Portland.We arrived at 8 a.m. and after takingbreakfast with my brother-in-law Ezra Carter I visitedsome book stores and purchased an Album for MrsWoodruff.I then walked to Scarborough and hadthe pleasure of again greeting my wife and friends inpeace and prosperity.Some days after this I received aninteresting letter from Elder Jonathan Hale in whichhe stated that Joseph was in Missouri and receivingthe word of the Lord dailyBirth of a DaughterSarah Emma WoodruffJuly 14th 1838.

She was born athalf past 5 o'clock in the morningMy wife continued to be favoured and Iremained with her until the 30th a portion of the timeengaged in manual labour.On this day I started for the Islands again andarrived there on the 7th of August.

 and F T. Whitney I rode horseback to Cedar City 20 miles and on our arrival I went to the Iron Works and examined all the premises and saw several pigs of native iron. Erastus Snow explained to me the difficulties they had to encounter in making iron which I found to be many. We held a meeting in the ^evening^ President Young preached and I reported his discourse. It is in the Historian's OfficeNext day again in company with brothers Steel and Whitney I rode 6 miles to Summit Creek. The previous Summer there were 12 houses here which were removed during the Indian war but the fort was standing. From thence we rode 6 miles farther to the Summit of the Great Basin and then 7 miles farther to Battle Creek.Here we had splendid mountain senery of red rocks standing like pyramids 1000 feet high. Opposite this cite was a fFort Harmony to be located 6 miles from the base of the mountain on the East, the fort on the West. We then rode to the present location of Fort Harmony which by the rodeometer was 287 miles from Salt Lake CityThis was a good grazing country and splendid mountain Scenery. The brethren were trying to take out the stream of water called Ash Creek to water their farming land. They had carried it 6 miles and had to carry it 62 miles farther to carry it on to their new field which they were making. The missionaries who were sent out the last Winter from Salt Lake had donethis. Rufus Allen was their captain. John D. Lee had the charge of their old fort.Fort Harmony was 15 miles from the Rio VirginI went fishing but caught nothing though it was said there were some small trout in the Creek 
 The missionaries were appointed to their respective Districts andthe Conferences arranged: Conference at Provo on the 26th of October for theFirst District.

Kington I rodeto Farmington Davis County to attend the quarterly Conferenceof that District to commence on the 20thAfter retiring to bed I prayed to the Lordto show me what we should teach the people and I receivedfor an answer, "Let my servants obtain the Holy Ghost and keepmy Spirit with them and that will instruct them what to teachthe people continually. Instruct the people to keep my Spiritwith them and they will be enabled to understand the word of theLord when it is taught themQuarterly ConferenceAt FarmingtonOctober the 20th 1855.Saturday morning at 10 o'clock the people in the 1st District 
 Know then Brother Woodruff by this that you are appointedto fill the place of one of the Twelve Apostles and that it isagreeable to the word of the Lord given very lately that you shouldcome speedily to Far West and on the 26th of April next to takeyour leave of the Saints here and depart for other climes acrossthe mighty deep!Yours in the love of GodThomas B. Marsh.Wilford Woodruff.Notwithstanding the threats of the people to mob tarfeather and kill me if I came there again I was determinedto visit once more the Saints upon the Islands of the SeaThe next few days was occuppied in carrying out this designI also had a short interview with Mr Douglass the MethodistPriest and his countenance indicated the wrath of his heartOn the 13th of August I gave my last farewelto the Islands and started for my father-in-law's whereI arrived on the 20th.The last day of summer I rode in companywith Mrs Woodruff and sister Rhoda F Scamman to thebeach on the sea shore. We spent an hour riding uponthis beautiful beach extending along the shore for about sevenmiles in length and one hundred rods in wedth at lowwater. It is composed of fine white sand, is almost a deadlevel and very easy and pleasent to ride or walk upon.The sun shone brilliantly upon the face ofnature the canvas of the gallant ships were filled with themorning breeze as they sailed upon the great deep; waveafter wave reached the extent of their bounds upon the shoreand then rolled back to their source again. These togetherwith other varieties made the morning's excursion very pleasent.After picking up a quantity of sea shells to carryto the land of Zion for domestic uses and in memory ofthe place we returned to Mr Scamman's and after visitingothers of the brethren we reached Father Carter's having beenduring the day a distance of 20 miles. 
 I then went on to the top of the Kanyon through which runs Ash Creek. Thomas Bullock and Samuel Atwood were with me. In about 2 hours we rolled into the Kanyon about 1000 feet below about 50 tons of rock. We rolled off one which would weigh about 5 tons. It fell about 200 feet and struck a shaft of rock and took it with it and falling into the Creek 800 feet below sent a sheet of water about fifty feet into the air. We made a good deal of thunder for awhile After wearying ourselves of this we returned to the fortOn our return we found the people assembled in meeting. President Young had spoken and also Parley P. Pratt neither of which I heard. President Kimball was speaking when I came in and Lorenzo Young followed and the Spirit of God was upon him and he prophesied many thingsThere was no report of any part of the meeting only T. D. Brown's minutes of President Young's speech which he gave me and it is with our reports in the Historian's OfficeThomas Bullock and myself reported all the President's sermons when we were present as we were appointed Historian and clerk of the Camp.Next day we rode back on the bench on our return home 3 miles and the company stoped and President Young located the new fort groungd to be called Fort Harmony Thomas Bullock took an account of it in his Journal. The location was good and there was a great quantity of grass and good soil. We rode to the Creek and nooned and thence to Cedear CityAbout 20 miles south of the Rio Virgin ^Fort Harmony^ we descend rapidly a long distance into another climate on the Rio Virgin. There was a kind of fruit there coveringthousands of acres which was very choice. Its flavor was between a strawbury and cranbury. William C. Stainshad some of it growing in his garden 
 assembled in quarterly Conference at Farmington. There werepresent of the Twelve Apostles Parley P. Pratt Orson Prattand Wilford Woodruff; and of other missionaries Lorenzo D YoungGilbert Clements T. D. Brown and Richard CookAll the missionaries present had a coldand a sore throat and they were all hoarse. It had comeon during the last 24 hours and it was a complaint that wasquite general among the people. Many hundreds men womenand children were atctact^k^ed in the same way. There was no change in the weather nor anything on the outward appearanceof the elements to cause this general complaintElder Parley P. Pratt was quite unwellHe said he had not intended to preach this forenoon; buthe had to preach or go to bed. So he delivered a very interesting discourse to the Conference for the space oftwo hours and a half upon the birth life death andresurrection of Jesus Christ. He took for his textthe ##Luke 2:10-11|10th and 11th verses of the II Chapter of St Luke##"And the angel said unto them fear not for behold Ibring you good tidings of great joy which shall beunto all people for unto you is born this day in thecity of David a Saviour which is Christ the Lord."Parley P. Pratt in opening his discoursegave some practical lessens upon the training of our childrenin the history and knowledge of the Bible. He saidthat one cause why he had taken that text was that a schoolteacher in Great Salt Lake City had asked her whole schoolwhere Jesus was born and not one of them could tell her. Heobserved however that the children were small; but he urgedupon the Saints the importance of instructing even the smallestchildren capable of understanding the history of the Prophets and Apostles. He said by way of illustr[a]tion that every 
 September came and I soon began daily to makepreperations to leave the State of Main and our friendsand relatives in Scarborough to lead a company of Saintsfrom the Islands of the sea to the land of Zion inFar West. My wife and child were to accompany meIt was the greatest trial Phebe ever had topass through, to take the parting hand of her parentskindred and neighbours perhaps for the last time andto go a journey of two thousand miles late in the fallwith our baby in the first stage of the [w]hooping coughAdd to this also that she was to leave a kind father'shouse of plenty and go to a new country and settleamong strangersThese matters dwelt upon my wife's mindand the persuasion of friends was also against her journeyunder the trying circumstances. In fact it seemed attimes as though earth and hell were combined to crushher troubled spirit and the sequel of our journey willshow that all this was like foreshadowings of that whichfollowed on our wayI cryied unto the Lord that she mightbe supported under these and all other trials and Isoon found that the same Spirit which hadinspired her to embrace the fulness of the Gospeland forsake her friends to go a journey of one thousandmiles to enjoy the society of the Saints—the spirit whichhad also united her heart and hand to me and ledher to accompany me to the Islands of the sea waswith her still!Yes Phebe possessed too much firmness andfaith and confidence in God to put her hand tothe plough and then look back or to wholy giveway to trials however great. Like Ruth she wasdetermined to forsake kindred and country for my sakeand the cause in which we are engagedAs I beheld the spirit in her daily walk—rooted in her heart and beaming in her countenancemy whole soul was bound to her in love stronger thandeath such as we only feel in such circumstances. 
 A Ceder City Next day ^which^ was Sunday. E. T. Benson and Parley P. Pratt preached and I reported and afterwards we rode to Parowan and held meeting with the Saints there in the Council House. President Young preached and I reported itWe left Parowan next day on our return to Great Salt Lake City.We were at Salt Creek on the 26th and held meeting as we had also at other places on the way and at night I attended the trial of Bishop Haywood which lasted till midnight. T. Bullockand Wilford Woodruff reported and our reports are in the Historians OfficeWe started in the morning from Salt Creek and rode West across the mountains and made a new road. After 20 miles travel we nooned at the Fort at the foot of the mountain The mountain was quite steep and stoneny over which we had come and we nooned in sight of Utah Lake. In the afternoon we drove to the bottom of the mountain beside the Utah Lake on the West side and camped for the night. We had twenty five men from Nephi City with us to help us make a road.May 30th we left Lehi and drove to Unionville where we made a short hault. Bishop Richards had prepared a good dinner for us but the company did not wish to stop so near home: So President Young told them to eat what they wanted and give the rest to the poorWe then rode on to Great Salt Lake City having travelled in 26 days 594 miles being 287 to Harmony and the same backOn the 10th of June I rode to Fort Herriman with Mrs Woodruff Emma and Bulah and soon after our arrivalGeorge A. Smith and E. T. Benson came. We none of us had ever visited the place before. I thought this the last location in the Territory for a herd ground 
 child in these valleys knew at 8 years of age that it was necessarythat it should be baptized at that period of its life, because it hadbeen taught it by their parents and others. But, he said, was it notfor the name of Jesus Christ all our ordinances and administrationswould be of non effect and therefore our children should be thoroughlytaught concerning Jesus and his history.In the afternoon Gilbert Clements preachedand in the evening T. D Brown.On the Sunday Orson Pratt delivered an ablediscourse upon the coming of Christ and read a revelation, fromthe ##Doctrine and Covenants 49:22-23|Doctrine and Covenants##, given through Joseph the Prophet toParley P. Pratt and others:"Jesus Christ will not come in the form ofa woman, nor like a man walking upon the face of the earthbut look forth for the heavens to be shaken and the mountainsto be laid low &c"Orson Pratt after reading this revelation tous then spoke of the work to be done previous to the comingof Christ; also the first delivery of the Priesthood to Joseph Smithby the Angel John the Baptist, the building up of the NewJerusalem the Angels flying through the midst of the heavensand the sounding of the trumpets as spoken of by John theRevelator and the great day of the Lord's coming.I have recorded a synopsis of this Discourse in myJournal.In the evening Elder Wilford Woodruff addressedthe congregation. Among other things he said:"I am truly thankful that I have a missionappointed me and in connection with Parley Pratt and OrsonPratt two of the Twelve Apostles for it is the first time sincethe organization of this Church and quorum that I have hadthis privilege of being associated together with these two men 
 The devil had never tempted me to cease from doingthe will of God in not gathering to Zion or to cease travellingand preaching the Gospel. I was therefore not inclined to stayand enjoy the Society of my friends and kindred for in stayingI should have both ruined them and myself as touching theKingdom of God.Father and mother Carter and all my wife's brothersand sisters had been uncommonly attentive and generous tous during a year past but they could not see the proprietyof our gathering with the Saints. But we dared not letthis be an hinderance and I could only pray to God thatthey might be brought to understanding and not lose theirreward for their great kindness to us.I spent the 12th at Father Carter's packingup the last remnants of our goods and on the next dayPhebe's father gave us one hundred dollars for whichsum we both signed a document to the effect that wewere satisfied and would hold no further claim toany of his real estate or personal propetyAbout this time my mind was in suspencebecause the camp of Saints did not arrive from theIslands and I had not heard anything by letter fromthem for some time past. The sickness of our babe alsowas an anxiety to usOn the 18 and 21st I received letters. Inthe latter brother Thomas informed me that the campwould be ready to start in a few days. He wished meto pray God to deliver them and enable them to go outof Babylon. Truly it was a day of trial all round tothose who were seeking to go up unto Zion.Several days afterwards I saw a report inthe Portland Transcript against the Mormons in DavisCo. Mo. which grew out of the fact that our brethrenclaimed their privilege as American citizens and cast theirvotes at an election. Numbers were rising up among theGentiles in the different counties to go over to Davis Coand mob the Saints. All these reports had a tendencyto dampen the minds of those who were about to startfor the bosom of the Church. But none of these matters 
 The following day was Sunday and George A Smith E. T. Benson and myself preached to the people upon the subject of walling in their city and schooling their children; and at the close of the meeting we returned to Great Salt Lake CityOn the next day President Young gave a party at the Social Hall to the company who went South with him and it continued till midnightOn the 14th we had a hard rain storm and a great deal of heavy hail fell. One child was drowned and another nearly killed A cloud broke and the water came down in torrents. It washed away much of the city wall and much damage was done to houses and gardens. On little Cottonwood the hail cut everything down Gardens corn and wheat were destroyed. It was also the same at North Cottonwood. Nearly all the glass was broken out of the windowsWith Mrs Woodruff and most of my family the next day I drove my waggon to South Weber Fort and we spent the night at brother Kington's with whom I spent the following day and preached to the people upon the subject of walling in their city and educating their children; and to the sisters I spoke about forming a female society to make clothing to clothe the Indian woman and childrenReturning to Great Salt Lake City next day we nooned at brother Ezra Clark's and I saw his carriage (top and sides) was cut to pieces with the hail. Hail there fell as large as a small hen's egg. We rode through one hail drift two feet deep washed by the water down the creekOn the Sunday Orson Spencer and Orson Hyde preached in the forenoon and in the afternoon Elder Thomas Bullock gave an account of his mission to the ShushoneesOn the Monday President Young and company 
 on a preaching mission only as we have met in Conferences fromtime to time to transact business as a quorum"I returned home and spent the week. AQuarterly Conference was held at Provo on the 27th and 28th byParley P. and Orson Pratt and othersIn company with Parley and Orson Pratt on the1st of November I rode to South Weber and we did notarrive till a late hour. It was very dark. We got lostin the bluffs and came very near running our carriage off asteep bluff. I went to the fort got a pilot and lanternand we arrived in safety. The people were assembledfor a meeting. I spoke to them for a short time andspent the night with Orson Pratt at brother Kington's.Next day we rode to Ogden City and metwith the people in the capacity of a quarterly Conference.We had a strong wind through the dayand night. It was the strongest gale we ever experiencedin these valleys. Much damage was done and manyadobie houses were blown down some unrofofed fences laidprosterate carriages and waggons mashed to pieces hay and straw stacks blown over and many chimneys blown offNext morning the people were gloomy inconsequence of the destruction by the wind which also continuedstrong through that day and until the next which was SundayI reported all the discourses of the Eldersat the Ogden Conference. I left Parley Pratt preaching inthe afternoon of Sunday and rode to South Weber where Ipreached in the evening to the peopleIn company with Joseph Young HoraceEldridge and Henry Herriman I rode to Tooele City tohold conference. There were others of the missionariesattening this Conference which continued several days 
 started to explore and make a road through Touille and around the West MountainI spent the following week in the Historian's Office with George A Smith and T. Bullock in drawing off the sermons and teachings of the Presidency and TwelveAnniversary of the DeathofJoseph and Hyrum SmithJune the 27, 1854Ten years ago this day Joseph and Hyrum Smith was ^were^ martyred in Carthage jail; and on this day the Church held a special Conference in Great Salt Lake City according to the adjournment at the General April ConferenceThe Conference opened at 10 o'clock and there were present the Presidency the Twelve the various quorums of the Church and a large congregation.In the morning President Young preached one of the most interesting discourses and in the afternoon Elder John Taylor gave an interesting and very minute description of the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum and all the circumstances leading to that solemn event in our history.Conference continued during the next day and President Heber C. Kimball delivered a long address.The following persons received missions abroad:John Taylor of the Twelve to New York and with him N. H. Felt A Robins R Clinton M. H. Peck and Abel Lamb; John Young to the U. S.; Leman Brown to Michigan; Preston Thomas to Texas Elder Tripp to the same place; Elder White to Ohio and Joseph Cregg to Ireland.A very important nomination was also made 
 moved me in my determinationThe next day this article in the paper wentthe rounds of the time among our friends and neighboursThey said it would not do for us to go ^and^ for that we shouldbe killed &c if we did goThese fears formed no part of my trialsyet at no part of my time since I had joined the Churchwas I subject to more care and suspence than now.Yet I was never stronger in the faith.But the case stood with me thus: TheLord had commanded me to go to Zion spedily and whileI was setting myself about the undertaking the Devil andhis agents were using their combined extertions to hinderme. I had been waiting for the Saints from theIslands of the sea to accompany them until it wasvery late in the season; the fFall rains were upon usand cold weather would soon set in and the minds ofthe Saints around me were cast down and depressedWe had a dreary journey of two thousand miles beforeus with no other prospect than to camp upon the coldand damp ground. I had also a sick infant of onlytwo months old to take with me and my wife whosespirits at times felt severly the circumstances around us;and when she suffered I suffered also. But thank Godshe stood the trial like a brave womanThese were some of the things that made meanxious at the time but I was determined to make thejourney before another Spring even if it was alone and onfoot and I had to b[u]y my bread by the way.On the 28th I received a letter from brotherNathaniel Thomas in Camden in which he said "We arealmost ready, and shall start to-morrow morning." Thischeered us.Some days, however, passed before they arrivedand on the 3rd of October Elder Townsend started to look afterthem and see why they did not get along.On the next day at 2 p.m. our anxiety wasreleived for the camp came in sight and I immediatelyaccompanied them to Sister Foss' house where a busy scene ensued.

 We immediately commenced nailing and painting thewagon covers and preparing them against stormy weather. I discoveredthat the company needed a leader. I laboured with them untilnight and then returned to Father Carter's. It was an affecting timeto Phebe as she was about to part from all her relatives.We spent most of the ^next^ day in painting and preparingour waggons for the journey.At about 2 o'clock p.m. we bid our friends and relativesfarewell. Many tears were shed; but Mrs Woodruff manifested greatfortitude in parting from her father mother family and friendsAfter our farewell to these and many of the neighbours whowere present I made a commencement to lead this campof Saints on their long journey.Our company consisted of the following persons:From South Fox Island brother Charles Brown and family;from North Fox Island Nathaniel Thomas and family;brother Ephraim Luce and family, Cyrus Sterrett andfamily, Ebenezer Carver and family and a young man bythe name of Alonzo Thurstin; from Camden Daniel Whitleyand family; from Scarborough Elder James Townsend andfamily and I with my wife and child.The whole numbered 53 persons. We had withus ten waggons and nineteen horses.After being set in order we travelled 13 milesto Kenebunk and camped for the night by a saw mill andas we were not fully organized there was some bustle amongstus at first.It was for a moment a trial to my feelingsto take my wife with an infant at her breast into a coldtent to sleep upon the ground; but after we had becomereconciled to it there was an invitation given her to spendthe night at a house which was accepted.I laid down upon the bed I spread in the tentand after two hours I got up to stand on guard. I sat upthe remainder of the night built a fire and by its light wrotein my journal.On the third day we arrived at brother Holmes'and spent the next day, Sunday, there when we fully orgainizedour company and I was chosen their leader. Milton Holmes 
 We reached Filmore the capitol of the Territory onthe 7th of DecemberOn the Sunday at the City Hall Parley P. Prattpreached. He gave an account of his travels through this countryin the dead of Winter in deep snows to Iron County before therewas any settlement; and then he took up the comming forthof the Book of Mormon. I met in council with the Presidencyand Twelve on the welfare of the TerritoryThe Legislative AssemblyIts first Session at FilmoreDecember the 10th 1855On this day the Legislative Assembly met for the firsttime in the State House at Filmore. Both hHousesorganized and adjournedNext day I met with the Council atone o'clock and at 2 o'clock we met in joint session. TheGovernor appeared and delivered his Message. Onethousand copies of it was ordered to be printed and itwas resolved that one hundred copies of the Minutes of eachday should be printed for the benefit of the two housesThe Secretary Almon W. Babbit arose and insulted theAssembly to a great degree by threatening that their billsshould not be paid if they printed that number, andhe wished to dictate to the Assembly what they shoulddo which was out of his provinceThe Governor arose and gavethe Sectretary a severe lashing with his tongue and saidhe ought to be kicked out of the house as a poor miserabledog. 
 that day. We were all glad to meet with him; but he was too weary to stay long with us.Sunday the 3rd of September Orson Pratt spoke to the people upon his mission to the States; and on the following Sunday he spoke upon the Law of Consecration; and on the Sunday after President Young preached upon the Law of ConsecrationIn our Prayer Circle on Sunday the 17th the subject came up in conversation concerning Orson Pratt publishing the "Seer" and the doctrines in itPresident Young said brother Orson ought not to have published the marriage ceremony. It was sacred and oneof the last ceremonies attended to in the endowments and ought not to have been given to the worldBrother Pratt said he thought it was no harm as the plurality of wives and its doctrines were to be published to the world and he should not have done it had he thought there had been the least harm in it.President Young said he was satisfied that brother Pratt intended no wrong in it. He also said that the doctrine taught in the Seer that God had arrived at that state where he could not advance any farther in knowledge power and glory was a false doctrine and that there never will be a time to all eternity when all the Gods of eternity will ceacse to advance in power knowledge experience and glory for if this was the case eternity would cease to be and the glory of God would come to an end. Celestial beings will continue to advance in knowledge and power worlds without end Joseph would always be ahead of us. We should never catch up with him in all eternity nor he with his leaders.Brother Pratt also thought that Adam was made out of the dust of the earth and he could not believe that Adamwas our God and the Father of Jesus ChristPresident Young said that he was and that he 
 was to accompany us and he was appointed our ComOn the next day we continued our journey travelled15 miles and camped in a beautiful medowFill up the interval from October 9 to Nov 2with the journey and casualities of camp life includinga severe attack of something like the colera upon myselfand the sickness of several children one of whom afterwardsdied.At this date our company began to seperateElder M. Holmes took steam boat at Buffalo for Fairportand after another day's travel brother Cyrus Sterrett andhis family and brother Wahitley and family returned to thecity of Buffalo to spend the winter as the expence wasso great it was thought we could not all get to Zion. Sothey stoped to labour and brother Thomas let them havea span of horses and a waggon to help them up inthe Spring.Here it should be observed that in the verystarting of this company Nathaniel Thomas had cheerfullysteped forward to the assistance of the poor and investedabout 1000 dollars for waggons horses tents &c to fit outthis company while others who possessed this world's goodsalso, drew back and did not go with the poor lest theyshould be under the necessity of assisting.Journing onward to the 143th and wewere at Painsville where the Saints had been much persecutedFrom this place the next day brother Townsend walkedto Kirtland to see brother Milton HolmesWe rested on the 15th on account of rainbut journeyed to Mantauway on the following day andspent the night at the Inn of Lewis Turner. Elders Holmesand Townsend were with us again but Milton had madeup his mind not to go any further with us but to tarryin Kirtland or in the regions around until the SpringWhile at Kirtland brother Holmes had seenseveral letters from Far West representing that there wasgreat trouble among the Saints caused by the inhabitants ofMissouri coming against them with armed force.Next day, we left brother M. Holmes and 
 Babbit followed and said he had as good a right to occupythe Governor's seat as the Governor himself and made use of muchinsulting language.The Assembly then resolved that the freedom of thehouse should be withheld from Secretary Almon W. Babbit. TheSecretary threatened to take all the money and return to Salt Lake Cityand pay no more expences of the Legislature. He was underthe influence of liquorBabbit started for the city next morning. Hefelt better however and did not take away the funds belonging tothe Legislature as he threatedned. I sent letters by him to mywife son Wilford and daughter Phebe.The Legislature continued its sessionsSynopsisofA Discourse Delivered by President Brigham YoungIn FilmoreSunday December the 16th 1855.His test [text] was"Arise and shine O Zion for thy light is comeand the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee." [##Isaiah 60:1##]I have always felt since I have beencalled to preach to speak of the practical things of every daylife instead of some great mysteries along way ahead ineternity which the people do not know and never will as thethings taught do not exist.I felt in the beginning of my ministrythat I had no right to preach unless I was filled with theSpirit of revelation and prophecy as the ancients; and Ifeel the same to-day 
 came from another world and made this brought Eve with him partook of the fruits of the earth begat children and they were earthly and had ^mortal^ bodies and if we were faithful we should become Gods as he was. President Young told brother Pratt to lay asside his philosophical reasoning and get revelation from God to govern him and enlighten his mind more and it would be a great blessing to him. He also told him to lay aside his books and go into the Kanyons as some of the rest of us and it would be better for him; and he said that Brother Pratt's philosophy injured him in a measure.The President made many more remarks worthy of note. He said that we all should grow up in revelation so that principle would govern every act of our lives. He had never found any difficulty in leading the people since Joseph's deathGeneral Conference of The Church held in the Tabernacle G. S. L. CityOct 6th 1854.The Presidency were present and of the Twelve Apostles Orson Hyde Parley P. ^Orson^ Pratt Wilford Woodruff George A. Smith E. T. Benson and Lorenzo Snow. The rest of the quorums of the Church was present as usual.[blank space] 
 continued our journey without any particular incident for the intervalof three days at which date we were brought to another seperationOn the 20th we made arrangements to further devideour little company, as brothers Thomas and Townsend w[ere] inclinedto stop by the way and winterOur company was truly getting very small there being nowonly brothers Luce Brown and myself and our families to continueour way together but we felt united in spirit and determinedto go onwardThat night we had a comfortable room at a Inn 7 milesfrom Worster. We were by ourselves for the night; and while sittingby the fire side Sister Lydia Luce related a dream that shehad on the night before. It was as follows:She saw a small sun in the South and whilelooking at the strange phenomenon there appeared a ring of bloodin the West. There also appeared directly several other ringsof blood of a larger size all encircling each other, forminga ring within a ring. Soon following this a ladder of fire was seenblazing in the heavens and it fell to the earth and broke intotwo peaces. One part of the ladder had an iron plate fastenedto the end of it with something also attached to it. She saidthat in her dream I went and picked it up and read itand it contained the ##Isaiah 15|XV. Chapter of Isaiah##. By readingthis chapter it will be seen that this ^is^ very typical of whathas to befall this Gentile nation in particular and the worldin general in the last days.As we travelled along we were continually hearingof the Mormon war as it was called and the inhabitants ofMissouri were persecuting and puting the Saints to death becauseof their religionOn the 23rd Phebe was attacked with a severehead ache which terminated in the brain fever. Still wetravelled on daily though my wife suffered much from thejourney.The first day of winter was a pleasent one asfar as the season of the year was concerned; but O the winterof sorrow was trying to seize upon my soul. Our companywas much afflicted.It was December the first and as we journeyed 
 In order to be quallified to preach we shouldbe filled with revelation. I do not consider that any manis qualified to preach the Gospel and sayings of the Prophetsunless he is filled with the Spirit of the ProphetsWe are commanded to arise and shinebut for us to sit down and say we believe in this work, webelieve that Joseph was a Prophet and still not carryout the work which we are commanded to do; not to buildup and beautify Zion we shall find that we shall missour aim, we shall not enter into the celestial Kingdomwe shall not enter through through the gatesWe must show to the Lord thatwe are willing to fulfil what he requires of us and thiswe shall not do unless we are willing to arise andshine. But how are we to do it? We havegot to build up Zion, we have got to make Zionthe most holy and polished refined and beautifulplace upon the face of the whole earthSome may expect to see Zionin all that beauty majesty and glory which God hasspoken of; but the people do not understand the thingsof God. I will prophesy that unless this people willarise and build up Zion as God has commanded themthey will be removed out of their place and another peoplewill be raised up in their stead who will perform the workand this I will say in the name of God. I also say inthe name of the Lord that the descendants of Ephraim whoare among the Gentiles are the first born and they are thefirst ones to receive the fulness of the Gospel in thisDispensation; they are the first to be gathered togetherand this work was not to be given to any other. Inthe beginning of the Kingdom of God this has been done 
 [blank space]I raised this year 369 bushels of wheat and 400 bushels of potatoes and 200 bushels of cornMy Mission to The Saints in the NorthOn the 27th of November I started on a mission to the Saints in the North of the TerritoryThe first place I visited was Session's Settlement but I did not preach to the people for they were holding Court in the School house to settle a difficulty with a gGentile. Bishop Stoker was the Bishiop of SessionsNext day I was at Farmington and held a good meeting with the people. They were making many improvements. They had a Court House built and many good buildings going up. Bishop Brownel presided over Farmington.On the following day I rode to Bishop Kay'ssettlement and found the people doing ^well^ and on the next I visited South Weber over which Elder Kington was BishopThis was the last day of NovemberI was at North Weber Dec. 1st where I preached to the people and and spent the night with Bishop Abiah Wadsworth who presided there 
 we passed brother Thomas by the wayside mending his wagonthat had broken down. Brother Townsend was quite sick.I had not passed this afflicted company but a fewmiles before I was called to stop my horses for the purpose toall appearence to allow my wife—my companion to breathe herlast and resign her spirit into the hands of the God whogave it. I stoped the wagon in the street where tothose around it seemed that her death couch stood. Butwhile two of our sisters were standing by her side towitness the scene of her last moments the Lord was verymerciful for notwithstanding that it seemed that breathhad left her body and her spirit departed she revivedagain. I then drove the horses a few rods further andput up at an Inn in EatonHere I stayed the night taking care of Phebeand the babe. Earnestly did I pray the Lord tospare the life of my wife.The next day was Sunday December 2ndIt was absolutely necessary to discontinue our journey andI concluded that for awhile we would tarry until Phebe hadrecovered her health in some degree or departed this lifeThis settled and the next part was toremove from the In for our circumstance would not permitour remaining there. I therefore carried her into the wagonand drove two miles to the house of Mr McKenzieand put up not knowing how long we should have totarry for Phebe felt as though she only had a breathof life remaining.During the day brother Thomas and hislittle afflicted company passed us again. The childwhom I have already mentioned who died on the roadwas a daughter of brother Thomas. Elder Townsendwho was travelling with him was now also sick.After getting my wife and things into thehouse and my horse put out I devoted myself to the takingcare of my wife.In the evening she called me to her bedsideand said that she felt as though a few moments morewould end her existence in this life 
 The Ephraimites are before me tohere to day. Now if Iwas ^were^ to ask you if you are willing to do as you are told you would say"Yes." But let me tell you there is not one of you who iswilling to do as you are told.I have given the people counsel for years passhow to build their forts walls cities houses and to begin to beautifyand adorn Zion; but have the people done as I have told themin these things. You may say these are of minor consequencesbut let me tell you that if you are not willing to do the smallthings that are necessary on earth then you are not willing to do as you are told in heaven and you will lose yourglory and exaltationNow do you not remember that I told you years ago to go to and build up a beautiful city inthis place but there has been but little done towards it. Wehave many who have been in the Church for quite anumber of years and yet we have not a builder or architectwho knows enough to build the meanest house not evena kitchen in the New Jerusalem. Then how canwe build up the New Jerusalem? I have told thepeople all the day long to be prepared to build up thiscity; and I will say that if we could take all the knowledgethat exist among every nation upon the face of the wholeearth and boil it down into an essence and put it all intoone man he would not know enough to lay the first stone ^in thewall^ around the New Jerusalem to say nothing about buildingthe city and TempleWe have got to improve continually andbuild up good cities and adorn and beautify Zion andlet me tell you that if you do not come to thatplace where you will not set your heart on anyriches or gold you are not worthy to do the work of 
 On the 2nd I was at Ogdan. This was the first time I had ever visited the place. I found it a large settlement. I preached to the people principally upon the tithing the Poor Fund the establishing of schools and building their wallOn the Sunday I was at Bingham's Fort. I preached in the morning and dined with Bishop Bingham. I found this to be a flourishing place and well calculated for a city. The farming land was good and abundant. The population at the time was one hundred families. Much wheat was raised but I did not learn the amount. The Bishop only had 30 bushels of tithing wheat and 15 tons of hay: the remainder was in the hands of the people. They had two schools ready to commence their fort walls were 110 rods long ^and the fort 64 rods wide^. Three quarters of it was in the process of erection. A part of "Little Soldier's" band of Indians were distributed among the people to support and learn to work They did not like it and seemed very mad and some were leaving their wickeups and going to Weber river. Bingham fort is three miles from Ogdon.I left this fort and rode to Ogdon Hole and preached in the eveing to a full house. Thomas Dunn was Bishop Ogdon Hole was one of the most flourishing settlements North of Salt Lake City. Their soil was very rich and the water abundant. There were 47 families and a school of fifty scholars. Their Fort was laid out 140 rods long and 74 wide to be surrounded with a wall which was to be built of stone 4 feet thick and ten feet high and laid in mortar. Much of the stone was on the ground but not yet laid up. They had raised there sixteen thousand bushels of wheat. The Bishop had in hand six hundred bushels of tithing wheat and two tons of hay They had also 13 head of tithing cattle. The wall of the city was commencedOn the 4th I was at Willow Creek. There 
 She manifested great confidence in the cause she had embracedand also exhorted us to confidence in God and to keep his commandments.To appearence she was dying but as on the day before she again revivedI prayed with her and laid hands upon her and commended untoour Father in Heaven. She slept some during the night.Two days after Phebe was still very feeble and lowand I returned to Eaton to get some necessaries for her. I also felt thepower of the Destroyer resting upon in the forepart of the dayIn the evening Phebe for the first time duringher sickness began to lay hold on faith for her recovery. Herconfidence grew strong and we laid hold on faith together; andtogether we confessed our sins before the Lord and covenanted tokeep his commandments.I had with me some oil that was consecratedin Kirtland for my anointing. I again consecrated it forthe healing of the sick and bowed myself before the Lordand prayed with my companion and anointed and laidhands upon her in the name of Jesus Christ. Thanks beto God our prayer was answered and the fever left herTwo days more and the voice of the Lordwas to us to arise and continue our way to Zion andthrough the mercy of God Phebe was enabled to rise andwalk a little. She had been confined at this place fourdays where we were treated kindly.Five days farther on our journey andwhere we put up at night we suddenly heard the sad newsof the death of my brother Asahel H. Woodruff who died atTerre Haute Indiania on the 18th of October 1838 at 3 o'clockin the morning.In the paper was published an account ofthe Administrator's sale of the property of my brother. It wassold on the 4th of December for about three thousand dollarsMr Robert A Smith was his administratorThere was also in the same paper anaccount of the horrid butchery of 18 Latter-day Saints in DavisCounty Missouri by a wicked mobThe next day I rode to Terrehaute Indianiathrough the delightful scenery of that country and drove to whatwas Ashahel H. Woodruff's book store. Instead of finding him there 
 God; and if this people will not build up Zion they will beremoved out of their placeEvery time we build a house or a citywe should better it. Everything around us should beneat and clean.Now look at this building for a school-houseThe ground around this building should be prepared for a play ground and should be kept neat and clean andbe prepared so as to make the children happy. Childrenshould be in a clean place. But how is it here. Themoment the children step out of door they see nothingbut filth all the day long. The minds of our childrenwhile young are pure and they should not spend their timein filthy places for it affects their minds and feelingsThey should be in a clean place for they are visitedby the angels of God; but parents do not realize this althoughit is trueYou may say I do not have time to keepmy dwellings school-houses door yards &c clean. No nor you never will have till you die upon the same principle but youshould take time. Now it should not take a week tillI would clean out my door yard; but the people in this cityhave not had time to clean out their door yards or to makeanything else that they ought to doI will show you that I will set anexample for my children to followI will teach those things which we oughtto do to day. I have preached this doctrine from thebeginning. The first time I ever preached was to tellthe people their duties of to-dayNow if you had all the gold in theworld what would you do with it? Would you go to 
 were 35 families at this place and Charles Hubbard was its Bishop. Their Fort was laid out half a mile long 70 rods wide with a wall to be built around it, 70 rods of which was then 6 feet high They had raised 12,000 bushels of wheat. They were very deficient in Schools and had not but 3 months good schooling for three years. The Bishop was very anxious to obtain a good teacherNext day I went to Box Elder and preached in the evening at the School House. This place contained 60 families and brother Davis was their Bishop. The majority of the people were mostly Welsh and Danish and mostly poor. There was but little wheat raised by them this year. The Bishop had on hand 20 tons of tithing hay and 15 bushels of wheat. They had no school that Winter. Their fort wall was laid out 200 rods long enclosing a fort 100 rods wide The wall was to be built of stone 3 1/2 feet thick at the bottom and 2 feet at the top and 8 feet high. It was in the progress of erectionI returned revisited the settlements on my way home and reached Great Salt Lake City December the 9th.Next day was Sunday. Charles C Rich addressed the assembly in the Tabernac[l]e and gave an account of the rise and progress of the settlement of San Barnadino.The Legislature of Utah.The Legislature of the Territory of Utah met on the morning of December the 11th. The following were the members of the Council.   Heber C. Kimball Orson Pratt    Daniel H Wells Wilford Woodruff 
 he was in his grave and his store occupied by his Administratorand clerk.I had an interview with his clerk and madeenquiries concerning my brother's sickness and death but deferedattending to his business until the following day. It waswith difficulty that we could get entertainment in the cityfor the night but finally we obtained an empty house.The next day December 13th I spent mostlyin enquiring into and attending to the affairs of my brotherAsahel. I learnt from Messrs Smith and Ray that hedied at 3 o'clock on the morning of the 18th of October andthat he was sick ten days and deprived of his reasonfour days before his death. While in this state hismind in its wanderings was principally upon his businessbut he occasionally spoke of his friends. His disease wasthe congestive fever on the brain.They farther said that his mind forseveral months previous to his death had seemed to themoccupied by some matters unknown to them. They was notso well acquainted with the secret of this as I was forI was corresponding with him and knew by his lettersthat his mind was deeply interested upon the subject of theGospel and the Church of Latter-day SaintsOf his character they testified that hewas moral in his life temperate in his practises belovedand honoured as a citizen and his loss deeply feltAsahel was indeed a young man of veryexcellent talents, firm and indipendent in mind and alsoindipendent and liberal in his principalsI had not been privileged with an interviewwith him for about seven years but we had correspondedwith each other by letter. He had a peculiar art inletter-writing which gave much interest to all the productionsof his pen. Both of us had long anticipated much uponour meeting but my hopes were thus suddenly blighted butI said the will of the Lord be done: All is right!His entire stock of books with his personalproperty was sold but his private letters journals manuscriptsaccount books pocket watch penknife pencil letter stamp bosom pin 
 California? No but go to and build up Zion. You may say thereis no California here; we have no gold. But it is not gold that isgoing to build up Zion though we shall use a good deal of it, butwe have to do it with our hands.You can make a beginning and do somethingYou can set an example. You can clean out your house and yardand make that clean and you can stop the bed bugs from runningaround you.I do not see the first fruit or shade tree in thiscity. Come up to the Salt Lake City and get some fruit-trees and set out and have some fruit growingNow this is Zion and the light has comeand is shining upon you and you are called upon to buildup Zion. How? By going to California? No; forthere are millions of gold here and the Lord will send it intosight when he thinks it is best for us to have it as he did inCalifornia.If you think it is not best to come here goback to Missouri. Old Father Harris said that he wouldstay at Kanesville so that when the Church got readyto go back to Jackson County he would have but a short wayto go to what the people here would. Brother George ASmith told him he might happen to find it much thenearest way there by way of the Rocky Mountains and many will find that to be the case. The longest wayround will be the shortest way thereWe have been called get speculatorsand misers. I have told the people I was the greatestmiser and speculator in the world; for I am layingplans to try to obtain everything there is on earth andin heaven that is good. That is what I am afterall the time. I have told the people I would possess

 heaven while they would become servants to the next world. Myspeculations are not confined to this world aloneNow I say go to and make a finehouse in this place. yYou may say I have not the capitalvery well. Look at Salt Lake City. We have built up that city without capital. That was built up withthe strength of our hands which is our capitalNow I want to ask the people herewhat do you say to going out on to your lots to build yourhouses and set out fruit trees? Your wall around this fortis not much protection. You might as well stick upa row of willows to scare and stop the Indians as anythingthere is here.Now go to and build up some good houses in this place.

 After organizing we waited upon the Governor by a committee and he met with the two houses in joint sessoion and delivered his message.On Sunday the 17th J. M. Grant bore testimony to the marvellous healing of the sick multitude at Montrose by Joseph which I recorded at the time and which will be found in my history of that date. Heber C. Kimball joined in the same testimony.After the close of the afternoon meeting I met with the Presidency and Twelve in President Young's Office in the upper room which was dedicated for prayer that day by us, the sick prayed for and oil consecratedIn the evening I preached to a full house upon the subject of education in the Seventeenth WardAfter spending the 19th in the Legislature I delivered ^a lecture^ at night to some 60 young men who had assembled at the Sixteenth Ward for the purpose of forming a Philosophical Society I spoke upon the subject of education. They appointed a Committee of five to draw up a Constitution and to appoint a President.An Affray Between The Soldiers and Citizenson Christmas DayThere was a great excitement through our city during the forepart of the day. Some of the soldiers who were quartered in the heart of the city became intoxicated and began to fight among themselves and soon some of the citizens became mixed with them. The soldiers fired upon the people and the people fired stones upon them in return. Some were wounded on both sides but none killed. The military officers drove the 
 heart upon houses lands gold or anything else on earth so as to begin toturn my heart away from the Lord the day before that comesI want the Lord to take me awayMay God bless you: Amen.Remarks by President KimballPresident Kimball followed and said:I felt quite well in the forenoon butI do not feel well this afternoonI know what President Young has said is trueWe have come here and we have dedicated this people and thisplace to God.Now do the people realize why we are here. Nothey do not. We are here for the benefit of all Israel. Wehave not come here for a salary. We have come here to dothe will of God and I will say that the yoke is off from ournecks, and it never shall be put on again, not on the necksof this people; for if we do not do as the Lord wants us to dohe will raise up a people who will do it. I tell you thatGod will smite any people who undertake to stop this workand I say that what President Young has said is trueYou know that our children have tolearn the Alphabet first. So it is with this people. Thethings which God teaches us are small and simple inmany respects but they are just as necessary for us tolearn and practise as it is for the child to learn hisletters in order to understand the arts and sciences forwe have to learn and practise small things before we canobtain and carry out the greater things of GodNow we are required to begin to buildup and adorn Zion. We should set out fruit trees 
 soldiers into the barracks and the Mayor and marshal of the city cleared the streets of the citizens which ended the frayOn this Christmas day also I met with the inhabitants of the Fourtheenth Ward and delivered an Address to the people Isaac Morley Bishop Hoagland and others addressed them as well and then they were dismissed for two hours when they came together again and spent the afternoon and evening in festivities and the dance.A Ball Given By Col. Steptoe and Judge KinneyDecember the 26thThe Presidency and Twelve and many others were invited by these military and civil representatives of the United States. It was a splendid party and held at the City Hotel kept by Wilkie. We had a good supper and a pleasant danceOn the evening of the 29th I attended the Polisophical Assembly at the house of Lorenzo Snow and spent the evening in a very agreeable manner. The time was spent in the performance of music delivery of speeches reading of poems & singing of songs. The room was beautifully decorated with flags and emblems of the different arts and sciences. Variety was in the scene.On the last day of the year I looked over my Journal and found the following to be a synopsis of my doings of the past yearSynopsis Of 1854Travels: I travelled eighteen hundred and eighty nine milesMeetings: I attended 47 meetingsDiscourses: I preached 44 discourses
