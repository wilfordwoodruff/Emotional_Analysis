 Nauvoo, Ill. September 15, 1845.    Bro. W. Woodruff: Ido not often trouble my  friends with letters, on account of a  multiplicity of business, which deters me  from writing. We are now in thee  midst of another great mob. From  fifty to sixty houses have been burnt  in thes Green plains and Lima branches  of the church, and of course two or  three hundred people thrown houseless  into the naked air to perish. The  French drove the Arabs into the  cave and smoked them to death, but  the Americans drive the saints out  of their houses, burn them, and  leave the inmates to famish: which  exhibits the most shocking barbtyarity,  in this christian age?    Last night bro Fellows, 4 miles this side  of Carthage, had his house, barn, and grain  burnt.    Writz are out for the "Twelve" and others  upon the grave charge of Treason.    We are at peace in Nauvoo. The  Temple is finishing rapidly. The steeple  is outwardly finished and looks grand. 
 The Nauvoo house has arisen within three  weeks nearly two stories.    We have had a good season for grain  but, I some fear, unless the Sheriff and  proper authorities raise force enough  to disperse the mob, that much will  be burnt. However, I have no reflections  to make, while the devil has hiz day.  The saints, if they live godly in Christ  Jesuz shall suffer, as they always  have, persecution.    You know we wait patiently for the  "when"—Thus saith the Lord, and  "then," blessed be the name of the  Lord, we shall be "free indeed:"  having come up through great trib-  ulation.    We have not had so sickly a season  as last year, though many have  chills and fever lightly.    I was at Bro. Benbow's the other  day: he was down with the new ague & fever  but not bad. Your little ^willy^ was hearty  as apig buck.    Under the management of the "Twelve"  every thing has flaurished so visibly,  that no one can doubt but the Lord  reigns with saints in Nauvoo.    We have had a paradise summer. 
 I often think "O for a lodge in some  vast wilderness:    "some boundless contiguity of shade" &c  where percutions would cease, but in a   moment I reflect no cross no crown,  and go ahead    Light as a cloud in yonder sky,  to gain the bliss of those on high,  In the bounds of him  and Everlasting cov  yours  W.W. Phelps    give my respects to  all especially  Bro Hedlock    P.S. I wish br Woodruff would procure  (the battle ax of the Lord as William [Sontte] [page torn]  a pair of silver spectacles that will mag [page torn]  tolerable well pebble eyes if possible. In a  shop in London by inquiring for a  pair between the age of 55 and 60  the right kind might be had and sent  in a good case by the emigrating Saints  I need such a pair.

 Nauvoo, Ill. June 1845    Dear Brother in the Lord:    Ever engaged in thinking or writing, I   have very little time to bestow upon friends,  but, with a holy desire for the Twelve, as  God's special ambassadors, for this generation,  I take a moment. I sent you "come to me,"  last winter, and shall send the "capstone"  by br. Fielding.    As I am a descendant of the "Royal  family," my forefather's name being 'Guelph'  till Cromwell expelled one to America, and  for propriety he changed it to "Phelps'. I have  a great anxiety for the salvation of Queen  Victoria and her posterity, as heirs of a   better and more lasting kingdom—wherein  the blood of Joseph will be exalted as  Kings and priests to God, and shall reign  with Christ upon the earth a thousand  years.    Every thing moves forward in the United   States as if Jehovah's wisest servants  were determined to usher in a day,  (with the co-operation of Jesus and his angels,)  of righteousness and peace; a day when  the children of Israel will be gathered home, 
 to fulfil the ordinances written, and "multiply  and replenish the earth and subdue it," ac-  cording to the first commandment to Adam,  which, as yet remains, in statu quo.    The Times and Seasons and neighbor contain a  living stream of my mind and so you can  satisfy yourself at leisure.    The Temple ascends "on high" rapidly: the  attic story looks grand, and we all  pray that it may speedily be finished, and  the endowment follow.    The Rigdonites have labored day and night,  during the late triall of ^the^ assassins for the  murder of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, to  scare up a mob, but On[e] who said  to the raging sea, "Peace be still," has  sent forth a few hot snaps of fire about  this country, and now and then a cold drop  of hail—and left them and others to [think]  on oh in their wickedness.    We all say—God bless you Elder  Woodruff and family; and Br. Hedlock  and all: Amen.    As ever    W.W.Phelps.    Elder W. Woodruff   36 Chapel St.  Liverpool  England

 INTELLIGENCE COMES FROM GOD, ETC. 227    INTELLIGENCE COMES FROM GOD--SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD  --GREAT CHANGES TO TAKE PLACE ON THE EARTH--ISRAEL OF  THE LAST DAYS--WHY THE JEWS CANNOT BE CONVERTED.    A discourse by Elder Wilford Woodruff, Delivered in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake  City, February 22, 1857.    I feel it a privilege to bear testi-  mony before the Saints to the exhor-  tations we have heard this morning  from brothers Richards and Wells.   We have had good teachings, good   counsel, and good doctrine taught us.   And I presume I feel in a measure   like the rest of my brethren when I   rise to speak to this people in the  Tabernacle, where such large congre-  gations of Saints assemble; I have a   desire that what I say may do the  people good, may edify them. My bre-  thren also have the same desire.    We realize that the minds of this   people need feeding continually, and  we all have to depend upon the Holy   Spirit and the Lord to feed our minds  from that inexhaustible fountain of   intelligence which comes from God,  for we cannot obtain food from any   other source to feed the immortal  mind of man. Here are a large as-  sembly of minds who are reaching  forth to receive light and truth before   the Lord.    I realize that we have a great many  lessons to learn in the school we are  in, and myself as a teacher in con-  nexion with my brethren have also  a great deal to learn. I feel that I   am yet in my alphabet, and feel some-  times that I am incapable of teaching   this people, when I realize they are in  the road which leads to celestial glory --  to eternal life and eternal exalta-  tion. I know I am dependent as I  know my brethren are upon God,  upon the Holy Ghost for all the light,  truth, and intelligence which we have  to impart unto you.    The words which brother Wells quo-  ted, and which brother Samuel Rich-  ards referred to, furnish as strong a  proof as can be furnished as to the  true principle of prosperity, touching  things temporal and things spiritual.   I refer to the words of Jesus Christ   which he spoke to his followers:   "Seek first the kingdom of God and  his righteousness, and all other things  shall be added unto you." I will tell  you, brethren and sisters, we may try  it all the days of our lives, we may   try every path and every principle in   this world, and we as Saints cannot  prosper upon any other mode of pro-  ceeding than by first seeking the   kingdom of heaven and its righteous-  ness; when we do this there is no   blessing, there is no good, no exalta-  tion, gift, grace, desire, or anything  that a good man can wish that is pro-  fitable, and good for time and for eter-  nity, but will be given unto us.    A great many people have tried to   seek for happiness independent of first  seeking the kingdom of heaven, &c.,   but they have always found it an up-  hill business, and so shall we if we   try it.    We as a people should have learned  by this time, after having the experi-  ence we have gained, to make up our  minds to take hold and build up the  kingdom of God, and it should be 
 Trust in the Lord.    228     JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    the first thing before us, for if we  build up the kingdom of God we build  up ourselves, and if we do not we never  shall be built up.  This is the truth.   There seems to be something connect-  ed with the kingdom of God and that   is righteousness; we are exhorted to   seek the righteousness that belongs to  it as well as the kingdom itself.    The kingdom of God is a righteous  kingdom, all its laws are righteous,  its government is a righteous govern-  ment, and the king who governs and  controls it does so upon righteous and  eternal principles, and we must act  upon the same principles of righteous-  ness. Who cannot see that if a man  seeks first the kingdom of heaven and   its righteousness that he will become   righteous and hence he will be blessed  and justified in all of his acts.    With regard to the feelings of the  people that brothers Wells and Rich-  ards have referred to, touching the   consecration of their property and de-  dicating themselves to God, I will say,  if we build up the kingdom of God  we should be in that kingdom, and all   we have should be in it, and we should  have faith enough in the Lord to   know it is in a safe place.    I am a good deal of the opinion of   old Captain Russell, who was an ex-  tensive ship-builder, and paid thou-  sands of dollars yearly to the Gentiles   as insurance fees. After he embraced  "Mormonism," he began to reflect,   "here am I paying thousands of dol-  lars yearly to the Gentiles to insure   my ships, and I have to trust to the  God of heaven after all to save my   ships from sinking, and to prosper me  in all my undertakings; this is not   right." So he went to Liverpool,   where the insurance office was, to   settle his insurance bills and close up  his business with the firm.    The gentlemen of the firm asked  him when he had got through, saying,   "Have we not treated you well, Mr.   Russell?" "Yes, I have no fault to   find with you." "What, then, is your  object in pursuing this course? We   have done business with you a good  many years; we want to know if you  are going to change your insurance   office?"  "I am."  "Will you tell   us where you are going to have your  business done in the future?"  "Yes,   I am going to have it done in heaven,  for the insurance offices do not control  the winds, the elements are not obe-  dient to them, and I have been paying  ten thousand dollars a-year for insuring  a few ships, and I have to trust in the   Lord anyhow, so in the future I shall   pay my insurance fee into the Lord's   treasury."    The gentlemen of the office thought  he was cracked or beside himself, for  I tell you trusting in the Lord in  these days is an unpopular business  with the world.  But the Saints have   to trust in the Lord, and we might as  well begin and seek this kingdom and   the interest of it, and the righteous-  ness of it, and build it up first as last.    I believe the people are reforming in  this thing; I believe they are increa-  sing in their faith, and have manifes-  ted it here in the city this winter, and  I am glad to see it.    The exhortation we have had this  morning is proper and seasonable, as  we have been sowing the seed of the   word this winter among the people,   and we should watch and see that the  seed is sown in good g[r]ound, and try  to cultivate the principles we hear   that the fruits of righteousness may  appear in abundance.  In doing this  we will be saved.    We have had one of the most in-  teresting seasons this winter that we   have ever enjoyed since the Church   and kingdom of God has been organ-  ized in the last days.  We have had  new lessons opened unto us by the  servants of the Lord, and among those  things the mercy of the Lord has   been manifested in a great degree to-  wards this people.  I have reflected 
 INTELLIGENCE COMES FROM GOD, ETC.     229    on His mercy and I feel we should be  faithful and humble, and prove true  unto the Lord our God because of  this mercy which has been manifested   unto us, and we should be very care-  ful hereafter, as President Young ex-  horted us the last time he spoke con-  cerning this people continuing to com-  mit sin.  He plainly laid before us  the consequences of this course; we   should let the past suffice wherein we  have done anything in which we can-  not be justified.  I am satisfied that   the people in these valleys will never  hear the same proclamation which we  have heard this winter.    If this people with the light they   have, the teachings they have, and  the examples they have had set before  them intermingled with chastisement--  if they still will go on and be neglect-  ful of their duties, with regard to their   salvation they will have to pay the   debt, for the sinner in Zion will be   cut off from the Church of God, and  will have to pay the penalty whether   it be small or great.  It is of the ut-  most importance that we should guard  ourselves against sin as the tree of   life is guarded.  We have no time to   throw away in the service of sin, in   committing iniquity and grieving the  Holy Spirit of God.    I tell you when you look around   and see the state of the world on the  one hand, and what we have to per-  form on the other, and what the king-  dom of God has got to arrive at in  order to fulfil its destiny and the re-  velations of Jesus Christ, our chief   object should be to build up the king-  dom of God and roll it on.    As I remarked last evening in the   High Priests' Quorum, we have been  rolling this kingdom up-hill, up a  mountain; we have been toiling  against a mighty current all the day  long from its first organization, but  the day will soon come, if this people  will do their duty and take hold of   the kingdom of God as they should  do, it will soon get on the top of the   mountain, and then it will begin to  roll down from the mountains, and it  will gather both strength and speed   as it goes, and then instead of sing-  ing, "Get out of the way, the hand-  carts rolling," it will be "Get out of   the way the kingdom's coming," and  it will not stop until it has filled the  whole earth.  The Lord has pro-  claimed this in all the revelations He  has given on the subject.    This kingdom has got to stand,  spread itself abroad, and gather   unto itself strength.  The Lord is   going to work with this kingdom, and   with this people.  The Lord says in  the parable of the vineyard, "My ser-  vants laboured with their mights, and  the Lord laboured with them, and they   prevailed, and brought forth the fruits  of the kingdom, and the bitter branches  were broken off, and the tame olive   brought forth good fruit, and the vine-  yard was no more corrupt."  This   should be uppermost in our minds,  we should look for the building up of  the kingdom, and secure not only   blessings for ourselves, but seek to  become saviours of men on Mount  Zion, and try to do all the good we  can, labouring to promote the cause  and interest of Zion in every depart-  ment thereof where we are all called   to act.    By pursuing this course we shall  be prospered, and have continual peace  in our minds, and as the Lord has   said, nothing will be withheld from  any man that seeks for the righteous-  ness and blessings of the kingdom of  God.  Salvation should be the upper-  most thing with us, and you will find  if ever we seek to do something else  besides carrying out the dictates of the   Holy Spirit, we will get into the fog   and into darkness and trouble, and  we shall be ignorant of the way we  are pursuing.  Every day that we   live we need the power of the Lord--  the power of His Holy Spirit and the 
 REMARKS    By Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF, Bowery,  Sunday Afternoon, Aug. 26, 1860.    REPORTED BY JOHN V. LONG,    Brethren and sister, we are blest above all  other people upon the face of the earth, not  only temporally but spiritually. I consider  any people blest of the Lord to whom he has  revealed the gospel of Jesus Christ, to whom  he has given the holy priesthood and authori-  ty to administer in the ordinances of his house.  That people are greatly blest, far above their  fellow men who do not enjoy this privilege.  I consider this to be our position to-day; we  have the privilege of walking in the light, we  have the privilege of comprehending and  knowing the truth, of knowing the way to be  saved and exalted in the presence of our Fa-  ther and God. We are in a position to know  his mind and will, through his servants the  the prophets. The Lord has given unto us  teachers and inspired men, men who are in-  spired by the spirit and power of God; clothed  them with truth and endowed them with wis-  dom to teach us at all times the path we  should walk in. This is a great blessing  whether we realize it or not.    The Lord looks down upon our work and  considers our ignorance, and so do those holy  beings who surround his throne, but yet  we know enough to do our duty, magnify  our calling and fulfill the object of our crea-  tion. And any man or community who  have the gospel of Christ, the holy priest-  hood and the power of the Holy Ghot that  we have, possess a great advantage over  the world, for they do not comprehend,  they do not see nor understand the things  that await them. They do not understand the  dealings of God with them in any respect.  It is not so with the Latter Day Saints, for as  long as they continue to receive the truth their   minds are opened to understand the character  of the day and age in which we live, and all  those trying scenes that are approaching us;  the veil is taken from off the face of the earth,  and we see things, to some extent, as they   are.    We have received the gift of the Holy Ghost  by the laying on of hands, and the veil of   darkness, of doubt and fear is taken from our   minds, and we can see clearly where to go an  what to do, and we feel that our spirit is right,  that we are acceptable before the Lord our  God, and are the subjects of his blessings.    When sitting here and listening to the words  of the servants of God I reflect day by day on  the things of God that are revealed to us, and  I am inevitably led to the conclusion that  there is no people upon the face of the earth  enjoying such great blessings as the Almight  has bestowed upon us. The heavens are full  of blessings, and the Lord is willing to bestow  them upon us. The hearts of the servants of  God are full of blessings, comfort and edifying  words for the saints. Then it is certainly  our duty to make a right use of the knowledge  we have received and to acknowledge the  hand of the Lord in all things. We should try  to gain wisdom, knowledge and understand-  ing, and from the experience we are hav-  ing while in this great school. This would  stimulate us to action, and inasmuch as we do  this, and walk in the light of truth we shall  be satisfied, and continue to do as we have  been taught. By pursuing this course in our  connection with the work of God we are en-  abled to drink of that well of water that  springs up into everlasting life.    I do not believe that any man in the world  who has power, wealth, influence and a good  understanding of things is satisfied with the  present confused state of the world, either  religiously or politically, neither do I believe  that a man who does not know God nor the  principles of eternal life and salvation; a man,  for instance, that has come to an understand-  ing of the world, and that has received the  benefits of civilization, as understood by the  great mass of christendom; I do not, I say,  believe that such a man is or can be satisfied.  I can readily believe that the professors of re-  ligion are not fully satisfied in their minds and  feelings, unless they have partaken of that  life which is made manifest by the gift and  influence of the Holy Ghost. And we have  an abundance of evidence to prove that the  world are not satisfied with their condition,  not even those that are seeking the pleasures  of life, we frequently hear them complaining  of the state of affairs at the present time.    Man possesses a spirit that must endure  forever, a spirit that comes from God, and in-  asmuch as he is not fed from that same source   or power that created him he is not and can-  not be satisfied. I can say from my own ex-  perience, that although I sought for the truth  diligently I was never satisfied until I heard  the fulness of the gospel proclaimed by the  Lord's chosen servants. I had no inspired  man to say "this is the way, walk ye in it."  It is true that I could read the Bible, I could  pray and to some extent know what was right  and proper for me to do, at least so far as  moral religion was concerned. I enjoyed a  portion of that spirit which in those day  would lead a man to do good to his fellow  man, but of course I had not the knowledge of   God. But in these days when the holy priest-  hood is restored to us we have no excuse for  saying that our minds are not satisfied, for  the blessings are given to us, they are within  our reach, and it is your privilege and mine to  enjoy them.    I feel to rejoice greatly in the blessings of  the gaspel that are given to us, and that we  can behold so visibly the hand of God in his  dealings with this people. He has fought  our battles and given us victory.    We are all sensible of our imperfections,    [column break]    but notwithstanding these things the Lord has  been true to his word; he is fulfilling his word,  and has been doing this from the beginning.  When I look at these things my heart rejoices,  and I feel to give thanks to the Lord and to aid  all I can in the building up of his kingdom.  We can enjoy the true comforts of the Holy  Ghost, we should honor our calling and be  true to the convenants we have made. if we  attend to our duties and walk humbly before  the Lord, we shall be satisfied with life, and  with the manifestations of the goodness of  God unto us.    Let me advise you, brethren and sisters, to  improve everything that is good, perform  every duty devolving upon us, and we  shall have much joy and consolation at the  close of this probation in knowing that we  have done the best we could, that we have  acted up to the best light we had. It certain-  ly must be a satisfaction to us to know that  we are building up the kingdom of God, to  know that we are seeking to overcome the   powers of darkness, and all evil that prevails  upon the face of the earth, in our day and gen-  eration. This gospel has been offered to the  present generation, it has been offered to the  christian world, and almost all the nations  have heard it in some way or other, and they  now have the privilege of receiving or reject-  ing it.    This poeple have received the word with  joy and gladness, and many of them have  brought forth fruit to the honor and glory of  GOd, and have been valiant in the cause of  Jesus Christ; they are friends of God, friends  to themselves and to their fellow men. But  when men reject the gospel, the gifts, the   promises and blessings that are presented and  offered unto them they come short of their  duty and are under condemnation.    The Lord has said by the revelator John,  in speaking of this work, that at the hour  of his judgement he would send an angel, who  should fly through the midst of heaven with  the everlasting gospel to preach to every na-  tion, kindred, tongue and people, crying with  a loud voice, saying fear God, and give glory  to him, for the hour of his judgment is come.  The Almight has in this way warned this  generation, and told them what the result  of reject the gospel of Christ would be.  Still many in the world have sought to destroy  this work from the earth, as well as those who  have been its advocates.    Scores and hundres of the elders of Israel  have been faithful and true to their integrity,  and for this they will have their reward, while  the wicked will perish. I do feel thankful  that so many of us have cleaned our garments  of the blood of this generation; and I rejoice  that we are located here in these valleys of  the mountains. I do not know that I could be  in any better place than this. We are shut  up in these chamers of the mountains in  fulfillment of the words of the lord, and he  has led us all the time, he has marked out  our course and directed our footsteps. Br.  Joseph Smith, br. Brigham Young and all our  leaders have been inspired from the beginning  to give counsel and to do those things that  have been required of them, and they were  led here by the inspiration of the Almight,  as much so as moses, or any others who have  held the priesthood. President Young prophe-  cied the deliverance of this people, and his  words were backed up by the testimony of the   Holy Ghost, when, to all human appearance  there was no arm could save us, and we were  delivered by the power of God. If we live our  religion we shall see more manifestations of  the goodness and power of God.    It is our privilege to follow the dictates of  the spirit of the Lord, and to have it for our  guide and companion, and by doing this the  blessings of the heavens will be upon us as  fast as we are prepared to receive them    I know that the devil seeks to overthrow  this people, and it seems that the powers of  darkness have, to a great extent, prevailed in  their attempts to control the hearts of the  children of men. For many generations the  powers of darkness have had almost universal   sway, but I thank God that I have lived  to see the day when the kingdom of God has  been set up upon the earth, and that it is no  more to be thrown down forever. Men with  wicked hearts may seek to pull down the  cause of truth, but all their efforts will be in  vain, for the blessing of the Almighty is upon  his saints, the inspiration of the heavens is  upon his servants, and they will overcome the  powers of temptation and of the adversary.  It is verily true that we have a warfare to  engage in, for Satan seeks to engage in one  with us, with our children, and with all the  rising generation,—the hope of Israel, and of  the prophets and apostles of this kingdom.    I feel that the time has come when we shall  prevail, and I rejoice in it. I feel that the  Lord is going to bless this people abundantly.  The minds of the saints are expanding and  they are coming to understanding. This cer-  tainly should be the case as we advance, for  the Lord will make a short work in the last  days, and there is but little time, if I may be  allowed the saying, to have the words of the   prophets fulfilled.    There is a good spirit here. The righteousness  and truth, and the power of God are now  prevailing over the wickedness of the profane  and the iniquity of the depraved, and the  power of the devil is fast giving way and los-  ing its hold on this people. The power of  God is in the ascedant, and the faith of the  saints holds the powers of darkness at bay,  so that they cannot carry out their evil de-  signs in the midst of Zion. This is a conso-  lation to me, and my heart rejoices in these  things, and I can say truly that I feel happy  and comfortable, and I pray that the Lord will  sustain and uphold those that are set to lead    [column break]    The Lord is their guide, and there is not  a man nor a woman in Israel but who knows  that they are govered and controlled by the  power of God, if they are living up to their  privileges.    Israel was not always led with the same  degree of clearness and understanding that we  enjoy in our day. This is a great blessing to  us, and we ought to be faithful, and full of  thankfulness. I feel happy in saying that I  know our leaders are upheld by the prayers of  the brethren and sisters, not only in this Ter-  ritory but throughout the world. This is right,  and just as it should be, for it is our duty in our  secret places, in our family prayers, to remem-  ber the Lord's annointed and chosen servants;  and we should not only pray for them, but for  each other; be full of faith, prayer and confi-  dence; and manifest our faith by carrying out  the counsel that is given by the leaders of this  people. Yes, brethren and sisters, it is a  good day and generation in which we live; it  is a good time to worship God and live faith-  ful to our religion, and this is a most splended  place in these valleys of the mountains for us to  live and improve. We are blest with good land,  with water and timber, and here we have the  privilege of saving our children, and this is a  great blessing unto us. If we set a good example  before our children, and try to instruct them  from their childhood to maturity; teach them  to pray and to honor the Almight; teach  them those principles that will sustain them  in the midst of all trials, that the spirit of the  Lord may rest upon them, and then they will  not easily be led astry. Good impressions   will follow them through life, and whatever  principles may be presented those good im-  pressions will never leave them.    I have long been satisfied that the devil was  making great exertions to drive a wedge in  between parents and children, trying to in-  spire and instil into the minds of the sons  and daughters of the saints those corrupting  notions that will prevent them from following  the footsteps of their fathers and mothers,  but this cannot be done! The sons and daugh-  ters of this people, if we do our duty, will be  held by the strength and in the name of Isra-  el's God.    I have looked upon this matter a great deal,  and I have concluded that there never was a  generation of people upon whose shoulders  rested greater responsiblities than rest upon  this people, and than must rest upon their sons  and daughters. If this be true, how import-  ant it is that we would be wise father and  mothers, and that we should act wisely in in-  stilling into their youthful minds all those  principles that will lead them to that which  is just, and to carry out in their lives the prin-  ciples of righteousness and truth. Many of  our children have not had experience in the  world; they know nothing of the scenes and  corruptions that are among the wocked; they  do not realize their present positions, nor the  blessings conferred upon them by their parents  having obedyed the fulness of the gospel.    We who have gained experience see the  darkness and abominations that are in the  hearts of men, but our children, not being able  to contrast the evil with the good, cannot see  and realize the blessings they enjoy in being  under the influence of teachers in Israel; I do  not refer to their parents alone, but those who  lead and govern in the midst of Israel.    I have felt for a long time and I think I have  realized to some extent, that the duties rest-  ing upon us are very great, and that we ought  to strive to improve in wisdom and knowledge  and in the principles of government in order  that we may know how to be fathers, mothers  and saviors, and learn how to be councilors,  and how to preside, not only in our own family  circles, but wherever we may be called to  act. It is a great thing to know how to act  so as gain the feelings and affections of our   families, that will lead them in the path  wherein they may be saved. This is a study  and a work that should not be laid aside by  parents, nor by the Elders in Israel.    Many times we may consider business so  urgent that it must crowd these things out of  our minds, but this should not be. Any man's  mind that is open, and who looks forward to  the work that lies before us, will see and feel  that the responsibility that rests upon him  concerning his own family, and especially in  the rearing up of his children, is very great.    We want to save our children, and to have   them partake of all the blessings that en-  circles the santified, to have them receive the  blessings of their parents who have been faith-  ful to the fulness of the gospel. We do not  want them to go through all the routine of  false doctrines and erroneous systems that we  have had to wade through in our generation.    This is the way we feel in regard to our  present position, and i feel that God will  bless us inasmuch as we strive to improve and  listen to council. It is our duty to pray before  the Lord, and to teach those principles when-  ever we have an opportunity. And I feel to  thank the Lord, and to teach those principles when-  ever we have an opportunity. And I feel to  thank the Lord, and to rejoice in seeing as  many as there are who are willing to listen to  the counsel of their parents; for I realize that  when they are called upon to act in their  priesthood and ministry, they would be ready  and willing to listen to the counsel of their  brethren, and thus they will be the means of  saving the rising generation.    I pray that the Lord, may bless us and give  us largely of his spirit, that our minds may  be clear to see and comprehend this great  work. This kingdom is but yet a very small  stone, comparatively speaking; it is not yet   a great mountain, neither has it filled the  whole earth, but as the Lord lives, it will.  This is how I feel, and I sincerely desire that  we may have our minds opened upon the sub-  ject of the building up of the kingdom of God.  In this we shall have joy, no matter whether    [column break]    in prosperity or adversity; so long as we do  our duty the Lord will protect us, and the  powers of evil will have no dominion over us,  but our hearts will be buoyant and we shall  rise step by step in wisdom, knowledge and  power until we shall be able to build up the  temples of our God, behold the law of the  Lord, go forth from Zion, and the word of the  Lord from Jerusalem. This law he intends  that we should receive to prepare us for the  coming of the great bridegroom. In both our  temporal and spiritual labor we should seek to  know the mind and will of God concering us;  we should have the Spirit of the Lord with us  continually, and our mediations should be  righteous and holy before the Lord.    We cannot go to reap our crops and wor-  ship the devil one day, and then the next  go into the Tabernacle or temple of the Lord  and worhsip him. That is not our religion, it  does not admit of this; we cannot feel justi-  fied in such conduct, but if we live our religion  the blessings of Almight God will be with  us, and he will multiply them upon our heads.    I hope and pray that each and all of us may  do this, that we may seek to sustain each  other, and those whom the Lord has placed  over us, which may God grat for Christ's  sake. Amen.

And if we will so live before the Lord,  the Spirit will reveal to us every day   what our duties are; I do not care  what it is we are engaged in, we   should first find out the will of the  Lord and then do it, and then our   work will be well done and acceptable   before the Lord, but if we take a course  against light and against the Spirit of   God, we will find it an unprofitable   road to travel.    I feel as though the Lord is going   to do a great work in the midst of this  people.  There are a great many things  at our door, a great many changes to   take place in the earth, and the king-  dom is growing; and I would here   exhort all the Latter day Saints who  hear me this day to study well the   position you are in, and search your  hearts and see if we are in the favour of  the Lord our God, and then let us in-  crease continually in faith, in hope, in  righteousness, and in every virtuous  principle which is necessary for us to  have to sustain us in every trial   through which we may be called to  pass, in order to prove us as the   friends of God, whether we will abide  in the covenant or not; we will be   tried from this time, until the coming   of the Messiah or while we live on the  earth.    If we could open the vision of our  minds, and let it extend into the fu-  ture and see this kingdom, and what  it is bound to accomplish, and what  we have to do, the warfare we have to  pass through, we would certainly see  that we have a great work on hand.    We have not only to fight the powers   of darkness, the invisible forces that  surround us, but we have to war with  a great many outward circumstances  and to contend with a great many dif-  ficulties that we must of necessity  meet, and the more of this we have to  meet the more we should be stimula-  ted to action, and to labour with all   our power before the Lord for the es-  tablishment of righteousness and truth  and the building up of the work of   God, and to see that His name is  honoured upon the earth.    Brother Wells has said, why the  world is troubled about us is because  we are united. This is true; the   world and the devil are afraid of it,   and he has laboured all his life to di-  vide everything where righteousness   dwelt, or at least ever since he was   cast out from the presence of God,  what he did before that I cannot say   any further than what is revealed.    We have got to be one and labour to-  gether to build up this kingdom be-  cause we cannot establish it upon any  other principle.    We should be careful to know that  we are right and then go ahead, and   we will find it to our advantage, and we   shall be satisfied with our reward if   we pursue that course which is ac-  cording to the commandments of God.   When we come into the presence of   our Father in heaven we shall meet   with His approbation, this alone will  reward us for our labours.    If we go to work and build up the   kingdom of God instead of ourselves,  it is no matter in what shape we do  it, whether it is in building a canal,   or in building a temple, preaching   the Gospel, cultivating the earth, or  anything else, let us take that and  make it a business, and we will   find the Lord will help, sustain,   and nerve us with His power, and   will assist us in everything we have   to do, and if we are called to lay   down our lives in the defence of God  and eternal truth, then all right, and  if we live, all right, and when we  come into the presence of the Lord  we shall be satisfied with our reward  and blessings.    The Lord has said He would prove  us whether we would abide in His  covenant even unto death; indeed we  have been tried from the commence- 
 INTELLIGENCE COMES FROM GOD, ETC.           231    ment of this great work, but there  has been an invisible hand at work  for our defence all the time; the  wicked have not seen the power that   has sustained us, they cannot see the  inside machinery that is at work in  this kingdom, the nations of the earth  cannot understand it, and they never  can comprehend it, but the Latter-  day Saints understand it, and they   know that it is the power of God and the  word of God, for the Lord has made   proclamations and decrees, and cove-  nants concerning Israel in the last   days, and all the Prophets, from   righteous Abel to Brigham Young,  have proclaimed it to the nations of   the earth, as with the voice of thun-  der, and we know they will be fulfil-  led; we know the Gospel has to be   offered to the Gentiles first, we have   offered it to them for the space of   twenty-five years, that we may be pre-  pared to go to the house of Israel.    The Gentiles in a great measure,   have rejected it; we have borne a   faithful testimony to the nations of  the earth, and they prefer to take   their own course, and act on their own  agency; they would rather build them-  selves up than the kingdom of God.   The consequence is, it will soon be   taken from the Gentile nations, and it   will not be long before the judgments   of God are abroad among them, and   those bitter branches will be taken off   the tree.    Now there is no personage, or sub-  ject, or work upon the face of the   whole earth, but what is more popular  than the Lord, and His Gospel, and   kingdom; His name is dishonoured   and blasphemed, with impunity by   nearly all the inhabitants of the earth  and in the midst of every nation un-  der heaven, but the day is nigh at   hand when He will make bare His  arm of power, and show the world that  there is a God in Israel, who will no   longer bear the blasphemies of the   wicked without bringing them to judg-  ment, but He will send forth those  angels, those messengers who dwell  in the presence of God, who are  waiting with their sharp sickles in  their hands to reap down the earth;  but this will not be until the Gospel  has been fully offered to the Gentiles;  then the bitter branches will be bro-  ken off.    This kingdom will go forward, for   the Lord God has decreed it, and  Zion will arise and be adorned with  beauty and power, and true refine-  ment, in light and knowledge, and in   every good gift that will prepare the   minds of men for the Society of their  Heavenly Father and of celestial   beings.  These lessons have got to be  given, and we have to learn them,   and we have got to bring ourselves to  the celestial law of God; we have to   be quickened by the Spirit and power  of the kingdom of God and its righ-  teousness, that we may be prepared to  carry out the purposes of the Lord;   then this kingdom will be borne to  the house of Israel, and they will re-  ceive it.    The door has already been unlocked  to the Lamanites in these mountains,   and they will begin to embrace the   Gospel and the records of their fa-  thers, and their chiefs will be filled  with the Spirit and power of God, and   they will rise up in their strength,   and a nation will be born in a day,  because they are of the seed of Abra-  ham, and God has promised to bless   the descendants of Abraham, and they  will be saved with the house of Israel,  for the Lord has spoken it, and made   those promises unto them through  their fathers.    Again, here are the ten tribes of   Israel, we know nothing about them  only what the Lord has said by His  Prophets.  There are Prophets among   them, and by and by they will come   along, and they will smite the rocks,   and the mountains of ice will flow   down at their presence, and a high-

They  will receive their blessings and en-  dowments, from under the children of   Ephraim, who are the first fruits of   the kingdom of God in this dispensa-  tion, and the men will have to be or-  dained and receive their Priesthood  and endowments in the land of Zion,   according to the revelations of God.    Again, here is Judah, which is the   tribe of Israel, from whom Jesus   sprang; how many time have I seen  them among the nations of the earth,  standing in their synagogues, even grey-  haired rabbies, with their faces to the  east, calling on the great Eloheim to  open the door for them to go back to  Jerusalem, the land of their fathers,   and to send their shiloh, their king of  deliverance.  When I have seen this my  soul has been filled with a desire to   proclaim unto them the word of God  unto eternal life, but I knew I could not  do this, the time had not come, I could   not preach to them.  I might have stood  in their midst for a month and preach-  ed unto them Jesus Christ or their   shiloh and king, but I should have   failed to establish one particle of faith  in their minds that he was the true   Messiah.    They do not believe in Jesus Christ;  there is an unbelief resting upon them,  and will until they go home and re-  build Jerusalem and their temple   more glorious than at the beginning,   and then by and by, after this   Church and kingdom has arisen up in  its glory, the Saviour will come to   them and show the wounds in his   hands and side, and they will say to   him, "Where did you get those   wounds?" and he will answer, "In  the house of my friends," and then  their eyes will begin to open, and   they will repent and mourn, they and   their wives apart, and there will be a  fountain opened for uncleanness to the  house of Judah, and they will for the   first time receive Jesus Christ as their  Saviour, they will begin to compre-  hend where they have been wandering  for the space of two thousand years.    You cannot convert a Jew, you may   as well try to convert this house of   solid walls as to convert them into  the faith of Christ.  They are set in   their feelings, and they will be until  the time of their redemption.  They   are looking forward to the time when  they will go home and rebuild Jerusa-  lem; they have looked for it many   hundreds of years, they are looking   for the coming of their king, and they  do not suppose for a moment that he  has already come, but they are looking  for him to come as the Lion of the   tribe of Judah, not as a lamb led to   the slaughter, and as a sheep that is  dumb before his shearers; they are  looking for him to come with power   and great glory.    I thank God that the day is at   hand when the Jews will be restored.  I have felt to pray for them; I feel   interested in their behalf, for they are   of the seed of Abraham and a branch   of the house of Israel, and the pro-  mises of God still remain with them.  It is true they fell through unbelief,   and the kingdom was taken from them   and given to the Gentiles, and when  it came from them, it came clothed   with all its gifts, powers, and glory,  Priesthood and ordinances which  were necessary for the salvation of  men, and to prepare them to dwell in  the presence of the Gods; and when   the kingdom was given to the Gen-  tiles, they for a while brought forth  the natural fruits of the kingdom.  But they, like the Jews, have fallen  through the same example of unbelief,   and now, in the last days, the king-  dom of God has to be taken from the   Gentiles, and restored back to every 
 Elder W.

 REMARKS  By Elder W. WOODRUFF, delivered   in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,  January 1st, 1871.    Reproted by DAVID W. EVANS.    I wish you all a happy new year, and I   hope that we may live to see a good many,  and that we may keep the commandments  of God, obey His laws and have His appro-  bation and blessing upon us as a people.  We have assembled here on this,-the first  day of the week, and the first day of the   year 1871; and this leads my mind to re-  flect upon the age and generation in which  we live, and the great events of the latter  days,-events which involve the interests  and destiny of all the inhabitants of the  earth,-both Zion and Babylon, Jew and  Gentile, Jerusalem, American and the  whole world.  All nations are interested  in the events which are approaching us, and  which await this generation; for whether  the world believe it or not, they are of vast   interest to them all.  There have been cer-  tain times looked forward to in the world's  history, in which it was believed that some-  thing remarkable would occur, and there   have been several of these periods during  the last fifty years.  I do not know that   anything was predicted at an early day  with regard to 1830; but I recollect, when a  boy at school, of reading a certain verse  about a great eclipse of the sun  "In eighteen hundred and thirtyone,  Will be a great eclipse upon the sun."  I heard about this fifteen years before it took   place, it having been foretold by the as-  tronomers, by the principles and laws of   the science of astronomy.  On that day I  was passing through a forest of pinewood,  at Farmington, Connecticut, going to see  my father, whom I had not seen for some  time.  It was nearly as dark as night, and  when I got through, into the open fields,  there was what is termed a poor house, the  only house erected within several miles in  that region of country.  A poor man had  died there and they were drawing his body  on an ox sled and were going to bury him.  I noticed this as I passed along, and thought  of what I had read; but nothing of any par-  ticular interest occured that year except  the eclipse of the sun.  But in 1830 some-  thing occured of great interest to all the   inhabitants of the earth: that was the es-  tablishment of the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter-day Saints.  Many persons have looked forward to   the year 1860 with great interest; and this  has been the case with many of the Latter-  day Saints.  What took place in that year?  The dissolution of the American Union,  for in that year the South took a stand  agains the North, and the North against the  South, in fullfillment of a certain revela  tion given by Joseph Smith, thirty years-  before it took place.  Joseph Smith pre-  dicted that there would be a great rebel-  lion in the United States,- the South and  the North warring against each other, and  that this rebellion would commence in   South Carolina, and would end in the death  and misery of many souls; and that in   process of time,- after many days, the  slaves would rise against their masters, and  that one nation would call for aid upon   another, for war would be poured upon  the whole earth.  I wrote this revelation  twenty-five years before the rebellion took  place; others also wrote it, and it was pub-  lished to the world before there was any  prospect of the fearful events it pre-  dicted coming to pass.  Joseph Smith once said in a speech at   Nauvoo, to a company, that whosoever   lived to see the two sixes come together in   '66 would see the American continent del-  uged in blood.  This was many years be-  fore there was any prospect of a rebellion.  The history of '60 and of '66 is before the  world, and I do not wish to spend time in  referring to it.  We have got by '30, '60, '66 and '70, and  we are now living at a period when every  year is big with events of interest to the  inhabitants of the earth: and they will con-  tinue from this time until the coming o  the Lord Jesus Christ.  Many men have  set times for the coming of the Lord Jesus   Christ, among whom, living in our own  day, we may mention Mr. Miller.  He set  times and days for the appearing of the   Messiah, and has said that He would sure-  ly come on such a day.  Now if Mr. Mil-  ler had been acquainted with the prophecies  contained in the Bible, and with the spirit  by which the scriptures were written, he  would have known very clearly that  Christ would not come until certain events  had taken place.  He would have been  aware that the Messiah would not make  His appearance until an angel of God had  delivered the everlasting gospel from the  heavens to be preached to the nations of the  earth; until the honest and meek of the  earth are gathered out from every sect,  party and denomination under the whole  heavens; until the Zion of God had gone up  into the mountains of Israel and there es-  tablished Zion, and lifted up a standard to  the people.  Mr. Miller and all who have  believed like him, had they understood the  scriptures and possessed the spirit of truth,  would hav known that Christ would not  come until the Jews had returned to their  own land and had rebuilt the city of Jerusa-  lem and the temple there; they would have  known that all these and many other pro-  phecies must have been fulfilled as a pre-   
 INTELLIGENCE COMES FROM GOD, ETC. 233    branch and tribe of the house of  Israel; and when it is restored to  them, it must go back with all its  gifts, and blessings, and Priesthood  which it possessed when it was taken   from them.  But the Lord has said   that in restoring these blessings to the  children of Abraham, that He would   be inquired of by the house of Israel,  to do it for them.  But from what   branch or part of the house of Israel   will the Lord look for this petition or  request to issue, if not from the Lat-  ter-day Saints, for we are out of the  tribe of Joseph through the loins of  Ephraim, who have been as mixed  cake among the Gentiles, and are the  first fruits of the kingdom, and the   Lord has given unto us the kingdom  and Priesthood and keys thereof.    Hence the Lord will require us to   ask for those blessings which are pro-  mised unto Israel, and to labour for  their salvation.    These things will be required at  our hands; a great work is before us,  a work worthy of intelligent beings--  worthy of the most noble of spirits   that ever existed around the throne  of God in time or in eternity, in hea-  ven or on the earth.  Then, if we   would feel right about this important  subject, and look upon it as it is, we  will go to work and labour with all  our mights to build up the kingdom of  our God, to carry out the purposes of  the Lord, in the building up of Zion,  the establishment of his kingdom, and  restoration, and salvation of the house  of Israel; we should listen strictly to  those men who are the word of the   Lord to us.    The Prophet Jeremiah saw this   kingdom established, and saw that  Ephraim was the first born, and in  gathering the children of Jacob and   establishing Zion in the last days,   their nobles should be of themselves,   and their governor should proceed   from the midst of them.  I have   looked forward for years by faith to  that time when the children of Zion   would have the privilege of having   their rulers, and a governor of their  own choice of the house of Israel, to   rule over them and counsel and lead   them.    We have had a governor since we  have been a Territory, who is actually   of the loins of Joseph, the son of   Jacob. Jeremiah saw this, spake of it,  and it has been fulfilled.  There has  been a great exertion to make this  prophecy fail.  It hurts the feelings of  the Gentiles to think this prophecy   should have its fulfilment in these  days.  It has been fulfilled so far, and  I feel thankful to-day that all the   prophecies which have not been fulfil-  led will be; hence I have hope and   confidence in looking forward to the  fulfilment of the blessings that are   promised to us.    Let us be faithful and seek dili-  gently to build up the kingdom of  God in righteousness and do our duty,   and try to save ourselves, our wives,  and children, our kindred and our  friends, and the house of Israel, and  also the Gentiles as far as they will be  saved, and then we will be satisfied   with our reward which we shall obtain  in this life and in the world to come.   I pray the Lord to bless us all, and  save us in His kingdom, for Christ's  sake.  Amen. 
 Jan. 11                                 THE DESERET NEWS.  paratory work for the coming of the Mes-  siah.    These things are before us; we are here  in these valleys of the mountains, as the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, established by the hand of God,---  by revelation from heaven. This church  has been established by raising up pro-  phets, unto whom have been given the  keys of the kingdom of God,---the keys of  the holy priesthood and Apostleship of the  Son of God, with power to organize the  church and kingdom of God on the earth,  with all its gifts, graces, ordinances and  orders, as proclaimed by all the apostles  and prophets who have lived since  the world began. It is because of this that  we are here to-day. In fulfillment of proph-  ecy and revelation we have established a  kingdom, as it were, a state, a nation, a  people here in the deserts of North Amer-  ica. We have planted six hundred miles of  cities, towns, villages, gardens, orchards,  tabernacles, and temples by the command  of God, for the hand of God is in all these  things, and they are in fulfillment of revel-  ations given in the Bible, Book of Mormon  and Doctrine and Covenants, in our day  and in ancient days. This is the work of  the Lord, and all the scriptures, from the  beginning of Genesis to the end of Revela-  tion point to this day as one of great inter-  est to all the human family; although as  one said of old, "As it was in the days of  Noah and of Lot so shall it be in the days  of the coming of the Son of Man." In those  days they were marrying and giving in  marriage, and when Noah went into the  Ark, and when Lot fled out of Sodom, the  inhabitants of the earth through their un-  belief were ignorant of the destruction  awaiting them.    At the present day darkness covers the  earth and gross darkness the minds of the  people; nevertheless they are living in an  age of the world more fraught with interest  to the human family than any preceding  age or generation since the creation. There  is no hundred years, no thousand years,  no two thousand years since God made this  world and placed Adam in the Garden of  Eden when there was as much prophecy,  revelation, vision and word of the Lord  and promises of God to be fulfilled as there  is in the generation in which you and I  live. This is the great dispensation of all  dispensations. This is the time to which  all the prophets of God have pointed, and  in which they have declared the great latter  day work of God should be established.  And I will here say that, many times,   while a boy, when reading the testimony  of John, given on the isle of Patmos,  whither he had been banished for the testi-  mony of Jesus Christ, and for the word of  God; while reading the account he gives of  the pouring out of plagues and judgments  on the inhabitants of the earth, I have mar-  velled that the Lord should do such a work.  But I do not wonder at it to-day: the  scenes have changed. When I was a boy,  fifty years ago, the kingdom of God had not  been established among men; the angels of  God had not visited the earth; the Lord  Almighty had not clothed His servants  with the priesthood and commanded them  to go and warn the nations of the earth of  the judgments which awaited them.  There was not the wickedness then that  there is to-day. The wickedness com-  mitted to-day in the Christian world in  twenty-four hours is greater than would  have been committed in a hundred years  at the ratio of fifty years ago. And the  spirit of wickedness is increasing, so that I  no longer wonder that God Almighty will  turn rivers into blood; I do not wonder that  He will open the seals and pour out the  plagues and sink great Babylon, as the  angel saw, like a millstone cast into the  sea, to rise no more for ever. I can see  that it requires just such plagues and judg-  ments to cleanse the earth, that it may  cease to groan under the wickedness and  abomination in which the Christian world  welters to-day. I can see the necessity for  the Lord stretching forth His hand, estab-  lishing His kingdom, warning the nations,  and gathering out the honest and meek of  the earth from among all nations, kindreds,  tongues and people, sects and parties under  the whole heaven, and preparing them to  stand as the bride, the Lamb's wife, as the  Church of Jesus Christ, as the kingdom of  God, adorned with goodly apparel, adorned  with the light of Zion, with the principles  of eternal life, with the gospel of Jesus  Christ, preserving within themselves the  virtues and attributes which have made  God what He is, established Him on His   throne, and given Him the power which  He now possesses. I can say this,---the  Lored will never come to visit an earth like  this; He will never come to visit a gener-  ation of the inhabitants of the earth until  they are prepared for His coming and are   willing to receive Him.    This is the foundation of Mormonism;  this is the foundation of the Church and  kingdom of God, which was laid in 1830.  The church was established on the 6th of  April in that year. Its history and the  history of this people are before the world.  We ourselves have learned it by shoe-  leather. Many of the Elders of Israel have  travelled a hundred thousand miles to  preach the gospel during the last forty  years without purse or scrip; we have la-  bored day and night, and traveled as no  other generation of men since the world  was made have travelled. Our garments  are clear of the blood of this generation, at  least many of us, and I hope many more  will be. We have been true and faithful in  our testimony to the inhabitants of the  earth; and as the world generally has re-  jected our testimony the Lord has with-  drawn His spirit from the people in a  great measure; and the religion they once  enjoyed is as nothing to many of them.  Infidelity prevails throughout the world;  very few, either priests or people, believe  in a literal fulfilment of the Bible. They  have a theory, but as to believing in a real  fulfilment of prophecy, or that the Lord  meant what He said and said what He  meant, that is out of the question,---very  few believe it.    I want to ask a question:---Will the un-  belief of this generation make the truth of  God without effect in our day any more  than it has in any other age of the world? I  tell you nay, and think not, as Paul says,  that I am your enemy because I te^l^l you  the truth. These things are true before  God; this is the Zion of God, and these are  the people of God; and we, as Latter-day  Saints, should live our religion better than  we do; and as we are now entering on an-  other year I hope we shall try to live our  religion through this year, and do our duty  and keep the commandments of God and  walk uprightly before Him, that we may  become united as the heart of one man.    There are great events, as I have already  said, before us. The fact is, the Lord has  laid down a great many premises concern-  ing the latter days, and they are going to  be fulfilled; for though the heavens and the  earth pass away not one jot or tittle of the  word of the Lord will fall unfilled; and  when our nation and the nations of the  earth have filled their cup and are ripened  in iniquity the Lord will cut them off.  The greater the battle the sooner it will end;  the greater the warfare the greater the  victory, if the Saints do their duty. These  things are before my mind, in the vision of  it, and the Lord will not fail in anything  He has promised concerning the work of  the latter days. Whatever opposition this  church and kingdom may have, it is the  work of God. The Lord has planted and  sustained it. Jesus compares the Kingdom  of Heaven to a mustard seed, the least of all  seeds, but by and by when it grows it be-  comes a large tree, so the fowls of the air  can lodge in its brances. So it has been  with the Kingdom of God; but we are told  that the little one will become a thousand,  and the small one a strong nation, and  the Lord will hasten it in His own time.  The Lord says "I will break every weapon  formed against Zion; and every nation,  kindred, tongue and people that will not  serve Zion shall be utterly wasted away."    When I see the world making warfare  against the Zion and people of God because  they have borne record and testimony of  His work on the earth I can tell pretty  well what the end will be, I can see it. We  are living in a time when the work of God  is going to increase in interest every day  until it is wound up. No man knows the  day or the hour when Christ will come,  yet the generation has been pointed out by  Jesus himself. He told His disciples when  they passed by the temple as they walked  out of Jerusalem that that generation  should not pass away before not one stone  of that magnificent temple should be left  standing upon another and the Jews should  be scattered among the nation; and his-  tory tells how remarkably that prediction  was fulfilled. Moses and the prophets also  prophecied of this as well as Jesus.  The Savior, when speaking to His disci-  ples of His second coming and the estab-  lishment of His Kingdom on the earth,  said the Jews should be scattered and trod-  den under foot until the times of the Gen-  tiles were fulfilled. But, said He,  when you see light breaking forth among  the Gentiles, referring to the preaching of  His gospel amongst them; when you see  salvation offered to the Gentiles, and the  Jews,---the seed of Israel, passed by,---the  last first and the first last; when you see  this you may know that the time of my  second coming is at hand as surely as you  know that summer is nigh when the fig  tree puts forth its leaves; and when these  things commence that generation shall not  pass away until all are fulfilled.    We are living in the dispensation and   generation to which Jesus referred;---the  time appointed by God for the last six thou-  sand years, through the mouths of all the  prophets and inspired men who have lived  and left their sayings on record, in which  His Zion should be built up and continue  upon the earth. These prophecies will  have their fulfillment before the world; and  a^l^l who will not repent will be engulphed  in the destructions which are in store for  the wicked. If men do not cease from   their murders, whoredoms, and all the  wickedness and abominations which fill  the black catalogue of the crimes of the  world, judgment will overtake them; and  whether we are believed or not, these say-  ings are true, and I bear my testimony as  a servant of God and as an Elder in Israel  to the truth of the events which are going  to follow very fast on each other.    The Lord is going to make a short work  in the earth; He is going to cut it short in  righteousness, or no flesh would be saved.  What Brother Rich has said to-day is true.  These principles will sustain us. Virtuous  and godly principles---the principles of the  gospel will, in the end, come off triumphant;  and they will sustain and preserve any  people who practice them, whether they  are popular or not in the estimation of the  world. All who embrace the principles of  the gospel of Christ will be saved by them.  He that abides a law will be preserved by it.  Any man who abides the law of the gosepl  will be saved and receive exaltation  and glory by it. Let us remember these   things, for all that has been spoken con-  cerning this Zion of God in the mountains  will come to pass. It is the work of God,  and His eyes are over it; the heavens be-  hold it. Every prophet and apostle who  ever bore testimony to this work, is watch-  ing us with the deepest interest; they watch  our labors and faithfulness, and are anxious  about the course we pursue. Many of them  desired to live in our day, but had not the   privilege. We have been permitted to see   and live in this great and eventful age of the  world. The God of heaven has put into  our hands the gospel, the priesthood, the  keys of His kingdom, and the power to re-  deem the earth from the dominion of sin  and wickedness under which it has groaned  for centuries, and under which it groans to-  day. Let us lay these things to heart, and  try to live our religion; so that when we get  through we may look back on our lives,  and feel that we have done what was re-  quired of us, individually and collectively.  The Lord requires much at our hands,---  more than He has ever required of any  generation that has preceded us; for no  generation that has ever lived on the earth  was called upon to establish the kingdom  of God on the earth, knowing that it should  be thrown down no more for ever. Daniel  saw this; the Prophet Isaiah has spoken of it;  in fact three-fourths of all his predictions  relate to the establishment of the kingdom of  God in the latter days; to our persecutions,  to our travels to these valleys of the moun-  tains, to the lifting up of the standard to  the people on the mountains of Israel; to  the casting up of the great highway---this  national railroad, which the ransomed of  the Lord should walk over, and on which  the Gentiles should come to the light of  Zion, and kings to the brightness of her  rising.    These things are to come to pass in our  day, and the beginning has commenced,  and the end will come by the power of  God and in fulfillment of His promises;  and it is at our hands the work is required.  Therefore I feel to bear my testimony to-  day that this is the work of God, that  Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and  that Brigham Young is a prophet of God,  and is inpsired, led, dictated and directed  of the Lord, and has been very profitable  to the Latter-day Saints, and is doing all  he can for the salvation of the world. So  did Joseph Smith, while he lived. He  came in fulfillment of prophecy, accom-  plished what was required of him, laid  the foundation of the work, received the  keys of the priesthood and apostleship, and  every gift and grace in the organization of  the church necessary to carry it on. We   are called to build on the foundation he   laid, until Zion shall arise and put on her  beautiful garments and the people of God  become united as the heart of one man;  until the little stone, cut out of the moun-  tain without hands becomes a mountain  and fills the whole earth, and accomplishes  all God has spoken concerning it.    Brethren and sisters let us unite together  and be faithful, and live our religion every  day, and do our duty in 1871 as in any of  the years that are past and gone since we  have been acquainted with the Gospel of  Christ. If we do this we shall come off  triumphant. The God of heaven is our  friend, and blessed is that people whose  God is the Lord. Blessed is that people  who do not turn to any other God but the  living and true God.    May God bless you, bless this assembly,  bless us as a people, and the honest and  meek of the earth everywhere, and prepare  us for the great events which await this  generation for Jesus' sake, Amen. 
 NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL, ETC.    DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  DELIVERED IN THE NEW TABERNACLE, SALT LAKE CITY, SUNDAY  AFTERNOON, SEPTEMBER 16, 1877.    (Reported by Geo. F. Gibbs.)    NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL—THIRTY YEARS PROGRESS IN THE  MOUNTAINS—THE GOSPEL UNCHANGABLE—JOSEPH INSPIRED—PRESI-  DENT YOUNG'S WORK—WORK OF THE TWELVE—LABORS IN ST.  GEORGE TEMPLE—GATHERING OF THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD.    It is with much pleasure and sa-  tisfaction I again stand before the  Saints of God in this Tabernacle.  A year nearly has passed since I en-  joyed this privilege, my labors hav-  ing been directed elsewhere. What-  ever I may say to you depends en-  tirely upon the dictation of the Holy  Spirit. And I may say that we all  need the inspiration of the Almighty  to dictate us, whether we preach or  listen, and not only in our public  gatherings but in all of our labors  connected with the building up of the  kingdom of God, yes, just as much  as the Saints of God did in every  past age and dispensation.    I can truly say as the Apostle Paul   said, "For I am not ashamed of the  Gospel of Christ; for it is the power  of God unto salvation to every one  that believeth." [##Romans 1:16##] I am not ashamed  of what the world is pleased to call  "Mormonism;" I am not ashamed  of any revelation that God has given  unto the Latter-day Saints, through  the mouth of modern Prophets; I  am not ashamed to acknowledge my-  self a firm believer in the literal ful-  filment of the Bible, as well as every  communication of God to man, al-  though I am well aware that the  Scriptures have been more or less  spiritualized by the whole Christian  world, especially during the last  hundred years. I believe that holy  men of old wrote and spoke as they  were moved upon by the Holy Ghost,  and that they meant what they said  and said what they meant, and that  the Apostle Paul spoke truly when  he said, "that no prophecy of the   Scripture is of any private interpre-  tation." [##2 Peter 1:20##] The Lord has taught us in   a modern revelation contained in  this book, the "Doctrine and Cove-  nants," that it matters not whether  he speaks from heaven by his own  voice, or by the ministration of an-  gels, or by the mouth of his servants  when they are moved upon by the   Holy Ghost, it is all the same the  mind and will of God; and although  the heavens and earth pass away,  my words would not fall unfulfilled. [##Doctrine and Covenants 1:38##]    I desire more particularly to ad-  dress myself, this afternoon, to the   Latter-day Saints; and at the same  time if any of the strangers present  can receive any benefit from my re- 
 Elder Wilford Woodruf addressed the Conference  upon the building up of the Kingdom of God  that being the purpose for which we have gathered.    Dwelt at lenght upon the working of the United Order  at Brigham City. He touched upon the Subjects  of Union and labor, the building of Temples; the  necessity of the sealing ordinances that men might  receive their wives and children again behind the veil;  the importance of training the young and of the  Y. M. M. I. Associations, the judgements that are  coming upon the Earth; and the privilege of all to  receive revelations from the Lord to guide them as  individuals. 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    marks, I shall be glad of it.    Our position, to-day, before the  heavens and the earth and before  each other, reminds me of days that  are past and gone. On the 20th of  July, 1847, I brought our late Presi-  dent Young in my carriage through  Emigration Canyon into this val-  ley, which was the first time he set  foot upon this land. The question   has been often asked by strangers  who visit our city, why did Brig-  ham Young pick upon this spot to  build a city? Because it was shown   him before he came here. But   when we came to this country, what  did we find here? A barren desert,  as barren as the Desert of Sahara;  and the only signs of life were a few  black crickets, some cayote wolves,  and a few poor wandering Indians.  To-day we may travel from Paris in  the north of our Territory to St.   George in the south, a distance of   some 500 miles, and see on every  hand towns and villages, gardens,  and orchards, fields and crops; we  behold a people industrious and  happy, building their own dwelling-  houses, meeting-houses, school-houses,  tabernacles and Temples, and im-  provements and enterprises are con-  stantly going on. And all this  within so short a time. What does  this mean? What does it bespeak  to the strangers who visit our Terri-  tory, and in fact to the whole world,  and to heavenly as well as mortal  beings? It is evidence that God  has set his hand to fulfil the predic-  tion contained in the Bible, that he  has commenced the work of uniting  the record or stick of Joseph with  that of Judah; that the set time  has come for him to favor Zion.  And how have these things come  to pass and what was the origin  of this peculiar system that presents  itself now to the inhabitants of the  earth, which found a resting-place in  the wilds of this desolate, uninhabited  land, and which has already produced  such marvellous results? It was  performed in a very singular manner,  to begin with. As the Lord ever has  done in attempting to establish his  rule and government on the earth,  he chose the weak things of the   earth, and them he will use to con-  found the wisdom of the wise. He  manifested himself to a boy in his  teens, and also sent an angel to  him on several occasions, in fulfil-  ment of the revelation to John the  Revelator, and of the inspired words  of many other Prophets and Apostles  who have spoken concerning the  marvellous work and wonder of the  latter-days. But says the world,  "We do not believe that." We un-  derstand that perfectly well; we do  not expect you to receive the Gospel   of the Son of God with the same  readiness that you believe the false-  hoods and misrepresentations that  are constantly made about it. The  world ever has opposed it, and we  expect to meet all manner of opposi-  tion until the final triumph of right  over wrong, of truth over error. We  might commence with father Adam  and trace it down to the present time,  and we would find that the same  spirit of opposition and of persecu-  tion followed the people of God in  every age, as exists to-day against  us, as a people. And so natural is  it for the devil to oppose every move  that the Lord makes towards re-  claiming and redeeming the earth,  that men are often found to de-  nounce the "Mormons" and their  religion when they know nothing  either of us or our tenets. The Sa-  vior of the world himself was de-  nounced as a deceiver, as an imposter;  why? Because those who raised  this cry against him knew him not,  and those who re-echoed it took not  the trouble to ascertain whether it 
 NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL, ETC.    was true or false. And it has been  precisely in the same way that the  names of Joseph Smith and Brig-  ham Young have been had for evil  by the masses of this enlightened  age. The Savior said of those that  rejected him, that he was hated by  them because he testified of their  works, which were evil. And so  verily it might be said of those who  decry against the men who, in this  respect have not been more favored  than their Master. Through them  light has dawned upon the world,  and because men choose darkness  rather than light, their deeds being  evil, they find their opposite in  "Mormonism," and in all those who  faithfully adhere to it and advocate  it.    Through this boy, inexperienced  and unlearned as he was, the Lord  organized this Church on the 6th  day of April, 18[3]0, with only six  members; and it can be said of him  as of no other man in Christendom,  that he was the instrument in the   hands of God of presenting to the   world a system of religion, a Church  organization complete with all the  keys and powers of the Holy Priest-  hood, and that through him has  been imparted to the religious world  more light and knowledge than all  the professors of religion combined,  with all their boasted intelligence  and learning. And when he pub-  lished to the world this new yet old  doctrine, even the everlasting Gos-  pel, it was found to agree precisely   with that taught by the Savior, and  the Church organization was after  the same pattern as the one insti-  tuted by Him, although the Gospel  had not been preached since it was  driven away from the earth by the  iron hand of persecution. One of  the peculiar features in the faith of  the Latter-day Saints is that we be-  lieve there is but one Gospel, that  there never has been nor never will be  any other, and that that Gospel never  changes from one generation to ano-  ther, and that it consists of the sim-  ple principles taught by the Savior  and contained in the New Testament,  which principles never deviate one  from another. The first was faith  in the Lord Jesus Christ; the se-  cond was baptism in water by im-  mersion for the remission of sins,  and then the laying on of hands for  the reception of the Holy Ghost;  and this was the kind of doctrine  taught by Christ and his Apostles,  and this was the doctrine that Jo-  seph Smith preached. In doing so  he stood alone in the world, and he  had to meet the traditions of eighteen  hundred years, traditions which had  been handed down from generation  to generation, which were entirely  opposed to the doctrine which the  Lord had revealed to him, and which  he was commanded to preach. You  and I were taught from our youth  that there was no such thing as new  revelation, it was all done away;  and this same tradition is being im-  bibed by the youth of Christendom  to the present time. Ask the min-  isters, the men to whom people look  as their spiritual guides, why they do  not enjoy the gifts and graces and the  light of revelation from heaven, and  what is the universal reply? It is  in substance, "Oh, these things are   all done away, they are no longer  needed; it was necessary that they  should exist in the dark ages of the  world but not in these days of the  blaze of Gospel light." Whenever  God had a Church upon the earth-  these gifts were enjoyed by the peo-  ple. The sick were healed of their  sickness, the lame were made to walk,  the blind to see, the dumb to speak,  etc., through the administrations  of those among them who held the  Priesthood, which authorizes men 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff was  the next speaker. He en-  dorsed the remarks of Brother  Smith. He felt they were due.  Such occasions as these were admo-  nitions to us. In Adam all died, but   in Christ all were made alive. Before  the speaker became acquinted with  the fulness of the Gospel death had  to him an appalling gloom. Since  then, however, he had felt to mourn  but little at the death of any Lat-  ter-day Saint. The speaker had   been acquinted with Brother  Hooper a good many years. In his   Congressional career he had faith-  fully represented the people. This   probation was short, but it was as   important as any position we ever  had or even would occupy, in its re-  lation to eternity. Inasmuch as the   family of the deceased were faithfnl  they would again receive a home in  association with their head and pro-  tector. A good many of those who  had been a long time associated   with the work of God would probab-  ly soon pass to where Brother Hooper  had gone. It would amply pay us  to do all the good we could in  this life, that we might all  rejoice together in the future. Bro-  ther Hooper was an affection-  ate husband and father, a kindly  friend, and he would be greatly  missed in the channels in which he  moved. But we could not keep   him here. The speaker concluded   with a forcible exhortation to his  hearers to live in such a way in this  life that they would secure eternal  happiness in that beyond.

CANNON,    AND    PRESIDENTS WILFORD WOODRUFF & JOHN TAYLOR,    [Italics] In the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sunday Afternoon, June 29, [End of Italics]    1884.

Elder John Q. Cannon said : My  brethren and sisters and freinds,  it is with feelings which I am utterly  unable to express that I stand before  you this afternoon—feelings on the   one hand of gratitude to my Heav-  enly Father, that after an absence of  nearly three years from this city I  am again permitted to meetwith my  brethren and sisters in this place,  and with feelings on the other hand  of intense timidity in standing be-  fore so large an audience. But I   rely, my brethren and sisters, upon  your faith and prayers during the  few moments that I may stand before  you, and I rely, furthermore, upon  the promise which our Lord gave,  when He said, " Where two or three  have gathered together in my name,  there I am in the midst of them."  I am satisfied, on my own part, that  we, this afternoon have assembled  ourselves in the name of the Lord,  and I am consequently satisfied that  His Spirit will be with us inasmuch  as we seek for the same, inasmuch  as we rid ourselves of every feeling  of worldliness and come together  with pure hearts to partake of the   emblems of the death and suffering  of our Lord, and to become in-  structed in the plan which He has  laid down for our salvation.    It four days since I returned from  a mission, and in six weeks it will  have been three years since I left  this city, in obedience to a call made  upon me by the authorities of the  Church. On the 9th of August,  1881, I left this city on a mission to  Great Britain, in company with  eleven other missionaries, who were  destined for Scandinavia. We

 Wilford Woodruff, one of the twelve   apostles, then took the stand, He de-  livered the same sermon verbatim [illegible]  [illegible] that he has delivered from  time immemorial from the same stand.  He said, "We occupy an entirely dif-  ferent position from the rest of the   world in regard to the principles of  the gospel. There has never been an  apostle on the earth from Adam's time  down to the present who has not had  to suffer persecution. The earth is  filled with the power of darkness and  the power of light. Lucifer and his   [illegible] cohor[ts] were driven out of heaven,   and the devil don't care what you  preach so long as you don't preach the  gospel of Christ.    God had a father and a grandfather  and the grandfather had a father, and  so had the sun and the moon and the  stars a father. God has [illegible] revela-  tion in these last days, and this gospel  is true and we know it. Very few men  have strength of charactor enough or   have enough independence of mind to  embrace this gospel and undergo the  persecutions which it entails. The  moment you embrace this gospel you  incur the condemnation of the press  and the pulpit of the country. We are  opposed, as you know, by the whole  Christian world.    Well, there is that talk about polyg-  amy. Well, what about it? Why we   were persecuted in Missouri and 10000  of us driven out of Jackson county be-  fore we ever practiced polygamy.  What does the world care about our  polygamy? It is used by them merely  as a [illegible] against us. We  practice polygamy for the same  reason that we practice all our other  ordinances, because we are commanded  by revelation to do so. Look at how  many women are saved for eternity by  it! Why not be in a position to claim  your wives and children after death?  There is where I stand and that is  where President Taylor stands and  that is where the prophet Joseph  Smith and President Brigham Young  stood.    The Gentiles say you take these  wives to gatify your lust. We answer  that by saying "Ain't there a way in   the Christian world by which we  could satisfy our lusts in a cheaper  way and without having so much  trouble? If we married only for  lustful purposes we would not be very  wise. We look upon adultery as next  to robbery. God gave Abraham and  Isaac more wives in order that they  might have them after death.    Without the pristhood this ordin-  ance could not be performed. We shall  puursue this course as long as God sees  fit for us to pursue it. The heavens   are full of revelations, full of light and  truth, and the Holy Ghost continues to  give revelations. I pray to God to give  us grace to allow us to magnify our  calling." 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    Adversary and wicked men to de-  stroy him from off the earth. His  works are before you; they are be-  fore the heavens and the earth, and  all men. The entire Territory bears  marks of his genius and enterprise;  and the Lord certainly crowned  his labors with success, as he has  blessed the labors of his brethren  who have not spared their hands  or their hearts in assisting him.  And instead of the work of the  latter-day stopping, or its progress  being retarded in consequence of  the death of our beloved President,  it will move forward with accelerated  speed, until Zion arises in beauty,  and power, and dominion, in fulfil-  ment of the inspired words of Pro-  phets and Seers who have spoken,  and who, while wrapt in heavenly   vision, saw our day.    It cannot be a very great while  before many of us will follow him.  I have traveled with him for some   forty-four years of my life, and   during those years I have never  known him to waver or flinch in  the performance of his duties. He  has performed an honorable mission  to earth, and while his body sleeps  his spirit lives, and he continues  his labors, strengthening the hands  of Joseph, and Hyrum, and Jede-  diah, and Heber, and George A.,  and all those who have been true  and faithful to God and to man  while upon the earth, who are now  engaged in the same great cause of  redemption and salvation. Although  President Young has finished his  earthly career and mission to this  earth, the work has only commenced.  The Gospel must be thoroughly and  faithfully preached to every nation  under heaven, and the Lord holds  us responsible, for verily the trust  has been imposed upon us, and it  behooves us to see to it. I have  traveled more or less for the last  forty years, without purse or scrip,  and I have been sustained by the  hand of the Lord, and so have my   brethren. Our Elders who are called  constantly from the plow and the  workshops to go forth into the world  and preach the Gospel, traveling  from place to place on foot, without  purse or scrip, and although they are  not trained in colleges or seminaries  of learning, yet they are sustained   and enabled to cope with the learned  and wise, and the honest in heart  receive their testimony, which is  accompanied by the Spirit of God,  and the Holy Ghost.    Before I close, I want to say one  thing to the Latter-day Saints, which  is resting upon my mind. President  Young having now passed away, his   labors with us have ceased for the  present. He, with his brethren,  built and completed one Temple,  also laid the foundation for one at  Manti and one at Logan, and besides  a great deal of work has been done  on the one in this city. He left this   unfinished work for us to carry on to  completion; and it is our duty to   rise up and build these Temples. I  look upon this portion of our min-  istry as a mission of as much import-  ance as preaching to the living; the  dead will hear the voice of the ser-  vants of God in the spirit-world,  and they cannot come forth in the  morning of the resurrection, unless  certain ordinances are performed,   for and in their behalf, in Temples   built to the name of God. It takes  just as much to save a dead man as  a living man. For the last eighteen  hundred years, the people that have  lived and passed away never heard  the voice of an inspired man, never  heard a Gospel sermon, until they  entered the spirit-world. Somebody  has got to redeem them, by per-  forming such ordinances for them  in the flesh as they cannot attend 
 TESTIMONY GAINED. 203    reached Liverpool in due time, and  I wasassigned,shortlyaftermyarrival  there, to the London Conference,  where I labored with great pleasure  until the 17th of March, 1882.  Early in the month the then Presi-  dent of the European Mission—  Apostle Albert Carrington—notified  me that I should proceed to the   German Mission, and within a few  days after receiving this notice I  joined my brotherin NorthGermany.  Of course in going to Germany I had  to learn the language ; I was utterly  ignorant of it when I started and  when I landed there ; but the Lord  strengthened my memory, and in a  short time I was able to make myself  understood, and pursue the real  object of my mission. I labored—  it is not for me to say with how much  success—until relieved a short time  ago to return home.    I can say, my brethren and sis-  ters, that I have enjoyed my mission  greatly. The blessing of the Lord  has been with me. The promises  that were sealed upon my head by  the Presidency before I went have  been literally fulfilled, and, to my  mind, in a most remarkable man-  ner.    Above all things I prizemymission  for the testimony it has given me of  the truth of this Gospel. It may  seem strange to you that I make this  assertion ; because one would natu-  rally think that I had a testimony  before I went. I, however, confess  this was not the case. I had heard  what the world calls Mormonism—  from my childhood up I had heard  nothing else. I believed as much  as it was possible that this, the Gos-  pel as preached by the Elders of the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints,was the true religion, and  was the path of redemption as pro-  claimed by Jesus Christand His Apos-  tles. This was my firm belief. But  a direct and firm and steadfast testi-  mony of the truth of the Gospel I  had not received, and it was to ob-  tain this testimony, more than for  anything else, that I obeyed the call  that was made of me. I had heard,  as you had, that every man who  returned from a mission and rose up  in this stand or elsewhere to proclaim  his testimony and to report his  labors—I had heard every man say :  " I know this is the Gospel of Jesus  Christ." And I felt within myself,  if I can acquire a knowledge of the  truth of the Gospel through going  on a mission, I am willing to go. I  valued my salvation and a knowledge  of the truth of the Gospel just that  much. Well, I went, and I labored  with great weakness, I have no doubt.  But the Lord heard my prayers. He  granted unto me a testimony of the  truth of the Gospel, and from the  time that I received the first one  until this moment, one testimony  has followed another in rapid succes-  sion. I am therefore able to proclaim  before you, as I have done with   much pleasure before the world, that  I do know that God has spoen in  these our days, that He has revealed  Himself and restored his Priesthood  by means of which the human fam-  ily—those of them who are willing  to be saved and to obey the require-  ments which He has given—may be  saved.    It was told me before I started  away—the remark was made to me  by my father : " My son, you will  find in the world that the nations  are about in the same condition as   the Athenians were when Paul went  to preach to them. They have tem-  ples and they have altars built, but  these are dedicated to the ' Unknown  God.' " I found this to be the truth.  I found the word, the written word of  God was read in every church in  every land, and the every family 
 Wilford Woodruff, president of the  church, took the stand and stated he,  too, in former years, had had consider-  able experience as a missionary laborer  in the Southern States. He had met  with considerable opposition in those  days, not only on account of his being  a hated "Yankee," but also on account  of his efforts to baptise slaves. On all  occasions he considered it his duty,  when endeavoring to convert these  slaves, to consult their masters, and  the labor was sometimes not very en-  couraging, and when the consent of  the masters was obtained it was often  without the least consideration on the  part of the slave master as to the wel-  fare of his servant, the response of one  of these masters being characteristic  in this respect: "I don't care," he   said, "what in hell you do with him,  so long as you don't stop him hoeing  corn."    To-day, happily, the eyes of the  world are being opened, and thousands  are learning to know Zion, and the peo-  ple of God who inhabit it.

THE following discourse on "The Law of Adoption" was delivered by  President Wilford Woodruff, at the Sixty-fourth Annual Conference of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, held in the Tabernacle, Salt  Lake City, Sunday morning, April 8, 1894:—    I feel thankful for the privilege of meeting with so many of the Latter-  day Saints this morning. In order to present my position before the  Saints I wish to say that I have been a member of the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints over sixty years, a member of the Quorum of   the Apostles fifty-five years, and the President of the Church for a short  time. During all these years, and in all my travels, I have never seen a  moment when I have had the power to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ  or to administer in any of the ordinances of the House of the Lord,  acceptably to God or to myself, only by the assistance of the Holy Ghost;  and I do not know of any other man that could ever do this. Even the  Son of God, in referring to His work, said: "I do nothing of myself; but  as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things." So it has been with  all the prophets and patriarchs in every age of the world; they have had  to be assisted by the power of God. I occupy that position to-day before  this assembly. Therefore, as the Lord commanded us not to speak only  as we are moved upon by the Holy Ghost, I desire that, and in order to  obtain it I want the prayers and faith of the Latter day Saints.    I have some things resting upon me that I wish to present before the  Latter-day Saints, and in order to do this I will call upon President George  Q. Cannon to read from the Book of Doctrine and Covenants concerning  the subject which I wish to speak upon.    President Cannon read from Sec. 128, as follows:— 
 NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL, ETC.    to themselves in the spirit, and  in order that this work may be  done, we must have Temples in  which to do it; and what I wish to  say to you, my brethren and sisters,  is that the God of heaven requires  us to rise up and build them, that  the work of redemption may be  hastened. Our reward will meet us  when we go behind the vail.    "Blessed are the dead which die  in the Lord from henceforth: Yea,  saith the Spirit, that they may rest  from their labors; and their works  do follow them." [##Revelation 14:13##]    We have labored in the St. George  Temple since January, and we have   done all we could there; and the  Lord has stirred up our minds, and   many things have been revealed to  us concerning the dead. President  Young has said to us, and it is verily  so, if the dead could they would speak  in language loud as ten thousand  thunders, calling upon the servants  of God to rise up and build Tem-  ples, magnify their calling and re-  deem their dead. This doubtless  sounds strange to those present who  believe not the faith and doctrine of  the Latter-day Saints; but when  we get to the spirit-world we will  find out that all that God has revealed  is true. We will find, too, that  everything there is reality, and that   God has a body, parts and passions,  and the erroneous ideas that exist  now with regard to him will have  passed away. I feel to say little else  to the Latter-day Saints wherever  and whenever I have the opportu-  nity of speaking to them, than to   call upon them to build these Tem-  ples now under way, to hurry them  up to completion. The dead will  be after you, they will seek after  you as they have after us in St. George.  They called upon us, knowing that   we held the keys and power to re-  deem them.    I will here say, before closing,  that two weeks before I left St.  George, the spirits of the dead gath-  ered around me, wanting to know  why we did not redeem them. Said  they, "You have had the use of  the Endowment House for a num-  ber of years, and yet nothing has  ever been done for us. We laid  the foundation of the government  you now enjoy, and we never apos-  tatized from it, but we remained  true to it and were faithful to God."  These were the signers of the De-  claration of Independence, and they  waited on me for two days and two  nights. I thought it very singular,  that notwithstanding so much work  had been done, and yet nothing  had been done for them. The  thought never entered my heart,  from the fact, I suppose, that here-  tofore our minds were reaching after  our more immediate friends and  relatives. I straightway went into  the baptismal font and called upon  brother McCallister to baptize me  for the signers of the Declaration  of Independence, and fifty other  eminent men, making one hundred  in all, including John Wesley, Col-  umbus, and others; I then baptized  him for every President of the Uni-  ted States, except three; and when  their cause is just, somebody will  do the work for them.    I have felt to rejoice exceedingly  in this work of redeeming the dead.  I do not wonder at President Young  saying he felt moved upon to call  upon the Latter-day Saints to hurry  up the building of these Temples.  He felt the importance of the work;  but now he has gone, it rests with  us to continue it, and God will bless  our labors and we will have joy  therein. This is a preparation ne-  cessary for the second advent of the  Savior; and when we shall have  built the Temples now contemplated, 
 President Wilford Wooderuff delivered  the first address at the morning meet-  ing.  He said in tracing the history of  the world we find that God has given to  the sons of men the blessing of the  priesthood.  The people of Israel had  the first priesthood as well as those  of later days.  JesusChrist, the great  high priest, chose his apostles and or-  ganized his church.  The apostles and  disciples were put to death for their  faith, until finally the priesthood came  home to God and remained there for  a length of time.    In regard to our own day, the events  prophesied are coming to pass.  "If the  revelations of the prophet had not  been fulfilled," he continued, 'you nor  I would be here.  Joseph Smith was the  prophet chosen by God to organize the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day  Saints for this dispensation, and the  spread of the Gospel has gone on ever  since.  Gold, silver and lands may pass  away, but the priesthood and salvation  never.  Individuals have come and  gone, but the priesthood remains, and  will remain with us until the coming  of theSon of Man.  I do not pretend to  say how many we have in our church  today, but we know it is flourishing  here and spreading in all parts of the  world.  Man never had a nobler calling  than going out among the people and  spreading the gospel of Christ.    JOYS OF MISSION WORK.  "There is no joy greater than to have  your sons receive the priesthood and  go out among the nations to preach  the gospel.  We have been led here to  these mountains to carry out the will  of God.  The blessings we now enjoy  are those things which were prophesied  ages ago for the latter days.    "To the young men and young wo-  men I would say they must take up  the work of their fathers and mothers  and carry on the grand mission.  To  save one soul is a great thing.  I thank  God I have lived to see these great  multitudes filling these tabernacles  and temples.  The Lord has been very  good to spare me to this day, and I   am thankful for it.  But other nations  are still in the dark.  While the priest-  hood remains with us it is our duty to  spread the gospel among all the chil-  dren of men.  Nothing should deter  us from carrying on our missions.  The  evil one has waged war against us from  the start, but the gospel of Christ has  triumphed, and to the divine help we  are indebted for the blessings we en-  joy today.  While we have the power of  the priesthood with us we should do  all that we can to correspond with the  blessings accorded us.  There is no  greater privilege than to be authorized  to go out among the sons of men and  preach the gospel.    "I feel today that we can rejoice in  the blessings we enjoy.  People are  coming here by thousands to behold  the glory of Zion.  The spirit of the  world has changed, and the hands for-  merly turned against us are now ex-  tended in welcome support.  The time  has come when Zion will go forward  triumphantly to her glorious destiny.  Wherefore I believe we should be the  best people, the most righteous and  most faithful of all the nations of the  earth."    PRIESTLY COUNCIL IN POLITICS.  The First President closed with an  important utterance, albeit it was  somewhat oracular.  He said he had  one thing that he wanted to say on the  subject of giving and taking counsel.  The apostles had heard the fear ex-  pressed that they were giving too  much counsel, and various questions  were brought up.  Especially was the  subject of politics discussed.  President  Woodruff said every man had the right  to participate in politics and exercise it.  People have a right to political as re-  ligious beliefs, and no one should in-  terfere with them, provided their re-  ligion was of the kind taught by Christ  and countenanced by those in authority  among the Latter-Day Saints.  The  apostles of the church had been  charged by the Lord with certain du-  ties, among them the giving of counsel.  There was no man or woman in the  church who should not take counsel.  Those who give counsel are held re-  sponsible for it.  If the President should  give wrong counsel, God would remove  him and put in his place one who would  give right counsel, and so with all those  in authority.  If they were unworthy  the Lord would not permit them to  occupy high places.  Hence this should  suffice, and there should be no dis-  quietude on the subject. 
 It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of—a power  which records or binds on earth, and binds in heaven. Nevertheless in all  ages of the world, whenever the Lord has given a dispensation of the   Priesthood to any man by actual revelation, or any set of men, this power  has always been given. Hence, whatsoever those men did in authority, in  the name of the Lord, and did it truly and faithfully, and kept a proper   and faithful record of the same, it became a law on earth and in heaven,   and could not be annulled, according to the decrees of the great Jehovah.   This is a faithful saying! Who can hear it?    And again, for the precedent, ##Matthew 16:18-19|Matthew xvi: 18, 19##, "And I say unto   thee, that thou art Peter: and upon this rock I will build my church; and  the gates of hell shall not prevail against it; and I will give unto thee the  keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth,  shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall  be loosed in heaven."    Now the great and grand secret of the whole matter, and the summum  bonum of the whole subject that is lying before us, consists in obtaining  the powers of the Holy Priesthood. For him to whom these keys are  given, there is no difficulty in obtaining a knowledge of facts in relation  to the salvation of the children of men, both as well for the dead as for  the living.    Herein is glory and honor, and immortality and eternal life. The ordin-  ance of baptism by water, to be immersed therein in order to answer to  the likeness of the dead, that one principle might accord with the other.   To be immersed in the water and come forth out of the water is in the  likeness of the resurrection of the dead in coming forth out of their graves;  hence this ordinance was instituted to form a relationship with the ordi-  nance of baptism for the dead, being in likeness of the dead.    Consequently the baptismal font was instituted as a simile of the grave,  and was commanded to be in a place underneath where the living are  wont to assemble, to show forth the living and the dead; and that all  things may have their likeness, and that they may accord one with   another; that which is earthly conforming to that which is heavenly, as  Paul hath declared, ##1 Corinthians 15:46-48|1 Corinthians xv: 46, 47 and 48##.    "Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural,  and afterwards that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth,  earthy; the second man is the Lord, from heaven. As is the earthy, such   are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also  that are heavenly." And as are the records on the earth in relation to  your dead, which are truly made out, so also are the records in heaven.   This, therefore, is the sealing and binding power, and, in one sense of the  word, the keys of the kingdom which consist in the key of knowledge.    And now, my dearly beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure you  that these are principles in relation to the dead, and the living, that can-  not be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation. For their sal-  vation is necessary, and essential to our slavation, as Paul says concerning  the fathers "that they without us cannot be made perfect;" neither can  we without our dead by made perfect.    And now, in relation to the baptism for the dead, I will give you  another quotation of Paul, ##1 Corinthians 15:29|1 Corinthians xv: 29##, "Else what shall they  do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all; why are  they then baptized for the dead?"    And again, in connection with this quotation, I will give you a quotation  from one of the prophets, who had his eye fixed on the restoration of the  Priesthood, the glories to be revealed in the last days, and in an especial  manner this most glorious of all subjects belonging to the everlasting  gospel, viz., the baptiism for the dead; for Malachi says, ##Malachi 4:5-6|last chapter,  verses 5th and 6th##, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet, before the  coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn the 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    we will then begin to see the neces-  sity of building others, for in pro-  portion to the dilligence of our labors  in this direction, will we comprehend  the extent of the work to be done,  and the present is only a beginning.   When the Savior comes, a thousand  years will be devoted to this work  of redemption; and Temples will  appear all over this land of Joseph,  —North and South America—and  also in Europe and elsewhere; and  all the descendants of Shem, Ham,  and Japheth who received not the  Gospel in the flesh, must be offi-  ciated for in the Temples of God,  before the Savior can present the  kingdom to the Father, saying, "It  is finished."    May God continue to bless us,  and guide and direct our labors, is  my prayer, in the name of Jesus.  Amen. 
 CONDITION OF THE GERMAN MISSION. 205    forbidden to hold meetings of any  kind. It has even been declared to  us that where seven persons assem-  ble together, that number would be   considered a metting, and if the  participants were strangers they  would be expelled, while natives  would be heavily fined. In the  Grand Duchy of Baden the same  rule holds. In the kingdom of  Wurtemberg, it has never been  forbidden that we hold meetings,  but we have as yet no official per-  mission to do so. Of course in   Switzerland we have full permission.  We can hold our meetings in any  house. It is not yet allowed us, or  in fact any one, to hold open air  meetings. The prospects of the  mission, as I look at it, are very  good, and I think the day is soon  coming when these rigorous laws  will be broken, whne all those who  desire to serve God in the way that   He has commanded, although it  may not be in accordance with the   desires of the rules, may have the  privilege. The laws of Bavaria  pretend to give full freedom of wor-  ship ; but the actual fact is, every  person is prohibited, through pres-  sure which is brought to bear upon  him, from attending anything but  the established church, which is  Catholic, or the Lutheran. People  are expected to attend or at least be  members of one of these churhces ;  and they are compelled to make an  official acknowledgement of their  belief in their work books, which  are a sort of credential, containing  the name, age, business, and place  of residence, of every workman in  the country. In this book each  man must announce his religion, and   if this happens to be anything but   Lutheran or Catholic, he is put to  great trouble and inconvenience,  would perhaps find difficulty in  obtaining work at all ; and in case  he called himself a " Mormon,"  would be punished according to   the regulations which some of the   States have made. I do not believe  that the king of Bavaria, and the   rulers of the kingdoms are as bitter  as some of the subordiante officials.  The strongest persecution we have  met with has been in the city of  Nurenburg, and that has been on  the part of the circuit judge, a man  who in other repsects is very liberal,  but who mind became prejudiced  through some false reports which  came into the country, and were  scattered by the press just as we  made a beginning. I nevertheless  hope—and I believe it is the general  feeling—that the day is not far  distant when freedom of worship  will be allowed—when the Elders  can go through the country and  proclaim the Gospel without fear or  molestation. We pray for that day,  and have great hopes that there are  many thousands in those countries  who will receive the Gospel.    The Elders are laboring ener-  getically. They have spared them-  selves no paints to discover those who  are willing to receive their testimony.  They are laboring faithfully and  with good results. The emigration  has been quite extensive, as you   know ; but the number of those  baptized exceeds by a considerable  amount the number that have  emigrated. Our branches are   therefore growing continually.    My brethren and sisters : I am  thankful to be able to testify to the  truth of this Gospel, which is being  preached in these days. I do know  that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of   God, and this is a testimony which   I have received for myself. It is  not because my parents tought me   this, or because I have heard it from  others ; that has given me courage  to bear this testimony before others. 
 heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their  fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse." [##Malachi 4:5-6##]    I might have rendered a plainer translatin to this, but it is sufficiently  plain to suit my purpose as it stands. It is sufficient to know, in this case,  that the earth will be smitten with a curse, unless there is a welding link  of some kind or other, between the fathers and the children, upon some  subject or other, and behold what is that subject? It is the baptism for   the dead. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can  they without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made per-  fect, without those who have died in the gospel also; for it is necessary in  the ushering in of the dispensation of the fullness of times; which dispen-  sation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfect  union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and  glories should take place, and be revealed from the days of Adam even to  the present time; and not only this, but those things which never have  been revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid  from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings  in this the dispensation of the fullness of times.    Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? "A voice   of gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out of  the earth; glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness for the living  and the dead; glad tidings of great joy; how beautiful upon the mountains  are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things; and they say  unto Zion, behold! thy God reigneth. As the dews of Carmel, so shall the  knowledge of God descend upon them."    And again, what do we hear? Glad tidings from Cumorah! Moroni,   an angel from heaven, declaring the fulfillment of the prophets—the book  to be revealed. A voice of the Lord in the wilderness of Fayette, Seneca  County, declaring the three witnesses to bear record of the book. The  voice of Michael on the banks of the Susquehanna, detecting the devil  when he appeared as an angel of light. The voice of Peter, James, and  John in the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna County, and  Colesville, Broome County, on the Susquehanna River, declaring them-  selves as possessing the keys of the kingdom, and the dispensation of the  fullness of times.    And again, the voice of God in the chamber of old father Whitmer, in  Fayette, Seneca County, and at sundry times, and in divers places through  all the travels and tribulations of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints. And the voice of Michael, the arch-angel; the voice of  Gabriel, and of Raphael, and of divers angels from Michael or Adam,   down to the present time, all declaring their dispensation, their rights,  their keys, their honors, their majesty and glory, and the power of their  Priesthood; giving line upon line, precept upon precept; here a little, and  there a little—giving us consolation by holding forth that which is to   come, confirming our hope. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:19-21##]    Resuming, President Woodruff said:—    Thus you have before you the subject which is resting upon us, and  which we wish to present to the Latter-day Saints. Let me say that age  has very little to do with revelation. In the early age of the world, old  father Adam, three years previous to his death—he being nearly one  thousand years of age—called together his posterity in the valley of  Adam-ondi-Ahman, and he stood upon his feet for hours, clothed with  the power of God and the revelations of Heaven, and blessed his posterity,  some seven of whom, each representing a generation, were High Priests.   Among them were Enoch and Methusaleh, both great men of their day  and generation. He prophesied upon them what should transpire with 
 206 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    But I have felt free in saying to all  men, " Repent and be baptized and  you shall receive the gift of the Holy  Ghost, and that will give you a testi-  mony as it has given it to me."  That is the testimony, my brethren  and sisters, that I feel to bear before  you this afternoon.    I am glad to be once more in these  moutains, to breathe this air, to see  those with whom I have grown up,  and to feel once more at home.  During the three years that I have  been absent, many changes have  taken place, some of them very  mournful to me ; but I am thankful  to be back once more. And now  that I am home, I hope to be able  to work steadfastly in the cause of   God, and to do my part in helping  to build up His kingdom upon the   earth. This is my desire, and I pray  that the Lord will help all of us to  remain true to the end in the name  of Jesus Christ. Amen.    President Wilford Woodruff then  address the congregation. He  said : We have been listening  to the testimony of one of our   Mormon mountain boys, who has  been called in his youth to go forth  to the nations of the earth to declare  the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the   inhabitants thereof. This is an   example of this whole Mormon  work in the day and generation in  which we live. Joseph Smith himself  was but a boy, an unlettered youth,  when God called him over half a  century ago, to listen to the voice of  the Lord, and be an instrument in  His hands to lay the foundation of  His Church and Kingdom on the  earth in the last dispensation of the   fullness of times ; and from that day  to this men have been called—some  from the plow, the plane, the ham-  mer, and from the various occupa-  tions of life—to go forth and life up  their voices and bear record to the  nations of the earth of the Gospel  of the Son of God. And the Lord  has manifested His power, and His  mercy to all who have been called to  go forth and bear record of His  name ; and Brother Cannon (John  Q.) who has addressed us, like tens  of thousands of others, can bear  record before God, angels and men,  before the heavens and the earth, to  the truths of the Gospel of Jesus  Christ, which have been revealed  unto us in the day and generation  in which we live. It is a marvelous  work and a wonder in the earth, and  it is attracting the attention of the  whole human family. The inhab-  itants of the earth marbel and won-  der, and many times desire to know  what the end of these things will be.  The lord called upon Joseph Smith,  as a literal descendant of Joseph,  who was sold into Egppt, to lay the  foundation of the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints.The  Church had been in the wilderness  for nearly 1800 years. The Church  and Kingdom of God had fallen  away. The Gentiles had followed  the same example of unbelief as did  the Jews when they departed from  the Gospel of Christ and put to  death almost every man who bore  the Holy Priesthood on the earth,  or who preached the Gospel of the   Son of God to the world. The Jews  rejected the Messiah ; they put Him  to death ;and they labored to over-  throw the Church, although it went  to them in all the power and glory,  and with all the keys, principles,  ordiances and priesthood, that  it di to the patriarchs and prophets  in former generations. For this the  Jews were overthrown. They had  to pay the bill for shedding the   blood of the Lord's anointed ; and  the Lord rent the Kingdom out of  their hands, and gave it into the   hands of the Gentiles ; and Paul 
 their posterity unto the end of time. His old age did not have any effect  whatever upon the revelations of God to him. Joseph Smith, when four-  teen years of age, while calling upon God in the wilderness, had the  heavens opened unto him. Both the Father and the Son presented them-  selves unto him in the clouds of heaven, and the Father said, "This is my  beloved Son; hear him."  The age of man is very short indeed in this day  to what it was in ancient days. Men anciently lived to a very great age.  When four or five hundred years old they took wives, begat children, and  raised up posterity. To-day our age is limited to something like three  score years and ten.    I wish to say to the Latter-day Saints that we live in a very important  generation. We are blessed with power and authority, holding the Holy   Priesthood by the commandment of God, to stand upon the earth and re-  deem both the living and the dead. If we did not do it, we should be  damned and cut off from the earth, and the God of Israel would raise up  a people who would do it. The Lord would not permit me to occupy this  position one day of my life, unless I was susceptible to the Holy Spirit and  to the revelations of God. It is too late in the day for this Church to  stand without revelation. Not only the President of the Church should  possess this gift and give it unto the people, but his counselors and the  Apostles and all men that bear the Holy Priesthood, if they magnify their  calling, should possess that gift for themselves and to assist them in their  duties, although they may not be called to give revelations to lead and  direct the Church. The spirit of revelation belongs to the Priesthood.    But to come to the subject before us.  Perhaps it may be said by the  inquiring or the objecting mind, What have you to say about redeeming  the dead, or the work of the Temples of our God, that is not already re-  vealed? I will say this: When the Prophet Joseph had this revelation  from heaven, what did he do? There are witnesses here of what he did.  He never stopped till he got the fullness of the word of God to him con-  cerning the baptism for the dead. But before doing so he went into the  Mississippi River, and so did I, as well as others, and we each baptized a  hundred for the dead, without a man to record a single act that we per-  formed. Why did we do it? Because of the feeling of joy that we had, to  think that we in the flesh could stand and redeem our dead. We did not  wait to know what the result of this would be, or what the whole of it  should be. Finally the Lord told the Prophet:  "When any of you are  baptized for your dead, let there be a recorder, and let him be eye witness  of your baptisms; let him hear with his ears, that he may testify of a  truth, saith the Lord; that in all your recordings it may be recorded in  heaven; whatsoever you bind on earth, may be bound in heaven; whatso-  ever you loose on earth, may be loosed in heaven."  [##Doctrine and Covenants 127:6-7##] That was the begin-  ning of this work.    Joseph Smith, instead of living to be nearly a thousand years of age as  Adam did, lived to be about thirty-eight years of age. He brought forth  the record of the stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim—the history of  the ancient inhabitants of this continent. By the power of God he trans-  lated that, and it has been published in many languages. Besides this, he 
 THE PREISTHOOD MECESSARY. 207    the Apostle to the Gentiles, warned  them strongly and faithfully to take  heed and be cautious lest they  should fall through the same exam-  ple of unbelief. " For if God spare  not the natural branches, take heed  lest he also spare not thee." But  all the Prophets and Apostles under-  stood by vision and revelation that  there was to be a falling away.   There has been a falling away.   I can say of a truth—whether the  world believe it or not—that from   the day the spostles and siciples  and those holding the Priesthood of   the Lord Jesus Christ were put to  death, there has not been a man on  the face of God's footstool who has  had the power to administer the  ordinances of the Gospel so as to  have power after death. I under-  stand perfectly well that world does  not believe this, nevertheless it is  true. There never was a man  breathed the breath of life in any age  of the world, who had power to go  forth and administer the ordiances  of the Gospel of Christ, ouly by the  power of that eternal and everlasting   Priesthood which Melchisedek held,  which Adam, Abraham, Moses, and  Elias, and all the ancient Patriarchs  and Prophets held. Jesus Christ  held it. He was a High Priest after  the order of Melhisedec, and  has entered into the presence of God  to plead for His brethren. The  Apostles held it. No man in any  age of the world had power to  administer the ordiances of the  Gospel without it. God himself,   who has created worlds upon worlds,  has created all these worlds and all  those that have been saved have been  redeemed by the power of that eternal  and everlasting Priesthood. But as  I said before, when the Prophest and  Apostles and all men who held the  Priesthood were put to death, the  ordiances of the Gospel became  without effect, and in consewuence  of this, the whole world has been  filled with sects and parties, with  false religions, and principles, until  it would almost appear that there are  the six hundred, three score and six,  which John the Revelator saw in his   vision. And this has been the con-  dition of the whole Christian world  from the days of Jesus Christ and  His Apostles until the Lord raised  up Joseph Smith, and commanded  him to organize this church and   Kingdom. Did he attempt to do   this until he received the Priest-  hood? He did not. He did not  attempt to administer any one of the  ordinance until he received the  Holy Priesthood from under the  hands of the holy men who were sent  unto him from God out of heaven.  The first man that ordained Joseph  Smith and Oliver Cowdery to the  Priesthood was John the Baptist,   who was beheaded from the world of  God and testimony of Jesus. Thus  they were ordained to the Aaronic  Priesthood. Joseph afterwards  received the Apostleship under the   hands of Peter, James and John,  who held the keys of the Apostleship.  God almighty could not establish  His Kingdom, His Church, His   Zion — which the Holy Bible   declares from Genesis almost to  Revelation should be established  in the latter days—without men  bearing that Priesthood. God had  to raise up such a man as Joseph  Smith, and establish His Churhc, bu   which to prepare a people for the  coming of the Son of man. To this   end Joseph was brought forth.   He received these oracles from God.  He laid the foundation of this  Church and Kingdom in his boyhood,  and he, like the Savior, and many of  God's other sevants, spent but a  short ime in the flesh after he com-  menced his ministry. The Savior. 
 organized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints upon the  foundation of apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus being the chief corner-  stone. Men were ordained to the Priesthood and sent forth, from the  various occupations of life, to carry this Gospel to the world.  God in-  formed Joseph Smith that he was called to prune the vineyard once more  for the last time before the coming of the Son of Man.  Since that, thou-  sands of Elders of Israel have been sent into the world to preach the  Gospel. Joseph Smith did all this during the fifteen years he held the  Priesthood. Let any man read the revelations in the Book of Doctrine  and Covenants, which were given through him during the little time he  spent here in the flesh. It is one of the greatest records that any man  ever gave to the human family. Not only this, but he organized the  endowments and did a great deal of other work. Who could expect him,  during the short time he lived in the flesh, to do more than he did? I  received my endowments from under his hands. He brought forth all  these ordinances that have been given unto the Latter-day Saints. In  fact, it is a marvel and a wonder that he performed as much as he did.    I want to say, as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints, that we should now go on and progress. We have not got  through revelation. We have not got through the work of God. But at  this period we want to go on and fulfill this commandment of God given  through Malachi—that the Lord should send Elijah the prophet, "and he  shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the  children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse." [##Malachi 4:5-6##]  Ye sons of men, I say unto you, in the name of Israel's God, those very  principles that God has revealed are what have stayed the judgments of  the Almighty on the earth. Were it not for these principles, you and I  would not be here to-day. We have had prophets and apostles. President  Young, who followed President Joseph Smith, led us here. He organized  these Temples and carried out the purposes of his calling and office. He  laid the foundation of this great Temple on this block, as well as others in  the mountains of Israel. What for? That we might carry out these prin-  ciples of redemption for the dead. He accomplished all that God required  at his hands. But he did not receive all the revelations that belong to  this work; neither did President Taylor, nor has Wilford Woodruff. There  will be no end to this work until it is perfected.    -[TO BE CONTINUED.]- 
 lived but three and a half years after  He entered upon His ministry.  Joseph Smith labored in the flesh  some 14 years after the organization  of the Church before he sealed his  testimony with his blood, as did  other Prophets and Patriarchs  before him. I say, from that day  until this, the Lord has called men  to go forth and declare the Gospel  of Christ. And Brother John Q.  Cannoon has testified, he knows for  himself. Yes, he knows. There  is no doubt of that. There are  tens of thousands of this people  who can bear the same testimony.  It is true there is a difference with  men with regard to the amoung of  testimony they have received to  satisfy them of the truth of this  work. Many men believe, but many  say they require a certain amount of  testimony before they know. I will  say for myself: the greatest testi-  mony I have ever received in this   Church, (and I have spent over 50  years of my life in it), has been the   testimony of the Holy Ghost, has  been the inspiration of the Almighty  God, has been the spirit of life and  salvation, that still small voice that  has rested upon me and rested upon  my brethren from the time we were  baptized into this Church until the  present day. We lay hands upon   the sick and they are healed by the  power of God. We lay hands upon   our brethren, and set them apart for   missions. The Spirit of God rests  upon us and inspires us in our words  and thoughts what we should seal  upon their heads. These words are  fulfilled, and thousands upon thous-  ands can testify of the truth  thereof.    The Bible contains a vast amoung  of prophecy concerning the last  dispensation and the fullness of  times; concerning the building up  of the Kingdom of God in the last    [column break]    days; concerning a kingdomo which  shall become an everlasting king-  dom, of whose dominion there shall  be no end. God showed this to   Daniel and to Nebuchadnezzar, as  also ti Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel.  The Prophet Isaiah has portrayed  the whole history of the Latter-day  Saints who occupy these mountains  of Israel. He described our travels  here, and our labors since we came  here. These Prophets saw our day,  and they spake as they were moved  upon by the Holy Ghost; and the  prophecies are of no private inter-  pretation. Their words are words  of truth. THeir words have had  their fulfillment and will have to the  end. The travels of this Church  have been through deep waters,  and this should not be a strange  thing to the inhabitants of the earth.  I will say here, without fear of con-  tradiction, that no man, no set of  men, no people, no ochurch, no por-  tion of the Kingdom of God can live  godly in Christ Jesus without suffer-  ing persecution. You show me a   Patriarch or Prophet that ever lived  who taught the words of life and  salvation without incurring the  hatred, the wrath and the indigna-  tion of the surrounding nations,  and you will show me something  that I have not been able to find  on the earth. But without dwelling   upon this point, allow me to say that  this is what ails the Mormons. This   is the cause of the warfare made  upon us by our nation to-day. God  Almighty has set His hand to estab-  lish His Church and Kingdom on  the earth. He has set His hand to  gather His people to the mountains  of Israel to build up a Zion. That  Zion is here. We have made a  beginning. We came here, on the  24th of July, 1847, a little handful  of pioneers. We found a barren  desert. It did not look as if any    [page break] 
 DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.    -[CONCLUDED FROM PAGE 325.]-    I WANT to lay before you what there is for us to do at this present time;  and in doing this I desire particularly the attention of President Lorenzo  Snow, of the Salt Lake Temple; President M. W. Merrill, of the Logan  Temple; President J. D. T. McAllister, of the Manti Temple; and Presi-  dent D. H. Cannon, of the St. George Temple, and those associated with  them. You have acted up to all the light and knowledge that you have  had; but you have now something more to do than what you have done.  We have not fully carried out those principles in fulfillment of the revela-  tions of God to us, in sealing the hearts of the fathers to the children and  the children to the fathers. I have not felt satisfied, neither did President  Taylor, neither has any man since the Prophet Joseph who has attended  to the ordinance of adoption in the temples of our God.  We have felt  that there was more to be revealed upon this subject than we had received.  Revelations were given to us in the St. George Temple, which President  Young presented to the Church of God. Changes were made there, and we  still have more changes to make, in order to satisfy our Heavenly Father,  satisfy our dead and ourselves. I will tell you what some of them are. I  have prayed over this matter, and my brethren have. We have felt, as  President Taylor said, that we have got to have more revelation concerning  sealing under the law of adoption. Well, what are these changes? One  of them is the principle of adoption. In the commencement of adopting  men and women in the Temple at Nauvoo, a great many persons were  adopted to different men who were not of the lineage of their fathers,  and there was a spirit manifested by some in that work that was not of  God. Men would go out and electioneer and labor with all their power 
 white men could live here. We found  a few poor miserable, degraded  Indians. They would eat a pint of  crickets for breakfast and supper,  and this, with a few roots, was all  the food they had. To-day, here is  a tabernacle. To-day, yuo can   travel one thousand miles throughout  these valleys, from north to south,  and you will find them filled with  towns, villages and cities, and yoou  will see temples, tabernacles, etc.  What does it mean? It means that  the God of Heaven is a God of truth.   He decreed certain things, and these   things are now coming to pass inspite  of all earth and hell. That is what  it means. Had it not been for this,  Utah would have been a desert to-  day as it was when we found it.    The testimony of Elders of  Israel is true. This is the Gospel  of Christ. It is the only Gospel the  Lord ever revealed to man. And   Paul the Apostle says: "Though  we or an angel from heaven preach  any other Gospel unto you than that  which we have preached unto you,   let him be accursed." The children  of men do not believe the Gospel.  They will have everything else on the  face of the earth except the Gospel.  The Lord has set His hand to fulfill   His words and promises, and we are  here to help Him in that business.  We came here to these mountains  by revelation, by inspiration. We  were led here by Prophets, Apostles  and inspired men; and this Church   and Kingdom has continued to grow  froom the day it was organized until  the present time. It will continue  to grow. The Gospel fo Christ is   the truth. "Am I therefore become  your enemy, because I tell you the  truth," said Paul to the Galatians, in   teaching them this principle. But   the truth is unpopular. The world is  full of error and falsehood. It will not  accept the plan of life and salvation.    [column break]    We are in the hands of God. God  has called us to this labor. He has  commanded us to preach the Gospel  to the nations of the earth. This   we have done so far as the doors  have been opened to us. It seems  strange to reflect upon the fact that  such nations as Germany, Austria,  and Prussia, should put up bars as  strong as iron, so to speak, against  the preaching of the Gospel of Christ  in their midst. Still the Lord, as we   have heard from Brother John Q.  Cannon, is opening up the way.  There are a great many of the house   of Israel in Germany; there are a  great many of the honest in heart  throughout the nations of the earth,  and they must hear the Gospel. We  have been preachingit for over fifty  years. The world in a great masure   has rejected it. I heard Joseph  Smith say a great deal in regard to  the attitude this generation would  assume in regard to the Gospel. He  saw the situation. Said he: "The  world will fight you. The world  will war against you. Towns will  aris and mob you, contries will  oppose you, cities will oppose you,  and the United States will combine  against you. The world is full of  darkness. Sin and wickedness is  overwhelming the world as the  waters cover the great deep. The  devil rules over the world in a great  measure. The world will war against  you; the devil will, earth will, and  hell will. But you must bear testi-  mony of me. You must preach the  Gospel, do your duty, and the Lord  will stand by you. Earth and hell   shall not prevail against you." "Fear  not them which kill the body, but   are not able to kill the soul; but  rather fear him which is able to   destroy both body and soul in hell."  And I would say to our friends, that  is the spirit that vibrates in the bosoms  of tens of thousands of Latter-day    [page break] 
 to get men adopted to them.  One instance I will name here:  A man  went around Nauvoo asking every man he could, saying, "You come and  be adopted to me, and I shall stand at the head of the kingdom, and you  will be there with me."  Now, what is the truth about this?  Those who  were adopted to that man, if they go with him, will have to go where he  is.  He was a participator in that horrible scene—the Mountain Meadow  massacre.  Men have tried to lay that to President Young.  I was with  President Young when the massacre was first reported to him.  President  Young was perfectly horrified at the recital of it, and wept over it.  He  asked:  "Was there any white man had anything to do with that?"  The  reply was, No; and by the representations then made to him he was mis-  informed concerning the whole transaction.  I will say here, and call  heaven and earth to witness, that President Young, during his whole life,  never was the author of the shedding of the blood of any of the human  family; and when the books are opened in the day of judgment these  things will be proven to heaven and earth.  Perhaps I had not ought to  enter into these things, but it came to me.  Men are in danger sometimes  in being adopted to others, until they know who they are and what they  will be.  Now, what are the feelings of Israel?  They have felt that they  wanted to be adopted to somebody.  President Young was not satisfied in  his mind with regard to the extent of this matter;  President Taylor was  not. When I went before the Lord to know who I should be adopted to  (we were then being adopted to prophets and apostles), the Spirit of God  said to me, "Have you not a father, who begot you?"  "Yes, I have."  "Then why not honor him?  Why not be adopted to him?"  "Yes," says  I, "that is right." I was adopted to my father, and should have had my  father sealed to his father, and so on back; and the duty that I want  every man who presides over a temple to see performed from this day  henceforth and forever, unless the Lord Almighty commands otherwise, is,  let every man be adopted to his father.  When a man receives the endow-  ments, adopt him to his father; not to Wilford Woodruff, nor to any other  man outside the lineage of his fathers.  That is the will of God to this  people. I want all men who preside over these temples in these mountains  of Israel to bear this in mind.  What business have I to take away the  rights of the lineage of any man?  What right has any man to do this?  No;  I say let every man be adopted to his father; and then you will do exactly  what God said when he declared He would send Elijah the prophet in  the last days.  Elijah the prophet appeared unto Joseph Smith and told  him that the day had come when this principle must be carried out.  Joseph Smith did not live long enough to enter any further upon these  things. His soul was wound up with this work before he was martyred  for the word of God and testimony of Jesus Christ.  He told us that  there must be a welding link of all dispensations and of the work of God  from one generation to another. This was upon his mind more than most  any other subject that was given to him.  In my prayers the Lord  revealed to me that it was my duty to say to all Israel to carry this prin-  ciple out, and in fulfillment of that revelation I lay it before this people.  I say to all men who are laboring in these temples, carry out this principle, 
 Saints in these mountains. We   stand upon this pedestal. This is  our platform. What fear have we  with regard to our enemies? Why   should we fear? We are in the   hands of God. We have come to  this earth in this time upon a mis-  sion. We have been born on pur-  pose in this generation to take part  in this work. The Lord required  an element to labor with. He   will build up Zion. And I bear my  testimony here to all men, and would  to all the world if I had the power,  that the work in which this people  are engaged, small and insignificant  as it may appear, is the work of God.  It will roll forth. It will become a   mountain. It will fill the whole   earth. It will break in peices all  other kingdoms, and it will stand  forever; for God Almighty has  decreed it. Write it down. Watch  the signs of the times. See if these  things are not true. We are living  in an important day. We are called  to do a work for the Lord, and we  are going to do it as far as we have  time and opportunity. It has cost  many men their lives; but men's  lives are of little consequence com-  pared with eternal life. Give me  eternal life. As for this life, what  does it amount to. Why should we  fear death? Why, bless your souls,   a few years ago this nation sacrificed  a million of lives in defense of the  country. That may be all right. I  have no fault to find. But is it any  worse to die for the Kingdom of  God than it is to die for the honor  of the country? Not much. Then  let us be faithful. Let us trust in  God. Leave all things in His  hands, and all will be right.    Now I would like to say a few   words before I close, with regard to  our present condition. Of course  our affairs have become a national  question. The eyes of all the world    [column break]    are looking towards us. But I will  say this: it is a pitiful sight--it is a   thing sorrowful to contemplate upon,   that our wise Senators, yes, our wise  Senators have to take falsehood into  the halls fo Congress to work upon  to overthrow this Church and King-  dom: so with the pulpit, so with the  press. Who tells the truth about  Utah? Not one man in a thousand  that attempts to represent this case.  We have not a boy in Utah in our  common schools, over twelve  years of age, but knows, when he  reads the statements of some of  those Senators, that they are arguing  on a false basis. They understand  that perfectly. I am at the defiance  of the world to prove that we use in  our common schools anything but the  text books of the world. We don't   even use the Bible in our common  schools. To do so would almost be  treason in the eyes of our enemies.  Yet these venerable Senators repre-  sent us as doing this. Why do   Senators argue upon false premises  to overthrow this people? If people  woudl tell the truth about us, we   should be perfectly satisfied. We  have to be satisfied anyhow.    Well, this is the state of the world  tod-say. We are called to preach the  Gospel. We preach it. There is  but one Gospel. What is it? Faith  in the Lord Jesus Christ; repent-  ance of sin; baptism for the remission  of sins; and the reception of the Holy  Ghost by laying on of hands.   These are the doctrines Jesus  taught, and that His Apostles  taught.    I feel to bear my testimony to  these things. They are true. God  is with this people. And we say to  our nation--maintain the Constitu-  tion and we are satisfied. Give us  the rights of that Constitution and  we are satisfied. It is an instrument  inspired by the power of God. Our    [page break]   
 and then we will make one step in advance of what we have had before.  Myself and counselors conversed upon this and were agreed upon it, and  afterwards we laid it before all the Apostles who were here (two were  absent—Brothers Thatcher and Lund, the latter being in England), and  the Lord revealed to every one of these men—and they would bear testi-  mony to it if they were to speak—that that was the word of the Lord to  them. I never met with anything in my life in this Church that there  was more unity upon than there was upon that principle. They all feel  right about it, and that it is our duty. That is one principle that should  be carried out from this time henceforth. "But," says one, "suppose we  come along to a man who perhaps is a murderer." Well, if he is a mur-  derer, drop him out and connect with the next man beyond him. But the  Spirit of God will be with us in this matter. We want the Latter-day  Saints from this time to trace their genealogies as far as they can, and to  be sealed to their fathers and mothers. Have children sealed to their  parents, and run this chain through as far as you can get it. When you  get to the end, let the last man be adopted to Joseph Smith, who stands  at the head of the dispensation. This is the will of the Lord to this  people, and I think when you come to reflect upon it you will find it to  be true.    Another principle connected with this subject I want to talk about. A  man has married a woman, and they have a family of children. The man  lays down in death without ever hearing the Gospel. His wife afterwards  hears the Gospel and embraces it. She comes to the temple and she wants  to be sealed to her husband, who was a good man. The feeling has been  to deny this and to say, "No, he was not in the Church, and you cannot  be sealed to your husband." Many a woman's heart has ached because of  this, and as a servant of God I have broken that chain a good while ago.  I have laid before every woman this principle and let her have her choice.  Why deprive a woman of being sealed to her husband because he never  heard the Gospel? What do any of us know with regard to him? Will  he not hear the Gospel and embrace it in the spirit world? Look at  Joseph Smith. Not one of Joseph Smith's fathers or brothers or sisters  were in the covenant when he received the keys of the kingdom of God  and translated the Book of Mormon. They afterwards received it. Every  brother and sister that he had, and his father and his father's brothers,  except Uncle Jesse Smith, embraced the Gospel. Now, suppose that any  of these had died before they had the opportunity of entering into the  covenant with the Lord through the Gospel, as his brother Alvin did;  they would have been in the same position as Alvin, concerning whom the  Lord, when Joseph saw him in the celestial kingdom, said:    All who have died without a knowledge of this Gospel, who would have  received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celes-  tial kingdom of God; also all that shall die henceforth without a knowl-  edge of it, who would have received it with all their hearts, shall be heirs  of that kingdom, for I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their  works, according to the desire of their hearts.    So it will be with your fathers. There will be very few, if any, who will 
 forefathers were inspired when they  framed it. Yet it is marvelous to   reflect upon some principles that  have been laid down--perhaps I  ought not to allude to these things,  but I am only expressing my own  reflections--even by the supreme   court of the United States. In effect  it has said that we may think as we  please, but must not act. I would   ask, in the name of the Lord, was  that all Thomas Jefferson, and others  had in their minds when they framed  the clause in reference to religious  liberty? What about men acting?  If it was only inteded that men  should think and not act, why not  say so in the instrument? Why  should it be stated that "Congress  shall make no law respecting an  establishment of religion, or prohibit-  ing the free excercise thereof," if men  were not to be allowed to act? Why,   in the excercise of their religion, men  must act: and it is straining points,  it is overstepping the bounds of the  Constitution to pass laws taking  away the rights and privileges of any  people because of their religion--  because they happen to differ from  their neighbors. Where will such a   course land our government? I will   tell you what it will do. It will rend  the government in twain like unto a  potter's vessel. It will lay the nation  in the dust. It will overhtrow the   government. When they get through  witht he Mormons there will be  somebody else to deal with. The  Constitution is good enough for any-  body. It is good enough for the  Latter-day Saints. We have no   principles but what are in accord  with the Constitution of the United  States and the laws of God. We   are perfectly willing to trust our-  selves and our interests in the hands  of God, and to leave our nation in  His hands also; for God will judge  our nation; He will judge us; He    [column break]    will judge all the children of men  and He will judge righteous judg-  ment. What men sow they will reap.   What measure they mete, it shall be   measured to them again.    I pray God to bless this nation. I   pray God to give our legislators wis-  dom, that they may maintain the Con-  stitutional principles of the govern-  ment, the only government on the   face of God's earth where the Lord  could have established His Church  and Kingdom. That we may be  prepared to inherit eternal life is my  prayer in the name of Jesus.  Amen.    President John Taylor next  addressed the congregation. He  said: It is some time since I have  taken the privilege to speak to the  Latter-day Saints in this place. I  have been visiting our settlements  in different parts of our Territory.  There I frequently talk to the peo-  ple. You have a great many here  who are capable of teaching and  instructing you, hence it is very  seldom that I intrude myself upon  you in this capacity. But I always   feel pleasure in meeting with the  Saints, in hearing my brethren  unfold the principles of eternal  truth, and in listening to the testi-  monies which they have to give con-  cerning the Gospel of the Son of   God.    God has revealed unto us the   principles of the Everlasting Gospel,  and that Gospel brings life and im-  mortality to light. Life and immor-  tality can only be made known by  the revelations of God, and people   who do not believe in revelation  cannot have any knowledge of life  and immortality. It is through that  principle alone that these things are  or have been developed. We our-  selves could have known nothing of  God from the world in which we live,  no from the teachers thereof, be-    [page break] 
 not accept the Gospel. Jesus, while His body lay in the tomb, went and  and preached to the spirits in prison, who were destroyed in the days of  Noah. After so long an imprisonment, in torment, they doubtless gladly  embraced the Gospel, and if so they will be saved in the kingdom of God.  The fathers of this people will embrace the Gospel. It is my duty to  honor my father who begot me in the flesh. It is your duty to do  the same. When you do this, the Spirit of God will be with you. And  we shall continue this work, the Lord adding light to that which we have  already received. I have had friends adopted to me. We all have, more  or less. But I have had peculiar feelings about it, especially lately. There  are men in this congregation who wish to be adopted to me. I say to  them to-day, if they can hear me, Go and be adopted to your fathers,  and save your fathers, and stand at the head of your father's house, as  Saviors upon Mount Zion, and God will bless you in this. This is what I  want to say, and what I want carried out in our temples.    The Almighty is with this people. We shall have all the revelations  that we will need, if we will do our duty and obey the commandments of  God. When any of us get so that we cannot receive these revelations the  Lord will take us out of the way and put someone in our places who can.  I am here to-day, on borrowed time, I may say. I would have been in  the spirit world to-day, mingling with the spirits in the presence of God,  had it not been for the cry of this people for my life when I lay at the  gates of death a year ago. I have been preserved by the power of God.  How long I shall live I do not know. It does not make any difference to  me. But while I do live I want to do my duty. I want the Latter-day  Saints to do their duty. Here is the Holy Priesthood in these mountains.  Their responsibility is great and mighty. The eyes of God and all the  holy prophets are watching over us. This is the great dispensation that  has been spoken of ever since the world began. We are gathered together  in these mountains of Israel by the power and commandment of God.  We are doing the work of God. This is not our home, as far as mortality  is concerned. We shall soon pass away. But while here let us fill our  mission. I want to say to Brother L. Snow, Brother M. W. Merrill, Brother  J. D. T. McAllister and Brother D. H. Cannon, and all associated with  you, carry these things before the Lord and see for yourselves. If you are  not satisfied with this order of things, go and ask the Lord about it, and  the Holy Ghost will reveal to you the truth of these principles.    This is all I ought to say at this time perhaps upon this subject. I am  glad to meet with you. I have had a great anxiety over this matter. I  have had a great desire that I might live to deliver these principles to the  Latter-day Saints, for they are true. They are one step forward in the  work of the ministry and in the work of the endowments in these temples  of our God. When you get to the last man in the lineage, as I said before,  we will adopt that man to the Prophet Joseph and then the Prophet   Joseph will take care of himself with regard to where he goes. A man  may say, "I am an Apostle, or I am a High Priest, or I am an Elder in  Israel, and if I am adopted to my father, will it take any honor from me?"  I would say not. If Joseph Smith was sealed to his father, with whom 
 cause they do not even profess to be  placed in communion with God, nor  to have revelation from Him, and   how could they speak of that they  did not know or comprehend, or that  which had not been communicated  to them? It was impossible for  them to do it. There have been  many, very many good men in the   world in the different ages when the  Gospel has not existed, that have  sought to do good to their fellow  men, and to promote their welfare  and happiness in a social, political  and religious capacity, and have  sought to introduce principles that  would be calculated to elevate and  exalt maknind in the scale of being.  That is one thing, but the inspira-  tion of the Almighty is another  thing. Let me here mention a prin-  ciple associated with these ideas that  will explain somewhat the remarks  and position of our brother, John  Q. Cannon, who has addressed us this  afternoon. He said he believed in  the principles of the Gospel, but he  did not have a testimony thereof--  did not comprehend the thing, until  he had obtained some further mani-  festation. That might be attributed  to his youth and inexperience in the  things of God; when he was brought  face to face with actualities of  life, and came in conflict with the  world he was under the necessity of  applying to His Heavenly Father,  who imparted unto him, through  the Holy Ghost, that knowledge of  which he speaks. I will mention a  principle here. Outside of the Gos-  pel, among all classes of men, among  all nations, kindreds and peoples, of  every color and clime everywhere,  they have had given unto them a  portion of the Spirit of God to profit  withal. We are told this in the   Scriptures, that God has given to  every man a portion of His Spirit;   but that is not the gift of the Holy    [column break]    Ghost. Where good men have fol-  lowed the influence of that Spirit,  it has led them to do good acts, to   be charitable, to be kind, to be   benevolent, to cultivate good morals  and correct principles, to be coverned  by the principles of honor, truth,  integrity and virtue, and these  principles prevail to a greater or less  extent among the nationsof the earth  and in this nation. This is the por-  tion of the Spirit of God, as I said  before, which was given to every man  to profit withal. Why, those people  that we talk about so much some-  times, the infidels, they have a por-  tion of this Spirit, and many of them   do many good acts. This may sound  strange, I have no doubt, to many  of you, but it is a fact nevertheless.   He that doeth righteousness any-  where is righteous, and he that  doeth evil is wicked.    Now, what is the difference be-  tween that and the other principle  Jesus said when He was upon the   earth: "It is expedient for you that   I go away: for if I go not away, the   Comforter will not come unto you;  but if I depart, I will send him unto   you." What was the Comforter to  do? "He shall teach you all things,  and bring all things to your remem-  brance, whatsoever I have said unto  you." Now, the portion of the   Spirit of God which is given to all  men does not do this thing. It does  not lead them unto all truth, for  ther eis a great diversity of opinion  among them. One may be a Metho-  dist, another a Presbyterian, one a  Quaker, another a Dunker, one a   Catholic, another a Protestant, one   a Christian, another a Mohammedan,  one a Pagan, and another an infidel,  and some one thing and some an-  other. If men were in the possession  of the gift of the Holy Ghost, it   would lead them into all truth, and  there would be one Lord, as the    [page break] 
 many of you were acquainted, what effect will that have upon his exalta-  tion and glory? None at all. Joseph Smith will hold the keys of this  dispensation to the endless ages of eternity. It is the greatest dispensa-  tion God ever gave to man, and he was ordained before the world was to  stand in the flesh and organize this work. He was martyred for the word  of God and testimony of Jesus, and when he comes in the clouds of  heaven he will wear a martyr's crown. Those of you who stand here—I  do not care whether you are Apostles or what you are—by honoring your  fathers you will not take any honor from your heads; you will hold the  keys of the salvation of your father's house, as Joseph Smith does. You  will lose nothing by honoring your fathers and redeeming your dead. It  is a glorious work. When I returned from England in 1841 and heard  Joseph Smith give this revelation, that we had power to redeem our dead,  one of the first things I thought was, "I have a mother in the spirit world."  My father was in the flesh. I baptized and ordained him and brought  him up to Zion where he is buried. But I never saw my mother to know  her. She died when I was an infant. I had power to seal my mother to  my father. Was not that a satisfaction? It was to me. I have gone to  work with the assistance of my friends and redeemed my father's and my   mother's house. When I inquired of the Lord how I could redeem my dead,  while I was in St. George, not having any of my family there, the Lord told  me to call upon the Saints in St. George and let them officiate for me in  that temple, and it should be acceptable unto Him. Brother McAllister  and the brethren and sisters there have assisted me in this work, and I  felt to bless them with every feeling of my heart. This is a revelation to  us. We can help one another in these matters, if we have not relatives  sufficient to carry this on, and it will be acceptable unto the Lord.    Brethren and sisters, lay these things to heart. Let us go on with our  records, fill them up righteously before the Lord, and carry out this prin-  ciple, and the blessings of God will attend us, and those who are redeemed  will bless us in days to come. I pray God that as a people our eyes may  be opened to see, our ears to hear, and our hearts to understand the great  and mighty work that rests upon our shoulders, and that the God of  heaven requires at our hands. Great and glorious are these principles  which God has revealed to us concerning the redemption of our dead. I  tell you when the prophets and apostles go to preach to those who are  shut up in prison, and who have not received the Gospel, thousands of  them will there embrace the Gospel. They know more in that world than  they do here. I pray God that as a people we may have power to magnify  our callings in this great and mighty dispensation while we dwell in the  flesh, that when our work is done we may be satisfied with this life and  this work. This is my prayer and the desire of my heart, in the name of  Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 Scriptures say, and one faith and one  baptism. Hence one of the old  Prophets, clothed upon by the Spirit   of the Living God, looked through  the vista of future ages and contem-  plated events that should transpire  in the latter-days, and said: "When  the Lrod shall bring again Zion,  her watchmen shall see eye to eye."  There will be no confusion there,  no difference of sentiment there.   They will palce themselves under the  guidance of the Great Eloheim, and   under His inspiration they will be  enabled to speak as they are moved  upon by the Holy Ghost; and the   Sprit of God, as it did formerly,  will take of the thigns of God and  shew them unto them. There is the  distinction between the two princi-  ples.    How can we expect that people  will comprehend the thigns of God  without the gift of the Holy Ghost?  The Elders when they are sent forth  to preach are instructed to preach  nothing but the first principles of   the Gospel--to preach nothing but  repentance to this generation. Why?  Because the people cannot compre-  hend further advanced principles.  I remember talking with an eminent  clergyman some few years ago. He  was a very gentlemanly person, well  disposed, intelligent, learned, etc.  I talked the Gospel a little to him,  but I found he coudl not compre-  hend it. Hence I commenced talk-  ing politics, history, geography, and   some little principles of science.  He understood these things perfectly,  and we had no difficulty in compre-  hending each other; but he could  not comprehend the Gospel. Was  he a minister? Yes; but he had  not the gift of the Holy Ghost, and  it was useless for me to attempt to  teach him. This is the way that  I understand these things.    Speaking of education, we have    [column break]    singular notions of education,  and some people will say--and I  have often said it myself--that  Joseph Smith was quite an unedu-  cated man. He was uneducated  when he was a boy. He was brought  up in the Green Mountains of Ver-  mont, and he did not have any of  the advantages of what we call an  education. The Lord took him into  His school, and He taught him things  that I have seen puzzle many of the  wisest scientists, profoundest think-  ers, and the most learned men that  I have met with in this world. Why?  Because he was taught of God.  What did those principles refer to?  To the earth on which we live;  to the elements of which it is com-  posed; to the heavens above us;  to the Gods that exist in the eternal  worlds; to the principles by which  the earth was organized, sustained,  upheld and governed, and its rela-  tionship to other planets and sys-  tems; and speaking of governments,  laws and principles, he possessed  more intelligence than ninety-nine  hundredths of the people of to-day.  And he sought to teach others, and  these things were introduced into   the Temple of the Lord in  Kirtland.    I have heard the Prophet Joseph   quote from the German Bible in  suppot of our method of baptism  by immersion, showing that the  German Translation of the New  Testament favored this idea, and  that the word "Taufen" in that  language means "to dip;" the same  as our term immersion does; and  that when John the Baptist was  spoken of as John the Baptist it  was "Johannes der Taufer," or  John the Dipper, which is correct.    I have heard him quote from the   Hebrew Bible in support of a plural-  ity of Gods, showing that the suffix  "mem" in the word Eloheim or God,    [page break] 
 ought to be rendered in the plural  and to read if literally translated,   "and the Gods said let us, etc."  Certain it is that in our present  translatin the word "us" or "let  us" indicates that idea; fo "us" is  certainly in the plural and means  more than one; and while our trans-  lation makes it say: "In the be-  ginning God created the heaven  and the earth," we are also told that  "In the beginning was the Word and  the Word was with God, and the  Word was God. The same was in  the beginning with God.    And the Word was made flesh and   dwelt among us," and further, that  "All things were made by him,"  visible and invisible. We are further  told that "There be that are called  Gods, whether in heaven or on earth  (as there be gods many, and lords  many). But to us there is but one  God, the Father, of whom are all   things.'    If, as stated, Jesus was with the  Father in the beginning, there cer-  tainly was more than one God--God  the Father, and God the Son.   Joseph Smith was reasoning upon  this doctrine at the time that he made  this quotation from the Hebrew  Bible.    We had a discussion in ths   Tabernacle some years ago between  Apostle Orson Pratt and Dr. New-  man--the latter a very prominent  religionist from the east--a Metho-  dist I think he was--what they call  a doctor of divinity. The subject  of discussion was--"Does the  Bible sanction polygamy?" Mr.  Newman was a well-educated man.  So was Orson Pratt. Mr. Newman  received his education in the schools  of the day--somewhere in the United   States, perhaps in the Methodist  order; but I am not sufficiently   acquainted with his history to say  anything about this; I know very    [column break]    little about Mr. Newman. But I  know where Orson Pratt got his in-  formation. And during this discus-  sion some Hebrew points were  debated, and the original Hebrew  had to be referred to. Orson Pratt  was quite as well acquainted with  Hebrew as Mr. Newman was. Where  did he get his knowledge? He re-  ceived it in the Temple at Kirtland,  Ohio. In speaking of that principle,  the principle of education, to several  leading men only yesterday, I think,  I mentioned to them, in alluding to  languages, that I was a little aston-  ished to find that an old gentleman,  about 80 years of age, whom I met  a short time ago, was thoroughly  conversant with the Hebrew lan-  guage. "Where did you learn it?"  said I. "Why," said he, "I learned  it in the Temple at Kirtland;" and  he informed me that he was now  studying Arabic. I was rather  amused at the idea of an old man  80 years of age commencing to  study Arabic. But to return. I  have seldom met with a man that  was more intelligent in the science  of astronomy than Orson Pratt.  Where did he get his information?  From the same source. He studied  mathematics all his days, and has  written works that it is very difficult  for some men to comprehend. Yet  his works are on record.    The religion of God is not a religion  of ignorance. To whom are we in-  debted for the first principles con-  tained in this book [the Bible]? To  Moses. Who was he? A man of   God. Who taught him those things?   The Lord. By what principle?   The principle of revelation; for he  could not know them without.  But had he not been taught in the  schools of Egypt? Yes. And had  he not obtained a knowledge of  astronomy in those schools, too?   Probably he had in part; but God    [page break] 
 taught him the leading, prominent  points pertaining thereto. And who  taught the Egyptians? Abraham  taught them the science of astronomy,  so we are informed, by late Egyp-  tologists, and revealed unto them the  principle concerning the motions of  the heavenly bodies. Where did  Abraham get his information from?  In reading the history pertaining to  this matter we are told that he says  of himself that he was a follower  of righteousness; that he sought   after more righteousness; that he  examined the history of his fathers  and traced back his genealogy to the  commencement of the world, and  from before the commencement.  Afterwards we are told in the same  history that the Lord gave unto him  a Urim and Thummim by which  he was able to comprehend many  things that others did not under-  stand, and by which he obtained a  knowledge of the heavenly bodies  and of their motions. Moses was  one of the first to illustrate this  principle; but Abraham, who was  before Moses, as also Joseph, under-  stood it more clearly than Moses.  And in those things wherein the  world to-day are puzzled in regard  to the Scriptures, and the six days  that are there spoken of, Abraham  speaks of thsoe das as times, epochs,  or ages, different and distinct from  the days spoken of by Moses, and  his record agrees precisely with many  geological facts that have puzzled so  many of this generation. Where  did he obtain his knowledge?  From God. Who controls the  heavens and the earth? The Gods  in the eternal worlds. Who has  implanted certain principles in  matter and in all creation? God  has done it. All things are subject  to these laws; and if men can place  themselves under His guidance and  find the way to approach the great    [column break]    Eloheim, they will know more in a   very short time than all this world  together know in all their lives and  more than all the combined intelli-  gence of the world, for God is the  foundation of all wisdom, and the   source of all intelligence and knowl-  edge. We are told that Solomon  was a wise man. Where did he get  his wisdom? From God. He prayed  to the Lord to give him wisdom and  the Lord told him that because he  had sought wisdom he should have  it, and He would also add unto him  the rich treasures of the earth.    I speak of these things for the   information of the Latter-day Saints,  and to disabuse your minds in regard  to some of those principles that men  sometimes talk about. The world  possesses a certain amount of knowl-  edge and intelligence, and it has  progressed very rapidly of late years.   We have had many discoveries in  the arts and sciences and in the  researches pertaining to geology,  chemistry, etc., but many of their  ideas and deductions are perfectly  foolish and rediculous. We have  had the introduction of railroads,  gas, steamboats, manifestations of  the power and use of electricity, etc.  Nevertheless, these principles al-  ways existed; it needed a develop-  ment of them only to bring them  into practical use; and there are  thousands of other things not yet  made known, yet to be developed,  similar to those that have been dis-  covered. In regard to these things,  some of them are important, some  of them are not very important.  The intelligence that the world  boasts so much of, is not very pro-  found when you come to test it by  the principles of eternal truth.    In regard to the action of the  Congress of the United Statess, which  has been referred to, I want to  say to you Saints, you need not trou-    [page break] 
 ble yourselves about it--you need  not be the least concerned about any  of these affairs. But they are acting  unlawfully. That is the worse for   them. When the Government  begins to break down the safeguards  of society, tear in pieces the Con-  stitution of the United States, and  trample under foot the liberties of  man, they are only preparing the  nation for an utter overthrow.   There are plenty of elements of dis-  cord and disintegration all around.  Congress should not be the first to   exhibit examples of lawlessness and  the violation of Constitutional rights.  However, if they can stand it we can.   We need not trouble our heads about   any of these matters; there is an   overruling Providence that controls  the affairs of men and nations. So  you can rest perfectly easy, you  Latter day Saints. We shall con-  tinue to do right. We will continue  to sustain good principle. And what  will you do? Just what Jesus said.   We will do good for evil. What else?  We will pray for them that despite-  fully use us and evilly treat us.   Why? That we may be the chil-  dren of our Heavenly Father, and   act on the same principle that He  does towards the human family.  Does He act in that way? Yes.   For he maketh His sun to rise on  the evil and onthe good, and sendeth  His rain on the just and on the un-  just. He has introduced certain   laws into the system of His govern-  ment that regulates all things per-  taining to these matters. He does  not make those little divisions that  the United States are trying to make  to-day. He is more philanthropic.  He treats all alike, and places all on  the same basis. Then, we will try  and operate with Him and for Him,  and in the interests of humanity,  and in the protection of human  rights, and we will try by every legal    [column break]    and constitutional method to main-  tain and sustain the principles of  human rights in behalf of ourselves,  in behalf of our children, and in  behalf of thousands and tens of  thousands of honorable men that  live in these United States. We  can very well afford to abide by the  Constitution of the United States,   and to sustain it, and we can afford  to believe in the Bible and to obey  its ordinances, and practice them,  which they cannot do, and do not do.  As I have said, we can afford to treat  all men well, and to pray for those  which despitefully use us and per-  secute us. Those who are trying to  despoil us are objects more of sym-  pathy in my feelings than anything  else. I feel sorry when I see mis-  rule abound anywhere, let it be in  this nation or other nations. God  would like to see peace, union and  harmony. For that reason He has  introduced the Gospel, and the prin-  ciples of intelligence associated with  it. Man is a dual being, he possesses  a body and a spirit, and is connected  with time and will exist in eternity,  and it is for him to understand the  nature of his organism, and his  relation to the world in which he  lives, and to God our Heavenly  Father. What, then, will we do?  Why, we will try and live for one  another; we will try and be honest,  honorable and virtuous, no matter  what people can say about us.  Concerning the lying about us, we  need not trouble our heads. I do  not think we are much better than  Jesus was. The people in His day  said He was possessed of devils, and   worse than that, that He cast out  devils by the power of Beelzebub,  the prince of devils, and they killed  Him saying He was an impostor and  a deceiver, and because He said He  was the Son of God, when they   knew He was not. And His theology    [page break] 
 was altogether at fault with the   learned Rabbis of that day, as ours  is with the learned Rabbis of this.  We cannot help that. What we  know, as Brother John Q. Cannon  has said, we know for ourselves.  We not ask any odds of man. I  don't. I know that God lives; I  know that He has revealed the  truth; I know this is the everlastinig  Gospel. I know that you Saints, if  you are faithful, will secure to your-  selves an inheritance in the celestial  kingdom of God; but if you are not  true to God and your religion you  will not. If you go after the things  of the world and depart from the  principles of righteousness and  trample upon the principles of honor,  virtue, truth, or integrity, you will   not enter that kingdom. It is not  every one that saith, Lord, Lord,   that shall enter the kingdom of   heaven. What shall we do then?  We will fear and love God and work  righteousness, and send the Gospel  to the nations of the earth, despite  the follies, the wickedness and cor-  ruption of men; and we will pro-    [column break]    claim the truth in these valleys and   mountains, and Zion will spread,  grow and increase. God will be for  Israel, and we will sing, Hallelujah!  the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth,   and He will reign until He has put  all enemies under His feet. Let  this people fear God and work right-  eousness, and I ask no odds of earth  or hell. God is at the helm. He   will manage things according to the  counsels of His will. He will say  to this nation and to other nations,  as He did to the proud waves of the  ocean, "Hitherto shall thou come,  but no further; and here shall thy  proud waves be stayed." Our safety  and our defense is in the Lord of  Hosts. Let us put our trust in Him  and obey His laws, and He will bless   and sustain us in time and through-  out the eternities that are to come;   and we will try and benefit this na-  tion all that we can, and all that they  will let us, and if they will not let   us, we cannot help it.    God bless you and lead you in the  paths of life. Amen. 
 Prest Cannon has read this    Fruita.  Grand Junction Valley  Colorado.  Dec 2nd 1897    Prest. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Beloved President.    In company with Elder ^H. S.^ Ensign and ^F. C.^ Graham  I came to this city 16 days ago. We have held a series  of meetings for 13 days, generally in the evening, in  Fruita and vacinity, to crowded houses, and for the last three  nights, have been holding a disscussion with Dr S. P.  Green a noted Infidel and gentleman of culture, a  graduate of colledge, who pressed me so strongly by  letter that I felt I could hardly refuse to accept his  challenge, as it would appear to our many friends that  we were affraid to have our principles investigated. I  accordingly felt that the best things to do was to was to accept   the gentlemans challenge. I accordingly did so. The Dr  is very widely known in this valley as a man of good 
 education and ability—the news ^of the debate^ soon spread of  like wild fire  a large town hall was secured and the anticipated discussion  was known became christened the "Mormon Infidel  Discussion." standing room was at a premium, for isf  ever you saw a people stirred, as I know you have  many times you can imagine how the people felt here  conducted themselves here—for 10 miles around they came to  our meeting: The subject of dis under discussion was:  Resolved: that Mormonism was and is founded upon "Myth-history  Superstition and Credulity"—the Dr took the affirmation and I  the negative.    I felt much depended upon the result of the debate and made  it a matter of earnest prayer ^in connection with the brethern,^ and asked our Heavenly father  to give us success—for we had a great desire to make an opening ^here^    The hour arrived to open the discussion, the Dr who has  a splendid Library and is a well had fortified himself with  a supply of Anti Mormon literature, opened the discussion by  attacking the character of Joseph Smith and rideculed the  idea of angels appearing to men, and brought up the Spaulding  story—the Danites, spiritual wife doctrin: the and tried to prove   that the prophet was put to death upon this ground by enraged  husbands, who was seeking vengance on the defiler of their  homes—he brought up affidavids by the dozen—among  some of which was th contained in the "American Encyclopedia"  among many other things, an affidavit from purporting to be   sworn to by Orson Hyde and Thomas B. Marsh 
 he tried to ^bring testimony that would^ Invalidate the Testimony of the "Three  Witnesses and the Eight Witnesses and he brought up  more infernal lies to support his side of the question than I  supposed was in existance, he closed his remarks invokeing the  Thunderbolts of Heaven to strike every man who followed in the  example taught by Joseph Smith and burn them to ashes &c &c  (the same was repeated by the Dr every night, with no new  arguments:)    I arouse ^arose^ to my feet asked the faith and prayer's of the people,  and proceeded carefully to dispel the flood of lies, fortunately  I had with me the "Myth of Manuscript Found" by Geo Reynolds  "The Manuscript Found," Edward Stevenson's pamphlet" and  others books, as the peo[p] arguments of the Dr began to  dissapear one by one the people began to see the truth and  they were truly astonished to hear the proofs we had to  support our position. I read Josephes account of his vision  the Three Witnesses individual testimony &c, &c, and wound  up by bearing Testimony to the Devine Mission of the  Prophet and the brethern sang We thank thee O, God for a  Prophet—the next night was spent in simelar arguments    The last night the Dr attack me very savagely upon  Polygamy, and when I bringing up the most Damnible hearsays   that mortal man ever listened to; and called upon me in the  name of God to know if I had the termerity to palliate or  advocate, this damnable doctrin of Devils in this advanced    —over— 
 day of advanced civilization &c.    The people There was a breathless silence as I arose to  my feet and the people was doubtful as to my ability to sustain   the Doctrin of Polygamy for up to this time I had avoided the  question, purposely as I had an hour's time the last night  and did not wish to go into the subject until I could  do it Justice for so I was prompted by the spirit of the  Lord—Oor our Heavenly Father put his spirit upon me  like a fire, for the young brethern was behind me praying  unto God to give us success and truly our prayers were  answered: for as soon as I arose to my feet I felt  prompted to engage in a little humor until I got the  people to roaring, then when I saw their feelings mellowed  I felt prompted to say: There is a great drouth of prescise  information regarding the views of the Latter Day Saints regarding  the question of Polygamy and I deem it my duty to take up the  question and treat upon it inasmuch as I had been attact by  the Dr my opponent: I announced, we beleived the principal of  Polyamy to be a correct one under proper regulations but was   not at present advocateing its practice &c I told them no man  could be a christian and not beleive in Polygamy—That no  man could go into the Kingdom of God who did not beleive  in Polyamy—That Jesus was from a Polygamous  stock that if they beleived in Christ they must accept  the doctrin of Polygamy or reject them both. 
 I have been blessed of the Lord many times but never  at any time did the Power of God rest upon me to  a greater extent I showed up the fulfillment of the  promise of the Lord to our Father Abraham and I traced  up his lineage down to Christ showing the redeemer to  have fulfilled that great promise. I finally got  Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ^and their desendants^ in the City of the New  Jerusalem and the whoremongers, seducers, dogs, and  liars and Dr Green on the outside: our cause was  gained—God gave us a great victory—Hail to  the Prophet was sung by the power of God by  the young brethern—The people thronged around  us, with compliments, God speed you, come and see  us, and hand shakeing with the people was the  only way to get out of the house—Truly man is  nothing without the spirit of God.    Eight people have applied for baptism, and many   friends are investigateing—we sold all the books we  had—which was two dozen Voice Warning, and gave them  all a tract, and we hope all will be overruled for good, and  we The E feel that our Father has heard our prayers   for when we first came into the valley we knelt downard  dedicated our selves unto him and prayed earnestly  for success—and we feel like lifting up our 
 6    voices in praise and thanksgiveing to God for his care  over us    About sixteen ^applications for^ baptisms are reported from the   several fields—6 in Fort Collins—8 in Colorado  Springs—and two in Pueblo—also the 8 here—    The missionaries are all well, and everything seemes  in a prosperous condition.    This is a very fruitful valley—we wont need   to bring settlers in here to colonize East of here as we  will, with the blessings of the Lord have more people  here than will be needed in a few months    I leave in company with Elders Ensign and Graham  for Walsenberg to night where we will hold meetings  for 12 days. Elder H. A. White and David Mann  will remain here and hold the Fort.    Asking a kind remembrance to all the brethern  and praying God to bless you abundantly with  his Holy Spirit. I remain, asking an interest in  your prayers. I remain  With Kind love    John W. Taylor    [sideways text  John W Taylor  Dec. 2nd 987[end of sideways text]

 MY BELOVED BROTHER    I lay my hands up^on^ thy head in the name of Jesus Christ the Son  of the living God and seal a blessing on thy head which shall  reach thy posterity—a seal that shall not be taken from thee.  I bless thee as as Melchizedeck blessed Abraham when he returned  from the slaughter of the ten kings. [##Genesis 14##]    I confer on thee all the blessings of Abraham Isaac  and Jacob which includes all the blessings both temporal and  spiritual—the blessings of heaven and the blessings of earth.

Parrish's and on the  25th of the same month we commenced boarding with  Elder Jonathan H. Hale    Sunday the 28th I repared to the House  of the Lord to worship with the congregation of the  Saints. The spirit of murmering and rebellion  of which I have already spoken in a former page  had not slept but had been brewing in the family  circle in the secret chamber and in the street until  many and some in high places had risen up  against Joseph who^m^ God raised up to lead Israel  and they were striving to overthrow his influence and  cast him down. This grieved the spirit of the  Prophet to find such perils among false brethren 
 But notwithstanding this thick cloud of darkness impending  over Kirtland Joseph being unmoved in the cause entered the  congregation of the Saints and arose and spoke to the people in  the name of the Lord in his own defence. The Lord was with  him by his power and spirit to the convincing of the honest  that he would stand and his enemies fall. Sidney followed  with an able discourse and several others maintained Joseph  in his integrity. But alas one arose once a friend but now in  his darkness he stretched out his puny arm and proclaimed against  the Lord's An^n^ointed but Joseph acted wisely while all saw the  spirit of his foe.    I spent the evening of the 30th in preparing  myself to go forth on a mission to the eastern country to  again proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ in company with  several of the brethren.    Having reached to this period of my history I  will close Chapter IX and commence a new one with my  mission to Canada and the Islands of the sea.    [FIGURE]    CHAPTER X.    [six lines blank]    May 31st arrived; and the time had come for  me to take the hands of the Saints in Kirtland in parting from  them to go into the vin^e^yard to proclaim the word of God. I  accordingly took my farewell of Mrs Woodruff my companion  and sister Hale who were expecting to tarry together for a   season. I then left Kirtland in good spirits in company  of Elder Hale and having walked to Fairport a distance of 
 twelve miles I took the steamboat Sandusky with Elders  J. H. Hale and Milton Holmes at 12 o'clock at night    We reached Buffalo at 6 o'clock on the morning  of June 1st. We then went on board the Indiana and  sa^i^led to Syracuse which we reached on the third    The next day which was Sunday we  walked from Syracuse to Richland Oswego Co. N. Y.  where I was again blessed with the privilege of taking  by the hand my brethren after the flesh—namely,  Azmon and Thompson Woodruff. I had not seen  either of them for three years. I found my cousin  Elad ^Eldad^ Woodruff with them.    There was something of a coldness  manifested by my family relatives towards myself  and the two brethren in the Church who accompanied  me. This was because of our religion and This coldness  was especially shown by Elizabeth my brother's wife    Notwithstanding that it was against  the principles of my brother's family to receive us for  the night we were permitted to sup with them and  one of my former neighbours Mr Walter Menter gave  us a place to lay our heads for the night which we  gladly accepted.    I called in the morning at my brother  Azmon's and conversed with him and also my brother  Thompson upon temporal and spiritual subjects. Neither  of them manifested any hardness towards me in the  morning but both appeared affected. Brother Azmon  said he was still seeking for light and truth and should  not have left the Church of Latter-day Saints had it not  been for his trials and temptations &c.    Having commended them to God I took the  parting hand of my brethren and their household feeling  perhaps that it might be the last time that I should see  them in the flesh. I left with some painful sensations  and a firm belief that there would be some change in their  household which presentiment I expressed to my brother  Azmon. In my heart I prayed the Lord's mercy upon  my brethren—kinsmen after the flesh but I ^could^ not say  as I left the threshold of his house the peace and 
 1854-1858 
 blessing of God I leave with you which I ^as I could^ have done had we  been received in the name of the Lord. We then walked to  sister Calvins and Elder ^Duchers^ in Jefferson's county being a distance  of 24 miles during the day.    On the morrow we travelled to sacketts Harborur  ^&^ visited the American Garrison which was beautiful for situation  We also had an interview with brother Archibal Patten. At  10 o'clock at night we took passage on board the Oneida at  Sacketts Harbour and crossed Lake Ontario to Kingston in the  province of Uper Canada    I was now in the dominions of Great Britain  and this was the first time that I ever trod the soil of the  British Soverign. After spending several hours in Kingston we  walked to Kingston Mills on the morning of the 7th; and spent  the night there.    We took the steamboat June the 8th at 8 o'clock  a.m. at Kingston Mills to go up the canal. We passed through a  swamp of about twelve miles in length which abounded with  ^fir & such as muskrat otter beaver &c.^    From Brewer's Mills we passed through Crambary  Marsh to Jones' Falls where the boat passed through four locks  which were built by the British Government and supposed to  be the most splendid works of the kind in America. They  cost four hundred thousand dollars being one hundred thousand  each. Yet notwithstanding these magnificient works the  face of the country presented a scene of the most gloomy  aspect; it being a rocky hilly barren uncultivated country    We left the boat at the locks and walked to  brother A^rtemus^ Judd's in the township of Bastard Leeds  County Upper Canada where we were joyfully received  by the Saints of God. They had been brought into the  Church through the instrumentality of Elders J. E. Page and J.  Blacksley and we were much rejoiced to hear of the work of  God prospering in their hands.    The 9th was spent in writing and on the  following day we attended Conference with Elders John E Page  and James Blakesley at the township of Bastard.    The Conference consisted of 13 Elders 5 Priests  8 Teachers and 6 Deacons besides a large congregation  of Saints. 
 I was called upon to open the meeting by prayer. The  conference then proceeded to business.    There were eight Branches of the Church represented  consisting of 300 members in all. Thirty two brethren were  presented for ordination and Elder William Draper and myself  were called upon to ordain them. We then ordained   7 Elders 9 Priests 11 Teachers and 5 Deacons. This with  some other matters filled up the business of the day.  Meeting then closed and I accompanied several brethren to  Elder Stodard's where we spent the day ^night^.    The conference was continued on the next  day and I was called upon to address the congregation  in the morning service. It was with peculiar feelings  that I arose to address a large body of Saints in the  capacity of Conference raised up in another nation seperate  from my own and under another Government. This  was the first time that I had ever addressed a congregation  of Saints under the British rule. I preached  from the ##2Corinthians 4:3-4|2nd Cor. IV, ch 3rd & 4th## verses.    The Spirit of the Lord was with us and  we were blessed. After I closed the Saints spake in  tongues and prophesied. Five presented themselves for  baptism which was administered unto them by Elder  Page thus was added others to our number.    After an intermission Elder Page addressed  us upon the Priesthood and bore a strong testimony to  the people. Our Conference then closed by our returning  thanks to God.    We took the parting hand of many brethren  and sisters and I returned with several Elders to brother  Stodard's to spend the night.    At his house there was a woman presented  who was often possessed with the devil. She was oft times  dumb and greatly afflicted by evil spirits that dwelt in her.  She beleived in Jesus Christ of Nazareth and in us as his servants  and called upon us to cast the devil out of her.    According to this woman's request four of  us laid our hands upon her and commanded the devil  in the name of Jesus Christ to depart out of her and  it was immediately done. The woman arose with great 
 joy and gave thanks and praise unto God; for according to her  faith she was made whole from that hour. A child also that was sick  was made whole by the laying on of hands in the name of Jesus  according to the words of the Lord. See ##Mark 16:17|Mark 16 ch, 17th verse##.    On the 12th I parted from Elders Page and Blakesley and  many other Saints and traveled in company of six other brethen to  the Branch of the Church in Leeds.    We met together in the evening at brother Carnes' to  present ourselves before the Lord and b^e^are testimony of his work. Elders  John Go^o^dson H Hale M. Holmes and John Snider followed each  other in testimony and I testified next. The Spirit of God rested  upon us all.    I called upon sister Carnes to present before the Lord two  of her children who were sick, that we might administer unto them  One was a sucking child and lay at the point of death. I took it in  my arms and presented it before the Elders who laid their hands upon  it while in my arms and we healed it in the name of Jesus Christ  I then returned it whole to its mother. The other child was  also healed; and the parents praised God for his goodness. I  spent the night at brother Eetons.    On the following day I jorneourneyed to Kingston  Upper Canada with several of the Elders and on the next went on  board the Great Britian. We reached Oswego at 7 pm. The  Great Britian was at this time the largest steam ship in the  world and the boast of the English people. We continued our  journey in the line boat Maumee. At Syracuse we went  on board the Saint Joseph and on the 16th we reached Utica  and thence started in a rail car to Schenectady. Here we  parted from Elder John Go^o^dson and Priests Isaac Russel and  John Snider. These brethren who had journeyed with us from  Canada were bound for the city of New York to join two of the  Twelve who were to start for England on the 20th of June 1837  to carry glad tidings of salvation to the inhabitants of Europe. The  two of the Twelve refered to is Heber C. Kimble and Orson Hyde  They were first chosen to open the kingdom of God in England  and five others of the brethren were to accompany them    We continued our journey five miles after parting  from the brethren; and the next day travelled 33 miles more;  and on the one following reached Canaan Litchfield Co. Connecticut  I was delighted once more to set foot upon the soil of my native 
 State and to strike hands with one of the Elders of Israel raised  up in this district—namely, Elder Gibson Smith who was presiding  over the Canaan Branch. He received us kindly and bade  us welcome. A meeting was appointed and I preached to the  people in the Academy who listened with most silent attention  This day we had walked 33 miles.    On the morrow we walked to Mr Jesse Moses  where we found Priest Julian Moses and a number of  brethren and sisters and we rejoiced together. I spent the  night at brother Francis K Benedict's and was informed that  my father Aphek Woodruff had moved from Colebrook to  Farmington his former place of residence.    I walked in company of brother Benedict jun  on the 22nd to Beach Hill in Colebrook Lichfeld Co. Connecticut  Here I had the happy privilege of again embracing my  sister Eunice Woodruff. It was five years since we  last parted from each other. I found my sister teaching  school in the Rock School house.    After the interview of our first meeting  and dinner with my sister was over Eunice and I visited  the Stillman neighbourhood in order to find Elder Dexter   Stillman from thence together we walked to Mr Daniel  Norton's in New Marlborough Berkshire Co Mass and thence  to father Benedict's. The whole distance of the day  was forty miles.    The 23 was spent in writing and on the  next day, Saturday, we met in Conference at Mr Jesse Moses in  Canaan. The conference was composed of 5 Elders and two  more were ordained during the day. On the Sunday  the Conference was continued when we had much liberty in  speaking to the people. After meeting Elders Milton Holmes  and J. Moses started on a mission to the town of Mansfied.    On the 28 I again visited Rock School  house in Colebrook with Elder Hale. Here I found my  sister Eunice still employed teaching school. After a  short interview with Mr Alpha Sage I spend the remainder  of the day with Eunice whom I accompanied to her  school and spent a very interesting time. As the scene  and reflections of the time affected me much as well as 
 interesting me with the associations of home and family recolections  I will here give from my journal a discription written at the time of    My Sister Eunice  Teaching School.    I entered the school taught by my Sister Eunice at 1 o'clock  a^p^.m. Five hours I spent within its walls watching my sister  in the performance of her school duties and in perusing letters written  to her by my brother Asahel. Five years before when I last  beheld Eunice at our father's house she was only a child of twelve  years of age; but in the scene before me I now beheld her an  instructoress of youth. As I looked up^on^ her—my only sister  teaching the youth and showing accomplishments that grace the female  sex varied reflections passed through my mind and emotion of strong  affection moved me. There she appeared before me (only seventeen  years of age) adorned with youth modesty and loveliness    With a degree of admiration I gazed upon her and marked the  change five years had brought upon her ^produced^. Her spirit was ^blythe^ blithful  and her step as she moved among her pupils showed the energy  of youth    As if to call my mind more perfectly to the  recollections of home and past scenes Eunice with a cheerful grace  presented me with the bundle of letters from our brother Asahel  They were fifteen in number and addressed to my sister. As  I read them through they filled my soul with emotion and brought  as great a variety of feelings as the matter they contained. They  showed the cultivated mind and refined talents of a brother writing  to a sister with the purest spirit and deepest feeling for her  welfare. Such teachings as those to Eunice if followed by  the female youth would lead them by a thousand snares. The  name of Wilford was mentioned often. As I read I smiled and  wept & in my heart said O God protect my brothers my sister  my wife and my parents.    I left the School with my sister and together  we viewed the Colebrook landscapes as we walked along and conversed 
 of our brother Asahel and of home and childhood's days.  Together we visited our parents' dwelling at Sage Mills but  they had gone to Farmington. Stumps and stones and house  and all looked natural. I went into the house but no  parent or brother was there but all was as silent as death  ^I dropped a tear^ and Eunice plucked a rose as we left    From thence we went to Jonathan Stillmans  where we took supper after which Eunice and I parted  for the time and in company of brothers Hale and Dexter   Stillman I preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the school  house in the evening and bore testimony unto the truth  of the Book of Mormon.    The next day I preached in a Methodist  meeting house and on the following one had an interview  with a Methodist priest who said that God had neither  body parts nor passions and that it was rediculous to  worship one who had. I continued preaching &c during  the three succeeding days but nothing occurred that would  be interesting here.    On Indipendence day July 4th I rode to  Colebrook post office and to visit sister Eunice. At the post  office directed to my father and sister I found two papers  from brother Asahel but no letters. Eunice had joined  a party to sail on the ^Doolittles^ pond. On my return  home I saw them cross the pond in the boat. I raised a  flag in token of friendship and they answered but did not know  me and as they passed my sight behind a grove I bowed  to them in silence and said to myself God save my sister    With brother Hale I took stage to New  Hartford and from thence went to Avon and spent the night at  aunt Helen Wheelers and visited my friends and kinsmen in  the place.    The Place of My Nativity    The six^th^ of July was a day of great interest to  me. After visiting Daniel, Luther, and many in Avon I left  Aunt Wheelers and walked with Elder Hale on the canal to  uncle ^Adna^ H^art^s from thence to Woodford Mills built  and formerly owned by my father Aphek Woodruff. Here I was 
 born and here I spent my youth.    After viewing the Mills I went to the house where  I was born and visited each appartment. The house and farm all  looked natural ^Bogue Hill^ not excepted. I called at Mr Henry Woodruff's^ford^  and saw Mrs Woodford. I also called upon Mr Judds Mrs Allens ^Z^  and O Harts. At Roger Woodfords I saw Eldad W. and Lavilla Day.  I visited uncle Titus Woodruff's family and saw Caltha Herd at their  house. I called upon Capt Francis Woodruff Erastus Woodruff and Adna  and C. [&c] ^Woodruff^ who were all glad to see me. I also visited uncle  Ozem Woodruff's family. He was absent. I also saw many other friends.  During the walk I passed the school house in which I spent many of  my youthful days. I gazed upon it and upon the graveyard where  slept many of my progenators and friends. There was reposing also  the remains of my mother. I read the inscription on their toombstones  of several numbered with the dead who were well when I left  Connecticut in 1832. On the toombstone of my mother was  the following inscription:    A pleasing form a generous gentle heart  A good companion just without art  Just in her dealings faithful to her friends  Beloved through life lamented in the end.    My mother Bulah Thompson Woodruff was born in 1782  and died June the 11th 1808 aged 26 years. She was married  to my father Nov 29 1801 and by him had three children—  namely, Azmon born Nov 29th 1802; Ozem Thompson born Dec  22nd 1804; and Wilford born March 1st 1807    My father afterwards married Azubah Hart by whom  he had six children five sons and one daughter, my sister Eunice.    After spending most of the day in visiting the before  mentioned friends I walked from Ozem Woodruff's to Farmington  to again visit my parents who had moved from Colebrook a few  days previous to their former place of residence.    I arrived at my father's house at the setting of  the sun, where I was once more blessed with the happy privilege  of taking again my parents by the hand and of beholding them  face to face after being seperated from them over five years    I was joyfully received and made heartily welcome  I visited the Mills where I had spent several years and passed the night 
 The next day was spent at my father's in writing to  brother Asahel and on the following day I walked to Avon and  visited uncle Thadeus Thompson, Grandmother Thompson and  her household and many other relatives and neighbours all of  whom manifested pleasure in seeing me. The night was spent  at uncle Titus Woodruffs.    Sunday the 9th I went to uncle Ozem Woodruff and  found him at home. It was with much pleasure that I  met this dear old friend who hast oft led me by the hand  in youth and taught me the gifts and graces of the Church  I also visited other relatives and friends and at night preached  at the school house to a congregation of them. They gave  great attention and treated me with kindness and the Spirit  of God rested upon us    On the morrow Elder Hale and myself went to  Collensville w[h]ere uncle Ozem was assisting in building a  stone dam across the river. There I visited a grove where  I had often retired in 1830 for prayer and meditation. I  had here many interesting seasons by day and by night while  tending the mill for Collens in 1830. In this pine grove  I spent three hours in reading the Book of Mormon and  in prayer    At six o'clock p.m. I met at the city hall at  Collensville for the purpose of preaching the Gospel to the  people. Immediately after I arose and commenced speaking  drums were heard at the door and laughing and sneering were  provoked in the congregation. The Presbyterian priest was  enraged against the truth and as soon as I closed he hurried himself  to the place where I stood and I was immediately surrounded by  the congregation. The priest said I had no right to enjoy my  opinion and he became angry and said many very inconsistant  things. The priest and people with very few exceptions rejected our  testimony. Afterwards brother Hale uncle Ozem and myself repaired  to the grove for prayer where we had a good time    The next evening I preached at Lovely Street School  house upon the authenticity of the Book of Mormon and the people  gave good attention. I spent the night at uncle Ozem's and we  conversed upon the things of the kingdom until the following day  At 2 o'clock on the morning of the 12th uncle Ozem and his family 
 January 1854    January the 1st 1854 came on a Sunday. I attended at the Tabernacle  The people were addressed in an interesting discourse by Orson Hyde. In the afternoon  by Elder Wilford Woodruff who was followed by President Brigham Young    Next day the new year was celebrated by the usual  social manner. I delivered an address to the inhabitants of the Fourteenth  Ward in the forepart of the day and was followed by several others    In the evening I attended a party at the Social Hall. The  time was mostly spent in music and dancing. We had however an  interesting address from President Brigham Young on    Dancing and Music    "I consider this a suitable place to give some instruction. We have  assembled here to have music and dancing. The world have had very strange  ideas concerning these things. They have supposed it was very wicked  for a Christian to dance or hear music. Many preachers of the day  have said that fidling and music came from hell; but I say there is  no fiddleing inor music in hell. There is not a fiddler in hell  nor any music of any kind. Music belongs to heaven to  cheer God angels and men. If we could hear the music there  is in heaven it would overwhelm mortal man    The Lord gave us that organ that makes  music so delightful to man and the Devil has stolen music and  many other things that was ordained of God for the benefit of man  and he has turned it to an evil use; but music and dancing  is for the benefit of the holy ones and if those who come here to  night are not holy and righteous and do not feel to worship and  praise God they have no business here    What strange ideas the world have of a Prophet  They would expect to see a man with finger nails a foot long  with his hair hanging to his hips his body covered with dirt and  filth his head bowed down ^in sorrow^ for the sins of the world and that 
 household beleived in the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel and at the  same hour I led them forth and pbaptized them for the remission  of their sins. There were three of them namely, my uncle and his  wife Hannah and their son John. This was a fulfilment of a vision  given to me in 1818.    After baptizing them I walked in company of Elder  Hale to Simsbury to visit aunt Cossetts household and was glad to  behold them face to face and to teach them the things of the kingdom  And On the next day I parted from her and other relatives visited others  in Avon and rode to Farmington to my father's where I found a letter  from my wife Phebe in which she gave me the information that she  was on her way to Farmington.    On the Sunday following I had the happy privilege of  meeting my wife. She came to attend our meeting at Adna Harts in  Avon. My stepmother and Eunice accompanied her. At 5 p.m. I  preached to a congregation of relatives neighbours and former friends and  then returned to my father's at Farmington    I bid adieu to my father and mother on the 20th  and also my sister Eunice. I then took stage with my wife and  rode with her to Hartford a distance of ten miles. She continued  her journey to her father's in Maine by stage while I persued  it on foot. The reason why I did not go farther with her  by stage will be easily understood by those who are acquainted  with the history of the first Elders of the Church who like the  Apostles of old travelled and preached without purse or script  I had only sufficient money to pay my wife's fare and thus it was  that she continued her journey from Hartford per stage while  I did it on foot.    During the next three days I walked 136 miles. On   the first I walked 52  and on the second 48 leaving 36 for the third day which I accomplished  by about 5 o'clock in the afternoon.    Here I will briefly relate an incident of my second day's  travel. Within a mile or two of [blank] I felt so weary and worn  out that ever^y^ step was made with painful effort. Just then a  gentleman came dashing along swiftly in his carriage. As he  was passing I prayed that he might be moved upon to take me up  The horse shot by me with swiftness to the distance of ^10 rods^  and then stop^p^ed and seemingly of his own accord as suddenly as though 
 he would not have a house or lie in one nor in a bed but in the caves   of the rocks and on the ground and must never smile or appear happy.   And as to seeing an Apostle the people would expect to melt if one came   along. But all of these ideas are vain and foolish; for this company before   me to night does not begin to be adorned inside or out as they should be   in order to meet with the angels ofin heaven who are adorned in purity   power and glory clothed with clean white linen    I will say a word concerning dancing with the   Gentiles. As I have got up this party if I had felt disposed   to have invited some Gentiles here would they have contaminated   me or this company? No; because the Priesthood rules here   with the keys of power truth light and knowledge; and I would not   suffer anything that is wrong for I would control things and have them   my own way or break up the party. But if any Elder in this   Church was to follow after Gentile parties they would submit   themselves to their spirit partake of their evils and go to the   devil. Any Elder would fall who pursued this course    Why do not the Gentile merchants of this   City embrace this work? Because they have locked bolted and   bar[r]ed their minds against it with every lock they could put on. They   swore by every power they possess before they left home that they   would not embrace it. They came with but one object and that was   to gain money and they are determined not to be turned from   their purpose."    Many other excellent remarks were made by   President Young.    Sunday the 22nd I preached in the morning  from the text, Whatsoever ye sow that shall ye also reap. [##Doctrine and Covenants 6:33##] In the   afternoon President Young preached and I reported his sermon    At the close of the meeting I went in company   with President Young to see President Willard Richards who was very   sick with the palsy. He was in a dreatful spasm lying   upon the floor with seven men trying to hold him.

 some barrier was in his path while the gentleman impelled by  the same power turned to me and sung out to ask if I would ride  Of course I answered in the affirmative    On the third day I arrived at New Rowley, Essex Co., Mass.,  where I was joyfully received by the parents of Elders Jonathan and Milton   Holmes. Here I found their son Milton brother Hale and my wife  Phebe whom I was rejoiced to again meet.    Nine days later, August 1st I left the friends in New Rowley  and journied with Elder Hale towards my father-in-law's in the state  of Main which I reached on the 8th.    Soon after my arrival at bro E Milliken Elder Milton  Holmes also arrived bringing my wife with him. After dinner I  rode with Phebe to her father's, Mr. Ezra Carter. This was the first  time I ever saw any of my wife's family. It had been about one  year since Phebe left her father's house to go to Kirtland    When we arrived at the house we found Phebe's father  absent and her mother confined to a bed of sickness: she had been  very low but was fast recovering. One of my wife's brothers was  at home and all her sisters. Two of her brothers were absent.   It was an affecting meeting and we were both joyfully received and  made welcome. During the evening father Carter came home &   we all rejoiced exceedingly    In company with Ezra and F^abyan^ Carter I went  out in a fishing boat on the 11th. We spent the day and night  at anchor and caught 250 fish such as cod haddock hake &c  I also saw four whales. Two of them appeared in view at the same   time. This was the first time I ever saw a whale    On the 18th I took the parting hand of my friends  in Scarborough and leaving my wife at her father's I started with  Elder Hale to visit the Islands of the sea to preach the Gospel to those  who trade in ships. We arrived at Portland in the evening where ^I^ saw  my brother-in-law Ezra Carter. The population of the place was about   16,000. The next day we took steam boat for the Islands called  Fox Islands where after changing boats once we arrived at 2 o'clock in  the morning.    Having landed we called at Nathaniel Dyers and retired  to rest. When we arose we made ourselves known as servants of God and  enquired concerning religious meetings in the place. It was the Sabbath  day and we learned that there was to be preaching in the Baptist meeting   house in the centre of the North Island which was part of Vinal Haven. 
 he suffered immensely and it seemed as though he was struggling in the agonies   of death. He had been sick several days. I spent the night with him   He suffered much during the night. The Presidency and Twelve administered   to him by the laying on of hands. We were almost fearful that he   would not recover from this sickness still we hoped.    I returned home in the morning, and Dr Richards   continued failing during the week    On the Sunday I attended with Dr Richards in   the forepart of the day. He suffered much. At the close of the   afternoon's meeting the Presidency and Twelve went to Dr Richards and   administered to him by the laying on iof hands and we had done it frequently   and had sometimes hopes of his recovery but all outward appearences had   been against he'is getting up again.    After the evening's Ward meeting I went to Dr   Richard's and spent two hours with him. He was very low and to   all appearence would not live until the morning, but the next   morning he was alive and appeared somewhat better.    Next day also Dr Richards still lived and continued   better and there were many reasons to desire his recovery and to expect   it principally because the Twelve had administered to him many times   and exercized their power and faith in his behalf    I attended the Bishops meeting in the evening   with Elder Thomas Kington. I addressed the Bishops and had   the Spirit of the Lord. We were now beginning to ordain our   young sons to the lesser Priesthood here in Zion    We were gathering all our young children from   eight years old and upward in the several Wards, one evening in each   ^week^ Ward  for the purpose of speaking and praying. I met with the children   in the Fourteenth Ward this evening and addressed them. I had   some fifty of them speak and it was an interesting time.    I will here record a matter that gave me great   pleasure. On the 2nd of February I united with the Bishop of the   14th Ward and his Council in ordaining 1 Priest 2 Teachers and 2 Deacons 
 Mr Benjamin Kent accompanied us to the meeting place.    When we arrived the meeting had commenced. We conversed  with the Deacon of the Church and informed him that we were servants of God  He communicated the fact to the baptist priest by the name of Gideon J Newton  and also delivered to him our statement that we were servants of God Lord sent  with a message from him to the people and that we wished to be heard. Mr  Newton did not object and we were invited to the stand by him and he gave  out an appointment for us to preach at 5 o'clock p.m.    When he had closed his meeting he invited us home with  him and gave us some refreshments and we presented him with the Book of  Mormon. He was mild and said he would read it    In the evening Mr Newton accompanied us to the meeting  house where the congregation assembled at the appointed time. With peculiar  feelings I arose and addressed them from ##Galatians 1:9|Galations 1st ch and 9th verse##  This was the first time that I or any Elder of the Church to my knowledge  ever arose before the inhabitants of one of the Islands of the sea to preach to  them the fu^l^lness of the Everlasting Gospel and the Book of Mormon.    After I closed I gave out an appointment for each of  the four following evenings to be held in the several districts of North  Island. We spent the night with Mr Benjamin Kent.    As I am here fairly at the beginning of my mission to  the Islands of the sea there properly seems to open at this part of my history a  new chapter.    CHAPTER XI.

 Universal Scientific Association    Organized February the 2nd 1855    I attended the organization of this society on the evening of the  2nd. The following persons were appointed the board of the  Universal Scientific Association    Wilford Woodruff President; John Taylor  Orson Spencer Ezra T. Benson Albert Carrington Lorenzo  Snow and Samuel Richard's Vice Presidents    George A. Smith Wm. W. Phelps corresponding  Secretaries.    Robert Campbell Clerk and George D. Watt assistant  Clerk and reporter.    The object of this society was to promote every good  science establish a Museum and Library and lay a foundation for  useful knowledge    Sunday the 4th we had some of the strongest  preaching ever delivered in Great Salt Lake City. Orson Pratt  preached in the morning upon the subject of Zion in the last  days and the Kingdom of God to be built upon the mountains  of Israel. He was filled with the Spirit of God    In the afternoon D. H Wells spoke of his faith  and first acquaintance with Joseph Smith. Then Jedediah  M. Grant arose and large guns were fired with red hot balls  and the Gentiles were told of their wickedness corruptions and  abominations and strongly warned against attempting any farther  to traduce and corrupt the wives and daughters of the Latter-day  Saints and the Saints were strongly warned ^against^ associating with  the Gentiles in an unholy manner    President Kimball followed and said, he 
 and the Priest which I ordained was my son Wilford Woodruff Jr.. He   was 13 years of age and he was now beginning to officiate in the   Priest's office of the lesser Priesthood. I thanked the Lord that I had   lived to see this day when I had a son who received the Priesthood.   I prayed the blessings of the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob tro   rest upon him that he might honour his calling all the days of his   life and do much good in bringing many souls into the Kingdom of   God and always maintain the Kingdom of God with all its laws   and principles    Next morning Feb 3rd my son Wilford was about   to commence to officiate in his office as Priest by going through the   Ward to visit the house of each member in company with brother ^D. J.^  Ross in the capacity of Teachers in the Ward. So I called my family   together for the purpose of prayer and dedicated my son unto the   Lord. His father and mother laid hands upon him and   blessed him and dedicated ^him^ unto the Lord. The following is the   blessing bestowed upon his head    Blessing Of Wilford Woodruff Jnrr    (Born in Montrose Iowa March 22nd 1840)    His Blessing was given, under the hands of his father Wilford  Woodruff Sen, one of the Twelve Apostles, in the City of the   Great Salt Lake Feb 3rd 1854 when young Wilford was thirteen  years and 323 days old. His mother assisted in the Blessing.    "Wilford: In the name of Jesus Christ and by virtue   of the Holy Priesthood I lay my hands upon your head and seal upon   your head a father's blessing and seal upon you the Priesthood of   Aaron which you have received and also to dedicate you unto God for   the purpose of the ministry 
 Haven fits out above one hundred licensed sail besides small craft  North Fox Island is nine miles long and two miles wide with a population  800. They have a post Office one store a baptist church a meeting  house four school houses and a grist mill. The land is rather  rocky and rough yet there are good farms which produce fair crops  of wheat barley oats potatoes and grass and this form the staple  production. The principal timber is fir spruce hemlock and  birch. Sheep are the chief stock upon the Island and raspbury  and goosebu^e^ries in abundance    South Fox Island comes as near being without  any form or void as any land I ever saw. It would be  difficult for an historian to give an exact description of the  Island. It is about ten miles long and five wide and it is  one universal mass of rocks formed into shelves hills and dales cut  up into necks and points to make room for the coves and harbours  that run through and through the Island. The population  of the place is one thousand. They get their wealth principally  by fishing and their principal stock is sheep. Some parts  of the Islands are under cultivation but it is at the expence  of much labour and toil. Many of the inhabitants of  this Island fish at Newfoundland and bring their fish home  and dry them upon their own flakes and prepare them for  the market which they supply anually with great quan^ti^ties  of dried fish mackerel and boxed herre^i^n^g^. There is two  stores three tide saw mills two stores six school houses and  a small branch of the Methodist church and a priest. The  timber is pine fir spruce hemlock and birch and much of the  timber and whoretlebury bushes grow out of the cracks of the rocks  Raspba^e^ryries and goosebu^e^rries also grow in great quanti^ti^es upon  this Island.    The fish which give the trade and life of these Islands  are found in great abundance in the waters coves and harbours  arround. Theyre are Whale Blackfish Shark Ground Shark pPilot-  fish Stors Mackerel Sturgeon Salmon Holloboat Cod Pollock Tom-cod  Hake Haddock Shad Herrein^g^ Whiting Dolphin Skate Flounders and  many more too numerous to name besides all kinds of shellfish    On the Monday August the 21st being the second day  of our sajourn in Vinal Haven we visited the sea shore and saw  twenty gallant ships under sail. It was a fine day. We went to 
 would withdraw fellowship from any sister who would run after the  Gentiles and from any mother who would give her consent to her daughters  doing so or from the father ^who^ would give it. If he caught any man  committing adultry with one of his daughters he would kill them both  but he said let no one kill another for committing adultry who had been  guilty of the crime himself.    The Indian Chief Walker Dead    We met at the President's House for Prayers. Report came  that Walker the Indian Chief was dead. He died in his  tent with consumption. This drew out some remarks upon the  subject from President Young. He said that he was thankful  we had got along as well with the Indians since we had  been here. He thought they had improved in their condition  considering their limited advantages as much as the Saints had  done in comparison.    There was quite an exitement on the Monday  amongover the Gentiles over the preaching in the Tabernacle  on the Sunday.    The Eastern mail came in and brought me  from my brother Thompson Woodruff 31 different kinds of apple  grafts, the choicest fruit he had    Appointment of a New Governor    This mail brought news of the appointment of a new  Governor. It iswas said that Col. Steptoe was our  Governor which afterwards proved to be true and the Colonel  refused to accept the appointment    There was a great deal of excitement in the  City upon the subject of the appointment of a new Governor 
 I seal upon your head all the blessings of Abraham Isaac and Jacob. I   seal you up unto eternal life, and no power shall take your crown; and you   shall live long upon the earth and do great good and bring many souls into   the Kingdom of God and you shall stand in defence of Zion and if you will   be faithfull in keeping the commandments of God you shall receive the   fulness of the Priesthood and the Apostleship and the keys thereof and shall   follow the footsteps of thy father wherein he has been faithful in the   Apostleship; and thou shalt live and not die. Thy body shall not be   laid in the grave but thou shalt live till the coming of Christ. Then   shall thy body be changed in the twinkling of an eye from mortality to   immortality and shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the air when   he shall come in the clouds of heaven to meet with the Saints on the   earth.    Thou shalt be a great man on the earth. Thou shalt   have posterity and thy sons shall bear the Priesthood after thee    Thou shalt be a comfort and a consolation to thy   father and thy mother in their declining years. Thou shalt cause the   heart of thy mother to rejoice who has laboured hard to preserve thy   life from infancy up to this day    Thou shalt have power to teach the great things   of the Kingdom of God and do great miracles. Thou shalt heal   the sick and cast out devils in the name of Jesus Christ. Thou   shalt see visions and dream dreams and angels shall administer unto   thee and teach thee great things. Thou shalt see Zion established   in Great Power and Glory    I seal all these blessings upon you in   the name of Jesus Christ: Amen    This blessing was sealed upon the head of my son   Wilford and recorded under my hands on the third day of February   A.D. 1854.    I spent the most of this day in school with my   children. During the evening Sisters Whitney and Eliza Snow 
 the North district and preached in the school-house. Elder Hale preached upon  the authenticity of the Book of Mormon and I followed him. We spent the  night with Mr Stephen Luce.    The next day we again visited the sea shore and gathered some  pebbles from the beach which we intended to preserve in memory of the  Island. We also went out with Mr Luce in a boat to catch fish in  Penobscot Bay. On entering the mouth of the bay we found it covered  with a sholal of Pohagen fish extending over acres of sea. It was  supposed that there were in the shoal enough fish to fill five hundred  thousand barrels. We caught none of them but saw and heard them  rush in large bodies upon the top of the water. Afterwards we walked  to the school house where I preached to a large congregation among  whom was Priest Newton.    The day following I visited Eleazar Carvers on the  east part of the Island. I stood on his farm and took a view  of fifty-five Islands of the sea: a part of them were inhabited and  some were not. There were also twenty ships under sail taken into  my view of the scene. At night ^In the evening^ we preached in the east school  house and spent the night at Mr Luce's    The day after we preached at the west school house  to a large congregation and stayed with Deacon Hezekiah Eames  and on the following one Elder Hale preached in the east school  house and I in the west. This day in visiting Benjamin   Crabtree Esq I found in his library an account of John Calvin  burning Servetus a French physician for differing from him in  religious views.    Next day I preached in the North school house and  on the following one, Sunday, I preached at East Parish on faith  in the morning and in the evening to a large congregation  in the Baptist meeting house on the coming of Christ. I gave  out five appointments for the week. I was informed that the Rev  Mr Newton had not a soul besides himself to attend his meeting    Thus, without entering into the detail of every day,  it must be understood that our mis^s^ion was pushed forward with  the same labour and spirit in our ministry and on the 23rd ^3rd of September^ after  delivering two discourses I opened a door for baptism when two  candidates offered themselves for the ordinance. They were Capt.  Justus Eames and his wife. We immediately walked to the  sea shore and Elder Hale baptized them. They were the first 
 It was also reported theat Secretary Harris was to be sent back  to us as our Secretary. The paper mail was left out at Laramie  The Indians did not disturb them on the way but many were  gathering east of Laramie. The papers reported a war in the  Nebraska Territory between the Missourians and Settlers    On the 10th I attended the meeting of the  Universal Scientific Association. The Constitution  was again read and the Committee reported that all the  officers chosen had received their appointments. Speeches  were made by several members and by the President and  Vice Presidents    On the 15th the Society again met at the  Historian's Office. We spent several hours together in laying  plans for the instruction and edification of the people. The  Board wished me to deliver an opening address.    I spent part of the next day at the  Historian's Office examining my Journal containing  Joseph's sermons preparatory for publication in the  Church History.    Our Views Concerning the Government    It had been given out a week previous that President Young  would preach to the people on Sunday February the 18th upon  our views concerning the Government of the United States  and all the strangers were invited to attend. aAt an early hour  the Tabernacle was full and a thousand people who could not get  into the house. A large congregation out of doors who could  not get into the Tabernacle was called together by Elder Orson  Pratt and he preached to them.    A good many strangers were gathered together 
 called upon us and spent the evening. We talked over the days of Kirtland   and other times. I read over several of the old sermons of Joseph not   recorded anywhere only in my Journal. We spent a pleasant evening.   Before they left Sister Whitney sung in tongues in the pure language   which Adam and Eve made use of in the garden of Eden. This gift   was obtained while in Kirtland through the promise of Joseph. He   told her if she would rise upon her feet (while in a meeting) she should   have the pure language. She did so and immediately commenced   singing in tongues. It was as near heavenly music as anything   I ever heard    On the 6th I attended meeting with the   Perpetual Emigration Fund Company which adjourned till the first   Monday in March.    I took out of the Library the first Vol. of th[e]  Live [Life] of Benjamin Franklin read it through during the day was   highly interested and instructed by its perusal and extracted into   my Daily Journal from his rules of perfection which he endeavoured   to carry out in his life    Views of The Resurrection    Sunday the 19th E. D. Woolley was called upon to preach upon   the resurrection as some of the Saints had advanced some eronious   ideas. When he closed President Young followed and made   many good remarks among which he said:    We should have our same identical bodies which   our Spirits occupied in this life; our graves would literally be opened   and our bodies come forth. The question was asked if children   who died in their infancy lost anything. He said, "No; a person   would not lose anything which they had not got. Children who   died in infancy would be provided for in some way.    He also said, our God was Father Adam   He was the Father of the Saviour Jesus ^Christ^. Our God was 
 he ever administered the ordinance of baptism to and the first fruits  of the Church upon the Islands of the sea. I gave out an appointment  for the next Sabbath and administered in the confirmation of brother  and sister Eames.    The next day we visited brother Eames and houshold  and found them rejoyicing in the Lord. While there a young man  came in to enquire what he should do to be saved. I taught  him as Peter did on the day of Pentecost. [##Acts 2:14-40##] The Spirit of   was like leaven in the Island    We then took a boat and crossed to South Fox  Island. We had a pleasent sail of about a mile and half and   we sung on our way "In a gallant sphip we ride," &c. I rejoyiced  to stand upon another Island of the sea to preach the Gospel  We immediately gave out an appointment at School house No 1.   Elder Hale preached and I followled    The next day we went to the top of a high ledge and  stoped on a smooth granite rock covering two acres. Some of the   face of it was covered with a light soil out of which grew the pine  the whoretlebury and wintergreen. We sat down under the shade of   a pine for morning prayers. Brother Hale read the ##Jeremiah 16|XVI ch. of   Jeremiah## which speaks of the hunters and fishers which God would  send in the last days to gather Israel. Of a truth here we were  on an Island of the sea standing upon a rock where we could [survey]  the ships and the places arround as full of rocks holes and caves  as any part of the earth and were here to search out the  blood of Ephraim and gather him from these Islands rocks holes   and caves.    I sat in company with Elder Hale and while the  sun was shedding his beams to gladden the earth the spirit of God  caused our souls to rejoice.    We read and sung and rejoiced in the Lord; we  spake of the ancient Prophets and Apostles in Jerusalem in Asia  and also of Nephi Alma Mormon Moroni and others in America  We also spake of Joseph Oliver Sidney and of the Twelve and the  Seventies. Nor did we forget brothers Kimball and Hide and  the others on their mission to England and the Elders on their missions  in general. While filled with these meditations and the promises  of God we fell upon our knees and prayed unto the Lord for all  Israel and especially for Joseph. 
 in the Tabernacle. After singing, and prayer by Wilford Woodruff  President Young arose and said that as he did not expect to be able to  speak to the people he had prepared an address to be read before the  assembly and when that is read, he said, I will say a few words.  Thomas Bullock then read the address before the congregation    President Young in his written address sustained  the Constitution of the United States also its laws but he used a  sharp two edged swoard against wickedness and wicked men in high  places and when it was finished ^he followed^ with a lengthy cutting oral address  which was sharper and more pointed than his written one. This  speach was fully reported and may be found in the Deseret News of that  date and also in the Journal of Discourses    Ordination of the Son of Hyrum Smith  To the Office of  First Patriarch of the Church  Feb 18, 1856^5^    After the meetings at the Tabernacle on the day President Young  delivered his speech on the Government of the United States I had  the satisfaction of seeing John Smith the eldest son of our martyred  Patriarch Hyrum Smith set in the middle of our prayer circle  and Presidents Young Kimball and Grant and Orson Pratt Wilford  Woodruff George A Smith and Lorenzo Snow of the  Twelve Apostles laid hands upon his head and ordained  him unto the office of the first Patriarch in the Church and  Kingdom of God. This blessing was sealed upon him  as it belonged to him by right through the linage of his fathers  It was recorded in the Historian's Office taken from a report of  Thomas Bullock    At the close of this meeting I returned home and took 
 no more nor less than Adam, Michael the Archangel    On the 1st of March I was 47 years of age.    The California mail came in on the 3rd bringing news among which was that   Santa Anna was proclaimed Emperor of Mexico.    On the 10th I met in council with President Kimball and   the Twelve. I ordained three Elders. We had a good council and Elder   Kimball spoke powerfully for the space of three hours and warned the Elders   who were going out on mission against sin in all its forms and to keep   the commandments of God    Death of   President Willard Richards  Who died March the 11th 1854    After President Willard Richards was reduced to deaths door; by the   laying on of hands and the prayer of faith he was raised up so   that he walked about his room and appeared as though he was going   to get well; but he was taken by a relapse and had been failing   for several days. This morning he appeared worse and the Twelve   were sent for to come and administer to him; but before we could   get there he was dead. He drop[p]ed away almost without a groan   Thus closed the life of brother Willard Richards on the morning   of the 11th of March 1854 at about 30 minutes past 9 o'clock.    President Willard Richards was born at Hopkintown   Middlesex County Massachusetts June 24th 1804 and from early youth   was the subject of religious impressions though car[e]less and indifferent in   his external deportment. At the age of 10 he removed with his fathers   family into Richmond in the same State where he witnessed several   sectarian revivals and at the age of seventeen had passed the ordeal   of conviction and conversion. He sought admission into the Church   which being disregarded led him to a stricter investigation of religion 
 Sunday the 10th we met a large congregation at brother Justus  Eames. After meeting I opened a door for baptism when another sea  Captain the brother of Captain Eames offered himself for the ordinance  as did also a young lady. I rejoiced greatly to find the captains of  the sea enter the New and Everlasting Covenant and as I stood upon  the shore after baptising these new members of the Church I addressed  the people under the Spirit of God and they were cut to the heart.    Things moved along with us in our ministry daily much  according the first part of our mission to the Islands of the sea excepting  that the Rev Mr Newton and also the Methodist priest turned against  and opposed us.    I preached baptized visited the other Island of the  sea and on Sunday October 1st we organized a small Branch  twelve in number and for the first time administered the  sacrament to the Saints here.    On the next day we started to return to our  friends in Scarborough and capt Valentine Eames offered to convey  us to Thomaston in his sloop. He also promised to obey the  Gospel on our return, which promise he kept.    We reached my wife's father's on the sixth and I  remained in this part with the Saints preaching &c until the 28th  when I started to return to the Islands. In the interval  brother Hale had left for Kirtland and this time my wife  Phebe accompanied me    After our journey and a stormy passage on  the way I again was on the Islands of the sea with my wife  where I found the Saints rejoicing in God and strong in the  faith. We were welcomed by them with much joy and warmth  of affection.    It was on the second of November when I returned  and continued my mission as before and an the 15th I went on  board the Susan Eliza with Capt Coombs to sail to the Isle of Holt.  There was much snow on board the vessel. We had a fair wind  but a rough sea and pleasent over head.    We arrived at the Isle of Holt at 12 o'clock  and I preached at early candle light in the school house. I spent  the night with John Turner esq and sold him the Book of  Mormon. This is the third Island of the sea that I have  visited to preach the Gospel. 
 most of my family to the Ward meeting. The house was full  to overflowing. I went into the stand with the Bishop  The Spirit of God was upon me. I felt full of ^the spirit of God^ the Spirit of God  and fire that had eminated from President Young that day  and I spoke to the people with power and sharp reproof of  sin and against becoming corrupted by the Gentiles    On the 1st of March I was 48 years of age.  I found time rapidly hurrying me through life.    Brothe Joseph Russell died on the morning  of the 10 of March 20 minutes past two o'clock. He was  about 70 years of age, was from Merimichi. He had been  a faithful Latter-day Saint and was a High Priest. He had  given nearly all his means to the Church amounting in all  to about seventy thousand dollars. I attended his funeral next day.    In the afternoon of the 22nd I attended  the Mayor's Court. The military officers had entered  complaint against some boys for running horses by them  and insulting them in the streets. The suit was  dismissed on account of their being no law against running  horses and the officers had the costs to pay    I went to Toille on the 31st a distance  of 40 miles from Great Salt Lake City. I spent the  night with Brother Maugh^n^ and attended a conference  of Elders in the evening    April the 1st was Sunday and  Ezra T. Benson and myself met with the Elders and Saints  who had assembled in Toille Valley from the different  settlements around for a General Meeting. I preached  to them in the forenoon. We had a great shower  of rain during the afternoon and evening yet Ezra T  Benson preached to them in the afternoon and we  had a good meeting notwithstanding the rain. 
 and he became convinced that God had no Church on earth and from   that time he kept aloof from sectarian influence.    In the Summer of 1835 while in the practice of   medecine near Boston the Book of Mormon which President Brigham Young   had left with his cousin Lucius Parker at Southborough providentially   fell in his way. He opened the book without regard to place and   totally ignorant of its design or contents and before reading half a   page said, "God or the devil ^has^ had a hand in that book, for   man never wrote." He read it twice through in about ten days   and became so convinced of the work of God that he resolved to close   his business and go to Kirtland to the Saints a distance of seven   hundred miles; but he was directly smitten with the pas^l^y [palsy] from   which he suffered greatly and which prevented the execution of his   design until October 1836 when he arrived in Kirtland in company   with his brother (Doctor Levi Richards who attended him as a   physician) where he was warmly received by his cousin Brigham   Young with whom he tarried and gave the work a thorough   investigation.    On the 31st of December 1836 at the setting of   the sun Doctor Willard Richards was baptized at Kirtland under   the hands of President Brigham Young in the presence of Heber C.   Kimball and others who had spent the afternoon in cutting the   ice to prepare for the baptism.    He was chosen by revelation through   the Prophet Joseph in July 1838 to be ordained one of the Twelve Apostles   and was ordained accordingly at Preston England, while on a mission   to that country under the hands of the Twelve in their first council   as a quorum among the nations at which were present Brigham Young   Heber C. Kimball Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt Wilford Woodruff   John Taylor and George A Smith.    He was with the Prophet Joseph and Hyrum   the Patriarch at the time of their martyrdom in Charthage prison when   John Taylor was also wounded with several balls. He alone of 
 I will not enter into a minute detail of the remainder  of the next two months which closed the year 1837. Sufice  it to say that I sailed from place to place arround to  preach the Gospel and my wife Phebe sometimes accompanied  me. The closing passage of my Journal for the year  will show how the work progressed during that time. I  wrote under date of Dec. 31st as follows:    "The Spirit of God is like leaven in the midst  "of these Islands of the Sea; the solemnities of eternity is  "resting upon the people; the word of God is like a sharp  "two edged sword in their hearts [##Hebrews 4:12##] and I am preaching and  "baptising almost daily."    SYNOPSIS FOR 1837    IN KIRTLAND.    I attended the Solemn Assembly and met twenty  times with the Seventies.    ON MISSIONS:    I travelled in Upper Canada and in six  of the United States and visited and preached the Gospel  in three Islands of the sea, making 2,350 miles, mostly  performed on foot.    CHURCHES BUILT UP:    I planted three Churches and held 108 meetings  after leaving Kirtland May 31st for my mission.    BAPTISMS, CONFIRMATIONS, &c.

 1855    General Conference  of  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints  held  In the Tabernacle ^Bowery^ Great Salt Lake City  April the 6, 1855.    The Conference conveined at 10 o'clock in the morning.  Presidents Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball and Jedediah  M. Grant were in the Stand of the First Presidency. Of the  Twelve Apostles Orson Hyde Orson Pratt Wilford Woodruff  George A Smith E. T. Benson Charles C Rich and Lorenzo  Snow    The Tabernacle could not hold the people so they  met in the Bowery. There were 12000 people supposed to be  present. The whole proceedings of this General Conference  are published in the 5th No of Vol V of the Deseret News; but  I will give a synopsis of the Conference here.    [blank space] 
 the Twelve was all whom Joseph wished to tarry with him at Nauvoo when he   sent the whole of the quorum besides on mission and in that dreadful day of martyrdom   the Lord preserved him scatheless and in the absence of the rest of the Twelve   the direction of the affairs of the Church in Hancock County fell upon him   in that dreadful hour and in the midst of the mob at Carthage with   the mangled bodies of the martyrs and the care of Elder John Taylor his letters   and counsells held in check and tempered the grief and wrath of the community   of his brethren in Nauvoo    In the Spring of 1847 he was enrolled in the   memorable Band of Pioneers under President Young and in the Spring   of 1848 he was unanimously elected by the voice of the Church as   Second Councillor in the Presidency of the Church.    He was secretary in the State Government of Deseret   and President of the Council of the Legislative Assembly after our   Territorial Organization, besides being Postmaster for Great Salt Lake   City up till his death and a member of the Perpetual Emigrating   Fund Company.    He was also the Editor and Proprietor of the Deseret   News from its origin and General Historian of the whole Church and   Church Recorder    I have travelled with brother Willard Richards both   in England and America many miles and we have been warm   associates many times. He was a great Counsellor in the   Church and I as well as the body of the Saints have received much   excellent Counsel from him. He was the first man who had   a natural death in the Church from the First Presidency or the   Twelve Apostles. All who had died of them before had been   martyred.    On the day after the death of President Richards   in company with his brother Levi Richards and George A. Smith   I called upon President Brigham Young at his room for   he was not able to get out. We conversed with him   conscerning the burial of Brother Willard and he advised us to 
 MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS    I attended two Conferences; procured twenty three subscribers  for the Elders' Journal; sold eight Books of Mormon; there was^were^  five cases of healing under my hands; I blessed two children,  wrote thirty letters received thirteen and recorded two of the  Prophet Joseph's sermons.    CHAPTER XII    Opposition begins in the Islands. Warnings to leave. The  work continues to prosper. Visits to new places. The Saints  continue to prosper The saints upon the Islands called upon to  gather. We leave the Islands for a season    I spent the new year's day in visiting the  Saints and neighbours and found the solemnities of eternity  resting upon the people some crying "What shall I do to be  saved." In the afternoon I met a congregation at Capt Charles  Brown's and led three persons down into the sea and baptised  them. They were Capt Charles Brown and Capt Jesse   Coombs and his wife. We had an interesting time in  the confirmation. After meeting^,^ in company of Mrs  Woodruff I went in a boat to brother Thomas Arey's and  spent the evening with a number of Saints in reading  singing and prayer    On the 13th I crossed to the North Island  to visit the Saints and also to see Elder Joseph Ball who  had come to labour with me in the ministry. I found  him at brother J. Ames'. He had baptized six persons  namely Malatire Luce Ruth Luce Stephen Luce Nathaniel and  Susan Thomas and Nancy Kent.    While holding a meeting on the 15th there  were manifested signs that Satan was gathering his forces 
 [blank space]    April the 14th was spent with the Presidency Twelve  and Missionaries who met at the Seventies Hall. We had an addresses  from President Young and others. In the evening I met with  the Universal Scientific Society in their annual meeting    Next Sunday I met with the quorum  of the Twelve and missionaries in the Seventies Hall and  ordained men to the ministry. There were over 100 set  apart by the laying on of hands to their various missions  among the Lamanites. This was done by the Twelve  and Seventies. I blessed about 40 missionaries and ordained  10 to the office of the Seventies in company with Joseph  Young ^and A. P. Rockwood^ Presidents of the Seventies. The missionaries were  addressed by Orson Hyde and E. T. Benson    Our meeting with the missionaries closed  at 3 o'clock. We then went to the Prayer Circle and arrangements  were made for us to go South with President Young    On the evening of the 25th I attended the first  meeting of the Deseret Theological Society. The Presidency  Twelve and a large number of the Saints were present. We had an  ^interesting address from President Young which theology which was reported.^    Sunday the 29th I spent at home writing  an account of Joseph's interview with the Pottawatamie chiefs  (See Appendix).    Orson Hyde preached that day and Orson Pratt 
 bury him at 2 o'clock.    We met according to advise at 2 oclock at the   house of our departed brother and President Heber C. Kimball took   charge of the ceremony. President Brigham Young was not   able to be present with us.    George A Smith made the prayer. He   prayed earnestly thatfor President Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball   and the person who should be chosen as Willard Richard's successor   also for the Twelve Apostles that they might prove true to their   integrity as brother Richards had done even unto the end. He   prayed for the wives and children of our lamented friend and brother   and that the Spirit of Willard might rest upon his oldest son   Heber John that he might stand at the head of his father's   house in dignity and honour. Elder Watt reported his prayer in   detail    At the close of the prayer the procession was formed.   Brother Kimball and Bishop Hunter walked in front of the cor[p]se   and the Twelve Apostles walked by the side of it while his wives   children relatives and friends followed and a procession formed   behind them and as he was borne to his grave two bands played   a solemn death march.    After our brother was lowered into his grave   Orson Hyde delivered a short appropriate address and while his   remarks were being made the times which I had spent with   brother Richards in a foreign country came to my mind and   I felt solemn and lonesome under the reflection    After the burial I called upon the   family and conversed with them and then attended prayer   meeting with the Twleve; and with Brother Kimball and   Franklin Richards returned to Willard Richards family   and spent the evening with them and brother Kimball conversed   with them till 9 o'clock and gave them much counsel. He 
 preached a very interesting discourse at the Tabernacle on the resurrection  of the dead.    The grashshoppers were destroying this year nearly all the crops.    Dedication of the Endowment House  May the 5th 1855    I met with the Presidency and Twelve in the House of the Lord  built upon the Temple Block and we dedicated it before the Lord. Brother  Ezra T. Benson opened by prayer and after the usual ceremonies Heber  C. Kimball proceeded to dedicate the house by prayer. He named in  his dedication prayer every room from top to botton; every wall and  the materials adobies sand clay stone lime, from the foundation to the  top and prayed that the Spirit of God might enter into it that it might  be clean sweet and holy and that no unclean thing might enter itnto  it so that holy men women God and angels might visit this house  dedicated unto the Lord.    President Young said he would name it  the House of God and when the Temple is built he would call  it the Temple of our God.    This house was dedicated by Brigham Young  Heber C. Kimball Jedediah M. Grant Orson Hydee Orson Pratt  Wilford Woodruff Daniel H. Wells E. D. Wooley Dr Sprague  and James Cummings.    After we closed the dedication several  missionaries received their endowments.    On Sunday the 6th George Q. Cannon preached  or gave a narative of his mission to the Sandwich Islands the  customs of the natives and the special manifestation of the work  of God among them.    After meeting I attended the prayer circle where we 
 to oppose our inroads upon his kingdom. Elder Ball was  speaking when a canon or swivel was discharged near the house  on the sea shore followed quickly by a discharge of small arms  I arose, the Spirit of God rested upon me, and I declared the  word of God unto the people in great plainness while my words  were at times missed with the report of musketry outside the  house. I was plain in declaring the judgements of God, and  called upon the congregation to know if any wished to be baptised  when two arose and offered themselves for the ordinance.    The next day we met a company upon  the beach to attend to the ordinance of baptism. After  singing a hymn I led a man down into the water and  baptized him; and as on the night previous we were  saluted with the report of fire arms. From thence we  went to the east school house to hold a meeting which  was interupted by a mob. As soon as we began  they commenced to disturb us by walking across the house  and talking whistling singing dancing &c. We were  forced to close in confusion    We lear[n]t the day after that Notices were  posted up in conspicuous parts warning us to leave the  town but we concluded to obey God rather than man  so we continued in our Master's business.    On this day we held a prayer-meeting  when two offered themselves for baptism and on the  following one we baptized three more and held another  prayer-meeting at night. The day after I crossed the  Thoroughfare and held a meeting at Isaac Crocketts when  the power of God rested upon us and we prophesied and  spoke in tongues. Capt Isaac Crockett and William   Merchant offered themselves for baptism which was  attended to on the morrow.    Thus in spite of the hinderences which  Satan sought to put in our way and much opposition  from the Rev Mr Douglass, the Methodist priest, the  work of God prospered and we continued travelling  through the Islands engaged in daily ministerial labours    Nearly a month later Feb 13th we  crossed the bay to Camden and on the next day 
 said that he believed the Saints the other side of the veil are gathered together   the same as they are in the life while the world are scattered over the earth after   death the same as they are now and in the same confussion and that there   would be head quarters of the gathering from which they would send out   missionaries to preach the Gospel to the Spirits in prison. Brother Kimball   advised the females to hold together and remain as they were on Brother Willards  inheritance and not marry again but to keep themselves for him and to be   united together and assist each other all they could.    The second day from this I spent in the Council House   with brother Kimball and the Twelve. Brother Kimball was speaking   upon principle and giving counsel for four hours.    On the 18th I rode to Grantsville and on the next day   which was Sunday I preached to them and gave them counsel to close up   their fort. There were many Indians there who were friendly.   After meeting I rode 12 miles to Toille City and preached to the   people in the evening    Next day with brother Maugn I rode to brother   Bates and from thence to the new city near Benson's Mill and held a   meeting with the people who all agreed to build in a fort. The day   following I returned to Salt Lake City    On the 27 the Twelve met at my house in the   evening to bless the missionaries who were going to England. We had   a good meeting. Elder Franklin Richards was to preside over the   British Mission. He received his blessing on the Sunday evening   which was the 26th. Those who received their blessings this   evening were George Grant Wm Kimball Edmund Elsworth James   A. Little ^Joseph A Young^ and another brother. We also blessed brother Kesler  and Hallaiday to go to the States.    Sunday April the 2nd I attended meeting   in the Tabernacle. In the morning Elder Parley P. Pratt   spoke and Wilford Woodruff followed. In the afternoon   J. M. Grant addressed the congregation 
 had some important and interesting teachings which was ^were^ not reported.  The follow is a key to his remarks brought out in social conversation    Views of President Young on the Fall and Resurrection    He referred to the preaching of Orson Hyde and Orson Pratt  the Sabbath before upon the subject of the resurrection. He said  the identicals particles of matter in which we had honored our spirits  i.e. our tabernacles in which we had suffered travelled labored and  built up the Kingdom of God they would be the identical bodies and  no other. They would be raised from the grave to immortality  and eternal lives    He said Adam and Eve had lived upon another  earth and were immortal when they came here. Adam assisted  in forming this earth and agreed to fall when he came here and he  fell that man might be; and the opposite principle to good—  the Devil the Serpaent the Evil was placed upon the earth that  man might know the good from the evil for without an  experience in those things men could not know one from the  other.    As soon as the Devil was upon the earth he sowed  the seeds of death in everything; so that as soon as Adam  and Eve began to eat of the fruit of the earth they received  into their systems the seeds of mortality and of death. So  their children were mortal and subject to death sorrow and pain  who then when they partook of life joy ease and happiness  would know how to prise it. Father Adam would never  cease his labors to redeem his posterity and exalt them to all  the glory they were capable of receiving. He did not doubt  that Father Adam knew in the beginning how many  of his posterity would receive a celestial glory and who  they were and also of a terrestial and a telestial; yet man had 
 walked to the Simonton district where I met brother James Townsend  from the Saco Church. At night we preached in the School house  at this place.    I left on the following day with Elder Ball and  James Towndsend to go a distance of three miles. On our way  we repaired to a Grove to hold a Council and the Holy Ghost said  Seperate unto ne [me] James for the ministry. So we ordained  him to the office of an Elder. Although alone in a Grove and  surround with snow we had a good time for the Spirit of  God rested upon us. We spent the evening at bro Ames' in  an interesting manner by expressing to each other our feelings    On the 17th I left brother Ebenezer Ames  with Elder James Townsend for Searsmount and Elder Hall [Ball] was  to return to the Island. The roads were drifted with snow  and the people feared we could not get through but we  went forward in the Lord. The winds were high and  the air was filled with snow. We broke the roads for  seven miles and three of it was across a pond. We reached  our destination at 2 o'clock p.m. and was kindly entertained  by Mr H. Richards.    The day following was Sunday when I preached  on the Book of Mormon and continued in Searsmount visiting  and preaching on each of the next three days. On the Monday  going to the school house to preach I had one of my ears frozen.    We parted from the friends, whom we had  made in Searsmount, on the 22nd and walked 15 miles to  Belfast where after being rejected by eight households we were  kindly received and entertained by Mr Thomas Tapply.    On the morrow we visited arround the village  of Belfast calling upon many of the principal men. We  procured a place for preaching and according to appointment  met several hundred citizens in the brick school house to whom  I preached the Gospel. They desired to hear farther upon  the subject and wished to purchase the Book of Mormon    We went to Northport on the 24th where  we preached that evening and the next day being Sunday  I preached twice. In the evening the congregation was large  The people listened with profound attention and treated me [with]  great respect and kindness. 
 1854    General Conference  Of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  Held in the Tabernacle Great Salt Lake City  April 6th 1854    The Conference commenced at 10 A.M.    There were in the Stand Presidents Brigham Young  and Heber C. Kimball    Patriarch—Isaac Morley.  Of the Twelve Apostles—Orson Hyde, Parley P. Pratt   Wilford Woodruff John Taylor George A Smith E. T. Benson  Lorenzo Snow and Erastus Snow.    Presidents of Seventies Joseph Young H. Herriman  Zera Pulsipher A. P. Rockwood J. M. Grant Levi Hancock  and B. L. Clapp    Presiding Bishop—Edward Hunter.  Presidency of the Stake D. Fullmer Thomas Rhoads & P. H. Young  Clerk of the Conference—Thomas Bullock   Reporter—George D. Watt.    Conference was called to order by President Brigham Young   and after the singing President Kimball offered up a prayer    President Young then arose and spoke upon the   death of  President Willard Richards and concerning filling his p[l]ace   in the Presidency. Upon this subject at the close of his discourse   the President said    "When the time comes to present before you the   quorums we shall probably supply the vacancy made by   the death of brother Willard Richards. Who will supply his 
 his agency to act chose and refuse good or evil as pleased him and he would  be rewarded according to his works.    Orson Pratt asked, "Will ^Adam^ or any God continue to make  worlds people them and taste of death to redeem them?    Answer: I have no doubt that it is his privilege but  whether he will do it is a question in my mind    Question: How then can his seed increase to all eternity?  Answer: Through the increase of his posterity.    Many other remarks were made by the President    Visit South    The Presidency and his company started on the 8th to visit the southern  Settlements as far as Iron County. I was not in the city when  they started but returning from Toille. I followed on the 9th and  overtook the company next day    In jouring on the 12th we visited a splendid  coal mine. The vein was about 6 feet thick. It dipped to the  West about 20 degrees. The coal was of excellent quality and  we brought some of it along with us. This coal bed was in  sight on both sides of the Kanyon and was about 10 miles  N.N.W. from Fort Ephraim.    We reached Fort Ephraim that night and held   a meeting. Presidents Heber C. Kimball and Jedediah M. Grant  preached to the people    Description of Fort Ephraim  in 1855    Fort Ephraim was laid out with an inner fort 12 1/2 by 15  rods wide built with a stone wall 2 feet thick 10 feet high 
 place in the First Presidency? is a question that has not yet been answered though   many have talked to me about it. I have asked the Twelve to dictate this   part of the business but they have thrown it back. Well I will say where   it ought to be. They said it was not their place to dictate the affair   but to confirm the conclusions of the President. If the Conference will   show the best method of knowing who is the best man to be my   Second Counsillor I will readily listen to their wisdom. The Twelve   would have nothing to do with it but said it was the privilege of   the President to choose his own Counsellor and for them to run the   risk of its being right or wrong. However if the Conference wish   to dictate this matter I will give them an opportunity. That is   my method of doing business; as long as we are of one heart   and of one mind there is no ground for discord or dissension."    The President also spoke upon the subject of   appointing new gathering places designing to establish three or four   new locations for this purpose East and West especially ^for^ the emigration   from Europe    In the afternoon Orson Hyde addressed the meeting   and was followed by George A Smith and President Young upon   the subject of the Indian war    I met in council with President Young and council   and the quorum of the Twelve and Parley P. Pratt was appointed   to go to Horner's Ranch in California to establish a Stake.   Erastus Snow was appointed to go to St Louis to take charge of   the Saints in that region and Orson Pratt to take charge of the   Stake in Cincinnatti    The subject of consecration came up the next   day. Touching the matter President Kimball said that   what President Young had presented to the people to carry out   was only what we had in our houses for years. All have to be   purchased. I want all I have to be secured in the Kingdom   of God. If the Presidency and Twelve enter into this order they 
 We left Northport in good feelings and spirit and  walked to Belfast and thence to Frankfort a distance of  20 miles in the day. We preached in Frankfort twice  on the 27th and on the day following went to Hampden  which we left on the next and walked to the city of Bangor  which contained a population of 10,000.    This day was my [birthday] being March the 1st. I was  now 31 years of age. We visited Mr Haywood the city  clerk and General Isaac Hodson and other citizens and  appointed a meeting at the City Hall where in the evening  I preached upon the authenticity of the Book of Mormon  and left another appointment.    The forepart of the ^next^ day was spent in our  wandering over the city of Bangor. We were the first  Elders of the Church who visited this city or lifted a  warning voice in this place to the people. We were  as great strangers in the cities of the Gentiles which  we visited as were Abraham Isaac and Jacob in  their day.    We attended court in the City Hall in  the afternoon and in the evening met a congregation  of citizens at the hour appointed and preached  to them upon the first principles of the Gospel to  which the people listened with attention.    On the morrow we walked to Hampden  where we preached that night and also on the next day  Sunday two discourses in the Universalists Chapel.    March 5th we left Hampden walked 25 miles  to Farnham and next day walked to Castene and took  passage on board the Two-friends. We were becalmed on  the way. Capt. Carlton myself and brother Townsend  entered a small boat to row to the shore a distance  of about five miles. When half waw [way] the wind arose and  the vessel overtook us and we again went on board.  We reached Capt Carlton's about 8 p.m. and spent the  night with him and also the next day; and preached  in the school house.    On the 8th leaving the Isle of Hold and  crossed per Mail boat to North Fox Island where I had 
 and finished. Besides this there was an outside wall built of  splendid white limestone 4 feet thick at the bottom 2 feet at the top  18 feet high 60 rods in length and 44 rods wideth from side to side  of the fort.    The city contained 400 inhabitants two thirds of whom  were Danish. They haved a school taught by a man in the  Winter and a woman in the Summer. This city had been  established about one year yet the inside wall was built    The intention of the inhabitants was to build    Next day was Sunday. Meeting commenced at 10 o'clock  The Danish brethren sang. President J. M Grant preached and  was followed by President Heber C Kimball and President Brigham  Young. Wilford Woodruff reported.    At the close of the meeting the company rode to  Manti and held a meeting. Brother Cherry lost his horses and as I  rode with him I did not get to Manti until near dark so that I  could not attend meeting    On my arrival President Young requested me  to get the brethren together who were appointed to go to the Elk  Mountain and set them apart for their mission    Accordingly we met the missionaries andt the house  of brother Billings and President Grant and myself set apart 12 persons  to the Elk Mountain and 2 to Las Vegas. We ordained  6 to the quorums of Seventies. The whole number appointed  and set apart to the Elk Mountain was 40. President Grant  addressed them in the Spirit and power of God and was followed by  Truman O Angel and Wilford Woodruff. I reported the address  of President J. M. Grant.    The City of Manti 
 will swalllow up the whole cChurch in a little time and also the whole   world as Joseph did in Egypt. The plurality of wives was established   and many of you have fought it. You may fight it until you go into   your graves and it will still be the work of God and will continue   to be to all eternity."    President Young followed upon the subject of   consecration.    In the afternoon all took seats on the outside of the Tabernacle.  There were about 7000 persons present. Parley P. Pratt addressed them.    The following persons were called to go on missions:  Parley P. Pratt to San Jose, Orson Pratt and Orson Spencer to   Cincinnati to establish a gathering place and Erastus Snow to   St Louis for the same purpose.    Eli Bell William Clough, M. Devalsen Merrick   Joseph A Peck, John West and William King to the Pacific Islands    James M. Barlow James McGaw Franklin Worley,   Haden W. Church Charles Bassett, William Martindale, Albert   Crandell to the United States    Next day others were appointed for missions—   John Tome Wm C. Dunbar and Thomas Latyey to England and John   Murdock Patriarch to go to Iron County.    On the second day of the Conference there were appointed  to England—Franklin ^D^ Richards (to preside) James A Little George   D Grant, Joseph A Young, Wm. H. Kimball Wm. G.

 the privilege of again meeting the Saints and my wife. Mrs  Woodruff gave me five letters received in my absence. One was  from my parents and one from brother Asahel. There were  also two from Elder Milton Holmes and one from Elder Robins  from Kirtland.    These letters contained much news especially  the one from Kirtland which informed me that trouble  had come upon the Church there. Numbers had been  cut off for transgression division was among the Saints  the printing office had been burned to the ground by  a mob with all its contents of books worth about 1500 dollars  Warren Parrish and others who had been cut off the Church  were joining with the world to injure the influence of  the Saints and Joseph and Sidney had gone to Far west  with their families. The faithful were to follow them  for Kirtland will be scourged. Often had I heard  Joseph prophesy of these things for a year past    The next day I wrote two letters one of them  to the Bishop and Presidency in Zion and the interval of  the next two weeks was filled up about as usual.    On the 22nd bro Starrett and myself at  low tide went on the bar to dig clams. Sister Stone and  my wife came out to see us. And while we were  busy engaged in this the tide arose and flowed betwen  us and the shore. We were under the necessity of  wading through the water ourselves and carrying the  woman ashore in an arm chair. Having got fairly  through the task we concluded that we should not soon  forget the place and returned home with our clams.    On the 28th I received three letters two  from our friends in Scarborough and one from Jonathan  Hale from Kirtland. It contained an account of the  Saints leaving that place for the land of Zion and of  the judgments of God that was overtaking it and about  to come upon the whole land. He sent me the counsel of  the Presidency of our quorum which was that I should  teach the Saints upon the Islands of the sea to imme-  diately sell their property and prepare themselves to go  up to the land of Zion. 
 At this date the City of Manti contained a population of  of 140 families and about 560 souls. They had 2 shchools and 100 scholars  in the Winter and 50 in the Summer. The city contained an inside  fort built of stone 10 rods square 2 feet thick and 10 feet high. Their outside  wall was 102 f rods square 3 feet thick at the bottom 18 inches at the top and  12 feet high. This wall was finished 8 feet high and 40 rods of it was  completed to the 12 feet height    We left Manti on the Monday rode to the severe  Bridge crossed it and continued 2 miles and camped for the night by the cedars  We met with brothers Charles C Rich and George Q. Cannon at the severe  Bridge and they camped with us at night    After a disagreeable day's journey through a cloud of  dust blown in our faces by a high wind we reached Filmore and held  meeting with the people of the city at 5 o'clock. Presidents Young  Kimball and J. M. Grant preached and Wilford Woodruff reported  At the close of the meeting in company with J. M Grant I visited  the wing of the State House. It was a noble edifice    Filmore City: Filmore City contained 100 families numbering  500 souls at that date. The enclosure was 1/4 of a mile square 10 feet  high and 20 inches thick. Of half was adobies and the other half  pickets. The enclosure was all built. The city was designed  to include 200 lots 1 1/4 acres per lot making 24 blocks. They had quite  a commodious meeting house finished and had 2 schools and seventy  five scholars. The wing of the State House was 61 feet  8 inches long and 40 feet 4 inches wide on the ground. The  basement story is 10 feet high the 2nd story 12 feet and the  third or upper story 19 feet making the side walls including the width  of joist 43 feet 6 inches in height. The battlement end was about  10 feet higher thean the sides. The basement had an alley running  length ways through the building 7 feet wide. Each side was divided 
 Henry P. Richards Smith Thurston Edward Patridge and Ward Pack    To British North America George P. Waugh.    To the United States George W Hickerson & William W. Rust were appointed in the   afternoon.    To Canada—James C. Sly Amos Gustin    To England—Samuel Powell Richard E Waddington Wm Benjamin   Hodgetts.    James Ferguson to Ireland    On the second day of the Conference the authorities were also presented and   sustained.    In place of Willard Richards deceased President Young nominated   George A Smith to be the Church Historian and General Church Recorder   which was unanimously sustained    President Young nominated Heber C. Kimball to continue   as his First Counsellor and Jedediah M. Grant as his Second Counsellor   to fill the place of Willard Richards    On the 9th of April the Conference was brought to   a close by President Young and adjourned until the 27 of the next June    The Seventies Apostles    After the close of the Conference I attended prayer meeting with the Presidency   and Twelve while remarking upon the offices of the Priesthood President Young   said that the Seventies held all the keys in the Church and Kingdom of   God on earth and if the Twelve were dead they would have to ordain all the   officers of the Church for they are all High Priests and Apostles. I told   Joseph Young to have the Seventies all ordained Apostles    On the evening of the 23rd I met with the Missionaries   in company with Orson Hyde Parley P. Pratt J. Taylor George A. Smith   and Erastus Snow of the Twleve and we blessed about forty Elders   who were set apart to go to the various nations of the earth. At   the close of the blessings they were addressed by Parley Pratt upon   their outfit &c and journey across the Plain: George A Smith 
 The Lord was manifesting his work to the Saints  upon the Islands of the sea in dreams visions signs  healings and wonders. One remarkable circumstance  I will mention.    Mr Ebenezer Carver had been earnestly  investigating the Gospel and while desiring to know the  truth of it he walked towards the sea shore and desiring  that he might have some signs. But the word of God  upon which he was meditating was that there should be  no sign given but the sign of the Prophet Jonas [##Matthew 12:39##]    On a sudden there was a large fish arose  on the water in the sea at a distance from him and  it as suddenly sunk out of sight. He desired again  to see it and immediately the fish arose a second  time upon the top of the water accompanied by another  fish of the same species and size. One of them swam  in a straight line on the top of the water towards Mr  Carver as he stood upon the beach. When the fish  came as near his feet as the water would permit  it looked at the man with a penetrating eye as though  it had a message for him. The fish then returned  to its mate and swam out of sight.    Mr Carver returned home meditating upon  the strange sight. It is worthy of remark that this  took place at a time of the year when fish of that  size is not known upon these shores and they never  at any season come ashore as in this case. Thus I  was informed and Mr Carver had dreams confirming that  it was a sign to him.    Two days later, April 1st I preached to  a large congregation at Mr Carver's and after the meeting  baptized his wife where the fish came to him. Many  were beleiving.    But about this time Warren Parrish  who had travelled with me in the ministry but who  was now cut off from the Church wrote to the Post-  master of this Island a long letter against the work  of God whose advocate he had once been. He spoke  favourably of my character but said that I was deceived 
 into 4 rooms each. The second story had the same width alley running  through the building and the sides were divided into three rooms each, the  upper story was to be finished into one room or hall. The basement  story wall was three feet thick and the remainder of the building 2 feet  thick. At this time the cornish was on and a part of the roof  shingled.    All the way from Great Salt Lake City on our journey  to Fillmore we found nearly all the crops of wheat eaten up  by the grasshopers    We stayed at Filmore one night and on the morrow  we journeyed to Corn Creek which contained a settlement of Indians  of the Parvaosts ^Parvants^. David Kaanosh Tashobets was their  principal Chief    We stoped a short time with the Indians and  about a dozen of them with their chiefs mounted their horses and  rode with us on our journey. The Indians shot prarie dogs  and rabbits for their supper. They roasted the dogs a little and then  eat them entrails young ones and all. We camped at Cove^rn^ Creek  after a distance of 40 miles travel during the day.    Two days later we reached Parowan. Here  we met George A. Smith and visited his flouring mill which  was a good establishment    In the evening we held a meeting with the  people. President Young preached upon the law of consecration  and Wilford Woodruff reported it    The mail from California came in the  day previous and brought me a letter from Edward Partridge and  2 numbers of the "Mormon" published by John Taylor at  New York.    Next day we reached Cedar. I stoped with  brother Jonathan Pugmire and after dinner visited the ironworks  I was rejoiced to find them in full blast making good iron 
 addressed them upon keeping journals and histories of their travels and the dealings   of God with them in their ministry    Elders John Taylor and Orson Hyde also addressed them   Several days previous to this we blessed 35 other missionaries    Sunday the 30th I visited Father John Smith the Patriarch who   laid at the point of death. His sons George A Smith and John L. Smith   were watching over him with the greatest care and attention. His mind   and memory were as clear and strong and his intellectual powers as operative   as in any day of his life.    Journey South    May the 3rd Presidents Young and Kimball with a company   left the city to visit all the Southern settlements. I left with them   Truman O. Angel and Dr Sprague as my companions. I drove to   Bishop Smoots at the Sugar Works and stoped until brother Angel   layed out a part of the works. Mrs Woodruff and child rode down   with me and here I parted from them and we drove to Union Ward   over which Silas Richards was Bishop    We held a meeting in the evening: President Young   addressed the people. I was not in at the commencement and had   no chance of reporting his discourse. The following is a key to his   address which I have written from memory    Synopsis of a Discourse of President Young.    "I do not wish to spend my time neither is it profitable for   any man to spend his time in telling the people what was done in   the days of Adam Enoch and Noah thousands of years ago but my   business is to tell the people what they should do to day in order to   be saved. This is my doctrine all the time. What can I do   or this people do to-day in any one thing in order to build up the   kingdom of God or to advance any step farther towards the salvation 
 This letter was written for the purpose of being made  public and was for that reason addressed to the Postmaster. It  was read by the people beleived by many and used by our  opposers causing persecution to rage. The letter was also handed  to me by the Postmaster to read.    It might be here stated that Warren Parrish  fell through disappointed ambition. He aspired to the  quorum of the Twelve or to be a leading spirit of the  Church. He was what is termed a smart man and  through his smartness distorted by ambition and envy  and the bitterness thereof he turned against Joseph and  the Church, having fallen into darkness and given himself  up to the power of Satan    Notwithstanding the letter of Warren Parrish  and the opposition which we met we continued to increase  our numbers. On the 7th I baptized Ephraim Luce  and Margarett Crockett and confirmed them by the  laying on of hands. Sister Luce was also healed of  sickness by the imposition of hands. I then walked  to Mr Ebenezer Carver's and preached to the people and  afterwards preached ^baptised^ Mrs Abigal Carver. She was over  70 years of age and had not been to a neighbour's house  for six years; but on this occasion she went with  spirit to the sea shore and was baptized and returned  strengthened in body and mind.    A Conference of Elders met agreeable to our  appointment at the house of Bro Justus Ames on North Fox  Island Vinal Haven on the 13th of April. Elders Milton   Holmes and James Townsend and Priest Abner Rogers had  come to attend it. North Fox Island was represented  by myself as containing 25 members in good standing  and also 3 members in Camden. Elder Holmes represented  the New Rowley Branch containing 11 members in good standing.  During this Conference there were several ordained and one  baptized.    Several days after my wife started from the  Island to return to her father's house and I soon after  also left the Islands of the sea for it was manifested unto  us by revelation that it was our duty to take a western 
 and casting pipes cranks and what they needed about the works. They had  tried for several years to make iron but could not accomplish it until ^of^ late  The Presidency and most of the company were present to see them cast and  was much pleased. We examined the works, coak coal and ore of  different kinds and took specimens with us, and then returned to the  city from which the ironworks were situated about one mile    Cedar City contained one hundred and forty five  families with 725 souls. Their fort was surrounded with a wall  half a mile square 8 feet high and 18 inches thick built of adobies and  stones. They had 145 buildings and very good ones for the time the  place had been settled. There was also a tithing office 43 by  25 feet two stories a good cellar and the upper room finished. It  cost 25 hundred dollars. The main portion of the building was  not finished. They had a meeting house 60 by 25 feet and  had three schools during the Winter two men schools and one  female; and there were two schools during the Summer  The Settlement much needed men and teems to carry on their ironworks    We held a council in the evening. The Presidency  and Twelve were present. The time was spent in chit chat upon the  consecration and other things    In the afternoon of Sunday the 20th of  May at the commencement of the meeting President Young said "We  have some Church business to attend to and I remove that we resolve  ourselves into a Special Conference." It was seconded and carried  unanimously    It was then moved and carried that Isaac Haight  be appointed the President of this stake of Zion which embraces  the ^ceder^ city of Harmony and Johnson's Fort; and that he choose his  two counsellors.    It was moved and carried that Jonathan Pugmire Sen  Robert Willey Samuel White Richard Harrison Perry Liston  Iria Allen Samuel Lee Laban Morrel Rufus C Allen 
 of ourselves or our brethren    Now what has been the councisel to this people for several years   past? It has been to ^build^ f^or^t^s^ up; to wall in your cities with strong walls   This has been the voice of the Lord unto them all the day long. Have the   people listened to this voice? Have they carried out this counsel? No   they have not? But what have they done? They have been ready to say   what nead hath the Lord of this thing? Do you realthink there is any danger   of the Indians? Do you think that brother Brigham really believes that   it is necessary to go to so much expence in building walls around our cities?  Instead of going to work and doing what they are told to do the people   spend their time in talking about it and trying to evade it.    Now I wish to ask a question. The Lord has appointed   me to lead this people. The people have chosen me as their leader   and covenanted to sustain me and obey my counsel. Now if I tell   the people what to do and they do not do it nor carry out my counsel   but turn from it and go to work and do something else and they continue   this year after year while at the same time I am warning them of   the danger of their course and telling them of the judgements which will   come upon them if they do not alter their course and go to work and   do as I have told them do you suppose they will escape the chastening   rod of the Almighty? No they will not.    If the people continue to pursue their present  course and the chastening rod does not fall upon their heads I should   become disregarded in the sight of God angels and men. This people   may rest assured that they are preparing a rod for their ^own^ backs if they   do not listen to my counsel and do what I tell them    But says one I would go to work and help build   a wall around the city if I knew it was a revelation from God and   that it was His will we should do it. I want to say to such that   it is my will that you should do it and that it is enough. I am   responsible for it and if you want to know any farther about   it do right. Pray unto the Lord and have faith before him that   you may have visions and revelations from God so that you 
 mission and leave the Islands for a season; for they  been faithfully warned the Saints sought out and the  enemy were combined in secret places against who  would take our lives if in their power.    I left on the morning of the 28th of April  in company of Priest Thomas and brother M. Luce.  We went in a sail boat. The wind being against us  we had to row hard against both wind and tide for  six miles. We then changed our course and hoisted  one sail which with the help of one oar gave us more  speed and after rowing and sailing 20 miles we landed  about noon at Owl's head.    The next day we walked 40 miles and  suffered much during the day with blistered feet and  weary limbs. This was also the case on our next  day's journey of 30 miles. But on the afternoon of  this day we arrived at Father Carter's and I had  the privilege of again meeting my friends and wife  whom I found all in good health and spirits    I only remained at the house of my father-  in-laaw seven days and I again bid adieu to my  wife and her father's household and in company of  Milton Holmes continued my travels in the ministry.    On the first day we journeyed 35 miles  and on the next walked to the Navy-yard Portsmouth N. H.  Here we spent several hours and had an interesting view  of the war ships cannon balls shot &c. We visited one  frigate of sixty guns and a ship of war of 120 guns  We also visited the building where her rigging anchors  &c were kept. We then walked 20 miles farther  to Georgetown making a distance in the day of  35 miles.    I spent several ^the next^ days at Father Holmes'  and on the next I bid adieu to Father Homes and family  His son Milton remained but Elder Joseph Ball became  my companion and we started and walked to Salem  This is the renowned place where so many where executed  on the charge of whitchcraft so that the story of the  Salem whitches has become a household tale. 
 may understand the truth and know what lies before us as I do and then   you will not question the reasonableness of these things but go to   work and do them with all your might    My teaching is to tell the people what to do   to be saved to-day for if you get out of the path of salvation to day   you are in danger of being out of it to-morrow and the farther you   stray from it the more difficulty you will meet in ever finding   it again    It would be folly in my spending my time in telling the   people about the glories of the Millennium while I see them straying   from those paths that would lead to those glories    Now many of this people will say I have fine   farms horses cattle goods gold and riches. The possessor says I   look upon them; I say these are mine. At the same time   you do not once think that there is not one thing in your possession   that is yours. It all belongs to God; and even you yourselves   belong to God. All you have belong[s] to Him and He has   only loaned it to you and yet you do not acknowledge his hand   in anything while you should acknowledge his hand in all things    I know what the design of the Lord is in   leading the people to this place and his design concerning Israel   and it is none of your business what I counsel you to do. It is   your business to go to work and do it. Leave the event   with God.    I want this people to build their forts as I tell them   and when you have built this fort and made a wall six feet thick   and twelve feet high and get comfortable in your houses then go   to work and build one on the outside 12 feet thick and run them   both up together 25 feet high and keep building until I tell you   to stop and be in a situation that you may shut up your gates   and lie down and sleep in f safety with your wives and children.    Many other interesting remarks were made   by the President which I was not able to record 
 The 11th of May was the following day and it was a  most interesting one indeed. I arose in the morning, refreshed  by sleep and took breakfast with Father ^Alley^ at whose house we  stayed. We then [took] our farewell of him and sister Alley and  walked to Chelsea and thence to Charleston    Here we visited the Bunker Hill monument and  walked upon the entrenchments that was flung up by our  brave fathers during the night preceding that memorable battle  upon Bunker Hill. But the roar of cannon and the clash  of arms had long ceased but the sound from the populous  city of Boston was now buzzing through the air while  our fathers were sleeping in peace.    As we passed along we had a good view  of the Navy yard and thence we entered the City of Boston  This was the first time my feet trod its streets or my  eyes beheld its wealth.    I spent several hours in visiting the city  which at that time contained a population of one hundred  thousand. The market-place of Boston was probably  as neat beautiful and well furnished as any one in  America. The starchhouse which we visited was also  a fine place. We went to the Cupalo and had a  fair view of the whole city. I walked around the  commons which was inclosed with an iron railing of  about 2 1/2 miles in length. We visited the Tremont House  the most noted place house in the city, and also the shiping  We dined at Mr Thayre's in Belknap Street upon a rich  salmon, called upon several of the Saints during the day  visited South Boston and had a fair view of the  splendid Mount Washington House a place of entertainment  for gentlemen who wish to retire from the bustle and  noise of the city.    I next walked over longbridge to Cambridge  & from thence to Cambridge point. I went to the goal in  order to have an interview with Albert P. Rockwood and  to comfort him.    Brother Rockwood had been cast into prison  by his enemies for debts in order to trouble and distress  him. 
 full house. President Young addressed the people at the close of which  John P. Hall Charles Hall Predgly Meeks Horace M Alexander, Samuel  Gool and Elijah Elmer were called to fill up the vacancy in the High  Council. We then repared to the upper room of George A Smith and  we ordained the High Council and set them apart to their offices. Four  of them were also ordained High Priests. They were set apart and ordained  under the hands of Jededhiah M. Grant Wilford Woodruff and ^J. C. L^  Smith. J. M. Grant Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith  also set apart John Steel and Wm C Mitchel to their mission to  Loss Vegas    Parawan.    at this date contained 400 inhabitants. Their wall was 108 rods  square 12 feet high seven feet ^height^ of which was built. It was 6 feet  thick at the bottom and two and a half feet thick at the top with four  gates. The wall was made of earth. Parawan contained  eighty dwellings some of which were two stories high and the houses  good ones. Their meeting house was 48 by 22 feet with two  ^Ells^ 16 feet square 2 stories high 3 rooms above and one finished  for prayer circle. There was a school-house 22 by 18 feet  one grist mill 35 by 30 on the ground three stories high. The  mill was at work and belonged to George A. Smith ^and J C L Smith.^ Their were  a shash and chair factory machine shop and three ^two^ blacksmiths  shops. Their public square was 10 acres; a liberty pole  87 feet. There was one man school with 120 scholars  Their big field contained 1120 acres enclosed with a good fence  John C L. Smith was President and Tarlton Lewis Bishop    We left Parawan on the 22nd and reached  Filmore on the morning of the 24th where we held meeting and  then rode 24 miles to Lake Valley. The missionaries destined  to the White Mountains under the Presidency of Bishop Evans  arrived in our camp 
 May the 5th, we left Union Fort for Dry Creek Settlement, made   a short stay there and then drove on to American Fork where at night we   assembled the people for meeting. They were addresed by Wilford Woodruff  Heber C. Kimball and Brigham Young.    Saturday the 6th we drove to Battle Creek and assembled   the people for meeting.    Address By President Young    President Young arose and said:    "I am not in the habit of taking a   text but I will now take for my text the last lines that were sung: "God   is his own interpreter and he will make it plain."    But do the people understand those things which are   for our good? The Lord will not explain all things unto us. He   understands; but he will make his people walk by faith. He will   not explain all his mysteries to the people. We read in the ##JST, Hebrews 11:1|New   Testament## that faith is the assurance of things hoped for—the evidence   of things not seen.    Have we all got faith? It is our duty to have faith   in God and his word and promise. You have to trust in God.   He will not reveal all things unto us    Some men are tried with the counsel given and   will not obey. They will not have glory in the Kingdom of God   They are bastards and not sons. The Lord intends for the people   to be tried so as to prove the faithful. What God does reveal he   reveals for the purpose of leading men in the way of salvation    The people do not know the way of the Lord   They come here and say I am going to build myself up. I have to   work so hard I cannot get time to pray. But are you doing right   when you do this? We may labour to get all things about us yet   the Lord will control it as seemeth him good    If you get into the dark still hold on to   the work of God. No matter if I don't feel like praying I 
 When I arrived at the prison the jailor permitted  me to enter the room where brother Rockwood was confined  At this time we were strangers after the flesh but related  in the Gospel. This was the first time I had ever  visited an^y^ Elder ^one^ in prison.    After the keeper had turned the key upon  us and left us together I began to enquire into the  state of his mind and found him strong in the  faith. He had the Bible Book of Mormon Parley's  Voice of Warning and the Evening and Morning Star  as his companions which he constantly read    We conversed together about three hours and he  informed me of many things that had transpired while  there. Among the variety he mentioned the goal taking  fire a few days before my visit. He said this looked  like a dark hour. The fire was roaring over his head  while a scene of uproar confusion and distress was  upon every hand; the engines were rapidly playing around  the building water poured into every room the people  hallooing in the streets the prisoners crying for mercy  to be let out lest they should be consumed one of the  number was struggling in the agonies of death while  others were cursing swearing &c. He said he felt composed  through the confused scene until the fire was extinguished    Bro Rockwood was writing his life while  in confinement; and he sent a roll of the same by  me to his wife in Holliston.    At half past 8 o'clock p.m. the jailor came  and unlocked the prison doors and I left brother R. in  spirits and bent my way back to the city of Boston  When crossing the long bridge on my return I heard the  cry of fire the ringings of bells and the ratling of engines  The flames soon illuminated the city but in half an hour  it was extinguished    Being alone and a strange in the darkness  of the night I lost my way in the midst of the city but  after wandering awhile I found No 9 Myrtle Street where  Elder Ball and a company of Saints were patiently waiting  for me. Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour I spent 
 We reached Salt Creek Fort on the 25. It was 104  rods square. The wall 6 feet thick at the bottom 2 1/2 at the top and  it had reached 6 feet in height. This fort contained 80 families and  three hundred and fifty persons.    Provo City in 1855    At this date the city of Provo  was one mile square with a wall the same which was 6 feet thick  at the bottom 2 at the top and 12 feet high. One half of the wall was  finished. Its population was 2500, five hundred families and  houses some of which were good and many improvements were visible  There was one Seminary containing 4 school rooms four schools  were kept containing 100 scholars. There were 2 grist mills  2 saw mills 1 carding machine clothdressing &c and a thi  Tithing office.    Springville in 1855    Springville Fort was 3/4 of a mile square with a wall  12 feet high 6 feet thick at the bottom 2 1/2 at the top. Forty rods  of it was completed and 2 sides 6 feet high. Springville  contained one thousand inhabitants 200 able bodied men 3 schools  one male and 2 female schools    Pason in 1855    Pason was 96 rods square with a wall the same. The wall  was to be 12 feet high 6 feet thick at the bottom and 2 feet at  the top, six feet heaght of which was already built. This  Fort contained 90 families 450 inhabitants 110 able-bodied men  and 3 schools containing 100 scholars. 
 will do it.    If the Lord should open the vision ^of the minds^ of the people who have   gone to California so that they could see things as they are they would   as soon cut their throats as to have done it. But they dont see it: they   have to go and suffer until they are satisfied    I will say the same to this people. If we do   not the things which God requires we shall be whiped until we are   sore. This is the only thing that will save us. I now tell you   that those who are gone and are going to California without counsel   will have it till they are sore    I know the truth but I cannot tell it all   to you until God permits me to do it. Now if you have not   confidence in me to follow me and believe that I am doing right drop   me and appoint another and I will follow in the wake    In the beginning of this work God tried to   get this people to be one but they would not be one. I will tell   you what to do. God intends to make you one. You must be   one and there must be a beginning to this. And you must begin   in small things like children making cob houses.    The people went to Missouri and there   they quarrelled about many small matters. Then God said I   will throw down their good houses; and God drove ^all the people^ out and then   they were knocked into pi. Did they do any better then? No   they did not. God tries his people both with riches and with poverty   If I will ^am^ be faithful in my poverty I will ^shall^ own all riches that is   neadful.    Now God wants us to be of one heart and one mind   He may have no other motive than to make us work together. He   will tell us to build fences and forts that our feelings and interests   may be united in something. Now will you do it? We are   required to become of one heart and mind and work together in these   little things that we do understand or else we could not be prepared   to work together and be one in those eternal things which we do not 
 a season in teaching them the things of God. I then went with  Elder Ball to his mother's house where we spent the night. This  ended a day of variety crowded with incidents. I had also walked  25 miles during the day.    I spent several days in Boston comforting the little  Church there most of whom were sisters. We left on the 14th and  travelled to Deacon John Haven's on the edge of Holliston. Here we  found sister Rockwood. I had the privilege of reading Parley's reply  to Mr Sunderland's articles in the Zion's Watchman. We journeyed  this day 30 miles.    The next we walked to Holliston and spent the day  and at night preached.    On the day following we walked 32 miles to  Providence. We were now in the State of Rhode Island. This  is the SIXTEENTH STATE that I have visited in  my travels.    We went on board of the steamer Rhode Island  at half past 4 p.m. for New York city where we arrived  the next day.    This was the first time that I had beheld the  principal city of America. Several hours were spent in scearch of  some of the Saints and at length found brother David W. Rogers  Gree[nwich street]    After dinner we went to Hamersly Street No 26  where we found Elder Orson Pratt and family. Here we continued  with the New York Saints from the 18th to the 21st on which  day I wrote to the Saints up[on] the Islands of the sea and left with  brother Ball for Newburg per steam boat at 5 o'clock p.m.  and arrived at 9 p.m.    We remained on board for the night and in  the morning started and travelled 35 miles to Westown. In  this place and the district around we tarried until the 8th  of June preaching and labouring with the people ar    On the last day of May after taking breakfast  with Mr Elston I took a walk with Elder Ball into the    State of New Jersey    It was a beautiful serene morning and we  had a pleasent walk indeed. At the school house as we  passed sat a youth with his mind occupied with study 
 From Salt Creek Fort on the morning of the 26th we started  rode to Summit and thence to Pason where we took breakfast. We then  continued to Palmyira but did not stop so I did not get the statistics of  the place. At Springville we dined and then continued to Provo  where we tarried but a few minutes and thence we drove to Pleasant  Grove and took supper. Thence to Lake City where we did not  ^stop^ and on through Lehi and then to the point of the mountain where  we camped, making the distance of our day's travel 55 miles.    Pleasant Grove in 1855.    Pleasant Grove was 80 rods square with a wall the same. The  wall was 8 feet high built of stone three feet thick at the bottom and  18 inches at the top. It was finished 4 feet high. The  place contained 60 families with three hundred persons. There  was one adobie school house 18 by 30 feet and 60 dwellings erected    Lake City    contained seventy five families and 375 persons.    Lehi in 1855    At this date the city of Lehi was surrounded with a wall  120 rods square which formed the limits of the place. The  wall was designed to be 12 feet high 6 feet thick at the bottom  and three feet at the top: It was finished to the height of five  feet. Lehi contained 640 persons 3 schools 75 scholars and  a tithing office 33 by 24 feet and two stories high.    Next day was Sunday the 27th. The camp  was called at 3 o'clock in the morning. Arropene with his  band had been camped upon the bank of Jordan for a day or two 
 understand. Therefore we could not enter into the Kingdom of God    It is nothing but the power of God that has preserved this   settlement. The Indians could have killed every man woman and child here and   not a man had a gun ready to defend himself    When you have become of one heart and mind God has treasures   for you and he has given us capacity to see if we will magnify our calling   with everything we have to do in our lives. We are approaching very swiftly   the time when Jesus will come to see if we are of one heart and mind which the   Prophet Joseph said would be in this generation and will manifest himself to the   Saints and take up his abode with them. This was said twenty one years   ago and in 26 years more if we are not prepared to meet Jesus and angels we   shall be wiped out and sent to hell. We are fast approaching the time.    I do not care what was done in the morning of creation   or the days of Noah. I want to know what this people will do. Will   you be Saints and live your religion and magnify your calling in the   Church[?]    I will now tell this people what they should do. I will   tell the Bishop in the presence of the people what to do. Bishop I tell   you, go and start this wall and build it 6 feet thick and 12 or 14 feet   high; Shut up every gate except two and then you can lie down   in safety and an enemy cannot come upon you. If this is not the   will of the Lord, I do know it is my will and you should not   question any farther. God wants it done and I want it done and dont   stop until you are secured and that is enough.    Your stacks have been so placed that one Indian   could fire all this place and others shoot you down while you are fighting   the fire    What if the people in Jackson Co. had been good and been   sacrificing? What would have been the situation of the people. Why   the liars and goats would have had their heads cut off but the wheat and   tares had to be transplanted together in the wilderness. It was not   the acts of Joseph that cassed the removal of this people. It is the   people that govern and control which is the democracy of heaven. 
 preparing to take the place of his parents in the rising  generation. This brought fresh to mind the days of my  youth. We next passed the farmhouse the dairy of which  was so large that it required a horse mill to churn the  butter. The horse was upon the wheel churning as we  passed along. After walking a distance in the State we  took a by path and struck up a high hill. The road  was strewed with a great variety of flowers. The top of  the hill was soon reached where we had a beautiful  view of the surrounding country. Setting ourselves  under the shade of a chesnut tree and took a survey of  the distant fields of grain which presented a pleasent  prospect and while the birds sung their melodious notes  we bowed our head ^knees^ in prayer to the Author of every  blessing.    This was the first time I was ever in the  State of New Jersey and this makes the seventeenth State  in which I have been.    It was a year ago this morning that I left  Kirtland in company of Elder Hale to go to the Islands of  the Sea. The Lord had prospered and in grateful remem-  brance of this we blessed his name.    After being refreshed by the breeze I drew  my pen and wrote in my Journal the items here recorded  We then returned to Westown much invigourated by  our morning's walk and after dinner walked to Westown  and appointed a meeting.    Service was anounced to commence at  early candle light. It was expected that we should be  disturbed by two drunken doctors leading a company of  men with drums fifes and other instruments. But they  attended the meeting in silence and I preached to the  people from ##Jeremiah 31:22|Jer. 31 ch 22 v## and Elder Ball followed.    I left for Farmington on the 8th   of June and brother Ball took steam boat for New York  Both were homeward bound.    After several days of fatiguing travel with  an interval of one for rest I arrived at my father's  house on the 12th 
 waiting to have an interview with the Governor and as we began to  leave the ground at the break of day they descovered our camp  moving and set up a hoop for us to stop. Brother Huntington the  Interpreter waited until they came up and they enquired if we were  mad (angry). The Interpreter answered no, and that the  Governor had presents for them for giving up the murderers of  Gunnison but it was Sunday and he wished to reach the city to  attend meeting    We left the point of the mountain and drove  to Great Salt Lake City a distance of 25 miles by 9 o'clock  Thus we had made a journey to Cedar City via Sanpete and back  a distance of 600 miles in less than three weeks    I found my family well on my return  I received letters from my brother-in-law Ilus and many  books and papers from Dr J M Bernhisal by the Eastern  mail.    Nearly all the wheat crops and other vegitables  where^ere^ eaten b ^up^ by the grasshopers throughout the Territory  as far as we went; and most of the crops and vegitables in the gardens  of Great Salt Lake were destroyed    On our arrival in the city we seperated to  our several homes and attended meeting in the Tabneracle  in the afternoon and found the place full. J. M Grant  Heber C. Kimball and Brigham Young spoke and the Spirit  of the Lord rested upon the people    After they had closed Arro^w^pene the chief  who had been appointed in Walker's place arose and asked the  privilege of speaking and President Young introduced him to  the people.    Arropwpene addresses the Congregation. 
 The democracy of earth is division; and mark it: there will be a division here before   long among this people.    Now if you will all do right and live a holy life angels will come   and visit us and stay with us all night and you will have many revelations and   be happy. We know we ought to pray and would not neglect it if we   loved the Lord.    You may do just as you have a mind to when I am gone but   I beg and beseach of you to do right. I want you to build a strong wall   and be safe so that what ever comes along you may be secure; and bar your   gates and be careful and dont let the devil reign in you and all will be right.   God bless you and I bless you. Let us be of one heart and mind in the   things that we do comprehend and then we shall be one in things we   shall hereafter know    Remarks By President Kimball.    It is not my place to get up to reveal anything for it is the head   to convey it to the body; but it is for me to carry out his designs   and do his will; for when I do the will of President Young I do the   will of God and no man can get salvation unless he keeps his counsel   It is his will that the city should be walled and fortified and that is   my will. When I do just as he tells me I do the will of my   father in heaven for he is the only man who holds the keys of salvation.  When I feel reluctant to do his will I feel bad and so do you all   When I do his will I can sleep in peace and my heart is consoled   all the day long. This is also the case with you when you   do as the Bishop tells you. Last year your improvements   were all scattered about but now you are got into a smashed   suckertash pie. Now go to and save yourselves against all selfishness   I am going to put my property and all my wives into the Church—  and then nothing can be taken out of the Church. I am going   to dedicate all I have to God    When a man turns away from the Priesthood 
 As I drew near my native place I meditated upon  home and youthful days. Ariving I found my father stepmother  sister Eunice and uncle Ozem whom I had baptized a year  before. We spent a season in conversation took supper and  bowed our knees together around the family alter of a father's  house. I took an evening's walk with Eunice and found her  mind searching for light and truth.    I spent nearly a month in my parental home  and around in my native district where I laboured with  my relatives and friends to establish a Branch of the Church  and bring them into the Covenant.    Here I will close this chapter and begin a new  one for the classification of important incidents in a  prominant place that followed in ^quick^ succession at about this  date of my history.    CHAPTER XIII.    Baptism of my Relatives. Organization of a Branch  of the Church in Farmington consisting of my Father  Step-mother, Sister, Uncle, Aunts, Cousins and one other.    My First born. Letter from Thomas B Marsh.  My call to the Quorum of the Twelve. My journey to  Far West. Death of my Brother Asahel. Dangerous  illness of my wife Phebe.    My father Aphek Woodruff had at times  for many years been seeking religion and the favour  of God; and for more than 20 years a numerous circle  of friends had made his case a subject of prayer and  pled with the Lord in his behalf. But as often as  my father had struggled for victory Satan had hindered  him and gained the victory ^mastery^. 
 The Indian Chief made a short but spirited address which was  interpreted by brother Huntington. The purport of his address was an  exhortation to the people to give heed to the counsel of President Young  If they would do this and keep the Spirit of the Lord he said they   would not be sick and die as the wicked do but they would be healthy  The Lord is giving you great blessings in food and rament oxen cows  and horses and you should be faithful and thankful.    At the prayer circle I heard several interesting  letters read from our missionaries; one from Joseph F. Smith from  the Sandwich Islands and others from Joseph A Young Wm Kimball  and George M. Grant from England    Funeral of Judge Shaver    On the 30th of June the funeral of Judge Shaver Chief  Justice of United States Supreme Court of Utah was with  great honour and respect shown him by the citizens and Saints    July the 4th was celebrated with great display  by the citizens of Great Salt Lake City. The account of  it is given in the Deseret News date July 11th.    On the 11th I left the city in company   of George A Smith and Samuel Richards to go to Provo to  hold a three days meeting with the Presidency and Twelve    Conference at Provo  July 13th    The Conference opened at Provo in the morning and the people  were addressed by President Young in the forepart of the day  and he was followed by Heber C Kimball; in the afternoon  J M Grant and Samuel Richards    Conference continued next day and also   on the following which was Sunday the 15th. Many 
 he forfeits everything even his life for that is no longer his. My body is   only lent to me by the Lord and I forfeit everything when I go astray. If   righteousness was laid to the line it would take many heads from their shoulders   and the day will be when that will be done.    Now do as the Bishop tells you and not go to Salt   Lake to President Young to alter this or that. Pray that this people   may do right for when you dishonor the Priesthood you dishonor God. I   have been told that some have said I will honor the Priesthood but I will not   honor hism that holds the Priesthood; but I say you cannot honor one   without honoring the other    Bishop Walker is presiding here. Follow his counsel and   all will be right and the blessing of God will rest upon you. Even so. Amen    Benedition by Wilford Woodruff. We rode to Provo and spent   the night. Next day which was Sunday the people assembled in the meeting   house in two rooms. Wilford Woodruff addressed the people in one room   and was followed by President Young whose sermon I reported. H. C.   Kimball spoke to the people in the other room and T. Bullock reported   In the afternoon Joseph Young spoke and was followed by H C Kimball   and I reported and in the next room President Young addressed the   people and Thomas Bullock reported.    On Monday we rode to Springville and held   meetings with the people. President Young preached and myself and   T. Bullock reported and in the evening Joseph Young Parley P. Pratt and   Wilford Woodruff addressed the people.    Next day we rode a few miles and nooned. President   Young with some others went to appoint a location for a fort and we   then continued to Pason where President Young preached; and here   He got some oxen also in the settlements to take to Walker—the Indian   chief and he counselled the people in all the settlements to feed the   Indians and treat them kindly    On the following day we rode 15 miles and nooned   and here we organized. D. H. Wells was commander-in-chief   Robert Burton captain of Guard, Wilford Woodruff historian P. P. Pratt 
 Since I had became a member of the Church of  Latter-day Saints and entered into the New and Everlasting  Covenant with a Dispensation of the Gospel committed  unto me I had felt a deeper interest than ever in  the salvation of my father. I had now come to  declare a message unto him and his household and to  teach them words whereby they might be saved.    I began to cry unto the Lord for my  father and family and the Lord showed me in a  night vision that a great victory was nigh.    But the Devil fell upon the whole household  with great wrath and temptation. Some of the time  one was ready to fall back and then another and  his power also rested upon me as if to devour me  but after being confined to my bed for several hours  under his grasp in the name of Jesus I with my  friends burst the powers of darkness.    I went and stood before the people and  preached the Gospel and the Lord gave us the victory  and the time had come for the fulfilment of that part  relating to relatives ^my family^ obeying the Gospel spoken in my Patriarchal  Blessing under the hands of the Patriarch Joseph.    I then assembled them upon the bank of  Farmington river and led six of my friends into the  waters of baptism. They were my Father Mother my Sister  Eunice Aunt Anna Cossett & cousin Seth and Mr Dwight Webster a  Methodist Class leader. The following was written at the time  in a special page of my journal to ma[r]k this important  event in the history of myself and family:    "Great & Marvelous are thy Works O Lord  "(Written upon what came to pass on the first  "day of July 1838 in fulfilment of Revelation)    "O God inspire my pen while I record this scene of  "thy mercy and fulfilment of the blessing promised me  "by the testimony of Jesus Christ. Could I claim by  "faith all things are possible Even as by faith I have  brought by the power of God my friends and kindred 
 of the Lamanites or Indians were present.    President Young preached upon the subject  of the Lamanites and told the Latter day Saints plainly their  duty towards them.    An Indian Chief called High for^e^head  followed President Young and spoke in a very interesting manner  Others also preached during the day    At the close of the afternoon's meeting  President Snow at the close of the afternoon's meeting  nominated his two Counsellors. Dominicus Carter was  his first Counsellor: all the people did not vote together but  2 voted against him. There was a strange Spirit in  Provo and many had not the Spirit of God.    We reached home on the 16th.    On the 24 and 25 of July I attended the Polosophical  Society in the Social Hall and heard till midnight the  most thrilling speeches essays addresses songs music &c that  I ever heard. It was truly interesting to enjoy such  a feast of the intellect of the city. We was also addressed  on Saturday evening at the Universal Scientific Society  on the subject of Phrenology ^by [blank] followed^ by Orson Pratt ^and W. Woodruff^    On Saturday August the 4th  The Universal Scientific society met in the Music Hall  and heard an interesting lecture from Professor Orson Pratt  upon his descovery of the law governing the planetary  rotation.    At the prayer circle on Sunday the 5th  several missionaries were chosen to go to Texas and some  German Swiss and Norwegan Elders to go to those of their  several nations in the States    In conversing upon various principles  President Young thought none would inherit this earth when 
 and John Taylor Chaplains; Edward Hunter Chief Bishop and Doctor   Sprague surgeon and physician    We rode to Nephi City and spent the night and   held meeting; President Young addressed the people and I reported it    Interview with Walker the Indian Chief    Next day which was Tuesday the 11th we rode to Chicken Creek  and stoped and spent the night near Walker and his band. I    President Young and his Council tried to have   a talk with Walker. At first he appeared dogish and was not  disposed to talk. When we first formed our corrall within 40   rods of his camp he gathered all his warriors and made quite a display   but we did not go out to meet them at the time and they turned their   horses out and went into their tents.    When we called upon Walker he laid down   in the dirt and did not feel disposed to talk; but Brother   Young manifested great patience with him even after the patience   of most men would have been exhausted. He went to him and   lifted him out of the dirt and finally got him to talk some. The   following is a Synopsis of the conversation with Walker    He said he had no spirit. He had no heart. Did   not feel as though he could talk. "And when I heard that President   Young was coming I felt that I had no heart. I do not want to   talk. I want to hear President Young talk and then sit still   and hear others talk.    President Young gave him some tobacoco. he   said when he had plenty of tobacco than all his friends would   come in and smoke with him but when he was out of tobacco   they would not come to see him    Governor Young said I have brought some beef   cattle for you. I want one killed so that you can have 
 into the New Covenant with me. Without shame I have declared  the Gospel to them. They felt that God had sent me and that  they must obey.    The day had come. From my father's house I  and my friends started to the appointed place, bending our way towards the  river to attend to the sacred ordinance of baptism. The spot  was reached! We stood upon the river's bank! Nature spread her  fields of pleasing green and the Sun shed forth his golden  rays to gladden the earth while the silver stream was rolling  at my feet and seemed to say I am ready for the Master's  service.    With feelings better imagined than described  I dwelt upon the scene and cast my eyes upon the audience  while we sung praises to the God of Israel    Who would not have bowed the knee  while offering the sacrifice of the heart and imploring the  blessing of Heaven that the Spirit might pervade the waters  and rest upon the candidates?    As from our knees we arose I entered  the watery element and asked who was ashamed of the bed  where Jesus lay. Many eyes were turned to behold the  scene as my father followed me into the water and deep  solemnity rested upon their countenances.    I took my father by the hand while he  covenanted to walk with God; and for the remission of his sins  I baptized him. Feeling the victory won, my mother followed  his footsteps.    Eunice my sister my only sister was ready. The  garb of pride had been rent and now fearless of the world's despising  she next entered the waters of baptism and thus followed her  Divine Master.    For the consolation of Israel Aunt Anna had  long looked and now she rejoiced that she could the ancient path  persue while upon her example and upon the holy scene her  young daughters gazed and seemed to say O Lord prepare us likewise  to do thy will.    Seth in his early youth was not too young to  serve his God and he desired to follow the example of his  father mother and brother whom I baptized a year before. 
 it became celestialized and translated into the presence of God excepting  those who would be crowned as Gods and be able to endure the fulness  of the presence of God excepting that they might take with them some  servants for whom they would be held responsible. All others would  have to inherit another kingdom even that kingdom agreeing to the laws  which they had kept. Yet he thought these also would have the  privilege of proving themselves worthy and advancing to a celestial glory  but it would be a slow process.    I attended the Universal Scientific Society at  the Social Hall. Brother Frederick Mitchel addressed the Assembly  and was followed by David Candalme^land^. Brother Mitchel's address  on Utah as she was is and is to be was an excellent one. Orson  Pratt addressed us on the Saturday evening upon the organization  of worlds.    On the second Sunday ^the 19th^ from this Orson Pratt preached  upon the origin and organization of our plurality system    Parley P. Pratt arrived from his mission ^from  California^ on the night previous which was Saturday the 18th  of August and he made some remarks in the Tabernacle on the Sunday  to the assembled Saints.    September the 1st I attended the Universal   Scientific Society at night and after a short address from myself  Parley P. Pratt delivered a lecture much to our edifycation.    ^On the 13th^ I^i^n the evening we met at the Social Hall in  the capacity of a Pomological society: we had a full house. The subject  of raising fruit was warmly discussed and the formation of horticultral  society was recommended and a committee appointed to draft a  constitution and by laws for the said society.    On the 18th the committee met at 7 oclock in the  evening at the Library Room to draft the constitution and by laws  for the Horticultral Society. The committee present were  Wilford Woodruff President and J. C. Little William Staines 
 a feast while we are here    Walker wanted to have the Mormons sing before the parties   took a smoke. He said E. T. Benson came and his heart was good   but D. Huntington came and his heart was running    We then sung and when we had this was done Walker   again spoke and said I have not got the Spirit of the Lord and if   there is any one here that can give me the Spirit of the Lord I wish   they would do it. He said white people in heaven were happy.    Tulpidge next spoke amid much crying and tears   He was the Indian who had his wife-squaw killed. He said D. Huntington   had been good to him and he had not seen him since his child died. He   said they had not got good hearts and the Mormons' hearts were now   good who were here. We have now good peace and can all lie down   in peace without fear and I want to live in friendship with this people    We left the Indian Camp and returned to our waggons   But President Young had another talk with Walker this day. I was   not present and Thomas Bullock reported    On the following day we again visited Walker at   his tent. He was still in the same unpleasant mood and   did not wish to talk and he left his tent and went into the   willows, and others talked. The Indians had a sick child and   they wished the Elders to lay hands up it. Then President Kimball Benson  and Wells laid hands upon it and administered to it. Dr Sprague  also left some medicine for it and for others who were sick    The Indian said if the child died he should   have to kill an Indian child or a Mormon child to go with it. (This   is their tradition). The interpreter told him he must not do it—that   it was wrong; that when Mormon children died we did not   kill any child to go with them and they must not do it for   it was not right. The Indian said his heart was not   so. He wanted to kill some one to go with him. He said   he wanted his child to get well and then he would go with us 
 Uncles Ozem Hannah his wife and his son John were baptized  June 12 [18]37 Dwight Webster was not a relation by blood but as  he desired baptism at my hands I administered the  ordinance and he became a brother in Christ.    To be permitted to stand in one's own  native land to declare the Gospel of the last Dispensation  [deudding] the word by the power of the Priesthood to his  countrymen townsmen and kinsfolk and then to lead into  the waters of baptism Father mother sister uncle aunts  and cousins that they might receive at my hand the ordinance  of the house of God was to me an event and the  scene of this day was full of interest."    We returned from the river's bank to my  father's house where I confirmed those whom I had  baptized and organized them into a branch named  the Farmington Branch of the Church of Latter Day Saints.  The bread and wine being blessed we partook of it in  remembrance of him who had died for us. I also  ordained Dwight Webster to the office of Priest.    Those who composed the Farmington Branch  at its organization were as follows    Father, Aphek Woodruff;  Step-Mother, Azubah Woodruff;  Sister, Eunice Woodruff;  Uncle, Ozem Woodruff;  Aunt, Hannah Woodruff;  Cousin, John Woodruff;  Cousin, Seth Woodruff;  Aunt, Anna Cossett;  Priest, Dwight Webster.    The next day brother Webster returned to his  friends and aunt Anna and her daughters Betsey and Anna  left ^my^ father's house for their own home. I bid them  God speed and blessed them in the fervour of the Spirit.    I enjoyed a plesant walk with sister Eunice  at the setting of the Sun. We walked upon the canal and 
 Edward Hunter Samuel W. Richards O. H. Oliphant and L. D Young  Vice Presidents. We formed a constitution and bye laws    On the 20th at the Social Hall in a public  meeting of the Horticultural Society our constitution and bye laws  were unanimously adopted upon their reading and a sample of fruit  from the best Orchards of the city was exhibited and then distributed  to the Assembly. We adjourned till the 27th.    On Sunday the 23rd George A Smith preached  a very interesting discourse upon the History of the rise and progress  of Mahometanism and he was followed by Parley P. Pratt: both  sermons are published    The Horticultral Society met per adjournment  Speeches were made about the^ree^ bushels of choice peaches distributed  to the assembly and 20 new members enrolled.

 but he did not want to go till his child was well. He said Walker   was a great chief and President Young was a great chief and that wahat   he said was true and that he could not say anything wrong    Petetnet spoke and said they would be good and   not kill anybody mand not steal and that one could go alone and not   be killed and that there would be not blood in their path    Walker wished President Young to write a letter so   that he could show it to the people and let them know that we   were at peace so that there would be no difficulties with the people   President Young wrote one and Dr Sprague gave medicine to the   sick child and gave Walker directions how to deal with it and with   the others who were sick.    On parting with Walker and his tent he said   we now understood each other. That they were now to have all peace   so all could go on the road in peace and not be afraid; they   could not put in wheat and corn and one alone without somebody   killing them. He now wanted to have the road clear without   any blood in it. He wished for peace all the time.   President Young and Walker shook hands and then all the   company shook hands and the pipe of peace was smoked    Walker received his presents and killed a beef   for the Indians to have a feast. They also traded,—swaped   blankets for horses and bought two children who were prisoners    After we had made peace and got through   trading We left Walker's camp and rode to the Severe   Walker Gruspephene Squash-head with many others went with us   and we spent the night at the Severe. We made a raft   and crossed all our waggons over in one hour and 30 minutes   I spent all my leasure moments daily with Thomas Bullock   in keeping a history of the journey    Next day we reached Filmore City   a distance of 35 miles from the Severe and we had hail and   rain storms all day. 
 and viewed the river and pleasant fields and partook of some buries  by the way side. This was my last walk with my sister at  this ^time^ for on the morrow I left Farmington for my wife's father's    After evening prayers father retired to rest and I  spent a season in conversation with mother. We felt sensibly the  weight of the powers of temptation that try the souls of men  but out of which the Lord delivers his Saints. I also spent  a short time with sister Eunice before retiring and we mingled  our sympathies tears and prayers together before a throne  of grace.    I arose in the morning refreshed by sleep and  after once more partaking of the bounties of earth around the  family and bowing before the Lord and offering up our  morning sacrifice I took the parting hand of my father  mother and sister Eunice and once more bid adieu to my  native place.    I arrived in Boston on the 5th and took  the steam boat Portland at 7 p.m. and started for the city  of Portland. In the morning we saw a Spanish flag of  distress at sea. We approached her and found her to be ^the  wreck of^ a Spanish brig. They had been wrecked about 10 days  but all the crew was on board and no lives lost. We  towed her into Portland.    We arrived at 8 a.m. and after taking  breakfast with my brother-in-law Ezra Carter I visited  some book stores and purchased an Album for Mrs  Woodruff.    I then walked to Scarborough and had  the pleasure of again greeting my wife and friends in  peace and prosperity.    Some days after this I received an  interesting letter from Elder Jonathan Hale in which  he stated that Joseph was in Missouri and receiving  the word of the Lord daily    Birth of a Daughter  Sarah Emma Woodruff  July 14th 1838. 
 shadows flee," President Young delivered a very powerful and appropriate  prayer touching the Kingdom and work of God throughout the earth. It is  published in the Deseret News.    President Young preached in the morning and was followed  by President Kimball; and in the afternoon Elder Nathaniel V Jones from  the Presidency of the Hindostan and Burman empire mission related  his travels in those lands. He said that the Elders of the Church had  travelled from the Himalaya Mountains to near the Southern limits of the   Peninsula and that a Mr Wilson Episcopalian Bishop of Calcutta wrote  to the clergy in all the military cantonments to forbid the Elders preaching  there and the clergy faithfully obeyed their Bishop    Orson Pratt next day occupied the afternoon in addressing  the immense congregation upon the Divine Authenticity of the Latter-day Work  the Book of Mormon and the inspiration of Joseph Smith. Parley P.  Pratt preached in the morning upon the literal fulfilment of prophecy    On the 3rd and last day of the Conference the  authorities of the Church were sustained: Brigham Young as the  President of the Church and Prophet Seer and Revelator Heber  C Kimball as his First Counsellor and Prophet Seer and Revelator  and Jedediah M. Grant as Second Counselor    Orson Hyde President of the Quorum of the Twelve  Apostles Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt Wilford Woodruff John Taylor  George A. Smith Amasa Lyman Ezra T.

 The following day was Sunday and we held meeting at Filmore  Parley P. Pratt addressed the people and was followed by President Young   Wilford Woodruff reported and the reports were transcribed by Thomas Bullock   and are now in the Historian's office    In the afternoon and evening there were meetings   at which John Taylor Heber C. Kimball Wilford Woodruff and E. T. Benson   preached but their remarks were not reported.    Next day we travelled 33 miles to coal creek. During   the evening Walker the Indian Chief D. Huntington Brigham Young   and myself went into the hill among the Ceders and through a spy glass   viewed the country around. I also went on to the ceder heights   with T. Bullock and Phineas Young and viewed the country. We   had prayers together    Phineas Young said that he was ^the first^ chosen in the   organization of the first quorum of the Twelve Apostles but brother   Joseph said he wished I would let Wm Smith have that place so I   gave way to him. This is not true    On our next day's journey we met brother Enoch   Reese from California who gave us all the news up till the date   he left.    We camped for the night on Bever Creek. I caught a   fine trout and gave it to President Young; but he said he   would not take it unless I came and took breakfast with him   which I agreed to do    We reached Parowan next evening and the   Presidency and company divided among the people and during   the evening the Presidency and Twelve and authorities of the place   held a council while John Taylor preached to the people in   the Tabernacle below while we were in the upper room. The   minutes of the council were reported by Wilford Woodruff and   Thomas Bullock and are in the Historian's Office    Next day in company with John F Steel

The Lamanites. President Young's Prophecy.    At the Prayer Circle President Young prophesied that the Lamanites  would not conquer their enemies nor get much advantage over them  in their battles but they would continue to be destroyed and distressed  until they sought unto the Lord and his servants and embraced  the Gospel and became a righteous people. Then they would begin  to prosper but not before.    On the 15 in the evening Parley P. Pratt  Wilford Woodruff George A Smith and Erastus Snow of the Twelve  and also Joseph Young ^Lorenzo D Young H. S. Eldridge and Jacob Gates,^ met at the house of Parley P. Pratt to organize the  Territory of Utah into missionary Districts and to appoint the  missionaries to their various fields of labour. The following  were the divisions of the Territory:    Six Divisions: Utah County 1st  Juab Sanpete and Millard Countyies 2nd Iron and Washington  Counties 3rd Davis Co 4th Weber County 5th Salt Lake and   Tooele Counties the 6th District 
 Mrs Woodruff at an early hour this morning was  called to pass that stage of providence in a woman's life.  After praying with her and laying hands upon her imploring  the mercy of God in her behalf she was speedily blessed  with the birth of a fine daughter. She was born at  half past 5 o'clock in the morning    My wife continued to be favoured and I  remained with her until the 30th a portion of the time  engaged in manual labour.    On this day I started for the Islands again and  arrived there on the 7th of August. Here on the 9th  I was presented with the following letter from President  Thomas B. Marsh:    Called to the Twelve    (A copy of a letter written by Thomas B. Marsh to Wilford Woodruff)    Far West, July 14th 1838.    Elder Wilford Woodruff.    Sir,    A few days since President   Joseph Smith Jun and some others were assembled  to attend to some Church business when it was thought  proper to select those who were designed of the Lord to  fill the places of those of the Twelve who had fallen  away namely Wm. E. Mc Lellin Lyman E. Johnson  Luke Johnson and John F Bointon. The persons  selected were John E Page, John Taylor Wilford Woodruff  and Willard Richards.    On the following day five of the Twelve with  President Rigdon and some others met and resolved that  President Rigdon write to Brother Richards who is now in  England and inform him of his appointment and that  P. P. Pratt write to Orson Pratt and inform him that  the Lord has commanded that the Twelve assemble in  this place in this place as soon as possible and that  I should write to yourself. 
 and F T. Whitney I rode horseback to Cedar City 20 miles and on   our arrival I went to the Iron Works and examined all the premises   and saw several pigs of native iron. Erastus Snow explained to   me the difficulties they had to encounter in making iron which I   found to be many. We held a meeting in the ^evening^ President   Young preached and I reported his discourse. It is in the   Historian's Office    Next day again in company with brothers Steel   and Whitney I rode 6 miles to Summit Creek. The previous   Summer there were 12 houses here which were removed during   the Indian war but the fort was standing. From thence   we rode 6 miles farther to the Summit of the Great Basin and   then 7 miles farther to Battle Creek.    Here we had splendid mountain senery   of red rocks standing like pyramids 1000 feet high. Opposite   this cite was a fFort Harmony to be located 6 miles from the   base of the mountain on the East, the fort on the West. We   then rode to the present location of Fort Harmony which by the   rodeometer was 287 miles from Salt Lake City    This was a good grazing country and   splendid mountain Scenery. The brethren were trying   to take out the stream of water called Ash Creek to water   their farming land. They had carried it 6 miles and   had to carry it 62 miles farther to carry it on to their new   field which they were making. The missionaries who   were sent out the last Winter from Salt Lake had done  this. Rufus Allen was their captain. John D. Lee   had the charge of their old fort.    Fort Harmony was 15 miles from   the Rio Virgin    I went fishing but caught nothing though   it was said there were some small trout in the Creek 
 The missionaries were appointed to their respective Districts and  the Conferences arranged: Conference at Provo on the 26th of October for the  First District. In the Second District first quarterly Conference on the  3rd of November at Manti City. Third District Conference on the 9th  of Nov at Parowan. Fourth District Conference at Farmington on  the 20th of October Fifth; Conference at Ogden City on the 2nd Nov  Sixth District; 1st quarterly Conference 10th Nov. at Tooele City.    Wilford Woodruff was appointed to draft the minutes of   the meeting and present them to the Editor of the Deseret News. They  will be found in full in ^the^ No. for October 17th th.    About this date the Indians began to be hostile again  At the Elk Mountain Mission they had shot three of the brethren  namely Wiseman Hunt Wm Beahhnin ^Behannan^ and Edward Edw^ards^  and they had broken up the mission. They were als^o^ making  disturbances at Green River Mission    In company with Elder T. Kington I rode  to Farmington Davis County to attend the quarterly Conference  of that District to commence on the 20th    After retiring to bed I prayed to the Lord  to show me what we should teach the people and I received  for an answer, "Let my servants obtain the Holy Ghost and keep  my Spirit with them and that will instruct them what to teach  the people continually. Instruct the people to keep my Spirit  with them and they will be enabled to understand the word of the  Lord when it is taught them    Quarterly Conference    At Farmington  October the 20th 1855.    Saturday morning at 10 o'clock the people in the 1st District 
 Know then Brother Woodruff by this that you are appointed  to fill the place of one of the Twelve Apostles and that it is  agreeable to the word of the Lord given very lately that you should  come speedily to Far West and on the 26th of April next to take  your leave of the Saints here and depart for other climes across  the mighty deep!    Yours in the love of God  Thomas B. Marsh.    Wilford Woodruff.    Notwithstanding the threats of the people to mob tar  feather and kill me if I came there again I was determined  to visit once more the Saints upon the Islands of the Sea  The next few days was occuppied in carrying out this design  I also had a short interview with Mr Douglass the Methodist  Priest and his countenance indicated the wrath of his heart    On the 13th of August I gave my last farewel  to the Islands and started for my father-in-law's where  I arrived on the 20th.    The last day of summer I rode in company  with Mrs Woodruff and sister Rhoda F Scamman to the  beach on the sea shore. We spent an hour riding upon  this beautiful beach extending along the shore for about seven  miles in length and one hundred rods in wedth at low  water. It is composed of fine white sand, is almost a dead  level and very easy and pleasent to ride or walk upon.    The sun shone brilliantly upon the face of  nature the canvas of the gallant ships were filled with the  morning breeze as they sailed upon the great deep; wave  after wave reached the extent of their bounds upon the shore  and then rolled back to their source again. These together  with other varieties made the morning's excursion very pleasent.    After picking up a quantity of sea shells to carry  to the land of Zion for domestic uses and in memory of  the place we returned to Mr Scamman's and after visiting  others of the brethren we reached Father Carter's having been  during the day a distance of 20 miles. 
 I then went on to the top of the Kanyon through which runs Ash Creek.   Thomas Bullock and Samuel Atwood were with me. In about 2 hours   we rolled into the Kanyon about 1000 feet below about 50 tons of   rock. We rolled off one which would weigh about 5 tons. It fell   about 200 feet and struck a shaft of rock and took it with it and   falling into the Creek 800 feet below sent a sheet of water about fifty   feet into the air. We made a good deal of thunder for awhile   After wearying ourselves of this we returned to the fort    On our return we found the people assembled   in meeting. President Young had spoken and also Parley P. Pratt   neither of which I heard. President Kimball was speaking when   I came in and Lorenzo Young followed and the Spirit of God   was upon him and he prophesied many things    There was no report of any part of the meeting   only T. D. Brown's minutes of President Young's speech which he   gave me and it is with our reports in the Historian's Office  Thomas Bullock and myself reported all the President's sermons   when we were present as we were appointed Historian and   clerk of the Camp.    Next day we rode back on the bench on our   return home 3 miles and the company stoped and President Young   located the new fort groungd to be called Fort Harmony   Thomas Bullock took an account of it in his Journal. The   location was good and there was a great quantity of grass and   good soil. We rode to the Creek and nooned and thence   to Cedear City    About 20 miles south of the Rio Virgin ^Fort Harmony^   we descend rapidly a long distance into another climate on the   Rio Virgin. There was a kind of fruit there covering  thousands of acres which was very choice. Its flavor was   between a strawbury and cranbury. William C. Stains  had some of it growing in his garden 
 assembled in quarterly Conference at Farmington. There were  present of the Twelve Apostles Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt  and Wilford Woodruff; and of other missionaries Lorenzo D Young  Gilbert Clements T. D. Brown and Richard Cook    All the missionaries present had a cold  and a sore throat and they were all hoarse. It had come  on during the last 24 hours and it was a complaint that was  quite general among the people. Many hundreds men women  and children were atctact^k^ed in the same way. There was   no change in the weather nor anything on the outward appearance  of the elements to cause this general complaint    Elder Parley P. Pratt was quite unwell  He said he had not intended to preach this forenoon; but  he had to preach or go to bed. So he delivered a very   interesting discourse to the Conference for the space of  two hours and a half upon the birth life death and  resurrection of Jesus Christ. He took for his text  the ##Luke 2:10-11|10th and 11th verses of the II Chapter of St Luke##  "And the angel said unto them fear not for behold I  bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be  unto all people for unto you is born this day in the  city of David a Saviour which is Christ the Lord."    Parley P. Pratt in opening his discourse  gave some practical lessens upon the training of our children  in the history and knowledge of the Bible. He said  that one cause why he had taken that text was that a school  teacher in Great Salt Lake City had asked her whole school  where Jesus was born and not one of them could tell her. He  observed however that the children were small; but he urged  upon the Saints the importance of instructing even the smallest  children capable of understanding the history of the Prophets and   Apostles. He said by way of illustr[a]tion that every 
 September came and I soon began daily to make  preperations to leave the State of Main and our friends  and relatives in Scarborough to lead a company of Saints  from the Islands of the sea to the land of Zion in  Far West. My wife and child were to accompany me    It was the greatest trial Phebe ever had to  pass through, to take the parting hand of her parents  kindred and neighbours perhaps for the last time and  to go a journey of two thousand miles late in the fall  with our baby in the first stage of the [w]hooping cough  Add to this also that she was to leave a kind father's  house of plenty and go to a new country and settle  among strangers    These matters dwelt upon my wife's mind  and the persuasion of friends was also against her journey  under the trying circumstances. In fact it seemed at  times as though earth and hell were combined to crush  her troubled spirit and the sequel of our journey will  show that all this was like foreshadowings of that which  followed on our way    I cryied unto the Lord that she might  be supported under these and all other trials and I  soon found that the same Spirit which had  inspired her to embrace the fulness of the Gospel  and forsake her friends to go a journey of one thousand  miles to enjoy the society of the Saints—the spirit which  had also united her heart and hand to me and led  her to accompany me to the Islands of the sea was  with her still!    Yes Phebe possessed too much firmness and  faith and confidence in God to put her hand to  the plough and then look back or to wholy give  way to trials however great. Like Ruth she was  determined to forsake kindred and country for my sake  and the cause in which we are engaged    As I beheld the spirit in her daily walk—  rooted in her heart and beaming in her countenance  my whole soul was bound to her in love stronger than  death such as we only feel in such circumstances. 
 A Ceder City Next day ^which^ was Sunday. E. T. Benson and Parley P. Pratt   preached and I reported and afterwards we rode to Parowan and held   meeting with the Saints there in the Council House. President   Young preached and I reported it    We left Parowan next day on our return to   Great Salt Lake City.    We were at Salt Creek on the 26th and held   meeting as we had also at other places on the way and at night I attended   the trial of Bishop Haywood which lasted till midnight. T. Bullock  and Wilford Woodruff reported and our reports are in the Historians   Office    We started in the morning from Salt Creek and rode   West across the mountains and made a new road. After 20   miles travel we nooned at the Fort at the foot of the mountain   The mountain was quite steep and stoneny over which we had come   and we nooned in sight of Utah Lake. In the afternoon   we drove to the bottom of the mountain beside the Utah Lake   on the West side and camped for the night. We had twenty five   men from Nephi City with us to help us make a road.    May 30th we left Lehi and drove to   Unionville where we made a short hault. Bishop Richards had   prepared a good dinner for us but the company did not wish   to stop so near home: So President Young told them to eat   what they wanted and give the rest to the poor    We then rode on to Great Salt Lake   City having travelled in 26 days 594 miles being 287 to   Harmony and the same back    On the 10th of June I rode to Fort Herriman   with Mrs Woodruff Emma and Bulah and soon after our arrival  George A. Smith and E. T. Benson came. We none   of us had ever visited the place before. I thought   this the last location in the Territory for a herd ground 
 child in these valleys knew at 8 years of age that it was necessary  that it should be baptized at that period of its life, because it had  been taught it by their parents and others. But, he said, was it not  for the name of Jesus Christ all our ordinances and administrations  would be of non effect and therefore our children should be thoroughly  taught concerning Jesus and his history.    In the afternoon Gilbert Clements preached  and in the evening T. D Brown.    On the Sunday Orson Pratt delivered an able  discourse upon the coming of Christ and read a revelation, from  the ##Doctrine and Covenants 49:22-23|Doctrine and Covenants##, given through Joseph the Prophet to  Parley P. Pratt and others:    "Jesus Christ will not come in the form of  a woman, nor like a man walking upon the face of the earth  but look forth for the heavens to be shaken and the mountains  to be laid low &c"    Orson Pratt after reading this revelation to  us then spoke of the work to be done previous to the coming  of Christ; also the first delivery of the Priesthood to Joseph Smith  by the Angel John the Baptist, the building up of the New  Jerusalem the Angels flying through the midst of the heavens  and the sounding of the trumpets as spoken of by John the  Revelator and the great day of the Lord's coming.    I have recorded a synopsis of this Discourse in my  Journal.    In the evening Elder Wilford Woodruff addressed  the congregation. Among other things he said:    "I am truly thankful that I have a mission  appointed me and in connection with Parley Pratt and Orson  Pratt two of the Twelve Apostles for it is the first time since  the organization of this Church and quorum that I have had  this privilege of being associated together with these two men 
 The devil had never tempted me to cease from doing  the will of God in not gathering to Zion or to cease travelling  and preaching the Gospel. I was therefore not inclined to stay  and enjoy the Society of my friends and kindred for in staying  I should have both ruined them and myself as touching the  Kingdom of God.    Father and mother Carter and all my wife's brothers  and sisters had been uncommonly attentive and generous to  us during a year past but they could not see the propriety  of our gathering with the Saints. But we dared not let  this be an hinderance and I could only pray to God that  they might be brought to understanding and not lose their  reward for their great kindness to us.    I spent the 12th at Father Carter's packing  up the last remnants of our goods and on the next day  Phebe's father gave us one hundred dollars for which  sum we both signed a document to the effect that we  were satisfied and would hold no further claim to  any of his real estate or personal propety    About this time my mind was in suspence  because the camp of Saints did not arrive from the  Islands and I had not heard anything by letter from  them for some time past. The sickness of our babe also  was an anxiety to us    On the 18 and 21st I received letters. In  the latter brother Thomas informed me that the camp  would be ready to start in a few days. He wished me  to pray God to deliver them and enable them to go out  of Babylon. Truly it was a day of trial all round to  those who were seeking to go up unto Zion.    Several days afterwards I saw a report in  the Portland Transcript against the Mormons in Davis  Co. Mo. which grew out of the fact that our brethren  claimed their privilege as American citizens and cast their  votes at an election. Numbers were rising up among the  Gentiles in the different counties to go over to Davis Co  and mob the Saints. All these reports had a tendency  to dampen the minds of those who were about to start  for the bosom of the Church. But none of these matters 
 The following day was Sunday and George A Smith E. T. Benson   and myself preached to the people upon the subject of walling in their city   and schooling their children; and at the close of the meeting we returned to   Great Salt Lake City    On the next day President Young gave a party at the   Social Hall to the company who went South with him and it continued   till midnight    On the 14th we had a hard rain storm and a great deal   of heavy hail fell. One child was drowned and another nearly killed   A cloud broke and the water came down in torrents. It washed away   much of the city wall and much damage was done to houses and   gardens. On little Cottonwood the hail cut everything down   Gardens corn and wheat were destroyed. It was also the same   at North Cottonwood. Nearly all the glass was broken out   of the windows    With Mrs Woodruff and most of my family the   next day I drove my waggon to South Weber Fort and we spent   the night at brother Kington's with whom I spent the following   day and preached to the people upon the subject of walling in   their city and educating their children; and to the sisters I spoke   about forming a female society to make clothing to clothe   the Indian woman and children    Returning to Great Salt Lake City next day   we nooned at brother Ezra Clark's and I saw his carriage (top   and sides) was cut to pieces with the hail. Hail there fell   as large as a small hen's egg. We rode through one hail   drift two feet deep washed by the water down the creek    On the Sunday Orson Spencer and Orson   Hyde preached in the forenoon and in the afternoon   Elder Thomas Bullock gave an account of his mission to the   Shushonees    On the Monday President Young and company 
 on a preaching mission only as we have met in Conferences from  time to time to transact business as a quorum"    I returned home and spent the week. A  Quarterly Conference was held at Provo on the 27th and 28th by  Parley P. and Orson Pratt and others    In company with Parley and Orson Pratt on the  1st of November I rode to South Weber and we did not  arrive till a late hour. It was very dark. We got lost  in the bluffs and came very near running our carriage off a  steep bluff. I went to the fort got a pilot and lantern  and we arrived in safety. The people were assembled  for a meeting. I spoke to them for a short time and  spent the night with Orson Pratt at brother Kington's.    Next day we rode to Ogden City and met  with the people in the capacity of a quarterly Conference.    We had a strong wind through the day  and night. It was the strongest gale we ever experienced  in these valleys. Much damage was done and many  adobie houses were blown down some unrofofed fences laid  prosterate carriages and waggons mashed to pieces hay and   straw stacks blown over and many chimneys blown off    Next morning the people were gloomy in  consequence of the destruction by the wind which also continued  strong through that day and until the next which was Sunday    I reported all the discourses of the Elders  at the Ogden Conference. I left Parley Pratt preaching in  the afternoon of Sunday and rode to South Weber where I  preached in the evening to the people    In company with Joseph Young Horace  Eldridge and Henry Herriman I rode to Tooele City to  hold conference. There were others of the missionaries  attening this Conference which continued several days 
 started to explore and make a road through Touille and around   the West Mountain    I spent the following week in the Historian's   Office with George A Smith and T. Bullock in drawing off the   sermons and teachings of the Presidency and Twelve    Anniversary of the Death  of  Joseph and Hyrum Smith  June the 27, 1854    Ten years ago this day Joseph and Hyrum Smith was ^were^ martyred   in Carthage jail; and on this day the Church held a special   Conference in Great Salt Lake City according to the adjournment   at the General April Conference    The Conference opened at 10 o'clock and there were   present the Presidency the Twelve the various quorums of the Church and   a large congregation.    In the morning President Young preached one of   the most interesting discourses and in the afternoon Elder John Taylor   gave an interesting and very minute description of the martyrdom   of Joseph and Hyrum and all the circumstances leading to that   solemn event in our history.    Conference continued during the next day   and President Heber C. Kimball delivered a long address.    The following persons received missions abroad:  John Taylor of the Twelve to New York and with him N. H. Felt   A Robins R Clinton M. H. Peck and Abel Lamb; John Young   to the U. S.; Leman Brown to Michigan; Preston Thomas   to Texas Elder Tripp to the same place; Elder White to Ohio   and Joseph Cregg to Ireland.    A very important nomination was also made 
 moved me in my determination    The next day this article in the paper went  the rounds of the time among our friends and neighbours  They said it would not do for us to go ^and^ for that we should  be killed &c if we did go    These fears formed no part of my trials  yet at no part of my time since I had joined the Church  was I subject to more care and suspence than now.  Yet I was never stronger in the faith.    But the case stood with me thus: The  Lord had commanded me to go to Zion spedily and while  I was setting myself about the undertaking the Devil and  his agents were using their combined extertions to hinder  me. I had been waiting for the Saints from the  Islands of the sea to accompany them until it was  very late in the season; the fFall rains were upon us  and cold weather would soon set in and the minds of  the Saints around me were cast down and depressed  We had a dreary journey of two thousand miles before  us with no other prospect than to camp upon the cold  and damp ground. I had also a sick infant of only  two months old to take with me and my wife whose  spirits at times felt severly the circumstances around us;  and when she suffered I suffered also. But thank God  she stood the trial like a brave woman    These were some of the things that made me  anxious at the time but I was determined to make the  journey before another Spring even if it was alone and on  foot and I had to b[u]y my bread by the way.    On the 28th I received a letter from brother  Nathaniel Thomas in Camden in which he said "We are  almost ready, and shall start to-morrow morning." This  cheered us.    Some days, however, passed before they arrived  and on the 3rd of October Elder Townsend started to look after  them and see why they did not get along.    On the next day at 2 p.m. our anxiety was  releived for the camp came in sight and I immediately  accompanied them to Sister Foss' house where a busy scene ensued. 
 On the Sunday during this Conference the missionaries  met at 8 o'clock A.M. and passed resolutions concerning other quarterly  Conferences in the District    I returned to Great Salt Lake City and on the 17th  again left with Orson and Parley Pratt to attend a quarterly Conference  at the city of Bloomfield; and thus the missionaries continued from  place to place holding Conferences throughout the Territory    On the 27th of November the mail brought us news from   the last of the fall of Sebastopol    On the 29th I attended a Missionary party got  up by the Presidency of the Church. They made a feast and invited  all the missionaries in the place. There were about 70 men with their  wives. They danced till eleven o'clock; took supper during the time  at 7 o'clock and they were addressed during the evening by Presidents Grant  and the quorum of the Twelve. President Young was sick and President  Kimball was also unwell so that neither were in attendance though they  made the feast    Death of Orson Spencer.    I heard during the evening of the death of Elder Orson Spencer  Many friends mourn his loss. He was a firm pillar in the  Church and Kingdom of God    Sunday December the 2nd Brother Hugh Findly  in the morning gave an account of his travels [blank space]  and the customs of the people.    On the 3rd I started for Filmore to attend the  Legislature. I took passage with brother Loran Farr. We were  4 in number—L Farr Lorenzo Snow J. C Wright and W. Woodruff  We reached Lehi that night and held meeting. I preached and  was followed by Orson Pratt and E. T. Benson. Parley P. Pratt  was kicked by a mule and could not attend meeting 
 by President Young in filling up the Church organization.    John Smith Eldest Son of Hyrum Appointed Patriarch  June the 28, 1854    His great uncle John Smith father of George A. Smith who was the   Third Presiding Patriarch of the Church was now dead and this day John   Smith eldest son of Hyrum was appointed to the office first held by   his grandfather Joseph Smith Sen. next by his father and then   by his great uncle John Smith. Hyrum Smith's eldest son was   the Fourth Presiding Patriarch who had succeeded to that office since the   organization of the Church April 6, 1830.    Conference closed on the 28th after addresses from J. M. Grant   Lorenzo Snow John Taylor Orson Hyde W W. Phelps and President Young.    The Fourth of July was spent in celebrating the day   of Indipendance and an account of it is contained in the Deseret News   of that time    The Twenty Fourth of July    The celebration of the arrival of the Pioneers into the Valley of the   Great Salt Lake was kept by the citizens with the greatest   display ever got up by this people up to that date. The proceedings   are published in the Deseret News of July 27th.    Sunday August the 27th Orson Pratt Arriveded from   his Eastern Mission    While the Presidency and Twelve were holding   their prayer circle Elder Orson Pratt came into the room with us   long enough for us to shake his hand. He had walked some 30 miles 
 We immediately commenced nailing and painting the  wagon covers and preparing them against stormy weather. I discovered  that the company needed a leader. I laboured with them until  night and then returned to Father Carter's. It was an affecting time  to Phebe as she was about to part from all her relatives.    We spent most of the ^next^ day in painting and preparing  our waggons for the journey.    At about 2 o'clock p.m. we bid our friends and relatives  farewell. Many tears were shed; but Mrs Woodruff manifested great  fortitude in parting from her father mother family and friends  After our farewell to these and many of the neighbours who  were present I made a commencement to lead this camp  of Saints on their long journey.    Our company consisted of the following persons:  From South Fox Island brother Charles Brown and family;  from North Fox Island Nathaniel Thomas and family;  brother Ephraim Luce and family, Cyrus Sterrett and  family, Ebenezer Carver and family and a young man by  the name of Alonzo Thurstin; from Camden Daniel Whitley  and family; from Scarborough Elder James Townsend and  family and I with my wife and child.    The whole numbered 53 persons. We had with  us ten waggons and nineteen horses.    After being set in order we travelled 13 miles  to Kenebunk and camped for the night by a saw mill and  as we were not fully organized there was some bustle amongst  us at first.    It was for a moment a trial to my feelings  to take my wife with an infant at her breast into a cold  tent to sleep upon the ground; but after we had become  reconciled to it there was an invitation given her to spend  the night at a house which was accepted.    I laid down upon the bed I spread in the tent  and after two hours I got up to stand on guard. I sat up  the remainder of the night built a fire and by its light wrote  in my journal.    On the third day we arrived at brother Holmes'  and spent the next day, Sunday, there when we fully orgainized  our company and I was chosen their leader. Milton Holmes 
 We reached Filmore the capitol of the Territory on  the 7th of December    On the Sunday at the City Hall Parley P. Pratt  preached. He gave an account of his travels through this country  in the dead of Winter in deep snows to Iron County before there  was any settlement; and then he took up the comming forth  of the Book of Mormon. I met in council with the Presidency  and Twelve on the welfare of the Territory    The Legislative Assembly    Its first Session at Filmore  December the 10th 1855    On this day the Legislative Assembly met for the first  time in the State House at Filmore. Both hHouses  organized and adjourned    Next day I met with the Council at  one o'clock and at 2 o'clock we met in joint session. The  Governor appeared and delivered his Message. One  thousand copies of it was ordered to be printed and it  was resolved that one hundred copies of the Minutes of each  day should be printed for the benefit of the two houses  The Secretary Almon W. Babbit arose and insulted the  Assembly to a great degree by threatening that their bills  should not be paid if they printed that number, and  he wished to dictate to the Assembly what they should  do which was out of his province    The Governor arose and gave  the Sectretary a severe lashing with his tongue and said  he ought to be kicked out of the house as a poor miserable  dog. 
 that day. We were all glad to meet with him; but he was too   weary to stay long with us.    Sunday the 3rd of September Orson Pratt spoke   to the people upon his mission to the States; and on the following Sunday   he spoke upon the Law of Consecration; and on the Sunday after   President Young preached upon the Law of Consecration    In our Prayer Circle on Sunday the 17th the   subject came up in conversation concerning Orson Pratt publishing   the "Seer" and the doctrines in it    President Young said brother Orson ought not to   have published the marriage ceremony. It was sacred and one  of the last ceremonies attended to in the endowments and ought not to   have been given to the world    Brother Pratt said he thought it was no harm as   the plurality of wives and its doctrines were to be published to the world   and he should not have done it had he thought there had been the   least harm in it.    President Young said he was satisfied that brother   Pratt intended no wrong in it. He also said that the doctrine   taught in the Seer that God had arrived at that state where he could   not advance any farther in knowledge power and glory was a false   doctrine and that there never will be a time to all eternity when   all the Gods of eternity will ceacse to advance in power knowledge   experience and glory for if this was the case eternity would cease   to be and the glory of God would come to an end. Celestial beings   will continue to advance in knowledge and power worlds without end   Joseph would always be ahead of us. We should never catch up   with him in all eternity nor he with his leaders.    Brother Pratt also thought that Adam was   made out of the dust of the earth and he could not believe that Adam  was our God and the Father of Jesus Christ    President Young said that he was and that he 
 was to accompany us and he was appointed our Com    On the next day we continued our journey travelled  15 miles and camped in a beautiful medow    Fill up the interval from October 9 to Nov 2  with the journey and casualities of camp life including  a severe attack of something like the colera upon myself  and the sickness of several children one of whom afterwards  died.    At this date our company began to seperate  Elder M. Holmes took steam boat at Buffalo for Fairport  and after another day's travel brother Cyrus Sterrett and  his family and brother Wahitley and family returned to the  city of Buffalo to spend the winter as the expence was  so great it was thought we could not all get to Zion. So  they stoped to labour and brother Thomas let them have  a span of horses and a waggon to help them up in  the Spring.    Here it should be observed that in the very  starting of this company Nathaniel Thomas had cheerfully  steped forward to the assistance of the poor and invested  about 1000 dollars for waggons horses tents &c to fit out  this company while others who possessed this world's goods  also, drew back and did not go with the poor lest they  should be under the necessity of assisting.    Journing onward to the 143th and we  were at Painsville where the Saints had been much persecuted  From this place the next day brother Townsend walked  to Kirtland to see brother Milton Holmes    We rested on the 15th on account of rain  but journeyed to Mantauway on the following day and  spent the night at the Inn of Lewis Turner. Elders Holmes  and Townsend were with us again but Milton had made  up his mind not to go any further with us but to tarry  in Kirtland or in the regions around until the Spring    While at Kirtland brother Holmes had seen  several letters from Far West representing that there was  great trouble among the Saints caused by the inhabitants of  Missouri coming against them with armed force.    Next day, we left brother M. Holmes and 
 Babbit followed and said he had as good a right to occupy  the Governor's seat as the Governor himself and made use of much  insulting language.    The Assembly then resolved that the freedom of the  house should be withheld from Secretary Almon W. Babbit. The  Secretary threatened to take all the money and return to Salt Lake City  and pay no more expences of the Legislature. He was under  the influence of liquor    Babbit started for the city next morning. He  felt better however and did not take away the funds belonging to  the Legislature as he threatedned. I sent letters by him to my  wife son Wilford and daughter Phebe.    The Legislature continued its sessions    Synopsis  of  A Discourse Delivered by President Brigham Young  In Filmore  Sunday December the 16th 1855.    His test [text] was    "Arise and shine O Zion for thy light is come  and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee." [##Isaiah 60:1##]    I have always felt since I have been  called to preach to speak of the practical things of every day  life instead of some great mysteries along way ahead in  eternity which the people do not know and never will as the  things taught do not exist.    I felt in the beginning of my ministry  that I had no right to preach unless I was filled with the  Spirit of revelation and prophecy as the ancients; and I  feel the same to-day 
 came from another world and made this brought Eve with him partook of the   fruits of the earth begat children and they were earthly and had ^mortal^ bodies   and if we were faithful we should become Gods as he was. President   Young told brother Pratt to lay asside his philosophical reasoning and   get revelation from God to govern him and enlighten his mind more   and it would be a great blessing to him. He also told him to lay   aside his books and go into the Kanyons as some of the rest of us   and it would be better for him; and he said that Brother Pratt's   philosophy injured him in a measure.    The President made many more remarks worthy   of note. He said that we all should grow up in revelation so that   principle would govern every act of our lives. He had never found   any difficulty in leading the people since Joseph's death    General Conference   of   The Church held in the Tabernacle G. S. L. City  Oct 6th 1854.    The Presidency were present and of the Twelve Apostles Orson   Hyde Parley P. ^Orson^ Pratt Wilford Woodruff George A. Smith   E. T. Benson and Lorenzo Snow. The rest of the quorums   of the Church was present as usual.    [blank space] 
 continued our journey without any particular incident for the interval  of three days at which date we were brought to another seperation    On the 20th we made arrangements to further devide  our little company, as brothers Thomas and Townsend w[ere] inclined  to stop by the way and winter    Our company was truly getting very small there being now  only brothers Luce Brown and myself and our families to continue  our way together but we felt united in spirit and determined  to go onward    That night we had a comfortable room at a Inn 7 miles  from Worster. We were by ourselves for the night; and while sitting  by the fire side Sister Lydia Luce related a dream that she  had on the night before. It was as follows:    She saw a small sun in the South and while  looking at the strange phenomenon there appeared a ring of blood  in the West. There also appeared directly several other rings  of blood of a larger size all encircling each other, forming  a ring within a ring. Soon following this a ladder of fire was seen  blazing in the heavens and it fell to the earth and broke into  two peaces. One part of the ladder had an iron plate fastened  to the end of it with something also attached to it. She said  that in her dream I went and picked it up and read it  and it contained the ##Isaiah 15|XV. Chapter of Isaiah##. By reading  this chapter it will be seen that this ^is^ very typical of what  has to befall this Gentile nation in particular and the world  in general in the last days.    As we travelled along we were continually hearing  of the Mormon war as it was called and the inhabitants of  Missouri were persecuting and puting the Saints to death because  of their religion    On the 23rd Phebe was attacked with a severe  head ache which terminated in the brain fever. Still we  travelled on daily though my wife suffered much from the  journey.    The first day of winter was a pleasent one as  far as the season of the year was concerned; but O the winter  of sorrow was trying to seize upon my soul. Our company  was much afflicted.    It was December the first and as we journeyed 
 In order to be quallified to preach we should  be filled with revelation. I do not consider that any man  is qualified to preach the Gospel and sayings of the Prophets  unless he is filled with the Spirit of the Prophets    We are commanded to arise and shine  but for us to sit down and say we believe in this work, we  believe that Joseph was a Prophet and still not carry  out the work which we are commanded to do; not to build  up and beautify Zion we shall find that we shall miss  our aim, we shall not enter into the celestial Kingdom  we shall not enter through through the gates    We must show to the Lord that  we are willing to fulfil what he requires of us and this  we shall not do unless we are willing to arise and  shine. But how are we to do it? We have  got to build up Zion, we have got to make Zion  the most holy and polished refined and beautiful  place upon the face of the whole earth    Some may expect to see Zion  in all that beauty majesty and glory which God has  spoken of; but the people do not understand the things  of God. I will prophesy that unless this people will  arise and build up Zion as God has commanded them  they will be removed out of their place and another people  will be raised up in their stead who will perform the work  and this I will say in the name of God. I also say in  the name of the Lord that the descendants of Ephraim who  are among the Gentiles are the first born and they are the  first ones to receive the fulness of the Gospel in this  Dispensation; they are the first to be gathered together  and this work was not to be given to any other. In  the beginning of the Kingdom of God this has been done 
 [blank space]    I raised this year 369 bushels of wheat and 400   bushels of potatoes and 200 bushels of corn    My Mission to The Saints in the North    On the 27th of November I started on a mission to the Saints   in the North of the Territory    The first place I visited was Session's Settlement   but I did not preach to the people for they were holding Court   in the School house to settle a difficulty with a gGentile. Bishop   Stoker was the Bishiop of Sessions    Next day I was at Farmington and held a   good meeting with the people. They were making many   improvements. They had a Court House built and many   good buildings going up. Bishop Brownel presided over   Farmington.    On the following day I rode to Bishop Kay's  settlement and found the people doing ^well^ and on the next I   visited South Weber over which Elder Kington was Bishop  This was the last day of November    I was at North Weber Dec. 1st where   I preached to the people and and spent the night with Bishop   Abiah Wadsworth who presided there 
 we passed brother Thomas by the wayside mending his wagon  that had broken down. Brother Townsend was quite sick.    I had not passed this afflicted company but a few  miles before I was called to stop my horses for the purpose to  all appearence to allow my wife—my companion to breathe her  last and resign her spirit into the hands of the God who  gave it. I stoped the wagon in the street where to  those around it seemed that her death couch stood. But  while two of our sisters were standing by her side to  witness the scene of her last moments the Lord was very  merciful for notwithstanding that it seemed that breath  had left her body and her spirit departed she revived  again. I then drove the horses a few rods further and  put up at an Inn in Eaton    Here I stayed the night taking care of Phebe  and the babe. Earnestly did I pray the Lord to  spare the life of my wife.    The next day was Sunday December 2nd  It was absolutely necessary to discontinue our journey and  I concluded that for awhile we would tarry until Phebe had  recovered her health in some degree or departed this life    This settled and the next part was to  remove from the In for our circumstance would not permit  our remaining there. I therefore carried her into the wagon  and drove two miles to the house of Mr McKenzie  and put up not knowing how long we should have to  tarry for Phebe felt as though she only had a breath  of life remaining.    During the day brother Thomas and his  little afflicted company passed us again. The child  whom I have already mentioned who died on the road  was a daughter of brother Thomas. Elder Townsend  who was travelling with him was now also sick.    After getting my wife and things into the  house and my horse put out I devoted myself to the taking  care of my wife.    In the evening she called me to her bedside  and said that she felt as though a few moments more  would end her existence in this life 
 The Ephraimites are before me tohere to day. Now if I  was ^were^ to ask you if you are willing to do as you are told you would say  "Yes." But let me tell you there is not one of you who is  willing to do as you are told.    I have given the people counsel for years pass  how to build their forts walls cities houses and to begin to beautify  and adorn Zion; but have the people done as I have told them  in these things. You may say these are of minor consequences  but let me tell you that if you are not willing to do the small  things that are necessary on earth then you are not willing   to do as you are told in heaven and you will lose your  glory and exaltation    Now do you not remember that I told   you years ago to go to and build up a beautiful city in  this place but there has been but little done towards it. We  have many who have been in the Church for quite a  number of years and yet we have not a builder or architect  who knows enough to build the meanest house not even  a kitchen in the New Jerusalem. Then how can  we build up the New Jerusalem? I have told the  people all the day long to be prepared to build up this  city; and I will say that if we could take all the knowledge  that exist among every nation upon the face of the whole  earth and boil it down into an essence and put it all into  one man he would not know enough to lay the first stone ^in the  wall^ around the New Jerusalem to say nothing about building  the city and Temple    We have got to improve continually and  build up good cities and adorn and beautify Zion and  let me tell you that if you do not come to that  place where you will not set your heart on any  riches or gold you are not worthy to do the work of 
 On the 2nd I was at Ogdan. This was the first time   I had ever visited the place. I found it a large settlement. I preached   to the people principally upon the tithing the Poor Fund the establishing   of schools and building their wall    On the Sunday I was at Bingham's Fort. I preached   in the morning and dined with Bishop Bingham. I found this to be   a flourishing place and well calculated for a city. The farming   land was good and abundant. The population at the time was   one hundred families. Much wheat was raised but I did not   learn the amount. The Bishop only had 30 bushels of tithing   wheat and 15 tons of hay: the remainder was in the hands of   the people. They had two schools ready to commence   their fort walls were 110 rods long ^and the fort 64 rods wide^. Three quarters of it was in   the process of erection. A part of "Little Soldier's" band of Indians   were distributed among the people to support and learn to work   They did not like it and seemed very mad and some were leaving   their wickeups and going to Weber river. Bingham fort is three   miles from Ogdon.    I left this fort and rode to Ogdon Hole and preached   in the eveing to a full house. Thomas Dunn was Bishop   Ogdon Hole was one of the most flourishing settlements North   of Salt Lake City. Their soil was very rich and the water   abundant. There were 47 families and a school of fifty   scholars. Their Fort was laid out 140 rods long and 74 wide to be   surrounded with a wall which was to be built of stone 4 feet   thick and ten feet high and laid in mortar. Much of the stone   was on the ground but not yet laid up. They had raised   there sixteen thousand bushels of wheat. The Bishop had in   hand six hundred bushels of tithing wheat and two tons of hay   They had also 13 head of tithing cattle. The wall of the   city was commenced    On the 4th I was at Willow Creek. There 
 She manifested great confidence in the cause she had embraced  and also exhorted us to confidence in God and to keep his commandments.  To appearence she was dying but as on the day before she again revived  I prayed with her and laid hands upon her and commended unto  our Father in Heaven. She slept some during the night.    Two days after Phebe was still very feeble and low  and I returned to Eaton to get some necessaries for her. I also felt the  power of the Destroyer resting upon in the forepart of the day    In the evening Phebe for the first time during  her sickness began to lay hold on faith for her recovery. Her  confidence grew strong and we laid hold on faith together; and  together we confessed our sins before the Lord and covenanted to  keep his commandments.    I had with me some oil that was consecrated  in Kirtland for my anointing. I again consecrated it for  the healing of the sick and bowed myself before the Lord  and prayed with my companion and anointed and laid  hands upon her in the name of Jesus Christ. Thanks be  to God our prayer was answered and the fever left her    Two days more and the voice of the Lord  was to us to arise and continue our way to Zion and  through the mercy of God Phebe was enabled to rise and  walk a little. She had been confined at this place four  days where we were treated kindly.    Five days farther on our journey and  where we put up at night we suddenly heard the sad news  of the death of my brother Asahel H. Woodruff who died at  Terre Haute Indiania on the 18th of October 1838 at 3 o'clock  in the morning.    In the paper was published an account of  the Administrator's sale of the property of my brother. It was  sold on the 4th of December for about three thousand dollars  Mr Robert A Smith was his administrator    There was also in the same paper an  account of the horrid butchery of 18 Latter-day Saints in Davis  County Missouri by a wicked mob    The next day I rode to Terrehaute Indiania  through the delightful scenery of that country and drove to what  was Ashahel H. Woodruff's book store. Instead of finding him there 
 God; and if this people will not build up Zion they will be  removed out of their place    Every time we build a house or a city  we should better it. Everything around us should be  neat and clean.    Now look at this building for a school-house  The ground around this building should be prepared for   a play ground and should be kept neat and clean and  be prepared so as to make the children happy. Children  should be in a clean place. But how is it here. The  moment the children step out of door they see nothing  but filth all the day long. The minds of our children  while young are pure and they should not spend their time  in filthy places for it affects their minds and feelings  They should be in a clean place for they are visited  by the angels of God; but parents do not realize this although  it is true    You may say I do not have time to keep  my dwellings school-houses door yards &c clean. No nor you   never will have till you die upon the same principle but you  should take time. Now it should not take a week till  I would clean out my door yard; but the people in this city  have not had time to clean out their door yards or to make  anything else that they ought to do    I will show you that I will set an  example for my children to follow    I will teach those things which we ought  to do to day. I have preached this doctrine from the  beginning. The first time I ever preached was to tell  the people their duties of to-day    Now if you had all the gold in the  world what would you do with it? Would you go to 
 were 35 families at this place and Charles Hubbard was its   Bishop. Their Fort was laid out half a mile long 70 rods   wide with a wall to be built around it, 70 rods of which was then 6 feet high   They had raised 12,000 bushels of wheat. They were very   deficient in Schools and had not but 3 months good schooling   for three years. The Bishop was very anxious to obtain   a good teacher    Next day I went to Box Elder and preached   in the evening at the School House. This place contained   60 families and brother Davis was their Bishop. The   majority of the people were mostly Welsh and Danish   and mostly poor. There was but little wheat raised   by them this year. The Bishop had on hand 20   tons of tithing hay and 15 bushels of wheat. They had   no school that Winter. Their fort wall was laid   out 200 rods long enclosing a fort 100 rods wide   The wall was to be built of stone 3 1/2 feet thick at the   bottom and 2 feet at the top and 8 feet high. It was   in the progress of erection    I returned revisited the settlements on my   way home and reached Great Salt Lake City December the 9th.    Next day was Sunday. Charles C Rich   addressed the assembly in the Tabernac[l]e and gave an account   of the rise and progress of the settlement of San Barnadino.    The Legislature of Utah.    The Legislature of the Territory of Utah met on the morning   of December the 11th. The following were the members of the   Council.                 Heber C. Kimball     Orson Pratt      Daniel H Wells   Wilford Woodruff 
 he was in his grave and his store occupied by his Administrator  and clerk.    I had an interview with his clerk and made  enquiries concerning my brother's sickness and death but defered  attending to his business until the following day. It was  with difficulty that we could get entertainment in the city  for the night but finally we obtained an empty house.    The next day December 13th I spent mostly  in enquiring into and attending to the affairs of my brother  Asahel. I learnt from Messrs Smith and Ray that he  died at 3 o'clock on the morning of the 18th of October and  that he was sick ten days and deprived of his reason  four days before his death. While in this state his  mind in its wanderings was principally upon his business  but he occasionally spoke of his friends. His disease was  the congestive fever on the brain.    They farther said that his mind for  several months previous to his death had seemed to them  occupied by some matters unknown to them. They was not  so well acquainted with the secret of this as I was for  I was corresponding with him and knew by his letters  that his mind was deeply interested upon the subject of the  Gospel and the Church of Latter-day Saints    Of his character they testified that he  was moral in his life temperate in his practises beloved  and honoured as a citizen and his loss deeply felt    Asahel was indeed a young man of very  excellent talents, firm and indipendent in mind and also  indipendent and liberal in his principals    I had not been privileged with an interview  with him for about seven years but we had corresponded  with each other by letter. He had a peculiar art in  letter-writing which gave much interest to all the productions  of his pen. Both of us had long anticipated much upon  our meeting but my hopes were thus suddenly blighted but  I said the will of the Lord be done: All is right!    His entire stock of books with his personal  property was sold but his private letters journals manuscripts  account books pocket watch penknife pencil letter stamp bosom pin 
 California? No but go to and build up Zion. You may say there  is no California here; we have no gold. But it is not gold that is  going to build up Zion though we shall use a good deal of it, but  we have to do it with our hands.    You can make a beginning and do something  You can set an example. You can clean out your house and yard  and make that clean and you can stop the bed bugs from running  around you.    I do not see the first fruit or shade tree in this  city. Come up to the Salt Lake City and get some fruit-  trees and set out and have some fruit growing    Now this is Zion and the light has come  and is shining upon you and you are called upon to build  up Zion. How? By going to California? No; for  there are millions of gold here and the Lord will send it into  sight when he thinks it is best for us to have it as he did in  California.    If you think it is not best to come here go  back to Missouri. Old Father Harris said that he would  stay at Kanesville so that when the Church got ready  to go back to Jackson County he would have but a short way  to go to what the people here would. Brother George A  Smith told him he might happen to find it much the  nearest way there by way of the Rocky Mountains and   many will find that to be the case. The longest way  round will be the shortest way there    We have been called get speculators  and misers. I have told the people I was the greatest  miser and speculator in the world; for I am laying  plans to try to obtain everything there is on earth and  in heaven that is good. That is what I am after  all the time. I have told the people I would possess

 heaven while they would become servants to the next world. My  speculations are not confined to this world alone    Now I say go to and make a fine  house in this place. yYou may say I have not the capital  very well. Look at Salt Lake City. We have built   up that city without capital. That was built up with  the strength of our hands which is our capital    Now I want to ask the people here  what do you say to going out on to your lots to build your  houses and set out fruit trees? Your wall around this fort  is not much protection. You might as well stick up  a row of willows to scare and stop the Indians as anything  there is here.    Now go to and build up some good houses   in this place. I want to join some 16 of the brethren  to come and build up some houses and a wall around them  but I shall build humble here; I shall not build large  but I want you to launch out; and then come and see Salt  Lake City and if I have not beat you I will try again  I am determined to improve in all the buildings I do while  I live    If we get our Temple built I mean to go to  work and build another one as much better than the one  we are now building as this is better than the one that  we built in Kirtland; and this wing of the State House  here is a better building in its finish and structure than  that Temple was    Now go to and do what God requires of  you and whatever you want to get, get lawfully and then  it will be a blessing to you always and you will enjoy it  but steal it and it will be a curse to you and cause you  sorrow and misery. Whenever I get so that I set my 
 After organizing we waited upon the Governor by a   committee and he met with the two houses in joint sessoion and   delivered his message.    On Sunday the 17th J. M. Grant bore   testimony to the marvellous healing of the sick multitude at Montrose   by Joseph which I recorded at the time and which will be found in   my history of that date. Heber C. Kimball joined in the same   testimony.    After the close of the afternoon meeting I met with   the Presidency and Twelve in President Young's Office in the upper   room which was dedicated for prayer that day by us, the sick   prayed for and oil consecrated    In the evening I preached to a full house upon   the subject of education in the Seventeenth Ward    After spending the 19th in the Legislature I   delivered ^a lecture^ at night to some 60 young men who had assembled at the   Sixteenth Ward for the purpose of forming a Philosophical Society   I spoke upon the subject of education. They appointed a   Committee of five to draw up a Constitution and to appoint   a President.    An Affray Between The Soldiers and Citizens  on   Christmas Day    There was a great excitement through our city during the   forepart of the day. Some of the soldiers who were quartered   in the heart of the city became intoxicated and began to fight   among themselves and soon some of the citizens became mixed   with them. The soldiers fired upon the people and the people   fired stones upon them in return. Some were wounded on   both sides but none killed. The military officers drove the 
 heart upon houses lands gold or anything else on earth so as to begin to  turn my heart away from the Lord the day before that comes  I want the Lord to take me away    May God bless you: Amen.    Remarks by President Kimball    President Kimball followed and said:    I felt quite well in the forenoon but  I do not feel well this afternoon    I know what President Young has said is true  We have come here and we have dedicated this people and this  place to God.    Now do the people realize why we are here. No  they do not. We are here for the benefit of all Israel. We  have not come here for a salary. We have come here to do  the will of God and I will say that the yoke is off from our  necks, and it never shall be put on again, not on the necks  of this people; for if we do not do as the Lord wants us to do  he will raise up a people who will do it. I tell you that  God will smite any people who undertake to stop this work  and I say that what President Young has said is true    You know that our children have to  learn the Alphabet first. So it is with this people. The  things which God teaches us are small and simple in  many respects but they are just as necessary for us to  learn and practise as it is for the child to learn his  letters in order to understand the arts and sciences for  we have to learn and practise small things before we can  obtain and carry out the greater things of God    Now we are required to begin to build  up and adorn Zion. We should set out fruit trees 
 soldiers into the barracks and the Mayor and marshal of the city cleared   the streets of the citizens which ended the fray    On this Christmas day also I met with the inhabitants of the   Fourtheenth Ward and delivered an Address to the people Isaac Morley   Bishop Hoagland and others addressed them as well and then they were   dismissed for two hours when they came together again and spent   the afternoon and evening in festivities and the dance.    A Ball Given By Col. Steptoe and Judge Kinney    December the 26th    The Presidency and Twelve and many others were invited by these military   and civil representatives of the United States. It was a splendid   party and held at the City Hotel kept by Wilkie. We had a good   supper and a pleasant dance    On the evening of the 29th I attended the Polisophical   Assembly at the house of Lorenzo Snow and spent the evening in   a very agreeable manner. The time was spent in the performance   of music delivery of speeches reading of poems & singing of songs. The   room was beautifully decorated with flags and emblems of the   different arts and sciences. Variety was in the scene.    On the last day of the year I looked over my Journal   and found the following to be a synopsis of my doings of the past year    Synopsis Of 1854    Travels: I travelled eighteen hundred and eighty nine miles    Meetings: I attended 47 meetings    Discourses: I preached 44 discourses
