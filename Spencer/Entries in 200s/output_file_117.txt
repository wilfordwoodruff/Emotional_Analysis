Wells said  that orders had been sent North and south to watch for  the soldery and not let them come in but to destroy them the best way they could let grain be cashed in the mountains so they can get at it. President Young said that He thought it would  be best to secure the grain in the mountain it was said that Vannetting had 500 lb of powder coming and that He would go out  with cattle to bring it in or would do as He was told yes say President Young except a righteous course. President Young said I had  rather have a good powder horn and charger than any flask in the world He considered it safer. There is a deep feeling pervading  our city about the soldiers coming in to destrowy us as a people. I had an interview with President B. Young and  he gave me some important instructions with regard to  Historical Matters at 5 oclok I called upon Brother Carri ngton and went into his peach orchard and eat a fine rair ripe peach called Carringtons 1st Early it was a splen- did Peach, and is well worth cultivating.

He then began clothed with the spirit and power of God and the revelations of Jesus Christ He recounted  our persecutions and oppressions for the last 25 years and then took up the unjust Course of the United States against us at the present time then He told us and all the world what the will of God was  and what his intentions were He would no longer submit to their Ungodly persecutions If General Harney came here with an  armey to destroy this people we would destroy him and his armey they should not come into this territory or our cities to destroy this people the United States had turned mob and were breaking  the Constitution of the United States and we would now have to go forth and defend it and also the kingdom of God, and should  they undertake to send an army of 50000, or 100000 men next year we will lay waste this whole Territory and flee into the mountains   ENDENTRY Aug 16 1857 I will lay all my dwellings in Ashes. I will lay all my mills in ashes I will cut down evry green tree and shrub in the vallies of these mountains I will burn evry peace of timber wood and board in the vallies of the mountains then do you not think that our canyons will be adapted for the bones of our Enemies I think it will. O Israel can you  stand these things. The shout of Yes rent the air of the assembled  thousands. All you who are willing to follow me in these things raise your hands towards heavens there was a sea of hands up I have had to hold the Indians here for years from destroying  the emigrants I have had to give them many thousands of dollars to keep them from killing the Gentile Emigration to Calafornia the United States Government now ows me $50000 in my Official Capacity and they will not pay me a dime but are sending armies at great Expens to destroy me and this people. But I will  now inform them and all people that if they make war upon me I shall not attempt to restrain them any more but I shall let  them do as they please. The United states do not know what  they are doing. and the Merchants in this place do not know who they are they are selling the blood of this people for Gold. they were not going to bring any goods to this place but now that an army of 2500 men are coming here to destroy this people  they can bring a great amount of Goods let them take Heed to their ways. If the United states sends an Armey and a train of goods here I may get a part of the pay which they  owe me I now wish to say to all Gentiles send word to your friends  that they must stop crossing this continent to Calafornia for the indians will kill them for the Emigrants have shot down  the indians with out any cause or provocation and if the United States  make war upon me I shall not attemp to restrain them any longer I will give all people in this Territory that wish the  privilege to leave I want all to leave that are not willing to  follow me. If there is any of my family my wives that wish to leave I will send my teams and carry them whareever they wish to go if it is to Hell I will drive to the gate but will not let my teams go into hell but they must turn around and come back but those that wish can enter in. I want this people to go to  and save all their grain and prepare to cash it up in the mountains but dont let your Neighbor know whare you put it. I want  you to prepare for a 7 years siege. many other remarks were  made all taken by the reporters the spirit of God rested upon us  him and upon the congregation and all the saints felt to say amen to all President Young said.

He was followed by Br  Rogers who had been on a mission to the sandwich Ishands He  said but few words was followed By President Heber C  Kimball who was filled with the power of God spok quite  lengthy told the people to obey council and do right, go and glean all  the wheeat in the fields and save it their was 1000 bushels in this County that could be gleaned, if the people will do as they are  told they shall never be driven from these vallies an Enemy  shall not come in these vallies for we will not let them  if we have to take to our tents at all we will not pitch them  again as a resting place untill we Pitch them in Jackson County  He said that President Young said when He first came in in a  speech that we should lay up grain for a 7 years famine and we  should let the land rest on the 7th year Brother Woodruff  herd it. (Brother Woodruff said it was written) Now the US are trying to force a Govornor upon us we will not Receive  him the Lord has said our govornor will procede out of the midst  of us this is in the Bible Brother Woodruff turn to it.

He said to Brother Mathews when you get in  Calafornia the people will try to stop you and hedge you up so  that you cannot strengthen us you must be upon the  watch tower. The Nation is determined to make us free  they are determined to drive us to defend our selves and become  independant. The Nation is breaking to peases in spirit their  is no Union among them and before the United States get through  trying to destroy us they will want to let out the Job I told  the people years ago that if they would let us alone we would Convert  and revolutionize the world if they did not let us alone but undertake  take to break us up we should spread abroad the faster and do the  work so much the sooner and we will do it if this nation now  makes war upon us we will be free and build up the kingdom  of God the sooner. The people have tried all the time to destroy  us but they have failed all the time when the government called  for 500 of our men they had no idea that we would comply  with their request this plan was laid to destroy the saints and tomas  Benton then had orders in his pocket to destroy the Mormons  if they refused Jesus said the time would come when we should  sell our coat and buy a sword, that time has come and we have got  to go and deliver ourselves from our enemies and the Lord will  help us He will fight our battles and we will become an independant  kingdom. I feel well and I will tell you why if I am right  and I know I am and that is this people are now much  nearer their Fathers face than they ever were before they  are united and willing to do the will of God and this causes  me to rejoice. The people now fell to say it is the kingdom  of God or nothing it is not my farm or my house but the  kingdom of God this is the case with this people. Brother  Kimball said Old Buck was now free the yoke was off his  neck and it would not be upon his neck again. Many other  remarks were made but not written. There were present  B. Young H C. Kimball O Hyde W Woodruff  Ferrymore Little  President Young said that I am satisfied that the Post Master  in Calafornia was authorized to open our Mail and read  our Letters and retain what He pleased and send on what  He pleased I will insure that our Letters to the Elders on  the Isles of the Sea will be opened and read I pray the Lord  to reveal to those Brethren what our desire is that they  may come home.   President Young came into the Histor- ians office at 15 minuts to 2 oclok He sent for me I was  at home I immediately went to the office. Presidents  Young Wells and F D Richards was in the office. President Young said   ENDENTRY to me as I came in have you a team I told him I had  a pair of small Ponies. He asked If I could spare them I Hesitated a moment and said IYes sir, I can do any  thing that is wanted. He then said I have a good  pair of Horses that I want to let you have, as you are  labouring here I was taken quite surprised it came vary unexpeted to me. I excepted the Horses and was  thankful though perhaps I did not say it at the time  Brother Wells went and showed them to me I tok them home they were a fine large pair of sorrell Horses  they were offered 200 bushels of wheat for them  to day. President Young stayid 3 1/2 hours in compiling his History. He remarked that the revelation upon  a plurality of wives was given to Joseph Smith in 1831 He revealed  it to Oliver Cowdery alone upon the solem pledge that He would not  reveal it or act upon it it but He did act upon it in a secret manner  and that was the cause of his overthrow. President Young also said  that the United States are driving this people to war sooner than is for their good for we are civilizing the Indians and if they would  give us time we would give them a knowledge so that when they  do fight the Gentiles that they would have some Judgment and not  kill women and Children and those who ought tonot to be killed. There is  now many of the emigration on the way to Carson valley the Gentile  emigrants shoot the indians wharever they meet with them and the  Indians now retaliate and will kill innocent People. One woman who  had fitted out to kome here to investigate Mormonism she was  killed and all her teamsters and all these through the folly of Emigrants    ENDENTRY August 27, 1857 ~ Thursday   27th I spent the fore noon in the office the afternoon I watered my  garden and budded my peach orchard with Carringtons 2nd Early and his large yellow Peach and Apricott    ENDENTRY August 28, 1857 ~ Friday   28th I spent the forepart of the day in the House of the Lord giving  Endowments the evening I spent in the office   FIGURE The present signs of the times show that we as a people  as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and the  Kingdom of God are approaching the most important period and  Craices crisis that we have ever seen since the organization of the  Church, their is a solemnity and anxiety resting upon all Israel.  The Government of the United States have now entered the  field as our persecuters and are determined in their harts to destr- oy us from off the Earth as far as it is in their power  The President James Buch^a^nnan and the Congress of the Nation  containing 35000000 people have sent an Armey of men  of numbering some 3000 armed with all instruments of  death to destroy us as a people they are now marching towards  us upon the plains and one or two month from this date must  decide the case with us whether we have to go out to war and  meet in deadly combat this winter or not. The Gentiles are vary  wicked and the cup of the United States as a Nation is full and they  are enemies to God and his kingdom and people they are determined  in their hearts that God and his Christ shall have no kingdom on  the Earth and they are now about to make war upon his saints  the time is at the door that will try mens souls the Lord has   ENDENTRY Aug. 28th 1857 promised to fight the battles of his saints nevertheless the saints  will be tried whether they will abide in his covenant even  unto death whether we are willing to lay down our lives for  Christ sake, word has been sent out to call in the Elders from  abroad from among the Gentiles, and the gospel has begun to go to  the Lamanites and the Lord is about to remember his covenant  with that people, the Judgments of our God must now soon be  poured out upon the Gentile world and the children of Jacob and  the House of Israel must go forth and fulfill their destiny and help  build up Zion all nations are becomeing vary wicked may  the Lord give us grace according to our day and help us to stand  the test and prove in the hour of trial and temptation torue to our God, our  Brethren, and our covenants. And I ask the Lord in the Name of Jesus  Christ to Preserve the Presidency of this Church with the cities  people and Records of the Saints from the hands of wicked and  ungodly men. I pray that the Lord will preserve me for a  season that I may labour to assist in preserving and keeping  a record of this Church and kingdom and the dealings of God  with us and preserve me O Lord from dishonouring my calling  or priesthood but give me faith power and grace to pass through  what ever I may be called to meet. It appears as though  the whole world was about to make war upon the kingdom  of God. In years that are past and gone we have had towns  cities, counties and states with the Govornor and people against  us. Now the whole Nation has risen up against us, vary  well, let lightnings flash and thunders roll and Earth quake bellow  and let all hells dark Hosts gather in battle array against  God and his Christ against the Church and kingdom of our God against  Daniel and the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb  of God and all ther followers Let the Heathen rage and the people  imagin vain things let them take council to destroy the  Lords Anointed. Yet God will laugh at their calamity  and mock when their fear comes for their destruction shall come like a whirlwind even in an instant suddenly  it shall over take them like a woman in treval and their  shall be no power to deliver, and all the Judgments which God  the Lord, or Prophets Apostles or Holy men have said shall  come upon them shall be fulfilled upon their heads and not  one Jot or tittle shall fail. Rejoice O ye Heavens and be Glad  O Earth and all the righteous who dwell therein for the Lord  God Omnipitent reigneth and his will will be done in all  things for he holds the destiny of all men in his hands  the wicked as well as the righteous. Let the prayers of thy people  O God come up into thine Eares and let them be answered upon the  Head of the wicked and Let the blood of all thy Prophets O God  be avenged upon the Earth untill the wicked shall scease to reign  and untill the Earth shall be cleansed from all the abomination which now dwell upon it fulfill thy covenants O God which  thou hast made with Israel in the Last days and let the Gentiles  who dwell upon this land be spedily cut off inasmuch as they  will not repent. Send they Judgments O God into the Armies  of the United States who are coming against us to battle and let  them be destroyed that they shall have no power over thy saints  any more at all   ENDENTRY August 29, 1857 ~ Saturday   Aug 29th I spent the day in the office on the History    ENDENTRY August 30, 1857 ~ Sunday   30th Sunday I attended meeting at the Tabernacle all  day Levis Stewart first spoke a short time was followed  by Heber C Kimball and  Brigham Young they spoke much to our Edifycation in the Afternoon Orson Hyde, and President H C Kimball we had a good meeting all day.

Marsh then arose and addressed the  people for a short time warned the people not to Apostitize and look to him as an example of misery and one who had suffered the wrath  of God in consequence of Denying the faith he wished to be forgiven by them President Young put the vote to the Assemble if they would  receive him into full fellowship not withstanding all his heino- us sins all voted to a man to recieve him, then President Young Addressed the people and the meeting closed.   PM W. Woodruff spoke  to the people and bore testimony to what had been said by the presidency, was followed by President Wells   I attended the prayer Meeting in Presidents upper room we herd letters read from H. S. Eldridge and Bernhisel I presume  we shall not have any one in Congress next winter to present our memorials and interest (J.M.B. No I think not) I think it will make some of the People squirm when they hear that I am  taking the property which the Government has sent into this  Territory some of our Brethren going down to the states met about 60 of the Chians they were vary Friendly to them  the Indians stole 800 fat cattle and the rest was driven back  to the states so the Army has no cattle with them ownly for their present use some said that they believed that those  Indians who stole the cattle were half mormon and began to dam them Brother Murdock remarked we are all mormons here  in this company and I dont wish to hear my friends abused President Young said what will the people think in Europe when they come to hear that Brigham Young is at the Head of  the vigilance committies in Cansas Troubles  and that the Government of the United States could not remove  him untill the Lord see fit to let them. The world accuse me of controlling the affiairs of Calafornia and Kansas andc the people do believe that we have a Band called the Danites but how  could they exist so long without sheding Blood for we cannot  find that they have killed any body But I do not know of any  such men. I think that James Buchanan has got in a Bad fix he has got the yoke on his neck and has to carry it alone   ENDENTRY with no ox to carry the other End but He is pounding his own shins and will soon pound the shins of others for the moment He gave  consent to send an armey to destroy this people he placed himself  as the shedder of innocent Blood and the Judgments of God will  follow him. when war does break out between the north and south  it will be the most bloody. G A. Smith said that the ownly thing for the President of the United States to get out of his trouble ownly to  get a Bill through Congress to admit any territory as soon  as they had population Enough to organize a State Government  and to be received at once into the Government or Union with  equal privileges with the other States. President Young then said let me suggest a matter Brother salmon River now do we not want a station about half way from here say near fort Hall should we not send men say 20 to  make a station there it was thought best to do so. He said that the north is the place for us and not the south no one but the  saints would want the cold North country. This is the FIGURE of this Continent and I think we had better keep near the lock  and kepp the FIGURE in our own hand. If we send a company we  want to send them this fall so that we can put in grain  there this season   6th President Young came into the Thomas B  Marsh spent the fore noon with us helping about his history I spent most of the day oin the office    ENDENTRY September 7, 1857 ~ Monday   7th I budded some peach trees this morning I went to the office at 11 oclok and spent the remainder of the day in the office    ENDENTRY September 8, 1857 ~ Tuesday   8th I budded peach trees in the morning and spent most of the  day in the Van Vlvleeit arived this evening  in this Young in the evening    ENDENTRY September 9, 1857 ~ Wednesday   9th Capt Van vleeit met with the Govornor in the  social Hall at 9 oclok with the presidency and Twelve and some 100 citizens He presented Gov Young with a letter of Instructions or request which was read  before the assembly and but little said and a great deal thought. Capt van vleeit asked if there was lumber to be bought and grain and Hay andc president said that there was a plenty in the country. President Young asked  if there was any one present who could supply capt Van vleeit any lumber that He wanted Brother Samuel Snider arose and said that that He could supply 40000 feet  of Lumber. No other one said any thing President Young took had private conversation with the Captain in the afternoon President Young walked with Captain Van Vliet through his Garden and orchard and through Professor Carringt- ons the Capt Asked Mrs Carrington if she was willing to  cut down her fine peach orchard for her faith and Religin she said "yes and would set up nights to do it if it became necessary   ENDENTRY September 10, 1857 ~ Thursday   10th I went into the Big field with a Brother Thomas to set him to work ploughing my field for wheat. I spent  the afternoon in the G A Smith's History  read. President Stewart Van Vliet  through his house introduced him to his family andc    ENDENTRY September 11, 1857 ~ Friday   11th I spent this day in the Endowment House we gave 83 their endowment.    ENDENTRY September 12, 1857 ~ Saturday   12th We got in an express this morning saying that ther  was some 900 troops on the way this side of Laramie and some 12 government Baggage trains. Capt Van Vlieeit came into the Young had a good deal  of conversation with him. He said to him I do not  want to fight the United States but if they drive us to it we shall do the best we can and I will tell you as God lives that we shall come off conquerer for  we trust in God. For God has set up his kingdom on the Earth and it will never fall but it will stand we shall do all we can not to fight but if they drive  us to it God will overthrow them. if they would let  us alone and say to the mobs now you may go and kill the  Mormons if you can but we will have nothing to do with it  this is all we would ask of them But for the Government  of the United States to array their armies against us  it is to despicable and damnable for any honorable Nation and God will have them in derission for doing it. The Govern- ment has all the time endeavoured to destroy us in an under- handed manner. But Now if they come against us  we will whip them all the time and you will see  that we will do it. The United States are sending their armies to hold us still untill a Mob can come and  kill us and they have done this all time. we are the supporters of the United States Constitution, and we love  the Constitution and Laws of the United States. But it is the corrupt Administration of those Laws which we are suffering under and not the Laws. if the Laws had  been carried out in Missouri it would have hung Gov  Boggs Between the heavens and the Earth and all his friends who was in the murdering and expelling the Saints from  the states they shot down the mormons whenever they  could. They killed Hiram. Then when Col  Nauvoo with his armey He did not inq- uire who killed Joseph Smith or Hiram or any of the saints who had been killed but enquired for some missing  Man that we knew Nothing about and said he should Hold  me responsible for the life of that man. This has been the  course with the Government all the time. We got up a  Memorial or declaration to the Congress of the United  States last winter the Declaration was then read to the  Capt Van Vleeit after hearing it he said I cannot find any fault with it ownly it is couched in vary  strong language. President Young said that is what I  intended. And I will now ask capt Van Vleit if   ENDENTRY Aug 12, 1857 noDrummond was not the maine cause of the United States sending  thereir Armies against us "I think it is. There is not any of the government officers which have been sent here  who have any interest with us But they have tried to destroy us. Capt van vleit said this is the case with most men in the Territories they received their offices as a steping stone to the senatorship, but they have no interest for the people. This people have been lied about the worst of any people I ever saw the greatest hold the world  have now upon you is they accuse you of Burning 900 vol  of the United States Statutes. Thomas Williams who was one  of the owners of the Books which were burned denies their  being any Books of the United States being burned. I have  told the people all the time all I asked of them was to tell  the truth about us to pay their debts and steal Nothing they are welcome to go their way. Now if this government has arived at that state that they will tri to kill  the people for their religion No honorable man  should be afraid of them. President Young then told  the story about the Quaker that a Yankey went to whip the Quaker said that he was not the man that he wanted He had not done any thing wrong but the man said He would  whip him any how so the Quaker laid down his hat and coat  and said lie there religion untill I whip this man and he did whip him tremendiously. It will be so with the United States  if they insist in whiping us they will get awfully whiped Capt Van Vleit we have treated all men as well as we  have you who have been sent here as officers of the US  government. we wish still to treat them well and we  would like to ward off this Blow if we could But  the United States are determined to drive us to fight we cannot do any thing but what the government will take  exception to it. They will kill us if they can I have prof  of this. They killed Hiram in Jail not with stand- ing the faith of the Govornor the Armey and the states was  pleged to protect them, and when they had killed them they then got a writ for me I carried a large Bowie  knife with me and I said that any man that laid hands upon my sholder and said Mr Young you are my prisioner  I would send that man to hell across lots and I have said  that all the time since and I say it now I have broaken  now law neither will I be taken by any United States officers to be killed as they have killed Joseph. They did  once take a Bogus Brigham which was Brother Miller  and took him to Carthage and did not find out his mistake  untill they got him there. Capt Van vleit said that I do not think that it is the intention of the Government to take you but to instill a New Governor in this Territory President Young said I Believe that you tell the truth that  you believe this but you do not know their intentions as well as I do. when you get away from here you will think  of a great many things which you have seen and heard The people have all the time accused us of Colleagueing with the Indians against the Government and they were much afraid   ENDENTRY that Joseph Smith would go amoung the Indians and they  watched to keep him away from them but now they  have driven us into their midst and now I want you to  watch the signs of the times and you will see that God will  work against that Nations who are trying to destroy both  the Indians and Mormons the Government has become corrupt  and they are the ones who are breaking the Constitution of the United States and if it is ever saved it will be saved by the  Mormons who are the Elders of Israel    ENDENTRY September 13, 1857 ~ Sunday   13th Sunday I arose in the morning saddled my horse rode  into my field 4 miles and back I then went to the House of  Sister Smoot as she  was sick we then went to Meeting in the Tabernacle and  John Taylor Preached a splendid discourse upon the first  Principles of the gospel. He was followed by President  Brigham Young who said that he had had the persecu- tions of the Saints before him all the morning that He  was righteously angry He was so angry he could  not preach. But He did preach in the power of God  and told the people his Feelings. Capt Van Vleit set by  and when President Young spoke of the wickedness and cor- ruption of the government it made him feel at  the close of the meeting we met with the missionaries  who were appointed to lecture upon the subject of Home  Manufacturing we then went into council with the  presidency to select a company of missionaries to go  and make a settlement on Black foot fork 63 volunteered  and 42 of them were chosen at the close of this council I went direct to the Meeting at the Tabernacle Charles R Daina spoke first He had Just returned from England when  he went on his mission the Twelve Blessed him I was  mouth He said evry word which I proclaimed upon his  head was fulfilled to the vary letter. He was followed by  G. A. Smith who spoke of his southern tour, andc He  was followed by President Young who gave Uncle Sam  considerable Hell fire for their wickedness. At the  close of the meeting I met with the Missionaries again  President Young made a few remarks to them upon their  organization. we then went into our Prayer Circle and Presi- dent Young feasted the Breathrens upon Peaches and grapes  as we had so many meetings we had had no time for Eating  through the day at the close of the prayer Capt Van Vleit  met us at the close of the Stairs and said he had an express  from the states and wished to meet with Gov Young  I then went to the Historians office and prepaired  FIGURE 3 letters to T. B. H  Stenhouse I then went to Capt Hoopers and met  with Capt Van Vleit a short time after President  Brigham Young A. Carrington  J Taylor and a number of others. Capt Van Vleit  was preparing to leave at 3 oclok in the morning President  Young was now to have his last interview with him  and he wished to talk to him in a plain manner He said   ENDENTRY He wished Capt Washington Just  as things were here He said I have seen the suffering  of this people through the Persecutions of the people of  the United States for the last 25 years and I will not  bear it any longer. we have always treated the United  States officers well but they have constantly lied abo- ut us and tried to destroy us all the time. we would still  have received their govornors and officers if they had  sent them here without an Army but inasmuch as  they are now disposed to send an Armey here to  hold us still while others run their read hot Iron  into us and then kill us we will now say that we will  not have neither their soldiers Armies or officers  any more here at all, and you may tel them so we will  Just fight for our liberty and rights from this day forth whenever  I think of letting their troops come in here and their  officers I can see nothing but death and darkness before me and  before this people but when I say they shall not come here  light bursts upon me and I can see life before me and this people and this is the way all of this people feel. the intention  of the Government is to destroy us and this we are determin  they shall not do. If the government of the United  States persists in sending Armies to destroy us in the name  of the Lord we shall conquer them. if the Government  calls for volunteers in Calafornia and the people turn out to come  to destroy us they will find their own buildings in flames before  they get far from home and so throughout the United States  again if they commence the war I shall not hold the Indians  still by the wrist any longer for white men to shoot at them but  I shall let them go ahead and do as they please and I shall carry the war into their own land and they will want to let  out the Job before they get half through and even should an  Armey of 50000 men get into this valley when they got  here they would find nothing but a Barren waste we should burn evry thing that was wood and evry acre of  grass that would burn and you may tell them that they  must bring with them their forage for their animals  for they will not find any thing to eat in this Territory  when they come, again you may tell them they must stop  all emigration across this continent for they cannot travel  in safety the Indians will kill all that attempt it. You may tell Judge Douglass that when He comes here again to enter  into a treaty of peace we shall dictate those terms of peace  and not him as He did before.   Capt Van Vleit said that   if our Government pushed forward this thing and made war  upon us He should withdraw from the Army for he would  not have a hand in sheding the Blood of American Citizens After closing HeHis remarks President Young said God had  set up his kingdom upon the Earth and it was here and the Lord  would sustain that kingdom and he would destroy all that  fought against it And if the Armies of the United States came  against us the Lord would permit them to be destroyed at the  close of the remarks the President said to Capt Van Vleit as citizens  we are friends and shook hands in a Friendly manner and   ENDENTRY sept 13 1857 wished each other well we all wished the Captain well I went home and put up a Box of peaches of 32 dozen for Hon J.

Congress could send out an inves- tigating committee to Kansas or any other place but to   ENDENTRY Utah but upon the mere rumour of liars they could send  out 2000 armed soldiers to Utah to destroy the people without investigating the subject at all.

President Young said if an army comes to  help them in the spring we will use up this army first and  then we will use up the other before they get to the south  Pass. In the spring we must ask Allexander what He intends  to do inform him He must not stay there untill He gets rein- forcements in the spring and if they will not leave in the  spring we will use them up first the best we can in 10 days  we can put 2000 men around them which would soon use  them up.

The following is a synopsis of  the conversation President Young said if any officer comes  to the Armey the Govornor or Judges and send word that they  want to come in Just inform them that they are as near  as they can come Had they have come without a military  aray they could have come and not been molested but  now they cannot come we will not have any cursed  scoundrel forced upon us Jto Judge or rule over us and  they shall not Come among us.

All Prophets or Apostles or inspired men of God who have written or spoken concerning this Generation whether Recorded in Records revealed or sealed have pointed out clearly the events as they have transpired  and as they will transpire before our Eyes. It has now been over 30 years since Joseph Smith the prophet received the  gold plates from the Hand of the Angel Moroni from which He translated the Book of Mormon And it will be 28 years the  6th day of next April since the first Branch of the Church of  Jesus Christ was organized upon the Earth containing 6 members This little Branch of the Church like a small mustard seed has been nourished by the hand of God through all of its difficulties afflictions and persecutions, untill it is becoming the greatest off all herbs according to the parable of the Saviour who refered to it. It has continued to grow and flourish in the midst of a  strong warfare and opposition of wicked men and Devils  Untill it is growing into a kingdom in the midst of these moun- tains and Everlasting Hills as spoken of by Daniel and other Prophets. The Church and kingdom of God has had to wade through a scenery of persecution oppression and Blood inflicted  upon her by the inhabitants of the United States from its first commencement up to the present time untill many have been slain  and martered for their religion including the Prophet Joseph  who was the founder of the Church in this dispensation who was  shot in Hiram by a wicked and  hellish mob. As the Church has increased so has the opposition  increased against it untill the inhabitants of cities, towns,  counties and states rihave ^a^risen up in their wrath determined  to destroy the saints of God from off the Earth. The governors  rulers and people have all been united in this persecution and inasmuch as the Saints of God continued to grow and thrive the  whole United States Government with President James Buca Buchannan at there head have sent an Army of 2500 men to lay a foundation for our destruction. The Saints of God have  prayed that the Lord would hedge up their way that they could  not come into our valley to shed our Blood or that we need not  shed their Blood and the Lord has heard the prayers of his saints and has hedged up their way they came as far as Forts Bridger  and supply on the East side of the mountains and there have to remain  for the winter while we are still enjoying our homes and Firesides in peace to all human appearance that Great Nation the  United States with 25000000 of souls are determined to  Expend their treasures and use their force for the Destruction  of the Church and kingdom of God from of the Earth who  are now dwelling in thes vallies of the mountains. But we trust   ENDENTRY Jan 1st in God as we have done heretofore and now look forward with feelings of Deep interest to the Events of 1858 Believing that God  will preserve his saints and chastize his Enemies. The wicked  know not what they do "Darkness covers the Earth and gross darkness the people." "The Heathen rage and the people imagin vain things they say let our Eye look upon Zion and let her be defiled" "but they know not the thoughts of the Lord neither understand they his ways"  "The Lord will have them in derision, He will laugh at their calamity and mock when their fear cometh." Their destruction will come suddenly upon  them as a whirl wind and no power can Deliver them. The measure which they have meeted unto the saints, and seek to bring upon them shall be meeted unto them again as a Nation, as states, counties, towns,  cities, and families untill evry man who does not draw his sword  against his Neighbor will be oblieged to Flee to Zion for safety And  these things shall shurely come to pass for the Lord God has spoken it. Then prepare yourself O Land of America for the judgments of the God of Heaven await ^you^ and are nigh even at your doors For the Lord hath looked down from his Holy habitation and hath beheld all your  wickedness and abomination and all the Evil designs of your hearts  and all your secrets plans for the destruction of the Saints of the  Most High, for all these things God will bring you into Judgment and He will require the stewardship at the Hands of the President of  the United States and at the Hands of the senators, and Represen- tatives, and Govornors, and Judges, and all the Rulers of the Land  will all be heald responsible for the use they make of the liberties and blessings put into their hands and the whole people of the Land  who Elect the officers of Government will be held responsible for the conduct of those officers as well as their own conduct  in their dealings with the church and kingdom of God upon the Earth. Let us watch the signs of the times of 1858 And we shall  find that the Lord will soon come out of his hiding place and in his fury he will vex the Nation and in his hot displeasure he will  begin to cut off the wicked and unjust stewards and appoint them their portion with hypocrites and unbelievers.
