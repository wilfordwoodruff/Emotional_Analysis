Woodruf  Dear Brethering  ACording to the Reqwest made of  me at your ofice when I came home from my mistion to Sveden in giving an acount of my labers & travels I  wil her do so acording to the best of my understanding  I was caled at the Comforence held at the Tempel of St. Georg April the 8th 18757, and started from home Ce- der City the 23 rd the same monht reching Salt Lake City on the 5 th of may I aten ded the meting held in the Councel- house and was ther set apart by  Brother Orson Prat and I in Company  wiht Josef F: Smith & some twenty others for Europe left Salt Lake City on the 8 th of may foor of us being  for Skandinavian we reahed Kopen- hagen on the 2 nd of June the 3 rd we 
 Started in Company wiht Pret. Liljen- quist for a Comforence to Be held in Malm  Sveden I was ther apointed to laber as traveling Elder in what is caled Sk ne Comforence this com- prising Malim . Skristianstad and Blakinges Lan this being devided into 5 branches, Malm , Landskrona, Lund, Skristianstad, and Blakinges Branch, after viseting around among the saints and seking up some of my Relations I started in Company wiht another yong man into the contry but having been apsent from that Contry for ower 23 yars I had almost forgotten the langwig and not having had anny experiens in Mistionary life I felt my weaknes and inabillites of performing the dutes that lay before me I having to depend entirely upon the Lord for strengt. He in His merces showd to me in a dream wich I wil her relate to you it may be of som interest 
 Having got to the city of Helsingborg the 6th day of Juli I did not feel werry wal I laid down about 2. O'klok in the  afternon and I fell asleap and sleapt  betven one and two hours the dream is this, I dreamt that I saw a  great big Bilding the largest that I  ewer saw the wals was up and the Roof was on but a great deal of work  was yat to be done there where so manny arches of wood and of bricks and so manny brases and stais wherewer I  lockt that I tought I newer saw anny- thing like it before & I also had to work  in this Bilding this made me feel verry  Temed to think of working in such a  large Bilding and I Tought everybody  wold be locking at me but as I locked around to se the workmen that the had  ther I thought that I was just as good  a mason as the had there so I tock kurig  and went after my tols as I tought that  I had laid them in a Corner of the bilding 
 but it semed that my tools wher a  littel diferent to wat the had there and al the Peopel in the Bilding tur- ned around to lock at me but for al  it semed that I was sent there to work  and cold not get out of it but I  had it to do and I cold se the nesesety  for ther was a great deal of work to  do and werry few to do it, and I woke  This dream gave me enkurigment  and I wondered but felt much better than I had preveasly done acording to  my interpetation of this dream I tought  it suted my circomstanses the Bilding  being the Churh the arches brayses and  stays the Holy skriptures to seport the  Bilding and also seport me in my  administration or work in the bilding  I being a mason by trade my tools be-  ing the langwig  wich was not werry  esey to get along wiht for I was a strainger in my own land  I find in traveling among the Peopel 
 that the do not care about our religion  as the can find a much esier way of  going to Heven than we teach them  and that is the say the Lord have  done al for them He has died for ther ^since^ and al the can do is to sin this faiht to my astonihment have almost taken  the lead of the Peopel in that Land but  stil we are doing a littel a few is be- ing added to the Churh by Baptisim I wil her make mention of a remarkebel  insedent as hapened at Trelleborg a seatow^n^ on the sothern costs of Sveden a yong  women having aplied for Baptisim  and no other plase but the sea the wind had been bloing hard al day and the  waves was roling heavy the yongman  as was to administer the ordinance I  told him to be verry carful so that  the waves do not take you bought under  but to our astonishment the waves  went down and the water stod per- fektly stil and the sea was smoved 
 for about a rod al around them and  as the come up the sea come gust  a roling after them and wold dash up upon the land from tvo to fifeefive yards ther was present seven persons tvo of whom was not in the Church  and as the al remarked ^to me^ the had never  seen anything like it before this aswal  as manny other mannefestations of the  power of God made manefetst before my  eyes have strengtened my faith in the work that I am engaged in I have also  seen the Power of God made mannefest  in several instanses in heling of the sick  under my hands not onely in Sveden  but right here at home as my yongest  Child have almost been raised from the  dead gust before I started on my mistion  he them being about tvo yars old and is  stil living  I have traveled on fot nearly tre tousand  miles and atended one hundred and seven- teen metings Blesed one Child Baptised 
 nine confirmed eleven ordained one  Elder and Two techers.  The persekution is not so great as it use to be in that land we have a right to  Preach but not to administer anny of aur  ordinanses but thees things we genorally  find a time for although the laws them- selves are not so much changed but the  Peopel have grown more careles than the  was in the first rise af the Church in  that contry we are sometimes abused a littel af the people wiht the tong but that is nothing for that al slides af as I am satisfied that som persekution in some shape fmust follow the blever I do not know but wahat a littel af  the condition and circomstanses af the  saints ther wold proberbly be af some  interest as I have traveled and seen  every famely and saint in that com- forence wiht the exseption of one or two  fameles ther is wery few acording to  the condition of afairs at present that 
 wil ewer geat means anef to gather to  Zion and it seems ther greatest desiers  are to al the time how shal we get to  Zion I have told them if the wold be  fathful and do ther duty that the way  wold be opened for them in some way  but some af them seem to think that  the time is going and a great manny af them are pasing away without get- ting ther blesings and anointings but I wold tel them that if the had been faith-  ful the wold in no ways lose ther reward  manny af them have been in the churh from 12 to 20 yars and have ther done  ther dutes in paing ther thithings and  upheld the Elders that have been sent to them the condition af the saints in  that contry is realy worse than I had anny idear af, having been away from  ther so long but after getting more aquanted wiht afairs it was astonishing  to know how the live wages being ver- ry low last harvest. A man wold get 
 one krona a day or about 25 sents in our monny and wemen half that amount and  prvitions is as high there as it is here but laber is verry much saught after even at that as a great deal af laber- saving mashinery is being intreduced so that it takes the laber away from  the poor man for instance in my  youht. itA man wold stand and trish  al day winter wiht the flael but now is done wiht mashines and a great deal af the laber done by wemen as it is much cheper than men it is astonishing to see the wemen that is employed in  out dor laber you wold almost think that the had no men  It was told me before I emigreted  to this contry that we Mormons so  caled was coming to America to be slaves it is true I have workt hard as I told them ower ther but I cold  see how I in time cold better my  condition in life, the cannot see 
 the slavery that the are in themselves the kry about Utah and the slavery af  wemen but the need not go away from home to see it  I feel to thank the Lord that He have opened the eys af my understanding so that I in my youht cold see and un- derstand to that degre the princepels  af the Gospel af Christ so that I cold embrase the same for it has been the  means af plasing me in better condition in this life as weal as thousands af others that praps wold newer have owned a  couw had the staid in therir native land I wold like to say to the siants in  Utah as I promised the Peopel af the  saints over ther that the shold not forget the poor saints in foring lands aspeshialy those that is indepted tho the  P.

 612 Fan Ness Ave., San Francisco, Oct 12, 96.  The President of the Church of Jesus Christ of L. D. S.  Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brethren:  Sunday the 4th inst. we held our semi-annual conference here in San Francisco. We had a very delightful time. We had a full house at each of the three meetings. Much interest was manifest. The Elders have gone to their fields of labor with renewed determination all feeling well and enjoying good health. We had three applications for baptism last night. We had a crowded house.  It seems that we are meeting with some success here in San Francisco than elsewhere. We don't feel the opposition of our enemies so much here as we do in the [blank] places.

It was received with pleasure, yet I hate to leave the many friends here. I cant say that the release was a surprise as I have felt it for some time and I feel that it was the Lord's will for me to return, though my best energy would have been spent in furthering the  cause had I remained. I hope to always be doing all that is required of  me. I am very thankfurl for the kind expressions your favor contains. I  shall explain everything pertaining to the Mission to Brother Nye before I leave him. I will leave Tuesday for San Francisco where I hope to meet  my successor and establish his in the work of the mission.  I desire to leave every thing in a proper condition. I would not be satisfied to leave with a burden on the Mission for my successor to carry,  so I will send a report of the Mission up to date, and I hoep that satis- factory arrangments can be made for me square up all accounts here before  I leave. I have not yet received the September tithing receipt.  Tithing received:  Mary Christensen Sacramento $1.00 Iva Adams  1.1.50 Fannie Thackham  .50 Alfred S. Oldfield  5.75 Samuel Walker  9.00 F.

 612 Van Ness Avenue San Francisco, Cal. Sept. 29th, 1896  Pres. Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah  Dear Brother:  I returned from Sacramento and Latrobe last Thursday. We held some very successful meetings and were well represented by the press. We have just added six more to the church. There is a gradual increase in all of our congregations, yet we have plenty of indifference to contend with. I received the tracts and Voice of Warning you sent by the Elders.  I have been waiting anxiously for definite word about me staying  in the mission. My wife is not enjoying very good health and being whooly dependent upon others, it is almost more than she can do to care for herself and three litttle ones. If you decide for me to remain here and it be consistent with your feelings I would like  to have my family with me. But that would increase the expense and add unto your burden and it makes me feel that perhaps it would be better for you to send some one who is able to bear the expense. There are Elders who would carry the mission successfully if they could come and stay with me a little while until they become familiar with our methods and I believe it would be well to consider it before you de- cide to keep me. However the matter rests wholly with you. I am willing to do as you say and do my best to further the cause whether here or elsewhere.  Perfect harmony exists among the Elders and we are enjoying our labors, but we have some unpleasant things occasionally among the members. The other power has been working to divide our flocks but so far all little troubles have proven a benefit to us. I have just released Elder B. W. Henderson on account of the financial depression. He is a member of the Henderson and Sons firm at Oneida, Idaho, and is an excellant young man with good judgment. He has been in the  Mission 19 months.  When I sent in my report on the 2nd inst. the mission indebted- ness was $114.18. I borrowed the money of Bro. Scowcroft to carry me along but another month is almost gone and rents are due. I hope you will be able to make an appropriation of $150.00 for the benefit of the mission.  We will hold our northern conference here next Sunday, October 18th we will hold our Southern Conference in Los Angeles. I hope to leave for there about the 12th. Brother and Sister Scowcroft will accompany me south. I expect to be south two and one-half months. I will leave 
 estimate approximately at 25.00, if I get away in two weeks which I think  sufficient time to stay. My ticket to Frisco will be $10.00 and I would be glad to return by Portland which would add $10.. to the home trip,  making it $29.00 to Salt Lake, whcih will make immergent expenses amount to $150.00. If you will send me that amount I can settle the Mission expense and get home at the end of the expected time. I have borrowed what money I have needed here for the Mission expense which is included in the above amount.  Please write me at your earliest convenience at 612 Van Hess Ave., San Fransisco, and let me know if it meets your approval for me to return via Portland, and if I can do anything for you while here.  I have put the Richards matter in the hands of Elder Millard Scoveroft  who is a thoroughly competent business man and he will report to you the  outlook of the Richards claim and his proposals.  I hope to receive a receipt of the above tithing account and also a  check to balance the mission expenses as soon as convenient.  We held our conference here in Los Angeles the 18th ulcimo, where very encouraging reports were made. Our meetings in the south have not been largely attended though we look for better opportunities now the political confusion has ended for a season.  The elders are well organized in the two conferences under the imediate direction of Presiding Elders of experience so that Elder Nye, if he feels that our plans are good ones, can easily direct the mission and continue the plans already adopted with out trouble.  The Elders will all give Bro Nye their support and I feel that great good will be accomplished. Hoping to hear from you soon, and that are long I will have the pleasure of seeing you. I am very thankful for the support I have received and above all that I can feel in my heart that I have filled my mission in honor. My prayers will continue with the work though I may have to deal with sterner realities.  May God ever bless and prosper you and the people under your ^watch^ care is the prayer of your humble servant.  Your brother (Sgt)  Henry S. Tanner 
 Elder Henry Peterson in charge here when I am away.  I hope all is well with you and that I may hear from you at your earliest convenience.  We look for more success here as soon as the political kettle settles a little.  With kindest remembrance to you all, I remain  Your brother  (Sgd)  Henry S. Tanner

Conference Address, Box 71, Ridgeway, S. C.  THE TEMPLE, SALT LAKE CITY.  Joseph Sevier S. C.,Co, Utah July 5, 1897. Pres. Wilford Woodruf Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Bro: Having returned from a mission  to the Southern States without the  privilege of meeting with or visiting  any of the Apostles I thought I  would write you a few lines that  you might know of the safe arivel of My myself and Elder J. S. Cram of Kanab.  It was my  desire to report to you in person but because of the illness of Elder  Cram I was instructed by Prest Elias S. Kimball & Prest. S. P. Oldham of the S.C. Conference to see to his safe arival at  Bel- nap station on the Riogrand Western 
 Ky. six miles above here, where his  folks would meet and take care  of him. Before we reached here  we learned, that his folks were  waiting for him at Belwah, and  as he had improved ^in health^ some on the  journey he thought it unnecessairy  for me to go on with him to that  place.  I was set apart for a miss- ion to the Southern States Feb 22nd  1895 and started out on the following  day. On ariving at Chattanooga Tenn. I was appointed to lavor in the S. C. Conference. In company  with Elders Bond Stephenson &  Fortie I want to Columbia where  we met Prest Beatie I first labor ed with Elder G. S. Bralley in  Chester Co. then with Elder J. F. Hyatt in York Co. After conference  which was held in Williamsburg  Co. in the month of October I was sent  with Prest. S. P. Oldham to open up Barn

THE TEMPLE, SALT LAKE CITY.  S. C., 189  well Co. I remained there until Aug 1896. My next field of labor was York Co which place I continued untill my  release which was June 23. 1897.  Because of false reports the people of  York Co are generally very much oppos- ed to Mormons and Mormonism untill  it was often that we could not get to talk  or hold meetings with the people as we  would have liked. But with all I think  a greate deal of prejudice has and will  continue to be alayed. Twenty or more  persons have been united to the church  since Elder Hyatt and I went to that  Co. and I think there are several  others amongst the first friends that  the Lord raised up to us that will come  into the Church before very very much longer. 
 We have near Blacksburg (which place was in York Co but is  now cut off and forms a part of Cherokee Co) a Sunday  School with about forty members.  My health was very good the most of  the time.  While traveling I was greately bless- ed and protected of the Lord and  have received many testimonies that the  work is of the Lord. These blessings  and testimonies will be given to every  elder that will do the best he can however  weake he may be.  I believe the S.C. Conference is in a  thriving condition and will no doubt  continue to prosper for I believe the  elders do desire and are trying to carry  out council. Wall Dear President  I feel that I have not lost anything  by going on this mission and if there is  any other labor the Lord desires me  to preform with His blessings I hope to be able to preform it. May the Lord help us to preform every  duty and labor and keep us in the faith  is the preayer of  Your Bro. J. W. Parker.  The receipt of this letter should be kindly ackn- owledged, and the letter should be filed at the H.O.  J. F. S. 
 July 30 [189]7  President W. Woodruff Box B Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother,  For some time past we  have been trying to discover some  good method to adapt in this stake  to bring our people closer together. We  have felt that politics have scattered them  in such a manner as to bring much  injury to many of those who should be  more closely commited with all our  church organizations and in watching our  local newspapers we see them filled from  week to week with nothing but political quarrels. Our people are great readers  of the local papers and we are of the  opinion that if a local paper were started  here under the direction of the Presidency 
 of this stake with some of our leading bishops,  have it free from politics and devoted to  the upbuilding of our stake and the organizations of the church, it would do more towards  bringing our people together and creating  a better feeling among the people of the  various wards than any other one thing  we could do just at present. But before  doing anything in the matter we have  felt that it would be our duty to  write you regarding the same and  ask if it would meet with your  approval. If you have no objections  we would like to try the adventure. An early answer would greatly oblige  We are  Your Brethren in the Gospel T E Ricks Wm F Rigby Thos. E. Bassett
