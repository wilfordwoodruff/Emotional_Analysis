He revealed the principles of the Judgment. He said that God would Judge the world but How would He Judge the world He would  not sit in Judgment upon Each individual case. But the Lord would preside over all his Prophets and Apostles of Evry generation and He sent them forth with a dispensation of the gospel to the children of men in various ages of the world, those who recieved their testimony  and abided by their council would have no sins to pay for after  death, but the wicked would be Judged after death, it is said that  Christ will Judge the world But He chose 12 Apostles also 70 &amp; many  others as Helps. it is said that the 12 Apostles would sit upon Twelve   ENDENTRY 30 Thrones &amp; Judge the Twelve tribes of Israel but they will not Judge all individual cases. Joseph Smith will preside over this dispen- sation and Judge but He has chosen 12 Apostles 70 Priest, High Council, and Bishops to Judge the people Joseph will not Judge Each individual neither shall I neither do I want to spend my time  in listening to the sins &amp; nonsens of the People. But all the saints should  submit to the  tryed by his bishop and Judgment passed upon him &amp; the man submits  to that Judgment that is the End of the Law. and this is the fulfilling of  the scripture whare it says that "some mens sins go to Judgment before while other follow after" if the saints sin and they are tried, Judged  condemned, &amp; the saints submit to that Judgment they will never be Judged  afterwards. this power is given into the Hands of the Apostles or  those who hold the keys of the pristhood that "whosoever sins ye remit  are remitted &amp; whosoever sins ye retain are retained and whatsoever ye  bind on Earth is bound in Heaven." I do not Expet that there  will be much time spent after death in Judging the saints but the  wicked will have to be Judged. If I was to say that the  of this Church should be remitted &amp; forgiven it would be done but I dont want to say that for we have got to ma curses among us who will commit sin and I want them to pay for there sins many other inter by President F.
