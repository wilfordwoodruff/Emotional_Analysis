He revealed the principles of the Judgment. He said that God would Judge the world but How would He Judge the world He would  not sit in Judgment upon Each individual case. But the Lord would preside over all his Prophets and Apostles of Evry generation and He sent them forth with a dispensation of the gospel to the children of men in various ages of the world, those who recieved their testimony  and abided by their council would have no sins to pay for after  death, but the wicked would be Judged after death, it is said that  Christ will Judge the world But He chose 12 Apostles also 70 and many  others as Helps. it is said that the 12 Apostles would sit upon Twelve   ENDENTRY 30th 1862 Thrones and Judge the Twelve tribes of Israel but they will not Judge all individual cases. Joseph Smith will preside over this dispen- sation and Judge but He has chosen 12 Apostles 70ties and we have High Priest, High Council, and Bishops to Judge the people Joseph will not Judge Each individual neither shall I neither do I want to spend my time  in listening to the sins and nonsens of the People. But all the saints should  submit to the authority which is over them if a man sins and He is tryed by his bishop and Judgment passed upon him and the man submits  to that Judgment that is the End of the Law. and this is the fulfilling of  the scripture whare it says that "some mens sins go to Judgment before while other follow after" if the saints sin and they are tried, Judged  condemned, and the saints submit to that Judgment they will never be Judged  afterwards. this power is given into the Hands of the Apostles or  those who hold the keys of the pristhood that "whosoever sins ye remit  are remitted and whosoever sins ye retain are retained and whatsoever ye  bind on Earth is bound in Heaven." I do not Expet that there  will be much time spent after death in Judging the saints but the  wicked will have to be Judged. If I was to say that the sins of this Church should be remitted and forgiven it would be done but I dont want to say that for we have got to mayny poor curses among us who will commit sin and I want them to pay for there sins many other interiesting remarks were made  by President F.

He looked vary sheepish and wicked He partially hid himself behingd his brother John there were some 80 prisioners the remainder old men and ignorant were left with the women. the whole of the company of Prisioners looked wicked.

The Court was then declard opened Judge Kinney then said to the prisioners I want you to understand that you are here ^not^ to be tried but to be Examined. The Judge ordered the prisioners to be separated. Parsons and Peter Clemgard were placed by themselves as they were named in the writ. Judge Kinney appointed Mr Miner the Attorney for the prosicution and Broadhead said He was ingaged on the defence. But the prisioners denyed Employeding him Broadhead presented a petition for the Prisioners to have a committee appoi- nted to take charge of the property of the prisioners the Judge said the court would take charge of that business. Col Burton Cunningham and Golden came forward and were sworn as wit- neseses. Col Burton gave his testimony and said I am the the MaDepity Marshall of this Territory I attempted to serve 3 writs at south webber I went with a posse as I had good  reason to believe they could not be served without a posse this was on the 13 June 1862. The men called for would not give themselves up and I had to use force. I sent a communication to them and requested an answer in 30 minutes but I waited 90 minutes and received no answer then I fired a cannon Ball and they returned to fire with small arms and the fire kept up through the day. some Brethren came to me and  I organized them into my posse. Col Burton drew a map  of the fort and the surroundings. I tried all day to get possessin  of the fort but I ownly got possession of one or two Houses the first day. the Enemy fired all day but none in the night. On the mor- ning of the 14 we fired some in the morning But it began to rain and rained all day and we did not do much. Jared Smith was shot the first day and died. On Sunday morning the 15 of June we had fair weather I divided my forces as well   ENDENTRY June 198 1862 as I could and opened fire with Artillery and small arms from  8 oclok in the morning till 7 oclok at night at that hour I  planted a Battery nearby and took possession of one line of the fort then I saw a white flag I then told them to come  out and give themselves up they came out and stacked therir arms and surrendered Parsons was among those who surrendered I left my Men outside Except Mr Golden and Stodard I placed some men to take charge of the arms or guard them then Mr Morris made some remarks and asked me  what I wanted I said I wanted all the men who had taken  up arms against me. Then Morris said theo the croud all who will stand by me to the death lift up their hand and all as far as I could see lifted up their hands and made a  rush as though they were going to the school House or some place to defend themselves I ordered Morris to stop several  times and followed him up I had no arms but my revolver and as He would not stop I stoped him with my revolver He was shot dead. Banks was also shot through the neck from which wound He died two women was shot at  the same time which I vary much regret but it could not be helped the remainder soon gave themselves up Parsons denied that the people were under arms to defend them but did not state what they were under arms for Jeter Clinton then testifyed that what Burton had said was true. said that Banks told him that they did receive the message which Col Burton had sent to them Peter Wahlen was shot at 6 oclok sunday Evening  before the surrender.

Dow said I Joined Mor Morris and believed him to be a prophet and I dont know as I have done any thing to break the Law and I believe now that Morris ias as much a Prophet as he was before he died. Judge Keinney said I will dispose of this case and asked Miner if He knew of some more guilty than others. The Court separated the danes from the English and then addressed the English and said I wish to Explain to you the Law you hav violated. On the 22nd day of May a writ was made out for three man Morris Clemgard and Cook also a writ of Habeus Corpus for the delivery of 3 men who were falsly imprisioned I made this writ as it should be and placed it in the Hands of an officer this writ was sent by a proper but it was set at defiance and knowing that you was under the influence of Morris and fanaticism to a great degree that I let it rest 19 days then I issued another writ of Habaes Corp Habeas Corpus. you may Enjoy your religion but you cannot break the Law and shed Blood with impunit and in doing so you cannot Murder.
