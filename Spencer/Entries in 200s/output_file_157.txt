Skristianstad andBlakinges Lan this being devided into5 branches, Malm , Landskrona,Lund, Skristianstad, and BlakingesBranch, after viseting around amongthe saints and seking up some of myRelations I started in Company wihtanother yong man into the contrybut having been apsent from thatContry for ower 23 yars I had almostforgotten the langwig and not havinghad anny experiens in Mistionary lifeI felt my weaknes and inabillites ofperforming the dutes that lay before meI having to depend entirely upon theLord for strengt. He in His mercesshowd to me in a dream wich I wilher relate to you it may be of som interest 
 Having got to the city of Helsingborgthe 6th day of Juli I did not feel werrywal I laid down about 2. O'klok in the afternon and I fell asleap and sleapt betven one and two hours the dreamis this, I dreamt that I saw a great big Bilding the largest that I ewer saw the wals was up and theRoof was on but a great deal of work was yat to be done there where somanny arches of wood and of bricks andso manny brases and stais wherewer I lockt that I tought I newer saw anny-thing like it before & I also had to work in this Bilding this made me feel verry Temed to think of working in such a large Bilding and I Tought everybody wold be locking at me but as I lockedaround to se the workmen that the had ther I thought that I was just as good a mason as the had there so I tock kurig and went after my tols as I tought that I had laid them in a Corner of the bilding 
 but it semed that my tools wher a littel diferent to wat the had thereand al the Peopel in the Bilding tur-ned around to lock at me but for al it semed that I was sent there to work and cold not get out of it but I had it to do and I cold se the nesesety for ther was a great deal of work to do and werry few to do it, and I wokeThis dream gave me enkurigment and I wondered but felt much betterthan I had preveasly done acording to my interpetation of this dream I tought it suted my circomstanses the Bilding being the Churh the arches brayses and stays the Holy skriptures to seport the Bilding and also seport me in my administration or work in the bilding I being a mason by trade my tools be- ing the langwig  wich was not werry esey to get along wiht for I was astrainger in my own landI find in traveling among the Peopel 
 that the do not care about our religion as the can find a much esier way of going to Heven than we teach them and that is the say the Lord have done al for them He has died for ther^since^ and al the can do is to sin this faihtto my astonihment have almost taken the lead of the Peopel in that Land but stil we are doing a littel a few is be-ing added to the Churh by BaptisimI wil her make mention of a remarkebel insedent as hapened at Trelleborg a seatow^n^on the sothern costs of Sveden a yong women having aplied for Baptisim and no other plase but the sea the windhad been bloing hard al day and the waves was roling heavy the yongman as was to administer the ordinance I told him to be verry carful so that the waves do not take you bought under but to our astonishment the waves went down and the water stod per-fektly stil and the sea was smoved 
 for about a rod al around them and as the come up the sea come gust a roling after them and wold dashup upon the land from tvo to fifeefiveyards ther was present seven personstvo of whom was not in the Church and as the al remarked ^to me^ the had never seen anything like it before this aswal as manny other mannefestations of the power of God made manefetst before my eyes have strengtened my faith in thework that I am engaged in I have also seen the Power of God made mannefest in several instanses in heling of the sick under my hands not onely in Sveden but right here at home as my yongest Child have almost been raised from the dead gust before I started on my mistion he them being about tvo yars old and is stil livingI have traveled on fot nearly tre tousand miles and atended one hundred and seven-teen metings Blesed one Child Baptised 
 nine confirmed eleven ordained one Elder and Two techers.The persekution is not so great as it useto be in that land we have a right to Preach but not to administer anny of aur ordinanses but thees things we genorally find a time for although the laws them-selves are not so much changed but the Peopel have grown more careles than the was in the first rise af the Church in that contry we are sometimes abuseda littel af the people wiht the tong butthat is nothing for that al slides afas I am satisfied that som persekutionin some shape fmust follow the bleverI do not know but wahat a littel af the condition and circomstanses af the saints ther wold proberbly be af some interest as I have traveled and seen every famely and saint in that com-forence wiht the exseption of one or two fameles ther is wery few acording to the condition of afairs at present that 
 wil ewer geat means anef to gather to Zion and it seems ther greatest desiers are to al the time how shal we get to Zion I have told them if the wold be fathful and do ther duty that the way wold be opened for them in some way but some af them seem to think that the time is going and a great mannyaf them are pasing away without get-ting ther blesings and anointings but Iwold tel them that if the had been faith- ful the wold in no ways lose ther reward manny af them have been in the churhfrom 12 to 20 yars and have ther done ther dutes in paing ther thithings and upheld the Elders that have been sentto them the condition af the saints in that contry is realy worse than I hadanny idear af, having been away from ther so long but after getting moreaquanted wiht afairs it was astonishing to know how the live wages being ver-ry low last harvest. A man wold get 
 one krona a day or about 25 sents in ourmonny and wemen half that amount and prvitions is as high there as it is herebut laber is verry much saught aftereven at that as a great deal af laber-saving mashinery is being intreducedso that it takes the laber away from the poor man for instance in my youht. itA man wold stand and trish al day winter wiht the flael but nowis done wiht mashines and a great dealaf the laber done by wemen as it ismuch cheper than men it is astonishingto see the wemen that is employed in out dor laber you wold almost thinkthat the had no menIt was told me before I emigreted to this contry that we Mormons so caled was coming to America to beslaves it is true I have workt hardas I told them ower ther but I cold see how I in time cold better my condition in life, the cannot see 
 the slavery that the are in themselvesthe kry about Utah and the slavery af wemen but the need not go away fromhome to see itI feel to thank the Lord that He haveopened the eys af my understanding sothat I in my youht cold see and un-derstand to that degre the princepels af the Gospel af Christ so that I coldembrase the same for it has been the means af plasing me in better conditionin this life as weal as thousands af othersthat praps wold newer have owned a couw had the staid in therir native landI wold like to say to the siants in Utah as I promised the Peopel af the saints over ther that the shold notforget the poor saints in foring landsaspeshialy those that is indepted tho the P.

I shall explain everything pertaining to the Mission to Brother Nye beforeI leave him. I will leave Tuesday for San Francisco where I hope to meet my successor and establish his in the work of the mission.I desire to leave every thing in a proper condition.

 612 Van Ness AvenueSan Francisco, Cal. Sept. 29th, 1896Pres. Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City, UtahDear Brother:I returned from Sacramento and Latrobe last Thursday. We heldsome very successful meetings and were well represented by the press.We have just added six more to the church. There is a gradual increasein all of our congregations, yet we have plenty of indifference tocontend with. I received the tracts and Voice of Warning you sentby the Elders.I have been waiting anxiously for definite word about me staying in the mission. My wife is not enjoying very good health and beingwhooly dependent upon others, it is almost more than she can do tocare for herself and three litttle ones. If you decide for me toremain here and it be consistent with your feelings I would like to have my family with me. But that would increase the expense andadd unto your burden and it makes me feel that perhaps it would bebetter for you to send some one who is able to bear the expense. Thereare Elders who would carry the mission successfully if they could comeand stay with me a little while until they become familiar with ourmethods and I believe it would be well to consider it before you de-cide to keep me. However the matter rests wholly with you. I amwilling to do as you say and do my best to further the cause whetherhere or elsewhere.Perfect harmony exists among the Elders and we are enjoying ourlabors, but we have some unpleasant things occasionally among themembers. The other power has been working to divide our flocks butso far all little troubles have proven a benefit to us. I have justreleased Elder B. W. Henderson on account of the financial depression.He is a member of the Henderson and Sons firm at Oneida, Idaho, andis an excellant young man with good judgment. He has been in the Mission 19 months.When I sent in my report on the 2nd inst. the mission indebted-ness was $114.18. I borrowed the money of Bro. Scowcroft to carry mealong but another month is almost gone and rents are due. I hope youwill be able to make an appropriation of $150.00 for the benefit ofthe mission.We will hold our northern conference here next Sunday, October 18thwe will hold our Southern Conference in Los Angeles. I hope to leavefor there about the 12th. Brother and Sister Scowcroft will accompany mesouth. I expect to be south two and one-half months. I will leave 
 estimate approximately at 25.00, if I get away in two weeks which I think sufficient time to stay. My ticket to Frisco will be $10.00 and I wouldbe glad to return by Portland which would add $10.. to the home trip, making it $29.00 to Salt Lake, whcih will make immergent expenses amountto $150.00. If you will send me that amount I can settle the Missionexpense and get home at the end of the expected time. I have borrowed whatmoney I have needed here for the Mission expense which is included in theabove amount.Please write me at your earliest convenience at 612 Van Hess Ave.,San Fransisco, and let me know if it meets your approval for me to returnvia Portland, and if I can do anything for you while here.I have put the Richards matter in the hands of Elder Millard Scoveroft who is a thoroughly competent business man and he will report to you the outlook of the Richards claim and his proposals.I hope to receive a receipt of the above tithing account and also a check to balance the mission expenses as soon as convenient.We held our conference here in Los Angeles the 18th ulcimo, wherevery encouraging reports were made. Our meetings in the south have notbeen largely attended though we look for better opportunities now thepolitical confusion has ended for a season.The elders are well organized in the two conferences under the imediatedirection of Presiding Elders of experience so that Elder Nye, if he feelsthat our plans are good ones, can easily direct the mission and continuethe plans already adopted with out trouble.The Elders will all give Bro Nye their support and I feel that greatgood will be accomplished. Hoping to hear from you soon, and that arelong I will have the pleasure of seeing you. I am very thankful for thesupport I have received and above all that I can feel in my heart that Ihave filled my mission in honor. My prayers will continue with the workthough I may have to deal with sterner realities.May God ever bless and prosper you and the people under your ^watch^ careis the prayer of your humble servant.Your brother(Sgt)  Henry S. Tanner 
 Elder Henry Peterson in charge here when I am away.I hope all is well with you and that I may hear from you atyour earliest convenience.We look for more success here as soon as the political kettlesettles a little.With kindest remembrance to you all, I remainYour brother(Sgd)  Henry S. Tanner

Wilford WoodrufSalt Lake City, Utah.Dear Bro:Having returned from a mission to the Southern States without the privilege of meeting with or visiting any of the Apostles I thought I would write you a few lines that you might know of the safe arivelof My myself and Elder J. S.Cram of Kanab.  It was my desire to report to you in personbut because of the illness of Elder Cram I was instructed by PrestElias S. Kimball & Prest. S. P.Oldham of the S.C. Conferenceto see to his safe arival at  Bel-nap station on the Riogrand Western 
 Ky. six miles above here, where his folks would meet and take care of him. Before we reached here we learned, that his folks were waiting for him at Belwah, and as he had improved ^in health^ some on the journey he thought it unnecessairy for me to go on with him to that place.  I was set apart for a miss-ion to the Southern States Feb 22nd 1895 and started out on the following day. On ariving at ChattanoogaTenn. I was appointed to lavorin the S. C. Conference. In company with Elders Bond Stephenson & Fortie I want to Columbia where we met Prest Beatie I first labored with Elder G. S. Bralley in Chester Co. then with Elder J. F.Hyatt in York Co. After conference which was held in Williamsburg Co. in the month of October I was sent with Prest. S. P. Oldham to open up Barn 
 Southern States Mission,Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.headquarters, P. O. Box 103, Chattanooga, Tenn.South Carolina Conference.Conference Address, Box 71, Ridgeway, S. C.THE TEMPLE, SALT LAKE CITY. S. C., 189well Co. I remained there until Aug 1896.My next field of labor was York Cowhich place I continued untill my release which was June 23. 1897.Because of false reports the people of York Co are generally very much oppos-ed to Mormons and Mormonism untill it was often that we could not get to talk or hold meetings with the people as we would have liked. But with all I think a greate deal of prejudice has and will continue to be alayed. Twenty or more persons have been united to the church since Elder Hyatt and I went to that Co. and I think there are several others amongst the first friends that the Lord raised up to us that will come into the Church before very very much longer. 
 We have near Blacksburg (which place was in York Co but is now cut off and forms a part of Cherokee Co) a Sunday School with about forty members.My health was very good the most of the time.  While traveling I was greately bless-ed and protected of the Lord and have received many testimonies that the work is of the Lord. These blessings and testimonies will be given to every elder that will do the best he can however weake he may be.I believe the S.C. Conference is in a thriving condition and will no doubt continue to prosper for I believe the elders do desire and are trying to carry out council. Wall Dear President I feel that I have not lost anything by going on this mission and if there is any other labor the Lord desires me to preform with His blessings Ihope to be able to preform it.May the Lord help us to preform every duty and labor and keep us in the faith is the preayer ofYour Bro.J. W. Parker.The receipt of this letter should be kindly ackn-owledged, and the letter should be filed at the H.O.  J. F. S. 
 July 30 [189]7President W. WoodruffBox BSalt Lake CityUtahDear Brother,For some time past we have been trying to discover some good method to adapt in this stake to bring our people closer together. We have felt that politics have scattered them in such a manner as to bring much injury to many of those who should be more closely commited with all our church organizations and in watching our local newspapers we see them filled from week to week with nothing but politicalquarrels. Our people are great readers of the local papers and we are of the opinion that if a local paper were started here under the direction of the Presidency 
 of this stake with some of our leading bishops, have it free from politics and devoted to the upbuilding of our stake and the organizationsof the church, it would do more towards bringing our people together and creating a better feeling among the people of the various wards than any other one thing we could do just at present. But before doing anything in the matter we have felt that it would be our duty to write you regarding the same and ask if it would meet with your approval. If you have no objections we would like to try the adventure.An early answer would greatly obligeWe are Your Brethren in the GospelT E RicksWm F RigbyThos. E. Bassett
