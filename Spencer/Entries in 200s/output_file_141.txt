Many have made them- selves miserable thinking they had sined against the Holy  Ghost. others that they had sined a great sin. But what  have the Revelations of the Lord said upon these subjects we learn that Jesus Christ came &amp; took a body &amp; redeemed the world but Lucipher rebelled was cast down without any body and He has sought to vex &amp; destroy the children of men. He seeks diligently to draw all from the right path esspecially if a Saint  tries to follow the track &amp; get whare Jesus was then the devil would try hard to over throw them. Many have thought they have committed much sin when they have not understood the nature &amp; work  of sin. we must understand many principles &amp; arive at much knowledge before we can fully understand the Nature of Sin. The veil of Darkness is over the Earth so that the inhabitants of the  Earth are so overwhelmed in tradition &amp; darkness they do not know light from darkness truth from Error wright from wrong  or the difference between the dictation of the Holy Spirit or that conscienc which has been framed for them by the dictation of their mothers &amp; priests. many think far more of the  traditions of their youth than of any principle that God could reveal from Heaven unto them. their Mothers must  not do any thing on Sunday ^to^ darn a stocking would be a great sin, sin is one thing &amp; tradition is another. The word of God  revealed will tell what sin is while tradition will not The Education of the world is good as far as they have any truth found in any science which they possess but they do not  understand truth as connected with the plan of Salvation. I  want the saints here to understand that they cannot sin against  God, &amp; Jesus Christ &amp; the priesthood, against his family  &amp; the Saints then come &amp; ask forgiveness of the church then pass on smoothly &amp; ^think they will^ go to Heaven this is to cheap a way  to get to Heaven I want this subject riveted on your hearts if it is not you will not remember it. You must remember your covenants &amp; the Law of the Lord that is given to us. It is written  that sin is a transgression of the Law whare is it, in the Books that is given us in the main yet this does not go into all the me- anderings of life. whare do you find a law that you shall not drive a team across your Neighbor lot nor go to his hay stack or suffer your families to take liberties that you are not  willing should be done to you yet you know it to be wrong. But  do unto others as you wish others to do unto you is the Law &amp; the prophets. Some men who have been ordained unto the priesthood  &amp; are vary high in Authority will take the Name of God in vain &amp; swear by this &amp; that does such persons suppose that  that the Church can forgive that sin if you do your hope is vain they can never forgive that sin. No man can do it none   ENDENTRY  the time will come that if a man will take the name of God  in vain he will be hewn down without judgment or trial Hear it O ye Elders, for it is time. Let this people sanctify their hearts &amp; then take the Name of God in vain &amp; they will not be forgiven the time will also come  when if the parents are scanctifyed before the Lord &amp; their children rise up in disobedience against them they will be hewn down. If you sin against God &amp; take the name  of God in vain if you get forgiveness it will have to be forgiven by Him &amp; not from man. some think if they are alone &amp; sware or sin nobody will know it but they will find  themselves mistaken still if a man has to sware let  him be alone if a man damns himself let him be alone that others may not be polluted by his sin. If you take  the name of God in vain I will not forgive ^it,^ for I cannot if the Lord will forgive you I will forgive you for maring my feelings by speaking it in my ears the more you  see the veil parted &amp; the more you learn the more you will see Gods ways are not as our ways this people are passing through a great  school of experiance I remember while in Kirtland if any of the Brethren felt their rights infringed upon in any wise or abused would retaliate &amp; be ready to quarrel about it &amp; be ready to get up a law suit for ^a debt of^ three dollars but the minds of the saints have become more noble Now if a man is abused who understands principle he is above quar- reling about it and he feels to say it is nothing to me I am not to suffer by it but you that have abused me has the penalty to pay. But  if the devivel can ownly make you think that you are abused or  ill treated and you begin to fret about it and you give the devil power ^over^ you &amp; in the end it is as bad as though you had done wrong yourself Now if a man sins against you untill seventy times seven &amp; he repents  &amp; with an humble heart asks forgiveness you should forgive him  for this is the law  or he cannot be forgiven. As much has been said &amp; many fears entertained  speak further concerning that subject to sin against the Holy  Ghost is a sin against God the Father the Son &amp; the Holy Ghost that  bears record of them. A man cannot sin against the Holy Ghost  untill the Holy Ghost has revealed unto him the Father &amp; Son &amp; a knowledge of Eternal things in a great degree  when he has a knowledge of these things with his eyes open he  rebels against God &amp; defys his power He sins against all things if a man does sin against the Holy Ghost the people have nothing  to do with it for they cannot forgive that sin &amp; none but God can do it &amp; probably He will not in this world nor the world to come for they become sons of perdition &amp; probably will never repent of their sin or have a disposition to.    of God dont ask this people to forgive you for they cannot do it you may ask them to pray God to forgive you. If God does forgive the sin then you can go down into the waters of baptism when you get knowledge you will be ashamed to sin    do they not sin &amp; trespass against their Brethren Parrents against  their children &amp; children against their parents the husband against  the wife &amp; wife against the husband this is with us &amp; this we   ENDENTRY  to cease from taking the liberty of any person but do unto all as you would wish them to do unto you infringe upon the rights of no one Borrow no tool but what you will return according to promise take no wood nor any thing els but what belongs to you and if you  find any thing that is not your own do not hide it away but  report it that the owner may be found. If I had some stones here in my hand I could cast them &amp; hit twor or three in this congregation in the head who are guilty of these acts you may say  why dont you tell who they are why you poor Devil are you not going to repent of it by &amp; by. If not when the day of clensing &amp; santi fying of Israels comes you will have to be sacraficed &amp; your blood spilt upon the ground for the day will come when iniquity must scease in Zion and the Profane man who takes the Name of God in vain will be slain.    was dealt out in a manner that showed they understood principle &amp; revered the commands of God. it was a mercy to many to have Justice &amp; Judgment executed upon them on the Earth even to be slain &amp; have their blood poured out upon the Earth that it  might be tolerable for them God made a Covenant with Abraham &amp; his seed that He would save them when they commit sin He slew them that He might save them by  their spilling their blood as an offering. Had they have lived in sin they might have sinned so as not to have been forgiven or saved. it was a mercy to slay them. Now Brethren if  you sin against God go to God to get forgiveness if that sin is not unto death their is a sin unto death which we were told we need not pray for. if you sin against your Brother go to him  to get forgivness ask forgiveness at the hands of the inocent if you sin against your family your parents your husband your  wife your childrn seek forgiveness at their hands but what is done in secret should be forgiven in secret &amp; go no further that sins may be hid. But if sins are committed openly they should ask forgiveness &amp; be forgiven openly these are true principles &amp; let them be rememberd forever    assembly of the Territory of Utah upon slavery He remarked that the whole world were slaves Eve partook of the forbidden fruit &amp; also Adam &amp; it brought slavery  upon all their posteriy in some way or other &amp; this will continue untill we become righteous enough to drive  the devil &amp; evil from the Earth. Adam had two  sons Kane &amp; Abel.  Abel Adam was called to offer secrifice also his sons the  sacrifice of Abel was more acceptable than Canes &amp; Cane took it into his heart to put Abel out of the way so he  killed Abel the Lord said I will not kill Cane but I will put a mark upon him and it is seen in the face of every Negro on the Earth and it is the decree of God that that mark shall remain upon the seed of Cane &amp; the Curse untill all the seed of Abel should be redeemed and Cane will not receive the priesthood  salvation untill all the seed of Abel are redeemed any man having one drop of the seed of Cane in him   ENDENTRY  other Prothet ever spake it before I will say it now in the name of Jesus Christ I know it is true &amp; they know it the Negro cannot hold one particle of Government but the day will come when all the seed of Cane will be Redeemed &amp; have all the blessings we have now &amp; a great deal more but the seed of Abel will be ahead of the seed of Cane to all Eternity let me consent to day to mingle my seed with the seed of Cane it would bring the same curse upon me and it would upon any man and if any man mingl his seed with the seed of Cane the ownly way he could get red of it or have salvation would be to come forward  &amp; have his head cut off &amp; spill his blood upon the ground it would also take the life of his Children It is said if a man kills another that he takes that that he cannot give if a mans head is cut off his life is not destroyed or his  spirit that lives, his tabernacle is destroyed but I can make as good tabernacles as I can destroy if you do not believe it look at my Children. Much blood was  shed in ancient days both of man &amp; beast the firstlings &amp; best of the flock was sacrafized on the Altar &amp; in  some instances many men &amp; almost whole Nations was sacraficed or put to death because of their sins &amp; wickednes this was the ownly way they could be saved at all if Jesus Christ had not had his blood shed the blood that He received from his Mother Mary the world  would not have been saved. Their is not one of the seed of old Cane that is permitted to rule &amp; reign over  the seed of Abel and you nor I cannot help it Those that do bear rule should do it in righteousness I am opposed to the present system of slavery the Negro should serve the seed of Abram but it should be done right dont abuse the Negro &amp; treat him cruel. It has been argued here that many of  the Jews were Judah  mingled with the seed of Cane they lost their priesthood &amp; all blessings. as an ensample let the  Presidency, Twelve, Seventies, High Priest Bishops &amp; all the Authorities say now We will all go &amp; mingle witth the seed of Cane and they may have all the privileg they want we lift our hands to heaven in support of  this that moment we loose the pristhood &amp; all blessings &amp; we would not be redeemed untill Cane was. I  will never admit of it for a moment some may think I dont know as much as they do but I know that I know more than they do. the Lord will watch us all the time the Devil would like to rule part of the time but I am  determin He shall not rule at all and Negros shall  not rule us. I will not admit of the Devil ruling at  all I will not consent for the seed of Cane to  vote for me or my Brethren if you want to know why we did not speak of it in the Constitution  it was because it was none of their business   ENDENTRY  the Jews come here with a part of the Canaanite blood in them they are Citizens &amp; shall have their rights but not to rule for me or my Brethren those persons from the Islands &amp; foreign countries know nothing about governing the people. The Canaan ite cannot have wisdom to do things as the white man has. We must guard against all Evil I am not going to let this people damn themselves as long as I can  help it    ENDENTRY February 8, 1852    and said I trust in the Lord for light as I have  heretofore done when the minds of men are open  to understand they will see things as they are. we are subject to all the evils which are in the world. I have thought this world as fallen as any of the creations  of God. when the Lord created the Earth or any world  if they have an Exaltation they will have to experine  all that we Experiane I see no reason why they  should not be tempted as we are tempted. If we are candidates to exhaltation &amp; glory &amp; that we cann ot get that Exaltations &amp; glory in no other way then we should be reconciled to it &amp; be satisfyed to let the Lord do with us as He pleases is their any Evil upon any pe person or affliction upon any Nation or kingdom  that God does not permit their is not we should then be faithful to God in all things to be his  secret counsellor if necessary why should we com- plain or find fault with God about any thing we  should not. Se the Example of the Nations of the Earth they complain about evry thing and against all his providences their is no proceding of ours or act or ex periance but what He knows all about. If it would be any satisfaction to you I would say that God has passed through all the trials &amp; experience that we have Jesus Christ has passed through all the trials &amp; experine the same as we have it would not be prudent for me to say that the Father has not the same experiene that his Son had. He had quite as much as his Son had, let the Saints look about themselves &amp; se if they ha they first received the gospel &amp; the Holy Ghost opened their minds they saw that Zion was to be built up &amp;  Israel gatherd the power of God &amp; the Holy Ghost to be poured out upon us. If we could get a place by ourseles how faithful we would live &amp; thank God. Do you have  the same things you looked for well I dont know you say this shows that somebody has let down their watch &amp; inf- luenced others &amp; they have not lived up to their privileges when we first received the gospel we were humble but since the tempteor has come &amp; we are tempted with many things but this is right the Lord permits it we could not get glory without it let me ask if any   ENDENTRY  The feeling was If I could get with the Saints all  my sorrow &amp; trouble would be at an End so it is  with the Saints in England. Before we preached  the gathering to them the lord revealed to them that  they would be gathered we told them not to reveal  it untill the time came do you have any thing now  that you looked for in the begining if not sumthing is  the matter you dont do right you dont settle this  difficulty or that but what is the matter you are wrog  yourself what henders you from praying all day &amp;  fasting and prayer you have enough to eat but the  great difficulty is when they moved to Zion they  brought themselves with them you had so many devels  in you that they trouble you. when the devel &amp; wicked  men have afflicted &amp; persecuted us as far as is for our  good then the Lord says stop &amp; go no further they are held  up but if we take evry thing patiently all our afflictions will work together for our good. But do you at the present  time have any thing to mar your peace except what you  bring upon yourselves you have privileges here but do  the people prize their privileges why do the people go to  the kanyons after wood on Sunday why have they gone  today why dont I do it why do I not visit my farm  the Bath House on Sunday because it is not right &amp; sets  a bad example I cannot do these things on the  Sabbath Some will take poles off from his Neighbors farm  take a chain or an ax without liberty this is wrong their is nothing on Earth to mar our peace but o own acts but the great difficulty is they cannot get away from themselves. they think perhaps if they  go to the gold digings they can get away from themselves but they cannot. When persecution &amp; trials come  they search the good seed and it dries up. How are you  going to get Zion nothing henders our having Zions  but ourselves we have all the privileges of Angels to  worship God &amp; get all blessings we need. we mean  to war with all Devils temptations &amp; trials untill we  overcome I will fight untill I overcome if I fall  in the grave their is others who will take my place their are many who will fight &amp; if it needs be we will take the sword I hope all who want good principles  will have the privilege of receiveing them to day is a day of  tithing &amp; sacrafice tomorrow cometh the burning I would say  that you cannot be perfect without me nor I without you  the providences of God has so interwoven &amp; identifyed  the interest of the Children of Adam together that they  cannot be perfect without each other do you enjoy your- selves &amp; have peace. I have peace &amp; no man can take it frm  me if you do not have peace it is because you drive stakes  &amp; the Lord will not let you do it but let the will of God  be done if you dont Enjoy Zion it is because you dont say  let the will of God be done their is nothing to take your  Zion away but yourselves we are to be tryed &amp; tempted   ENDENTRY  in all things &amp; God will bless you my prayer is that God will bless this people &amp; that they may be faithful and  a friend to God.

It is no small matter to address such a sea of faces if the Lord does not pour out his spirit upon me it will not be but a little benefit for me to speak yet I do feel a great desire for the Lord to give me his spirit for your sake that you may be edifyed I feel anxious to receive principle &amp; the salvation of the living &amp; dead what has  that to do with the living it has much to do with it it is a truth revealed from Heaven that we are to be saviors upon Mount Zion to redeem the living &amp; the dead this is the subject that is given to me I am determined to trust in God who will give any man their portion in  due season the responsibility of preaching this gospel  to all the world &amp; redeem the dead we must live before  the Lord in such a manner that we can have his appro- bation what says the Book of Mormon upon this subject those that assist in building up Zion &amp; shall do it by faith shall have the blessing of the Lord upon them How will we  do it by listening to the council of the priesthood of the Church &amp; consecrating ourselves before God to his service as we were told by Presidet Young we shall then have  the power of the Holy Ghost &amp; what greater gift can we  have then this for this will teach us all things and if a faithful man is sent abroad to any Nation to preach the Gospel &amp; is faithful &amp; follows the spirit of truth He will accom plish his mission in spite of all Earth &amp; Hell. when Nephi was sent back to get the plates of Brass &amp; his brethren would not go the Lord told Nephi that He was stro nger than 10,000 men to go &amp; He would deliver the plates into his hands he went &amp; done as the Lord told him &amp; got the plates look at this people our enemies told us we must go away to the west &amp; not stay with them untill we were driven into the Rocky Mountains but the Hand of the Lord was in it &amp; the Leaders of this people were as much inspired to  come to this place as the Nephits wer to get the plates   ENDENTRY  what we could not have done we see today a great mass of Saints before us we have been sustained by the Hand of God in all thes things. The Lord hath said I will give you an inheritance that you shall have in time &amp; Eternity and Israel shall be led by the keys which I have given we have been led into a goodly land with our good Houses &amp; fields of grain &amp; all good things so their is Hardly room  enough to receive it can it be possible that any man  after seeing all the goodness of God up to this time  can have a doubt about this work being true can you  find a people that has got wisdom enough to get a revela- tion for themselves unless God is with them this people are willing to do all things as far as they understand the Mormons  are increasing &amp; will incres and their is no power that will stop the work of the Latter Day Saints. I rejoiced this  forenoon while looking upon the faces of the saints &amp; to see the spirit of God upon them &amp; that their union was increasing &amp; that they wished to hear &amp; learn truth He refered to a certain Revelation that said that Zion should look upward &amp; their Union be incresed &amp; was strengthened then Zion should look down from above  refering to the Zion of Enoch And that Zion would come  &amp; the Heavens would shake with gladness &amp; the Earth would tremble with gladness and they will build up each other I want to see that day come that we may see the Old  alem in comparison to what will be at that time. Here are the Twelve &amp; seventies &amp; thousands who will bring the gospel  to all men and Israel who are numerous will have to have the feelings all manifested to them they must be visited &amp; instructed as we have been they must be gathered  as we have been we cannot be perfect without them no more than they can be perfect without us they all must be gathered from the fore quarters of the Earth &amp; be instructed together &amp; be prepared for  the coming of the Lord is there not a prospet of this being done yes their is  could have a view of the state of affairs in England their was some 40,000 saints baptized when I left and there was not one in 400 but what would give  all they possessed  many of them would be faithful if they were here again would not the saints of the western Islands be glad to come here they would &amp; they will come you remember  the parable of the vineyard that the servants of the Lord  had to labour &amp; keep the top &amp; roots Equal so that the top need not be to heavy for the roots if we can get a  few thousands of the Saints that we can teach &amp; instruct so that they will become strong in faith &amp; works then we wan bring in thousand of weaker ones &amp; they get tried  the strong ones can succor them &amp; they become strong also &amp; the Devil have No power over them &amp; Zion will soon  be Esstablished &amp; thousands upon thousands will come from the Nations to take shelter under the tree of Liberty in the gospel &amp; kingdom of God from the dire calam   ENDENTRY  the whole Earth there is sumthing els to be done to prepare  this people for coming Events Here are many of the remnant of Joseph that have got to be felt after &amp; redeemed I believe the signs of the times indicate that that the time has come when  the work must commence if they are sunk in the lowest depths of degredation yet they are the chosen seed the desendants of Joseph who was sold into Egypt the promises are unto  them they must be redeemed could we be placed in a better condition to commence the work than we Now are we cannot look what way we will they are all around us and the prom- ises of God are to be fulfilled then shall we not pray for them let us exercise faith in their behalf &amp; do all we can  for them. No you not they are to be the main instrumts that will build up Zion &amp; Her Temples and all the Gentiles who repent shall assist the remnant of Jacob to build up Zion &amp; the power of Heaven will come down to Help them. First we are to introduce the gospel to them &amp; teach them the principles of the Kingdom of God &amp; give them the prie- sthood. Do you want to see the Zion of God built up &amp; the  Temple of the Lord reared up in this Generation upon the conse- crated land then pray for the remnets of Joseph &amp; their  redemption for they have to assist in gathering all the House of Joseph &amp; when they all get together the Heavens can no longer be stayed but their prayers &amp; faith will prevail &amp; the Heavens will come down &amp; meet with the Saints then be ready ye Elders of Israel to go when the Lord calls  upon you by his servants to leave all to go to preach the gospel to them in their own language &amp; tongue and the power of God will rest upon you I believe the Lord  will send forth his messengers who are ordained unto this power to go forth unto the Lamanites &amp; will clothe them with far greater power than when they were sent unto the  corrupt Gentiles the Lord will not come untill we go to  this people we have a portion of the power of God with us but not in its fulness as it will be in days to come this people will have to be tried in all things &amp; proven &amp; whn they are found faithful &amp; united they will then thrash the  Nations by the power of the spirit of God &amp; they cannot Help themselves    a few remarks. Felt to rejoice in the principle that had  been presented to us they had cheered his heart &amp; the Hearts of this people I hope we shall improve &amp; be faithful for these principle are true The Lord says my people shall be willing in the day of my power that people who have givn the war hoop &amp; crept through the brush find the spirit of God &amp; of their Father Jacob once more running through their veins &amp; the people who think they are almost extinguished will find they are still alive &amp; will fulfill all that is said concerning them. But I must say nothing I must  Hush. I will Hush. But will God Hush &amp; be still No He will stir up the remnants of Joseph in his our  &amp; in his own time.

Presidnt  Youg remarked that No doubt before you get home you will  hear we have committed treason.    cost will be read before the meeting and all the Tithing &amp; outlay  but if you feel that if your Expectations are realized you should  be satisfyed I will say I never saw No one room as convenient  as this it will seat 2200 persons &amp; their  today. I expect the Tabernacle which we expet to build on this Block will seat fifteen Thousand people we never did  build a House large Enough to Hold the people if we was to  this whole 10 Acre Block so that it would hold 200,000 people  by the time we got it done their would be enogh to fill it. The  Lord is controlling our affairs &amp; does more for us than we can   ENDENTRY  humble &amp; labour &amp; prepare for the gathering of Israel the faster  they will gather the Esstablishment of this Tabernacle was  the result of my meditations while upon a sick bed    speak let him rise up &amp; speak &amp; use his liberty I feel as  usual to praise the Lord with all my heart. The hand of  God has been as visable in leading this people as it was in  leading Israel in the days of Moses some had not faith to come  on for fear of Starveing to death. dont be in a Hurry to go away but stay untill you have worshiped Enough at this time    the kingdom of God had No Doubt of it    to what is said Here I know as the Lord lives that the people  of the United States have departed from the spirit &amp; letter  of their Constitution and this people will be the ownly  the people that will sustain ^it^    signify that we cannot worship as other Sects do but want  to exercise our rights it is considered Treason but a  Senator from South Caralinia could rise up in the Halls  of Congress &amp; declare that that the United States was more  tyranical than the Goverment of Austria &amp; South Carolina  would reject the Goverment this would not be considered  treason but dont be alarmed God rules our destiny  &amp; will rule the world &amp; if we do our dooty their is no  power that can harm us for we will make God our ref uge    work of God Had Been in the Church 21 years in June next     time He had been to a Dedication of a House built to worship  God I was at Kirtland while the Angel of the Lord came in  &amp; sat there During service. A Hymn was sung &amp; adjned  till 2 ock    then Said we shall now lay before the Conference the manifesto  of the Recepts &amp; Expenditures of the Tithing from Oct 1848  to March 27                              ENDENTRY                                                                                                                       made by the Recorder  which are not here incerted explanaton of the same  Those figures with No explanation opposite  was lost in reporting or not put down    consolation there has not one Dollar gone into the hands of a Lawyier as in the days of Joseph at that time almst  evry dollar had to go into the hands of the Lawyiers they prosecuted him all the day long. But I said I would  kill any man that sought to take me many thought my purse reached from Eternity to Eternity that there was  No End. we were Called bogus makers Brother Kimball  said we would go whare we could coin the pure gold  at a lick we have done so even $20 at a time Our Brethen  went to Calafornia the Hand of God was in all this they opened the gold mines and the Lord had a Design in it to see who  would be tryed by it. Never did nor never will any of the  saints go to dig gold ther without being sent without being damned by it mark my words if we go onto the  be left to  sent there by the Lord I would go but the Lord has not called   ENDENTRY  it &amp; smutted themselves up so that it is quite a question if  they will ever be washed clean I have said I did not think  their was $1 in $20 paid in Tithing that has been spent  on the public works but it seems from the Book that  there has been about one fourth the other three fourths  I have had to borrow. If I have to borrow all the  money that is used and none assist me to pay it it will  make my head ake I have trusted the Lord &amp; served him  all the day long and when I undertake any thing I persevere untill I accomplish it I see the difference betwen trusting in God &amp; doing business according to the order of the world their is not one hair droped from my head unnoticed  &amp; does God not know what I want. their never was a  miracle ownly to the Ignorant. It is all to be accounted for  on Natural principles. The Lord will not turn stone &amp; clay  into gold to suit me their is enough without it Jesus did not make  bread out of stone but He had knowledge &amp; power &amp; did call togethe the Elements to make bread &amp; the Elements into the water to make  wine &amp; he can call the Elements together to make gold as well  as bread &amp; wine. But the Lord is not going to work a miracle to cloth us raise your wool &amp; flax &amp; spin &amp; weave it &amp;make it up &amp; not  have to pay cash for evry pound you use &amp; what you by is hardly worth making up but what you make is strong &amp; will wear          The Elders filled the House at an Early Hour and was addressed by  President B. Young who arose &amp; said this is certainly a mixed  congregation of all the Officers of the Church we are to be instruct ed in all things. the knowledge that is now in the midst of this people is  more than in all the world besides. All sceince is in the midst of this people even if they have not learned it as the world has. I have  my cogitations &amp; views of the affairs of this kingdom but I have  learned that we must  fail in it but if we work in faith &amp; confidence the Lord is  apt to Help us. I asked a favor of the Bishops to divide the money  debts in Each ward, that it might be paid. Let us contend with ourselves &amp; disipline ourselves untill evry thing that is within us is brought in subjection to the Law of Christ you have been taught the first principles of the gospel now teach yourselves &amp;  the Church. Our school is the school of the prophets this is a school  to plain &amp; polish ourselves and suppose under such privilege we  should endulge in Evil &amp; neglect our families &amp; our duty to God all our former sins would be upon our Heads it is for a man  to commit himself &amp; all that He presides over unto God to do his will  &amp; continue to do it untill you are sanctifyed. if your Neighbor  does you Evil do not do evil to them bear with him &amp; set him  right but do not quarrel with him but be careful that you  conduct yourself well untill you are prepared for the society of Holy  men this is as I said the school of the Prophets Our Baptism is  ownly the begining of our work you must then go on to perfection you must perform this work our children understand the gospel  but do they understand the way to govern their lives we will never  se a day but what we can learn we shall not inherit the glory of  God all at once or understand all knowlede but God teaches us small  principles to prepare us for greater ones Let us learn in this school ENDENTRY  main Branch of our study is  any of the world. Adam, Enoch, Moses &amp; Aaron, Jesus &amp; the Apostle have all been in the same school in their day &amp; have faithfuly lernd  that they might be perfected. They are my Brethren &amp; will be my  company and I now tell you if you want me to have full fellowsip with you scease speking Evil of God &amp; all good men whether in  Heaven or on Earth.    &amp; lay down any thing at the feet of a Brother to settle a difficulty  &amp; rather wrong themselves than to have a difficulty do for the truth sake &amp; my sake take my councel.

Some Elders that was called to go on that Mission sent  gold diggers to go in their place &amp; fill the mission for them I  never thought of leaveing a mission that was given me untill  that mission was  to build &amp; put in grain then Left it in the spring &amp; go home.

The warfare of the saints is great in the Earth in this dispensa tion &amp; we should all take hold of it with a determination to conquer  &amp; never scease untill our warfare is accomplished and evry man  will be satisfyed with his reward in the End. many other remarks  were made by the speaker who soon gave way for Orson Spencer  the chancellor of the Deseret University who delivered an address upon  Education    of Education which he read from his manuscript which I suppos  will be published in the Deseret News so I did not report it    &amp; Exalted minded persons she would teach good principles to her  children A person without any Education would be as ignorant as  the unborn child for whatever knowledge a person did possess he got  it by some kind of Education. Some think that Education consists  sol any persuit of life. We have got to create all we have out of the  Elemets aroud us &amp; we want to learn how to do it we  must manufactur all we use for if we get any thing from  the States we will have to pay High for it. if not bring us into  Slavery by it therefore we must lay a plan to beat our Enemies  or they will beat us       at is to Enlighten the mind it is expected we have to learn  letters with regard to the principle of Education it commen ces with the mothers I do not like to see Mothers attend to every  thing Els but their children they should teach their children  all they can for Early impressionn will last persons throgh  life whether they be good or bad I will tel you the truth as it  is in Eternity if the child does not have good instruction  in Early life it will be required at the Hand of the Mother  &amp; not at the hand of the    ENDENTRY  &amp; the mother has power to instill into the mind of the child  what they please, &amp; what the Mother imparts unto them will  stay with them through life the Mother should take care of the  children &amp; not spend their time watching the Husband  it is the duty of Mothers to Stay at home &amp; take care of the  children.

If any one of my Children will  not follow my footsteps I will disinherit &amp; disown them  they shall not have part in my kingdom I would rather  get children adopted to me that will keep the command ments.

A Tabernacle is to  assemble the Multitude for meetings but a Temple is to gather the  priesthood in that they may do the work of the Lord are  we prepared to go &amp; redeem our dead is their a place prepared  to go &amp; Redeem our dead No their is not we give Endowmets  Here but it is like trying to step on the top round first. if we  had the privilege of  would not be legal but we do these things untill we have time  to build a temple if we had gone onto the top of the mountains  if we had no room it would be legal &amp; right Brothe Kimball  says we have to make our own heaven. The Lord cannot  save us if we do not save ourselves. if we expect to get our Endowmets we have got to follow the footsteps that God has set for  us to walk in &amp; if we walk in that Channel God own our labours  &amp; acknowledges all that is done. Now all the ordinances will have to be attended to again when we get a temple yet if any  one dies in the faith those ordinances will be legal but all  that live will have to do it again And I want to say as a  Revelation that if you will not help build a Temple &amp; have faith in the work you will be lost a word to those who  have got their Endowments we shall work as fast as  we can and what we have done is legal if we had been  in own land &amp; had a right to a Temple we should not do as we now  do many who have died in the faith have been worn out ther  ordinaces are legal. Those who came in the church first &amp;  are faithful have a right to the ordinances first. I wish  the people to understand that when the  any thing for them they will have it but when the  Lord has Nothing for the people I dont wish them  to teaze me for what they cannot have. when their  is to be a work done I will tell you. Now we shall begin  to build a Temple in 1853.

I am entitled to the Keys of the Priesthood  according to linage &amp; blood, so is Brother H. C.

Joseph Smith was entitled to the Keys of the Priesthood according  to blood still he was the  Temple built then we will teach you concerning these things suffice it to say that I will extend the chain of the Prist- hood back through the Apostolic dispensation to Father Adam  just as soon as I can get a temple built. Jesus could have  restored the order of the Pristhood in his day &amp; brought in  the Millenium if the people would have harkened to his inst- ructions but they rebelled &amp; would not, &amp; it was for this  cause that Jesus told them that all the blood that had been  shed from righteous Abel down to Zechariah the Prophet should  be required at there hands.

Jesus had reference  to the same thing when He told his deciples not to call any  man Father on earth for their Father was in heaven. The seal of the covenant that I have been speaking off  to day was what the Apostle saw previous to the destruction  of the wicked when the Angel was commanded not to  out the vials of wrath on the wicked untill the saints were sealed  in the Adams family.

Pratt also addressd the meeting a few moments bore testimony to the truth &amp; also rejoiced to meet with them. There was then an intermission untill after supper The table was well furnished &amp; supplyed. 40 persons could  be seated at the Table at a time. the men were seated to the  right with there companion oposite them. commencing with the  Twelve President Young at there head. then in order the adopted  children begining with the 1 &amp; choir kept their seats, &amp; continued there sweet strains of music  while the guest were partaking of the rich festival. While at the  table Brother John ^H.^ Tippets entered the  house they came direct  280 miles south of River Riogrand on the 10 of Nov 1847. they piloted 56 sick men to Fort Purbolo whare  Capt Brown esstablishment were stationed from there  came in on Pack Mules were 50 days on the way. were taken  prisoners twice by the Indians, once was sentence by the Pawnees were 30 days without bread &amp; 5 days witho ut much of any thing to eat.

They were seated to the table in the  guar through the camp. men &amp; women came in all directions  to enquire after there friends in the Armey. After the men  were refreshed we went into council with them &amp; they rehears ed the situation of the Battallion that they had been on  half rations for three weeks when they left them &amp; no prosp- page torn ects of more than half rations should they attempt to cross the page torn mountains this winter.

House. found the Saints rejoicing in what had heard through  the day. Elder Isaac Morley said that his soul was filled  with rejoicing to see the beauty &amp; harmony of the family  connecting links of the Priesthood that had been taught  this day: And when I look at the family connexion  I cannot but acknowledge him my leader in all things  &amp; he looking to Joseph the Martered Prophet who has gone  to prepare the way for us, and can do more for us than  he could do if he was here. This Pristhood spoken off  if from all Eternity &amp; will lead to eternity &amp; will exhalt  the Saints to be Gods through faithfulness.    law of adoption granted the brethren the privilege of asking  questions when they did not fully comprehend his meaning The Lord introduced the law of adoption for the benefit of the  children of men as a school master to bring them back into the  covenant of the Priesthood. This Principle I am aware is  not clearly understood by many of the Elders in this Church  at the present time as it will here after be: And I confess that  I have had ownly a smattering of those things but when it  is necessary I will attain to more knowledge on the subject  &amp; consequently will be enabled to teach &amp; practice more and will in the mean time glorify God the bountiful giver. I have heard Elders say they were not dependant upon any  man, I then considerd &amp; do now that it was saying more  than I can say, for I consider that we are all dependant  one upon another for our exhaltation &amp; that our interest is inseperably connected. (for example) what can my family do without me supposing they were to all turn away from me I hold the Keys over them through which they are to receive there exhaltation. would they  a shepherd &amp; would be devoured by the wolves, they certainly  would. then let us change the position, &amp; say that I would  cut off all my family, then what glory would I have with no body to rule over but my own dear little self. To tell you my feelings  I would rather be annihilated than to be in that situation. This is another strong proof of the Apostles saying when they declaired  that they without us could not be made perfect. Neither can  you without me nor I without you be made perfect  are faithful &amp; without faithfulness there is no perfection on any  consideration. This rule applyes to the whole human family.  This is the torment &amp; misery of the disobedient spirits that they  cannot be made perfect, unless some scheme should hereafter  be introduced for their redemption. they are now without tabernacles  to dwell in ownly such as they have taken possession off unlawfully  page torn usurped power over. it being a part of their agency that was  page torn bestowed them which they used to the consumation of there unhappy  page torn wretched estate, it being the reward &amp; fruits of there doings   ENDENTRY  itted to afflict the handy work of the Lord untill they fill up the cup of their iniquity &amp; the Lord sayeth unto  them thou wicked &amp; disobedient spirit thou shalt not have  power any longer to afflict my people or destroy the  works of my hands, you have forfeited your agency &amp;  wrought thy fulness, depart hence to the pit that I have  prepared for thee, &amp; this is there torment, that the &amp; agency is taken away. they are left to regret that it was through their own disobediance that they cut the thread of  there own salvation: the reflections of which ownly serve to  torture &amp; increase there torment &amp; that would be the situation  of my family should they cut themselves off from me. I use  my family for an example, not that I have the least fears  of their ever doing so, for I have none. I feel happy this  night because we are of one mind, still should I believe that we  were perfect &amp; could not advance any further I should not be happy  but to the honor power &amp; glory of the faithful there is no end. For your satisfaction I will show you a rule by which you may  comprehend the exhaltation of the faithful. I will use myself  as a figure, &amp; say that I am ruling over 10 sons or subjects page torn  to them &amp; they would be ruler over them &amp; that would  make me ruler over 10 Presidents or Kings whareas I was  page torn ruler over 10 subjects ownly or in other words I ruled over one Kingdom but now I rule over  one get 10 more then I would be ruler over 100 Kingdoms &amp; so on continued to all eternity &amp; the more honor &amp; glory that I could bestow upon my sons the more it would add to my  exhaltations. but to clip the thread of your exhaltation then  whare would be  angels or devils that kept not their first esstate but were reserved in everlasting chains of darkness unto the judgment of the great  day others fell from heaven were thrust down to hell;  but if  leader &amp; boast him a head. should you have ten legions of  trains following on after you, you should say to your file leader push ahead for I am coming with my train boosting  him up at the same time instead of trying to pass by him this would stimulate him &amp; he would say come on my boys I will travel as fast as you can &amp; on we would go in  one solid train to all Eternity. Before I close I will answer  one question that has been asked me repetedly. Should I  page covered have a father dead that has never herd this gospel, would  it page covered be required of me to redeem him &amp; have him adopted to some mans family and I be adopted unto my Father  page torn mption for our dead relatives we then become their  page torn &amp; were we to wait to redeem our dead relatives before we  page torn could link the chain of the Priesthood we would never page torn accomplish it.

The Son has also a Taberna cle like the Father &amp; the Holy Ghost is a minister to the people but  not a tabernacle who begat the Son of God Infidels say that  Jesus was a Bastard but let me tell you the truth concerning  that matter. Our Father begat all the spirits that were before  any tabernacles were made when our Father came into the  Garden He came wi wifes with him &amp; eat of the fruit of the garden untill  He could beget a tabernacle and Adam is Michael or God  and all the God that we have any thing to do with they Eat  of this fruit &amp; formed the first Tabernacle that was  formed and when the   no other way ownly as we were begotton I will tell you  the Truth as it is in God. The world dont know that Jesus  Christ Our Elder Brother was begotton by our Father in Heaven  Handle it as you please it will either seal the damnation or  salvation of man He was begotton by the Father &amp; not  by the Holy Ghost.     I have told you nothing in this thing but what you have  red in the Bible I do not frame it.    the Tithing money that was due had been paid we should  have had more means the merchanets have carried away  $200,000 to the States did the people pay tithing on that No now Bishops see to this matter &amp; then see what your  feelings would be if you was in my place &amp; see the  Hundreds that call upon me &amp; my Brethren if the Tithing  was paid that is due we would have enough to pay all  debts I now say to the Bishops go to my yard &amp; take all my stok  &amp; lick all up clean then do the same by my Brethren untill  all the debt are paid All voted to follow the presidents example   ENDENTRY April 10, 1852    FIGURE Prayer by W. Woodruff President Kimball called for  Professor A Carrington but made the following remark you have learned Enough to  God will be grieved at any folly manifest in the House  of God Angels are ministering spirits to those who are heirs  of salvation but when you do wrong the Angels of the  Lord will leave and the Angels of the devil will take there  place &amp; keep their company then you are on dangerous  ground &amp; if you will not hear the prophets that God sends  unto you you would not hear the Angels of God some  have said that I was vary presumptuous to say this  Brothor Brigham was my God &amp; Sav was his God the one that gave Joseph the keys of the  kingdom was his God which was Peter Jesus Christ  was his God &amp; the God &amp; Fathe of Jesus Christ was  Adam. The Lord wants us to have wisdom to circumscribe  the Earth do you not suppose that God has pleasure in  seeing this people who are the weak things of the Earth to confound  the wise Noble &amp; great some will tell the gentiles all that  transpires among us    a few remarks    arose &amp; said I rejoice with you my Brethren in the  blessings you enjoy yes I rejoice with you. Brother Kim- ball sayes that what I say will be right. All science  that is in the world that is not consistant with reason &amp;  demonstration is false. But all that is truth is good no matter  who has it. with regard to Education we are all interested  in it yet we have different views of it. Their is three  things that are hard to speak upon 1 speech 2nd is a Temperance speech 3rd is a speech on Education I despise that vain phylosophy that  puffeth up. I do not know of any truth that does  not belong to salvation that is of worth evry thing that  is knowledge pertains to salvation we have come unto  the work and have to save ourselves our Children &amp; our  progenitors I dont know of any thing that we can do  to lay a foundation for this better than to disipline  the mind &amp; Body &amp; bring them both in subjection to  the mind &amp; will of God the ownly way we can do right is to keep the commandments of God. One of the commandments  of God require us to multiply &amp; replenish the Earth when a  young man gets married to a good young woman &amp; the  Hunny moon is over and a foundation laid for posterity  then the man begins to scold his wife the wife gets the  same spirit &amp; this goes to the child this is an Evil &amp; follows  the child through life. The Blood nurses the embrio &amp;  as the child grows the Evil increases with the child the Hunny moon should last always &amp; the Husband should  gratify the wife in all things that she righteously wishes as far as he can &amp; the mother should possess a spirit of contentment  &amp; peace at least untill the child leaves the Breast then you   ENDENTRY  in the spirits in Eternity have their times &amp; seasons  would not a Noble spirit rather take a Noble Tabernacle  than a poor one when many children are born they  cannot suck the breast because of the corruption of  their parents this is probably the fault of the Doctors  for not teaching the female as they ought to be taught  &amp; when the child is born the practice has been to give  it a Brandy tody or Chamber lie while the breast is the  place for the child let the child have the milk &amp; let let  such foolery alone dont play with the tabernacles of your  children or treat them foolishly but treat them in  wisdom you dont see any body giving a Brandy Tody or  chamber lye &amp; they do well to follow the course of nature The gentile Doctors cannot cure deseases they do not know how I will prove it to you the old school give medicine by the  shovel full. The New school will not give a pill as large  as the smallest Bird shot. is their any Equality in this I say  down with the whole system I have no use for them next  comes the Hdrapath the water cures well even water is  not to be trifled with look at the foolery &amp; the difference  of the doctors it is much better to follow out the natural law  in all things than to trust to them who would ever think of  giving such a dose to a calf as they would give a child Their is no such children as the Latter day Saints  If we cannot do what we want to our children may  if we cannot get back to the primeval platform becaus of the  still it is our duty to teach them principle &amp; truth when  children begin to talk dont teach them baby talk for  what you learn the child in that state has to be unl- earned then be careful what you say or do before  your children for you would be asstonished at the atte- ntion children pay to what you say. Be sure to take time  to teach your children &amp; not neglect it many other  interesting remarks were made by Brother Carrington on  the occasion    remarks    testimony to what Brother Carrington has said he  has spoken the truth I thank him for what he has  said what he has said is true and if we follow the testi mony we will return to the power of our first parents  his is the way for the Nations of the Earth to return  to God.

Never take  course to rob the dead I will have time to redeem  all my dead friends either in time or Eternity the Malinium will be spent in the Temples of the Lord  in Redeeming our dead if my friends will not Receive my testimony I will let them alone &amp; when they have been in Hell long enough I will go &amp; Redeem  them I will take a course to get  my seed that Adam had upon his seed Joseph had it  &amp; I have it if my children sin they will have i to  Repent of &amp; pay for it but will be saved in the End.  we should not go to law with each other all that  will not go to Law say I all said I, I would as lieves be damned without a man as to be damned  with a man that would steal a dead mans wife for  he will be damned any how. I will say that Brother Hunter is the chief Bishop &amp; he has a right to chose his two counsellors Bishop Hunter arose  &amp; made some remarks &amp; said he should choose men   ENDENTRY  was at the Head &amp; his councellors were inspired of  the Holy Ghost I select for my councellors Brigham Young &amp; Heber C Kimball. Then Brother Kimball  &amp; Hunters Head &amp; blessed him in the following words   Christ while we lay our hands upon thy head  that all our words may be dictaited by the Holy spirit  while we set apart Brother Hunter as a presiding Bishop we here by set you apart to be a presiding Bishop  &amp; to be a Judge in Israel we bless you with the spirit of your Office &amp; calling you shall have wisdom to Judge between good &amp; Evil in all things &amp; to be  a great Benefit to the House of Israel &amp; that they  may uphold thee by their faith that thou mayest  administer in in faith &amp; righteousness &amp; be a great  blessing to the people &amp; administer to the poor &amp; nedy thou shalt have desernment like the lightning to detect it evil &amp; those who seek to deceive &amp; that all may receive  thy teachings &amp; that thy work may work together for the  good of all the people even so Amen   in his office of Architect for the Church was carried   you shall be blessed &amp; all your House &amp; not one of them  shall be lost &amp; no man shall get betwen me  &amp; Brother Brigham &amp; Brothe Richards &amp; no  man or woman shall get between the Twelve  &amp; Presidency if they do they will get pinched  &amp; any man or woman that tries to get between  us will be damned they tried to prejudice Joseph against us in his day &amp; they will be damned The Twelve are the best men that live and any  man that tries to put their feet upon their neck  will get the feet of the Twelve upon their neck (Brother Brigham came in at this time) do as Br  Brigham tells you &amp; all will be right &amp; you will  not have sorrow follow my council &amp; you will  not have sorrow. If my own family would take  my council &amp; had faith in me I would never have  a doctor in my family but I have doctors here  that I have faith in but let me send for a doctor  &amp; they have faith in him &amp; not in me then what  for them am I. Brother Brigham said that is  true &amp; worthy of note it is natural for a man to be always borrowing trouble but we have trouble enough without borrowing. If you are not one you are not  mine saith the Lord but if you abide in me you will bring forth fruit to the glory of God when we  learn this lesson our sorrows will scease when we  get the cloak off we shall be in heaven In this   ENDENTRY  with Holy men &amp; Angels The Bishop with Brothe Hunter are good men. Seth Taft was appointed a travelling Bishop others were spoken off as travelling Bishops I have been talking about the union in the world their  would be a patition between the different Branches  but in the kingdom of God it is not so but they are all united.
