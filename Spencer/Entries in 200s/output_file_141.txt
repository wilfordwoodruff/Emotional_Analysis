Many have made them- selves miserable thinking they had sined against the Holy  Ghost. others that they had sined a great sin. But what  have the Revelations of the Lord said upon these subjects we learn that Jesus Christ came and took a body and redeemed the world but Lucipher rebelled was cast down without any body and He has sought to vex and destroy the children of men. He seeks diligently to draw all from the right path esspecially if a Saint  tries to follow the track and get whare Jesus was then the devil would try hard to over throw them. Many have thought they have committed much sin when they have not understood the nature and work  of sin. we must understand many principles and arive at much knowledge before we can fully understand the Nature of Sin. The veil of Darkness is over the Earth so that the inhabitants of the  Earth are so overwhelmed in tradition and darkness they do not know light from darkness truth from Error wright from wrong  or the difference between the dictation of the Holy Spirit or that conscienc which has been framed for them by the dictation of their mothers and priests. many think far more of the  traditions of their youth than of any principle that God could reveal from Heaven unto them. their Mothers must  not do any thing on Sunday ^to^ darn a stocking would be a great sin, sin is one thing and tradition is another. The word of God  revealed will tell what sin is while tradition will not The Education of the world is good as far as they have any truth found in any science which they possess but they do not  understand truth as connected with the plan of Salvation. I  want the saints here to understand that they cannot sin against  God, and Jesus Christ and the priesthood, against his family  and the Saints then come and ask forgiveness of the church then pass on smoothly and ^think they will^ go to Heaven this is to cheap a way  to get to Heaven I want this subject riveted on your hearts if it is not you will not remember it. You must remember your covenants and the Law of the Lord that is given to us. It is written  that sin is a transgression of the Law whare is it, in the Books that is given us in the main yet this does not go into all the me- anderings of life. whare do you find a law that you shall not drive a team across your Neighbor lot nor go to his hay stack or suffer your families to take liberties that you are not  willing should be done to you yet you know it to be wrong. But  do unto others as you wish others to do unto you is the Law and the prophets. Some men who have been ordained unto the priesthood  and are vary high in Authority will take the Name of God in vain and swear by this and that does such persons suppose that  that the Church can forgive that sin if you do your hope is vain they can never forgive that sin. No man can do it none   ENDENTRY But God alone and it never will be forgiven untill He does it the time will come that if a man will take the name of God  in vain he will be hewn down without judgment or trial Hear it O ye Elders, for it is time. Let this people sanctify their hearts and then take the Name of God in vain and they will not be forgiven the time will also come  when if the parents are scanctifyed before the Lord and their children rise up in disobedience against them they will be hewn down. If you sin against God and take the name  of God in vain if you get forgiveness it will have to be forgiven by Him and not from man. some think if they are alone and sware or sin nobody will know it but they will find  themselves mistaken still if a man has to sware let  him be alone if a man damns himself let him be alone that others may not be polluted by his sin. If you take  the name of God in vain I will not forgive ^it,^ for I cannot if the Lord will forgive you I will forgive you for maring my feelings by speaking it in my ears the more you  see the veil parted and the more you learn the more you will see Gods ways are not as our ways this people are passing through a great  school of experiance I remember while in Kirtland if any of the Brethren felt their rights infringed upon in any wise or abused would retaliate and be ready to quarrel about it and be ready to get up a law suit for ^a debt of^ three dollars but the minds of the saints have become more noble Now if a man is abused who understands principle he is above quar- reling about it and he feels to say it is nothing to me I am not to suffer by it but you that have abused me has the penalty to pay. But  if the devivel can ownly make you think that you are abused or  ill treated and you begin to fret about it and you give the devil power ^over^ you and in the end it is as bad as though you had done wrong yourself Now if a man sins against you untill seventy times seven and he repents  and with an humble heart asks forgiveness you should forgive him  for this is the law and the prophets He must ask forgiveness and be humble or he cannot be forgiven. As much has been said and many fears entertained by many concerning the sin against the Holy Ghost I will  speak further concerning that subject to sin against the Holy  Ghost is a sin against God the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost that  bears record of them. A man cannot sin against the Holy Ghost  untill the Holy Ghost has revealed unto him the Father and Son and a knowledge of Eternal things in a great degree degree when he has a knowledge of these things with his eyes open he  rebels against God and defys his power He sins against all things if a man does sin against the Holy Ghost the people have nothing  to do with it for they cannot forgive that sin and none but God can do it and probably He will not in this world nor the world to come for they become sons of perdition and probably will never repent of their sin or have a disposition to.   If you blaspheme the Name  of God dont ask this people to forgive you for they cannot do it you may ask them to pray God to forgive you. If God does forgive the sin then you can go down into the waters of baptism when you get knowledge you will be ashamed to sin   Now I want to bring this subject home what are the acts of the people do they not sin and trespass against their Brethren Parrents against  their children and children against their parents the husband against  the wife and wife against the husband this is with us and this we   ENDENTRY can reach and manage and tell what ought to be done you ought to cease from taking the liberty of any person but do unto all as you would wish them to do unto you infringe upon the rights of no one Borrow no tool but what you will return according to promise take no wood nor any thing els but what belongs to you and if you  find any thing that is not your own do not hide it away but  report it that the owner may be found. If I had some stones here in my hand I could cast them and hit twor or three in this congregation in the head who are guilty of these acts you may say  why dont you tell who they are why you poor Devil are you not going to repent of it by and by. If not when the day of clensing and santi fying of Israels comes you will have to be sacraficed and your blood spilt upon the ground for the day will come when iniquity must scease in Zion and the Profane man who takes the Name of God in vain will be slain.   In the days of Ancient Israel Justice was dealt out in a manner that showed they understood principle and revered the commands of God. it was a mercy to many to have Justice and Judgment executed upon them on the Earth even to be slain and have their blood poured out upon the Earth that it  might be tolerable for them God made a Covenant with Abraham and his seed that He would save them when they commit sin He slew them that He might save them by  their spilling their blood as an offering. Had they have lived in sin they might have sinned so as not to have been forgiven or saved. it was a mercy to slay them. Now Brethren if  you sin against God go to God to get forgiveness if that sin is not unto death their is a sin unto death which we were told we need not pray for. if you sin against your Brother go to him  to get forgivness ask forgiveness at the hands of the inocent if you sin against your family your parents your husband your  wife your childrn seek forgiveness at their hands but what is done in secret should be forgiven in secret and go no further that sins may be hid. But if sins are committed openly they should ask forgiveness and be forgiven openly these are true principles and let them be rememberd forever   Govornor B. Youngs address before the legislative assembly of the Territory of Utah upon slavery He remarked that the whole world were slaves Eve partook of the forbidden fruit and also Adam and it brought slavery  upon all their posteriy in some way or other and this will continue untill we become righteous enough to drive  the devil and evil from the Earth. Adam had two  sons Kane and Abel. KCain was more given to evil than  Abel Adam was called to offer secrifice also his sons the  sacrifice of Abel was more acceptable than Canes and Cane took it into his heart to put Abel out of the way so he  killed Abel the Lord said I will not kill Cane but I will put a mark upon him and it is seen in the face of every Negro on the Earth and it is the decree of God that that mark shall remain upon the seed of Cane and the Curse untill all the seed of Abel should be redeemed and Cane will not receive the priesthood untill or  salvation untill all the seed of Abel are redeemed any man having one drop of the seed of Cane in him   ENDENTRY in him cannot hold the priesthood and if no  other Prothet ever spake it before I will say it now in the name of Jesus Christ I know it is true and they know it the Negro cannot hold one particle of Government but the day will come when all the seed of Cane will be Redeemed and have all the blessings we have now and a great deal more but the seed of Abel will be ahead of the seed of Cane to all Eternity let me consent to day to mingle my seed with the seed of Cane it would bring the same curse upon me and it would upon any man and if any man mingl his seed with the seed of Cane the ownly way he could get red of it or have salvation would be to come forward  and have his head cut off and spill his blood upon the ground it would also take the life of his Children It is said if a man kills another that he takes that that he cannot give if a mans head is cut off his life is not destroyed or his  spirit that lives, his tabernacle is destroyed but I can make as good tabernacles as I can destroy if you do not believe it look at my Children. Much blood was  shed in ancient days both of man and beast the firstlings and best of the flock was sacrafized on the Altar and in  some instances many men and almost whole Nations was sacraficed or put to death because of their sins and wickednes this was the ownly way they could be saved at all if Jesus Christ had not had his blood shed the blood that He received from his Mother Mary the world  would not have been saved. Their is not one of the seed of old Cane that is permitted to rule and reign over  the seed of Abel and you nor I cannot help it Those that do bear rule should do it in righteousness I am opposed to the present system of slavery the Negro should serve the seed of Abram but it should be done right dont abuse the Negro and treat him cruel. It has been argued here that many of  the Jews were Judah  mingled with the seed of Cane they lost their priesthood and all blessings. as an ensample let the  Presidency, Twelve, Seventies, High Priest Bishops and all the Authorities say now We will all go and mingle witth the seed of Cane and they may have all the privileg they want we lift our hands to heaven in support of  this that moment we loose the pristhood and all blessings and we would not be redeemed untill Cane was. I  will never admit of it for a moment some may think I dont know as much as they do but I know that I know more than they do. the Lord will watch us all the time the Devil would like to rule part of the time but I am  determin He shall not rule at all and Negros shall  not rule us. I will not admit of the Devil ruling at  all I will not consent for the seed of Cane to  vote for me or my Brethren if you want to know why we did not speak of it in the Constitution  it was because it was none of their business   ENDENTRY any man is a Citizens Black white or red and if the Jews come here with a part of the Canaanite blood in them they are Citizens and shall have their rights but not to rule for me or my Brethren those persons from the Islands and foreign countries know nothing about governing the people. The Canaan ite cannot have wisdom to do things as the white man has. We must guard against all Evil I am not going to let this people damn themselves as long as I can  help it    ENDENTRY February 8, 1852 ~ Sunday   Sunday Feb 8 President Young addressed the assembly  and said I trust in the Lord for light as I have  heretofore done when the minds of men are open  to understand they will see things as they are. we are subject to all the evils which are in the world. I have thought this world as fallen as any of the creations  of God. when the Lord created the Earth or any world  if they have an Exaltation they will have to experine  all that we Experiane I see no reason why they  should not be tempted as we are tempted. If we are candidates to exhaltation and glory and that we cann ot get that Exaltations and glory in no other way then we should be reconciled to it and be satisfyed to let the Lord do with us as He pleases is their any Evil upon any pe person or affliction upon any Nation or kingdom  that God does not permit their is not we should then be faithful to God in all things to be his  secret counsellor if necessary why should we com- plain or find fault with God about any thing we  should not. Se the Example of the Nations of the Earth they complain about evry thing and against all his providences their is no proceding of ours or act or ex periance but what He knows all about. If it would be any satisfaction to you I would say that God has passed through all the trials and experience that we have Jesus Christ has passed through all the trials and experine the same as we have it would not be prudent for me to say that the Father has not the same experiene that his Son had. He had quite as much as his Son had, let the Saints look about themselves and se if they hadve as great things as they expected when they first received the gospel and the Holy Ghost opened their minds they saw that Zion was to be built up and  Israel gatherd the power of God and the Holy Ghost to be poured out upon us. If we could get a place by ourseles how faithful we would live and thank God. Do you have  the same things you looked for well I dont know you say this shows that somebody has let down their watch and inf- luenced others and they have not lived up to their privileges when we first received the gospel we were humble but since the tempteor has come and we are tempted with many things but this is right the Lord permits it we could not get glory without it let me ask if any   ENDENTRY one is here who went to Jackson County in 1831  The feeling was If I could get with the Saints all  my sorrow and trouble would be at an End so it is  with the Saints in England. Before we preached  the gathering to them the lord revealed to them that  they would be gathered we told them not to reveal  it untill the time came do you have any thing now  that you looked for in the begining if not sumthing is  the matter you dont do right you dont settle this  difficulty or that but what is the matter you are wrog  yourself what henders you from praying all day and  fasting and prayer you have enough to eat but the  great difficulty is when they moved to Zion they  brought themselves with them you had so many devels  in you that they trouble you. when the devel and wicked  men have afflicted and persecuted us as far as is for our  good then the Lord says stop and go no further they are held  up but if we take evry thing patiently all our afflictions will work together for our good. But do you at the present  time have any thing to mar your peace except what you  bring upon yourselves you have privileges here but do  the people prize their privileges why do the people go to  the kanyons after wood on Sunday why have they gone  today why dont I do it why do I not visit my farm  the Bath House on Sunday because it is not right and sets  a bad example I cannot do these things on the  Sabbath Some will take poles off from his Neighbors farm  take a chain or an ax without liberty this is wrong their is nothing on Earth to mar our peace but owur  own acts but the great difficulty is they cannot get away from themselves. they think perhaps if they  go to the gold digings they can get away from themselves but they cannot. When persecution and trials come  they search the good seed and it dries up. How are you  going to get Zion nothing henders our having Zions  but ourselves we have all the privileges of Angels to  worship God and get all blessings we need. we mean  to war with all Devils temptations and trials untill we  overcome I will fight untill I overcome if I fall  in the grave their is others who will take my place their are many who will fight and if it needs be we will take the sword I hope all who want good principles  will have the privilege of receiveing them to day is a day of  tithing and sacrafice tomorrow cometh the burning I would say  that you cannot be perfect without me nor I without you  the providences of God has so interwoven and identifyed  the interest of the Children of Adam together that they  cannot be perfect without each other do you enjoy your- selves and have peace. I have peace and no man can take it frm  me if you do not have peace it is because you drive stakes  and the Lord will not let you do it but let the will of God  be done if you dont Enjoy Zion it is because you dont say  let the will of God be done their is nothing to take your  Zion away but yourselves we are to be tryed and tempted   ENDENTRY in evry way in order to prove ourselves the friend of God  in all things and God will bless you my prayer is that God will bless this people and that they may be faithful and  a friend to God.

The diedication Prayer was offered by Willard Richards it was great and good is published in  the Deserett News then two Hyns were sung. The Prsidt dent I arise to say a few words as we have offered the dedi cation Prayer upon that subject who could foresee  the way of the Lord as we now See it we can now beho- ld the manifestation of the Lord. He has done what we  could not have expected but we have an experience  that teaches us to trust in the Lord. we should not  undertake to dictate the Lord for his work will go on  we have seen plenty try to dictate the Lord and try to build up  themselves and not this kingdom but they soon fall and the Lord  overthrows them but this work goes on the gospel is preached  and all his work goes on let the wicked do what they please we have the privilege of worshiping God and being happy. I wish to  dedicate all I possess unto God and praise him and do all He requires  of me. At the last conference I was sick and not able to be  with you not able to be up I meditated upon the state of the   ENDENTRY Church. I see some going to the right some to the left some after gold and the riches of this life I said I would tell the Brethren my feelings I said I would go to work and  build a Tabernacle and worship the Lord so that we would not be driven home by a storm I saw also that some would say I cannot go for I must take care of my cattle my farm my fields andc but I said I would go and worship God as long as I wished If the whole Earth sunk. Some delight in a fine Horse farm or House or good things ofin this life but this is nothing to  you it is good in its place. But you cannot pray because you cannot spend time. some women cannot spend time to have prayers you know it is your duty to pray and dedicate yourselves to God and your family and all you possess some feel as though they must go to night to the canyons. But if you will harken to council you will say to all the world Stand By I am going to worship the Lord let the dead Bury the dead and dedicate myself and family and all I have to the Lord. No matter whather the Lord sets you about go at it and do it. Their is a great change with  this people we have been sick now are well have been  poor now are rich, Have been distressed and mobed now have peace How long will it last as long as this people  do right It has been 22 years since this Church was  organized we should serve the Lord Love the Lord with  all our hearts scease to do wrong or find fault with any of the Saints if they do wrong Chastize them and not  hate them. are the people prepared to make a covenat to dedicate themselves and their hearts to God from  this hour I feel to urge all the Brethrn and Sisters to dedicate themselves unto the Lord. If we can  gain the victory and say I will do the work of the Lord in all things. If He will make his will known I will perform it. Not ownly say but perform it dedicate our our affections unto the Lord. we may find some that cannot feel it, they say I want some gold or somthing to help myself with to get out of difficulty what will  be done in such a case, I will tell you what I would do If I had got but one cow and she plagued me I would give her away if you have any thing that is in your way  give it away to the public works Let nothing get between you and God and I will tell you what to do if any thing  gets between you and God give it to the service of God for you cannot get through the gate of the Celestial City why are you not as pure as the Church of Enoch because you are not a mind to be I will make my hands do the will of God and my heart will go with it. The spirit of Envy will not obey then unite your interest with this kingdom for this kingdom will stand forever then put your inter est with it so that you cannot get away then you will stick to the kingdom but if your purse of gold is in your pocket and you Apostitize you will go away but if your interest is in the church and you do wrong you may stay untill you get  the spirit of God again and may be saved we must build   ENDENTRY up this kingdom first and dont be afraid of Starveing for  this kingdom will be an ever lasting Kingdom that will not be throne down it will Stand forever the more the wicked try to throw it down the more it will stand if you want it to stand unite your interest with it  in such a manner that you cannot get it away then you are safe if I was to ask what your opinion was concerning the Millenuam I should get a  great many opinions but the truth is all will be in one sens as it is now you will eat, build, and  do all things as now ownly you will be more pure and united and all will serve the Lord and not the devil  any more let this people possess this spirit and Here would be the Millenium it would be with any people that would do that the President then blessed the people and asked God to bless them they then sung an hym and adjourned till 2 oclok   2 oclok PM. The House was crouded to excess O Pratt of the Twelve Apostles addressed the Assembly (after singing and prayer) He said I address you but not without many reflections upon my mind. It is no small matter to address such a sea of faces if the Lord does not pour out his spirit upon me it will not be but a little benefit for me to speak yet I do feel a great desire for the Lord to give me his spirit for your sake that you may be edifyed I feel anxious to receive principle and the salvation of the living and dead what has  that to do with the living it has much to do with it it is a truth revealed from Heaven that we are to be saviors upon Mount Zion to redeem the living and the dead this is the subject that is given to me I am determined to trust in God who will give any man their portion in  due season the responsibility of preaching this gospel  to all the world and redeem the dead we must live before  the Lord in such a manner that we can have his appro- bation what says the Book of Mormon upon this subject those that assist in building up Zion and shall do it by faith shall have the blessing of the Lord upon them How will we  do it by listening to the council of the priesthood of the Church and consecrating ourselves before God to his service as we were told by Presidet Young we shall then have  the power of the Holy Ghost and what greater gift can we  have then this for this will teach us all things and if a faithful man is sent abroad to any Nation to preach the Gospel and is faithful and follows the spirit of truth He will accom plish his mission in spite of all Earth and Hell. when Nephi was sent back to get the plates of Brass and his brethren would not go the Lord told Nephi that He was stro nger than 10,000 men to go and He would deliver the plates into his hands he went and done as the Lord told him and got the plates look at this people our enemies told us we must go away to the west and not stay with them untill we were driven into the Rocky Mountains but the Hand of the Lord was in it and the Leaders of this people were as much inspired to  come to this place as the Nephits wer to get the plates   ENDENTRY we can see that the Lord caused us to accomplish  what we could not have done we see today a great mass of Saints before us we have been sustained by the Hand of God in all thes things. The Lord hath said I will give you an inheritance that you shall have in time and Eternity and Israel shall be led by the keys which I have given we have been led into a goodly land with our good Houses and fields of grain and all good things so their is Hardly room  enough to receive it can it be possible that any man  after seeing all the goodness of God up to this time  can have a doubt about this work being true can you  find a people that has got wisdom enough to get a revela- tion for themselves unless God is with them this people are willing to do all things as far as they understand the Mormons  are increasing and will incres and their is no power that will stop the work of the Latter Day Saints. I rejoiced this  forenoon while looking upon the faces of the saints and to see the spirit of God upon them and that their union was increasing and that they wished to hear and learn truth He refered to a certain Revelation that said that Zion should look upward and their Union be incresed and was strengthened then Zion should look down from above  refering to the Zion of Enoch And that Zion would come  and the Heavens would shake with gladness and the Earth would tremble with gladness and they will build up each other I want to see that day come that we may see the Old Jerrus alem Jentlemnt Adam this people will then look but small in comparison to what will be at that time. Here are the Twelve and seventies and thousands who will bring the gospel  to all men and Israel who are numerous will have to have the feelings all manifested to them they must be visited and instructed as we have been they must be gathered  as we have been we cannot be perfect without them no more than they can be perfect without us they all must be gathered from the fore quarters of the Earth and be instructed together and be prepared for  the coming of the Lord is there not a prospet of this being done yes their is as much I wish you could have a view of the state of affairs in England their was some 40,000 saints baptized when I left and there was not one in 400 but what would give  all they possessed ion Earth to be set down here many of them would be faithful if they were here again would not the saints of the western Islands be glad to come here they would and they will come you remember  the parable of the vineyard that the servants of the Lord  had to labour and keep the top and roots Equal so that the top need not be to heavy for the roots if we can get a  few thousands of the Saints that we can teach and instruct so that they will become strong in faith and works then we wan bring in thousand of weaker ones and they get tried  the strong ones can succor them and they become strong also and the Devil have No power over them and Zion will soon  be Esstablished and thousands upon thousands will come from the Nations to take shelter under the tree of Liberty in the gospel and kingdom of God from the dire calaminities of   ENDENTRY of famine Pestilence and wars which will be poured out upon the whole Earth there is sumthing els to be done to prepare  this people for coming Events Here are many of the remnant of Joseph that have got to be felt after and redeemed I believe the signs of the times indicate that that the time has come when  the work must commence if they are sunk in the lowest depths of degredation yet they are the chosen seed the desendants of Joseph who was sold into Egypt the promises are unto  them they must be redeemed could we be placed in a better condition to commence the work than we Now are we cannot look what way we will they are all around us and the prom- ises of God are to be fulfilled then shall we not pray for them let us exercise faith in their behalf and do all we can  for them. No you not they are to be the main instrumts that will build up Zion and Her Temples and all the Gentiles who repent shall assist the remnant of Jacob to build up Zion and the power of Heaven will come down to Help them. First we are to introduce the gospel to them and teach them the principles of the Kingdom of God and give them the prie- sthood. Do you want to see the Zion of God built up and the  Temple of the Lord reared up in this Generation upon the conse- crated land then pray for the remnets of Joseph and their  redemption for they have to assist in gathering all the House of Joseph and when they all get together the Heavens can no longer be stayed but their prayers and faith will prevail and the Heavens will come down and meet with the Saints then be ready ye Elders of Israel to go when the Lord calls  upon you by his servants to leave all to go to preach the gospel to them in their own language and tongue and the power of God will rest upon you I believe the Lord  will send forth his messengers who are ordained unto this power to go forth unto the Lamanites and will clothe them with far greater power than when they were sent unto the  corrupt Gentiles the Lord will not come untill we go to  this people we have a portion of the power of God with us but not in its fulness as it will be in days to come this people will have to be tried in all things and proven and whn they are found faithful and united they will then thrash the  Nations by the power of the spirit of God and they cannot Help themselves   Orson Spencer then arose and made a few remarks. Felt to rejoice in the principle that had  been presented to us they had cheered his heart and the Hearts of this people I hope we shall improve and be faithful for these principle are true The Lord says my people shall be willing in the day of my power that people who have givn the war hoop and crept through the brush find the spirit of God and of their Father Jacob once more running through their veins and the people who think they are almost extinguished will find they are still alive and will fulfill all that is said concerning them. But I must say nothing I must  Hush. I will Hush. But will God Hush and be still No He will stir up the remnants of Joseph in his our  and in his own time. The Nations of the Earth are trying to bond together they may do so and be prepared for the day of burning the child will be taken care of untill He can take care of   ENDENTRY Himself we are on the stage of action and we have our part  to act in this great work and I rejoice that we have a prt  in the work and that it may roll on spedily is my Prayer    ENDENTRY April 7, 1852 ~ Wednesday   April 7th House filled at an Early hour to overflowing  conference opened at 10 ock.

Presidnt  Youg remarked that No doubt before you get home you will  hear we have committed treason.   with regard to the labour of this Tabernacle I will say the  cost will be read before the meeting and all the Tithing and outlay  but if you feel that if your Expectations are realized you should  be satisfyed I will say I never saw No one room as convenient  as this it will seat 2200 persons and their was is 2500 persons prst present  today. I expect the Tabernacle which we expet to build on this Block will seat fifteen Thousand people we never did  build a House large Enough to Hold the people if we was to illegible  this whole 10 Acre Block so that it would hold 200,000 people  by the time we got it done their would be enogh to fill it. The  Lord is controlling our affairs and does more for us than we can   ENDENTRY do for ourselves or ask him to do for us the more we are  humble and labour and prepare for the gathering of Israel the faster  they will gather the Esstablishment of this Tabernacle was  the result of my meditations while upon a sick bed   If their is any man that is full of the Holy Ghost and wishes to  speak let him rise up and speak and use his liberty I feel as  usual to praise the Lord with all my heart. The hand of  God has been as visable in leading this people as it was in  leading Israel in the days of Moses some had not faith to come  on for fear of Starveing to death. dont be in a Hurry to go away but stay untill you have worshiped Enough at this time   Brother Kempton spoke a few moments believed this to be  the kingdom of God had No Doubt of it   Presidnt Young remarked that the Gentile would take exception  to what is said Here I know as the Lord lives that the people  of the United States have departed from the spirit and letter  of their Constitution and this people will be the ownly  the people that will sustain ^it^   G A Smith arose and said we are a singular people if we  signify that we cannot worship as other Sects do but want  to exercise our rights it is considered Treason but a  Senator from South Caralinia could rise up in the Halls  of Congress and declare that that the United States was more  tyranical than the Goverment of Austria and South Carolina  would reject the Goverment this would not be considered  treason but dont be alarmed God rules our destiny  and will rule the world and if we do our dooty their is no  power that can harm us for we will make God our ref uge   Br Gifford spoke a few moments and bore testimony of the  work of God Had Been in the Church 21 years in June next    Wm W Phelps next followed said this was the third  time He had been to a Dedication of a House built to worship  God I was at Kirtland while the Angel of the Lord came in  and sat there During service. A Hymn was sung and adjned  till 2 ock   Met according to adjoument singing and Prayer. The President  then Said we shall now lay before the Conference the manifesto  of the Recepts and Expenditures of the Tithing from Oct 1848  to March 27th 1852   Amount Received in cash $28950.00   In Produce $90310.803   In Horses Mules Cattle andc 23515.45   In Houses Lots Lands and wggons 66546.21   In Labour 35445.04   $244747.03   Profits on Store goods 17711.70   Goods Bought not yet paid for 42372.43   Loaned Cash not Paid 17731.17   ENDENTRY Expenditures   Council House $45833.00    $2000.00   Store and Store House $50000.00    $3000.00   Livingston store 8000.00   Wm Store 4650.00   Old Bowery and Removing 3500.00   Blacksmith Shop 3500.00   Tabernacle 18500   Bath House 6600   Mint andc 3500   Making fencees 5000   1st Church farm 15000   1000   Paid for City Lots 15655.97    1630    4500   Deserett Potery 7200   New Office 500   College 1123   4000   2500   Services of Tithing office Clerks   83883.35   11739.06   6000   Houses built 12462.34   3500   Cost of Hay fed to Horses 500   Teams and Provisions for Iron Co 3000   1750   7000   400   375   525   Total of All $353765.69   Yet to be accounted for 36495.12   Property on Hand 74550.04   Many remarks was  made by the Recorder  which are not here incerted explanaton of the same  Those figures with No explanation opposite  was lost in reporting or not put down   Presidet Young remarked for my own satisfaction and great  consolation there has not one Dollar gone into the hands of a Lawyier as in the days of Joseph at that time almst  evry dollar had to go into the hands of the Lawyiers they prosecuted him all the day long. But I said I would  kill any man that sought to take me many thought my purse reached from Eternity to Eternity that there was  No End. we were Called bogus makers Brother Kimball  said we would go whare we could coin the pure gold $10  at a lick we have done so even $20 at a time Our Brethen  went to Calafornia the Hand of God was in all this they opened the gold mines and the Lord had a Design in it to see who  would be tryed by it. Never did nor never will any of the  saints go to dig gold ther without being sent without being damned by it mark my words if we go onto the devils ground we shall  be left to smell Hell we shall feel the wrath of God if I was  sent there by the Lord I would go but the Lord has not called   ENDENTRY me to go many Elders in Israel good men have tryed  it and smutted themselves up so that it is quite a question if  they will ever be washed clean I have said I did not think  their was $1 in $20 paid in Tithing that has been spent  on the public works but it seems from the Book that  there has been about one fourth the other three fourths  I have had to borrow. If I have to borrow all the  money that is used and none assist me to pay it it will  make my head ake I have trusted the Lord and served him  all the day long and when I undertake any thing I persevere untill I accomplish it I see the difference betwen trusting in God and doing business according to the order of the world their is not one hair droped from my head unnoticed  and does God not know what I want. their never was a  miracle ownly to the Ignorant. It is all to be accounted for  on Natural principles. The Lord will not turn stone and clay  into gold to suit me their is enough without it Jesus did not make  bread out of stone but He had knowledge and power and did call togethe the Elements to make bread and the Elements into the water to make  wine and he can call the Elements together to make gold as well  as bread and wine. But the Lord is not going to work a miracle to cloth us raise your wool and flax and spin and weave it andmake it up and not  have to pay cash for evry pound you use and what you by is hardly worth making up but what you make is strong and will wear   Brother Major spoke on Home manufacture a few momets   Wednesday Evng    The Elders filled the House at an Early Hour and was addressed by  President B. Young who arose and said this is certainly a mixed  congregation of all the Officers of the Church we are to be instruct ed in all things. the knowledge that is now in the midst of this people is  more than in all the world besides. All sceince is in the midst of this people even if they have not learned it as the world has. I have  my cogitations and views of the affairs of this kingdom but I have  learned that we must write work to the scribe if not we may  fail in it but if we work in faith and confidence the Lord is  apt to Help us. I asked a favor of the Bishops to divide the money  debts in Each ward, that it might be paid. Let us contend with ourselves and disipline ourselves untill evry thing that is within us is brought in subjection to the Law of Christ you have been taught the first principles of the gospel now teach yourselves and  the Church. Our school is the school of the prophets this is a school  to plain and polish ourselves and suppose under such privilege we  should endulge in Evil and neglect our families and our duty to God all our former sins would be upon our Heads it is for a man  to commit himself and all that He presides over unto God to do his will  and continue to do it untill you are sanctifyed. if your Neighbor  does you Evil do not do evil to them bear with him and set him  right but do not quarrel with him but be careful that you  conduct yourself well untill you are prepared for the society of Holy  men this is as I said the school of the Prophets Our Baptism is  ownly the begining of our work you must then go on to perfection you must perform this work our children understand the gospel  but do they understand the way to govern their lives we will never  se a day but what we can learn we shall not inherit the glory of  God all at once or understand all knowlede but God teaches us small  principles to prepare us for greater ones Let us learn in this school ENDENTRY there is a great many Books of Education of the present day the main  main Branch of our study is Theology I understand it better than  any of the world. Adam, Enoch, Moses and Aaron, Jesus and the Apostle have all been in the same school in their day and have faithfuly lernd  that they might be perfected. They are my Brethren and will be my  company and I now tell you if you want me to have full fellowsip with you scease speking Evil of God and all good men whether in  Heaven or on Earth.   When a man is in the right tract he will come and lay down any thing at the feet of a Brother to settle a difficulty  and rather wrong themselves than to have a difficulty do for the truth sake and my sake take my councel. The people want revelating this is  Revelation FIGURES If you wanted Revelation written I could  write Revelation evry day about Building a Temple diging gold going  to England or any othe place I profess to be an Apostle Evry Apostle  will have to be a Revelator and have Revelations if their is thousands of then if they do their duty and live up to thei calling if not they will  have to be removed but a man that is not an Appostle has  not power to stand at the Head of the Kingdom of God Hold the keys of  the priesthood and build up and lead the church of God the Highest Authory  on the Earth is an Apostle   Jesus Christ will have a set of men By Young said with him that will follow him to the end  and to all that He requirs of them they will have the greater glory but those that cannot endure these things will have a Lesser glory   G. A. Smith followed and said I want to bear my testimony  to the saints Many want a mission but let me tell you that any man who has been baptized into this kingdom that moment he  took a mission whill will contine untill death before it closes if we do not work in all things agreeable to the Council of the Church it  would not be right talk of paying one tenth and buying our way to Heaven Brother Joseph wished the Seventies to subscribe as much as as a gimbl and handle to build up the Seventies Hall if Brothr Joseph Young had the  right spirit he would not ask for such subscriptions if the Elders was as ready to build that Hall as they would be to go on a missin  they would rise up and do it right off and the quicker you commence to build the quicker it will be finished and such a Hall will be worth  5 times the amount of personal property make your large farms large  large Houses and Have spare Rooms and neglect public Building it would be  a loss you may work yourself almost to death and then be  called away at a momets warning I was called to go to Iron  County. Some Elders that was called to go on that Mission sent  gold diggers to go in their place and fill the mission for them I  never thought of leaveing a mission that was given me untill  that mission was closhed closed up many worked all winter to build and put in grain then Left it in the spring and go home. Our  Mormon News is our paper. we should sustain it. we are neglecting the Education of our Children. knowledge is power the Lord will  help those who help themselves. the English by the knowledge they possessed  conquered 200,000000 of people and brought them in subjection to there own Laws what we learn we shall carry with him us the mobs  will burn our homes and destroyed our property but they cannot  burn or destroy the knowlede of our hearts. we should keep  the Sabbath it is not right to spend this day in Hunting cattle and labouring but should spend the time in the worship of God and we should improve each leasure momet in treasureing up knowledge if we   ENDENTRY could lay up one Idea each day for a year we should have a  store of knowledge that no man could exhaust in a speech of three  hours in length and the wicked could not stand before you. the  most learned man of the day is Burrett A Blacksmith He was a  self learned and made man pay attention to this Brethn and improve you  by it we now have the privilege of speaking in one of the Best Halls  in the world thak God Amen Zera Pulsipher spoke and bore testimy of the work    ENDENTRY April 8, 1852 ~ Thursday   Thursday 8th House filled at 9 oclok Meeting opened by Prayer  by Wilford Woodruff who also addressed the Assembly spoke in  sum measure upon the subjet of Education He said we are comm- issioned to preach the gospel to all the world and stand before kings and  rulers it is our duty to store our minds with knowledge learning  and wisdom that we may be qualifyed to stand before all men the Lord  has called upon this people and ordained them to preach the gospel and make war  upon the powers of darkness and continue that warfare untill the Earth is  redeemed and the name of God honored among men who should spend all  of his life in preaching the gospel and should ownly bring in one man into the kingdo  of God who should be saved with an Everlasting salvation that man would have  cause to rejoice through all Eternity over the redemption of that one  Soul and if He brings ^m^any souls into the kingdom of God His Joy will be still  greater. The warfare of the saints is great in the Earth in this dispensa tion and we should all take hold of it with a determination to conquer  and never scease untill our warfare is accomplished and evry man  will be satisfyed with his reward in the End. many other remarks  were made by the speaker who soon gave way for Orson Spencer  the chancellor of the Deseret University who delivered an address upon  Education   Orson Spencer Delivered an address upon the subject  of Education which he read from his manuscript which I suppos  will be published in the Deseret News so I did not report it   Judge Z Snow made a few remarks and said if a woman was an Educated  and Exalted minded persons she would teach good principles to her  children A person without any Education would be as ignorant as  the unborn child for whatever knowledge a person did possess he got  it by some kind of Education. Some think that Education consists  soleley in teaching Elementary Braches it may consist in farming or  any persuit of life. We have got to create all we have out of the  Elemets aroud us and we want to learn how to do it we  must manufactur all we use for if we get any thing from  the States we will have to pay High for it. if not bring us into  Slavery by it therefore we must lay a plan to beat our Enemies  or they will beat us   W W Phelps followed with some remarks   President Young next followed and said the subject I aim  at is to Enlighten the mind it is expected we have to learn  letters with regard to the principle of Education it commen ces with the mothers I do not like to see Mothers attend to every  thing Els but their children they should teach their children  all they can for Early impressionn will last persons throgh  life whether they be good or bad I will tel you the truth as it  is in Eternity if the child does not have good instruction  in Early life it will be required at the Hand of the Mother  and not at the hand of the Mother ^Father^   ENDENTRY the Child will think the mother is the best woman on Earth  and the mother has power to instill into the mind of the child  what they please, and what the Mother imparts unto them will  stay with them through life the Mother should take care of the  children and not spend their time watching the Husband  it is the duty of Mothers to Stay at home and take care of the  children. My duty calls me to be in this Stand I know not  what my children are about or what they are doing they may  be in the Streets swareing what I know as others do if they  should go to Hell it would be required at the Hands of the  Mother and not at my hands A Child of mine shall not  conquer me I would sooner see them die than that they  should conquer me. If any one of my Children will  not follow my footsteps I will disinherit and disown them  they shall not have part in my kingdom I would rather  get children adopted to me that will keep the command ments. No child should rise up and teach and controll the Mother  Or woman should ^not^ rise up and dictate the Husband and the Husband  should not rise up and try to dictate His president or the Lord In speaking of the English Language he said it was vary  incorrect He would not adopt it any more than he would the  Methodist disipline.   Education begins with the Mother to  the Child you must keep it in rememberane that the Lord  has commanded you to multiply and replenish the Earth  that you may have Joy and rejoiceing in the day of the Holy  Resurrection do you keep your minds pure and do you prey  night and day now pray from the time of conception till  the time of Delivery that your child may be filled with  FIGURE the Holy Ghost and that a Noble Spirit from Eternity  may come into the tabernacle and that the Holy Ghost  may rest upon the Father Mother and child often when  some speak you cannot understand they make use of such  High flown words but when I speak you can understand  for I speak to you understanding. the variety in the English  Language I would like to be with the Holy Ones who are  full of Eternal light. A point of the finger or motion  would communicate without words when I am full  of the Holy Ghost I can se a man as well behind me as before I can see their hearts by the spirit of God and know  what is in them. Adjourned till 1 oclok   Met according to adjournet at 1 oclok President Young arose and  said red a Hymn which was sung. Prayer offered   H. C. Kimball then arose and said I wish to speak to the underst andings of the people I never saw any room like this on Earth the cock pit in Preston is some like it I am satisfyed that We  cannot build fast Enough to accomodate the People. Presidet  Young teachings are sweeter than the best morsel I ever tasted if we are faithful in keeping the commandmts of God you will never  fall in battle but will be preserved to finish your work on Earth  Other intersting remaks were made by Brother kimball. Volenteers  were then kalled for to go with their teams to meet the Emigrats  100 was kalled for 88 names were taken who volunteered.  Some men were then appointed to go on Foreign Missions  as follows   ENDENTRY T B, Bube Broderick  George Parmon to the  nations Edward Stephen son to Giberalter. Scotland  Alfred A Smith go on a Foreign Mission. Meeting was then Adjned  so the 70 could have the Room at 4 ock   The Seventies held a meeting and was addressed By Joseph Young  G. A. Smith W Woodruff and others concerning buildings the 70 Halls  and other matters    ENDENTRY April 9, 1852 ~ Friday   Friday 9th snow storm in the morning House  Filled and meeting commened at 9 oclok After Prayer the people  were addresed By Phineas Young who exhorted the people and spoke  many good things   President Brigham Young said this people  are blessed with all that Heart can wish and yet many are not satisfyed this is the case with smome some spirits and they  want things illegally but is it not necessary that we should  have a Temple it is absolutely necessary that we should have a  Temple to worship the Most High God in. A Tabernacle is to  assemble the Multitude for meetings but a Temple is to gather the  priesthood in that they may do the work of the Lord are  we prepared to go and redeem our dead is their a place prepared  to go and Redeem our dead No their is not we give Endowmets  Here but it is like trying to step on the top round first. if we  had the privilege of steping on building a Temple our works  would not be legal but we do these things untill we have time  to build a temple if we had gone onto the top of the mountains  if we had no room it would be legal and right Brothe Kimball  says we have to make our own heaven. The Lord cannot  save us if we do not save ourselves. if we expect to get ourselves  Endowmets we have got to follow the footsteps that God has set for  us to walk in and if we walk in that Channel God own our labours  and acknowledges all that is done. Now all the ordinances will have to be attended to again when we get a temple yet if any  one dies in the faith those ordinances will be legal but all  that live will have to do it again And I want to say as a  Revelation that if you will not help build a Temple and have faith in the work you will be lost a word to those who  have got their Endowments we shall work as fast as  we can and what we have done is legal if we had been  in own land and had a right to a Temple we should not do as we now  do many who have died in the faith have been worn out ther  ordinaces are legal. Those who came in the church first and  are faithful have a right to the ordinances first. I wish  the people to understand that when the People Lord has  any thing for them they will have it but when the  Lord has Nothing for the people I dont wish them  to teaze me for what they cannot have. when their  is to be a work done I will tell you. Now we shall begin  to build a Temple in 1853. This Tabernacle will have to  accomodate the people untill the Temple is built. if this wont  answer for the people untill we build a Temple we will make  a Bowery on the North and South sides of the Block as soon  as the Temple is built we will give you your Endowments   ENDENTRY if their is any who was in Jackson County and other places  and have helped to build up the kingdom of God in the  early days we want to bless them first and if their is any  man or child who went in the Battalion or in the Pioneers come forward and get your blessings before others and we will bless you if you are faithful their  is no blessing in the Celestial Law or kingdom of God but  what you will get Father before  I shall be a legal heir. If I was to die and their was not a  child of mine to live to do it for me Some Friend would be raised up to do it for me if not my Body will soon be raised  up and I would be in some temple with my Brethren to  tell them what to do I can see the Hearts of man and the Spirits of  of men if they do triy to be hid I can see them I see many who asspire to be the first and to be exhalted above their fellows but I can tell you all you will be rewarded according to what you do whether you do little or much or nothing  at all some wish to be above Brother Brigham why was I not  called before Brother Brigham Joseph why does not some  one ask the Lord to appoint them to be above Brother Brigham but the Lord will laugh at you such forget the kingdom of God  they are corrupt let evry man say what can I do to build up the kingdom of God Ask the Mother who is trying to do the will  of God what her reward will be they will say I dont know I  will say if you are faithful and satisfied with your condition in  this life and you will be blessed and satisfyed with your conditon in the world to come let evry one strive to be satisfyed  with their condition in life and that will be a blessing to them we are in debt and we can pay those debts in oxen now  we want to have the Brethren turn out some oxen to pay  those debts andc   Elder Banks followed in some interesting  remarks and said the spirit of God was burning like a fire  in his bones I dont ask Brother Young to say that the Lord has sent him and that he must say this or that in the name  of the Lord I dont belive that any man has made a sacrific  for this kingdom for all that a man does he gets his  reward for not ownly in this world but in the word to come  Eternal life. it is distressing to hear men say they want the president to get a Revelation in order to do this or that  his council to me is sufficient. I also hear men say that we are the off scourings of the Earth it is a great burlesk on the Church and kingdom of God for you are the greatest people  and the most blessed of any on Earth you have power to teach kings and princes and potentates of the Earth tremble. I have seen  a man that had learned but 3 letters and forgotten 2 of them  was ignorant yet he made a learned Doctor fear and tremble and leave the House this people are a wonderful people there are none  like them I have herd the Presidet say that instead of our  being called to pay one tenth we should be healed as Tithing and end  all we possess be ready to help build up the kingdom of God the spirt  of God is w with this people   Brother John Young next  addressed the assemble and bore Testimony tha Joseph Smith  was a prophet of God tha Brigham Yog W Richards   ENDENTRY instead of being heirs according to promise. the pristhood is  eternal without the begining of days or end of life as the Apostle  has expressed it but man through aposticy which is entire disobedi- ance has lost or suffered the keys and privileges of the Priesthood  to be taken away from them and they left to wander in darkness  and practice all manner of wickedness untill thousands became the  vessals of wrath and were doomed to destruction for as long as men are without the Priesthood they continue to wander from God  and never retrace their steps untill it is done by the priesthood, and the  Idea of the Saints being led by fals Prophets is just a notion accor- ding to the light in which they view them all the fals prophets we  have are men who have turned aside from the truth.   The man is the head and God of the woman, but let him act like a  God in virteous principles and God like conversation, walk and  deportment and such men will continue to gain influence and power  and advance in glory to all eternity. But should they use there  power in wickedness as a tyrant they soon will be called to  render an account of their stewardship. if not found worthy  they will be hurled down to perdition and their family and kingdom  be given to another that is more worthy. Some say that a  woman cannot be saved without a man, neither can a man  without a woman. Br Joseph said he had taught the Twelve  all that he knew concerning the order of the kingdom but the  difficulty was they could not remember it as he told them, but  when it was necessary they would not be at a loss for under- standing; and I bear record to the truth of his word before God  this day that I always had an understanding and evry thing  was brought to my mind just as he taught them to us. All the  ordinances of the Temple and building of the Alter andc. came to me just  right when they were to be attended to and could we now know  Br Taylor's feelings you would say that they could  read a man through as soon as they cast there eyes upon him. The Apostle Paul while speaking of the Fathers and the Ancients  said that thay without us could not be made perfect there  was a lack in his day and still will be to all eternity untill the  chain of that Priesthood is restored and evry spirit take a taber- nacle that was fore ordained according to the dispensation of the  will of God. I am entitled to the Keys of the Priesthood  according to linage and blood, so is Brother H. C. Kimball and many others  have taken Kingly power and grades of the Priesthood. this we  would have taught in the Temple if time had permitted.  Joseph Smith was entitled to the Keys of the Priesthood according  to blood still he was the fourth son. But when we get another  Temple built then we will teach you concerning these things suffice it to say that I will extend the chain of the Prist- hood back through the Apostolic dispensation to Father Adam  just as soon as I can get a temple built. Jesus could have  restored the order of the Pristhood in his day and brought in  the Millenium if the people would have harkened to his inst- ructions but they rebelled and would not, and it was for this  cause that Jesus told them that all the blood that had been  shed from righteous Abel down to Zechariah the Prophet should  be required at there hands.   I have a request to make of my family and that is that they  (esspecially old people) omit calling me their Father. Call  me Brother Brigham. I shall feel better when you do   ENDENTRY for I do not consider that I am worthy of that appelation Father in the Priesthood implies the great head, the term  would be proper to Father Adam. Jesus had reference  to the same thing when He told his deciples not to call any  man Father on earth for their Father was in heaven. The seal of the covenant that I have been speaking off  to day was what the Apostle saw previous to the destruction  of the wicked when the Angel was commanded not to fear pour  out the vials of wrath on the wicked untill the saints were sealed  in thereir forehead and when this was done they all became Father Adams family. Those that are adopted into my family and take me  for their councellor if I continue faithful I will preside over them throughout all Eternity. I will stand at their head, and  Joseph will stand at the head of this Church and will be there  President Prophet and God to the People in this dispensation. when  we Locate I will settle my family down in the order and teach them  there duty they will then have to provide temporal blessings for  me instead of my boarding from 40 to 50 persons as I now  do. I will administer in spiritual blessings to them. I expect to  live in the house of the Lord and recieve and administer ordinan- ces to my brethren and for the dead all the year round.   President H. C. Kimball arose and addressed the meeting at some  moments. Bore testimony that what President Young had  said was true and rejoiced to meet with them andc. Br O. Pratt also addressd the meeting a few moments bore testimony to the truth and also rejoiced to meet with them. There was then an intermission untill after supper The table was well furnished and supplyed. 40 persons could  be seated at the Table at a time. the men were seated to the  right with there companion oposite them. commencing with the  Twelve President Young at there head. then in order the adopted  children begining with the 1st that was adopted. the band  and choir kept their seats, and continued there sweet strains of music  while the guest were partaking of the rich festival. While at the  table Brother John ^H.^ Tippets entered the  house they came direct fromt the from the Mormon Battalion  280 miles south of River Riogrand on the 10th  of Nov 1847. they piloted 56 sick men to Fort Purbolo whare  Capt Brown esstablishment were stationed from there  came in on Pack Mules were 50 days on the way. were taken  prisoners twice by the Indians, once was sentenceed to death  by the Pawnees were 30 days without bread and 5 days witho ut much of any thing to eat. Brought a package of 137 letters brought good account from fort Purbulow but rather  unfavorable from the Battalion their faces were covered with  hair and there persons resembled a mountaineer. it was a  miracle that the lives of the men were saved from the  Indians and cold. They were seated to the table in the  guarbd they arived in. their arival produced no small stir through the camp. men and women came in all directions  to enquire after there friends in the Armey. After the men  were refreshed we went into council with them and they rehears ed the situation of the Battallion that they had been on  half rations for three weeks when they left them and no prosp- page torn ects of more than half rations should they attempt to cross the page torn mountains this winter. However report reached Santa fe page torn   ENDENTRY they arived that the Battalion had taken the Alpasio a strong  hold between the Riogrand and the Mountains without the fireing of a gun. if this report is true the Battalion will have an  abundance of support and likely take up winter quarters many other remarks were made and President Young said that  if they had harkened to his council not a man of them would  have fallen but would have returned to their friends in  perfect safety.   At 7 oclok we returned to the Council  House. found the Saints rejoicing in what had heard through  the day. Elder Isaac Morley said that his soul was filled  with rejoicing to see the beauty and harmony of the family  connecting links of the Priesthood that had been taught  this day: And when I look at the family connexion  I cannot but acknowledge him my leader in all things  and he looking to Joseph the Martered Prophet who has gone  to prepare the way for us, and can do more for us than  he could do if he was here. This Pristhood spoken off  if from all Eternity and will lead to eternity and will exhalt  the Saints to be Gods through faithfulness.   President Young arose and continued his remarks upon the  law of adoption granted the brethren the privilege of asking  questions when they did not fully comprehend his meaning The Lord introduced the law of adoption for the benefit of the  children of men as a school master to bring them back into the  covenant of the Priesthood. This Principle I am aware is  not clearly understood by many of the Elders in this Church  at the present time as it will here after be: And I confess that  I have had ownly a smattering of those things but when it  is necessary I will attain to more knowledge on the subject  and consequently will be enabled to teach and practice more and will in the mean time glorify God the bountiful giver. I have heard Elders say they were not dependant upon any  man, I then considerd and do now that it was saying more  than I can say, for I consider that we are all dependant  one upon another for our exhaltation and that our interest is inseperably connected. (for example) what can my family do without me supposing they were to all turn away from me I hold the Keys over them through which they are to receive there exhaltation. would they would not be like sheep without  a shepherd and would be devoured by the wolves, they certainly  would. then let us change the position, and say that I would  cut off all my family, then what glory would I have with no body to rule over but my own dear little self. To tell you my feelings  I would rather be annihilated than to be in that situation. This is another strong proof of the Apostles saying when they declaired  that they without us could not be made perfect. Neither can  you without me nor I without you be made perfect ie if we  are faithful and without faithfulness there is no perfection on any  consideration. This rule applyes to the whole human family.  This is the torment and misery of the disobedient spirits that they  cannot be made perfect, unless some scheme should hereafter  be introduced for their redemption. they are now without tabernacles  to dwell in ownly such as they have taken possession off unlawfully  page torn usurped power over. it being a part of their agency that was  page torn bestowed them which they used to the consumation of there unhappy  page torn wretched estate, it being the reward and fruits of there doings   ENDENTRY having been given over to all manner of wickedness perm- itted to afflict the handy work of the Lord untill they fill up the cup of their iniquity and the Lord sayeth unto  them thou wicked and disobedient spirit thou shalt not have  power any longer to afflict my people or destroy the  works of my hands, you have forfeited your agency and  wrought thy fulness, depart hence to the pit that I have  prepared for thee, and this is there torment, that thereir power  and agency is taken away. they are left to regret that it was through their own disobediance that they cut the thread of  there own salvation: the reflections of which ownly serve to  torture and increase there torment and that would be the situation  of my family should they cut themselves off from me. I use  my family for an example, not that I have the least fears  of their ever doing so, for I have none. I feel happy this  night because we are of one mind, still should I believe that we  were perfect and could not advance any further I should not be happy  but to the honor power and glory of the faithful there is no end. For your satisfaction I will show you a rule by which you may  comprehend the exhaltation of the faithful. I will use myself  as a figure, and say that I am ruling over 10 sons or subjects page torn ownly and soon each one of them would have 10 men sealed  to them and they would be ruler over them and that would  make me ruler over 10 Presidents or Kings whareas I was  page torn ruler over 10 subjects ownly or in other words I ruled over one Kingdom but now I rule over 10. then let each  one get 10 more then I would be ruler over 100 Kingdoms and so on continued to all eternity and the more honor and glory that I could bestow upon my sons the more it would add to my  exhaltations. but to clip the thread of your exhaltation then  whare would be your your glory: it would be like the fallen  angels or devils that kept not their first esstate but were reserved in everlasting chains of darkness unto the judgment of the great  day others fell from heaven were thrust down to hell;  but if wyou wish to advance hold up the hands of your file  leader and boast him a head. should you have ten legions of  trains following on after you, you should say to your file leader push ahead for I am coming with my train boosting  him up at the same time instead of trying to pass by him this would stimulate him and he would say come on my boys I will travel as fast as you can and on we would go in  one solid train to all Eternity. Before I close I will answer  one question that has been asked me repetedly. Should I  page covered have a father dead that has never herd this gospel, would  it page covered be required of me to redeem him and have him adopted to some mans family and I be adopted unto my Father answer No. If we have to attend the ordinances of rede- page torn mption for our dead relatives we then become their saviors  page torn and were we to wait to redeem our dead relatives before we  page torn could link the chain of the Priesthood we would never page torn accomplish it. Many other remarks were made and while  page torn addressing the females said Sisters if you expect to call me  page torn Br Brigham I want you to be cleanly keep your faces, hands page torn and skin clean from head to foot your clothes dishes and houses  page torn clean also your children and teach them manners. and when  page torn you mix up Bread dont have a dozen flies in your tray   ENDENTRY I know that the women generally rule there husbands  and the children their Mothers. But when a woman under- takes to rule me I want her to be so secret about it that I  cannot catch her at it. Now I do not want the brethren from my remarks to abuse thereir wives, but treat them  kindly: do there heavy luging but dont wash there dishes  as some men do. At the close of the remarks there was a  little exercise by music and dancing and the meeting was dismised    ENDENTRY February 17, 1847 ~ Wednesday   17th The family meeting of President Young met again to  day but Br Young himself spent an exceding sick day was taken in the night and suffered much.

I have Enlisted for a great  salvation we make our own Heaven or Hell and have Angels or Devils enough to fill it.

Brother Joseph said Be Humball and Teachable and  the Lord will bless you speak a good word occasionally for Brothe Joseph I believe the next time we are opposed the door will be opened wider and wider then ever and we shall be Freeer then Ever I want to live in such a manner that at last we may meet  Brother Joseph with a glad Heart and cheerful countenance and a smile upon the face.   ENDENTRY Brother Kimball next spoke and said our design is to teach the people and perfect them for what is to come I have herd many say what sacrafices they had made for this cause but I have left all for the cause I do not call it a sacrafie you are to be rewarded with me. The Saints will have trials to pass through the day will come when the women will have to Feed the Beef and pork while the men go to war, take the counsel of Brother Young and the Leaders of this Church you have got to follow your leaders and they will lead you to the celestial kingdom of God keep the things that have been committed to you and the Lord will preserve you come to meeting to night male and female at 6 oclk and we will tell you sumthing I never saw this people when they were doing better or felt better than they do to day I know that Brother Brigham is tender and kind to this people their is no woman more kind to a child than he is  to this people He is a Father to us continually I am going  to put in evry Ox I have got into the public works and  I want evry man to do the same untill the debts are paid we must trust in God and cleave unto him as Jesus does unto the Fater   Meeting adjourned till evening when the House was filled agan and was addressed By Bishop Hunter who told his experience since he came into the Church and was followed By President Young   FIGURE President Young arose and said I will bear Testimony  to awhat Brother Hunter said that the Elders go work and pull in ther wards and get the people to gathe at my house if nowher els and preach if it is but few moments I would pray and labor  till I could Preach you say that you would go and preach to the Stranger and teach them the gospel I know it is esier to teach  them than it is to get the Saints togethe and teach them to be saved and exalted I now it is the desire of this people  to get sumthing new but you should improve upon what you have Here is the place to expose your ignorance and fals views, to let them out and be corrected if you have faults dont go into private Houses and preach them whare thare is no one to correct you nor while abroad among others countrys but here is the place to let your Errors out not keep them back. Teach people to controll themselves teach good doctrin and practice it Here is the place to become a polished shaft I like to reman here to see you to be with you. I want to say to the Elders of Israel ofwere you ordained to preach the gospel if so it is not wisdom or prudent to mingle with the excesses of the  wicked or in any of their exercises for then the devil will have no advantage over you I mingle with the Saints here in thei recreations and exercises but let me go abroad and subject myself to mingle with the wicked I am on the Devils ground and subject myself to him. If I mingle with any company here for recreation I controll that company but if I step onto the Devils ground He controlls it. remember then at all times that what you do do it in the name of the Lord and let all your acts be to do the will of God it is so that a man could not exercise his privileges because of the tradition of the world all Christians would think it a great sin to have a Fiddle   ENDENTRY they would say it is wicked to have music they have made it  a sin I have not put a desire in my heart for music, but  the Lord has. Music will calm the ferocious beasts who  caused this the Lord. I want to say a few words about  tithing you now what was said at the last confernc the  Saints have done more during the last 7 months than  in 7 years before I feel to bless you call upon this people  to put their all upon the Alter and they will do it I feel like a Father to this people. No mother can love Her babe more than I do this people. when you do wrong I feel oppressed in spirit  and the Lord is grieved I feel to urge it upon you all to sceace  to do evel and learn to do righ all that we have is the Lords He  does as He pleases the Thrones and kingdoms of the world are  all governed by him and in the End all will be found right  and they will find they have an agency unto themselves and  all will do as they please if they do right they will be  saved get Glory and Exaltation and the wicked will go to Hell there is no place whare God is not find Empty space and there the  Lord will not be.   FIGURE I will now preach you another Sermon  their is one great Master inand Head in all kingdoms and governments  So with our Father in Heaven is a Tabernacle He created us  in the likeness of his own image. The Son has also a Taberna cle like the Father and the Holy Ghost is a minister to the people but  not a tabernacle who begat the Son of God Infidels say that  Jesus was a Bastard but let me tell you the truth concerning  that matter. Our Father begat all the spirits that were before  any tabernacles were made when our Father came into the  Garden He came width his celestial body and brought one of his  wifes with him and eat of the fruit of the garden untill  He could beget a tabernacle and Adam is Michael or God  and all the God that we have any thing to do with they Eat  of this fruit and formed the first Tabernacle that was  formed and when the VIRGIN MARY was begotton  with child it was by the Father and in no other way in no other way ownly as we were begotton I will tell you  the Truth as it is in God. The world dont know that Jesus  Christ Our Elder Brother was begotton by our Father in Heaven  Handle it as you please it will either seal the damnation or  salvation of man He was begotton by the Father and not  by the Holy Ghost. When you go to Preach and believe that  Jesus Christ was begotton by the Holy Ghost dont lay Hands  upon the Heads of Females for the reception of the Holy  Ghost lest it Beget her with Child and you be accused  I have told you nothing in this thing but what you have  red in the Bible I do not frame it.   The President then refered to the tithing and said if one quartor of  the Tithing money that was due had been paid we should  have had more means the merchanets have carried away  $200,000 to the States did the people pay tithing on that No now Bishops see to this matter and then see what your  feelings would be if you was in my place and see the  Hundreds that call upon me and my Brethren if the Tithing  was paid that is due we would have enough to pay all  debts I now say to the Bishops go to my yard and take all my stok  and lick all up clean then do the same by my Brethren untill  all the debt are paid All voted to follow the presidents example   ENDENTRY April 10, 1852 ~ Saturday   FIGURE Saturday morning meeting opened at 10 oclok House filled  FIGURE Prayer by W. Woodruff President Kimball called for  Professor A Carrington but made the following remark you have learned Enough to know know that the spirit of  God will be grieved at any folly manifest in the House  of God Angels are ministering spirits to those who are heirs  of salvation but when you do wrong the Angels of the  Lord will leave and the Angels of the devil will take there  place and keep their company then you are on dangerous  ground and if you will not hear the prophets that God sends  unto you you would not hear the Angels of God some  have said that I was vary presumptuous to say this  Brothor Joseph  was his God the one that gave Joseph the keys of the  kingdom was his God which was Peter Jesus Christ  was his God and the God and Fathe of Jesus Christ was  Adam. The Lord wants us to have wisdom to circumscribe  the Earth do you not suppose that God has pleasure in  seeing this people who are the weak things of the Earth to confound  the wise Noble and great some will tell the gentiles all that  transpires among us   Brothe Joseph Young followed with  a few remarks   FIGURES A Carrington was then called to the Stand who  arose and said I rejoice with you my Brethren in the  blessings you enjoy yes I rejoice with you. Brother Kim- ball sayes that what I say will be right. All science  that is in the world that is not consistant with reason and  demonstration is false. But all that is truth is good no matter  who has it. with regard to Education we are all interested  in it yet we have different views of it. Their is three  things that are hard to speak upon 1st is a dinner  speech 2nd is a Temperance speech 3rd is a speech on Education I despise that vain phylosophy that  puffeth up. I do not know of any truth that does  not belong to salvation that is of worth evry thing that  is knowledge pertains to salvation we have come unto  the work and have to save ourselves our Children and our  progenitors I dont know of any thing that we can do  to lay a foundation for this better than to disipline  the mind and Body and bring them both in subjection to  the mind and will of God the ownly way we can do right is to keep the commandments of God. One of the commandments  of God require us to multiply and replenish the Earth when a  young man gets married to a good young woman and the  Hunny moon is over and a foundation laid for posterity  then the man begins to scold his wife the wife gets the  same spirit and this goes to the child this is an Evil and follows  the child through life. The Blood nurses the embrio and  as the child grows the Evil increases with the child the Hunny moon should last always and the Husband should  gratify the wife in all things that she righteously wishes as far as he can and the mother should possess a spirit of contentment  and peace at least untill the child leaves the Breast then you   ENDENTRY will see a Noble Tabernacle for a Noble spirit to dwell  in the spirits in Eternity have their times and seasons  would not a Noble spirit rather take a Noble Tabernacle  than a poor one when many children are born they  cannot suck the breast because of the corruption of  their parents this is probably the fault of the Doctors  for not teaching the female as they ought to be taught  and when the child is born the practice has been to give  it a Brandy tody or Chamber lie while the breast is the  place for the child let the child have the milk and let let  such foolery alone dont play with the tabernacles of your  children or treat them foolishly but treat them in  wisdom you dont see any body giving a Brandy Tody or  chamber lye and they do well to follow the course of nature The gentile Doctors cannot cure deseases they do not know how I will prove it to you the old school give medicine by the  shovel full. The New school will not give a pill as large  as the smallest Bird shot. is their any Equality in this I say  down with the whole system I have no use for them next  comes the Hdrapath the water cures well even water is  not to be trifled with look at the foolery and the difference  of the doctors it is much better to follow out the natural law  in all things than to trust to them who would ever think of  giving such a dose to a calf as they would give a child Their is no such children as the Latter day Saints  If we cannot do what we want to our children may  if we cannot get back to the primeval platform becaus of the primeval platfor iniquity of our Fathers  still it is our duty to teach them principle and truth when  children begin to talk dont teach them baby talk for  what you learn the child in that state has to be unl- earned then be careful what you say or do before  your children for you would be asstonished at the atte- ntion children pay to what you say. Be sure to take time  to teach your children and not neglect it many other  interesting remarks were made by Brother Carrington on  the occasion   Brother G A. Smith followed with interesting  remarks   President B Young next followed and said I want to bear  testimony to what Brother Carrington has said he  has spoken the truth I thank him for what he has  said what he has said is true and if we follow the testi mony we will return to the power of our first parents  his is the way for the Nations of the Earth to return  to God. The Lamanites will be a white and delightsom  people through this procedure or principle the Nation  of the Earth cannot return to God upon any other  principle this kind of teaching is what pleases me the  Doctors are ignorant and they teach others to be ignorants we should understand our organization but the people  of this day have lost all good scense they are a set of   ENDENTRY April 11, 1852 ~ Sunday   Sunday Morning April 11th After singing and prayer Broth Kimball addressed the meeting and said the spirit of God  would make a humbly man handsome I do not place my affections upon any thing but God and Jesus Christ  you ought to love Brother Brigham enough to keep his  commandments so with my family if they love  me they will keep my commandments if you want to  be a friend to Brother Brigham and his counsellors live Holy before God and do right and if you will do what you know you will do right do by your neighbor as you would wish  him to do unto you Some men wanted to get women  from their husbands who are dead and get them  sealed to them such would rob the dead this is  wrong let me do for the dead what they cannot do for themselves and this is right and the dead will plead  for that man to be blessed. Never take a course a course to rob the dead I will have time to redeem  all my dead friends either in time or Eternity the Malinium will be spent in the Temples of the Lord  in Redeeming our dead if my friends will not Receive my testimony I will let them alone and when they have been in Hell long enough I will go and Redeem  them I will take a course to get tothe Bless Blessing upon  my seed that Adam had upon his seed Joseph had it  and I have it if my children sin they will have i to  Repent of and pay for it but will be saved in the End.  we should not go to law with each other all that  will not go to Law say I all said I, I would as lieves be damned without a man as to be damned  with a man that would steal a dead mans wife for  he will be damned any how. I will say that Brother Hunter is the chief Bishop and he has a right to chose his two counsellors Bishop Hunter arose  and made some remarks and said he should choose men   ENDENTRY that could assist He said Brother Brigham Young was at the Head and his councellors were inspired of  the Holy Ghost I select for my councellors Brigham Young and Heber C Kimball. Then Brother Kimball  and Hunters Head and blessed him in the following words  O God the Eternal Father I ask in the name of Jesus  Christ while we lay our hands upon thy head  that all our words may be dictaited by the Holy spirit  while we set apart Brother Hunter as a presiding Bishop we here by set you apart to be a presiding Bishop  and to be a Judge in Israel we bless you with the spirit of your Office and calling you shall have wisdom to Judge between good and Evil in all things and to be  a great Benefit to the House of Israel and that they  may uphold thee by their faith that thou mayest  administer in in faith and righteousness and be a great  blessing to the people and administer to the poor and nedy thou shalt have desernment like the lightning to detect it evil and those who seek to deceive and that all may receive  thy teachings and that thy work may work together for the  good of all the people even so Amen  Brother Truman Angel was Nominated to continue  in his office of Architect for the Church was carried  FIGURE Brother Kimball said to Brother Brigham  you shall be blessed and all your House and not one of them  shall be lost and no man shall get betwen me  and Brother Brigham and Brothe Richards and no  man or woman shall get between the Twelve  and Presidency if they do they will get pinched  and any man or woman that tries to get between  us will be damned they tried to prejudice Joseph against us in his day and they will be damned The Twelve are the best men that live and any  man that tries to put their feet upon their neck  will get the feet of the Twelve upon their neck (Brother Brigham came in at this time) do as Br  Brigham tells you and all will be right and you will  not have sorrow follow my council and you will  not have sorrow. If my own family would take  my council and had faith in me I would never have  a doctor in my family but I have doctors here  that I have faith in but let me send for a doctor  and they have faith in him and not in me then what  for them am I. Brother Brigham said that is  true and worthy of note it is natural for a man to be always borrowing trouble but we have trouble enough without borrowing. If you are not one you are not  mine saith the Lord but if you abide in me you will bring forth fruit to the glory of God when we  learn this lesson our sorrows will scease when we  get the cloak off we shall be in heaven In this   ENDENTRY House is my Heaven for I am in a heavenly place  with Holy men and Angels The Bishop with Brothe Hunter are good men. Seth Taft was appointed a travelling Bishop others were spoken off as travelling Bishops I have been talking about the union in the world their  would be a patition between the different Branches  but in the kingdom of God it is not so but they are all united. If I hier a man to work I want him to be faithful in all things evry man should earn all they can and labour all they are able to do and not over labour I believe a man should be paid according to what they  earn as God rewards men according to their works The old Lions neck is out of the yoke and they will not  put it on again for Brother Brigham shall whip  them out and they shall not whip him out nor me nor my Brethren. you shall be blessed and the Earth shall bring forth for your good and your shlall be blessed in  your posterity And I say it in the name of Jesus Christ Brother Brigham said it was a prophesy and was true   Conference was Adjurned untill the special confenc in August    ENDENTRY April 12, 1852 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY April 23, 1852 ~ Friday   From this conference till Friday Apriail 23rd I  spent the time at home doing my spring work and prepar ing to go on our Journey to the South On this day April 23rd I left the dry creek in  Utah through a snow storm and spent the night in company  with Brother Nobles on the Bank of the creek 30 miles The object of this Journey was to accompany the presidency  to visit the Southern settlements and explore as far as we had  an opportunity    ENDENTRY April 24, 1852 ~ Saturday   24th we rode Held a meeting rode to Hobble Creek went forth in the dance with the saints in that place distance of the day 25 mls    ENDENTRY April 25, 1852 ~ Sunday   25 Sunday we held a meeting at the school House the  people were addressed by B Young  H.
