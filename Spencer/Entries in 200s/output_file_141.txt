 BLESSINGS ENJOYED BY THE SAINTS.  Remarks by Elder WILFORD WOORDRUFF, made in the Tabernacle, Grea[t] Salt Lake City, May 12, 1861.  REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.  Brethren and sisters, after the congregation receiving so much in- structions, I feel that I shall make my remarks very brief. It is truly  good to sit and hear the word of the Lord, and it is truly a good thing to believe in it; but it is still better to practise it.  I have reflected to-day, as I fre- quently do, with regard to the mercy of God and his loving-kindness to the children of men. The positions that the children of men occupy with regard to the difference there is in the minds of men on the subject of religion and the character of God is 
 an important one. I have considered the responsibility that rests upon men in regard to these things. There seems to be very few that really have faith in the Lord God of our fathers. If we judge them by their works, we must certainly come to this conclu- sion. It is certainly a great blessing to this people that they have faith in God and in the promises of our  Heavenly Father.  Truth is one of the attributes of the Almighty, and what he promises he will fulfil. Now, if the children of men believed this, they could save themselves a great deal of trouble. If those who embrace the Gospel could have confidence to abide in the truth, they would escape many trying scenes through which the wicked will have to pass. The trouble that awaits this nation, and that other nations have had to pass through in various ages that are past, has been because they have had no confidence in the  Lord. They have not obeyed him, but have turned from him rejected the counsel given to them. It will be precisely so with this nation when their afflictions begin to come upon them, for the Lord will be avenged. We can now see the words of the Lord and his Prophets fulfilling before our eyes.  This is a peculiar generation a singular time in which we live. There seems to be a great deal of the word of the Lord fulfilling in our day and age of the world. We profess to acknowledge the hand of the Lord in what we see around us, and I trust we do it in our hearts. We have read, many years ago, the promise contained in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants concerning the nation in which we live. The Lord said, in the early rise of this Church, in speaking of this land, that we should hear of wars abroad; but at the same time we should not know the hearts of the children of men in our own country. And the commandment was to his people to prepare them- selves to stand in holy places when the indignation of the Almighty should be passing over the earth. We now see these things coming to pass. They are plain and clear before our eyes. We have a part fulfilled; and as truth is one of the attributes of the Almighty, everything that he says he will fulfil. The promise is to the whole world "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned." This promise is sure; and if the Lord fulfils in one instance, he will in another. He will save the people if they will obey him; and if they do  not he will not save them, but they  will have to reap the reward that is due them for their works.  I consider that it is a blessing that  I have the opportunity of believing in the Gospel and in the word of the Lord. I believe in them, and rejoice to know that they are true, and that they will be fulfilled. I bear my testimony to the truth of this Gospel. I also testify that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of the Lord. I know this  as well as I do that I exist. I know by inspiration and by the revelations of Jesus Christ and the manifesta- tions of the Spirit of God from year to year and from time to time. I likewise see around me the fulfilment of prophecy, and this tends to strengthen me, and also every Latter- day Saint. The Scriptures tell us that there is a spirit in man, and that the inspiration of the Almighty giveth it understanding. It is upon this principle that we become ac- quainted with the truth, and the power of the Gospel which we have received. The principles of eternal life are manifested unto us by the in- spiration of the Holy Ghost; for that Spirit rests upon us it influences our minds; and if we watch those teachings, having within us the right feeling, 
 we shall comprehend things clearly as they are. We can see the Lord speaking to the nations and vexing  them in his hot displeasure, and still many eat, drink, and are satisfied, and do not appear to be as energetic and active as they might be. It is our duty to be alive and wide-awake to the times, for the things that are transpiring are joyful, because in them we see the accomplishment and fulfil- ment of the predictions of the Pro- phets of God that have lived in this generation. The things we are ex- periencing now are attended with salvation, and are preparing us to magnify our callings and fulfilling the object of our creation upon the earth.  I always rejoice in seeing my fellow-men come to a knowledge of the truth by obedience to the Gospel as taught by the servants of the Lord. When men have gone forth in the waters of baptism, and received the  laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, they receive the same truth, the same light as we have re- ceived; and thus we become of one heart and one mind, and follow out the inspiration of the Holy Ghost which attend his Gospel. In preach- ing the Gospel and administering the ordinances of the Lord's house, the Spirit of inspiration of heaven ac- companies those who officiate, that it will remain ever with them, if faith- ful, in all the duties of life.  When I hear the brethren speak of the dealings of God with the present generation, I perceive that their minds all run together. The record which they bear is one; they all agree in their testimony; they are one in stating that the work of the Lord our God will prevail over all its enemies. But it is a calamity, as we look at it naturally, for the generation in which we live, that the Gospel is preached and by them rejected; in consequence of which the Spirit is taken from them, because they follow the devices of their own hearts and their wicked imaginations. They follow the de- vices of the Evil One, and they spread it broadcast, as it were, the cross which brings death and destruction, which brings sorrow and mourning; and this is the case with many in the  present day and age of the world. There is not a man to-day that has the Spirit of the Lord, and that is faithful in his calling, but what can see the state of things both in and out of the Church. He can see them with his eyes, and hear them with his ears, and they can see the hand of God thrown over his people to-day.  I rejoice in the blessings that the Lord gives, and I feel that we ought to be faithful. If there are anybody who are blessed of the Lord, it is the Latter-day Saints; and if there are anybody upon the earth who are and should be willing to obey counsel, it is the Saints of the living God. We have reaped the benefit of it for years, and we know that it brings forth joy, peace, and consolation to the souls of men; and we would certainly be very foolish to turn away from the only source that will bring us joy, salva- tion, and eternal life. To do this, we should have to turn our backs upon the only friends we have, and shut up the only source from which we draw the blessings we have in this life.  The world really do not know what they are doing; they don't  comprehend what lies before them; they jndge after the hearing of the ear, and while calamities will over- take the wicked, as the Lord has spoken, we have something to hold on to and to rely upon. We have seen the hand dealings of the Almighty with us; we have learned his promises. Has he broken his promises to his people? He has not; He has been faithful and true. I  firmly believe that we shall partake 
 of all the blessings of the kingdom of God by obeying the counsel of those set over us, for I know that God has established a government to control, to guide, and to dictate; and we shall not find so perfect a government as this in any part of the earth, for it is the government of heaven.  I desire that we may have power and a disposition to live faithful to- day, to do right, to obey counsel, that whatever we are told to do we may unite together and do with all our hearts. If there is strength any- where, it is here. If it does not exist here, it does not exist anywhere. There is no spirit of friendship in the world; it has taken the wings of the morning and flown away from many of the nations, and the blessings of the Lord are being withdrawn in a great measure from the nations of  the earth. The people have no dis- position to obey that which is right, or give the servants of God an op- portunity of preaching the truth for the salvation of fallen man. Those who despise those blessings and pri- vileges will find that the consequences and reward will follow.  I feel thankful that we are here in the valleys of the mountains; and I rejoice that we are at peace, and not obliged to fortify Great Salt Lake City, as the people are obliged to do in Washington; nor is our President compelled to flee to Canada to save his life. We are safe and in quietude. The enemies of this kingdom do not understand the spirit and power of the Gospel. It is a spirit and a power that they cannot cope with, and it is so with all the sectarian world. We have the privilege of lying down and of rising up in peace; we have the privilege of bowing in our families in peace, and getting up and speaking our sentiments, and none to make us afraid.  These are great blessings that we as a people enjoy. I bear my testimony that these things are true and faith- ful. You know these things as well as I do, and every man who lives his religion knows it. The Lord is with his people, and this kingdom will spread abroad. And when the Lord has destroyed the wicked, there will be room for Zion to spread herself abroad, and to rebuild the waste places thereof. Then all things spoken of in the Book of Doctrine and Cove- nants will be fulfilled. It is good to reflect upon these principles, for the promises will be fulfilled, whether we believe them or not.  I pray God to guide us, that we may be prepared to partake of eternal life and salvation, and share in all the benefits of the Gospel of Christ, and of the Holy Priesthood which has been revealed to us in our day and generation, which I ask in the  name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  REMARKS by Elder W. Woodruff, delivered in the New Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, July 19,th, 1868.  -[REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.]-  THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ESSENTIAL TO ABIDE ITS LAWS.  I am requested to occupy a little time this afternoon in speaking to the people. It is a great satisfaction to me, and I presume it is to all Latter- day Saints who enjoy their religion, to contemplate and realize that God is our friend, and that we have the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Religion is very popular in the world, and has been for many generations; and the religions of the world are as various as the temporal governments of the world. But for a person or commu- nity to know and understand for themselves the true gospel, the gos- pel of Jesus Christ, must be a source of great consolation.  I have taken a great deal of satis- faction in the gospel of Christ; in fat it has been my life. I have tra- veled and preached this gospel for the last thirty-five years, more or less, either to the world or to the Saints of God. And in my contemplations and meditations, when I have had sufficient of the spirit of God upon me, I have realized the gifts and graces and blessings pertaining to  the salvation of men in the gospel of Christ.  The governments of the world are varied.  We have despotic, monarch- ical and republican governments, and in order to become a citizen of any one of them we have to obey the laws of that government. A great deal has been said about the form of go- vernment, and the constitution under which we live. They have been the praise of all Americans, and perhaps of people living in other portions of the earth. We consider that we have been blessed as a nation in possessing the freedom and privileges guaran- teed by the Constiution of the Uni- ted States. They have been a rich legacy from our fathers. We consi- der our form of government superior to any other on the earth. It gua- rantees to us "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." And while the inhabitants of many other go- vernments have been tyranically bound up, and their minds controlled in certain channels, and they have been deprived of the right of liberty of speech and of many other rights valued by freemen, ours has guaran- teed unto us all the liberty that can be enjoyed by man. Still, I have many times thought that we, as American Citizens, have not prized the gifts and blessings guaranteed to us by the Constiution of our country. For the last few years, especially, the Constitution at times, has been look- ed upon as a matter of the smallest consequence. In some respects, how- ever, it has been a blessing to us as a people, and it is to the whole na- tion, as far as it is carried out.  But in order to fully receive its blessings we have to honor its precepts.  Now it is just so with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Those who believe it and obey it in sincerity enjoy far greater blessings than are enjoyed by others. But we have to abide by the laws of the gospel in order to enjoy its blessings and privileges. 
 THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, ETC.  From my childhood up, I have  prized the gospel. Before I heard it proclaimed, I felt when perusing the account of the blessings and privi- leges enjoyed by the ancient Saints and servants of God that I would have been glad to have lived in those days when the priesthood had the keys of the kingdom of God, when they had power to unlock the hea- vens and to command the elements and they would obey; when they had power to heal the sick, cast out de- vils, cause the lame to walk, and the blind to see; when they could receive communication from God, and com- mune with holy angels. I could see a power, glory and exaltation in those principles for which I looked in vain among men in my day; and I desired  to live to see a people by whom such blessings would be again enjoyed. I have lived to see that day. The first time I ever heard this gospel preach- ed, I felt that it was the first gospel sermon I had ever heard; and I went forth and was baptized and received the testimony that it was true, and I have rejoiced in this gospel from that day to this, because I know it is true. And I have wondered many times that there are not more of the inha- bitants of the earth who will open  their ears and hearts to hear and re- ceive it that they may enjoy its bles- sings both in time and eternity.  This Gospel makes us free. Was there ever a more free people than the Latter-day Saints are? No, there  never was in any age of the world. There is not anything that will give a man joy or consolation, or any blessing temporal or spiritual, but what is within our reach as far as man in a mortal state has a right to receive.  When we contemplate the gifts and blessings the Gospel of Christ has given to us, we of all men should be the most cheerful, thankful and faithful, and should honor our cal- ling, and acknowledge the hand of our God in the mercies which we enjoy.  All men who have obeyed this Gospel for the love of the truth, and whose minds have been inspired by the Spirit and power of God, have felt to rejoice and take consolation in it, and they have felt a great desire to spread the knowledge of its prin- ciples among their fellow men. When  first embraced by them it has seemed to them as though they could con- vince the world; and they have been anxious to lay these principles before their father's household, their uncles, aunts, cousins, neighbors and friends, believing that they would receive it. I felt so myself. But I, with many  others, have found myself mistaken in a great measure. I have traveled hundreds and thousands of miles to preach this Gospel. In my travels I have warned many thousands of my fellow men; but have been the instrument, in the hand of God, in gathering very few when compared with the many I have preached to. This has been the experience of all the Elders. We have found, when we came to lay these principles be- fore the world, that they were not ready to receive them. There would be one of a family and two of a city who would open their ears and hearts and would receive the truth, and ga- ther home to Zion. That is the way the Kingdom of God has been built up in this and every other age of the world. There have been but a few here and there that have been quali- fied or prepared to receive and abide the law of God. The minds of the  majority have been prone to evil as the sparks to fly upward; and it has been a hard matter to get the inha- bitants of the earth to listen to our message, and then make it a sub- ject of prayer and receive and obey 
 DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  DELIVERED JUNE 27, 1875, IN THE SECOND WARD SCHOOL-HOUSE, SALT LAKE CITY, AT THE FUNERAL SERVICES OF JOHN HOUSEMAN, AGED SIX YEARS, AND WILLIE FRANKLIN, AGED FOUR YEARS, SONS OF WILLIAM AND ANN WHEELER, BURNED TO DEATH AT WANSHIP, SUMMIT COUNTY, U. T., JUNE 24, 1875.  (Reported by David W. Evans.)  LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, AND ALL WILL BE SAVED GOD, A PERSONAGE OF TABERNACLE THE LIFE OF THE SAVIOR, A LIFE OF SUFFERING SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.  I am entirely dependent this morn- ing upon the Spirit of the Lord to guide and direct me in what I may say upon this painful occasion. Those who have assembled here  Brother and Sister Wheeler, and their 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  friends who mourn with them, are dependent upon the same source for  comfort in their serious bereavement; and in fact we are all dependent upon  the blessing and Spirit of the Lord in  all the labors of life, and I hope that,  in our services this morning, a large  measure of that Spirit will be impar- ted unto us.  I feel disposed to read the ##Job 1|first  chapter## of Job as a preliminary to  any remarks I may make. -[The  speaker read the first chapter of the  Book of Job.]- We also see in read- ing the history of Job that the devil  did not finish with him there, as it  seems the devil had another conversa- tion with the Lord on this subject, in  which he informed the Lord that a  man would give anything for his life,  and that if he, the devil, touched  Job s flesh, he would certainly curse  God. And it seems from reading  this history that the Lord put  Job into the hands of the devil, to do as he pleased with him,  only to spare his life. Of course the history is familiar to you all  who have read the Bible, and you  are aware that the devil smoked Job,  and he was covered with boils from  the crown of his head to the soles of  his feet, so that he was in great dis- tress, trouble and tribulation, yet in  the midst of it all he did not sin, but  acknowledged the hand of the Lord.  I may say, with regard to the case which has brought us together this  morning, it is a little similar to that of Job. We meet with some strange things in the history of our lives in the dispensations and dealings of God with men. In the case before us we are called to mourn the loss of two children taken from Brother and Sister Wheeler, we may say as sud- denly and, in one sense of the word, as miraculously, as were the sons and daughters of Job. His affliction con- sisted of not only in the loss of two children, but of all his children and also of all the possessions that he had, yet still, under all this he said  "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return  thither; the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord." [##Job 1:21##]  I know very well it is hard for any person to be called to pass through the scenes that we sometimes are called to pass through in this life, it is so in the case before us this morn- ing. The loss of these little children, taken away as they were, is certainly painful, not only to the parents, but to eyery person who reflects; and it is a very hard matter for any of us teo enter into and appreciate the depth of sorrow which parents feel on occa- sions like this, it is difficult to bring the matter home to our own hearts unless we have been called to pass through similar affliction and sorrow. At the same time there is no doubt that we all sympathize with our friends when called to pass through trials and bereavement. And I will here say to Brother and Sister Wheeler, and to all my friends, there are a great many worst things in this world than the case we are now call- ed to mourn.  Our children are taken away from us in infancy and childhood, and they are taken away as Job's were, in one sense of the word, through the dis- pensation of Providence, causing us severe trials. This we will acknow- ledge; but, as I have already said, there are many things in this world that are far more painful and afflict- ing than to have our children burned to death. My friends may ask  "What is Brother Woodruff driving at in this remark?" I will tell you. I have lived in these valleys, twenty- seven years, since the pioneers came here. I have seen a whole genera- tion of men and women grow up in 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  it, and abide in its laws and ordi- nances in faithfulness and truth unto death.  When Father Smith gave me my patriarchial blessing he told me I should bring my father's house into the Church and Kingdom of God. I had never seen any member of my father's house from the time I obeyed the gospel until I received my patri- archial blessing, and I rested a good deal on this blessing. Now, all men who were acquainted with Father Jo- seph Smith know that when he laid his hands upon a man's head it seem- ed as if the heavens and the hearts of men were open to him, and he could see their past, present and fu- ture. And that is the way all men in the holy priesthood should feel; and whether patriarchs, prophets, apostles or elders they should live so as to enjoy the spirit and power of their office and calling. This is our privilege, but we do not always live so; but this was the way with Father Smith. After I had been with Zi- on's Camp up to Missouri I returned east, and on my way I visited my father's household in Connecticut and  preached the gospel to them, and baptized my father and all who were in his house. In this I was blessed. I also baptized some of my uncles, aunts and cousins; but I left a nu- merous host that did not receive my message; they were not ready to re- ceive my testimony; a few of them did, and some of them have gathered to Zion. I have rejoiced in this and also in preaching the gospel to the world, because I have known that the gospel and the message which I had were from God. I knew then that they were true, and I know it to-day; and I know they will have  their effect on the nations of the earth.  The gospel which we preach is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, both high and low, rich and poor, Jew and Gentile. There is no man who will receive salvation without it; no man can re- ceive exaltation and be crowned with the fullness of salvation in the pre- sence of God without receiving the fullness of the everlasting gospel of the Son of God.  All men who have received a glo- rious salvation and resurrection and have gone to receive their reward in the presence of God, have had to go there by keeping the laws that He gave them. They have had to obey the gospel of Christ on the earth; they have had to receive the law and abide that law in the flesh that they might receive a fullness in the resur- rection. It will take just as much to save the Latter-day Saints and the inhabitants of the earth in this gene- ration as it did to save Adam, Enoch,  Seth, Moses, Elijah, Elias or Jesus and the apostles. There is no change nor variableness with the gospel of Christ; its ordinances are the same to-day, yesterday and forever. As the Apostle Paul said "If we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than that we have preached let him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8##]  This gospel has been revealed to us. We have received the light of it and rejoice in it. By it and its Author we have been sustained from the commencement until to-day. The gospel of Christ has never disap- pointed any man or woman that ever dwelt in the flesh. The God of hea- ven the Author of this gospel  has never disappointed any body who ever proved faithful to its pre- cepts. And if the inhabitants of the earth expect salvation through any other medium they will be dis- appointed. Whater salvation they may get, they will not be saved in the celestial kingdom of God. If  they have another glory it will be 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.  these valleys of the mountains, and they have become parents. I have seen some, and I will not say a great many, but I have seen some young men, I say nothing about maidens, who have met with untimely deaths and who have gone to the grave dis- graced, and a dishonor to themselves and to their parents. Circumstances of this kind are far more painful to any parent in the world than it is for their children to meet with sudden death by accident or any other way.  I do not make these remarks to apply to Brother and Sister Wheeler, for none of us know what course our children will take. We set good ex- amples before them, and we strive to teach them righteous principles, but when they come to years of accounta- bility they have their agency and they act for themselves.  Many things are transpiring in the earth to-day which we should regard as great calamities and as grievous to be borne if we had to pass through them. Think of these late earth- quakes in South America, eight thou- sand people out of ten thousand in one city sunk in the earth in a few moments. And then, the tremen- dous floods that are sweeping over France and other parts of the earth, causing the death of hundreds and thousands of men, women and chil- dren. All these things are in fulfill- ment of the revelations of God, and of the judgments which he has pro- mised should come upon the earth in the last days. One of the purposes which the Lord has in view in gather- ing his Saints to the valleys of the mountains is that they may not share in the sins or partake of the plagues of Babylon; therefore we have rea- son to rejoice before the Lord because of his mercies and blessings unto us. And with regard to a case like this before us this morning the loss of these children I want to say a few words for the consolation of those who are sorrowing. In the first place these children are innocent before the Lord; as to their death and the cause thereof, that is in the hands of God, and we should not complain of the Lord or his dispensations any more than Job did. These children have been taken away very suddenly, and in such a manner as to cause great sorrow and distress to their parents, but there is this consolation connected with the matter they are innocent, they are not in transgression. They have paid the law of death which God passed on Adam, and all his pos- terity; but when their spirits left their bodies and got into the spirit world their trouble and affliction were over. Their death was a very pain- ful one, but their suffering is now over, and in a few years from now they will come forth out of their graves in the morning of the resur- rection, not marred by fire or any ele- ment, but clothed with glory, immor- tality and eternal life, in eternal beauty and bloom, and they will be given into the hands of their parents, and they will receive them in the family organization of the celestial world, and their parents will have them for ever. They will live as long as their God lives. This, to  Latter-day Saints, who believe in the resurrection, should be a source of comfort and consolation.  Why our children are taken from us it is not for me to say, for God never revealed it unto me. We are all burying them. I have buried one- third of the children that have been given onto me. I have had some thirty children born to me, and ten of them are buried, all of them young. The question may arise with me and with you "Why has the Lord taken away my children?" But that is not for me to tell, because I do not know; it is in the hands of the 
 THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, ETC.  the glory of the law they keep in the flesh. If a man cannot abide a celes- tial law, he cannot receive a celestial glory, if a man cannot abide a terres- trial law he cannot receive a terres- trial glory; and if he cannot abide a telestial law he cannot receive a te- lestial glory, but will have to dwell in a kingdom which is not a king- dom of glory. This is according to the revelations of God to us.  Here is where we differ from the world of Christendom. Because we have received the Gospel in its full- ness and plainness, with its ordinan- ces, its organization, with the priest- hood with its keys, powers and bles- sings, its revelations and its light, truth and inspiration and its Holy Ghost. Everything which belongs to it in one age of the world belongs to it in another. In this the Gentile world lie in darkness; they have fol- lowed the same example of unbelief as ancient Israel, by rejecting the Gospel and persecuting the Saints, and putting them to death, and shed- ding the blood of the prophets and apostles and those who held the Gos- pel of the Kingdom of God in their day; and they have gone into the wilderness of darkness and unbelief, and remained so, until God restored the Gospel in this day.  Well, we as a people should rejoice in this Gospel, for in possessing it we are blessed above our fellow men. No matter what the feelings of the world may be, they do not make the truth of God without effect, not a bit of it. God has set His hand in these last days to restore Israel, and to call upon the inhabitants of the earth for the last time. Ancient- ly the Jews were called first. Jesus came to them his brethren first; the Gospel of the Kingdom was es- tablished, and the Church organized among them first; they rejected Him and put to death their Shiloh, their King, who had come to deliver them. He did not come as they expected; they looked for a King, a monarch, a leader, a warrior coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory to lead them to battle and to set up an earthly kingdom and rule and reign over them; they did not look for him to come as the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. They had not the light, and consequently rejected Him and His message and put Him to death, and the Kingdom was given to the Gentiles first to the Jews, then to the Gentiles. In these last days it came to the Gentiles first; and when they have proven themselves un- worthy, it will be given to the Jews. It is to the Gentiles that we have been called to preach the Gospel.  For the last thirty-eight years, since its establishment, have the El- ders of this church been laboring and traveling for the spread of the principles of this Gospel. You may track history from the days of the ancient patriarchs to the days of Jo- seph Smith, and you cannot find any account of men who have traveled as the Elders of Israel have. Jesus told His disciples to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every living creature, and he that believed and was baptized should be saved, and he that believed not should be damn- ed. But we can trace almost every mile of the travels of the ancient Apostles, and with the exception of Paul, their travels were confined to Asia, and chiefly to Jerusalem and Judea. But the Elders of this church have traveled in every gentile nation under heaven that would receive the message. And as a general thing the Elders have been faithful in this work among the nations; and we have not yet ceased to send them to the gentiles, and we shall continue to do so until they entirely reject the 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  Lord, and it has been so from the creation of the world all the way down. Children are taken away in their infancy, and they go to the spirit world. They come here and fulfill the object of their coming, that is, they tabernacle in the flesh. They come to receive a probation and an inheritance on the earth; they obtain a body or tabernacle, and that taber- nacle will be preserved for them, and in the morning of the resurrection the spirits and bodies will be reunited, and as here we find children of vari- ous ages in a family, from the infant at the mother's breast to manhood, so will it be in the family organization in the celestial world. Our children will be restored to us, as they are laid down if we, their parents, keep the faith and prove ourselves worthy to obtain eternal life; and if we do not so prove ourselves our children will still be preserved, and will inherit celestial glory. This is my view in regard to all infants who die, whether they are born to Jew or Gentile, righteous or wicked. They come from our eternal Father and their eternal Mother unto whom they were born in the eternal world, and they will be restored to their eternal pa- rentage; and all parents who have received children here according to the order of God and the holy priest- hood, no matter in what age they may have lived, will claim those chil- dren in the morning of the resurrec- tion, and they will be given unto them and they will grace their family orga- nizations in the celestial world.  With regard to the future state of those who die in infancy I do not feel authorized to say much. There has been a great deal of theory, and many views have been expressed on this subject, but there are many things connected with it which the Lord has probably never revealed to any of the Prophets or patriarchs who ever ap peared on the earth. There are some things which have not been revealed to man, but are held in the bosom of God our Father, and it may be that the condition after death of those who die in infancy is among the things which God has never revealed;  but it is sufficient for me to know that our children are saved, and that if we ourselves keep the faith and do our duty before the Lord, if we keep the celestial law, we shall be preserved by that law, and our child- ren will be given unto us there, as they have been given here in this world of sorrow, affliction, pain and distress. It has no doubt been a marvel many times, in the minds of men and women, why God ever placed men and women in such a world as is, why he causes his children to pass through sorrow and affliction here in the body.  The Lord has revealed something to us concerning this matter, and we have learned enough about it to know that this thing is necessary. We know that we are created in the image of God, both male and female; and whoever goes back into the presence of God our eternal Father, will find that he is a noble man, a noble God, tabernacled in a form similar to ours, for we are created after his own im- age; they will also learned that he has placed us here that we may pass through a state of probation and ex- perience, the same as he himself did in his day of mortality. And time and again it has been revealed in the revelations of God given in our day, as well as in the Bible and Book of Mormon, that these things are necessary in order to enable us to comprehend good and evil, and to be prepared for glory and blessings when we receive them. As the Apostle argues very strongly in the Book of Mormon  If we never taste the bitter how will we know 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  Gospel of Christ. How long that will be, it is not for me to say. The Lord is going to make a short work in these last days, He will cut short His work in righteousness. By and by the gospel will be taken from the gentiles and will be sent to every branch of Israel, and all will hear the sound of the Gospel.  We are called to build up Zion, and to establish righteousness and truth; called to build up the kingdom of God, and to warn the nations, that they may be left without excuse in the day of God's judgment and cala- mity. Now, the eyes of the Latter- day Saints, of those at least, who live their religion, are open. They understand the signs of the times. They are not walking in darkness; they should not be, at any rate. They should have the light, and understand the signs of the times, and know the signs of the coming of the Son of Man. The world does not under- stand these things; they did not in the days of Christ. They did not understand that Jesus was the Son of God, come to establish His king- dom and to deliver Israel, and they do not know it to-day; and that makes the difference between them and the Latter-day Saints. The reason of this is that they have not received the Gospel and the Holy  Ghost. They have not the inspira- tion of the Almighty. They have a spirit within them; but the in- spiration of the Almighty would give them understanding if they would embrace the Gospel. But being without the Gospel their understand- ings are not enlightened. They do not understand the scriptures, nor the signs of the times. They do not understand those principles which God reveals to those who keep His laws. This is the difference between us and the world.  We have an anx- iety for their salvation; so has our Father in heaven; but they must abide the law. The God of heaven abides a law, all the hosts of heaven abide laws; they are exalted and glo- rified by law. All the creations of God are governed by law. The earth abides the law for which it was created. I have many times said, and I think so still, that all the crea- tions of God, except man, abide the law. The beasts of the field, the fowls of the air and the fish of the sea all abide the law by which they were created. I do not know of any thing that breaks the laws of God but man, who was made after the image of God. And we as well as all the other creations of God must abide the law of our creation in or- der to receive a fullness of glory and blessing. This is the position we oc- cupy as Latter-day Saints. We have the Gospel, we profess to abide the law of the Gospel; and we should, as a people, be awake to the fact that our Father in heaven has done all He could for the salvation of the hu- man family. He has made known the laws necessary for the exaltation and glory of man, and has done all that can be done by law. We read that in Adam all died, and that in Christ all were made alive. Jesus has died to redeem all men; but in order that they may be benefitted by His death, and that His blood may cleanse them from all actual sin committed in the flesh, they must abide the law of the Gospel. The sins done through Adam we have been redeemed from by the  blood of Christ; and in order to ob- tain salvation we must be obedient and faithful to the precepts of the Gospel. I feel as though we as a people ought to rejoice; and we should prize these gifts and blesssings God has put into our hands, and we should seek to magnify our callings, and as a people fulfill the expectation of our Father in heaven, and the ex- 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.  how to comprehend the sweet? If we never partake of pain how can we prize ease? And if we never pass through affliction, how can we comprehend glory, exaltation and eternal blessings?"  The Lord has said concerning Jesus, that he descended below all things that he might rise above all things, and comprehend all things. No man descended lower than the Savior of the world. Born in a stable, cradled in a manger, he tra- veled from there to the cross through suffering, mingled with blood, to a throne of grace; and in all his life there was nothing of an earthly nature that seemed to be worth possessing. His whole life was passed in poverty, suffering, pain, affliction, labor, prayer, mourning and sorrow, until he gave up the ghost on the cross. Still he was God's firstborn son and the Re- deemer of the world. The question might be asked why the Lord suffered his Son to come here and to live and die as he did. When we get into the spirit world, and the veil is withdrawn, we shall then perhaps understand the whys and wherefores of all these things. In the dispensations and providences of God to man it seems that we are born to suffer pain, affliction, sor- rows and trials; this is what God has decreed that the human family shall pass through; and if we make a right use of this probation, the experience it brings will eventually prove a great blessing to us, and when we receive immortality and eternal life, exaltation, kingdoms, thrones, principalities and powers with all the blessings of the fulness of the Gospel of Christ, we shall understand and comprehend why we were called to pass through a continual warfare during the few years we spent in the flesh.  No.3.  It certainly does require a good deal of the Spirit of the Lord to give comfort and consolation to a father and mother mourning for the loss of their children; and without the Gospel of Christ the separation by death is one of the most gloomy subjects it is possible to contemplate; but just as soon as we obtain the Gospel and learn, the principle of the resurrection, the gloom, sorrow and suffering occasion by death are, in a great measure, taken away. I have often thought that, to see a dead body, and to see that body laid in the grave, and covered with earth, is one of the most gloomy things on earth; without the Gospel it is like taking a leap in the dark. But as quick as we obtain the Gospel, as soon as the spirit of man is enlight- ened by the inspiration of the Al- mighty, he can exclaim with one of old "Oh grave, where is thy vic- tory, Oh death, where is thy sting? The sting of death is sin, and the gift of God is eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ." ##1 Corinthians 15:55-56## The res- urrection of the dead presents itself before the enlightened mind of man. and he has a foundation for his spirit to rest upon. That is the position of the Latter-day Saints to- day. We do know for ourselves, we are not in the dark with regard to this matter; God has revealed it to us, and we do understand the princi- ple of the resurrection of the dead, and that the Gospel brings life and immortality to light. We have re- ceived the Gospel, and if we are true to the principles of that Gospel as long as we live, we shall be made partakers of immortality, exaltation and glory.  I know very well that the loss of their children in this terrible man- ner is a sad affliction to brother and sister Wheeler. It was a sad afflic- tion for Job when his children and  Vol. XVIII. 
 THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, ETC.  pectation of those who have gone be- fore us.  The ancients are not perfect with- out us, neither are we perfect without them.  The old prophets and apos- tles had their day to labor in warn- ing the world. Noah preached to the inhabitants of the world, and showed his works by his faith, though he did not save a great many. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Moses, Elias and the prophets, Jesus and the Apostles all had their day. Their work is finished.  They sleep in peace.  This is our day, and we should labor while the day lasts; by- and-by  night will come when no man can work.  We shall not have 365 years as Enoch had to prepare Zion for translation. [##Genesis 5:23##]  As I before remarked the Lord is going to make short His work, or no flesh can be saved.  There are great events at our doors, and the Saints of God should be on their watch- tower.  We should have our eyes, ears and hearts open to see, hear, un- derstand and receive the counsels and  reproof revealed through the mouth of the servants of God in our day.   The Gospel of Christ is one of the greatest blessings that can be be- stowed upon man.  Eternal life, the Lord says, is the greatest gift of God.  We can obtain that, only through obedience to this Gospel. This, brethren and sisters, is our blessing.  We possess it, and have been gathered here by it.  Had it not been for the Gospel we should still have been in England, the Uni- ted States and abroad among the na- tions of the earth, and Utah would have been a desert sage plain, inha- bited only by crickets and Indians, as it was when we came here.  The Elders of Israel might have preached until they were as old as Methuselah, and we should never have gathered had it not been for the inspiration of the Almighty.  You and I, and all who have received the testimony of Jesus Christ know that these things are true.  All the Saints of God among the nations, who have been faithful, have been inspired by the same spirit to gather home to  Zion.  Why have we gathered to Zion?  To fulfill the revelations of God.  Isaiah and Jeremiah and nearly all the prophets since the world be- gan have foretold the gathering of the people in the last days to estab- lish Zion, from which the law of the Lord should go forth to rule the na- tions of the earth, while the word of  the Lord should go forth from Jeru- salem.  We are here to do these things, and to receive teachings and instructions that we may be prepared for the coming of the Son of Man. We are here to be shut up a little  while in these chambers of the moun- tains, while the indignation of the Almighty passes over the nations. For this the Lord through his an- cient servant said, "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." [##Revelation 18:4##]  The question is often asked by sec- tarian ministers, "Why could you not live in New York, Liverpool, or London, as well as going to Zion? Because we should be in the midst of sin and wickedness and abomination, and it would be very difficult, while so situated, to keep from being pol- luted by the evils which reign upon the face of the earth at the present time.  And to overcome these evils we have been gathered together, that we may be taught in the prin- ciples of truth, virtue and holiness, and be prepared to dwell in the pre- sence of God.  When we embraced the Gospel we had only just begun our work.  Be- ing baptized into this Church is only like learning the alphabet of our

[##Job 1##] I will say to our morning friends, your children are taken away and you can not help it, we cannot any of us help it; there is no censure to be given to parents when they do the best they can. A mother should not be censured because she can not save her sick child, and we have to leave these things in the hands of God. It will be but a little time until they will be restored to us; in a little time brother and sister Wheeler will again have the children whose loss they now  mourn.  With regard to the growth, glory, or exaltation of children in the life to come, God has not revealed any- thing on that subject to me, either about your children, mine or any- body else s, any further than we know they are saved. And I feel that we have to put our trust in the Lord in these afflictions, we have to lean upon his arm and to look to him for comfort and consolation. We do not mourn under these afflictions as those who have no hope; we do not mourn the loss of our children, as though we were never going to see them again, because we know better. The Lord has taught us better, and so has the Gospel; the revelations of Jesus Christ have shown us that they will be restored to us in the resurrection of the just. And I will here say with regard to the Gospel of Christ, that it is one of the greatest mysteries under the heavens to me why there are so few of the human family, whether in the Christian, Pagan or Jewish world, who take any interest in eternal things, in the state of man after death. If we read the Bible we learn that Noah, filled with revela- tion, and with the Gospel in his hand, although he labored a hundred and twenty years, could not get a solitary soul except his own family to go with him for salvation. It was similar to the days of the Patri- archs and Prophets, and if we come down to the days of Christ, we find that his testimony was rejected by the rabbis, high priests and the great mass of the people, and he chose for his Apostles twelve poor fishermen, and they and very few of the people, comparatively speak- ing, were all that received the teach- ings of Jesus and followed him through the regeneration; while the whole Jewish nation, with these few exceptions, were ready to put their Shiloh to death, and he was the person upon whom the salvation of the whole house of Israel de- pended. It is just so to-day. The great majority of the people reject the words of life and salvation which are proclaimed unto them. God, in these last days revealed the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Joseph Smith by the teachings of angels out of heaven, and its principles are made known to the world, and there has never been a congregation of Gentiles, from that day to this, to whom the Elders of Israel have borne record of these things, but what the Spirit of God has also borne record of the truth of their testimony; and herein lies the con- demnation of this generation, for "light has come into the world, but men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil." ##Doctrine & Convenants 29:45## I ask, in the name of God and huma- nity, why is it that intelligent beings, 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES  mother tongue it is the very first step.  But having received the first principles of the Gospel of Christ, let us go on to perfection.  Brethren and sisters, let us lay these things to heart and try to rea- lize that the eyes of God, of angels, of those who have gone before us are waiting and watching for the comple- tion of our labors.  We have every- thing to stimulate us to action to do the will of God and overcome evil and be humble, obedient, diligent and faithful.  Let us labor faithfully while we dwell in the flesh, that we may be satisfied with our labors when we get through.  We have everything to encourage us here in the valleys of the mountains.  We have the bles- sings of God visible over us day by day in our preservation, and in the preservation of the crops and the fruits of the soil.  The hand of the Lord has been over the land.  Who would have been believed twenty years ago, if he had said that this bar- ren, desolate waste would have be- come like the garden of Eden?  It never could have been done except through the mercies and blessings of God.  His promises have been ful- filled to us, and we can just as well acknowledge His hand in these tem- poral blessings as in anything else, for the hand of God is in it all.  I pray that God will bless us with His spirit, and give us power to maintain our integrity, magnify our callings and to be faithful to our co- venants, to our God and to each other, that we may overcome the world, the flesh and the devil and be prepared to inherit eternal life, for Jesus' sake:  Amen. 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.  made in the image of God, take no interest in their condition after death? They know they are going to die, and, if they have any sense or reflection, they know they will live after the death of their mortal bodies; still men will sell their eternal inter- est for money, for a few hundred or a few thousand dollars they will sell all the interest they have in the eternal world; in fact, they take no interest in their eternal welfare. Their cry is "Give me gold, silver and honors the few years I spend here, and eternal life may go where it pleases, I have no interest in that." I ask again, why is it that the human family take no interest in these things? We have preached over forty years. I have been engaged in that work over that time, and have proclaimed the words of eternal life to millions of people, and have tra- veled more than a hundred thousand miles in so doing, and, as the Pro- phet has said, I have found one of a family and two of a city who have had eyes to see, ears to hear, and hearts to understand, and they have been gathered up from the various nations of the earth into the moun- tains of Israel, and here to-day we have a little handful of people, out of the twelve hundred millions who dwell upon the earth, who feel an interest in building out the Zion and kingdom of God upon the earth, and who are desirous to be saved in that kingdom.  Now I would rather be poor all the  days of my life, I would rather go through poverty and affliction, it matters not how severe, even to the sacrifice of my own life, then lose salvation and eternal life, because I have faith in it, and always had. I always have had faith in the Bible and in the revelations of God since I was a boy like these sitting on these seats, eight or ten years old, when I went to the Presbyterian Sunday school and read about Jesus Christ. I believed then that he was the Savior of the world; I believed that the Old and New Testament was true. I believe it to-day. What would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul? What will a man give in exchange for his soul? ##Mark 8:35-36## When he comes into the presence of God he can t buy it. This is the position of the world. There is none of us going to live but a little while; we shall all pass away soon, and our eternal destiny depends upon the few days, weeks, months or years that we spend here in the flesh. Do you not think it will pay a man or a woman to keep the commandments of God? It will, and when we enjoy the Holy Spirit, when we are trying to live our religion here on the earth, we are the happiest people on God's footstool, no matter what our circum- stances may be. I do not care whether we are rich or poor, whether in happiness or affliction, if a man is living his religion and enjoys the favor and Spirit of God, it makes no difference to him what takes place on the earth. There may be earth- quakes, war, fire or sword in the land, but he feels that it is all right with him. That is the way I feel to-day.  With regard to the Gospel of Christ, it is a thing that we should all labor to maintain the few years that we spend here. When I get through with this life and go into the spirit world, I do not want to miss what I have in anticipation. I have always desired to see the Savior, Father Adam, Enoch, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and those old Prophets we read about in the Bible. I de- sired this before I heard this Gospel, I desire it to-day; and I do not wish to miss this, for nothing in this world would pay me for such a sacrifice. But I know that it requires constant 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  warfare, labor and faithfulness before the Lord in order for us to keep in fellowship with the Holy Spirit, and to live in such a manner that we may obtain these blessings. Jesus says  "Strait is the gate and narrow the way that leads to eternal lives, and few there are who find it, while broad is the way that leads to death, and many there be who go in thereat." ##Matthew 7: 13-14## The road to death is broad enough to catch the whole world, and they do not like to walk in the strait and narrow one, they do not like to keep the celestial law. I have met with professed ministers of the Gospel, in my travels, at whose tables I have eaten and drank, and I have given them the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and have talked to, and labored with them, and I have known some of them spend days and days in this warfare, trying to decide which to do, whether to receive the Gospel of Christ, and take the reproach of the world, or reject it; and I may say that in nine cases out of ten they have come to the conclusion to reject it. When I visited Fox Island the first time, I went to the house of Mr. Newton, a Baptist minister; and I stayed with him. But first I went to his church, and heard him preach, and when he got through I wanted to bear record of the Gospel, for I had a message to that people, and I appointed a meeting for 4 o clock in the afternoon, and I ve preached the Gospel to them, and Mr. Newton took me to his home, and I gave him the Book of Mormon and the Book of  Doctrine and Covenants, and for ten days that man walked about his room until midnight trying to decide what he should do. The Spirit of the Lord bore record to him that my testimony was true, and he felt that if he obeyed the Gospel which I had proclaimed unto him he would lose his good name and honor among men, but that if he did not receive it, he would be damned. Finally he re- rejected it, and the consequence was that he became a vagabond, and a miserable outcast. I baptized all his flock who owned any portion of the meeting-house, and if he had embraced the Gospel and been gath- ered with them he would have been here and saved in the kingdom of God, instead of the vagabond that he has since become. I merely men- tion this to show how the minds of some men are acted upon by the tid- ings of the Gospel. Some of them feel that it would be a great reproach to obey the Gospel and to keep the commandments of God. Bless your souls, we who obey the Gospel of Christ are all in good company. Whenever you are persecuted for righteousness sake, said Jesus, rejoice and be exceeding glad for so perse- cuted they the Prophets and Apostles which were before you.  I will say to all, whether in the church or in the world, it will pay you to keep the commandments of God. Here is a man who has a wife that he thinks a great deal of; they have lovely children, and the ties of affection bind them closely. Now should not such a man have respect enough for God to keep his com- mandments, and so secure to himself his wife and his children in the celes- tial world after the resurrection? But you cannot get worldlings to believe in such a principal; the people, as I said before, have not in- terest enough in the things of the kingdom of God to be willing to keep the commandments of God.  I say to the Latter-day Saints, we should be faithful to our God. We are blessed above all the people that breathe the breath of life upon the earth, and we are blessed above all other dispensations and generations 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.  of men, for the Lord has put into our hands the power to build up his Zion upon the earth, never more to be thrown down, and this is what no other generation has ever been called to do. But although this is the mis- sion of the Latter-day Saints, we have a continual warfare to wage a warfare with the powers of darkness, and a warfare with ourselves. The ancients had a similar experience to pass through they had their day of trials, troubles and tribulations. Enoch labored three hundred and sixty-five years in building of Zion, and he had the opposition of the whole world. But the Lord blessed him so that he maintained his ground for that length of time, and gathered together a few out of the nations of the earth, and they were sanctified before the Lord, and he had to take them away, and the saying went forth  "Zion is fled." So you may trace down all the Prophets. Read the history of Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Isaiah and others, and you will find that it was a warfare for them all the way through. And so with Jesus and the Apostles. But all those dispensa- tions have passed and gone into the spirit world, and they have their eyes upon us, and in fact God our heavenly Father and all under him the whole heavenly host, have their eyes turned towards the Latter-day Saints, be- cause this is the great dispensation of which Adam, Enoch and all the ancient patriarchs and Prophets have spoken,  in which shall take place the final redemption of the House of Israel, the restoration of their king- dom, the rebuilding of their city and Temple, the restoration of their oracles and Priesthood, of the Urim and Thummim, and the preparation for the final winding up scene in the last days; all these things will take place in the dispensation in which we are permitted to live.  Let us, then, try and fulfill and perform our duties as good Latter-day Saints. Let us bear with each other s faults, and bear the yoke of Christ,  live our religion and keep the com- mandments of God. Let us try and bring up our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Let us set them good examples and teach them good principles while they are young. They are given to us by our heavenly Father; they are our king- dom, they are the foundation of our exaltation and glory; they are plants of renown, and we should strive to bear them up before the Lord, and teach them to pray to, and to have faith in, the Lord as far as we can, that when we are past and gone and they succeed us on this stage of action, they may bear off the great latter-day work and kingdom of God upon the earth. I do not believe that the day is very far distant when the revelations which God has given concerning the last days will have their fulfillment. I believe there are many children now living in the mountains of Israel who will never taste death, that is, they will dwell on the earth at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. I will acknowledge that there is a great deal to be done, and the Lord has not revealed to man the day or the hour, but he has re- vealed the generation; and the fig trees are now putting forth their leaves in the eyes of all the nations, indicating the near approach of the second coming of the Son of Man.  It is my faith that hundreds and thousands of the children that have been given to us will be alive in the flesh when Christ comes in the clouds of heaven in power and great glory. The Lord will not disappoint the inhabitants of the earth in these last days in regard to his second coming, any more than he has with regard to other great events and dispensations. 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  We live in a very different age and generation; we live in the day and time when God has set his hand to fulfill a measure of prophecy and revelation to man, in the great dis- pensation of all dispensations. As an individual I do not believe that many more years will roll over the heads of the inhabitants of the earth before the resurrection will be upon them, and then these children, which we are called to bury to-day, will come forth from their graves, clothed with glory, immortality, and eternal life. You may ask why I believe this. I believe it because the revelations of God say so. I read the Scriptures, and I believe that the revelations and prophecies therein contained mean what they say, and I also believe that the saying of every Prophet or Apostles spoken under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost will have its fulfillment, and, as Paul said, no prophecy of Scripture hath any private interpretation, but holy men of old spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. ##2 Peter 1: 20-21## They spake the mind and word of the Lord, and none of their sayings will fail to be fulfilled, for the Lord has said "Though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not fail, but shall be fulfilled." ##Doctrine & Covenants 56:11## That is the way I read prophecy and reve- lation.  The Jews will be moved upon by and by, and they will return to the land of their fathers, and they will rebuild Jerusalem. These Laman- ites here will receive the Gospel of Christ in fulfillment of the revela- tions of God. The Prophets which have been shut up in the north coun- try with the nine and a half tribes led away by Shalmanezer, King of Assyria, thousands of years ago, will come and remembrance before God; they will smite the rocks and moun- tains of ice will flow down before them, and those long lost tribes will come forth in your day, and mine, if we live a few years longer, and they will be crowned, under the hands of the children of Ephraim the Elders of Israel, who dwell in the land of Zion. And by and by the testimony of the Gospel will be sealed among the Gentiles, and the Gospel will turn to the whole house of Israel, and the judgments of God will back up the testimony of the Elders of this Church, and the Lord will send messengers who will go forth and reap down the earth. The unbeliever may say that what we term judg- ments have always prevailed more or less among the nations, and that God has nothing to do with them, they are all natural. Well, if they have always prevailed, they will pre- vail to a greater extent in these last days than ever before, until every- thing that God has spoken shall have come to pass. Judgments await the world, and they await this nation, and the day is at hand when the Lord will sweep the earth as a besom of destruction. In the vision which the Lord gave to Enoch, he saw the heavens weeping over the earth because of the fall of man; and when Enoch asked the Lord "When will the earth rest from under the curse of sin?" the Lord told him that in the last days the earth should rest, for then it should be redeemed from the sin, wickedness and abomi- nations that were upon it. The earth is now pretty near ripe, and when ripened the Lord will cut them off. These things are before the Latter-day Saints, but the world do not believe in them any more than they believed in the message of Noah or Lot.  Brethren and sisters, let us read the revelations of God for ourselves, and when we read them, let us be- lieve them, and try to live in such a 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.  way that we may be ready for what- ever dispensation the Lord may have in store for us, and so that we can acknowledge his hand as Job did, and not find any fault with him be- cause of his providence is towards us. If we cannot comprehend them now, we shall be able to do so in a little while. The Lord may have purposes in view in his dealings with us that we do not understand; I presume he has. In fact, the whole of the deal- ings of God to man are a mystery. There is a vail over the earth, and it is ordained of God that it should be so, for if it were not so, and if men could comprehend eternal things, as God comprehend them, there is no man on earth, no matter how wicked he may be, but what would be willing to keep the commandments of God, and to pass through any- thing that God ordained, for therein he would see there was salvation and eternal life. But God has an order in these matters, as he revealed unto Joseph Smith. He said unto Joseph  "I will prove you whether you will abide in my covenant; if you are not willing to abide in my covenant even unto death, you are not worthy of me." ##Doctrine & Covenants 98:14-15## And it is so with the Saints. If they are not willing to abide in the covenants they have made with God, even unto death if necessary, they are not worthy of him. Jesus laid down his life to redeem the world, and passed through suffering and affliction all his life in order that he might fulfill the mission which was given him. So it is with us. The Lord says "I am going to prove the children of men." There are a few individuals in this dispen- sation who will inherit celestial glory, and a few in other dispensations; but before they receive their exalta- tion they will have to pass through and submit to whatever dispensation God may decree. But for all this they will receive their reward they will become Gods, they will inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities and powers through the endless ages of eternity, and to their increase there will be no end, and the heart of man has never conceived of the glory that is in store for the sons and daughters of God who keep the celestial law. And yet God has a veil over all in regard to these things. The whole world will be judged according to the deeds done in the body, and they will inherit kingdoms according to the laws which they have kept, every man being preserved by the law which he has observed, and all will be saved in some glory, except the sons of perdition.  Now, brethren and sisters, the Gospel of Christ is before us. We are all passing along, and it will only be a little time before a good many of us will be on the other side of the vail. Our friends are passing off every day, and we look in vain for many with whom we have been fa- miliar in years that are past. If I go into a congregation of ten thou- sand and enquire for the Saints I knew in Kirtland, and request them to lift up their hands, it will be like a standard bearer on the mountains, there is only here and there one. You ask a congregation how many of them knew Joseph Smith, and it is  only here and there one, they are passing away to the other side of the vail. It is so with us all, we are hastening to the end of life's journey, and a good many of us are on the downward grade. I ask that what little time I live, I may keep the faith and have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit and the Saints of God, that when I get through I may be satis- fied with life, satisfied with my acts, that I may receive a welcome into the Kingdom of God. That is all I ask and all I labor for. As for riches and 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  wealth, I do not want them if they will damn me. I would like to have enough to clothe, shoe and feed my wives and children, and to make them comfortable, if I can get it honestly before the Lord; but I would rather myself and them be in poverty than to have wealth and be destroyed. Riches are dangerous unless we can use them so as not to destroy us; if we cannot use them to the glory of God and for the building up of his Kingdom, we are better without them. I do not expect to live a great many years longer. The young, the middle-aged and the old are dying off. For many years of my life the gospel of Jesus Christ has been a consola- tion to me.  I have spent a good deal more than half of my life in laboring in this Church. I labored to find this Church, I may say, from my child- hood up, and many a midnight hour have I plead with the Lord, in the wilderness, in the woods, and in my mill, and under various circumstances, that the Lord would let me find a people who contended for the faith once delivered to the Saints. I de- sired this from reading the Bible, and from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, for in the pages of that sacred book I learned that a people once lived upon the earth who had com- munion with God, and they had power to command the elements, and they obeyed them; they conversed with angels, and had the gifts and  graces of a religion which had power and salvation in it. I could not find this on the face of the earth. I prayed to the Lord to let me live to find such a people, and he promised that I should, and I have lived to find them. I have seen the faces of Prophets and inspired men, and it has been a great consolation to me. I have my failings and imperfections, and I expect that we are all subject to them, more or less. I want to overcome them, because I desire to partake of eternal life. I also desire this for the Saints of God and for the honest and meek of the earth every- where.  I have labored many years, and tra- veled without purse or scrip, preach- ed without money and without price, for the purpose of saving my fellow- men. I labor on Mount Zion to try and save the dead; I spend a good deal of time in this. It is a conso- lation to me, I pray God my heaven- ly Father to bless you and all the Latter-day Saints, and that he will give us enough of his Holy Spirit to keep us in the path of duty and rec- titude, virtue and righteousness, that we may be justified before him. I  pray my heavenly Father that he will bless Brother and Sister Wheeler in their bereavement, and give them his Holy Spirit, that, when they lie down at night and rise in the morning and miss their children they may feel to commit themselves into the hands of the Lord, and realize that their sepa- ration from their little ones is not for ever, but that in a little while they will be restored to them. This ap- plies to us all in the loss of our chil- dren. We lay them away in the grave, but they will come forth in the morning of the resurrection, and if we are faithful to the truth, we shall receive them and rejoice with them; and when we have passed through the sorrows of mortality and have the joy and glory of the celestial kingdom conferred upon us we shall then know that the afflictions of mortality have prepared us for and enabled us to ap- preciate the blessings which God has in store for the faithful.  May God bless us, and give us his Spirit, for Jesus  sake, Amen. 
 DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF,  IN THE MEETING HOUSE, KAYSVILLE, DAVIS COUNTY, SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 10TH, 1882.  (Reported by John Irvine.)  HARDSHIP THE HERITAGE OF THE SAINTS THE NECESSITY OF TRIAL FORGIVENESS OF ENEMIES INSPIRED DREAMS, "GET THE SPIRIT  OF GOD" THE GREAT WORK EXPECTED OF THE SAINTS LABORS  AMONG THE LAMANITES.  We have met again this morning  to hear and receive instruction and  worship the Lord and honor Him  upon this holy Sabbath day.  The heavens are full of knowledge, full of instruction, full of revela- tion and of principle and decree,  and I may say of judgment, all to be  made use of in their day and time, and we have a right to all the know- ledge, all the revelation, all the  principles of truth, that we can  claim by faith and diligence in serv- ing the Lord and in the performance  of our duty.  I look upon the Latter-day Saints as occupying a position, I may say  equal, at least, to that occupied by  the people of any other dispensation  that God has ever given to man. We are a blessed people; we are  favored of heaven and have received  at the hands of our heavenly Father  a great many blessings both of the  heavens and of the earth, and we, as  a people, should be grateful to the  Lord our God for the many kind- nesses He has bestowed upon us.  We live, in fact, in the dispensation  of the fullness of times, the last 
 dispensation in which the Lord will  reveal his mind and will to the in- habitants of the earth, the last time  in which the Lord will prune his  vineyard, the last time in which he  will set up his kingdom upon the  earth, establish His Church, and  build up His Zion, to prepare for the  coming of the Son of Man. And while we sometimes feel and have  felt in days that are past and gone,  to complain because we meet with  oppression, persecution and afflic- tion, yet I wish to say to my breth- ren and sisters that these things are  the heritage of the Saints of God. Any people whom God calls will  meet with opposition from those who will not receive the Gospel of  Jesus Christ. This has been the  legacy of the Saints of God in every  age from Father Adam down to  our own day. Those that live  godly in Christ Jesus must suffer  persecution. I believe myself,  from the reading of the revelations  of God, that it is necessary for a  people who are destined to inherit  the celestial kingdom to be a tried  people. I have never read of the  people of God in any dispensation  passing through life, as the secta- rian world would say, on flowery  beds of ease, without opposition of  any kind. I have always looked  upon the life of our Savior who  descended beneath all things that  He might rise above all things as  an example for His followers. And  yet it has always, in one sense of the  word, seemed strange to me that  the Son of God, the First Begotten  in the eternal worlds of the Father, and the Only Begotten in the flesh, should have to descend to the earth  and pass through what He did  born in a stable, cradled in a manger, persecuted, afflicted, scorned, a hiss  and bye-word to almost all the world,  and especially to the inhabitants of  Jerusalem and Judea. There was  apparently nothing that the Savior could do that was acceptable in the  eyes of the world; anything and  almost everything he did was imputed  to an unholy influence. When He  cast out devils the people said he  did it through the power of Beelze- bub, the prince of devils; when he  opened the eyes of the blind, the  Pharisees and priests of the day told  the man to "give God the glory; we  know this man is a sinner." And  so all his life through, to the day of  his death upon the cross. There is  something about all this that ap- pears sorrowful; but it seemed  necessary for the Savior to descend  below all things that he might  ascend above all things. So it has  been with other men. When I look  at the history of Joseph Smith, I  sometimes think that he came as  near following the footsteps of the  Savior (although no more so than  his disciples) as any one possibly  could. Joseph Smith was called  to lay down his life; he sealed his  testimony with his blood, and passed  through some serious trials and  afflictions. In section 122 of the  Book of Doctrine and Covenants  the word of the Lord given to the  Prophet while in Liberty jail the Lord showed him his condition  and position. He refers there  to the trials and troubles he was  called to pass through, and then  compares them with what He Him- self (the Savior) had to endure. He  says: ##[Doctrine and Covenants 122:7-9]## "And if thou shouldst be cast  into the pit, or into the hands of  murderers, and the sentence of death  passed upon thee; if thou be cast  into the deep; if the billowing surge  conspire against thee; if fierce winds  become thine enemy; if the heavens  gather blackness, and all the ele- ments combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of 
 ##[Doctrine and Covenants 122:7-9]## hell shall gape, open the mouth  wide after thee, know thou, my Son, that all these things shall give thee  experience, and shall be for thy  good. The Son of man hath de- scended below them all; art thou  greater than He? Therefore, hold  on thy way, and the Priesthood  shall remain with thee, for their  bounds are set, they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy years  shall not be numbered less; there- fore, fear not what man can do, for  God shall be with you for ever and  ever." The Lord showed him in  this revelation that these afflictions  were necessary. We have been  called to pass through trials many  times, and I do not think we should  complain, because if we had no trials  we should hardly feel at home in  the other world in the company of  the Prophets and Apostles who were  sawn asunder, crucified, etc., for the  word of God and testimony of Jesus  Christ.  How should we feel towards our  enemies? President Taylor of late  has called upon us, to exercise  towards them the same spirit that  was manifested by our Savior upon  the cross: "Father forgive them they know not what they do." We  should endeavor to exercise that  spirit. Our persecutors, those who  would seek to destroy us, do not  know what they do. They do not  comprehend us at all. Why, bless  your souls, if the veil was lifted from off the eyes of the President of the  United States, from off the eyes of  the members of the Congress of the  United States, and from off the eyes  of our enemies, if this veil were  lifted they would bow before the  Lord and plead for these "Mor- mons;" they would do this if their  eyes were open to see the future  consequences of taking a stand against this Church and kingdom. But there is a veil over their eyes,  because of their works of evil; and  the day will come when all peoples  will mourn who take a stand against  the kingdom of God, the Zion of  God, the Church of God, and the  Lord's anointed; unless they repent  they will, when they pass into the  other world, go into outer darkness,  where there is weeping and wailing  and gnashing of teeth. It is impos- sible, however, for the Saints of God  to inherit a celestial kingdom with- out their being tried as to whether  they will abide in the covenants of  the Lord or not.  Well, I feel we are a blessed peo- ple. We have prospered. The  Lord is fighting our battles. The  Lord holds the destiny of this nation  and all other nations in His hands. Our enemies can go no further than  He permits them.  We live in a day and time when  the Lord has decreed to set up his  kingdom for the last time upon the  earth. That is the reason we have  the privilege of building these  Temples and these meeting-houses  in the mountains of Israel. The  Lord has set his hand to establish  his kingdom according to his for- mer promises, and it is going to  prevail upon the earth. He has  told us to fear not our enemies;  that though earth and hell combine  against us, they shall not prevail, if we are built upon the rock of  Christ.  We have come to this earth upon a  mission; and we have been gathered  to the valleys of these mountains  that we may be taught and in- structed in the things of God; that we may magnify our calling before  the Lord; that we may become saviors  upon Mount Zion; that we may  have power to go forth and warn the  nations of the earth. I look upon  the mission of the Latter-day Saints 
 as being as important as that of any  people that ever lived in any age of  the world. I have often expressed  my views with regard to this. As  Elders of Israel, very few of us fully  comprehend our position, our calling,  or relationship to God, our responsi- bility, or work the Lord requires at  our hands. The Lord has given unto  us the Priesthood. This is conferred  upon us that we may administer in  the ordinances of life and salvation. But to enable us to perform our  duties acceptably, there is one thing  we need, one and all of us, and that  is the Holy Spirit. While in Winter  Quarters, President Young had a  dream in which the Prophet Joseph  Smith appeared to him and said: "Brother Young, you exhort this  people to obtain the Holy Spirit;  with it they can do anything that  is necessary; without it they cannot  build up the kingdom of God." In  one of my dreams while in Arizona,  I had the same admonition from President Young. I thought he  was attending one of our confer- ences. I said to him: "Can you  speak to us?" "No," he replied, "I  have done bearing my testimony in  the flesh; I have merely come to see  the people, to see you, to see what  you are doing. But I want you to  teach the Latter-day Saints to labor  to obtain the Holy Spirit. It is  one of the most important gifts that  the Saints of the living God can  possess. You all need this," he  said, "in order to build up Zion. If  you have not this Spirit the Spirit  of the Holy Ghost, the testimony of  Jesus, the testimony of the Father  and Son you cannot get along. But if you are in possession of this  Spirit, your minds will be open to comprehend the things of God." This is true. There is not a man in  this Church and kingdom to-day,  who, if he is in possession of this  spirit, will set his heart upon the  things of this world. Any man that  loves the world, the love of the  Father is not in him. We have  received something better than the  love of gold, silver, houses and  lands; we have received the  promise of eternal life. We have  had conferred upon us the eternal  Priesthood by which our heavenly  Father has created all worlds and  redeemed all worlds and has per- formed all his works from eternity  to eternity.  Then, we should labor to obtain  this Spirit while we are upon the  earth that we may overcome every  evil. We have a mighty warfare on  hand. We have to contend against  the world, the flesh and the devil. There are temptations that surround  every man and woman, that is, if  they attempt to keep the command- ments of God, and no man or woman  can inherit eternal life without  passing through this warfare in the  flesh. Other generations have had  their turn. As a people it is our  turn to-day. The old patriarchs and prophets have gone, their mis- sions are ended, so far as their testi- mony in the flesh is concerned; but  they were valiant in the testimony  of Jesus Christ; they kept the law, and they will inherit a celestial  glory.  I often reflect upon the promises  made concerning the Priesthood. The Lord, in a revelation upon this  subject, says, ##Doctrine and Covenants 84:33-41|Doctrine and Cove- nants, 33rd to 41st verses##: Whoso- ever is faithful unto obtaining these  two Priesthoods of which I have  spoken, and the magnifying their  calling, are sanctified by the spirit  unto the renewing of their bodies.  . . . All that my Father  hath shall be given unto him. Therefore, all those who receive the  Priesthood, receive this oath and 
 ##[Doctrine and Covenants 84:33-41]## covenant of my Father, which he  cannot break, neither can it be  moved." Now, I sometimes ask  myself the question, Do we compre- hend these things? Do we compre- hend that if we abide the laws of the  Priesthood we shall become heirs of  God and joint-heirs with Jesus  Christ? I realize that our eyes have  not seen, our ears have not heard,  neither hath it entered into our  hearts to conceive the glory that is  in store for the faithful. We are  placed in a position to be proven and  tried; we must be, we have been, we  shall be, until we get through with  our labors in the flesh. The Lord  told Joseph Smith that he would  prove us in all things, whether we  will abide in his covenant, even  unto death, that we may be found  worthy: "for if we will not abide in  his covenant, we are not worthy of  him." Jesus Christ abode in the  covenant; he kept all the com- mandments while he was upon the  earth. He even was baptized by the  hands of John, although it was  not for the remission of sin, but to  fulfill all righteousness. There was  no part of the Gospel that Christ  did not fulfill, and he called upon  Joseph Smith to fulfill the same. This he did. He laid down his life. He went to the spirit world, and he  is there watching over this people. He has power there, and so have our  brethren who have gone to the other  side of the veil. They are laboring  for us. They are watching to see  how we perform the work left to our  charge.  I hope we live our religion. I  hope we strive to keep the command- ments of God. We occupy a very  important position in the world. There are very few of the inhabitants  of the earth who are laboring to  build up Zion. There are very few, apparently, who are able to  abide the law of God. There are  very few who are willing to sacrifice  anything for eternal life and salva- tion, and thousands will have to  inherit a kingdom other than the  celestial.  Nevertheless, my brethren and  sisters, we are laboring and progress- ing in this work. Zion is advancing;  the kingdom of God is rolling on. The progress of this kingdom has  never stopped from the day of its  organization; it never will until  it has accomplished all for which it  has been organized and established  on the earth to accomplish. We have a great work to do. We are  commanded to preach the Gospel to  the nations of the earth. The  Elders of Israel have been doing this  for the last fifty years.  We are still  doing it, in the United States and  other parts of the world. We shall continue to labor among the Gen- tiles just as long as the Lord says  we must do so. But at the same  time we have now been commanded  to turn to a branch of the house of  Israel. Here are the Lamanites, thousands and thousands of them surround us. They look to us for  the Gospel of Christ. It is our duty  to go to them and organize them, and preach to them the words of life  and salvation.  Then, again, we have temples to build in our day and time, that we  may go into them and do a work  both for the living and the dead. Our mission is more extended and  extensive than we realize. There  have been no Prophets, no Apostles, upon the earth for the last 1,800 years, that we are much acquainted  with, except Nephi, who dwelt upon  this continent several hundred years after the death of Christ. There  has been no one upon the earth  with authority to preach the Gospel to the nations of the earth. Many 
 generations have passed away.   Many thousands of millions have  passed into the spirit world. We  are now at the end of the sixth  thousand years. We are bordering  upon the millennium. We are living  in the great and last dispensation,  in the which the God of Israel ex- pects us, his servants, his sons and  daughters, to perform the work  which has been left to our charge. It is our duty to build these temples. It is our duty to enter into them  and redeem our dead. Joseph Smith  is preaching to the spirits in prison; so are all the Elders who have died in the faith. There are millions of them there, and they must have  the Gospel offered to them. Joseph  Smith and others cannot baptize the  spirits in water, it is not the law;  but their posterity, their sons and daughters who are living in the last  dispensation, are expected to go into  these temples and there redeem their dead. This is a good work,  and it is a great blessing for men and  women to have this privilege. We have one of these temples finished,  and we are doing a great work in  that temple. A hundred and sixty- two thousand persons have been  baptized for the dead, and nearly  seventy thousand endowments have  been given in that temple. We  have only just begun this work. We want the Logan temple finished, as also the temple at Manti, that  the people may go forth and redeem their dead. Our forefathers are  looking to us to attend to this work. They are watching over us with  great anxiety, and are desirous that  we should finish these temples and  attend to certain ordinances for  them, so that in the morning of the  resurrection they can come forth  and enjoy the same blessings that  we enjoy. We are living in the  flesh and have the privilege of receiv- ing the Gospel of Christ for our- selves. Our forefathers had not  this privilege; and as their  posterity when we meet them in  the spirit world we shall have the  joy and satisfaction of knowing  that we did our duty by them while  here upon the earth. We occupy  a position in this capacity towards  them the same as we do to this generation. We occupy the po- sition of Saviors upon Mount  Zion.  There are a great many things I  might mention that are of interest  to the Latter-day Saints. We should humble ourselves before the Lord. We have been called to set our  houses in order, that we should seek  to obtain the spirit of the Lord that  it may enable us to magnify our  callings in the Priesthood. We are  under great responsibility. It won't  pay to apostatize; "there is no money  in it." Any man who receives this  Priesthood and tastes of the word of  God, and of the powers of the world  to come any man that turns away from these things, apostatizes, and  turns away from the Church of  God, shall not, in accordance with  the revelations of the Lord to Joseph  Smith, "have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to  come."  The Lord is laboring for his  kingdom. In his hands he holds the  destiny of this people and of this  generation, and if we will do our  duty he will sustain and uphold us  and Zion will not be moved out of  her place. I am anxious to see the  Latter-day Saints rise up and mag- nify their calling. We (the Twelve  Apostles, Seventies and others) are  called to go forth to preach the Gos- pel to the Lamanites and organize  them. I am glad of it. I have felt  for a long time that we should turn  our attention to them. They are the 
 literal descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the Lord is  working in their midst. The vision  of their minds is beginning to be  opened, and they are to be taught  the things of the kingdom of God. I  have thought sometimes that they  have more faith than the Latter- day Saints. I traveled among them  for one year in Arizona and New Mexico. I visited those that dwell  in the walled cities. They have some  seven villages on the top of a moun- tain from 500 to 1,500 feet high. One thing struck me very forcibly  while there. Although a good many  of these people are superstitious, some of them sun-worshippers and  so forth, yet they seem to be im- pressed with the idea that there is go- ing to be a famine. They have enough  grain and dried squash laid up to  last them for years, and they think the day is not far off when they will need that which they have stored up. Don't we believe that a famine will come? I know some of our sisters  are laying up wheat, I hope the  Relief Societies will continue to do  so, and the brethren should help  them. I believe that the Latter- day Saints ought to store up grain  against a day of want. The Bible tells us that prior to the coming of  the Son of Man there shall be wars  and rumors of wars, famines, pes- tilence, and earthquakes. All these  things will come to pass.  It is a good time with us. The Lord has blessed us. He has blessed  the earth for our use; and we ought  to dedicate our families, our fields, our crops, our herds, to God. We  should pay our tithing according to  the law of God. We should attend  to all the duties required at our  hands. We should not neglect our  prayers. Men should seek to enjoy  the spirit of God, and the fellowship of His Holy Spirit. We should seek  to do all the good we can, so that we  may feel satisfied when we get  through.  I pray God to bless you with His Holy Spirit; I pray that he will  give us power to fulfill our calling in  the Priesthood, power to build up Zion, power to finish these temples in which we may redeem our dead. This is my prayer in the name of  Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 146 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  THE PEOPLE ASLEEP--THOSE HOLDING THE PRIESTHOOD MUST MAG- NIFY THEIR CALLINGS OR BE REMOVED--THE SAINTS TO BE TRIED  EVEN UNTO DEATH.  Remarks by Elder Wilford Woodruff, Delivered in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, December 21, 1856.  We have some few missionaries re- turned very recently, and I wish to  notify them to meet with us on Tues- day evening in the Seventies' Council Hall; and we want all the Bishops  in the city, and the missionaries who have been apppointed to labor here,  to meet at the same place, on the same evening.  I attended the High Priests' meet- ing last evening, in company with  brothers F. D. Richards and Lorenzo Snow, and I want to say to all the  High Priests in this city, I want them  to meet with their quorum; and we are going to meet with you; the  Twelve will meet with you and with the Seventies, and I want every man who is a president of Seventies to meet with his quorum at the time appointed.  There was not more than  half the High Priests out last evening.  We are called upon to wake up and reform, and it makes me feel curious  when I go into the High Priests' meeting, and see not one half of them there when a meeting is held to pre- pare them to wake up the people.  I want this people to listen to what  they have heard to-day. I feel thank- ful to see brother Kimball again come into this stand. I expressed my feel- ings when I saw the sacrament re- moved from the table; I felt that it  was a loud sermon to this people; I said I knew not what would come  next; I thought likely the Presidency would be removed next from us, not that I expected they would die; bro- ther Grant, however, is gone; the  load he undertook to draw killed him, the same load that was pressing the President of this Church to the earth,  when Jedediah rose up to bear it off;  his spirit was strong enough, but as brother Kimball said, his mortal body was not strong enough to bear its weight. The First Presidency have not addressed this people but a little time since the sacrament was removed,  therefore I was glad to see and hear brother Kimball to-day.  Although Jedediah has been taken from us, that load, which in a measure has been removed from the Presi- dency of this Church, has not return- ed unto them, and I pray it never  may. When Jedediah M. Grant went forth among the people through the north country and this city to carry out the views of President Young,  and lifted up his voice like the trump of the angel of God, and called upon the people to awake out of their deep  sleep and repent of their sins and  turn unto God, the people were so sound asleep that they did not realize the importance of his mission; many felt that his labors and reproofs were unnecessary and uncalled for, the peo- ple did not know what he was doing. Had the vision of their minds been open as was brother Grant's, and those who sent him, they would have seen  and felt the importance of that mission.  I tell you the people have been asleep, and they are not yet half  awake, they have not more than one eye open, and not that quite; when  we hear such things as we have to- 
 THE PEOPLE ASLEEP, ETC. 147  day, this people have got to wake up to righteousness. I have lived twenty- three years in the Church, and I have been acquainted with Prophets and have heard them prophesy, and I  have not yet seen their words fall to the ground unfulfilled; and when they  speak Israel should hear and obey.  We have been called upon, some  of us, as missionaries to the people of this city, to wake them up. We shall  be among you, brethen, and we do  not intend to let you sleep. Brother Orson Hyde is with us to-day; he has had a dream which refers to the wheat and the thrashing floor. I am glad  brother Hyde is with us, and I want to say to you brother Hyde, in the  name of the Lord, wake up and rise up in the midst of your brethren the Twelve, and lead them forth into the field of labor, and we will stand by  you; if you will lead the Twelve,  brother Hyde, in the spirit and power  of your calling as an Apostle of  Jesus  Christ, you will see your brethren by  your side; we will back you up, and step forth and help to bear that  mighty load which has rested upon  the Presidency of the Church like a  mountain, and nearly crushed them to the ground.  As a Quorum we have got to more fully obtain the spirit and  power of our Apostleship and take  more upon ourselves the care and  burthen of the Church and Kingdom  of God than we have done.  The Twelve Apostles have got to rise up and magnify their calling, or they will be removed out of their  place. The High Priests, the Seven- ties, the Bishops, and every other  Quorum of the Church and King- dom of God have got to do the same, or they also will be removed; we can- not sleep any longer with the Priest- hood of Almight God resting upon us, and the work that is required at our hands. WE CANNOT SLEEP.  I do not wonder that calling on the people to wake up has killed one man,  and it will kill more if we do not re- spond to the call; mortality cannot  endure the visions of eternity that rests on them when they look on the Priesthood and see the position they  are in; it has nearly laid brother  Young in the grave; he felt he could not live until some man rose up and started the work of reformation.  I know it is my duty to wake up  and enter into the labors of my call- ing, and it is the duty of Elder Hyde, and the duty of every other man in  Israel that bears this Priesthood to do the same; it is our duty to bear  off that burden and labor which has been resting like a mountain upon  the leaders of this Church. I know  they have groaned under the load that has rested on them, when they have  seen all Israel going to sleep.  Let the Twelve Apostles, and the Seventy Apostles, and High Priest Apostles, and all other Apostles rise up and keep pace with the work of the Lord God, for we have no time to sleep. What is man's life good for, or his  words or work good for when he stands in the way of men's salvation, exalta- tion, and glory?  They are of no use at all.  As an individual I am determined  to wake up and do my duty, God  being my helper. I want to see bro- ther Hyde, who is the President of  the Twelve, walk into all these Quo- rums and attend their meetings, and  we will back him up; I want him to  lift up his voice like a trumpet and go to winnowing the wheat; it is for the Twelve to rise up and carry off the  load. The Seventies have got to walk  up in their place and do their duty.  I know God requires this at our  hands. The law of God, the holy Priesthood, and the holy anointing and washing, and everything else  that is holy requires it at our hands. I know this.  It is necessary to reform. The  question may be asked, what is the  matter? Why, we are asleep; if the 
 148 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  eyes of any man or woman is opened  as they should be, they could see the things of God as they are in one mo- ment; they would see there is a  necessity of waking up and doing something. Here is a great and  mighty dispensation committed into the hands of this people for the living and the dead; the candle of the Lord God is placed in these mountains  like a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid; the work is on your shoulders, ye Priests of the Most High God!--on you rests the salva- tion of this generation, and the Lord  will require this stewardship at your  hands.  The Lord has given you the keys  of the Priesthood with all the bless- ings pertaining to it--as great and as mighty a work as ever was committed  to any man on the earth, and that too  in the midst of the last dispensation  and fulness of times. The Lord re- quires us to prepare this generation,  both Jew and Gentile, either for sal- vation or damnation through the  proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus  Christ and the administering of the ordinances of the House of God,  and we go to sleep! The Apostles  go to sleep--the Seventies go to  sleep--the Elders of Israel close their eyes to slumber, and we the  only people God has on the earth,  upon whose shoulders He has laid the responsibility of performing this great  and mighty work!  Do you wonder that Prophets get  up here and chastise, and draw the  sword of justice and hold it over our heads?  I do not. I wonder that our  children at the fireside do not rise up  and prophesy, with a voice like thun- der and in flames of fire, unto their fa- thers and mothers, and unto the people of Israel. I know that the counsels we  have had here through the mouths of  the Prophets of God are just and true.  I know that the warning voice that  has been heard in this Stand, and the call that has been made on this floor  is necessary; and I do hope and pray God that we, as missionaries, will  listen to it. I want my brother mis- sionaries in the first place to wake up, and get aroused with the mantle of  salvation and Spirit of God ourselves, and get our own armor bright. It has been justly remarked here that we have got to labor ourselves until we get the Spirit of God, and then we  can walk out among the people and correct them; but if we as Seventies, as High Priests, and Apostles, and  Elders bearing the Priesthood, if we are resolved to set our hearts upon  things of this earth, without being  engaged in the interest of the king- dom of God, what can we expect of  the people? Not anything. I desire  that we may all wake up, and listen to the counsel of these men who lead us from day to day.  We have no time to lose to prepare  ourselves for the things that are com- ing on the earth; and who wants to lose his crown, his glory, and hope of  eternal lives that he has had in days  past and gone by receiving the Gospel of Jesus Christ?  No man that has  any portion of the Spirit of God. Let us rise up and magnify our calling, and labor before God until we can get the Holy Spirit, and until our prayers rend the vail of eternity and enter  into the ears of the God of Sabbaoth and be answered in blessings upon  our heads.  When shall the fire be kindled  in Zion?  I do not mean wild fire-- there is a true fire, and that is the fire we need to get, that is necessary  to kindle; and if we live up to our  privileges, do our duty, walk up to  the word of the Lord God, and mag- nify our calling, we do know that the blessings of God will attend us, and  the sinners in Zion will tremble and  fearfulness will surprise the hypocrite; and let what will come, all will be right with the Latter-day Saints. 
 THE PEOPLE ASLEEP, ETC. 149  There are great things awaiting us and the world--the Lord is withdraw- ing His Spirit from the nations of the earth, His sword is bathed in heaven and will fall upon Idumea or the  world; the seals are about to be  opened and the judgments of God  poured out upon the wicked, for the  cup of their wickedness and abomina- tions is filled to the brim and the  indignation of the Lord will be pour- ed out without measure.  Let the Saints read the revelations of God, and they will see that there are important events at our doors. Let us hearken and wake up, and be doing the things required of us. Let the missionaries first get their lamps  trimmed and burning, and then go  among the people, and go with the Spirit of God and the salvation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ; and let the  other Quorums do the same; and  when you do this you will see a re- form, and sin and iniquity cannot  abide in our habitations, in our wards, or in our city.  We have sin and sinners among us,  and what are we going to do about it? Why, we are going to try to live our  religion, and when we do that we shall do right. The business with me is to do right to-day, to live my religion to-day, and leave the events with God; He holds the destinies of  the nations and of all men; they are in His hand; He made the earth and  controls the children of men upon it.  Then let events roll on--if we are  only right, all is well. We have got  to be tried even unto death. The Lord says He will prove us, and see  if we abide in His covenants. There is where we have got to stand as a  people, not only our horses, and gold and silver, and land and houses, but  our lives have got to lie on the altar,  and when anything comes to test us, even at the stake of our lives, we  should be in the possession of the Holy Ghost not to flee from it, and  such will be crowned with the gift of eternal lives, exaltation and glory.  There is nothing to encourage a  man to draw back; there is nothing short of the most damnable principle that dwells in the spirit of devils that would tempt any man to shed the  blood of the Lord's anointed, yet men  will try to do it. There are men here to-day who will possess that spirit;  I believe it; they are in our city.  If they shed blood they have got the bill to pay.  Let the wicked and the un- godly, who will not repent, but fight against God, do their worst, their time  is short, and the day will come, and  that soon when they will be called to judgment.  I remember what Joseph said, a  short time before he was slain in one of the last sermons I ever heard him preach. Said he, "Men are here  to-day who are seeking my blood, and they are those who have held the Priest- hood and have received their washings  and anointings; men who have received their endowments." I saw the faces of those men at that time, and they had  a hand in slaying the Prophet. There  are men who now possess the same spirit and the same desire. There are men here, too, that have faith,  that have the Priesthood and the  spirit of it, and they will do their duty, and God will sustain them in  it, and He will sustain this Church and kingdom; let the trials of the Saints be what they will, the kingdom of  God is not to be torn down any more at all--it will not again be taken from  the earth until it is prepared to re- ceive Christ at his coming.  Let us prepare ourselves and do our duty, and let the High Priests and Seventies go to their meetings, and before you go there, go to work  and get the Spirit of God, that when you get there you may not freeze to death. And I want to have the peo- ple, when they come here, to get  enough of the Spirit of God, that 
 150 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.  when the Presidency rise in this  Stand they may give us what is in  their hearts. They are filled with  blessings for this people. All the trouble is our eyes have been closed, we have been in a deep sleep; let us wake up and attend to our duty, and make it the first business we do.  Those who lay their plans in secret chambers to seek the blood of the Prophets, will have their case attend- ed to by messengers on the other side of the vail, ministers will be sent to them who will render unto them a  righteous judgment there. I do not want to preach to them here, but to  those who want to be saved.  Go to, and if you have not the Spirit of God, make it your first busi- ness to get it, that your minds may be opened to see the things of God as  they are; it is your privilege and mine, that we may be prepared for what is to come.  That this people may repent of all their sins and wake up, and have  power to come before God that their prayers may be heard, be prepared to defend the kingdom and never desert their covenants and their brethren, or betray the Gospel, but overcome the  world and be prepared to become joint heirs with Christ to the fulness of the first resurrection which is prepared  for those who keep the command- ments of God, is my prayer in the  name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 INSPIRATION AND TEACHINGS OF THE SPIRIT.  Remarks by Elder Wilford Woodruff, made in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City; Sunday Morning, March 22, 1857.  When any of the Presidency of  this Church, or of the Quorum of the  Twelve, or any of the Elders rise in  this stand to speak, this people look unto them, and expect they will enjoy  the Holy Spirit sufficiently to say  something that will edify them. The  people almost unanimously look for  this. I will say, on the other hand,  that the Presidency, the Twelve, and  the Elders who preach in this house  expect that the people will have the  Spirit of the Lord, that they may  come to understanding; and this is  just as much required that they may  comprehend what is said unto them,  as it is required of the breth- ren who speak, to teach doctrine,  principle, truth, and the revelations  of Jesus Christ. When the minds of  the people are quickened and enlight- ened by the power of God and the  gift of the Holy Ghost, that they can  appreciate and prize the principles of 
 eternal truth and the revelations  which God has given through his  servant Joseph, or the things which  he has revealed during the past  winter through the mouth of his  servants unto the inhabitants of this  city, or those which he has revealed unto the inhabitants of the earth,  then they are prepared to be benefitted  by those blessings which are poured  out upon them. Any of you that have  experienced this blessing and I pre- sume that all have at times have been  astonished at certain periods of their  lives that there has been such a  difference in their minds. I know  this is the case with myself, and I  presume it is with others. There have  been times that the vision of my mind  has been opened to comprehend the  word of God and the teachings of his  servants. The vision of my mind has  been opened and quickened by the  power of God and the gift of the Holy  Ghost, so that when I have sat here  and heard the Presidency and the  servants of God teach the principle of righteousness and the word of God  unto us, I have felt the force, the  power, and the importance of these  eternal truths which they have pre- sented unto our minds, while at other  times the same truths may have been  taught, but they have passed off  without making the same impression  upon my mind.  We have, as brother Franklin says,  spent an interesting time the past win- ter. Much truth has been spoken: men have been inspired by the gift  and power of the Holy Ghost to teach  us the things of God; and this I  consider to be a matter of great  importance to the people. I consider  it important that we labour to obtain  that Spirit, to have it increased upon us, and carry it with us, that when we  hear teaching our minds may be  prepared to receive it. Why is it that this Gospel of the kingdom has been  preached to the world for twenty-five  years, and that there are but so small  a number of the children of men who  have received those truths, been  governed by them, and suffered them to govern one single act of their  lives? It is because their minds  have been darkened and have not  valued the Gospel, or considered the  consequences of rejecting it. It is  true we have a large congregation  here to-day, and that there are a  few thousands in these valleys and  throughout this Territory. Yet com- pare them with the masses of mankind, and how few they are. I am not  capable of making a calculation to  say whether there is one to five or ten thousand who have embraced the  Gospel. One of the old Prophets said  that there would be one of a city and  two of a family. This has been fulfilled  in many instances. When the Elders  proclaimed the Gospel unto you, those  of you who are here received that  word, meditated upon it, so much so  that you have been willing to forsake  all that you possessed and come to  Zion. The seed has produced good  fruit; it has caused you to come to  Zion; but there are millions of the  masses who heard the Gospel, but they  have hardened their hearts and dark- ness has taken hold of their minds, and hence they have rejected the  Spirit of God which has striven with  them: they, in acting upon their  agency, have given way to seducing  spirits and rejected the Gospel of  Christ, and consequently the Spirit of  God has been withdrawn from them;  and because of this the Lord has been  taking his Spirit from the nations of  the earth. We see the fruits of it. It needs no argument to prove a truth  so visible.  I will now say that inasmuch as  many of us have received the Gospel and gathered with the Saints of God, it is important that we labour to-day  that we live under the influence of that Spirit, that it may continue to 
 privilege to live in this way, that all  our time may be spent so that we  have a conscience void of offence  towards both God and man. When  we reflect on the day that is past and  see wherein we have done evil, we  should labour to improve and to  advance in the things of the kingdom  of God. I feel that in order for us to  prize the gifts of God, the blessings  of the Gospel, the privilege that we  have of building tabernacles, and of  living here in peace, and kneeling  down in our family circles in peace,  having in our society the Prophets of  God, men filled with wisdom, who are  capable of leading us to salvation,  and of leading us into the paths of  life, who do teach us the principles of  truth, which will lead us back to our  Father and our God, I say, when we consider these things we ought to  prize our privileges as Saints of the  Most High. Brethren, we must in- variably have the Spirit of God with  us, that we may ever be kept in the  line of our duty.  I feel to exhort you in regard to  these things, that we may prize those  blessings which God has given unto  us, and pursue a course wherein we  may be justified of the Lord. Now,  if we attempt to do anything that is  not right, the Spirit of the Lord will  not approbate us, but we shall feel condemned. The Lord has blessed  us during the past winter; He has  poured out upon us a great amount of  knowledge, wisdom, and treasures, that we ought to prize. Now, as the  spring is coming upon us, and as we  turn our attention to the plough and  to cultivating the earth, if we forget  our prayers, the Devil will take double  the advantage of us. We have re- newed our covenants by baptism, and  we have received great blessings from the Lord, and much of the Holy  Spirit has been shed abroad among  this people. And, as brother Richards  has said and I consider the counsel right we should not only reprove our- selves when wrong, but we should  reprove sin wherever we see it,  whether in ourselves, in our streets,  or in our quorums. We should always  show our disapprobation of those that  are wrong that are sinful and wicked.  I do not feel, this morning, like  occupying a great portion of your time, but I do feel that the Lord is gracious  unto us, and that we should prize  above all things upon the earth the  words of eternal life that are given  unto us. As long as we are governed  by the Holy Spirit, our minds are  strengthened, and our faith is and  will be increased, and we shall la- bour for the building up of the king- dom of God. And I pray that our  hearts may be inspired to magnify  our calling and the holy Priesthood, and honour God, keep his command- ments, and live our religion, which  I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 Bro Wilford Woodruff said Bro Snow has given us good counsel this morning We should  take a course to save ourselves to day. The Lord has said he would  prove us in all things  ##Doctrine & Covenants 98:14## We have taken many Lessons for the past 25 years. we should make up our minds to make the best use of the Lessons we are able to  We have a Years War, but it has been a Bloodless Wone. Prest Buchanan nor  Congress does not know us. I believe that Devil is a Christian & goes hand in hand with all Christendom, he is a Gentleman They would put Jesus Christ or any of the old Prophets or apostles to death if they were here, as they did anciently We have confidence in God & we know he is our friend & that he has sustained us We have not violated the Laws of God or man They are mad at us because we believe that Joseph Smith was a Prophet & that B. Young is his Successor. 
 The Army would have been swept out of existence had it not been for those who lead this people they are dictated by God, he rules all things for the good of Zion & will do it   Let us make the best use of the circumstances that surround us We should learn to be wise be prudent in all things. We took a vote a few months ago to burn our houses & cut down our fruit trees rather than have officers forced upon us contrary to our wishes. We intend to do so yet but do not apostatize if you have to go back for the Lord may accept of our offering (i.e) take the will for the deed. I think it would be well for us to have Sutlers to trade with the Soldiers for they have Sutlers to trade for them You may just as well have confidence with God if we please If we sell to our enemies let men be appointed to trade with them not evry one be running to them & thereby get into a row with them No one should be running to them for they are afraid of being contaminated &by us & we are  afraid being contaminated by them so we are agreed in this one thing. The Lord has a little more power than the Devil. Let us make the best use of the power that God has given us. We have bore oppression many times & now we are call d upon to sustain the Constitution of the U. S. we have done it & calculate to do it No one to have any fears of the Mormons for we are in the mountains & we can take care of ourselves but they should have fear for themselves for the  judgements of God will soon be upon them The cry is now Peace, Peace but we do not know whether that army is going in to winter quarters then it will do to talk about going back. But let us not be to hasty. when our Leaders go back & say to us Come back, then all right - Amen 
 Sunday Oct 17 [18]58 2 oclock  Bro Wilford Woodruff After so long a silence I feel glad to speak to you how much I shall say I know not the Question has often been aske when shall we have any more Preaching. There has been silence in gt S L City the voice of the Prophet has not been heard of late Truth is Truth to day & will be tomorrow the same Principles of Salvation remain the same in every age. if you or I ever saw any beauty in the gosple there is yet the same beauty yet, because of this Silence it is no reason that we should not live our religion those who wached over us once are still watching over us, we should Sow the Truth in all Sircumstances we are placed, there now seems to be now a sifting time there has been a strong infl- uance to Draw away men from the truth. god has revealed the fullness of the gosple by an angel: the greater the light the greater are our responsibilities there has never been a generation greater Priviledged than you this is a Dispensation of Dispensations god has through Prophet that he would restore again the gosple this is the same Holy Prieshood conferred upon Adam and the Ancients. This was not revealed to our fathers now because we have been placed in surcimstances shall we partake of them such as gold and silver. great is our condemnation if we turn away we profess to  have recieved a Dispensation of the Holy gosple we have now. Preached to allmost every Nation under heaven, & now shall we now turn away. I hope not though I often hear of some turn away. Well every man has he has his Agency yet god holds every man ns responsable. not man ought leave the comm andments of God.  it seems to me that this Church is making great progress, has much the last 6 months has it has any 6 months.  Did putting the Prophets of god in chains &c stop this work no it only helped 
 FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY POWER OF THE GOSPEL  CONSISTENCY OF ITS PRINCIPLES.  Discourse by Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF, delivered in the Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, July 27, 1862.  REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.  Brother Taylor gave us a very interesting discourse this morning upon the first principles of the Gospel, contrasting them with the religion of the Christian world, showing the authority by which they administered in different ages the ordinances of religion according to the traditions of their fathers. He remarked that the Elders of this Church went forth as the Apostles did in the days of  the Savior, promising to the people, on conditions of obedience, the gift of the Holy Ghost; and he remarked that no other people would do that, because they do not possess the authority to do it.  I do not know that I can spend the few moments that I may speak here, better than to read a little on the authority that we have for pur- suing this course. This portion that

 I am going to read, is the word of the Lord to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well as to the whole world:  "Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of Him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say, hearken ye people from afar, and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together; for verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape, and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated: and the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow, for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed; and the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my dis- ciples, whom I have chosen in these last days, and they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them.  "Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and my preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them to publish unto you, O inhabi- tants of the earth: wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what I the Lord have decreed in them shall  be fulfilled. And verily, I say unto you, that they who go forth, bearing these tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, to them is power given to seal both on earth and in heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious; yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day when the wrath of God shall be poured out upon the wicked without measure; unto the day when the Lord shall come to recompense unto every man according to his work, and measure to every man according to the mea- sure which he has measured to his fellow-man.  "Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the end of the earth, that all that will hear may hear: prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, for the Lord is nigh; and the anger of the Lord is kindled, and his sword is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall upon the inhabitants of the earth; and the arm of the Lord shall be revealed. And the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the Prophets and Apostles, shall be cut off from among the people; for they have strayed from mine ordi- nances, and they have broken mine everlasting covenant; they seek not the Lord, to establish his righteous- ness, but every man walketh in his  own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose sub- stance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon,  even Babylon the great, which shall  fall.  "Wherefore I, the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments; and also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which was written by the Prophets; the weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones; that man should not counsel his fellow-man, neither trust in the arm of flesh, but that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world; that faith also might increase in the earth; that mine everlasting covenant might be established; that the fulness of my Gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.  "Behold, I am God and have 
 spoken it: these commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner of their language, that they might come to understanding, and inasmuch as they erred it might be made known: and inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be in- structed; and inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that they might repent: and inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time: and after having received the record of the Nephites, yea, even my servant Joseph Smith, jun., might have power to translate through the mercy of God, by the power of God, the Book of Mormon; and also those to whom  these commandments were given, might have power to lay the founda- tion of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased, speaking unto the  church collectively and not individu- ally, for I, the Lord, cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance; nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven; and he that repents not, from him shall be taken even the light which he has received, for my Spirit shall not always strive with man, saith the Lord of Hosts.  "And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of the earth, I the Lord am willing to make these things known unto all flesh, for I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know that the day speedily cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own domi- nion, and also the Lord shall have power over his Saints, and shall reign in their midst, and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world.  "Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled.  "What I, the Lord, have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself: and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but all shall be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same; for behold and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit bearth record, and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen."  -[See ##Doctrine and Covenants 1:34-39|Doc. & Cov., pages 65-68.##]-  What do you think of that revela- tion, brethren? Does this look like a Yankee scheme, or something made up to cheat somebody? No, this is the word of the Lord; it is a sermon of itself. The Lord has sustained that revelation from that day to the present, and that is the reason why brother Taylor and the Elders of this Church go forth declaring the words of life, and they know that they have not taken this honor upon them- selves, but that they were called of God as was Aaron. [##Hebrews 5:4##] I do not care how illiterate an Elder in this Church is, if he has been faithful to his calling; it is a matter I care but little about if a man can neither read nor write, if he has been called and ordained to the Priesthood in this Church and king- dom by Joseph Smith, or any of those ordained by him to that Priesthood which was given unto the Prophet by Peter, James and John, who by com- mandment came and ordained him to  the Melchisedec Priesthood. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] John the Baptist held the Aaronic Priesthood, and the authority commenced there, and by those men that held the keys of the kingdom of God in former dis- pensations. It is that authority that has inspired this; it is this that has inspired the Elders of Israel from

 the commencement to the present day.  Why should the Elders and people now think it strange that those mes- sengers who have gone forth, shoulder- ing their knapsacks and travelling thousands of miles to preach the Gospel, should be the especial objects of his favor? The Almighty has proven them all the day long, and he has been with them, and in fact there has never been any portion of the Priesthood officiating in sacred ordi- nances but God has been with them. In this revelation the Lord calls upon his servants, and says, "I, the Lord, am willing to make this known to the children of men, that I have called my servant Joseph, that the world may be left without excuse."  Joseph Smith knew just as well as the Lord knew that he was called of God, and that he was called to per- form a work for the redemption of man. Has he ever disappointed any- body when he has made a promise to them? Has he ever disappointed a Prophet or lawgiver in any age of the world? No, never. But he has declared that the heavens and the earth shall pass away, but his word shall never pass away, but that it shall all be fulfilled. It is just so in our day. All the words which the Lord has spoken through his servants will be fulfilled to the very letter, whether those words are in reference to the salvation of the righteous or the condemnation of the wicked. Christ had his mind upon this point when he said, "Heaven and earth  shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away." ##Matthew 24:35|Matthew xxiv, 35.## Again, it is written, "For I will hasten my word to perform it;" [##Jeremiah 1:12##] and when the Lord spake through Isaiah upon this subject he said. "So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it." [##Isaiah 55:11##] The Elders go forth to preach the Gospel to the nations of the earth, knowing that the Lord will back up their word by the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost.  There is but one Gospel, neither will there be any other for the salva- tion of this, nor of any other world that we know of; but this we do know that this Gospel preached in any age of the world will produce the same effect. We also know that any man who receives this Priesthood, and is faithful thereunto, will receive the same blessings and power in any and every age of the world. On this account and for this reason, Utah  the valleys of Deseret are being filled with the children of men. The Almighty has sent his servants to preach the Gospel; they have not gone upon their own authority: had they done so, they might have called upon the inhabitants of the earth till dooms- day, and they would not have been suc- cessful, but this land would still have been a desert, occupied only by Indians and wild beasts. But the hand of God was with us, and hence we had no fear of telling the people our message, and now there are tens of thousands who know the truth as well as we do, for they have embraced the Gospel and received this testimony for themselves. There never was a man that embraced this Gospel, but has received this testimony of the truth, if he has done so in sincerity and in truth. The Lord has always been ready to redeem his promise, and in giving that testimony which was necessary for the establishing of them in the most holy faith.  The Lord has sustained us as a people in all places and under all cir- cumstances. We have gone forth as sheep among wolves; among a people full of tradition and superstition, and we have had all these things to cope with in our administrations among 
 the people, but the Lord was with us wherever we went, backing up our  words by the testimony and power of the Holy Ghost, and the people to whom we administered received the same testimony as had been given unto us.  We are beginning to realize that the things which the Lord has pro- mised unto us thirty years ago are now being fulfilled to the very letter. Is there much peace in the world of mankind? No, there is not: peace is fast being taken from the children of men. We are at peace in Utah, but let me tell you that the Lord has foretold by the revelations of Jesus Christ all these things that are now fulfilling before our eyes.  I copied a revelation more than twenty-five years ago, in which it is stated that war should be in the south and in the north, and that nation after nation would become embroiled in the tumult and excitement, until war should be poured out upon the  whole earth, and that this war would commence at the rebellion of South Carolina, and that times should be such that every man who did not flee  to Zion would have to take up the sword against his neighbor or against his brother. These things are begin- ning to be made manifest, but the end is not yet; but it will come, and that too much sooner than the world of mankind anticipate, and all those things spoken by the mouths of his Prophets will be fulfilled.  We are gathering together here for certain purposes understood and in the mind of the Lord, one of which is that we may be sanctified and pre- pared for the great work of the future. We have carried this work to the  various nations of the earth, and the people to whom we have preached have thought of us saying that there was no other Gospel than that which we had to proclaim, as was clearly and  demonstratively set forth to-day. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is perfect in all its parts. The words of the Psalmist David will apply to our religion, where he says: "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The  statutes of the Lord are right, rejoic- ing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb." [##Psalm 19:7-10##]  According to the vision of John the Revelator, there are to be "six hundred, threescore and six" [##Revelation 13:18##] false sects of religion: how many of these already exist is a matter of dispute among theologists, but I suppose that the number is nearly complete. Let me now ask if you think things look or indicate that these contending creeds are all of God. It is certainly not like the order carried out in the  days of Christ and his Apostles. It is much more like the confusion of the Pharisees, Essenes, Herodians, Sadducees and Stoics, for they had different creeds, principles and notions by which they were governed, and it is just so now with the sectarian world. It is composed of every sect and party that profess religion upon the face of the earth. But the honest in heart will be gathered out of all these creeds and systems and be brought home to Zion.  There have been thousands of men and women who have listened to the preaching of the Elders of this Church, who have not embraced it for fear of their good name; and there have been many clergymen who have listened attentively to the Elders of Israel, and they have spent days and nights in meditating upon the things of God, and studying what to 
 do, realizing within themselves that if they received this testimony they would be dishonored in the eyes of the world. They fear becoming a hiss and a by-word among the children of men in this generation. Hence the majority of them have rejected it.  Many celebrated men have investi- gated this subject, and far more of them have had fears that it was true than that it was false. I visited folks in Long Island in 1837; I talked with one minister named Newton, in fact I stayed with him some twelve days and preached the Gospel to him. He attended meetings, and finally became so that he could neither eat, drink, nor sleep, he was so troubled about the Gospel; but instead of em- bracing it, sent after a minister who lived on the south side of the island, for the purpose of having me put down or silenced. I persevered and soon baptized most of the members of Mr. Newton's church. Mr. Douglass, a Methodist minister of the south side of the island came, stayed a short time and then returned. I followed him home and succeeded in baptizing most of his church; and instead of these men getting any honor by opposing me they were both brought into disgrace. They lost their religion, their church and members, and were really disgraced. When I was there last, one of them was in the Peni- tentiary for one of the worst crimes that a man can be guilty of, except murder, and the other was travelling the streets peddling small articles for his bread. The chastening hand of the Lord will always follow those that oppose the truth of Heaven as revealed through the Prophet of God. This is in accordance with the experi- ence of all our Elders. The Holy Ghost has been with them to back up their words, and I can say for all that, we have not done a thing but it has been backed up by the power of the Almighty, so far as we have labored for the upbuilding of the kingdom of God.  In regard to holding office in the Priesthood, I can truly say that I never asked any man for any office in this Church, and I believe I never asked the Lord but once, and my asking the Lord came about in this way. I went up to Missouri in Zion's camp; I saw the Prophet every day, and I knew he was a Prophet of God. About this time I had a great anxiety to preach the Gospel; this desire increased upon me, and I finally resolved to ask the Lord to open my way, so I went down into a hickory grove and prayed, during which I asked him to give me the privilege to preach the Gospel. I prayed fervently to the Almighty to give me the privi- lege of preaching the Gospel of Jesus  Christ, and when I got through praying I started for the place from whence I came, and I had not walked more than about forty rods before I met a High Priest, and the first thing he said to me was, "It is the will of the Lord that you go and preach the Gospel." I told him I was ready and willing to do anything the Lord required of me; I was therefore ordained a Priest and sent to labor in Arkansas.  I will now name a circumstance which I have never named in public before. I went into Arkansas, travel- led a hundred miles out of my way to see a man that had embraced the Gospel some time before I went there. He was full of wrath and indignation when I went in; he railed against Joseph Smith, Bishop Partridge and Father Morley. The Lord showed me the night before that I had enemies in that town. I talked over my feelings with the brother who accompanied me, and he wanted to leave the town, but I said no, I would not go away, for I wanted to see what the Lord wanted of me. All the people were mad with rage, and we 
 could not get anybody to preach to; in fact they were all full of rage till they were mad with it. For some time I could not see my way clearly, but we finally called upon an old man named Hubbard, and engaged to go and clear timber. During the short time that we were employed at that the Lord sent me three times to visit that old apostate, and each time when I went there I could only bear testi- mony to him of the truth of the Gospel. When I went the third time he followed me out of the house as full of wrath as the Devil, and he had not followed me more than about eight rods when he fell dead at my feet. This is a short story and a very singular one.  At that time I had not power to lay on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, only holding the Aaronic Priesthood, but the Lord sustained me and his work just as well as if I had been an Apostle. We baptized father Hubbard and his wife, after which we went on our way rejoicing. The Lord has fed and sustained his servants, and manifested his power according to circumstances, and so he will continue to do through life to all that are faithful and true to their covenants.  When the United States sent an army to this land for our destruction, the Lord had his eye upon us for good and he delivered us from all our enemies. The wicked have designed our destruction from the first organi- zation of this Church and kingdom, but our leaders have been inspired by the gift and power of God. Who frustrated that army in their design? The Lord our God; and now the judgments that have come upon the nation in consequence of their treat- ment to this people, are a sore vexa- tion to them, but it is the hand-dealing of the Almighty and we cannot help it. Every Elder in this Church who lives his religion knows that this which is now transpiring is according to the mind and forshadowings of the Holy Spirit, and those out of the Church may know if they will. If persons will believe the Bible, the Book of Doctrines and Covenants, and the Book of Mormon, they can therein learn the fate of the world, for it is there pointed out in great plainness. Who can stay this war that is devastating the whole nation both North and South? No human hand; it is out of the power of man, excepting by the repentance of the whole nation, for they have shed the blood of the Prophets, driven this Church and people from their midst, yes, the very people that hold the keys of salvation for the world they have banished from their midst, they have turned those keys that will seal their condemnation, and for this the Lord our God has taken peace out of their midst. Will there ever be any more peace among them? No, not until the earth is drenched with the blood of the inhabitants thereof. When the spirit of the Gospel leaves any people it leaves them in a worse condition than it found them, the spirit of ferocity, darkness and war will take hold of that people, and the time will come when every man that does not take his sword against his neighbor will have to go to Zion for safety.  These things sound strange in the ears of our neighbors of the nation with which we are connected, but let me tell you they are strictly true. Remember Christ's words in regard to the temple, viz., "There shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down."  ##Matthew 24:2|Matthew xxiv., 2.## The Lord Jesus Christ is as truthful now as he was then, and no power can stay his hand. Have we any fears of the conse- quences of what will transpire? No, we have not, for we know that God is at the helm. 
 When this kingdom commenced it was like a mustard seed, very small, but the Lord has sustained it and he will continue to control it to the end of time. Although peace is being taken from the earth yet this kingdom will thrive and prosper until every kingdom and government shall be broken to pieces, and every power shall be subject to the God of heaven.  Here are Elders who are faithful and true who have preached the Gospel from Maine to Texas, and from the Atlantic to California, and the warning voice has been lifted in Europe and in the Islands of the Sea, and thousands have embraced it and been made to rejoice in the truth.  We know that this work is of God, and that it will roll forth and prosper though all the world oppose. War is only one of the troubles that the United States are going to receive; and I can further testify, that there is no nation that will escape the judg- ments of the Almighty. There is no ear but what has to be penetrated with the sound of the Gospel of Christ; and by-and-by the Elders of Israel will be taken from those nations where they are now preaching, and there will be another set of Mis- sionaries sent amongst the people; there will be the voice of lightning, the noise of war, and of all those judg- ments which have been enumerated and prophesied of since the begin- ning of time, and they will go forth among the nations until the land is cleansed from the abominations that now reign upon the face of the earth.  When this Gospel was first pro- claimed to the world, darkness covered the earth; and wherever this doctrine is preached by those having authority and it is rejected, that people become more dark than they were before, and go blindly along like the ox to the slaughter, and they will sooner or later be overtaken by the judg- ments of the Almighty.  This is the nature of our testimony, brethren and sisters, we know that this work is true; we also know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, and the Bible could not have been fulfilled unless the Lord had raised up Prophets to declare the everlasting Gospel unto the children of men; he never could have brought his judg- ments upon the nations until he had raised up those Prophets who were ordained to come and warn the world. The Lord is now doing this work of warning, first by his servants and then by his judgments. In speaking of the kingdom of God I will here remark, that it is always alike, or in other words it is always governed by the same laws, by Apostles and Prophets, and you cannot have a  Church of Christ without these officers; there never was such a church since the beginning of the world. If any person will show me a people that were acknowledged of God, who did not have Prophets to lead them, I will confess that to be something which I have not found.  Paul says, speaking of the Church of Christ, "And he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers." [##Ephesians 4:11##] Then, in another part of the writings of the same Apostle, he shows that with such an organiza- tion one part cannot say to the other "I have no need of thee," [##1 Corinthians 12:21##] but that all are necessary in the Church of Christ. It is just so with the gifts and graces of the Gospel. A great many of you have seen men without some of their limbs, and just as quick as I come to a man who has lost an arm I see it. I remember once seeing a man in London without any legs, dragging along as best he could, and of course it was very inconvenient for him to travel; but I will tell you one thing which I never did see, I never saw any man going around without any head. A man can live without arms 
 or without legs, but he cannot without a head, and it is precisely so with the Church of Christ; one is just as impossible as the other. No other order has been manifested in this our day. We have a Prophet to lead and govern this people; we also have pastors and teachers, the Holy Ghost and the revelations of Jesus Christ right from heaven unto us, and we are realizing every day the fulfilment of these things that are promised to the faithful.  Brethren and sisters, we ought to be truly thankful to our Father and God, for he has been merciful to us, he has bestowed upon us his Spirit so that our ears have been opened to hear and our hearts to understand and to rejoice in the good things of the kingdom of God. And how lamentable it is that so few in the present generation have embraced the fulness of the Gospel, perhaps not one in ten thousand have received the truth. The Jews have suffered long and grievously for their rebellion, and they will continue to suffer for some time yet, but woe unto the Gentiles when they reject the light that is offered, for when that stone, which is spoken of in Scripture, falls upon  them they cannot escape the crushing  power thereof, it will grind them to powder.  Let us be faithful, serve our God and trust in him, and then, through the influence of his Spirit we shall know the signs of the times, and be prepared and made meet for our Master's use.  I ask that this may be our portion, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE LATTER-DAY WORK.  77  REMARKS BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF, DELIVERED IN THE NEW TABERNACLE, SALT LAKE CITY, APRIL 8, 1872.  (Reported by David W. Evans.)  COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE LATTER-DAY WORK.  We have had a very good Confer- ence; we have heard a great deal of  testimony from the servants of the  Lord, and that testimony has been  true. The building up of the Zion of God in these latter days includes,  I may say of a truth, every branch  of business, both temporal and  spiritual, in which we are engaged. We can not touch upon any subject  which is lawful in the sight of God  and man, that is not embraced in our  religion. The Gospel of Jesus Christ  which we have embraced, and which we preach, includes all truth, and  every lawful calling and occupation  of man. One subject that we are  deeply interested in I wish to say a  few words upon. In the first place I wish to give notice in this stage of  my remarks to the members of the  Deseret Agricultural and Manufac- turing Society, that they are re- quested to meet, at the close of this  meeting, at the Historian's Office, to  appoint their president and board of  directors for the coming season, for  the times demand that we should  hold a State fair in this city this fall.  Strangers may think this a very  strange subject to present in a reli- gious meeting, but we are building  up the literal kingdom of God on the  earth, and we have temporal duties  to perform. We inhabit temporal  bodies, we eat temporal food, we  build temporal houses, we raise tem- poral cattle and temporal wheat; we  contend with temporal weeds, and with temporal enemies in our soil, and these things naturally give rise  to the necesssity of attending to and  performing many duties of a tempo- ral and arduous nature, and they,  of course, are embraced in our reli- gion. In building up the Zion and  kingdom of God in these latter days, our agricultural and manufacturing  interests are of the most vital im- portance; in fact manufacturing and  agricultural pursuits are of vital importance to any nation under hea- ven. Show me a nation whose people cultivate the earth, and manufacture  what they need, and I will show you  a rich and independent nation. Show me a nation that lives entirely  by mining and I will show you a  poor nation one that is ready to  run out and become obsolete. You  see this manifest in the history of all  nations under heaven. What gives  England her wealth to-day? Her  coal, iron, and the products of her  soil, in connection with her prodigious  manufactures; and it is so with all the nations of the earth. What  makes the United States what she is  to-day? Her products and the cul- tivation of her soil, and the constant  efforts she has made to supply the  wants of her people. Not but what
