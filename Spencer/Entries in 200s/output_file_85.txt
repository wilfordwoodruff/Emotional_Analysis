We lived  in a room 11x14 for some time. Then we bought the house consisting of two  rooms. The other room was 14x15 ft 6 in. When we obtained these two rooms  we felt we could breathe more freely. But when the summer came and we were cooking in this larger room, it was so hot that we  were being cooked with our food. The advent of Tilley and her  boys necessitated more room. Se we built a kitchen and bedroom on to our house of two rooms and now we are very comfortable But building in Mexico is an expensive luxury if one has the common necessities to produce light and air. In the Mex- ican houses they have adobie walls, mud roof, doors and   window shutters. Very little if any glass. I think I have  discovered why.

The  sun shines nearly all the time and the heat is very  oppressive. Yesterday was the 4th of July. We had no public  demonstration. We have only a few men at home. So many  on the railway and away freighting. Those who have  stayed at home are doing well. Their crops look well  and their trees growing. I think in the outcome those who  stay at home will be the gainers. We ^have^ had new potatoes  corn, beans, and peas already. Meat is scarce, although we  have some stock men who seem to think they are rich in cattle, but that is all. Very seldom kill any. Not  that we need meat. If we had it we would have to cook  and eat it or it would soon spoil. Our Fast Meeting was  well attended. It is almost like Sunday on Fast Day. In  the afternoon the Sisters of the Relief Society meet, and  we have a good Relief Society, some of the brethren generally  meet with them. In the evening we have a conjoint meet- ing of the Young Mens &amp; Womens Mutual Improvement Association All meetings well attended and very interesting. The  Saints feel well and we take our schooling and exper- ience as well as we can. We have some disagreeble things to meet sometimes, and some get discouraged &amp;  leave us. They do not give the Mexican Mission a very  flattering report. But those who stay seem contented  and happy. They trust in the Lord and seek His counsel. This class are contented to remain. The health of the colo- ny is improving. We hope soon to resume our Sabbath  schools &amp; Primaries. It is wonderful of so many sick how few  comparatively speaking have died.

I anticipate going shortly to make  another visit to the settlements and organizing  a want of an organization. Things generally are  improving. We have no trouble. The worst man  represented here by reports—Bro W. W. Galbraith said to me not very long ago—"President  Teasdale, anything I have, you want, if you  will only let me know, I shall be pleased  to let you have it"—from what I heard of  Bro Galbraith, I would naturally expect to  have had some trouble with him, but he  and his family have treated me with kindness  and respect. Instead of pushing him off or  treating him with coldness &amp; contempt, I have quietly labored  with him &amp; preached the gospel. You thought he might  be made a useful member of the community and  you were right in your impression. We all have our  peculiar individuality and the Lord has brought  us into His fold, peculiar though we may be, and gen- erally, the worst of us, can be handled with kindness  and consideration, can't we?

We could take care of you and Aunt Emma if she was with you and you could  have a rest here. The road between here and  Deming is not so bad. You would only  need to be out one night and then you could  sleep in a tent. The best rig in the place  would be at your service and willing  hands to take the best of care of you. And  how the children and young people would  delight to see and hear you. If you did  not like to travel in the heat of the day you  could choose a bright moonlight, as we  do sometimes and travel in the cool of  the evening and early morning and  take a nap in the day time a'la Mexican for that is the way they travel. We shall soon  have what they call the rainy season, which  generally follows this severe heat. There was a man &amp; family here called Allsworth who  had the credit of seducing and running away  with his neice—his brothers daughter.

Tooele Con- ference, and I went to Ogden and attended the young peoples Conference. There was a large attendance, the house being completely filled. We had a very interesting time so far as the meetings were concerned. The morning was occupied by reports and short lectures from various young men, on the subjects of the "Organiza- tion of the Church," "The Miracles of Jesus," "The Constitu- tion of the U. S." and the "Divine origin of the Book of Morm- on." The afternoon was occupied by administering the Sacrement, sustaining the authorities of the Associ ations, and a discourse by myself. So far so good, and I think you will accord with me in this, but now comes the subject which is the cause ENDENTRY  191. end of upside-down text   it desirable if you could consult with the Presidency of  the Stake and appoint a good man, one that would meet with the approval of the Societies and be sustained by them to fill the position" vacated by Jos. A. West. Agreeable to this instruction I "consulted with the Presidency," and to my surprise and disappointment I found they were not united and had never consulted together on this subject. The counsellors claimed that they had been ignored and slighted and the feeling ran high, and extended back to times past and other things. I found it impossible to reconcile them or to come to any agreement in the time which we had, and the only thing I could do was to propose a postponement of the consideration of the subject until some future time. Bro. Peery was eager for me to make the nomination myself and put it through. This I considered unreasonable and unfair besides being entirely opposed to the written instructions on this point, so I ref- used to do it. And told him I did not propose to carry his burdens for him. The instructions upon this matter, so far as I can recall them to memory ^is^ for the "Presidency of the Stake to appoint the Stake Presidents of the Associations subject to the approval of the High Council." ^&amp;c.^ This had not been done I therefore declined to do anything in the premises, and ad- vised the Presidency to go to work and carry out this rule.   and all the company I am your bro. in the Gospel Jos.

February, the subject of increasing the Capital Stock was referred to a special committee who have reported, recommending that the Capital be increased 2,500 shares, and that $135 per share be charged for this increase, $100 of which will be credited to Cap- ital Stock account, and the remaining $35 to Reserve Fund, so as  to place the new stock exactly on a par with the old, so far as reserves are concerned.   the Institution, it will be seen that we have a Reserve Fund of  $350,000, to say nothing of the extremely low valuation placed upon real estate and buildings and on our stock of merchandise; so I have no hesitation in saying that at $135 per share, it is under rather than over the actual value of the Stock. Our showing for the past year is a good one, as good as any we have heretofore  made, and we have every reason to believe that we shall continue to do a large and prosperous business, and I see no cause why we should not be able to pay as good dividends as we have heretofore done, after this increase has been added to the Capital Stock. It is proposed to allot this Capital Stock pro rata to our present stockholders in the proportion of 25 per cent of their present holdings, but no subscription will be received for fractional parts of a share, excepting from such as now own a fraction and desire to make up a full share.   enclosing with this, upon which stockholders will kindly notify the Secretary of the Institution whether they wish to subscribe and take ths additional stock or otherwise. It is important that the matter should be attended to by the stockholders as early as possible and the notification returned without delay. The new Stock must be paid for to the Treasurer of the Institution, one- half on or before May 1st, and the balance on or before Aug. 1st, 1891.     President.

With industry, so char- acteristic of our people, coupled with intelligent management, and  accompanied by the blessing of God, prosperity must necessarily attend  your labors.

If you yourselves have these desires  bur selors with the same feelings; and if you as a body of presiding priest- hood are united in your labors to this end you will have the power to  draw the people to you and guide them in the paths of righteousness; and  the evil one, who is ever on the alert to make inroads among the saints,  will not have power to divide or make headway against you. Without  being rigid or arbitrary you should make it a point to maintain, through  the co-operation of the general priesthood, as well as that of your  presiding officers, the discipline of the church, as this is the means  by which the saints are preserved from the wiles of the adversary.  morals of the people should be jealously guarded, and the name of God  should not be used in vain. These two things we would especially have  you impress upon your young men. And if, in the course of events,  culties arise among brethren, we hope they will make it a point to  settle the same in an amicable way without resorting to tribunals either  of the Church or State; and if possible to not let the sun go down  upon their wrath.   at long distances from each other and from houses of public worship, they  are necessarily deprived more or less of that education which is derived  from association afforded by settlement and town life. We trust that  the brethren so situated will, with their families, not fall into the  habit of working on Sundays; but that they will keep holy the Sabbath  day as we are commanded to do, and make it a point to attend meetings  and Sunday school.

A new generation is now upon the scene, and though they hear occasionally con- cerning the work of the pioneers and the difficulties they had to contend with, still, in this city particularly, their ideas are exceedingly vague respecting these matters, and the men and women who can give them information from their personal experiences are fast passing away.

They are public property and should, therefore, reflect  the general intelligence and ta regard will be shown in the beauty of their design, ventilation, &amp;c., by  obtaining the best available architectural ability in the preparation  of the plans. And we may add in this connection, that whatever you may  undertake in the way of erecting public buildings, inv able expenditure of means, should be done as much as possible within  your own resources, and not with the expectation that the Church may be  relied upon to make up deficiencies. Some of our stake and ward  officers have of late found themselves in the exceedingly unpleasant  position of being totally unable to meet public obligations contracted  by them without our knowledge or consent, ^and for the payment of which they themselves were held individually ^responsible;^^ and they have appealed to us  to help them to preserve their credit and maintain their financial honor,  while at the same time we were over-burdened ourselves. We have felt  that if brethren look to us for help for such purposes, they should  consult us before they involve themselves, and thus afford us an oppor- tunity of conferring with them as to the advis ings; otherwise they should depend wholly on their own resources. In  most of the stakes there is what is called a stake meeting house, a  building erected by the stake as a whole, which answers a good and  worthy purpose in the rich and populous stakes; but in newly organized  and sparsely settled stakes such a large central building it would not  be advisable to undertake to erect. We advise rather the erection of  commodious ward meeting houses and good boweries, so that stake con- ferences  held in the wards with bowery accommodations in the summer season, and ENDENTRY  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.

M. Steele. You also  did not know how that would be; such things had been done, but I did not know how  it would be again."   this subject; but I am not aware of any such sealings or adoptions in this Church.  I do not consider it proper for any such sealings or adoptions to be administered in  the Temples of the Lord. It is not any more proper for your sister to be sealed to  you as her husband, now that she is dead, than it would be if she were alive;  neither should she be sealed to your son, because such a marriage is too near of  ENDENTRY    to her living husband for eternity, and if she did not express any preference on  that matter other than the ones you mention, you should then make a choice in her  behalf, and have her sealed to some faithful man in the Church, either living or  dead, and have her children adopted into his family.       ENDENTRY  results will be altogether better by distributing the conferences in  this way than by holding them all the time at one place; and, besides,  the investment involved in one large central building would be spared to  you.   in regard to politics. You are doubtless already aware of the counsel  given to the presiding priesthood at the meeting held in October 1893  on this subject, and therefore all that we now need to say is that the  time which has expired since then has only gone to prove the wisdom of  the policy adopted by us on that occasion. It is true that some of our  brethren from a restless desire to do something for their party have  failed to strictly carry out the counsel given at the meeting referred  to; but it is a noteworthy fact that wherever this has been the case  the results have been anything but satisfactory. We mention this for  the purpose of reminding you that as a stake presidency or as individuals  you have no place whatever in the field of active politics unless there  be good and sufficient reasons to the contrary. In starting out in the  labors of your official career it is of the utmost importance that you  maintain the dignity of your high calling, and that your minds be free  from bias of every description; and this we are sure will be the case inasmuch as you seek earnestly to the Lord to know and carry out his  will. In this connection it may be interesting to quote to you one of  the significant sayings of the Prophet Joseph. There are three agents,  he taught us, at work on the earth—the Spirit of God, the spirit of  man, and the spirit of the Evil One. Brethren in the days of the  Prophet were deceived, and brethren all along the line since his day  have been deceived, and doubtless brethren will yet be deceived as  between the Spirit of God and the spirit of man, simply because they  have sought to carry out their own will and way, and to minister to ENDENTRY  servants of God and sh unselfishly for Zion, for the blessing and uplifting of the people whom  God has called you to preside over, you will be entitled to His Spirit  to inspire and guide you in all your labors, and you will never be  found at a loss to distinguish between that Spirit which emanates from  God, and that spirit whi you for the reason that whatever influence and power you may possess as  a presidency or as individuals are given to you of the Lord; and as God  our Father is a jealous God, so it becomes us his servants, in wh reposed a great and important trust, to be jealous also, that is, jealous  that all the power which comes from him to us, and through us to our  fellow servants, is used to his honor and to his glory, for the  building up of Zion, and the s   be pleased to see you, and shall be glad to hear from you at any time on  any and all important ma Praying the Lord to give you every needed blessing, we are, with kind  regards,     Geo.

I was sorry to learn, by  your remarks upon the resolutions of the 'Twelve' concerning your papers, which ap- peared not long since, that any of the saints  abroad were more apt to patronize the com- mon newspapers of the day, than yours: For  the important reason, that the church of Jesus  Christ of Latter Day Saints, has the words of  eternal life, and your paper, as it has hitherto  done, must continue to publish such portions  of them for the benefit of the saints, and the salvation of mankind, as wisdom shall, from  time to time, direct.   right to take and read what papers they please: But do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of  thistles? It certainly is no more than just to  suppose that ' what must such as profess to be saints think,  when they patronize the splendor of Babylon,  and leave the virtue of Zion to linger for want  of bread?   than vanity: the best of every thing, calcula- ted to happify man, and dignify society, will,  yea, must be in Nauvoo: and as the new com- mandment, given anciently was,  another home and abroad, will bear its own testimony;     the only paper that virtually sustains, accord- ing to the forms of Scripture and prophecy,  'apostles, prophets, evangelists and revelations —and what shall be said of him that is like  the 'Levite' passes on the other side of the  way. When we behold men who 'have borne  the heat and the burden of the day;' strug- gled against the popular opinions of a vain  world, the burlesque of a giddy throng; the  vulgarity of a self-wise multitude, and the false- hoods of what may justly be termed the 'civil- ized meanness of the age,' and not lend a help- ing hand? The ##Matthew 25|25th chapter of Matthew## con- tains the simple answer.   ist of old: 'How good and how pleasant it is  for brethren to dwell together in unity.'   that run down upon Aaron's beard, that went  down to the skirts of his garments, as the dew  of Hermon, that descended upon the mountains ENDENTRY  manded the blessing—life forever more! Unity   sustain the 'Times and Seasons,' they sustain  me, by giving a spread to the revelations, faith,  works, history, and progress of the church.— The brethren who conduct the paper have  been appointed to that important station be- cause they are worthy and well qualified, and  what a blessed sign of a faithful friend to God  and man is it, to see the charity of a brother  support his brethren as an evidence that he  means to pass from death into life?   Times and Seasons, are extracts of revelations, translations, or are the united voice of confer- ences, which like 'apples of gold in baskets of  silver,' are treasures more than meet for the  called, chosen, and faithful among the saints;  and should be more than  hunger and thirst after righteousness. As Nau- voo is rising in glory and greatness, so shall I  expect to see the Times and Seasons increase in  circulation by the vigilance of the elders and  saints—so as to be a herald of truth, and a  standard of pure and undefiled religion.
