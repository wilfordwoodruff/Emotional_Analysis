 Basalt Bingham Co Idaho  July 28, 1897    President Willford Woodruff  Dear Brother    In answer to the call made of me to take a  mission to the Indian Territory, I will say that  I am willing to go, and deem it an honor, and am   willing to go and do the best I can.    I will tell you my circumstances, I am a new  currer here, and am not fixed for winter, I have   not the means to fix a house to live in, because   I had thought to go this fall, as the Bishop had  informed me that my name was sent. So I  have been making arrangements that way.   Have sold my team, big brother and sister have   gone else where to live, and it would be much  easier for me to go this fall as I have the means  now to take me to my field of labor, and if it  would be agreeable with your feelings I would  be willing to go at that time.

Taylor's  Counsel I felt I would like to go as a pioneer  to Messa City Southern Arizona president  Taylor after takleking with me for some time  advised me not to go, he told me he felt  I was just the man he needed he told me he  had a very good mission for me to go to  England my native country.  I told him I-  thought he could not have chosen a weaker  vessel, as I had not been accustomed to-  preaching and I was naturally a little timid  in standing before a congregation. president  Taylor told me after I was ordained and set  apart for my mission my timidity would  leave me, and I would fear nothing not even  Death itself. he told me I would be greatly  endowed with Wisdom and understanding  and he felt that I would do much good:; Well  (what I wish to relate to you is this,)  I did  not obey his counsel but went on my own  account to Arizona. to try and make myself  a home.  I did not prosper.  so I cam back to  Salt Lake City, and I lost my peace of mind  and have gone down ever since, nothing I  put my hands or mind to do as prospered  since that time  the more I have tried to get  along in life the more I have been disapointed  and bewildered.

 Gospel, and theSaints, who are trying to live —  their Religion, who are trying to become pure in  heart, and I love the priesthood. and I feel  I will do nothing in the future without asking  Counsel of those placed over me. I was orda  ordained an Elder in 1872, but have neglected  my duties for years as my work was mostly  in the mountains, away from any Branch of the  Church.  I have belonged the 15th Ward for the last  year or so, I always loved to attend the services  in the Tabernacle. I went home to England to pay  my Relatives a visit last fall as I had not seen  any of my Folks for over 24 years.  I stayed  in England about 5 months, my Folks offered  me great inducements if I would stay amongst  them, but I could not stay away from Zion  so my Folks loaned me 18 pounds to pay my  Fare back to Zion. In the year 1871 I heard an  Elder preach the Gospel for the first time in  my life, I told the Elder I had been searching  the Scriptures for years, but he had told me more  in his one discourse than I could find by reading  the scriptures or dead Letter.  I told the Elder  I was willing to forsake all sin and obey the  commandments of God all the rest of my life  so the Elder Babtized me and confirmed me  that I might recieve the holy Ghost, I never felt  such a change as took place,  I felt I was cleans-  ed from all my sins.  I felt as pure as a Child  and my mind enjoyed such peace and my-  whole being was filled with the light of heaven  I went home retired to Bed fell asleep.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff then  asked as a favor of the wives, sons  and daughters, the family and   friends of Brother Hyde, to grant  him the freedom of making such  remarks as his spirit desired, and if  he did not manifest as much mourn-  ing as the occasion seemed to de-  mand, he hoped they would pardon  him, for the vision of his mind was  opened to behold both sides of the   vail.    Elder Hyde was one of the First  Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of  this dispensation. There had been   other quorums of Apostles, among   the Nephites on this Continent,  and in all probability among the  people of Enoch, as well as in the  days of the Savior, in Jerusalem,  but only a few more, if any, than a  hundred had occupied this import-  ant position among the many mil-  lions of men that had been   upon the earth from the founda-  tion of the world; Brother Hyde  was among that number. The first  Elders of this Church, with the  Prophet Joseph at their head were  now rejoicing, the heavens also,  with the prophets of every age and   generation, at the birth of Brother   Hyde in the spirit world. These  were the feelings that animiated  him as he beheld the mortal re-  mains of his brother; for he had  filled his mission, he was safe and  free, and had accomplished his war-  fare successfully, had been true and  faithful unto death, and he   would receive a crown of life.   He felt thankful for the liberty now  enjoyed by Brother Hyde, and   these were the reasons he did not  mourn his departure.    There was only one of the first  quorum of the Twelve now remain-  ing, and two only of the second  Twelve; such of the balance as  had been faithful were now enjoy-  ing a happy greeting with their  new-born brother in the spirit  world, and neither he nor they  would be willing to return if they  had the opportunity. He had  traveled with Brother Hyde up-  wards of forty-five years, and was   left the oldest member of the   Twelve now living. This admon-  ished him that his stay could not   be very long, and were it not for   the duties and obligations resting  upon him he would desire to leave.   As it was, he wished to stay and   finish the work allotted him. But  death had no sting for him. He   never felt to mourn the death of a   saint that had been true and faith-  ful, from the assurance the gospel  gives of their gain. The only cause   of mourning was the loss of their  society and the benefit of their as-  sociations to those who remained  upon the earth; but to them it was   most certainly a cause of rejoicing.  Brother Hyde had been faithful in  the midst of his brethren to the   last hour of his life. He was glad  of this, for henceforth a great re-  ward awaited him, and he would   reign in the celestial kingdom. He  had gone to prepare a place for his  family and his friends. He (Bro.  Hyde) was, and is, an apostle of our  Lord Jesus Christ, and he was well  satisfied with his career and with  his labors, for he had been moved   upon by the spirit of the Almighty  in fulfillment of revelation, to bear  his testimony of the fulness of the   gospel and also of the signs of the   times among many people, and he   had left that testimony to the   world, and in his office and calling  as one of the apostles of the Lord   Jesus he would be one of the  judges of this generation.    God had chosen the weak things  of the world to carry on his work,   and all that had been accomplished  had been through the spirit, power  and blessing of God attending those  whom he had chosen who were  faithful to their calling. The Lord  chose Brother Hyde to be an   apostle. He was faithful and dili-  gent in bearing record of the things  of God, on many missions and for a   great many years. His mission to  Jerusalem alone was sufficient to  hand his name down in honor to  future generations. How quick,   when the spirit, the immortal  principle departed, the mortal  tabernacle decayed! Nevertheless   that same tabernacle in which he  ministered to his family and the  children of men, will come forth  filled with immortality of spirit,  sanctified and glorified in the morn-  ing of the resurrection. He did not  deem it necessary to spend much   time to eulogize Brother Hyde, as   his labors were well known, and es-  pecially in that locality. He had  lived to a good old age, but it was a   short time compared with the end-  less ages of eternity. But the mode  and manner of our lives in this pro-  bation predicate our destiny in our   future condition. What manner of  people should we therefore be, to  make a good and wise use of the  opportunity afforded us! Whether  Brother Hyde's spirit was present   at these funeral exercises or with   his friends in the spirit world he  did not know, for it had not been  revealed. But one thing was cer-  tain, that the spirit of Brother   Hyde had with him all the bles-  sings, sealings and ordinances of  the new and everlasting covenant  that had been cconferred upon him  in the flesh, by men holding the  holy priesthood, and he will come  forth with his regenerated taberna-  cle and reign upon the earth with  his Redeemer, whose footsteps he  followed.    Elder Woodruff closed his re-  marks by giving comforting and  consoling words to the family of  the deceased, exhorting them to   be faithful that they might partici-  pate with him in the blessings of   the Father's kingdom worlds with-  out end. 
 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF  then took the stand, to make a few  remarks concerning the work of  mutual improvement. He looks for-  ward to great and important results  to be derived from these organisa-  tions in which the Lord has a hand.   Great responsibilities are resting up-  on the young men of Israel; they   will have to take the kingdom of  God on their shoulders and bear it  off. Hence they ought to lay to  heart the grandeur of their future   destiny.    The literary publication of this so-  ciety, the Contributor, edited by Elder  Junius F. Wells, is a good paper, ad-  vancing correct principles. The  speaker then contempates the ne-  cessity imposed upon each and every  one of us to maintain his own iden-  tity among the immense number of  human creations, the 1,400,000,000  constituting mankind. No man  should try to imitate any other, but  maintain his own identity. All the  Twelve have each his own original   life. So every one else should do.   Treasure up knowledge and informa-  tion, obtain revelations and divine  principles to guide you through life.   Be careful in not contracting any  evil habits, as it is so hard to get rid  of them. Take good, wholesome,  godly reading and eschew the evil  influence of the falsehoods and sick-  ly imaginations contained in those  imported story papers, novels and   similar enervating stuff which leads  the minds astray and fills them with  incorrect, unrighteous impressions.   Let us read history, learn of things  and events that are true and real;  but especially devote some portion of   our time in reading the revelations  of the Lord, so as to be armed  with the principles of righteousness.  A useful study are the lectures of  rhetoric by Prof. Blair of the Edin-  burg University, full of learning and   erudition, still, if our elders are filled   with the spirit of the Lord, they will  speak to interest all mankind, we  think, even possessing all those rules  of oratory. Above all these things  let us obtain revelations, the princi-  ples of the Almighty. In our church,  every man is a priest, a prerogative  denied all other generations of man-  kind to this extent. Every man has  some influence, especially the Lat-  ter-day Saints, and as far as we live  our religion, the blessing of the Lord   will attend us. The speaker is anx-  ious to see all the young members  become and remain righteous, virtu-  ous, true, temperate. Whenever he  feels moved upon by the spirit of  God to contemplate the great task   before us, he sees how the whole  spirit world, all the holy men who  ever dwelt in the flesh, are over us,  witnessing our doings and are lean-  ing on us. Great works are required  from us; so to build temples where to  receive sacred ordinances. Unfor-  tunately, some of our elders are dis-  regarding the word of wisdom, and  addict themselves to strong drink  which places them in an unpleasant  light before their heavenly Father.   We want to so inculcate such principles  in our families that we can be blessed  by reuniting with them in the morn-  ing of resurrection. We must pre-  pare ourselves to be strong enough  in the impending day of judgement  when God will pour out the full  measure of His wrath over the wick-  ed. The speaker closed by praying  the Lord to help all of us to lead   lives worth of eternal reward in His   holy presence Amen 
 Wm Hill  Dec. 31 [18]97. 
 Pres W. Woodward followed and bore his testimony  to the remarks of Brother Cannon, and stated that no  people, were more blessed than the saints were.  The Lord had raised up a people to whom he had given  his Kingdom, and that Kingdom would remain, when  all earthly Kingdoms would pass away and the   earth become a sea of glass and be celestial. He  referred to enoch and his people, and the circumstances   that was connected with their perfection, they became  so perfect that they could not remain here on the earth  and spoke of the great blessings, that God had plased  before us, no other people had been so favoured as to   live on the earth when God had established his Kingdom  never more to be turn down. he spoke of the opposition  that spray up in the earth when God revealed himself  to Joseph the Prophet, and spoke of the Law of Tithing and  remarked that the leaders of this church all pay their Tithing none  were more punctual in doing so than they. He spoke of the  propreity of all paying their tithing at the proper time and  according to the requirement. He spoke of the redemption of   the dead, and showed the necessity of Temples, in consideration of   which the Lord would enable us us to build and furnish our  Temples, that we may go on and officiate for our dead, a  great work remain for us to do, the departed dead are  awaiting anxciously to the completion of our Temple and stated  that the Temple in trust was appropriatly of 50 cents in each month  now for the Temple now in couse of erection. The Lord  was greatly blessing the saints in this Stake of Zion  and we should be thankful to him for all the blessings  we enjoy, and continued by saying that it does not pay  for men or women to apostitize, all who do so always fail  in their efforts.

 the other Brothern to  leave at that date  that will be as earley  as I can leave on a count  of getting means.    This is all at present, I   remain your Brother in   the Gospel,    William J. Chadwick    W D Robinson   Bishop 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff detailed the  circumstances that led to the events   that transpired on Fishing River, and   of the journey of Zion's Camp, and   there in their distress and poverty, the  elders consecrated all they had. The   Twelve and probably others did like-  wise when they arrived in the valley.    If we had remained in Jackson   County, half the prophecies of Isaiah   would have remained unfulfilled. We   are the descendents of Joseph, to whom  the promises were made, and the events   of our history have been for our good.   I believe that Joseph lived as long as   the Lord wanted him to, and that he   received every key pertaining to this   dispensation and conferred them on his   brethren, and that it was necessary   that he should seal his testimony with  his blood.    If our farmers had the spirit of some  of the Nephites of old they would dedi-  cate the ground and seed they sowed to the Lord.    In Salt Lake some of the youth were  visiting bad places, but in the Church   there were many young men who hon-  ored God. 
 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF    took the stand to address the Saints.   He had met with the people of Og  den many times before, but he had  not often had more occasion to feel  gratified. In several meetings, yes-  terday, he had been glad to witness   a good spirit and prayer meetings had  been organized. The speaker then  pointed out how by the principle of  faith the people of God had been   preserved in every age and time of   the world. He will always sustain   us if we exercise faith and obey His  law. Through faith the world was   created, Noah built his ark, Abra-  ham went he knew not whither, the  three youths were preserved in the   fiery furnace and Daniel in the lion's  den. [##Hebrews 11:7-8##] [##Daniel 3##] [##Daniel 6##] Without the spirit of the Lord  we can accomplish nothing, and in  order for us to obtain it, God has  conferred the holy priesthood upon   us. We must unite our hearts in a   feeling of harmony, in order to es-  tablish the Kingdom of God. In  various ages the Lord has visited the  wicked and iniquitous with His  punishments, while the people of  Israel were prospered and preserved  as long as they obeyed His law. In  the same ways the Father has dealt   with the human family and with  His elect people ever since. The   speaker knows of no generation that  has been blessed and favored with   such great privileges as we are in this  dispensation. Such indeed, was that  of Abraham, also those of the ancient  prophets and apostles. Jesus came  in the meridian of time that through  him all the human family should be  saved and redeemed, as through  Adam all had fallen and died. Elder  Woodruff here gave a sketch of the   Saviour mission of Christ. We know   that all these missions in the various  epochs of the world's history were  of God, some of the prophets having   been fore-ordained before they were  born, as were Jeremiah of old, and  the Prophet Joseph in the latter-  days. [##Jeremiah 1:5##] This the speaker illustrated   by the early history of the prophet.   The Lord always had a plan with  His creations, although the speaker  does not believe in predestination.   But there are noble spirits in the  spirit world and them the Lord has  sent to set up and establish His   Kingdom. The Lord raised up the  Prophet Joseph, He also raised up   Twelve Apostles, and every Latter-  day Saint. He has searched them  out from among all the nations of  the world and brought them hither  to assist in the building up of the  Kingdom. This kindgom is to stand  unto the coming of the Son of man.  We have all been called to assist in  it, from a thousand or fourteen hun-  dred million of people. Therefore  we certainly have nothing else to do,   no other business than to build up  this Kingdom; if we build it up, we  build up ourselves, and if we neglect   it, we fall. The Lord looks to no  other people than to the Latter-day   Saints to perform His work. Hence  we must be united in the gospel and  in the love of the Lord. For no  consideration we should sacrifice   our eternal salvation. Our aim  is high and glorious and our mission  is sublime above all others. If we   overcome our weaknesses, we will  have power to finish all our temples,   to dedicate them, to perform work  for the dead in them. We can enter   into the glory of God, be face to face   with the Heavenly Father, if we   keep the covenants. Let us, there-  fore, be one; be ready to forgive, let  us never think we have so much   dignity that we need no instruction  or chastisement. Let us be humble  and ponder what we are here for.   Earth and hell are against us, the   world hate us, and this is one of the   principal proofs that God is our  friend and will fight our battles, if   we are faithful to Him and His com-  mands.    The Lord wants us to spread  abroad, Zion's border must be en-  larged and her stakes lengthened.  Thus we are settling in Arizona; the   head and center of our settlements   there is St. John in Apache Co. Now   there are thirty families wanted from  this stake, to go thither to settle the  country, it takes men with means   to build up the country there and   secure a strong foothold in that part   of the country. The hives of Israel  are crowded and the bees are com-  mencing to swarm. 
 QUARTERLY CONFERENCE  Of the Y. M. M. I. A. of Weber County    APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF    gave utterance to the great pleasure  he had derived from the exercises  of the day. He also paid a tribute  to the efficiency of the services of   Elder Jos. A. West, whose absence  at this meeting he regretted. Re-  ferring to the testimonies borne by   the young Elders and their counsel  on religious topics, he compared  them favorably with the learned  rhetorical sermons which a Henry  W. Beecher and other worldly   divines might deliver, but without  interesting or edifying the Saints of  God.    The Mutual Improvement Asso-  ciations are powerful contributors  to the welfare of the people of Isra-  el and the promotion of the inter-  ests of the Kingdom.    Apostle Woodruff then declared  that there is no people on earth  that can less afford to waste time in  reading novels, stories, and other  trashy, valueless literature than the  Latter-day Saints. Their sole oc-  cupation should be the pursuit of   truth and the acquisition of knowl-  edge. If a Saint gets tired reading   the Bible and Book of Mormon, let  him obtain historical works, such  as Rollins' Ancient History, where  they can learn the ways in which  the Lord dealt with the various na-  tions of the earth in the days of old.  Many useful lessons can be learned  from the history of old Babylon,  Nineveh, Tyre, Sidon, Thebes,  Memphis, and other great and pow-  erful cities and peoples of ancient  days. Study of history is beneficial  because instructing, while reading  of fiction is detrimental, because de-  moralizing.    The work of improvement in  these associations is greatly needed  to assist in building up the last  Kingdom of God in the dispensa-  tion of times. Somebody has got to  bear it off amidst all these tremen-  dous events hovering on the thresh-  old of the future. It is our young  men that have got to do it, and  therefore the speaker takes a great  interest in their work. Joseph  Smith had all this in his mind and  he often spoke about the Kingdom  of God to be established in the   Rocky Mountains. How great and  astounding the contrast between  1847 and nowadays! And as it   grew and increased, developed and   progressed in the past, it will de-  velop and expand in the future, and  all the powers of earth and hell can-  not hinder it. This these young   Elders have to help bring about,  therefore they have no time to waste  in foolishness and idleness. They  are heirs of the priesthood and the  instruments in the hands of the  Almighty to accomplish His great  purposes.    He felt to say to the young men  and women, "God bless you!" They   would be clothed with power  and glory of God and would have a  great work to do amid all the wars,   bloodshed, pestilence, earthquakes,   tempests, and devastations about to  come. The speaker closed with a   prayer that the Lord may continue  to bless and prosper the associations  of the young. 
 Apostle Wilword Woodruff: The Lord   showed Abraham many noble spirits,   and said of them he would make the   rulers in his Kingdom. No generation   was ever called to do a greater work   than is required of the Elders of Israel   in these last days.    In connection with our duties to the   living is the redemption of the dead.    Because Congress is opposed to us, and   because our enemies are making our   overthrow we should not relax our ef-  forts, but we should continue our work   upon our temples, and inasmuch as we   are faithful, we will have power to fin  ish them and dedicate them, and work   in them.    Can the elders of Israel deny their   religion? Can they deny God? Can   they deny and desert their wives and   families that have been given them un-  der the law of God? No. Our ene-  mies may fine, imprison or put us to   death, but we cannot deny these things. 
 SUNDAY 2 P.M.    Opening exercises: prayer by Elder  John Van Cott. The authorities of the  Church and of this Stake were next  presented by Pres. Wm. B. Preston,  and sustained by the conference. Elder   Wilford Woodruff addressed the con-  ference. We should all see alike with  regard to the work of God. I have  never had any fears regarding this  work, and the fulfillment of revelation.  The Lord intends to fulfill all the   promises He has made to the children   of men. The Lord would not com-  mence such a work as this unless He  knew He had power to complete it.  He can build up this kingdom with a   few or with many. Our progress de-  pends upon ourselves to a great extent.   There have been few men in any age  who have had independence of mind  enough to live up to the requirements   of the gospel, and to make the sacrifices  it requires. Hence the world is  blinded, in regard to the gospel. A  man must be born of the Spirit of light  and truth before he can see this king-  dom. Hence the world are in darkness.  They will not receive the testimony of  the servants of God. If a man will  open his heart to the truth and ask  light of God, he will become born of  the spirit. When an elder of this  church rasies his voice in testimony of  the truth, the power of God accompan-  ies it, and the spirit of truth shows the  truth to the people, and when they re-  ject it the leaves them. The  reason why the Saints are here, is be-  cause they listened to the testimony of  the servants and Spirit of God.    Whatever law a person keeps, he   will receive the glory of that law, and   if he cannot abide the law of a kingdom  of glory, he cannot inherit such a king-  dom. When a person, a family, or a   nation rejects the gospel, the light  they have will withdraw from them.  Such men as Calvin, Wesley, and Luth-  er had been inspired of God, but they   did not establish the Church of Christ.   The Catholic Church held rule for  1,000 years, but it never had the priest-  hood. Such men as Wesley will hear  the gospel in the spirit world.    We have the Gospel, the Holy Spirit  and the priesthood. Would we sell  these things? Any man who ceases  his prayers is in danger. We should  labor, study, and read, and try to pre-  pare ourselves for our duties. The  present generations is very corrupt, and  the world is full of wickedness. Our  prosperity depends upon our own con-  duct, and if we will keep the command-  ments of God, Zion will not be removed   out of her place, and we will have   power to finish these temples and work  therein. If we would do right we would   have power to remain here. In no  generation has there been more testi-  mony and revelation than we have en-  joyed. As Saints we cannot magnify  our calling nor perform our duties with-  out the Spirit of God. When John the  Baptist, and Peter, James and John  visited Joseph Smith, it was not a vis-  ion. They came to him as one man  might come to another, and there was  no vision about it. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] The inspiration of   the Holy Ghost has strong a testimony  of the truth of this work as a man can  have. I have had no stronger testi-  mony than that of the Holy Ghost. If  we go to the prophets and holy men in  the spirit world, we will have to obey   the same law that they did. 
 The Daily Junction.    ISSUED EVERY EVENING.    (Except Sunday,) by     The Junction Printing Association1    (INEORPORATED,)    Office corner of Main and Fourth Streets.     Address all communications on business to the  Business Manager; those intended for publication  to the Editor.     MONDAY EVENING, JAN. 24, 1881.    QUARTERLY CONFERENCE    Of the Weber Stake of Zion, in Ogden  Tabernacle.    ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF    addressed the congregation which  was exceedingly large. Elder Wood-  ruff took up the subject of emigration  to Arizona. He said that all our la-  bor of settling Southern Utah and   Arizona had been accomplished un-  der great difficulties, many people  even despairing of the possibility of   redeeming the apparently sterile soil.  Brother Eldredge himself, when sent  on a mission thither, went and re-  ported back that "the country about  St. George stood all up edgewise."  Now St. George is a very garden of  Eden, producing excellent fruit.   There the Church has erected a Tem-  ple in which as many as 100,000 bap-  tisms have taken place. Difficult   also was the first settling of Arizona,   the first mission thither returning   unsuccessful. But others were sent  and now they have flourishing set-  tlements. However forbidding a   country may look to us, we can never  find a country more unpromising   than Utah looked on the 24th of  July, 1847, when first entered by the  Pioneers. Lot Smith was sent South  and he succeeded in establishing set-  tlements. There are Sunset and   Brigham City, on the two banks of   Little Colorado River. Elder Wood-  ruff then gave a description of the   country and how he found it himself.   When he went up the Little Colora-  do River, below Sunset, he found it  dried up for about 50 miles; but  when they got up to Sunset they  found water enough to run a grist-  mill all the year round and to irri-  gate 1,000 acres. There also was a   sufficiency of timber, as near as one  mile from Sunset. The country was  one field of bunch grass, for miles  and miles around, forming an excel-  lent herding ground. The people of   Sunset and Brigham had organized   in the shape of forts. They lived in   United Order, each settlement for  itself. They had fine herds of cattle,  both in the forts and on a dairy in a   fertile valley, called Pleasant Valley.   They raised all kinds of grain in  abundance and of good quality. In  the San Francisco mountains is a fine  forest of timber, from 6 inches to 4  feet thick and 50 to 150 feet high.   St. Joseph is 25 miles up the river;  25 miles further is Woodruff: 25 miles   more, up the river, is another place,  and several more in the vicinity. The   Little Colorado River furnishes am-  ple water for all purposes. Sunset  once looked very unfruitful; now  only 11 men and boys were employ-  ed at farming, harvesting thousands  of bushels of wheat and corn, the   finest ever seen in the West. The  Latter-day Saints there are able to  sustain themselves from the products  of the work of the soil. The United   Order is working most harmoniously,  no swearing, drinking or quarreling  going on. The Order shows most ex-  cellent fruits of union, peace, all the  people showing the greatest willing-  ness to obey the authorities and pay  tithings and donations. Elder Wood-  ruff then treated of St. John, the   county seat of Apache county, where  formerly all bad elements of the out-  side world would congregate—Jews,  Gentiles, Mexicans and others: The   Church now has bought the land   around there and emigration is   wished to secure possession. A good  man is placed in authority as Bishop,  a man who does right and just. Men  are needed to go there to help settle  the place which is the key to the   whole of Apache county. About 200  families are required, as it is a large   country, peopled by many thousands  of the Lamanites, located in villages,  all except the Navajos and Apaches.   These Lamanites are waiting for the   Latter-day Saints to come and ad-  minister to them. The Church wants  to settle Arizona, New Mexico, and a   whole chain of settlements into the   very heart of Old Mexico. St. John   is a very good place for farming, the  Little Colorado River flowing directly  through it: there is even a natural   dam of stone which enables the peo[-]  ple with little trouble and labor to   irrigate their lands. About 30 fami-  lies are desired out of this Stake to   go to St. John. But there is to be no  compulsion about it, all are to be  free about it. Those called upon to  go must consider their interest.   Prest. Taylor does not want to op-  press the people or to call them to go  against their will. All who like to go,  with willing hearts and ready minds  are expected to avail themselves of  the opportunities. There is one fine  stretch of land there, called the Col-  orado Meadows, from 15 miles long  to 3 or 4 miles wide. Elder Wood-  ruff wished the brethren to consider  the matter carefully and those who  are disposed to go and hand in their  names to the President and get ready  as soon as possible, as it is a long   journey, of about 700 miles. The   Latter day Saints want an outlet to  the South and the speaker hopes   that we will obtain a foothold in the   country of Mexico. There are tens  of thousands of the pure blood of   Lehi down there, whose minds are  open and eagerly awaiting the com-  ing of the Latter-day Saints. The   Navajos are our special friends and  many have been converted and bap-  tized.    Elder Woodruff then endorsed the  remarks made in the forenoon by  Elder Joseph F. Smith, about the   intents of the hearts of man. He  would never oppress or oppose any    whatever he pleased. The Lord Him-  self never forced any one to belief.   He has placed good and evil, faith   and unbelief before the children of  men and they can exercise their own  free agency. Such is also the spirit   of the Consititution of the United  States which guarantees full religious  freedom to all.    Another important point is the re-  demption of the dead. This is a   subject of momentous weight. There   are millions and millions in the   spirit world, for whom a work has to  be accomplished. It takes just as  much to save a dead man as  it takes to save a live one. Great   responsibilities are resting upon us,  to do a work for our numerous re-  lations in the spirit world. The   speaker then gave a touching de-  scription of the tender relations be-  tween children and their mother  and showed how great is our respon-  sibility towrds our fathers and our  fathers' houses. Elder Woodruff  himself has been baptized 3,000 times  for other people, which should be  an example to others. This will be  a great consolation and joy for him;   so it will be to all the Saints who   have done the proper work for their  progenitors and other kin. In the   spirit world we will only be privil-  eged to unite with those of our   friends whom we have redeemed   while in the flesh, hence we should  eagerly avail ourselves of the glor-  ious opportunity of the great and   mighty work.    The work of building temples is a   great and urging one. It is worth  more than all the gold and silver we  may obtain. There is no money in  apostatizing, or committing any sin.    If there is any glory, it is in men  who will stand up in defense of the  Gospel of Christ and when troubles  come will be found valiant champions  on the watch towers of Zion. In  such men Elder Woodruff glories,  as in Elder Joseph F. Smith, the son  of the martyred Hyrum. He is able  to preach the gospel of temperance,  because he himself lives it and he  nobly fills the exalted position to  which he has been called, and will  one day even occupy the highest.   The speaker concluded with a pow-  erful testimony to the great bless-  ings emanating from the Temples   erected to the name of the Most   High, and an impressive exhorta[-]  tion to the Saints to be solicitous  and eager in the fulfillment of all  the duties devolving upon us, at-  tending to their prayers, for then  the Lord would continue to prosper  and protect the people in peace and   plenty. 
 STAKE CONFERENCE.    The Semi-Annual Conference of   the Salt Lake Stake of Zion con-  vened in the Assembly Hall this  morning at 10 o'clock.    There were present on the stand,  President Wilford Woodruff, of the   Twelve Apostles; the Presidency of  the Stake, Angus M. Cannon, David  O. Calder and Joseph E. Taylor, and  others. Singing, "Let Zion in her   beauty rise," etc. Prayer was offered  by Elder Lauritz Smith.  Singing,   "Glorious things of thee are  spoken."    President David O. Calder was  pleased to meet with the Saints in a  Conference capacity, though there  were but few present. Spoke of the  importance of being punctual, and   where this was neglected in regard  to meetings it was generally an in-  dex of character in other matters  both of a spiritual and temporal  nature. The practice of punctuality   created a feeling of confidence   in us towards those who were   punctual, and as a rule those  who were the busiest and who  valued time the most highly would   be found the most prompt.   He regretted the indifference that  was exhibited by many of the  Saints in regard to such meetings,   as these, seemingly being lovers of   pleasure rather than lovers of God.   It came with a bad grace from the  Latter-day Saints to offer as an ex-  cuse for profaning the Sabbath day,  that they were so much confined  during the week, in view of the   many holidays we had, and the   healthy location and labor in which  the people were generally engaged.    The roll was called, showing two   Patriarchs and four Presidents of   Seventies present.    The 1st, 3rd, 5th, 11th, 12th, 13th  15th and 16th Elders Quorums.    All the Wards of the Stake were  represented by presiding authorities,   excepting the 1st, 14th and 20th   Salt Lake City, and the Mill Creek   and Granite Wards.    The following reports were read:    A Statistical report of the Stake  for the Quarter ending May 31st,  1882, showing a net increase for that  term of 168 souls.    Reports from the 3rd, 11th and  18th Quorums of Elders, and a Sta-  tistical and Financial report of Y.  M. M. I. Association, for the year   ending March 31st, 1882.    President Joseph E. Taylor spoke  of the necessity of such organization  of the Stake being represented in  iew of the importance of the busi-  ness transacted. The time had been  when the cares of the world would  not have caused the Elders of Israel  to forget an occasion of this import-  ance. Much had to be accomplished  by the people of God. The question  was who were expected to accom-  plish these labors? There were duties  devolving respectively upon every  branch of the Priesthood and every  member of the church, and the neg-  ligence of one affected the whole.  It was the duty of Presidents to   make themselves familiar with the  members of their repective quor-  ums, and they should labor with   the same interest that a father   would have for his children, with a   view to check wrong-doing and en-  courage righteousness, being ex-  amples themselves of the principles  they sought to inculcate. The duties  of each branch of the Priesthood were   clearly defined and if a man's whole  time was not occupied he should   first perform the duties of his calling  in the Priesthood, and the Lord   would bless his substance and pro-  vide abundantly for his necessi-  ties.    President Wilford Woodruff re-  lated an anecdote to show that the  people in many instances took more   interest in trifling matters than in   those of importance. There were   few who realized the importance of   our calling and position. The eyes   of millions in the spirit world were   upon this people as upon them de-  pended this work and the accom-  plishment of prophecies which had   been uttered by the prophets since   the biginning of the world and of  others yet to be revealed which had  been hid from the foundation of the  world. The Priesthood we held was   of the same nature as that by   which the worlds were created. In   view of the great responsibilities de-  volving upon us we could not afford  to neglect our duties. He testified   that he had found it easier to sup-  port his family since they had be  come numerous than when they   were but few. Thousands of this   people had been foreordained to  come and accomplish the labor we   were now engaged in. Referred to   the blessings restored to the Saints   in our day and the provi-  dences of God that had con-  tinually ruled the destinies of His  people. In view of the blessings   we enjoy and the responsibilities de-  volving upon us we should be care-  to keep our covenants and observe  the commandments of God.    Adjourned until 2 p.m.    The choir sang the hymn, "Guide   us, O thou great Jehovah."    Benediction by Bishop Isaac M.  Stewart. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said  that young men were taken from  the various vocations of life and  sent forth to proclaim the Gospel to  the people of the nations of the  earth in their own tongues. This  work was one that had been spoken  of by the ancient prophets, and no  one could reject it who could sin-  cerely believe the Bible. God had  restored the Gospel through the  Prophet Joseph strictly in accord-  ance with the prophecies uttered by  his servants anciently, and this  was the same Gospel that was  taught by them, and the  Church was organized in the  same way and by the   same authority as the Church of  Christ anciently. No man had au-  thority to administer the ordinances  of the Gospel unless he was call-  ed of God, and all promises or ordi-  nances made without that author-  ity would end with death. The  Saints had been persecuted more be-  fore the principle of celestial marri-  age was revealed than since. This  was the only principle by which we  could claim our family relationship  on the other side of the vail. The  Lord had verified the truth of the  testimonies of the Elders of Israel  to all who obeyed their words in   honesty of heart. We were engaged  in an important work and it be-  hooved us as Saints to keep our cov-  enants. 
 Pres. W. Woodruff next addressed the  meeting; he spoke upon the proper train-  ing of the young. He had no one to  train him in the gospel in his childhood  days. He spoke of the loss sustained by  our memories becoming forgetful of-  times neglecting thing of vital import-  ance. He spoke of the great labor de-  volving upon the Saints, in building up  Zion, and the temples, in ordaining for  the dead, and of their redemption. In   St. George, since the dedication of the  Temple, we had baptized for 150,000  souls. Our duty in the world was to  warn the people of the second coming of  the Son of God, to proclaim the fullnes of  the gospel to all nations. He spoke of   the far-reaching efforts of this work af-  fecting the past present and future. All   nations were more or less trouble to us.  He related a dream in which Prest.  Young appeared to him and told him to  teach the people to strive for the spirit of   God and be governed by it, if all had  His spirit none would apostatise and turn  away from God. We should labor for  the riches of the gospel. A few persons  had been gathered up here from the na-  tions to co-operate with the Almighty in  the great latter-day work. He referred  to the first time which he heard Joseph  the Prophet speak, when he declared  they little knew the greatness of the  work they were then laying the founda-  tion of. He also spoke of the salvation  of the Lamanites, and hoped all would  strive for more of the spirit. 
 APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF.    The speaker read a considerable  portion of the vision given to the  Prophet Joseph, in which was shown  the condition of the dead, and said:  Jesus knew that millions of Jews  would suffer the consequences of his  persecution and death, hence he was  willing to forgive his enemies. It  was upon this principle that the   prophets in ancient times were wil-  ling to forgive their enemies and seal  their testimonies with their blood.    The world are ignorant as to the   condition of the dead in a future  state, and what rewards and punish-  ments will be given. But we may  all know by the visions and revela-  lations God has given us what our  future condition will be. If you  know what law you kep, you may  know what your future state will be.    Our enemies ought to be patient  and let these "Mormons" alone for   a little while, for they will not be  troubled with "Mormons" nor po-  lygamy after death. The "Mormons"   are keeping a higher law than they  are, and after the judgement there   will be an eternal separation between  them and their opponents.    As the kingdom of God has con-  tinued to increase in the past the  howls of its enemies have increased  also, and as the kingdom continues  to grow in future, so will the wrath  of our enemies, and we will have this  warfare upon our hands until satan  is bound.    There is nothing concerning man   that I glory in more than to see him  valiant in the testimony of Jesus.    We should study the revelations  for they are profitable for our instruc-  tion and edification. It is an un-  speakable priviledge to officiate as  saviors upon Mount Zion. We are  gathered from all nations and stand  as the representatives and Saviors of  the dead of all nations.    There is one thing in connection  with this dispensation that always  gives me great satisfaction. It is   the great and last dispensation in   which God has decreed that His   church should stand and prosper.    We have far more joy than do our  enemies. We can offer up our pray-  ers at night, retire and sleep sweetly,   and we feel well, happy and con-  tented. 
 President Wilford Woodruff in   listening to the reports given to-day,  was reminded of the parable of the  ten Virgins. He felt that the time  had come for the Priesthood either   to magnify their callings or repudi-  ate them, for if there ever was a  time when the Priesthood should be  faithful, it was the present. They  possessed the keys and authority to  minister in the ordinances of the   Gospel for the living and the dead,  and such men had too much to do   to lend themselves to evil practices.  The Priesthood should be clothed  upon with the spirit of revelation to   direct them in the performance of   their duties. It was important that  all should be faithful in attending  their meetings and in the perform-  ance of all other duties, for this   work did not devolve alone   upon the leaders of the Church,   but each one had a work to perform.   Those who had passed through the  early scenes of our history as a peo-  ple were passing away, and it was  important that the Priesthood   should qualify themselves to carry   on the work. He felt especially im-  pressed with the importance of   building temples that ordinances  for themselves and thousands of  those who have passed away with-  out an opprtunity of receiving the  Gospel might be performed. He  feared that we did not realize the   importance of our callings. The  power of God that would exist in   the last days would be manifested   through the Priesthood. Joseph  was endowed with the spirit of his  calling which was also enjoyed by   those who succeed him. The   Priesthood should be selected from  those whose lives were devoted to  the building up of the kingdom. He   illustrated the mournful condition   those who denied the faith after  once partaking of the spirit of life,  while there were no happier people  on earth than those who were faith-  ful, no matter what their circum-  stances were, this was exemplified   in the indifference that was mani-  fested concerning the efforts that   were made to destroy this people.    He felt that there would be an   awakening among the people and  that the work of God would increase   until it prevailed in the earth. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said   the Church and kingdom of God   were organzied permanently, as also   the various aids pertaining to it. If   the associations organized to im-  prove the young were a benefit to   one they would be a benefit to all,   hence the young should avail them-  selves of their advantages, and he   would advise all the young to iden-  tify themselves with these institu-  tions, that they might grow up un-  der an influence that would enable   them to avoid the evils that existed   among us. He felt to encourage the   sisters of the Relief Societies, especi-  ally referring to their labors to store   up grain, for the day of the Lord   was at hand. The sisters were also   doing much good in many other   respects. The judgments of God, of   war, of famine and pestilence were   at our doors, and it behooved us to   prepare for those times.    Those who held the Priesthood   should be enrolled in some Quorum.    There was a mighty host in Israel   holding the Priesthood, and they   should be alive to their duties, that   the power of their callings might   attend, and Zion would   continue to grow and increase   in the earth. It was especially im-  portant that the young should grow   up in the fear of God. He concluded   by invoking the blessings of God   upon the Priesthood and all of the   institutions of Zion. 
 PRESIDENT W. WOODRUFF    next addressed the congregation,  expressing the great interest he takes  in the work of mutual improve-  ment. He had been greatly edified  by the reports of the young breth-  ren, to-day, and he derived great  consolation from the fact that the  young are doing so well in the work  of the Gospel. He rejoices in it,  the holy ones in Israel rejoice in it;  the spirits rejoice in it; for they   know that it is upon the youth of   Zion that the work of the Kingdom  will eventually rest. When the  Church was organized, it was or-  ganized to stay; and when the Y.   M. M. I. A. was organized it also  was organized to stay. The young   people have organized upon a war-  fare—the world, the flesh, and the   devil (and a good many devils, or   fallen spirits). This warfare our   young are expected to carry on. It   will extend, and there is nothing  more God-like than for our young  people, in midst of all the abomina-  tions of the world, to stand up  against them and fight them reso-  lutely. A great many of the old  soldiers of Church have passed,   others are passing away, and the   speaker desires to strengthen the  faith of his young brethren and  sisters. Zion is going to have the   victory, of this he feels assured.   There is a change awaiting Zion,  and a change is also awaiting Baby-  lon.    It is marvelous to see the position  of our Church to day with the   powers of all the earth and hell arrayed  against it. The only fear is that   the Saints might become proud of  their blessings and forget the Heav-  enly Father. We should be thank-  ful for our prosperity, peace, and  wealth, humbling ourselves before  the Lord and listening to His,   counsel; for He has set His hand   to the great work of salvation and   is going to accomplish it.    The speaker then gave the young  some excellent counsel, pointing out   to them what great things they  are destined in the near future.  Our people occupy the most pecu-  liar position of any in the world.  All the nations of the earth are di-  recting their attention towards  "Mormonism," and they are looking  forward to something to save them  from the impending universal crash.  Our young men will have to stand  amongst Kings and rulers, to give  counsel and warning; hence they   should cultivate gentility, good  manners, affability, "polishing"  themselves, so to speak, that they  may find ready reception and exer-  cise influence. In this respect  President Woodruff imparted valu-  able advice to the young, a good  deal of which was just as adaptable  to the elder ones, as for instance,  not to break into conversation but  to wait until a speaker is through.  Never, also, indulge in jealousy or  prejudice, whatever position we   may occupy. One-third part of   heaven fell on account of jealousy,  and we have to be very careful in re-  fraining from this evil spirit which   would ruin the best man in Israel  and never leads to anything but  quarrel and war. We should al-  ways be kind and forgiving to one  another, not speak evil of our neigh-  bors, but always keep before our  eyes the principle of the Golden  Rule: Do unto others as we wish  to be done by.    In regard to prayer the speaker  admonished the Saints to cling unto  the Lord. This is an age of infideli-  ty, when priests and people alike are  turning away so far from the Lord  thas they can no more believe in   Him. God never did anything ex-  cept He did it by revelation through  the power of the Eternal Priesthood,  and it is through the principles of the  Priesthood that man does anything.  Everyone can receive revelations,   although there is only one at a time  to be a lawgiver unto the Church.   The speaker here explained the keys  of the Melchisedek Priesthood, to   hold converse with the Father. But  also the Aaronic Priesthood has its  power with the Heavens, the keys of   ministration with the angels. If  we have not these blessings we fall  far short of our calling. We all en-  joy the privilege of calling on the  Lord and obtaining wisdom from   Him. That "still small voice" with-  in us is the spirit of God, guiding  and directing us in all things if we  hearken to and follow it. These  things our young should learn and  they should cultivate prayer, to be  in constant communication with  their Heavenly Father. We should  go to the Lord for all our needs and  wants. President Woodruff here  referred to the revelation of the   Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith  in answer to his prayer while in  prison. The Heavens are full of  revelations, and we have many of  them in our books which we should  study and ponder upon.    The Twelve Apostles have been  called upon to go to the house of  Israel, among whom the Lord is  performing His work, as the speaker  related by several instances lately  occured, in Arizona when Laman-  ites received ministrations. Among  them was a prophesy that a great  war was before this nation which  would extend all over the land; and  there would also by a great famine  after three years of plenty. The  Bible is full of famine, Brother   Kimbal used to preach famine, and   we should be prepared for it. Es-  pecially the sisters of the Relief   Societies should continue the good  work of laying up bread-stuff and   the brethren should help them in  it. The famine will come surely,   and so will war, and pestilence, and  earthquakes, and all the other judg-  ments of God. He holds us in His  hand and He also holds the Gentiles,  and hence we have the strength if  we are faithful.    We should also be diligent in se-  curing and saving a record of our   dead that we may go into the holy  places and redeem them.    President Woodruff concluded  his interesting discourse with an ex-  hortation to the young to be valiant  in the testimony of Jesus Christ,  that they may become joint heirs  with Him in Heaven; and with a  prayer to God that He may pour   out the Holy Ghost upon all His  Saints. 
 APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF  said: Sixteen years ago I visited  Logan with President Young. The   boys and girls turned out to meet us,  and we held a meeting in the Bowery.  President Young asked me to talk  I did so, and predicted that many  who were present would yet be per-  mitted to stand on top of a Temple  erected upon the bench overlooking  this city, and look down from thence  over tens of thousands of Latter-day  Saints, whose homes would be in this   valley. At that time, no one as far  as I know, had thought of erecting a   Temple there, but we see the predic-  tion fulfilled.    The speaker related a striking  dream which he had in Boston, in   the early days of the Church, in  which he saw the Saints assemble in  the Rocky Mountains, build a Temple,  and engage in sacred work therein.  In this dream, he also saw the Laman-  ites enter the Temple, and he beheld   them working in it. This dream was  had long before any one in the  Church, so far as was known, enter-  tained the thought of the Saints   coming to these valleys.    The speaker discoursed upon the  progress the work of God is making  in these montains, and exhorted the  Saints to be united in their political  as well as all their other interests and   affairs. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.    I listened yesterday with much in-  terest to the reports of the Bishops  and of the societies. The Lord has  said He would do nothing but He  would reveal his secrets to His ser-  vants the prophets. This dispensa-  tion is one in which will be poured  out the judgements of God upon the   wicked, it is a dispensation of the  peaching of the gospel to all nations;  the gathering of the honest and of  the pruning of the vineyard for the  last time. From the history of the   world we learn that value exalteth a   people but sin is a reproach to any  people. Sin has always overthrown  any nation that has practiced it. The  history of the children of Israel shows  in many instances the effects of sin.  The Lord would use a heathen king  or nation with which to Chastise  them when they did wickedly.    No man can even read in the scrip-  tures of any change in the ordinance   of the House of God. Adam and  Moses, had we been with them,  would have taught us faith in the Mes-  siah, and baptism for the remission  of sins, as ordinances of salvation.   Enoch, Abraham and all the ancient  prophets taught the same plan of  salvation as did the prophet Joseph   Smith. There has been no change  in those ordinances during the last  6,000 years.    In our day there have been the   most wonderful discoveries and in-  ventions ever brought forth in any  age. It was in the year 1807, the   year in which I was born, that steam-  boats were invented by Fulton and  now the ocean is covered with them.   In what age before this was such a   thing as a car propelled by steam  seen? Isaiah saw one in vision bear-  ing the Saints to the mountains, but  no man before our age ever saw such  a thing except in a vision.    In this same age among all these  wonderful inventions and discoveries  we have a new religion or rather a  new covenant. The Lord has brought   forth a prophet and called forth his  church out of the wilderness to be  established in these mountains. The  descendants of Israel, of Ephraim,  who have been scattered and sifted   among the nations, are being gather-  ed out. This is the work of the  Lord and not of man; conceived in  the mind of the Lord, and brought   forth according to His will. Satan   knows that by the spread of this  work his power will be limited and he  will finally be bound.    Therefore as Saints we have a great  work resting upon us. We are called  to proclaim the gospel to the nations   and gather out the honest. The   Lord has promised to gather  out Zion and establish his people  though a woman might forget The  sucking child, He cannot forget Zi[on]    There has never been a dispensa-  tion of the gospel like the present   one. This is different from any that  has preceded it. It embraces all that  has been given in the past. The Lord  is blessing His Saints here with  wealth, but let them not foget  God. He has decreed that Zion shall  not be removed out of her place,  therefore if Zion commits sin she will  be chastized until she purifies herself.  Therefore serve the Lord, pay your  tithes, assist in building Temples, at-  tend your prayers and live your re-  ligion faithfully. 
 APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF.    I am pleased to meet with so many  of our young brethren this morning.   I read The Preceptor as soon as it  was out of the press. None of us  are so old that we cannot learn, and   I thought that if I had always ob-  served the teachings of that little   book I would probably have accom-  plished a great deal more good in the   course of my life than I have. When   I first embraced the gospel it seemed   to me that I could convert every-  body to it, so plain was it to my  mind. But I fould myself mistaken.   I never asked any kind of an office   in my life, but I did ask of the Lord  the privilege of preaching the gospel.  Not that I desired thereby to gain  the honor of men, nor because I  thought it an easy task, but there  was a Spirit in me that caused me to  desire to preach the truth. If we   ever attain to a celestial glory, to an  inheritance in the presence and king-  dom of God, we must obey the law  upon which that blessing is predi-  cated. We must keep the law of   God, or we are not qualified to preach   it. I am anxious for the welfare and  progress of the work of mutual im-  provement. It was instituted for   good and has already been the means  of accomplishing much good. But I  do not think it is yet thoroughtly or-  ganized and it is necessary to intro-  duce improvements in this respect.    A great diversity of opinion exists  among the Saints regarding a testi-  mony of the gospel. Some think that  in order to obtain a testimony, some   marvelous manifestation, as for ex-  ample, the visitation of an angel   is absolutely necessary. But  this idea is incorrect. When a   person has obeyed the gospel and  been baptized, and has received the  laying on of hands for the gift of the   Holy Ghost, it is the privilege of that   person to enjoy the whispering of  that Spirit, which speaks in a still  small voice, and it is the privilege of  that person to receive a testimony by  the inspiration of that Spirit. I have   had many marvelous manifestations  during my experience in this Church,  but I never had so conclusive a tes-  timony of the truth of this work as   the whisperings of that Spirit.    Well may Brother Thatcher say  that these associations are not estab-  lished to afford amusement to our   young people. They were not estab-  lished for any such a purpose. They   were designed to afford our young   people opportunities of gaining a  knowledge of the gospel, and to become  qualified to bear it to the human  family.    I have sometimes heard elders re-  mark that some other brother had  beat them in preaching; or say that   they were afraid that someone would  beat them in preaching. Such re-  marks always strike me very unfa-  vorably. I do not like to hear them.   I was never afraid that some one   else would beat me in preaching, or   obtain above me any honor in the   things of the Kingdom of God, for I  know that any desirable honor I ever  obtain must come from God. 
 APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF    When I look at the creations of God  I often marvel at the infinite variety  which I see therein. This eternal  variety was shown among the spirits  of men in the eternal world, and there  was a gradation of spirits before cre-  ation just the same as after the birth  of men. The Lord has said he would   take of the noble spirits and make  rulers in His kingdom. Very few  men in any age of the world since  the days of Adam, have been willing   to receive the word of the Lord and   work in harmony with Him. So it is  to-day. Out of 11,000,000,000 peo-  ple now on the earth only a few have  embraced the gospel. The feeling of  this generation is, "Give me gold and   silver; I do not want the salvation  you offer." You are forming your   characters. I am forming mine. If   I commit sin it must be paid for  somewhere, if not in time, then in  eternity. The secret acts and  thoughts and intents of men are to  be revealed by the angels of the Lord.  The angels that will reveal these   things are the servants and prophets   of the Lord who have held the keys   of various dispensations of the gos-  pel in the different thousand years,  since the creation, from the first to  the seventh.    Joseph Smith was a noble spirit in   the presence of God thousands of   years before he was born. The   Lord has chosen other spirits who  are now among the Latter-day Saints   who have hearts and souls that are   inclined to truth and righteousness.   The sisters have just as good a right  to smoke, chew, drink and get drunk  as the brethren have. But the sis-  ters never do these things. We will   all have to keep the word of wisdom  sooner or later. We are told by rev-  elation that all the intelligence and   truth we aquire during life will re-  main with us in the resurrection.    The world is against us. Our own   nation is seeking to oppress us, and   already a movement is afoot to in-  duce the next Congress to pass strin-  gent legislation to oppress us. It is  our duty to pray daily to the Lord  for His power to be exercised in our   behalf. I have faith in Zion. I saw  it when it was small, and I have seen   a little one became a thousand. I   have faith our young people. I  believe they will keep the Word of   Wisdom, and become a righteous na-  tion.    We are on the verge of great  changes. There will be changes in   Zion, in Jerusalem, in the United  States and in all nations of the  world. If our young men want to  know what events await this genera-  tion, let them read the revelation of  St. John. The Lord showed to him  many things that will come to pass   in this age of the world. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said it  was a correct doctrine that young men  should hold the priesthood when they  took the daughters of Zion to wife. It  was their duty also to qualify them-  selves to proclaim the gospel to the  world. Many had regretted their neg-  ligence in this matter at home, when   standing before assemblies of stran-  gers abroad. The youth of Zion will  have to bear off this kingdom in the  midst of the calamities and judgments   that will vex the world. When the  earth was fully ripe in wickedness they  would then be required to go forth and   bind up the law and seal the testimony  to the nations of the earth. The pre-  dictions of the servants of the Lord  would all be fulfilled, notwithstanding  the unbelief of this generation. The  prophecies of God's servants had been   literally fulfilled in the past in the raising   up of one nation and the overthrow  of others, and in the destruction   cities and kingdoms, and those yet to  be fulfilled would come to pass in the  same manner.    President Woodruff again referred to  the necessity of the young men prepar-  ing themselves for the work of the  ministry and narrated circumstances  that transpired during his labor in that   capacity. To this end it was not   necessary for a man to have a collegiate  education, but the Elders were to study  the principles of the Gospel, that at  the proper time the Holy Spirit might  select from the knowledge they had  stored up, such things as would do  good when spoken. In this respect the  Elders were totally unlike the priests  of the day. God always backed up the  testimonies of his servants. The field  was large and the laborers few and the   Lord wanted the young to qualify  themselves to gather out the wheat  from the tares. 
 American Fork, Utah, Jan. 27, [18]98.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother: I am pleased with the op-  portunity to preach the word of the Lord abroad.

Dear Sir:    Find enclosed a proof of the biographical sketch we propose to   use in the second (and last) volume of our Album of Prominent Bankers of Am-  erica. Have the kindness to read the matter over carefully and note any  corrections or changes which you think should be made. If the sketch as  it stands meets with your approval, mark it O K. In any event please re-  turn it to us as soon as possible.    As we intend to print only so many copies of the book as we can  be sure of selling, you are particularly requested to indicate whether you  will want more than one copy ofor yourself and one for the bank. To you,  as a contributer to the book's contents, the price will be ten dollars,   per copy, although the regular price is twenty-five dollars. Like the   first volume (copy of index enclosed) the book we now are compiling will con  tain about five hundred portraits with appropriate sketches; these will  occupy over five hundred quarto pages, with gilt edges, bound in seal-  skin, deeply embossed and lettered in gold. The artistic merit, and actu  al usefulness of the work for purposes of reference, identification, etc.,   will far exceed in value the amount we ask which, in fact, is just about   what the books will cost us. As your action in the matter is very impor-  tant to us, we hope to have a definite reply.    With good wishes, we are    Yours very truly,   The Financier Company.   J. E. Scattergood.

DAVID CAMERON, [Counselors.]    Notify both 3 Apl GSB    Panguitch, Utah, Feb 22nd 1897    Prest Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother:  We take pleasure in  recommending Elders John Houston and George  Dodds for missions to Scotland. Elder Houston has  filled a two years mission to the Southern States some  years ago. But as he is an unmarried man, he  feels like it would be a pleasure to labor in the missionary  field, and as his parents came from Glasgow Scotland  we think that is the place he should go so he coueld geth-  er genealogy. Elder Dodds is a native of Scoland and  he has expressed a desire to go on a visit to his native  land. We think they could be ready to leave Salt Lake  City by the 1st of April. Bro. Dodds is a married man  & about 53 ^years^ & Elder Houston is a bout 50 years of age    Your brethren  Jesse W. Crosby Jr.   Mahonri M. Steele    If they are not to old to take foreign missions, let  them go to Scotland or great Britain. J. F. S.

 Panguitch, Utah, April 26th. 1897.    President Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother,    Riley G. Clark Jr., of this place who is now a student   of the B. Y. Academy of Provo, informs his parents that he had  been called upon a mission to Europe. This call has been made  without any knowledge of the presidency of this Stake or of the  bishop of this ward. We had been called upon to furnish a certain  number of missionaries whiceh we have done and have a list of others  to chose from as they shall be wanted. The parents of Riley G.   Clark Jr. some months ago were approached in relation to their  son being called on a mission and they expressed a desire that he  be given a chance to finish his education and then they would  be more than willing that he should be called to perform a miss-  ion as he would then be better prepared and their request awas  considered by the local authorities here and garanted.    We have one missionary already in the field, William  King, who has been called from the academy without our consent  and we sdesire to know whether or not that is the order of the  church, if it is not we enter a protest against the Faculty of  the Academy saying who of our wards ans^d^ Stake shall be called  on missions.    An early reply will greatly oblige,  Your brother in the gospel,    Jesse W. Crosby Jr.    P.S. The parents of Riley G. Clark Jr. have notified him to report  at onece as ready for his mission.    J. W. C. Jr.

 Tooele City,  July 18, 1897.    Bro Wilford Woodruff:  Dear Brother:    I received  your welcome letter dated July 9th.  I was up north when the first letter   was sent me and I didn't get  home untill a week after it was  sent, that's the reason I did not  answear as promptly as I should  have done.

 Write as per.  memo.    No. 6 Floral Ave, between State and Second East Strs.  Salt Lake City, December 1, 1897    Prest. Woodruff and Counsellors.    Dear Brethren:    In answer to yours of  February 5th, 1896, instructing me to report to you  in one year my condition and prospects for filling  a mission to Scandinavia, I beg, respectfully, to report  as follows:    My condition now is no better than it was then,  if, indeed, it is not worse. I have been barely able to  make a living for myself and wife and about all I own  is my horse and wagon, which I use in my business of  hauling coal, etc. My health is not good, being subject  to painful attacks of rheumatism. My wife's health is   also bad and I fear she could not earn her living in  my absence.    Nevertheless, my heart is in the work, and if you  still see fit to send me forth to the missionary field,  I will make every effort that lies within my power
