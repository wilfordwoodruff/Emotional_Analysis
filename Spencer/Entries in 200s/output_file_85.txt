Richards, in order that he could learn from the Missionary elders to a certain extent the  labors performed by them, formed a report which he  desired each elder to fill out immediately after  the end of each month, there being some time  during the 24 hours of each day that I have not  been given account of and which I thout essential I have added more for the elders in my part to fill out.  There are some elders who put in very little time and having something of the nature diagramed for  the elders to report upon. The president is able  to suggest where he would otherwise be at a loss, at  times, to offer suggestions or give advise to the elders, and  they having a form to work to can understand to a certain  extent the labor required of them. Some will average 2 and 3 hours per day. while others, laboring under the same circumstan- ces average 6 and 8 hours and if we had no report given ENDENTRY of labors performed each month, many of the elders  would be robing the Lord and that possibly not knowingly.  The work of the Lord is prospering throughout the  Mission, although not many ^are^ added to the Faith yet. tThose who have joined are endeavoring to serve the Lord and  are being educated in the glorious Gospel.  We have two very interesting Sunday Schools which  are attended by Saints and outsiders. also two very  interesting M. I. A., and the saints are getting grounded  in the work of the Lord and it does my heart good  to hear them bear testimony to the devinity of the  work they have engaged themselves to.  Some of the elders do not seem to take the council  of the inspired Servants at home when setting them apart  to missions. and there will be something said and done  if they, the elders when they come on missions do not leave  the girls alone and cease making love to them, there are some  here, and where I have learned of the same, I have given them the  information that they were disobeying council. and I could not  and would not countenance their actions. The health of the  elders is generally good. With love and best wishes for you and yours, and  all the Saints. I am your brother in the Gospel Andrew Smith Jr. Pres.

Wilford Woodruff, and Councillors  My Beloved Brethren:  I think you would be pleased to learn from this part of  the Lords vinevard occassionally and therefore I  occupy myself at the present time, to inform  you of some of the good accomplished since  my last to you.  When elder Fred E. Barker arrived at  Sydney arrangments were made for him to go to  C. D. Fox who arrived with  him to labor as a traveling elder in Victoria. I decided to go to Brisbane with elder Barker  and during my stay there I was taken down with a fever known in these parts as the Dengue it  seems to be a complications of complaints in  the system, a number of the elders have also  been affected with the same.  The work of the Lord in that part, (Brisbane)  is moving along nicely, after witnessing the  ordinance of baptism performed, also assisted in  the confirmation. Organized a Relief Society with  officers and aids numbering ten in all. Ordained  one teacher, and two deaconcts, the M.I.A  being in a disorganized state for a short time was reorganized, and introduced some ideas (new  to the members) in the sunday school. a good spirit  ENDENTRY prevailed, and the saints were satisfied that the  Lord had a hand in all that had been done for  the progress of the work in that part.  Elder Wm Armstrong was honorably released from presiding in the Queensland Conference, granted the  opportunity of Laboring among his many relatives  in Fred E. Barker was appointed to preside  in elder Armstrongs stead.  Several elders have been sent out to labor  where opportunity has been better given to spread  the work and warn the people.  Instructions have been given and arrangments  are made to hold conferences ^tomorrow 10th^ at Brisbane, and Launceston, and a good time is anticipated  I received the letter from Geo Reynolds, inform- ing me of the arrangments between you and the C.P. S.S. Agent, will no doubt learn of the instructions  to their agents in Sydney the 12th inst. would have  been able to tell you of the perfected arrangments  at this writing if there was not so many holly-days here at the present time, no business being done  from good Friday until after Easter Monday.  I will acknowledge the receipt of the letter  from Bro Reynolds to me.  With love and best wishes for  you in ^the^ multitudinous duties you are called to  perform, I remain a weak instrument in the  work of the Lord.

Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith,  Salt Lake, Utah.  Beloved Brethren:  Your letter of March 8th, apprising  Andrew Smith, Jr., from the position of President of the Australian Mission and appoint- ing me to that position, came to hand to-day.  While feeling keenly the sense of my weakness and un- worthiness thus to be honored with this important and very responsible station, I feel very thankful to receive in con- nection therewith your prayers and blessing, which I prize above all things of the earth.  I have felt the blessings of God so far with me in this mission, and I am now constrained to say that with the same continued upon me (which I shall claim, and believe I shall have, in redoubled measure) I will do my best in every way to merit the confidence reposed in me by you and to further the interests of this mission, so far as may lie in my power.  I was about a month ago installed here in the po- sition of  Pres't of the Queensland conference, taking the place of Bro. Sydney among his relatives ENDENTRY There is a branch here of abt. 70 souls, and the care of  this with its various organizations (R.S., S.S., M.I.A., Priesthood meetings, etc.) makes a field for considerable labor, vigilence and activity on the part of the president of the conference stationed here. I am glad, however, to have had the experience afforded me therein, as well as that gained by laboring among strangers, wherein I have tried to be fully active.  Some changes have been made, two Elders have been appoint- ed to a new, and, we believe promising, field, and we confidently expect some fruit of our labors in the near  future. This mission now presents an apparently  barren field, however, there being so much indifference to religion in general and so rarely sufficnt virtue and zeal to impel the people to even attempt to live a religion requiring what the Gospel does.  It is my belief that later on we shall reap some fruit in this land, though at present it looks discourag- ing. In some cases Elders have lived in and tracted a neigh- borhood for many months without seeing much good result, fur- ther than making some kind friends.  There are a few good people now investigating, who, I be- lieve will yet yield obedience to the Gospel message.  Your ob't servant and brother in the Gospel,  F. E. Barker.  Future Add. Newtown P.O.

AUSTRALIA.  52 Burren Street, Erskineville, Sydney, May 22, 1898.  Prests. Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon,  and Joseph F. Smith,  Salt Lake, Utah.  Dear Brethren:  There are now 22 Elders laboring in  this mission, two of whom are released to return home next month, (June 1898).  In case others are released after being 2 1/2 years in the field (as has heretofore been the rule of practice) there will be two more to be released before Oct. next, and three during that month, thus reducing the number from  22 to 15, not counting any hereafter to arrive. Elders Jno. B. Mathias arrived on the 10th inst., and have gone to their fields of labor.  We shall be under some difficulties at once to prosecute the work now under way, and could easily use double the force now in the field. There are numbers of places where I believe openings could be made to some advantage, as where we already have one or  more members or friends. Elders who could speak German would be specially valuable in some parts.  There have been four baptisms within the past month.  Your Brother in the Truth, F. E. Barker.  Let us send from two to three  each each month until he shall be supplied—at least with from six to 12 Elders—one or two good German speakers J. F. S ENDENTRY F. E.

Kimball at length in great plainness upon various subjects; he has been clothed with the Spirit and power of God, so that he has freely satisfied  his mind upon any subject, not regarding any false traditions, we or our fathers may have imbibed, and the people are edified and benefitted by what they hear, the ward school houses are all crowded to excess during the evening meeting. Brother F. D. Richards and myself being the only ones of the Twelve in the city, we organized the missionaries  with the assistance of Prest. Young to preach throughout this city, all the wards during Winter have met in the school houses several evenings in the week, to hear the word of the Lord. We have attended a meeting of some kind about every evening for the last 3 months, we meet with the Seventies, High Priests, Bishops, and ward meetings weekly, our preaching is mostly confined to reformation, repentance, confession and forsaking of sin, baptism for the remission of sins, living our religion, magnifying the Priesthood, prizing the blessings which God has given us, paying our Tithing, seeking first the kingdom of God and building it up, and mani- festing our faith by our works and trusting in the Lord for our blessings. Elders L. Snow were with us during the setting of the Legislature and they have joined us in our missionary labors and  the Spirit and power of God has rested upon us in our labors. Elder Hyde has gone South on a mission and the people almost in mass are rising up in the city, and in the country and are engaging in the Reform- ation, confessing their sins and restoring what they have done wrong. Meetings are crowded, confidence is being restored and a more healthy atmosphere is sencirly felt, and strong determinations are expressed by the brethren and  live their religion, practice virtue and righteousness, and put down vice and iniquity in all the forms.  ENDENTRY We would like to have some of our Eastern friends forward us a few of the tubers of the chinese Potatoe as advertized by Wm. R. Prince and Company. as we would like to make a trial of it in this Territory, we would also wish our friends who are emigrating to this Territory to still bear in mind, the propriety of bringing with them or forwarding as they may have opportunity any choice fruit seeds, cuttings, roots andc. that will be a benefit to the Territory. We would like to obtain some of Hoveys seedling strawberries or any other good kinds Lawton's Huckberry, Calamba and Isabella Grapes, Indigo or madder or cotton seeds, and seed from the chinese sugar cane or Millet. Hon. J. M. Bernhisel has blessed us from time to time with seeds and grain from the Patent office, some of which I think will prove quite a benefit to us for which we feel to return him our thanks.  The Reformation is progressing thoughout this city and Territory with great interest. President Young has given much valuable information and teaching to the Quorums and people, although he has not been able to attend the meeting at the J. M. Grant on the 4th. Decem. Ulto. until last Sunday the 1st inst. He with his counsellors D. H. Wells all appeared in the stand, the Tabernacle was crowded to overflowing as has been the case nearly all Winter and hundreds have to leave who cannot get into the house, the appearance of Prest. Young in the Tabernacle after an absence of two months created a sensation throughout the vast assembly, he addressed the people for about one hour and a half, his discourse was very interesting and edifying to the people, he was clothed with the spirit and power of God and the hearts of the people were open to receive his words which were quick and powerful. He was followed by Presidents Kimball and Wells, all of the discourses will appear in the News. President Kimball has spoken to the people for several Sabbaths previous upon several subjects in great plainness presenting  ENDENTRY Bro.

Elder Dennis E. Harris,  Dear Bro.  The health of Brother Wm M. Palmer, who has been presiding over the North Western Mission, is such that we consider it improdent for him to continue his services in the missionary field at the present time, espe- cially during the cold weather of winter.  His lungs are very feeble, and have been much  impaired by his continuous speaking.  We would like him to have a respite from the labor of preaching, and therefore, in consul- tation with him, have concluded to appoint you as President for the time being in the North Western Mission.  We have requested Bro. Palmer to continue his oversight of the mission. We know that his heart is in the work, and that he is familiar with that field; therefore, we shall depend upon suggestions from him from time to ENDENTRY 2 time.  Whatever information you have to communicate, however, concerning the affairs of the mission, we trust you will send it to my Office, so that we may have it there to refer to in case we should think it necessary.  In appointing you to this labor, we beseech God, our Eternal Father, to abundantly qualify you, for the great responsibility which rests upon you, to endow you with every gift and grace,  and to make you equal to every labor and emergency. If you seek the spirit of revelation,  you will receive all that is necessary to enable you to counsel the Elders, over whom you are called to preside, in regard to their labors, and that which is best to do to make them successful and also concerning the organization of Branches,  Conferences, and opening new fields, and everything necessary to enable you and your fellow laborers to thoroughly warn the people throughout the states where you are called to labor.

Palmer,  Dear Brother:  In relieving you from the responsibility of the  Presidency of the Northern States Mission, or, as it was formerly called, the North  Western States Mission, we feel that it is but justice to you to express our  feelings concerning the labors which you have performed while acting in that  capacity. Your services have been most satisfactory, and the only fault that we  have felt to find with you, if we were to attempt to find any, has been that you  have not been sufficiently careful of your own health and have exerted yourself  to an extent that we feared might undermine your constitution. You have been  exceedingly diligent in the performance of your labors, and the work has prospered  under your presidency. We have regretted that your health and other circumstances  have been such as to compel us to release you.  No doubt, the remembrance of your labors will live  in the memories of the Elders who have been associated with you, and also in the  memories of the Elders who have been associated with you, and also in the memories of the souls who, through your instrumentality as a servant of God, have  been brought to the knowledge of the truth.  ENDENTRY We ask God the Eternal Father to bless you in all your  labors, to give you strength and grace to endure every trial, and to enable you  to maintain your integrity even unto the end, that you may be crowned, with the souls  that you have helped to save, in the celestial kingdom of our God.

Dear Brother:  Your letter of the 27th ulto upon the subject of appointing an Elder to preside pro. tem. in the North Western Mission, has been received. We do not think it proper to request you in your present condition of health to go out to the mission and remain there, as you propose to do, if we say so. Your health is of value to yourself, to your family, and to the cause, and we think you should take care of yourself and endeavor to recover from the attack from which you have ENDENTRY have suffered. Your lungs require rest, and you had better, during the winter season especially, be very careful about speaking in public, and if you do speak at all not to speak long at a time. We are well satisfied with your labors in your mission, and hope that your usefulness will not be impaired by any imprudence on your part in taking care of yourself. It would be gratifying to us to learn that you have completely recovered the strength of your voice and lungs. In the meantime we think it would be very proper for Bro. Dennis E. Harris to act as President of the North Western Mission for the time being.  We nominate him upon your recommendation and trust that he will fill the position in a manner to bring glory to the Lord's cause and salvation to the people.

I desire President Woodruff and his associates to know that I  cordially appreciate what they did in this matter in anticipating the  payment of their notes. I know of no others who in these contracting  financial times have been kind enough to anticipate their own paper. As  I said in my other letter, their action in this matter has greatly im- proved their credit in New York City. I could see it immediately at  the Plaza Bank, and Mr. Mills, the President, has spoken of it several  times to other bankers, and all of tyhem have said that they knew of no  other people or corporation who in these times, when money has become  the only thing of value, have anticipated the payment of their paper.  I  have given the impression that these notes were redeemed at $22,000, and  it is better to let that impression remain—better for my credit, and  better for theirs. I wish you to assure Presidents Woodruff, Conrad  and Smith of my appreciation in this matter, and of my unrelinquished  desire to be of service to them and their people in any way that I can  in the future, personally, socially, politically, or in any other manner  in which my influence or help might be of any avail to them. I have  great faith in the problem they are working out. I have had constant  admiration for the manner in which your people have reclaimed the desert  and set up a great state in the wilderness, and as great admiration of  the humanity and kindness constantly displayed in your religion. Espec- ially pleasing to me is that portionof your church work and intention  which seeks to care for your people in this world as well as the next.  The industry uyou inculcate, the honesty you teach, the law and order you  observe, the ambition you have to serve your fellow men, are all very  appealing and influential with me, and the time will never come when I  will not be glad to serve your people or your Church in any way in which  my influence may fall to their benefit.

Woodruff, My dear Brother Wilford:  I am glad to hear of your  good health.  I am informed that you con- tinue to improve.  This is very gratifying news. I read your discourse, delivered on Sunday  with the utmost pleasure.  I am sure it will  be greatly appreciated by the Saints, as it is  a powrful testimony, and especially so coming  from you under the circumstances.  The Lord  be praised for giving you the strength and  Spirit which you had.  My regret is that I  was not with you; but you had, and always  have, my faith and prayers.  I thank the Lord  that I live when you do, and that I have been,  and am, so closely associated with you.  It is  one of the great joys of my life to be your fellow- apostle and one of your counselors.  I feel the  Lord has been very kind to me in granting me this  happiness, and I trust I shall never prove unworthy of  it.  My hoarseness still continues; but I  think my health has improved.  I hope to be back by  the morning of the 9th at the latest.  Accept my love, my dear President, and give it to Bro. Joseph F.  I am Your loving Brother, Geo. Q. Cannon ENDENTRY W. DERBY JOHNSON, JR.^George Teasdale,^ COLONIA DIAZ,  CANTON GALEANA, CHIHUAHUA, - MEXICO.  Personal  Colonia Diaz, July 5th 1891  Dear President Woodruff:  There being no Sabbath school this  morning I sit down to have another quiet chat with you. Our  circumstances are more comfortable than they have been. We lived  in a room 11x14 for some time. Then we bought the house consisting of two  rooms. The other room was 14x15 ft 6 in. When we obtained these two rooms  we felt we could breathe more freely. But when the summer came and we were cooking in this larger room, it was so hot that we  were being cooked with our food. The advent of Tilley and her  boys necessitated more room. Se we built a kitchen and bedroom on to our house of two rooms and now we are very comfortable But building in Mexico is an expensive luxury if one has the common necessities to produce light and air. In the Mex- ican houses they have adobie walls, mud roof, doors and   window shutters. Very little if any glass. I think I have  discovered why. Three windows cost in Deming $4.25 four dollars and twenty five cents. They weighed (58) fiftyeight pounds. The cost  for duties was $7.90 freight 58¢ Papers 80¢ total $9.28. A suit  of furniture Bed stead ^and wire mattrass^ Bureau, wash stand, 9 chairs and a childs chaircast $44.25 The duties were $227.2065. Freight $3.95 Papers and stamps $300 = Total $34.50 The first cost is in U. S. Currency. The second in Mexican Silver, which would  make the windows and furniture rather costly and necessitate  sustaining home manufacture. Building is expensive. Lum- ber is selling at Diaz $42.50 per (1000) thousand feet Mexican silver. ENDENTRY Etty and the children have gone to Juarez on a visit. Jenny  and Georgey were recovering from the whooping cough and I  thought a change of air would help them as they had run  down considerable. We are having quite a warm time. The  sun shines nearly all the time and the heat is very  oppressive. Yesterday was the 4th of July. We had no public  demonstration. We have only a few men at home. So many  on the railway and away freighting. Those who have  stayed at home are doing well. Their crops look well  and their trees growing. I think in the outcome those who  stay at home will be the gainers. We ^have^ had new potatoes  corn, beans, and peas already. Meat is scarce, although we  have some stock men who seem to think they are rich in cattle, but that is all. Very seldom kill any. Not  that we need meat. If we had it we would have to cook  and eat it or it would soon spoil. Our Fast Meeting was  well attended. It is almost like Sunday on Fast Day. In  the afternoon the Sisters of the Relief Society meet, and  we have a good Relief Society, some of the brethren generally  meet with them. In the evening we have a conjoint meet- ing of the Young Mens and Womens Mutual Improvement Association All meetings well attended and very interesting. The  Saints feel well and we take our schooling and exper- ience as well as we can. We have some disagreeble things to meet sometimes, and some get discouraged and  leave us. They do not give the Mexican Mission a very  flattering report. But those who stay seem contented  and happy. They trust in the Lord and seek His counsel. This class are contented to remain. The health of the colo- ny is improving. We hope soon to resume our Sabbath  schools and Primaries. It is wonderful of so many sick how few  comparatively speaking have died. I have had good help in our  ENDENTRY Marshall Gleason came from Utah and  picked up Allsworth at Deming. I made  inquiries about him when I went to Doublan  where he lived and found the Presiding Elder  Bro. Jones knoew all about them. They were not  colonists ^n^or received as members of that branch. Monday, July 6th 1891 Last night we held a Priesthood  meeting and it was determined D.V. to resume our  Sabbath Schools next Sabbath. Health of the Colony improving. I anticipate going shortly to make  another visit to the settlements and organizing  at ward at Doublan. They are suffering for  want of an organization. Things generally are  improving. We have no trouble. The worst man  represented here by reports—Bro W. W. Galbraith said to me not very long ago—"President  Teasdale, anything I have, you want, if you  will only let me know, I shall be pleased  to let you have it"—from what I heard of  Bro Galbraith, I would naturally expect to  have had some trouble with him, but he  and his family have treated me with kindness  and respect. Instead of pushing him off or  treating him with coldness and contempt, I have quietly labored  with him and preached the gospel. You thought he might  be made a useful member of the community and  you were right in your impression. We all have our  peculiar individuality and the Lord has brought  us into His fold, peculiar though we may be, and gen- erally, the worst of us, can be handled with kindness  and consideration, can't we?

Johnson. We have been together  administring to the sick andc. He is a spiritually  minded man and has the spirit of his call- ing.

We could take care of you and Aunt Emma if she was with you and you could  have a rest here. The road between here and  Deming is not so bad. You would only  need to be out one night and then you could  sleep in a tent. The best rig in the place  would be at your service and willing  hands to take the best of care of you. And  how the children and young people would  delight to see and hear you. If you did  not like to travel in the heat of the day you  could choose a bright moonlight, as we  do sometimes and travel in the cool of  the evening and early morning and  take a nap in the day time a'la Mexican for that is the way they travel. We shall soon  have what they call the rainy season, which  generally follows this severe heat.

If however you can  get some more pork from him this fall you will oblige me by doing so, for this  is a separate affair, and he still owes  me considerable pork.

Agreeable to your request I made arrangements for Bros. Tooele Con- ference, and I went to Ogden and attended the young peoples Conference. There was a large attendance, the house being completely filled. We had a very interesting time so far as the meetings were concerned. The morning was occupied by reports and short lectures from various young men, on the subjects of the "Organiza- tion of the Church," "The Miracles of Jesus," "The Constitu- tion of the U. S." and the "Divine origin of the Book of Morm- on." The afternoon was occupied by administering the Sacrement, sustaining the authorities of the Associ ations, and a discourse by myself. So far so good, and I think you will accord with me in this, but now comes the subject which is the cause ENDENTRY upside-down text See "Suggestions of the Apostles." andc. Contributor, of May 1880—page 191. end of upside-down text  of this writing. In your letter of instructions you say, "I think it desirable if you could consult with the Presidency of  the Stake and appoint a good man, one that would meet with the approval of the Societies and be sustained by them to fill the position" vacated by Jos. A. West. Agreeable to this instruction I "consulted with the Presidency," and to my surprise and disappointment I found they were not united and had never consulted together on this subject. The counsellors claimed that they had been ignored and slighted and the feeling ran high, and extended back to times past and other things. I found it impossible to reconcile them or to come to any agreement in the time which we had, and the only thing I could do was to propose a postponement of the consideration of the subject until some future time. Bro. Peery was eager for me to make the nomination myself and put it through. This I considered unreasonable and unfair besides being entirely opposed to the written instructions on this point, so I ref- used to do it. And told him I did not propose to carry his burdens for him. The instructions upon this matter, so far as I can recall them to memory ^is^ for the "Presidency of the Stake to appoint the Stake Presidents of the Associations subject to the approval of the High Council." ^andc.^ This had not been done I therefore declined to do anything in the premises, and ad- vised the Presidency to go to work and carry out this rule.

I have felt vary anxious to hear from you since we have been here but have not as yet herd a word from you or about you since we left New York and at that time you was in sumthing of an unsettled state in your temporal affairs, I suppose you would like to know sumthing what I am doing in this Land. I will therefore say that I have had more business on hand since my arival here than at any one time During life I found the Saints needed in much council and many after alterations through various portions of the British dominions. I have taken a tour through England since I came I have held many conferences since I came we held our general conference at Manchester on 6th April it lasted three and a half days and more business done than ever before in any one conference in England their was represented on that occasion ten thousand saints save 90, in England, Scotland, Wales and incliding their families would probably amount to 30,000 souls  We had a large congregation to leav these chirches represe- nted, and illegible the business of leaving the churches represented, and appointing the Elders to take charge of them and attending to the business that necessarily has to be done at such conferences  We established a joint stock company for the purpose of Establishing manufactories in Nauvoo the whole stock ENDENTRY is divided into sixty thousand stores making a Capitol of one hundred and fifty thousand Dollars the way the stores are now selling it will be but a little time before the Stock will be taken up. This will be a great help in building up Nauvoo in esstablishing business in cotton and wool and iron trade and employing the poor in that place, we had done this in order to concentrate the wealth through and union of the Saints in this land with the Saints in America, save one taking as high as 100 Stores, I have just received letters and papers from Nauvoo all bearing good News they have commanced building the dam on the Mississippi River I am con? on the Emigration Business, printing, Temple Tything, and Having the presidency of the ten thousand Saints gives me a plenty of suply  I am now providing 3000 Doctrine and Covenenants which will readily sell as soon as out of press as their is great call for them in this land, we shall emigrate the families via Boston During the summer months I have not yet received any letters from Br Webster nor heard from him ownly as I see his name in the Neighbor as a letter from Father Carter a few days since who informed me that they were all ^well^ that Sister Foss family who were so very sick when we were there had all got well again, and our little Phebe was very well, I was glad to hear from them. My health is very good, which is the case with our home though I have heard some time I came I have had one journey through Scotland and I intend to visit France soon, But among the Signs of the times a dark war cloud is appearing over England and America there has never appeared as great a project for it is believed the two countries since peace was proclaimed as at the present time. Sir Robert Peel has taken a strong stance against Mr.  Oregon question. Either Sir Robert Peel or Mr. Polk must recall what they have said or at least not attempt to carry their missions into operation if no ENDENTRY their will assuredly be war, and knowing the minds of both governments I do not believe they will either of them yield the point, great excitement prevails here upon the subject. England is making great preparation for it 16,000 troops have been ordered to embark for Canida. As I was coming home from the office to day I saw hand Bills through the street headed in large letters War War with America the last steem ship was Delaid by parliment to take a messenger from Washington. I expect it will be decided I expect in a short time, if war is proclaimed I shall probably leave for America. I believe the day is not far Distant when the American people will have sumthing to do besides fighting the Latter Day Saints I believe the Nation is rife for judgment and a Scourge awaits her.

As to myself I all still a illegible as it were in Mormonism for it is my life meet and drink and I do not expect to be any thing els but a Mormon either in life or Death. I have never felt as great a responsibility resting upon me as at the present time and when I consider it it certainly looks like a marvelous work and a wonder that an obscure unlearned Miller should stand in England at the head of ten thousand saints, chartering Ships to gather them to this land of Zion establishing printing presses forming a company with a capitol of $150,000, dollars to build up Nauvoo I truly feel the saying a prophet is not without honor save his own country but it is of the Lord and not of man and to him be the glory.

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF ZION'S CO-OPERATIVE MERCANTILE INSTITUTION:  The increase of trade and demand made upon the Institution by some of its best customers for accommodation, convinces us that our capital of $1,000,000 is inadequate to transact the large business of almost $4,000,000 per annum that the Institution is now doing; particularly when it is remembered that upon some lines of goods we have to give four months' time after the goods have  arrived here and been sold.  At a meeting of the Board of Directors held on the 15th of  February, the subject of increasing the Capital Stock was referred to a special committee who have reported, recommending that the Capital be increased 2,500 shares, and that $135 per share be charged for this increase, $100 of which will be credited to Cap- ital Stock account, and the remaining $35 to Reserve Fund, so as  to place the new stock exactly on a par with the old, so far as reserves are concerned.  In our showing just made of the assets and liabilities of the Institution, it will be seen that we have a Reserve Fund of  $350,000, to say nothing of the extremely low valuation placed upon real estate and buildings and on our stock of merchandise; so I have no hesitation in saying that at $135 per share, it is under rather than over the actual value of the Stock. Our showing for the past year is a good one, as good as any we have heretofore  made, and we have every reason to believe that we shall continue to do a large and prosperous business, and I see no cause why we should not be able to pay as good dividends as we have heretofore done, after this increase has been added to the Capital Stock. It is proposed to allot this Capital Stock pro rata to our present stockholders in the proportion of 25 per cent of their present holdings, but no subscription will be received for fractional parts of a share, excepting from such as now own a fraction and desire to make up a full share.  A circular has been prepared, which I have pleasure in enclosing with this, upon which stockholders will kindly notify the Secretary of the Institution whether they wish to subscribe and take ths additional stock or otherwise. It is important that the matter should be attended to by the stockholders as early as possible and the notification returned without delay. The new Stock must be paid for to the Treasurer of the Institution, one- half on or before May 1st, and the balance on or before Aug. 1st, 1891.  Respectfully,  Wilford Woodruff President.

Steele and Couselors, Presidency Bingham Stake. of Zion,  Dear Brethren:  Since the visit of Bro. Steele to this city we have  further considered the question of laocation of headquarters of your  stake, and have fully concluded, after conferring with Elder John Henry  Smith who figured prominently in its organization, that Iona is in  every way and the most proper as well as perhaps the most suitable place for  headquarters, it not only being the residence of the stake presidency,  but is also quite centrally located. We therefore recommend that the  people one and all regard Iona as headquarters of your stake.  As a stake organization you are starting out with the very  best of prospects. You have a remarkably good country, both healthful  and fruitful, with an abundant supply of water and singularly well  adapted to stockraising as well as agriculture. With industry, so char- acteristic of our people, coupled with intelligent management, and  accompanied by the blessing of God, prosperity must necessarily attend  your labors. We look for and expect prosperity to come to Zion in  fulfillment of the promises of the Lord; but we are not unmindful of the  fact that with prosperity come temptations, and too often evilas, which  render the latter state of a people worse than the first. As we have  learned to rejoice and acknowledge the hand of the Lord in the days of  our poverty we certaihnly should be able to acknowledge his hand in times  of prosperity; but this we can only do by being prepared to successfully  meet any new conditions which a favorable change in our temporal ENDENTRY with all Church business as far as they have the power  again I do not see how any Latter Day Saint can vote  or hold office under that Law it throws off our  property vote then lends to tax as High as they please  with no one to say why do you so however I hope  for the best and trust in God but it looks to me  as though it were going to work Great Hardships to  the Saints I was afraid that we were going to loose  Sister Cottam but I am thankful to say she  has revived and is getting Better but Brother Cottam  is getting worse He has 2 fits in 3 days, was overcome overcome in her sickness and it came near mak- ing letter Thompson sick as the Heft of the Brethren came upon her Brother Thompson sent his Horse  on a 4 days Journey to get another I expect to returne to  the templ tomorow or as soon as his horse comes  and stopt there untill the xxx is done then I shall  returne to my abode I was in Arizona a few  days since within 3 Miles of the spring.

As leaders among the people, these  two thoughts should be uppermost in your minds: The salvation of souls,  and the building up of Zion. If you yourselves have these desires  burining within you, you will be able to imbue your bishops and ^their^ coun- selors with the same feelings; and if you as a body of presiding priest- hood are united in your labors to this end you will have the power to  draw the people to you and guide them in the paths of righteousness; and  the evil one, who is ever on the alert to make inroads among the saints,  will not have power to divide or make headway against you. Without  being rigid or arbitrary you should make it a point to maintain, through  the co-operation of the general priesthood, as well as that of your  presiding officers, the discipline of the church, as this is the means  by which the saints are preserved from the wiles of the adversary. YThe  morals of the people should be jealously guarded, and the name of God  should not be used in vain. These two things we would especially have  you impress upon your young men. And if, in the course of events, fdiffi- culties arise among brethren, we hope they will make it a point to  settle the same in an amicable way without resorting to tribunals either  of the Church or State; and if possible to not let the sun go down  upon their wrath.  Living, as many of the brethren do live, upon their farms  at long distances from each other and from houses of public worship, they  are necessarily deprived more or less of that education which is derived  from association afforded by settlement and town life. We trust that  the brethren so situated will, with their families, not fall into the  habit of working on Sundays; but that they will keep holy the Sabbath  day as we are commanded to do, and make it a point to attend meetings  and Sunday school.  It is very important that your ward records be well kept, and ENDENTRY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Utah, August 3, 1888.  Elder John Steele, Toquerville.  Dear Brother:  Your very interesting favor of the 30th. of July has been received and read with great pleasure.  Yours has been indeed a pioneer and a busy life, and you are in a position now to give much valuable counsel to the rising generation, and to describe to them the hardships and privations and the shifts which the settlers of this country had to contend with and to resort to in the beginning. A new generation is now upon the scene, and though they hear occasionally con- cerning the work of the pioneers and the difficulties they had to contend with, still, in this city particularly, their ideas are exceedingly vague respecting these matters, and the men and women who can give them information from their personal experiences are fast passing away. There are really but few left.  I am glad that you have mentioned the birth of your  daughter; for there is another claimant for the honor of being the first white child born in the Valley after the arrival of the Pioneers. As I now remember ENDENTRY the date of his birth as it was announced, daughter was born before he was. I think I shall have your letter published in the Deseret News, as it contains a number of interesting items that are worthy of preservation.  I am glad to hear from you that you are enjoying your- self so well, and that your heart still beats with the love of Zion and the desire to see the Kingdom of God more widely spread and established. That you may live very many years yet to see the fruits of your labors and the increase of righteousness in the earth, is my earnest desire.  With kind regards, I am, Your Brother,  Wilford Woodruff ENDENTRY that proper care be taken of them as they become filled up, for future  generations will highly prize and make good use of them.  In the erection of public buildings the greatest wisdom should  be exercised. They are public property and should, therefore, reflect  the general intelligence and tatste of the people, and we hope that due  regard will be shown in the beauty of their design, ventilation, andc., by  obtaining the best available architectural ability in the preparation  of the plans. And we may add in this connection, that whatever you may  undertake in the way of erecting public buildings, invlolving a consider- able expenditure of means, should be done as much as possible within  your own resources, and not with the expectation that the Church may be  relied upon to make up deficiencies. Some of our stake and ward  officers have of late found themselves in the exceedingly unpleasant  position of being totally unable to meet public obligations contracted  by them without our knowledge or consent, ^and for the payment of which they themselves were held individually ^responsible;^^ and they have appealed to us  to help them to preserve their credit and maintain their financial honor,  while at the same time we were over-burdened ourselves. We have felt  that if brethren look to us for help for such purposes, they should  consult us before they involve themselves, and thus afford us an oppor- tunity of conferring with them as to the advisbability of such undertak- ings; otherwise they should depend wholly on their own resources. In  most of the stakes there is what is called a stake meeting house, a  building erected by the stake as a whole, which answers a good and  worthy purpose in the rich and populous stakes; but in newly organized  and sparsely settled stakes such a large central building it would not  be advisable to undertake to erect. We advise rather the erection of  commodious ward meeting houses and good boweries, so that stake con- ferences acan be taken to the people, so to speak; that is, they can be  held in the wards with bowery accommodations in the summer season, and ENDENTRY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS,  P. O. BOX B.  Salt Lake City, U. T. May 9th, 1889.  Elder John Steele,  Toquerville.  Dear Brother: Your letter of May 5th has been received, in which you  set forth the expressed wishes of your sister, made before her death and after your  explaining to her the true order of marriage and of adoption of her children, to be  sealed to you for eternity, instead of to her husband; and if that was not ad- missible, that she be sealed to your son, M. M. Steele. You also rsay "I told her I  did not know how that would be; such things had been done, but I did not know how  it would be again."  Of course, I am not econversant with what information you may have on  this subject; but I am not aware of any such sealings or adoptions in this Church.  I do not consider it proper for any such sealings or adoptions to be administered in  the Temples of the Lord. It is not any more proper for your sister to be sealed to  you as her husband, now that she is dead, than it would be if she were alive;  neither should she be sealed to your son, because such a marriage is too near of  ENDENTRY kin.  If your sister, while alive, did not feel that she wished to be sealed  to her living husband for eternity, and if she did not express any preference on  that matter other than the ones you mention, you should then make a choice in her  behalf, and have her sealed to some faithful man in the Church, either living or  dead, and have her children adopted into his family.  Trusting this will be satisfactory to you,  I remain your brother,  W Woodruff ENDENTRY the ward meeting houses in the cold weather. We believe, too, the  results will be altogether better by distributing the conferences in  this way than by holding them all the time at one place; and, besides,  the investment involved in one large central building would be spared to  you.  Before closing our communication we feel to add a few words  in regard to politics. You are doubtless already aware of the counsel  given to the presiding priesthood at the meeting held in October 1893  on this subject, and therefore all that we now need to say is that the  time which has expired since then has only gone to prove the wisdom of  the policy adopted by us on that occasion. It is true that some of our  brethren from a restless desire to do something for their party have  failed to strictly carry out the counsel given at the meeting referred  to; but it is a noteworthy fact that wherever this has been the case  the results have been anything but satisfactory. We mention this for  the purpose of reminding you that as a stake presidency or as individuals  you have no place whatever in the field of active politics unless there  be good and sufficient reasons to the contrary. In starting out in the  labors of your official career it is of the utmost importance that you  maintain the dignity of your high calling, and that your minds be free  from bias of every description; and this we are sure will be the case inasmuch as you seek earnestly to the Lord to know and carry out his  will. In this connection it may be interesting to quote to you one of  the significant sayings of the Prophet Joseph. There are three agents,  he taught us, at work on the earth—the Spirit of God, the spirit of  man, and the spirit of the Evil One. Brethren in the days of the  Prophet were deceived, and brethren all along the line since his day  have been deceived, and doubtless brethren will yet be deceived as  between the Spirit of God and the spirit of man, simply because they  have sought to carry out their own will and way, and to minister to ENDENTRY their own personal ambitions and selfish desires rather than to be  servants of God and shpepherds of his sheep. As long as you labor  unselfishly for Zion, for the blessing and uplifting of the people whom  God has called you to preside over, you will be entitled to His Spirit  to inspire and guide you in all your labors, and you will never be  found at a loss to distinguish between that Spirit which emanates from  God, and that spirit whixch has its source in man. We feel to say this to  you for the reason that whatever influence and power you may possess as  a presidency or as individuals are given to you of the Lord; and as God  our Father is a jealous God, so it becomes us his servants, in whiom he ha^s^  reposed a great and important trust, to be jealous also, that is, jealous  that all the power which comes from him to us, and through us to our  fellow servants, is used to his honor and to his glory, for the  building up of Zion, and the slalvation of our brethren and sisters.  Whenever you or either of you, come to the city we shall  be pleased to see you, and shall be glad to hear from you at any time on  any and all important mantters pertaining to the government of your stake.   Praying the Lord to give you every needed blessing, we are, with kind  regards,  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q.

Woodruff  We take the Earliest opportunity to  address a few lines to you, to make you acquainted with  the proceedings of the Legislators of the State of Illinois. Since they assembled in council in the City of  Springfield, there has been no business of any  importance transacted for the benefit and welfare  of the citizens of said State, but on the other hand  they have been continually debating and discussing  upon the Charter of the City of Nauvoo, and  the latest intelligence which we have received from  Springfield is that they have repealed the City Charter  also, the Legion Charter, but you know, we care  nothing about it for them that would kill the  prophets, would also take away our charter, but  they are only filling the cup of their damnation the more  which will send them to Hell, and that seems to be  the place for them any how, for their works do prove it to a demonstration, they have passed judgment  upon an innocent people as a community, but glory to  God the day is not far distant when they shall be  caught in a straight, and the measure which they meted  to us shall be meted to them two fold and running over.  We shall appeal right off and continue  to do so, until it goes to the Federal court of the  United States, and if it so be that it should also  pass there, we hope and trust by that time we  shall have accomplished all that the God of  ENDENTRY heaven designs for this place, and we ask no favors  of them, for they are poor miserable creatures at the  best.

I do not hear a word from Huner or any of his friends, not one cent of the money you sent last year by him has been forwarded I think that under the circumstance you was very successful indeed in securing that and in my opinion it was the best and only course to take with him to save it, to drive him right into it, after the principle is paid should he not pay the interest? I had no confidence in his former statements to you and I suppose he would liked to have put you off until he could have got away. I really desire to feel thankful that it is in so good  a shape. As you remark about business, we hardly know what a day may bring forth. I feel that it is very true matters are very fluc tuating here.

Upon the recept. if your letter informing  me of Mr Horners comeing to the States I wrote  him and the other man at once directing  them how to forward the funds, as yet I  have not heard a word from one of them.

MESSRS. TAYLOR and WOODRUFF:  It has been so long since I addressed the  saints through the medium of the Times and Seasons, that I feel confident that a few words  from my pen, by way of advice, will be well received, as well as a 'way mark' to guide the  'faithful' in future. I was sorry to learn, by  your remarks upon the resolutions of the 'Twelve' concerning your papers, which ap- peared not long since, that any of the saints  abroad were more apt to patronize the com- mon newspapers of the day, than yours: For  the important reason, that the church of Jesus  Christ of Latter Day Saints, has the words of  eternal life, and your paper, as it has hitherto  done, must continue to publish such portions  of them for the benefit of the saints, and the salvation of mankind, as wisdom shall, from  time to time, direct.  Freedom is a sweet blessing; men have a  right to take and read what papers they please: But do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of  thistles? It certainly is no more than just to  suppose that 'charity begins at home,' and if so,  what must such as profess to be saints think,  when they patronize the splendor of Babylon,  and leave the virtue of Zion to linger for want  of bread?  Beside which, if virtue is justified rather  than vanity: the best of every thing, calcula- ted to happify man, and dignify society, will,  yea, must be in Nauvoo: and as the new com- mandment, given anciently was, to love one  another; even so, the works of the saints, at  home and abroad, will bear its own testimony;  whether they love the brethren.  In all the world, the Times and Seasons- is  the only paper that virtually sustains, accord- ing to the forms of Scripture and prophecy,  'apostles, prophets, evangelists and revelations —and what shall be said of him that is like  the 'Levite' passes on the other side of the  way. When we behold men who 'have borne  the heat and the burden of the day;' strug- gled against the popular opinions of a vain  world, the burlesque of a giddy throng; the  vulgarity of a self-wise multitude, and the false- hoods of what may justly be termed the 'civil- ized meanness of the age,' and not lend a help- ing hand? The ##Matthew 25|25th chapter of Matthew## con- tains the simple answer.  Now let me say once for all, like the psalm- ist of old: 'How good and how pleasant it is  for brethren to dwell together in unity.'  As the precious ointment upon the head, that run down upon Aaron's beard, that went  down to the skirts of his garments, as the dew  of Hermon, that descended upon the mountains ENDENTRY of Zion, is such unity—for there the Lord com- manded the blessing—life forever more! Unity  is power, and when the brethren as one man, sustain the 'Times and Seasons,' they sustain  me, by giving a spread to the revelations, faith,  works, history, and progress of the church.— The brethren who conduct the paper have  been appointed to that important station be- cause they are worthy and well qualified, and  what a blessed sign of a faithful friend to God  and man is it, to see the charity of a brother  support his brethren as an evidence that he  means to pass from death into life?  Many of the articles which appear in the  Times and Seasons, are extracts of revelations, translations, or are the united voice of confer- ences, which like 'apples of gold in baskets of  silver,' are treasures more than meet for the  called, chosen, and faithful among the saints;  and should be more than drink to those that  hunger and thirst after righteousness. As Nau- voo is rising in glory and greatness, so shall I  expect to see the Times and Seasons increase in  circulation by the vigilance of the elders and  saints—so as to be a herald of truth, and a  standard of pure and undefiled religion. Fin- ally, men and brethren, when you support my  friends, you support me.  In the bonds of the  new and everlasting  covenant, I am your  humble servant,  JOSEPH SMITH. ENDENTRY North Columbia Cal. Dec 5 1892  Dear Uncle, Wilford Woodruff.  Undoubt- edly you will be surprised to receive a letter from me after my long silence. I am not real sure that I ans- wered your letter written after my father's death. Closely upon my papa's death my strength gave way from the severe strain and for a long time I was miserable to think of writing to any one. I dropped my social correspondense, and have never reopened all  of it.  Recently I heard through a friend of mine that another  friend of mine in Nevada City Cal. ENDENTRY (a Mr. Searles, lawyer) had a  picture of you in a book of his, and that the picture looked very much like my father, so I thought maybe you would send me a picture of yourself—a photograph if you had one to spare, if I wrote to you for it.  The Mr. Searles of whom I spoke above, is a son of Hon. Niles Searles, who was a  delegate to Washington D. C. last spring, to in behalf of the mining interests of California.  In your last letter to me and in fact, I think the  only one I have ever received from you, you mentioned the fact of often passing through Colfax. Some time, don't you ENDENTRY think you could arrange to run over to Nevada City and out to Columbia Hill for a visit? We would be so glad to see you, I know you must have a great  deal to occupy your time, and it is asking a good deal, to ask for a visit, but I hope some-day you can come, if not for longer  This is our first  pleasant day since Thanks- giving, and we enjoy the sun very much.
