I have belonged the 15th Ward for the lastyear or so, I always loved to attend the servicesin the Tabernacle. I went home to England to paymy Relatives a visit last fall as I had not seenany of my Folks for over 24 years.  I stayedin England about 5 months, my Folks offeredme great inducements if I would stay amongstthem, but I could not stay away from Zionso my Folks loaned me 18 pounds to pay myFare back to Zion. In the year 1871 I heard anElder preach the Gospel for the first time inmy life, I told the Elder I had been searchingthe Scriptures for years, but he had told me morein his one discourse than I could find by readingthe scriptures or dead Letter.  I told the ElderI was willing to forsake all sin and obey thecommandments of God all the rest of my lifeso the Elder Babtized me and confirmed methat I might recieve the holy Ghost, I never feltsuch a change as took place,  I felt I was cleans-ed from all my sins.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff thenasked as a favor of the wives, sonsand daughters, the family and friends of Brother Hyde, to granthim the freedom of making suchremarks as his spirit desired, and ifhe did not manifest as much mourn-ing as the occasion seemed to de-mand, he hoped they would pardonhim, for the vision of his mind wasopened to behold both sides of the vail.Elder Hyde was one of the FirstQuorum of the Twelve Apostles ofthis dispensation. There had been other quorums of Apostles, among the Nephites on this Continent,and in all probability among thepeople of Enoch, as well as in thedays of the Savior, in Jerusalem,but only a few more, if any, than ahundred had occupied this import-ant position among the many mil-lions of men that had been upon the earth from the founda-tion of the world; Brother Hydewas among that number. The firstElders of this Church, with theProphet Joseph at their head werenow rejoicing, the heavens also,with the prophets of every age and generation, at the birth of Brother Hyde in the spirit world. Thesewere the feelings that animiatedhim as he beheld the mortal re-mains of his brother; for he hadfilled his mission, he was safe andfree, and had accomplished his war-fare successfully, had been true andfaithful unto death, and he would receive a crown of life. He felt thankful for the liberty nowenjoyed by Brother Hyde, and these were the reasons he did notmourn his departure.There was only one of the firstquorum of the Twelve now remain-ing, and two only of the secondTwelve; such of the balance ashad been faithful were now enjoy-ing a happy greeting with theirnew-born brother in the spiritworld, and neither he nor theywould be willing to return if theyhad the opportunity. He hadtraveled with Brother Hyde up-wards of forty-five years, and was left the oldest member of the Twelve now living. This admon-ished him that his stay could not be very long, and were it not for the duties and obligations restingupon him he would desire to leave. As it was, he wished to stay and finish the work allotted him. Butdeath had no sting for him. He never felt to mourn the death of a saint that had been true and faith-ful, from the assurance the gospelgives of their gain. The only cause of mourning was the loss of theirsociety and the benefit of their as-sociations to those who remainedupon the earth; but to them it was most certainly a cause of rejoicing.Brother Hyde had been faithful inthe midst of his brethren to the last hour of his life. He was gladof this, for henceforth a great re-ward awaited him, and he would reign in the celestial kingdom. Hehad gone to prepare a place for hisfamily and his friends. He (Bro.Hyde) was, and is, an apostle of ourLord Jesus Christ, and he was wellsatisfied with his career and withhis labors, for he had been moved upon by the spirit of the Almightyin fulfillment of revelation, to bearhis testimony of the fulness of the gospel and also of the signs of the times among many people, and he had left that testimony to the world, and in his office and callingas one of the apostles of the Lord Jesus he would be one of thejudges of this generation.God had chosen the weak thingsof the world to carry on his work, and all that had been accomplishedhad been through the spirit, powerand blessing of God attending thosewhom he had chosen who werefaithful to their calling. The Lordchose Brother Hyde to be an apostle. He was faithful and dili-gent in bearing record of the thingsof God, on many missions and for a great many years. His mission toJerusalem alone was sufficient tohand his name down in honor tofuture generations. How quick, when the spirit, the immortalprinciple departed, the mortaltabernacle decayed! Nevertheless that same tabernacle in which heministered to his family and thechildren of men, will come forthfilled with immortality of spirit,sanctified and glorified in the morn-ing of the resurrection. He did notdeem it necessary to spend much time to eulogize Brother Hyde, as his labors were well known, and es-pecially in that locality. He hadlived to a good old age, but it was a short time compared with the end-less ages of eternity. But the modeand manner of our lives in this pro-bation predicate our destiny in our future condition. What manner ofpeople should we therefore be, tomake a good and wise use of theopportunity afforded us! WhetherBrother Hyde's spirit was present at these funeral exercises or with his friends in the spirit world hedid not know, for it had not beenrevealed. But one thing was cer-tain, that the spirit of Brother Hyde had with him all the bles-sings, sealings and ordinances ofthe new and everlasting covenantthat had been cconferred upon himin the flesh, by men holding theholy priesthood, and he will comeforth with his regenerated taberna-cle and reign upon the earth withhis Redeemer, whose footsteps hefollowed.Elder Woodruff closed his re-marks by giving comforting andconsoling words to the family ofthe deceased, exhorting them to be faithful that they might partici-pate with him in the blessings of the Father's kingdom worlds with-out end. 
 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFFthen took the stand, to make a fewremarks concerning the work ofmutual improvement. He looks for-ward to great and important resultsto be derived from these organisa-tions in which the Lord has a hand. Great responsibilities are resting up-on the young men of Israel; they will have to take the kingdom ofGod on their shoulders and bear itoff. Hence they ought to lay toheart the grandeur of their future destiny.The literary publication of this so-ciety, the Contributor, edited by ElderJunius F. Wells, is a good paper, ad-vancing correct principles. Thespeaker then contempates the ne-cessity imposed upon each and everyone of us to maintain his own iden-tity among the immense number ofhuman creations, the 1,400,000,000constituting mankind. No manshould try to imitate any other, butmaintain his own identity. All theTwelve have each his own original life. So every one else should do. Treasure up knowledge and informa-tion, obtain revelations and divineprinciples to guide you through life. Be careful in not contracting anyevil habits, as it is so hard to get ridof them. Take good, wholesome,godly reading and eschew the evilinfluence of the falsehoods and sick-ly imaginations contained in thoseimported story papers, novels and similar enervating stuff which leadsthe minds astray and fills them withincorrect, unrighteous impressions. Let us read history, learn of thingsand events that are true and real;but especially devote some portion of our time in reading the revelationsof the Lord, so as to be armedwith the principles of righteousness.A useful study are the lectures ofrhetoric by Prof. Blair of the Edin-burg University, full of learning and erudition, still, if our elders are filled with the spirit of the Lord, they willspeak to interest all mankind, wethink, even possessing all those rulesof oratory. Above all these thingslet us obtain revelations, the princi-ples of the Almighty. In our church,every man is a priest, a prerogativedenied all other generations of man-kind to this extent. Every man hassome influence, especially the Lat-ter-day Saints, and as far as we liveour religion, the blessing of the Lord will attend us. The speaker is anx-ious to see all the young membersbecome and remain righteous, virtu-ous, true, temperate. Whenever hefeels moved upon by the spirit ofGod to contemplate the great task before us, he sees how the wholespirit world, all the holy men whoever dwelt in the flesh, are over us,witnessing our doings and are lean-ing on us. Great works are requiredfrom us; so to build temples where toreceive sacred ordinances. Unfor-tunately, some of our elders are dis-regarding the word of wisdom, andaddict themselves to strong drinkwhich places them in an unpleasantlight before their heavenly Father. We want to so inculcate such principlesin our families that we can be blessedby reuniting with them in the morn-ing of resurrection. We must pre-pare ourselves to be strong enoughin the impending day of judgementwhen God will pour out the fullmeasure of His wrath over the wick-ed. The speaker closed by prayingthe Lord to help all of us to lead lives worth of eternal reward in His holy presence Amen

 Pres W. Woodward followed and bore his testimonyto the remarks of Brother Cannon, and stated that nopeople, were more blessed than the saints were.The Lord had raised up a people to whom he had givenhis Kingdom, and that Kingdom would remain, whenall earthly Kingdoms would pass away and the earth become a sea of glass and be celestial. Hereferred to enoch and his people, and the circumstances that was connected with their perfection, they becameso perfect that they could not remain here on the earthand spoke of the great blessings, that God had plasedbefore us, no other people had been so favoured as to live on the earth when God had established his Kingdomnever more to be turn down. he spoke of the oppositionthat spray up in the earth when God revealed himselfto Joseph the Prophet, and spoke of the Law of Tithing andremarked that the leaders of this church all pay their Tithing nonewere more punctual in doing so than they. He spoke of thepropreity of all paying their tithing at the proper time andaccording to the requirement. He spoke of the redemption of the dead, and showed the necessity of Temples, in consideration of which the Lord would enable us us to build and furnish ourTemples, that we may go on and officiate for our dead, agreat work remain for us to do, the departed dead areawaiting anxciously to the completion of our Temple and statedthat the Temple in trust was appropriatly of 50 cents in each monthnow for the Temple now in couse of erection. The Lordwas greatly blessing the saints in this Stake of Zionand we should be thankful to him for all the blessingswe enjoy, and continued by saying that it does not payfor men or women to apostitize, all who do so always failin their efforts.

 the other Brothern toleave at that datethat will be as earleyas I can leave on a countof getting means.This is all at present, I remain your Brother in the Gospel,William J. ChadwickW D Robinson Bishop 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff detailed thecircumstances that led to the events that transpired on Fishing River, and of the journey of Zion's Camp, and there in their distress and poverty, theelders consecrated all they had. The Twelve and probably others did like-wise when they arrived in the valley.If we had remained in Jackson County, half the prophecies of Isaiah would have remained unfulfilled. We are the descendents of Joseph, to whomthe promises were made, and the events of our history have been for our good. I believe that Joseph lived as long as the Lord wanted him to, and that he received every key pertaining to this dispensation and conferred them on his brethren, and that it was necessary that he should seal his testimony withhis blood.If our farmers had the spirit of someof the Nephites of old they would dedi-cate the ground and seed they sowed to the Lord.In Salt Lake some of the youth werevisiting bad places, but in the Church there were many young men who hon-ored God. 
 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFFtook the stand to address the Saints. He had met with the people of Ogden many times before, but he hadnot often had more occasion to feelgratified. In several meetings, yes-terday, he had been glad to witness a good spirit and prayer meetings hadbeen organized. The speaker thenpointed out how by the principle offaith the people of God had been preserved in every age and time of the world. He will always sustain us if we exercise faith and obey Hislaw. Through faith the world was created, Noah built his ark, Abra-ham went he knew not whither, thethree youths were preserved in the fiery furnace and Daniel in the lion'sden. [##Hebrews 11:7-8##] [##Daniel 3##] [##Daniel 6##] Without the spirit of the Lordwe can accomplish nothing, and inorder for us to obtain it, God hasconferred the holy priesthood upon us. We must unite our hearts in a feeling of harmony, in order to es-tablish the Kingdom of God. Invarious ages the Lord has visited thewicked and iniquitous with Hispunishments, while the people ofIsrael were prospered and preservedas long as they obeyed His law. Inthe same ways the Father has dealt with the human family and withHis elect people ever since. The speaker knows of no generation thathas been blessed and favored with such great privileges as we are in thisdispensation. Such indeed, was thatof Abraham, also those of the ancientprophets and apostles. Jesus camein the meridian of time that throughhim all the human family should besaved and redeemed, as throughAdam all had fallen and died. ElderWoodruff here gave a sketch of the Saviour mission of Christ. We know that all these missions in the variousepochs of the world's history wereof God, some of the prophets having been fore-ordained before they wereborn, as were Jeremiah of old, andthe Prophet Joseph in the latter-days. [##Jeremiah 1:5##] This the speaker illustrated by the early history of the prophet. The Lord always had a plan withHis creations, although the speakerdoes not believe in predestination. But there are noble spirits in thespirit world and them the Lord hassent to set up and establish His Kingdom. The Lord raised up theProphet Joseph, He also raised up Twelve Apostles, and every Latter-day Saint. He has searched themout from among all the nations ofthe world and brought them hitherto assist in the building up of theKingdom. This kindgom is to standunto the coming of the Son of man.We have all been called to assist init, from a thousand or fourteen hun-dred million of people. Thereforewe certainly have nothing else to do, no other business than to build upthis Kingdom; if we build it up, webuild up ourselves, and if we neglect it, we fall. The Lord looks to noother people than to the Latter-day Saints to perform His work. Hencewe must be united in the gospel andin the love of the Lord. For noconsideration we should sacrifice our eternal salvation. Our aimis high and glorious and our missionis sublime above all others. If we overcome our weaknesses, we willhave power to finish all our temples, to dedicate them, to perform workfor the dead in them. We can enter into the glory of God, be face to face with the Heavenly Father, if we keep the covenants. Let us, there-fore, be one; be ready to forgive, letus never think we have so much dignity that we need no instructionor chastisement. Let us be humbleand ponder what we are here for. Earth and hell are against us, the world hate us, and this is one of the principal proofs that God is ourfriend and will fight our battles, if we are faithful to Him and His com-mands.The Lord wants us to spreadabroad, Zion's border must be en-larged and her stakes lengthened.Thus we are settling in Arizona; the head and center of our settlements there is St. John in Apache Co. Now there are thirty families wanted fromthis stake, to go thither to settle thecountry, it takes men with means to build up the country there and secure a strong foothold in that part of the country. The hives of Israelare crowded and the bees are com-mencing to swarm. 
 QUARTERLY CONFERENCEOf the Y. M. M. I. A. of Weber CountyAPOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFFgave utterance to the great pleasurehe had derived from the exercisesof the day. He also paid a tributeto the efficiency of the services of Elder Jos. A. West, whose absenceat this meeting he regretted. Re-ferring to the testimonies borne by the young Elders and their counselon religious topics, he comparedthem favorably with the learnedrhetorical sermons which a HenryW. Beecher and other worldly divines might deliver, but withoutinteresting or edifying the Saints ofGod.The Mutual Improvement Asso-ciations are powerful contributorsto the welfare of the people of Isra-el and the promotion of the inter-ests of the Kingdom.Apostle Woodruff then declaredthat there is no people on earththat can less afford to waste time inreading novels, stories, and othertrashy, valueless literature than theLatter-day Saints. Their sole oc-cupation should be the pursuit of truth and the acquisition of knowl-edge. If a Saint gets tired reading the Bible and Book of Mormon, lethim obtain historical works, suchas Rollins' Ancient History, wherethey can learn the ways in whichthe Lord dealt with the various na-tions of the earth in the days of old.Many useful lessons can be learnedfrom the history of old Babylon,Nineveh, Tyre, Sidon, Thebes,Memphis, and other great and pow-erful cities and peoples of ancientdays. Study of history is beneficialbecause instructing, while readingof fiction is detrimental, because de-moralizing.The work of improvement inthese associations is greatly neededto assist in building up the lastKingdom of God in the dispensa-tion of times. Somebody has got tobear it off amidst all these tremen-dous events hovering on the thresh-old of the future. It is our youngmen that have got to do it, andtherefore the speaker takes a greatinterest in their work. JosephSmith had all this in his mind andhe often spoke about the Kingdomof God to be established in the Rocky Mountains. How great andastounding the contrast between1847 and nowadays! And as it grew and increased, developed and progressed in the past, it will de-velop and expand in the future, andall the powers of earth and hell can-not hinder it. This these young Elders have to help bring about,therefore they have no time to wastein foolishness and idleness. Theyare heirs of the priesthood and theinstruments in the hands of theAlmighty to accomplish His greatpurposes.He felt to say to the young menand women, "God bless you!" They would be clothed with powerand glory of God and would have agreat work to do amid all the wars, bloodshed, pestilence, earthquakes, tempests, and devastations about tocome. The speaker closed with a prayer that the Lord may continueto bless and prosper the associationsof the young. 
 Apostle Wilword Woodruff: The Lord showed Abraham many noble spirits, and said of them he would make the rulers in his Kingdom. No generation was ever called to do a greater work than is required of the Elders of Israel in these last days.In connection with our duties to the living is the redemption of the dead.  Because Congress is opposed to us, and because our enemies are making our overthrow we should not relax our ef-forts, but we should continue our work upon our temples, and inasmuch as we are faithful, we will have power to finish them and dedicate them, and work in them.Can the elders of Israel deny their religion? Can they deny God? Can they deny and desert their wives and families that have been given them un-der the law of God? No. Our ene-mies may fine, imprison or put us to death, but we cannot deny these things. 
 SUNDAY 2 P.M.Opening exercises: prayer by ElderJohn Van Cott. The authorities of theChurch and of this Stake were nextpresented by Pres. Wm. B. Preston,and sustained by the conference. Elder Wilford Woodruff addressed the con-ference. We should all see alike withregard to the work of God. I havenever had any fears regarding thiswork, and the fulfillment of revelation.The Lord intends to fulfill all the promises He has made to the children of men. The Lord would not com-mence such a work as this unless Heknew He had power to complete it.He can build up this kingdom with a few or with many. Our progress de-pends upon ourselves to a great extent. There have been few men in any agewho have had independence of mindenough to live up to the requirements of the gospel, and to make the sacrificesit requires. Hence the world isblinded, in regard to the gospel. Aman must be born of the Spirit of lightand truth before he can see this king-dom. Hence the world are in darkness.They will not receive the testimony ofthe servants of God. If a man willopen his heart to the truth and asklight of God, he will become born ofthe spirit. When an elder of thischurch rasies his voice in testimony ofthe truth, the power of God accompan-ies it, and the spirit of truth shows thetruth to the people, and when they re-ject it the leaves them. Thereason why the Saints are here, is be-cause they listened to the testimony ofthe servants and Spirit of God.Whatever law a person keeps, he will receive the glory of that law, and if he cannot abide the law of a kingdomof glory, he cannot inherit such a king-dom. When a person, a family, or a nation rejects the gospel, the lightthey have will withdraw from them.Such men as Calvin, Wesley, and Luth-er had been inspired of God, but they did not establish the Church of Christ. The Catholic Church held rule for1,000 years, but it never had the priest-hood. Such men as Wesley will hearthe gospel in the spirit world.We have the Gospel, the Holy Spiritand the priesthood. Would we sellthese things? Any man who ceaseshis prayers is in danger. We shouldlabor, study, and read, and try to pre-pare ourselves for our duties. Thepresent generations is very corrupt, andthe world is full of wickedness. Ourprosperity depends upon our own con-duct, and if we will keep the command-ments of God, Zion will not be removed out of her place, and we will have power to finish these temples and worktherein. If we would do right we would have power to remain here. In nogeneration has there been more testi-mony and revelation than we have en-joyed. As Saints we cannot magnifyour calling nor perform our duties with-out the Spirit of God. When John theBaptist, and Peter, James and Johnvisited Joseph Smith, it was not a vis-ion. They came to him as one manmight come to another, and there wasno vision about it. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] The inspiration of the Holy Ghost has strong a testimonyof the truth of this work as a man canhave. I have had no stronger testi-mony than that of the Holy Ghost. Ifwe go to the prophets and holy men inthe spirit world, we will have to obey the same law that they did. 
 The Daily Junction.ISSUED EVERY EVENING.(Except Sunday,) by The Junction Printing Association1(INEORPORATED,)Office corner of Main and Fourth Streets. Address all communications on business to theBusiness Manager; those intended for publicationto the Editor. MONDAY EVENING, JAN. 24, 1881.QUARTERLY CONFERENCEOf the Weber Stake of Zion, in OgdenTabernacle.ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFFaddressed the congregation whichwas exceedingly large. Elder Wood-ruff took up the subject of emigrationto Arizona. He said that all our la-bor of settling Southern Utah and Arizona had been accomplished un-der great difficulties, many peopleeven despairing of the possibility of redeeming the apparently sterile soil.Brother Eldredge himself, when senton a mission thither, went and re-ported back that "the country aboutSt. George stood all up edgewise."Now St. George is a very garden ofEden, producing excellent fruit. There the Church has erected a Tem-ple in which as many as 100,000 bap-tisms have taken place. Difficult also was the first settling of Arizona, the first mission thither returning unsuccessful. But others were sentand now they have flourishing set-tlements. However forbidding a country may look to us, we can neverfind a country more unpromising than Utah looked on the 24th ofJuly, 1847, when first entered by thePioneers. Lot Smith was sent Southand he succeeded in establishing set-tlements. There are Sunset and Brigham City, on the two banks of Little Colorado River. Elder Wood-ruff then gave a description of the country and how he found it himself. When he went up the Little Colora-do River, below Sunset, he found itdried up for about 50 miles; butwhen they got up to Sunset theyfound water enough to run a grist-mill all the year round and to irri-gate 1,000 acres. There also was a sufficiency of timber, as near as onemile from Sunset. The country wasone field of bunch grass, for milesand miles around, forming an excel-lent herding ground. The people of Sunset and Brigham had organized in the shape of forts. They lived in United Order, each settlement foritself. They had fine herds of cattle,both in the forts and on a dairy in a fertile valley, called Pleasant Valley. They raised all kinds of grain inabundance and of good quality. Inthe San Francisco mountains is a fineforest of timber, from 6 inches to 4feet thick and 50 to 150 feet high. St. Joseph is 25 miles up the river;25 miles further is Woodruff: 25 miles more, up the river, is another place,and several more in the vicinity. The Little Colorado River furnishes am-ple water for all purposes. Sunsetonce looked very unfruitful; nowonly 11 men and boys were employ-ed at farming, harvesting thousandsof bushels of wheat and corn, the finest ever seen in the West. TheLatter-day Saints there are able tosustain themselves from the productsof the work of the soil. The United Order is working most harmoniously,no swearing, drinking or quarrelinggoing on. The Order shows most ex-cellent fruits of union, peace, all thepeople showing the greatest willing-ness to obey the authorities and paytithings and donations. Elder Wood-ruff then treated of St. John, the county seat of Apache county, whereformerly all bad elements of the out-side world would congregate—Jews,Gentiles, Mexicans and others: The Church now has bought the land around there and emigration is wished to secure possession. A goodman is placed in authority as Bishop,a man who does right and just. Menare needed to go there to help settlethe place which is the key to the whole of Apache county. About 200families are required, as it is a large country, peopled by many thousandsof the Lamanites, located in villages,all except the Navajos and Apaches. These Lamanites are waiting for the Latter-day Saints to come and ad-minister to them. The Church wantsto settle Arizona, New Mexico, and a whole chain of settlements into the very heart of Old Mexico. St. John is a very good place for farming, theLittle Colorado River flowing directlythrough it: there is even a natural dam of stone which enables the peo[-]ple with little trouble and labor to irrigate their lands. About 30 fami-lies are desired out of this Stake to go to St. John. But there is to be nocompulsion about it, all are to befree about it. Those called upon togo must consider their interest. Prest. Taylor does not want to op-press the people or to call them to goagainst their will. All who like to go,with willing hearts and ready mindsare expected to avail themselves ofthe opportunities. There is one finestretch of land there, called the Col-orado Meadows, from 15 miles longto 3 or 4 miles wide. Elder Wood-ruff wished the brethren to considerthe matter carefully and those whoare disposed to go and hand in theirnames to the President and get readyas soon as possible, as it is a long journey, of about 700 miles. The Latter day Saints want an outlet tothe South and the speaker hopes that we will obtain a foothold in the country of Mexico. There are tensof thousands of the pure blood of Lehi down there, whose minds areopen and eagerly awaiting the com-ing of the Latter-day Saints. The Navajos are our special friends andmany have been converted and bap-tized.Elder Woodruff then endorsed theremarks made in the forenoon byElder Joseph F. Smith, about the intents of the hearts of man. Hewould never oppress or oppose anywhatever he pleased. The Lord Him-self never forced any one to belief. He has placed good and evil, faith and unbelief before the children ofmen and they can exercise their ownfree agency. Such is also the spirit of the Consititution of the UnitedStates which guarantees full religiousfreedom to all.Another important point is the re-demption of the dead. This is a subject of momentous weight. There are millions and millions in the spirit world, for whom a work has tobe accomplished. It takes just asmuch to save a dead man asit takes to save a live one. Great responsibilities are resting upon us,to do a work for our numerous re-lations in the spirit world. The speaker then gave a touching de-scription of the tender relations be-tween children and their motherand showed how great is our respon-sibility towrds our fathers and ourfathers' houses. Elder Woodruffhimself has been baptized 3,000 timesfor other people, which should bean example to others. This will bea great consolation and joy for him; so it will be to all the Saints who have done the proper work for theirprogenitors and other kin. In the spirit world we will only be privil-eged to unite with those of our friends whom we have redeemed while in the flesh, hence we shouldeagerly avail ourselves of the glor-ious opportunity of the great and mighty work.The work of building temples is a great and urging one. It is worthmore than all the gold and silver wemay obtain. There is no money inapostatizing, or committing any sin.If there is any glory, it is in menwho will stand up in defense of theGospel of Christ and when troublescome will be found valiant championson the watch towers of Zion. Insuch men Elder Woodruff glories,as in Elder Joseph F. Smith, the sonof the martyred Hyrum. He is ableto preach the gospel of temperance,because he himself lives it and henobly fills the exalted position towhich he has been called, and willone day even occupy the highest. The speaker concluded with a pow-erful testimony to the great bless-ings emanating from the Temples erected to the name of the Most High, and an impressive exhorta[-]tion to the Saints to be solicitousand eager in the fulfillment of allthe duties devolving upon us, at-tending to their prayers, for thenthe Lord would continue to prosperand protect the people in peace and plenty. 
 STAKE CONFERENCE.The Semi-Annual Conference of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion con-vened in the Assembly Hall thismorning at 10 o'clock.There were present on the stand,President Wilford Woodruff, of the Twelve Apostles; the Presidency ofthe Stake, Angus M. Cannon, DavidO. Calder and Joseph E. Taylor, andothers. Singing, "Let Zion in her beauty rise," etc. Prayer was offeredby Elder Lauritz Smith.  Singing, "Glorious things of thee arespoken."President David O. Calder waspleased to meet with the Saints in aConference capacity, though therewere but few present. Spoke of theimportance of being punctual, and where this was neglected in regardto meetings it was generally an in-dex of character in other mattersboth of a spiritual and temporalnature. The practice of punctuality created a feeling of confidence in us towards those who were punctual, and as a rule thosewho were the busiest and whovalued time the most highly would be found the most prompt. He regretted the indifference thatwas exhibited by many of theSaints in regard to such meetings, as these, seemingly being lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. It came with a bad grace from theLatter-day Saints to offer as an ex-cuse for profaning the Sabbath day,that they were so much confinedduring the week, in view of the many holidays we had, and the healthy location and labor in whichthe people were generally engaged.The roll was called, showing two Patriarchs and four Presidents of Seventies present.The 1st, 3rd, 5th, 11th, 12th, 13th15th and 16th Elders Quorums.All the Wards of the Stake wererepresented by presiding authorities, excepting the 1st, 14th and 20th Salt Lake City, and the Mill Creek and Granite Wards.The following reports were read:A Statistical report of the Stakefor the Quarter ending May 31st,1882, showing a net increase for thatterm of 168 souls.Reports from the 3rd, 11th and18th Quorums of Elders, and a Sta-tistical and Financial report of Y.M. M. I. Association, for the year ending March 31st, 1882.President Joseph E. Taylor spokeof the necessity of such organizationof the Stake being represented iniew of the importance of the busi-ness transacted. The time had beenwhen the cares of the world wouldnot have caused the Elders of Israelto forget an occasion of this import-ance. Much had to be accomplishedby the people of God. The questionwas who were expected to accom-plish these labors? There were dutiesdevolving respectively upon everybranch of the Priesthood and everymember of the church, and the neg-ligence of one affected the whole.It was the duty of Presidents to make themselves familiar with themembers of their repective quor-ums, and they should labor with the same interest that a father would have for his children, with a view to check wrong-doing and en-courage righteousness, being ex-amples themselves of the principlesthey sought to inculcate. The dutiesof each branch of the Priesthood were clearly defined and if a man's wholetime was not occupied he should first perform the duties of his callingin the Priesthood, and the Lord would bless his substance and pro-vide abundantly for his necessi-ties.President Wilford Woodruff re-lated an anecdote to show that thepeople in many instances took more interest in trifling matters than in those of importance. There were few who realized the importance of our calling and position. The eyes of millions in the spirit world were upon this people as upon them de-pended this work and the accom-plishment of prophecies which had been uttered by the prophets since the biginning of the world and ofothers yet to be revealed which hadbeen hid from the foundation of theworld. The Priesthood we held was of the same nature as that by which the worlds were created. In view of the great responsibilities de-volving upon us we could not affordto neglect our duties. He testified that he had found it easier to sup-port his family since they had become numerous than when they were but few. Thousands of this people had been foreordained tocome and accomplish the labor we were now engaged in. Referred to the blessings restored to the Saints in our day and the provi-dences of God that had con-tinually ruled the destinies of Hispeople. In view of the blessings we enjoy and the responsibilities de-volving upon us we should be care-to keep our covenants and observethe commandments of God.Adjourned until 2 p.m.The choir sang the hymn, "Guide us, O thou great Jehovah."Benediction by Bishop Isaac M.Stewart. 
 President Wilford Woodruff saidthat young men were taken fromthe various vocations of life andsent forth to proclaim the Gospel tothe people of the nations of theearth in their own tongues. Thiswork was one that had been spokenof by the ancient prophets, and noone could reject it who could sin-cerely believe the Bible. God hadrestored the Gospel through theProphet Joseph strictly in accord-ance with the prophecies uttered byhis servants anciently, and thiswas the same Gospel that wastaught by them, and theChurch was organized in thesame way and by the same authority as the Church ofChrist anciently. No man had au-thority to administer the ordinancesof the Gospel unless he was call-ed of God, and all promises or ordi-nances made without that author-ity would end with death. TheSaints had been persecuted more be-fore the principle of celestial marri-age was revealed than since. Thiswas the only principle by which wecould claim our family relationshipon the other side of the vail. TheLord had verified the truth of thetestimonies of the Elders of Israelto all who obeyed their words in honesty of heart. We were engagedin an important work and it be-hooved us as Saints to keep our cov-enants. 
 Pres. W. Woodruff next addressed themeeting; he spoke upon the proper train-ing of the young. He had no one totrain him in the gospel in his childhooddays. He spoke of the loss sustained byour memories becoming forgetful of-times neglecting thing of vital import-ance. He spoke of the great labor de-volving upon the Saints, in building upZion, and the temples, in ordaining forthe dead, and of their redemption. In St. George, since the dedication of theTemple, we had baptized for 150,000souls. Our duty in the world was towarn the people of the second coming ofthe Son of God, to proclaim the fullnes ofthe gospel to all nations. He spoke of the far-reaching efforts of this work af-fecting the past present and future. All nations were more or less trouble to us.He related a dream in which Prest.Young appeared to him and told him toteach the people to strive for the spirit of God and be governed by it, if all hadHis spirit none would apostatise and turnaway from God. We should labor forthe riches of the gospel. A few personshad been gathered up here from the na-tions to co-operate with the Almighty inthe great latter-day work. He referredto the first time which he heard Josephthe Prophet speak, when he declaredthey little knew the greatness of thework they were then laying the founda-tion of. He also spoke of the salvationof the Lamanites, and hoped all wouldstrive for more of the spirit. 
 APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF.The speaker read a considerableportion of the vision given to theProphet Joseph, in which was shownthe condition of the dead, and said:Jesus knew that millions of Jewswould suffer the consequences of hispersecution and death, hence he waswilling to forgive his enemies. Itwas upon this principle that the prophets in ancient times were wil-ling to forgive their enemies and sealtheir testimonies with their blood.The world are ignorant as to the condition of the dead in a futurestate, and what rewards and punish-ments will be given. But we mayall know by the visions and revela-lations God has given us what ourfuture condition will be. If youknow what law you kep, you mayknow what your future state will be.Our enemies ought to be patientand let these "Mormons" alone for a little while, for they will not betroubled with "Mormons" nor po-lygamy after death. The "Mormons" are keeping a higher law than theyare, and after the judgement there will be an eternal separation betweenthem and their opponents.As the kingdom of God has con-tinued to increase in the past thehowls of its enemies have increasedalso, and as the kingdom continuesto grow in future, so will the wrathof our enemies, and we will have thiswarfare upon our hands until satanis bound.There is nothing concerning man that I glory in more than to see himvaliant in the testimony of Jesus.We should study the revelationsfor they are profitable for our instruc-tion and edification. It is an un-speakable priviledge to officiate assaviors upon Mount Zion. We aregathered from all nations and standas the representatives and Saviors ofthe dead of all nations.There is one thing in connectionwith this dispensation that alwaysgives me great satisfaction. It is the great and last dispensation in which God has decreed that His church should stand and prosper.We have far more joy than do ourenemies. We can offer up our pray-ers at night, retire and sleep sweetly, and we feel well, happy and con-tented. 
 President Wilford Woodruff in listening to the reports given to-day,was reminded of the parable of theten Virgins. He felt that the timehad come for the Priesthood either to magnify their callings or repudi-ate them, for if there ever was atime when the Priesthood should befaithful, it was the present. Theypossessed the keys and authority tominister in the ordinances of the Gospel for the living and the dead,and such men had too much to do to lend themselves to evil practices.The Priesthood should be clothedupon with the spirit of revelation to direct them in the performance of their duties. It was important thatall should be faithful in attendingtheir meetings and in the perform-ance of all other duties, for this work did not devolve alone upon the leaders of the Church, but each one had a work to perform. Those who had passed through theearly scenes of our history as a peo-ple were passing away, and it wasimportant that the Priesthood should qualify themselves to carry on the work. He felt especially im-pressed with the importance of building temples that ordinancesfor themselves and thousands ofthose who have passed away with-out an opprtunity of receiving theGospel might be performed. Hefeared that we did not realize the importance of our callings. Thepower of God that would exist in the last days would be manifested through the Priesthood. Josephwas endowed with the spirit of hiscalling which was also enjoyed by those who succeed him. The Priesthood should be selected fromthose whose lives were devoted tothe building up of the kingdom. He illustrated the mournful condition those who denied the faith afteronce partaking of the spirit of life,while there were no happier peopleon earth than those who were faith-ful, no matter what their circum-stances were, this was exemplified in the indifference that was mani-fested concerning the efforts that were made to destroy this people.  He felt that there would be an awakening among the people andthat the work of God would increase until it prevailed in the earth. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said the Church and kingdom of God were organzied permanently, as also the various aids pertaining to it. If the associations organized to im-prove the young were a benefit to one they would be a benefit to all, hence the young should avail them-selves of their advantages, and he would advise all the young to iden-tify themselves with these institu-tions, that they might grow up un-der an influence that would enable them to avoid the evils that existed among us. He felt to encourage the sisters of the Relief Societies, especi-ally referring to their labors to store up grain, for the day of the Lord was at hand. The sisters were also doing much good in many other respects. The judgments of God, of war, of famine and pestilence were at our doors, and it behooved us to prepare for those times.Those who held the Priesthood should be enrolled in some Quorum.  There was a mighty host in Israel holding the Priesthood, and they should be alive to their duties, that the power of their callings might attend, and Zion would continue to grow and increase in the earth. It was especially im-portant that the young should grow up in the fear of God. He concluded by invoking the blessings of God upon the Priesthood and all of the institutions of Zion. 
 PRESIDENT W. WOODRUFFnext addressed the congregation,expressing the great interest he takesin the work of mutual improve-ment. He had been greatly edifiedby the reports of the young breth-ren, to-day, and he derived greatconsolation from the fact that theyoung are doing so well in the workof the Gospel. He rejoices in it,the holy ones in Israel rejoice in it;the spirits rejoice in it; for they know that it is upon the youth of Zion that the work of the Kingdomwill eventually rest. When theChurch was organized, it was or-ganized to stay; and when the Y. M. M. I. A. was organized it alsowas organized to stay. The young people have organized upon a war-fare—the world, the flesh, and the devil (and a good many devils, or fallen spirits). This warfare our young are expected to carry on. It will extend, and there is nothingmore God-like than for our youngpeople, in midst of all the abomina-tions of the world, to stand upagainst them and fight them reso-lutely. A great many of the oldsoldiers of Church have passed, others are passing away, and the speaker desires to strengthen thefaith of his young brethren andsisters. Zion is going to have the victory, of this he feels assured. There is a change awaiting Zion,and a change is also awaiting Baby-lon.It is marvelous to see the positionof our Church to day with the powers of all the earth and hell arrayedagainst it. The only fear is that the Saints might become proud oftheir blessings and forget the Heav-enly Father. We should be thank-ful for our prosperity, peace, andwealth, humbling ourselves beforethe Lord and listening to His, counsel; for He has set His hand to the great work of salvation and is going to accomplish it.The speaker then gave the youngsome excellent counsel, pointing out to them what great things theyare destined in the near future.Our people occupy the most pecu-liar position of any in the world.All the nations of the earth are di-recting their attention towards"Mormonism," and they are lookingforward to something to save themfrom the impending universal crash.Our young men will have to standamongst Kings and rulers, to givecounsel and warning; hence they should cultivate gentility, goodmanners, affability, "polishing"themselves, so to speak, that theymay find ready reception and exer-cise influence. In this respectPresident Woodruff imparted valu-able advice to the young, a gooddeal of which was just as adaptableto the elder ones, as for instance,not to break into conversation butto wait until a speaker is through.Never, also, indulge in jealousy orprejudice, whatever position we may occupy. One-third part of heaven fell on account of jealousy,and we have to be very careful in re-fraining from this evil spirit which would ruin the best man in Israeland never leads to anything butquarrel and war. We should al-ways be kind and forgiving to oneanother, not speak evil of our neigh-bors, but always keep before oureyes the principle of the GoldenRule: Do unto others as we wishto be done by.In regard to prayer the speakeradmonished the Saints to cling untothe Lord. This is an age of infideli-ty, when priests and people alike areturning away so far from the Lordthas they can no more believe in Him. God never did anything ex-cept He did it by revelation throughthe power of the Eternal Priesthood,and it is through the principles of thePriesthood that man does anything.Everyone can receive revelations, although there is only one at a timeto be a lawgiver unto the Church. The speaker here explained the keysof the Melchisedek Priesthood, to hold converse with the Father. Butalso the Aaronic Priesthood has itspower with the Heavens, the keys of ministration with the angels. Ifwe have not these blessings we fallfar short of our calling. We all en-joy the privilege of calling on theLord and obtaining wisdom from Him. That "still small voice" with-in us is the spirit of God, guidingand directing us in all things if wehearken to and follow it. Thesethings our young should learn andthey should cultivate prayer, to bein constant communication withtheir Heavenly Father. We shouldgo to the Lord for all our needs andwants. President Woodruff herereferred to the revelation of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smithin answer to his prayer while inprison. The Heavens are full ofrevelations, and we have many ofthem in our books which we shouldstudy and ponder upon.The Twelve Apostles have beencalled upon to go to the house ofIsrael, among whom the Lord isperforming His work, as the speakerrelated by several instances latelyoccured, in Arizona when Laman-ites received ministrations. Amongthem was a prophesy that a greatwar was before this nation whichwould extend all over the land; andthere would also by a great famineafter three years of plenty. TheBible is full of famine, Brother Kimbal used to preach famine, and we should be prepared for it. Es-pecially the sisters of the Relief Societies should continue the goodwork of laying up bread-stuff and the brethren should help them init. The famine will come surely, and so will war, and pestilence, andearthquakes, and all the other judg-ments of God. He holds us in Hishand and He also holds the Gentiles,and hence we have the strength ifwe are faithful.We should also be diligent in se-curing and saving a record of our dead that we may go into the holyplaces and redeem them.President Woodruff concludedhis interesting discourse with an ex-hortation to the young to be valiantin the testimony of Jesus Christ,that they may become joint heirswith Him in Heaven; and with aprayer to God that He may pour out the Holy Ghost upon all HisSaints. 
 APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFFsaid: Sixteen years ago I visitedLogan with President Young. The boys and girls turned out to meet us,and we held a meeting in the Bowery.President Young asked me to talkI did so, and predicted that manywho were present would yet be per-mitted to stand on top of a Templeerected upon the bench overlookingthis city, and look down from thenceover tens of thousands of Latter-daySaints, whose homes would be in this valley. At that time, no one as faras I know, had thought of erecting a Temple there, but we see the predic-tion fulfilled.The speaker related a strikingdream which he had in Boston, in the early days of the Church, inwhich he saw the Saints assemble inthe Rocky Mountains, build a Temple,and engage in sacred work therein.In this dream, he also saw the Laman-ites enter the Temple, and he beheld them working in it. This dream washad long before any one in theChurch, so far as was known, enter-tained the thought of the Saints coming to these valleys.The speaker discoursed upon theprogress the work of God is makingin these montains, and exhorted theSaints to be united in their politicalas well as all their other interests and affairs. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.I listened yesterday with much in-terest to the reports of the Bishopsand of the societies. The Lord hassaid He would do nothing but Hewould reveal his secrets to His ser-vants the prophets. This dispensa-tion is one in which will be pouredout the judgements of God upon the wicked, it is a dispensation of thepeaching of the gospel to all nations;the gathering of the honest and ofthe pruning of the vineyard for thelast time. From the history of the world we learn that value exalteth a people but sin is a reproach to anypeople. Sin has always overthrownany nation that has practiced it. Thehistory of the children of Israel showsin many instances the effects of sin.The Lord would use a heathen kingor nation with which to Chastisethem when they did wickedly.No man can even read in the scrip-tures of any change in the ordinance of the House of God. Adam andMoses, had we been with them,would have taught us faith in the Mes-siah, and baptism for the remissionof sins, as ordinances of salvation. Enoch, Abraham and all the ancientprophets taught the same plan ofsalvation as did the prophet Joseph Smith. There has been no changein those ordinances during the last6,000 years.In our day there have been the most wonderful discoveries and in-ventions ever brought forth in anyage. It was in the year 1807, the year in which I was born, that steam-boats were invented by Fulton andnow the ocean is covered with them. In what age before this was such a thing as a car propelled by steamseen? Isaiah saw one in vision bear-ing the Saints to the mountains, butno man before our age ever saw sucha thing except in a vision.In this same age among all thesewonderful inventions and discoverieswe have a new religion or rather anew covenant. The Lord has brought forth a prophet and called forth hischurch out of the wilderness to beestablished in these mountains. Thedescendants of Israel, of Ephraim,who have been scattered and sifted among the nations, are being gather-ed out. This is the work of theLord and not of man; conceived inthe mind of the Lord, and brought forth according to His will. Satan knows that by the spread of thiswork his power will be limited and hewill finally be bound.Therefore as Saints we have a greatwork resting upon us. We are calledto proclaim the gospel to the nations and gather out the honest. The Lord has promised to gatherout Zion and establish his peoplethough a woman might forget Thesucking child, He cannot forget Zi[on]There has never been a dispensa-tion of the gospel like the present one. This is different from any thathas preceded it. It embraces all thathas been given in the past. The Lordis blessing His Saints here withwealth, but let them not fogetGod. He has decreed that Zion shallnot be removed out of her place,therefore if Zion commits sin she willbe chastized until she purifies herself.Therefore serve the Lord, pay yourtithes, assist in building Temples, at-tend your prayers and live your re-ligion faithfully. 
 APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF.I am pleased to meet with so manyof our young brethren this morning. I read The Preceptor as soon as itwas out of the press. None of usare so old that we cannot learn, and I thought that if I had always ob-served the teachings of that little book I would probably have accom-plished a great deal more good in the course of my life than I have. When I first embraced the gospel it seemed to me that I could convert every-body to it, so plain was it to mymind. But I fould myself mistaken. I never asked any kind of an office in my life, but I did ask of the Lordthe privilege of preaching the gospel.Not that I desired thereby to gainthe honor of men, nor because Ithought it an easy task, but therewas a Spirit in me that caused me todesire to preach the truth. If we ever attain to a celestial glory, to aninheritance in the presence and king-dom of God, we must obey the lawupon which that blessing is predi-cated. We must keep the law of God, or we are not qualified to preach it. I am anxious for the welfare andprogress of the work of mutual im-provement. It was instituted for good and has already been the meansof accomplishing much good. But Ido not think it is yet thoroughtly or-ganized and it is necessary to intro-duce improvements in this respect.A great diversity of opinion existsamong the Saints regarding a testi-mony of the gospel. Some think thatin order to obtain a testimony, some marvelous manifestation, as for ex-ample, the visitation of an angel is absolutely necessary. Butthis idea is incorrect. When a person has obeyed the gospel andbeen baptized, and has received thelaying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, it is the privilege of that person to enjoy the whispering ofthat Spirit, which speaks in a stillsmall voice, and it is the privilege ofthat person to receive a testimony bythe inspiration of that Spirit. I have had many marvelous manifestationsduring my experience in this Church,but I never had so conclusive a tes-timony of the truth of this work as the whisperings of that Spirit.Well may Brother Thatcher saythat these associations are not estab-lished to afford amusement to our young people. They were not estab-lished for any such a purpose. They were designed to afford our young people opportunities of gaining aknowledge of the gospel, and to becomequalified to bear it to the humanfamily.I have sometimes heard elders re-mark that some other brother hadbeat them in preaching; or say that they were afraid that someone wouldbeat them in preaching. Such re-marks always strike me very unfa-vorably. I do not like to hear them. I was never afraid that some one else would beat me in preaching, or obtain above me any honor in the things of the Kingdom of God, for Iknow that any desirable honor I everobtain must come from God. 
 APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFFWhen I look at the creations of GodI often marvel at the infinite varietywhich I see therein. This eternalvariety was shown among the spiritsof men in the eternal world, and therewas a gradation of spirits before cre-ation just the same as after the birthof men. The Lord has said he would take of the noble spirits and makerulers in His kingdom. Very fewmen in any age of the world sincethe days of Adam, have been willing to receive the word of the Lord and work in harmony with Him. So it isto-day. Out of 11,000,000,000 peo-ple now on the earth only a few haveembraced the gospel. The feeling ofthis generation is, "Give me gold and silver; I do not want the salvationyou offer." You are forming your characters. I am forming mine. If I commit sin it must be paid forsomewhere, if not in time, then ineternity. The secret acts andthoughts and intents of men are tobe revealed by the angels of the Lord.The angels that will reveal these things are the servants and prophets of the Lord who have held the keys of various dispensations of the gos-pel in the different thousand years,since the creation, from the first tothe seventh.Joseph Smith was a noble spirit in the presence of God thousands of years before he was born. The Lord has chosen other spirits whoare now among the Latter-day Saints who have hearts and souls that are inclined to truth and righteousness. The sisters have just as good a rightto smoke, chew, drink and get drunkas the brethren have. But the sis-ters never do these things. We will all have to keep the word of wisdomsooner or later. We are told by rev-elation that all the intelligence and truth we aquire during life will re-main with us in the resurrection.The world is against us. Our own nation is seeking to oppress us, and already a movement is afoot to in-duce the next Congress to pass strin-gent legislation to oppress us. It isour duty to pray daily to the Lordfor His power to be exercised in our behalf. I have faith in Zion. I sawit when it was small, and I have seen a little one became a thousand. I have faith our young people. Ibelieve they will keep the Word of Wisdom, and become a righteous na-tion.We are on the verge of greatchanges. There will be changes in Zion, in Jerusalem, in the UnitedStates and in all nations of theworld. If our young men want toknow what events await this genera-tion, let them read the revelation ofSt. John. The Lord showed to himmany things that will come to pass in this age of the world. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said itwas a correct doctrine that young menshould hold the priesthood when theytook the daughters of Zion to wife. Itwas their duty also to qualify them-selves to proclaim the gospel to theworld. Many had regretted their neg-ligence in this matter at home, when standing before assemblies of stran-gers abroad. The youth of Zion willhave to bear off this kingdom in themidst of the calamities and judgments that will vex the world. When theearth was fully ripe in wickedness theywould then be required to go forth and bind up the law and seal the testimonyto the nations of the earth. The pre-dictions of the servants of the Lordwould all be fulfilled, notwithstandingthe unbelief of this generation. Theprophecies of God's servants had been literally fulfilled in the past in the raising up of one nation and the overthrowof others, and in the destruction cities and kingdoms, and those yet tobe fulfilled would come to pass in thesame manner.President Woodruff again referred tothe necessity of the young men prepar-ing themselves for the work of theministry and narrated circumstancesthat transpired during his labor in that capacity. To this end it was not necessary for a man to have a collegiateeducation, but the Elders were to studythe principles of the Gospel, that atthe proper time the Holy Spirit mightselect from the knowledge they hadstored up, such things as would dogood when spoken. In this respect theElders were totally unlike the priestsof the day. God always backed up thetestimonies of his servants. The fieldwas large and the laborers few and the Lord wanted the young to qualifythemselves to gather out the wheatfrom the tares.

Co.,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Sir:Find enclosed a proof of the biographical sketch we propose to use in the second (and last) volume of our Album of Prominent Bankers of Am-erica. Have the kindness to read the matter over carefully and note anycorrections or changes which you think should be made. If the sketch asit stands meets with your approval, mark it O K. In any event please re-turn it to us as soon as possible.As we intend to print only so many copies of the book as we canbe sure of selling, you are particularly requested to indicate whether youwill want more than one copy ofor yourself and one for the bank. To you,as a contributer to the book's contents, the price will be ten dollars, per copy, although the regular price is twenty-five dollars. Like the first volume (copy of index enclosed) the book we now are compiling will contain about five hundred portraits with appropriate sketches; these willoccupy over five hundred quarto pages, with gilt edges, bound in seal-skin, deeply embossed and lettered in gold. The artistic merit, and actual usefulness of the work for purposes of reference, identification, etc., will far exceed in value the amount we ask which, in fact, is just about what the books will cost us. As your action in the matter is very impor-tant to us, we hope to have a definite reply.With good wishes, we areYours very truly, The Financier Company. J. E. Scattergood.

We had been called upon to furnish a certainnumber of missionaries whiceh we have done and have a list of othersto chose from as they shall be wanted. The parents of Riley G. Clark Jr. some months ago were approached in relation to theirson being called on a mission and they expressed a desire that hebe given a chance to finish his education and then they wouldbe more than willing that he should be called to perform a miss-ion as he would then be better prepared and their request awasconsidered by the local authorities here and garanted.We have one missionary already in the field, WilliamKing, who has been called from the academy without our consentand we sdesire to know whether or not that is the order of thechurch, if it is not we enter a protest against the Faculty ofthe Academy saying who of our wards ans^d^ Stake shall be calledon missions.An early reply will greatly oblige,Your brother in the gospel,Jesse W.
