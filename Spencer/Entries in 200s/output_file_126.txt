 Southern part of the mission. The Fresno Republican, has published   three pieces for the Reverand Mr. Munn, against us, and two forom me,  in our favor; and I have answered his last piece but do not know   if they have published it as yet, if they do I will send you a copy.    Our relations with the Southern Pacific Company continue   to be of the most pleasant nature; their officers and Agents have   treated us all with the utmost kindness and courtesy and I have   this morning received from Mr. J. C. Stubsbs an annuel Pass for the   presant year good on all their reoads in this state and Oregon. They   have reardily issued a Pass for my wife and child when ever I have   desired it; and in one case where I appealred to them in a case of   extfream poverty they gave me half ^fare^ of their $30 rate, cfor a widdow  and five children from this city to Ogden.    The questiomn of Tracts still continues to be our great   drawback. We are now entirely out,and as a consequence th Elders   are largly curtailed ifn their labors. With the force of Elders we   now have we need at least 5000 a month which would be less than   xx00 100 per month for each Elder. When the elders are canvassing   from house ^to house^ they must have Tracts or their labors seem to be almost   in vain.    Open air meetings cannot now be sucsessfully held on account of   the weather so our presant mode of prosecuting our labors is visit-  ing investigators and canvassing from house to house, and we fully   expect that during the winter, byn this means we shall have the   pleasure of leading quite a number down ointo the water.    During the last month I have visited the Elders in Fresno,   Visalia, Santa Paula and Los Angeles aned as the season rolls on I   intend to visit all the Elders in the mission in their several   fields of labor and do all that I can to brace them up and aid and   encourage them in their labors.    A glorious future looms up before us. Opportunities are   opening up on every hand. A good class of people are coming into  the Church; and investigators are coming into the church becoming mo  more plentifull every day.    We know not whether we have risen to the standard requir-  ed, or accomplished the amount of work expected of us; but we feel gr  greatly encouraged by the brightening prospects before us. We take   delight in our labors, and we enter the new year with unbounded con-  fidence in the Lord that he will enable us to reap a rich harvest   of souls and bgather them into the fold as the year ninty eightrols  rolls arround.    We will receive with particular pleasure any instructions   that you may see fit to give in relation to our conduct and the   course you wish us to persue in directing the labors of the Elders   during the coming years.    The prayers of the Elders assend to the Almighty contin-  ually in behalf of our Grand old President, Brother Woodruff;    Your Brother in the Gospel  E. H. Nye 
 of that peculiar document a copy of which you sent me. I think that I   succeeded in showing him the ordaer of the Priesthood and that the   Lorld would appear to the communicate with his servant who stands at   the head of the Church directly, when he had occasion to do so, and   not with a lay member. I pointed toout to ^him^ the stamp of the cloven foot   all over his communication and I think that he is satisfied. He said   he was very glad that I had come and given him the necessary in-  struction.    I deeply regret dear Brother, the fact, that you have been troubl-  ed so much by people writing to you on these matters from this mis-  sion. We have a Sister in San Diego who seems to want something   that we are unable to give her; she has written you twice for more   light. I think we must be very close to the infernal regions out   here as many people declare to us that they get revelations and   visitations from the unseen at willL; nevertheless occasionally we   find some good honest souls who gladly listen to the truth.    The Elders at presant are all well and enjoying their   labors and the Sister missionaries so far as has developed are prov-  ing a great help in the work.    Please send me such suggestions or instructions as may   seem good to you and I will carry them out to the best of my ability.    And now Dear Brother; with a prayer for your welfare and   continued happiness and the prosperity of Zion, I remain,    Your Brother in the Gospel,   E. H. Nye    Excellent letter.    A good kind answer by Prest. Woodruff   or the Presidency would be a comfort   to bro. Nye. I know, nothing especially   to answer. J. F. S. 
 All through the country districts a free good wiill pre-  vails-with but feww exceptions. The people are willing to come outt  to our meetings and listen to the doctrines we teach and it seemas  to be only a question of time before many good people will come itn  to the Church.    I believe it would be a good plan to take a large Tent in  which to hold meetings and go through these country settlements,   stay a week or two at a time place. Take two or trhree Elders and   their wives who weare good singers, the singing is a great attractin  and would secure good audiences in every country district, this woud  give us an opertunity to rweach the people,and the preseance and in-  fluence of the Sisters would I believe ^have^ a most benificial effect wih  the people. pPlease siginify your approval, or other-wise, of such a measure.    Out-door Preaching is now being prosecuted with vigor in all the  towns and cities of the counties in wihich the Elders are laboring;  and it proves to be the most effectual way of reaching the people;  all the Elders are delighted with it and declare it to be the among  the most pleasant experiences of their missionary life, and the best  training that an elder can have.    Though I am stationed hewith head-quarters here in San Francis  co yet the courtesies extended tio me by the S/P.  Company enable met  to visvit the Elders in their several fields of labor and thus en-  courage and assist them in the actual work of preaching the gospel.    The financial assistance you so kindly sent us was I as-  sure you was gratef^u^lly received and the 'Baby' (Mission) thus as-  sisted tlo its feet, will, Ife I feel safe in asserting, soon be able  to stand alone-financially.    And now Dear Brother, trusting that the waty we are prose-  cuting our labors in this mission will receive the stamop of your  approval and that you will signify your wishes in regard to uour  future course should you desire any changes there-in, and with a pray  er to the aAlmighty for his deivine favors to rest continually upon  you and your fellow laborers in the work of the Lord,    I remain Obediently yours,  E. H. Nye    P.S. Please note the change in our address,   508 Fulton St.    If the Expense of providing and using a  tent can be met it would no doubt be  a good thing, & if thought best by the bretheren in   the mission it will be approved here. Good   letter. Advise no change. Exhort to go ahead.  J. F. S.

 915 Golden Gate Ave. San Francisco, Cala.  Feb. 28th, 1898.    pPresaidient Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother;    One of our investigators, a lady has applied for baptism;  but has confessed that she had an abortion commited upon herself   when she was foive or six months along in pregnancy. She was and is,   living with her husband at the time, and had two sons; a rupture   with her husband that seemed as though it would result in seperatino^n^  caused her to do as she did. She now feels keenly the enormity of   the sin she commited. What is our diuty? aAre we at liberty to bap-  tize her? May she come  into the fold? Her husband though not an in  investigator, is not opposed and would be willing that the wife should  be baptized. As the element of doubt enters into my soul, as tho the   right course to persue in the matter, I humble seek for instructiosn    Praying for special blessings upon you in your high call-  ing, I remain, your Brother in the Lord;    E.

 -:CALIFORNIA MISSION:-  508 Fulton St. San Francisco, Calif.  May, 31st, 1897.    President Wilford Woodruff,   Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother;    Here with I send you material that I have prepared for a  Tract subject to your approval. The Tracts we now have in this missn  sion are unsatisfactory, and if this meets your approval I should   like very much to have the privelege of getting it published, as I  think it will be suitable for our work in this mission.    Our Tracts obtained from Chattanooga, cost us 60 cents  per 100 ^delivered here^ and when we send them out to the Elders in small quantities  there is another 18 cents added for stamps per each 100 this brings  them rather high, whereas if we could have a good supply on hand  when an Elder goes out to his field of labor he could take with  him sufficient to last his district for some time and this would  cut off as time rolls on, quite an amount fthrat we now pay out for  stamps. I understand that the Tracts cost in Chattanooga 42 cents  per 100. We have an offer from a reliable firm to publish the Tract,  if we give an order forr 40,000 the price to be $145.50. As this w  will bring the tTracts down to a fraction over 36 cents per 100, and  by haveing a good supply on hand ^will^ enable us to send them out with  the Elders when they go to their several fields, in many cases enou-  gh to last them till they return. By this means we can furnish  twice the amount of reading matter for what our Tracts now cost us.  And thus scatter the writen word more freely. The 40,000 Tracts  will not be more than enough for six or eight months supply, at the  rate we need to use them and arfter that a better price can be obtai-  ned as the price above includes the stereotype.    Should you approve of the Tract, and of the matter of  getting them published here, please return me the coppy. If in your   judgement you think it can be improved by adding to, in any partic-  ular part, or by cutting out any thing that is objectionable, please  signify your wishes in the matter. I designed to have the articles  of faith added, and if you could send me a plate of the Temple to  place the picture of that noble edifice on the outer leaf I think i  it would lend an added interest to the Tract.    The San Francisco Call, has just published tte the out-  line of a semrmon that I delivered last night, They also mailed free  to our friends, mostly in Utah, about 120 coppies of the paper. I had  a coppy sent toeach of the Presidency, They sent their artist to  take my picture as it appears in the paper.    Ever praying for the blessing of heave to rest in rich  abundance upon you and your associates, I remain,    Very truly yours,  E. H. Nye

 CALIFORNIA MISSION.    915 Golden Gate Ave. San Francisco, Calif.    March 7th, 1898.    President Wilford Woodruff,   Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother;    The work of the Lord in this mission is still rolling on and   the word from all parts is encouraging.    Since my last report I have visited all through the   Southern part of the mission and I am pleased to be able to stabte  that our affairs are in a most prosperous condition at that end.    I have visited Apostle Young at Pacific Grove and by his sug-  gestions and wise counsels I feel greatly strengthened for the work   that lays before me.    In Oakland the out look is particularly bright, so much so   that we have deemed it wise to engage a Hall there and for plast   month it has been filled every sunday evening withe earnest seek-  ers after truth. The Elders there are well received and have all   that they can do in visiting those who are investigating the doctri  nes we teach.    We have engaged Halls in San Jose and Stockton as the   work in those places seemed to justify it and prospects are bright   for good work to be done there as the time rolls on.    In many parts of the mission there is a lively interest taken   in the work of the elders by the people and many are reading our   works and coming to our meetings: ist is true that in some local-  ities indifferance is manifested and the elders are not meeting   with as much sucsess as could be desired, but there is no active or   open opposition anywhere in the mission and the Elders are feeling   splendid in the good work.    As the spring and summer comes along quite a number of   our Elders will be entitled to release and we could use several mor  more than we now have to good advantage.    Several of the Elders desire that they may be permitted to   have their wives with them for the remainder of their mission, I   can appoint them to labor in cities where they can have the compan-  ionship of their wives and I believe that the Sisters would be a   great help to their husbands in the missionary work. If this seems   to you consistant, and meets with your approval; will you kindly sig-  nify to us your assent in this matter. The names and addresses of   the Sisters I enclose herewith.    I shall be gratified indeed to receive any instructions   that you may see fit to send me and will do my uttermost to carry   them out.    Ever praying for your wellfare and for the prosperity of Zion,   I remain, Your Brother in the Lord,  E. H. Nye 
 In the meridian of ^at the appointed^ time the Savior came and dwelt among the chil-  dren of men. Having been born in the stable, and cradled in the manger  the days and years of His childhood and youth were spent with His par-  ents in the ordinary walks and avocations of life. Though there were  some wonderful things occured in relation to His immaculate conception  and birth: Angelic choirs from the upper deep descended chanting glad  tidings of great joy, peace on earth, good will to man; Herod's cunning  plans were baffled; his boundless rage, his cruel edict, the death of  the innocents; Joseph's heavenly warning to flee to Egypt with the young  Child; his journey and return, his stay in Gallilee that the Scriptures  might be fulfilled "He shall be called a Nazerene" [##Matthew 2:23##] — all these dropped  out of the public mind, and as the years rolled by were forgotten and  lost except by His relatives and friends. As He sojourned among men  during the years of His youth and early manhood there was nothing in  His life to attract the attention of His fellows until He unostentatious-  ly walked down into the waters of the river Jordan and there was bap-  tized by John, and though the Holy Ghost descending from the upper deep  was seen, as Jesus walked out of the water, to rest upon Him in the form  of a dove, and a voice from heaven was heard to say "This is my beloved  Son in whom I am well pleased" yet men did not in Him recognize the Son  of God. [##Matthew 3:17##] Though He preached the Gospel of Repentance and Baptism for the  remission of sins, chose and ordained twelve Apostles and sent them  forth to preach, and went forth healing all manner of sickness and dire  disease Himself—causing. the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the lame to  walk and leap for joy, teaching as no other man had taught, healing as   no other man had healed, rebuking as no other had ever dared rebuke men  for the sins they daily committed, they rejected Him and condemned Him  to a cruel death, and though He rose again (which fact was noised abroad  so that all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were cognizant of it) yet they  could not see in Him the Savior of the world.    On the great day of Pentecost when there were gathered together de-  vout men of all the surrounding nations, "suddenly there came a sound  from heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, and it filled all the house  where they were sitting, and there appeared unto them cloven tongues  like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them (the Apostles) and they  were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues  as the Spirit gave them utterance" and the people of the multitude were  all amazed for they hqrd heard the wonderful works of God each in his  own tongue. [##Acts 2:2-4##] Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and  said unto them, "Ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be  this known unto you, and hearken to my words." Then, repeating the  words of the Prophet Joel, he showed to them that Christ should come,   and briefly sketching the history of His life, recounting His wonderful  works and noble deeds, showing forth the fact to the people that they  had by cruel hands put Him to death, thus crucifying the Lord of glory;   that in fulfillment of the Prophet's words, God had raised Him from the  dead; that on the third day He had been seen by the Apostles and many  others with whom He had conversed, "whereof we all are witnesses" [##Acts 2:32##] There-  fore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the

Elder ^(Miller)^ would like to have wife arrive   here about the 15th, of April.    Your Brother;   E. H. Nye    P. S.

 Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, He hath shed forth this which ye  now see and hear. Therefore let all the House of Israel know assuredly  that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord  and Christ". Now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts  and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles "Men and Brethren  what shall we do?" Not until this moment did they believe in Christ as  the Savior of the world. Though all His wonderful works had been per-  formed in their midst, yet not until the story of His life, His terrible  death, His glorious resurrection, and the wonderful out-pouring of the  Holy Ghost now so magnificently manifested before their eyes, did faith  spring forth in their hearts, and a desire to be partakers of the  heavenly gift caused them to plead with the Apostles, "Oh what shall we  do!" [##Acts 2:14-37##] This faith is the main-spring of all action, a mighty moving power.  By it Noah, Abraham and Moses performed their wonderful works; the chil-  dren of Israel passed through the Red Sea, the walls of Jerico fell, the  Harlot Rahab perished not; Gideon, Barak, David and others of the prop-  hets subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises and  stopped the mouths of lions. The Apostle Paul understood the wonderful  power of faith when he said, ##Hebrews 11:6|Heb. XI, 6th,## "But without faith it is im-  possible to please Him; for he that cometh to God must believe that He  is, and that He is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him." This  verse is self explanatory. If we did not know that God lives and will  reaward those that diligently seek Him, we would not seek Him at all.  The ##Hebrews 11:3|3rd verse## reads:"Through faith we understand that the worlds were  framed by the word of God." So then, not only could the wonderful works  before recounted be performed by the old worthies, but even worlds could  be framed when necessary through the faith that was in God who created  them. But will faith alone accomplish the salvation of the souls of  man? As opinions differ, and he who risks his soul's salvation upon the  uncertainties of men's opinions has but a vain hope of being led aright,  let the Scriptures answer the question. ##James 2:14-26|James 2nd ch. 14-26.## This de-  claration of the great Apostle seems to set at rest for all time the  theory that faith alone is sufficient to save mankind. In closing his  speech, he very forcibly states that "As the body without the spirit is  dead, so faith without works is dead also." Shall we not say then, that  works are necessary, and if so what are those works? Again let the  Scriptures tell the tale. ##Matthew 3:2|Math. 3, 2nd## "In those days came John the  Baptist—saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand."  Jesus came preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, (##Mark 1:15|Mark 1, 15th.##)  "And saying, the time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand;  repent ye, and believe the Gospel." ##Mark 6:12|Mark 6, 12th,## "And they (the Apostles)  went out, and preached that men whould repent." Jesus was evidently  determined that there should be no mistake upon this matter when He said,  (##Luke 13:3-5|Luke 13, 3-5##) "I tell you nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all like-  wise perish. Or those eighteen upon twhom the tower in Siloam fell and  slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwell at  Jerusalem? I tell you NAY; but except ye repent, ye shall all like-  wise perish." The word of the Lord to Israel in the days of Ezekiel was  equally positive. (##Ezekiel 18:30|Ezek. 18, 30th##) "Therefore I will judge you, Oh House  of Israel, everyone according to his ways, saith the Lord God. Repent

 one will have the audacity to assert that He who gave His life and shed  His blood that we may obtain eternal life, has not the right to estab-  lish the conditions upon which we may secure the benefits of that aton-  ing blood. His promise is plain, and in language unmistakable, "He that  believes and is baptized shall be saved" and let us not forget that  the declaration is equally positive that "He that believeth not shall  be damned." [##Mark 16:16##] Nor is John the Beloved less im^ex^plicit in his statement of  what the Savior said to Nicodemas (##John 3:5|John 3, 5th##) "Jesus answered, verily  verily I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit   he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God." Here is a declaration from  the great Master Himself that ought to be sufficient answer to all who  fondly imagine that they can find some other way. Again, there are  those who believe that if they live a life of honor and integrity among  men, and serve God according to the best light they have, that they will  be entitled to an inheritance in the Kingdom of God. To all such let  the Scriptures once more declare the fact. (##Acts 10:1-6|Acts 10, 1-6)##and 48th) "There  was a man in Cesarea called Cornelius, a Centurion of the band called  the Italion Band, a devout man and one that feared God with all his  house, which gave much alms to the people and prayed to God alway. He  saw in a vision, evidently about the ninth hour of the day, an Angel of  God coming in to him and saying unto him,—Cornelius; and when he looked  on him he was afraid and said,—What is it, Lord? and He said unto him  Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God; and  now send men to Joppa and call for one Simon whose sir name is Peter.  He lodgeth with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea-side. He  shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do." Ah! Cornelius, thou God-  fearing, alms-giving, prayerful man, there is something that you have  not done! Though your faith has reached unto heaven, and your prayers  have been heard and your alms-giving considered by the Almighty, yet  there is something that you have not done of such great importance that  the windows of heaven were opened and an angel sent forth unto you as a   messenger, to notify you of the fact. What is it, Cornelius? He sent  for Peter as he was commanded, and when Peter came, saw their faith and  heard their words and they believed on the Lord Jesus, "He command-  ed them to be baptized." [##Acts 10:48##] This is the door into the Kingdom of God.    Now there is a great diversity of opinion among men as to the grand  object for which Baptism was institutied; some believing that it should  be performed in the presence of a great number of people as a testimony  to them that the humble penitent has put on Christ; others again, claim-  ing that it is an "outward sign of an inward grace", and still others,  that it was intended as a witness before men of a "change of heart". Not  a word can be found in the Scriptures to support any of these positions,   but on the other hand, evidence abounds in the sacred Record to prove  that the ordinance of baptism was for the purpose of "washing away" and  "for the remission of sins". Let us take the testimony of ##Mark 1:4|Saint Mark 1,4;##  "John did pbaptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance  for the remission of sins;" of ##Luke 3:3|St. Luke 3, 3,## "And he came into all the  country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the re-  mission of sins;" ##Acts 2:38|Acts 2, 38,## "Then Peter said unto them, Repent and  be baptised, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the re-

 mission of sins." Also ##Acts 22:16|Acts 22, 16,## "And now why tarriest thou? Arise  and be baptized and wash away thy sins." Here the grand question arises  what does sin consist of? Is it not the violation of law or the break-  ing of a command, and is not the sin of ommission as great as the sin  of commission? Surely the commandment "Remember the Sabbath day to keep  it holy" is just as binding as the one that precedes it "Thou shalt not  take the name of the Lord they God in vain"; yet the failure to obey the  one would be the sin of ommission, while to break the other would be the  sin of commission. [##Exodus 20:7-8##] And are not the commandments issued by the Savior  and His Apostles as much the commands of God as those uttered forth from  the coloud-capped peak of Mount Sinai? And if so, a failure to comply  when "God commands all men everywhere to repent" as in ##Acts 22:16|Acts 22, 16,## or  where Peter commanded them to "repent and be baptized for the remission  of sins" as in ##Acts 2:38|Acts 2, 38,## brings us under the condemnation of a broken  law and adjudges us all as sinners before God.    Having now discovered the door of the straight and narrow way that  leads to eternal life, which is baptism, and the object of that baptism  that it is for the purpose of remitting or washing away our sins, it  now becomes particularly interesting to decide who are proper candidates  for baptism. Among the various sects and creeds of modern christendom  many believe in the practise of baptizing little children. We unhesi-  tateingly say without fear of successful contradiction, that no foundatio  or justification of such a practice can be found in the Scriptures.  It has been shown beyong question according to the Scriptures, that  baptism is for the remission of sins. Sin is the breaking of laws or  commands of God. The child, until it comes to the years of understand-  ing, is not able to comprehend law or understand the binding nature of  a command—to obey or disobey; hence it is irresponsible. For where  there is no comprehension there is no law; and where there is no law  there can be no sin; and where there is no sin, baptism is uncalled for  and out of place and is the direct violation of the commands of our Sav-  ior. For if by baptism one child who dies in its infancy may be ushered  into the arms of Jesus, and for the lack of baptism another child dying  in its infancy is forbidden His sacred presence, then are we not bereak-  ing His direct command where He said, as in ##Mark 10:13-15|St. Mark 10, 13-15## "And they  brought young children to Him that He sholuld touch them, and His discip-  les rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it He was much displeased, and  said unto them 'Suffer little children to come unto mMe and forbid them  not, for of such is the Kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whoso-  ever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, he shall   not enter therein. And He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon   them and blessed them." The testimony of St. Luke is almost identical.  It reads as follows (##Luke 18:15-17|Luke 18, 15-17##) "And they brought unto Him also,  infants that He should touch them, but when His disciples saw it they  rebuked them. But Jesus called them unto Him, and said, Suffer little  children to come unto Me, and forbid them not for of such is the King-  dom of God. Verily I say u)nto you, whosoever shall not receive the King-  dom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein." Clearly  then, baptism was never intended for little children, for baptism hav-  ing been instituted for the purpose of washing away sins, sins already  committed, and the child not having committed any, the ordinance would 
 not apply. But what is more important than all, he that believes in  and declares it necessary for the little child to be baptized, and bap-  tizes it, is committing a most grievous sin in the sight of God. For if  it were true, as claimed by many Christians, that the little infant that  dies without baptism is shut out from the presence of God, that hell is  paved with little unbaptized children, they are erecting a barrier to  those little infants in the form of the ordinance of baptism and "for-  bidding" all such to come unto Christ, thus breaking one of His most em-  phatic commands uttered when "He was much displeased" at what they were  doing and said, "Forbid them not, but suffer them to come unto Me." [##Mark 10:14##] The  little child is pure and innocent because it can commit no sin till it  comes to the years of accountability. Sin then conceives in its heart,   and as it grows in years Satan tempts it and it becomes sinful and wick-  ed, and the means provided by the Almighty to cleanse it and make it  again as pure and as innocent as it was in the beginning of its mortal  career, is the sacred ordinance of baptism. And thus may the repentant  sinner become like the example that Jesus set before them as shown by  ##Matthew 18:2-4|Mat. 18, 2-4##; "And Jesus called a little child unto Him and set him in  the midst of them and said, Verily I say unto you, except you be con-  verted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the king-  dom of heaven. Whosoever, therefore, shall humble himself as this little  child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven." Thus the little  child is given to us as a pattern of purity, a sample of innocence, by  the Savior Himself; and the bare theory of baptizing such little inno-  cents to wash away their sins, becomes revolting to the human mind when  considered under the light of reason, as the practice of it is an abom-  ination in the sight of God. So little children are not elegible to  baptism. This declaration stands out in bold relief when viewed in the  light of the following passages which plainly prove that all candidates  for the kingdom of God must be capable of being taught. (##Matthew 28:19-20|Nat. 28, 19-20##)  "Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of  the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to ob-  serve all things whatsoever I have commanded you." All must have suf-  ficient mental development to be capable of believing the doctrines  taught, as shown by the Savior's commandments, and ##Mark 16:16|Mark 16, 16##, "He that  believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not  shall be damned." "But when they believed Phillip preaching the things  concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were  baptized, both men and women." (##Acts 8:12|Acts 8, 12##) "And as they went on their  way they came unto a certain water, and the Eunuch said, See here is  water; what does hinder me to be baptized? and Phillip said, If thou  truly believest with all thine heart though mayest, and he answered and  said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." (##Acts 8:36-37|Acts 8, 36-7##)    A knowledge of the divine truths of revealed religion when once  impressed upon the heart, causes faith to spring forth in the soul, and  we reflect with admiration upon the life of Him whose wondrous love was  manifested towards us when He offered His life as a sacrifice for our  sins. And by comparison we realize our own unworthiness, that our feet  have strayed from the path of right and that we are steeped in iniquity.  With this conviction comes a resolution to turn, if possible, from our 
 wicked ways and walk in newness of life. This brings repentance, a for-  saking of sin, a reverence for Almighty God and an earnest desire to  search after and serve Him in spirit and in truth. We resolve to tread  the path our Savior walked, down into the waters of baptism, thus follow  ing Him down through the door into the Kingdom of God, that where He is  we may be also. Sufficient mental capacity to be taught, to believe,  to repent and to voluntarily offer ones self for obedience to the suc-  ceeding principle of the Gospel are prerequisites to the ordinance of  baptism. Little children cannot do these things, consequently there is  no law of God requiring them to be baptised; and all man-made systems  to the contrary will be null and void in the day of judgment.    MODE OF BAPTISM.    As there are so ma^n^y conflicting opinions on this question; the  orthodox Christian churches having departed from the faith of the  Apostles, and built up churches to themselves for the purpose of making  merchandise of the souls of men, have instituted the practice of sprin-  kling and pouring &c. and call it baptism, to support which not one  word can be found in holy Writ. The whole sense of the ordinance of  baptism from the time that John the Baptist came preaching the baptism  of repentance for the remission of sins, on through all the writings of  the New Testament conclusively proves the fact that baptism by immers-  ion was the mode taught and practiced by Jesus and His Apostles. [##Matthew 3:1-2##] Jesus,   when He was baptized, "Went up straightway out of the water." [##Matthew 3:16##] When  Phillip baptized the Eunuch "They went down both into the water, both  Phillip and the Eunuch, and he baptized him, and when they were come up  out of the water, &c" [##Acts 8:38-39##] All this clearly indicates immersion, or why go  down into or come up out of the water? Paul says to the ##Romans 6:4|Romans 4, 4##;  "Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death" ##Romans 6:5|5th##, "For if  we have been planted together in the likeness of His death." Certainly  there is nothing in a sprinkling or a pouring that represents either a   burial or a planting, but each of these passages point in Unmistakable  terms to a baptism by immersion. The Apostle Paul again makes this clear  in his Episitle to the ##Colossians 2:12|Collosians 2, 12##; "Buried with Him in baptism  wherein also ye are risen with Him." When John baptized in the wilder-  ness "There went out unto him all the land of Judea and they of Jeru-  salem, and were all baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing  their sins." (##Mark 1:5|Mark 1, 5##)    All the evidence contained in the sacred Scriptures points unmis-  takably to the fact that immersion was the only mode of baptism practic-  ed by the Apostles and early Christians. Profane history gives con-  clusive evidence of this fact. Speaking of baptism in the first cen-  tury Dr. Mosheim says "In this century baptism was administered in con-  venient places without the public assemblies, and by immersing the can-  didate wholly in water." (Mosheim's Church History (Murdock) Third  Edition, Vol. 1, p. 87) Of the second century, the same great author  says: "Twice a year, namely at Easter and Whitsuntine, baptism was  administered by the Bishop or by the presbyters acting by his command  and authority. The candidates for it were immersed wholly in water with  the invocation of the sacred Trinity, according to the Savior's precept."    Indeed, the first deviation from baptizing by immersion occurs in  a case recorded by Eusebius, as happening in the third century. He alludes 
 to it in these detracting terms: "He (Novatian) fell into a griev-  ous distemper, and it beigng supposed that he would die immediately he  received baptism (being sprinkled with water) on the bed where he lay,  (if that can be termed baptism) neither when he had escaped that sick-  ness, did he afterwards receive the other things which the canon of the  Church enjoined should be received." (Ecclesiastical History, (Eusebius)  p. 113) Even down to the close of the thirteenth century baptism by  immersion was the rule, and sprinkling and pouring the exception. Yet  the innovation thus made in the third century has worked its insiduous  way in the various divisions of Christianity until to-day a convert can  have any kind of baptism he may desire; thus have they departed from  the faith of the Apostles and are teaching for religion the commandments  of men, having "Transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken  the everlasting covenant," in fulfillment of the words of the Prophet  Isaiah. (Isaiah 24, 5)    GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST.    The next step in the regular order of initiation into the fold of  Christ is to secure the birth of the Spirit, or the baptism of the Holy  Ghost; this being essential to enable us to pursue an acceptable course  in the service of the Lord, that the Holy Ghost may be with us as an  abiding gift, as a light ^lamp^ to our feet and a light to our pathway through  life. The Lord in His wonderful plan for the salvation of the souls of  men has provided a way for the humble and penitent baptized believer to  secure this blessed gift. (Mark 1, 8) "I indeed have baptized you with  water, but He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost." (Acts 1, 5) "For  John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy  Ghost not many days hence." Behold the promise fulfilled. (Acts 2, 2-4)  "And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind  and it filled all the house where they were sitting, and there appeared  unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.  And then^y^ were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with  other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance." But this precious  gift was not to be given until after Jesus was glorified, as shown by  the following, (John 7, 39) "—for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, be-  cause that Jesus was not yet glorified."    On that great Penticostal day the Holy Ghost was given and a glor-  ious manifestation of heavenly light appeared sitting upon each of the  Apostles who had accompanied the Savior in all His travels and had wit-  nessed His wonderful works, and by His divine favor had been made par-  takers of His holy ministry. They now received the promised blessing  in rich abundance, and a way was provided by which they might transmit  it to others who would comply with the special requirements, as shown  by the following: (Acts 8, 17) "Then laid they their hands on them and  they received the Holy Ghost." Evidently the Holy Ghost came not as the  result of the baptism nor in answer to ^the^ prayer of the Apostles, but by  the laying on of their hands. Clearly showing that this was the mode the  Lord had provided by which the Holy Ghost should be conferred upon bap-  tized believers; this again is clearly set forth in Acts 19, 5-6 "When 
 they heard this they were baptized in thename of the Lord Jesus. And  when Paul had laid his hands on them the Holy Ghost came on them, and  they spake with tongues and prophesied.    The Blood of Christ.    We have now pointed out to the penitent believer the path that  leads to eternal life, the straight and narrow way, and carefull noted  the inscriptions along the line, down into the water through the door  into the kingdom of God. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance of  all sins, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, gift of the  Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands; this is the course marked out by  the Father to prepare His children to receive the benefits of the aton-  ing blood of Jesus Christ. Earthly things are typical of heavenly  things as set forth in the following (1 John 5, 7-8) "For there are  three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy  Ghost, and these three are one; and there are three that bear witness  in the earth, the Spirit, the water and the blood, and these three agree  in one." By the water we keep the commandment, by the spirit are we  justified and by the blood are we sanctified; and thus we become Saints.  He who has fully repented of his sins and been baptized for the remiss-  ion thereof, and received the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, may  then partake of the emblems of the Savior's flesh and blood; and in  that sacred ordinance eat and drink to His soul the benefits of that  atoning blood. And such have the promise of the Savior that they shall  never hunger or thirst. There is no other way provided on earth by  which mankind can secure the benefits of the aton)ing blood of Christ.    AUTHORITY.    Upon this question hinges the validity of all the acts of men.  Every officer of our Government must be elected or appointed according  to the mode established by the constitution of the United States, or   his official acts fall to the ground as null and void. The decisions  of the court involving the validity of titles to land or other great inter-  ests would be void if it could be shown that the judge rendering the  decision had not been elected or appointed legally. Every deed issued  by a Sheriff at a sherriff's sale of real estate would be void if it  could be shown that the sheriff was a usurper and not legally authorized  to officiate in the duties of the office. All naturalization papers  issued by a judge when it could be shown that he had never been elected  or appointed according to constitutional requirements, would by a legal  tribunal be declared worthless and the holder deprived of his citizen-  ship. In fact the question of authority to act in any of the affairs of  human life is so clearly understood by all persons of ordinary intell-  igence that time would seem to be wasted in discussing it; but not so  in questions involving the future of the human soul. In these sacred  and vastly more important matters upon which hang all our hopes of  eternal life, the average man seems willing to trust to the opinions of  a minister of some of the orthodox sects or to the wild vagaries of any  upstart who cries "Lo here is Christ," or "Lo he is there" without for  a single moment raising the question—Where is his authority to offic- 
 iate in the sacred ordinances of the Gospel of Christ? or to initiate  men into the kingdom of God? The average merchant in conducting his  regular business, when waited upon by one claiming to be an agent of a  manufacturer, places his order with that agent fully expecting to re-  ceive the goods. As the time rolls on the goods come according. to the  sample shown and the order given. This fact alone is proof to the mer-  chant that the agent was in touch with his principal and was a duly  authorized agent. But if the good^s^ come not, it is strogng presumptive  evidence that the agent was a fraud and was not authorized by the manu-  facturer to take orders for goods. If this test be applied to the  ministers of the various sects of the Christian world it will at once  be found that they are self-appointed agents, not in touch with the  principal whom they claim to represent, as their patrons receive not  the goods. In other words the signs and wonders promised by the Savior  are lacking and do not follow the believer, which alone is sufficient  evidence that the so-called ministers are never sent of God. Jesus said  "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature, he  that believeth and is baptized shall be saeved, but he that believeth  not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe;  in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;  they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it  shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall re-  cover." These signs though forming one of the most prominent features  of the Gospel in the days of the Apostles are not to be found in any of  the contending sects of modern Christendom. Such as hunger and thirst  after righteousness become members of the various churches and humbly  bow at their sanctuaries, believing the doctrines there taught. Hunger-i  ly they seek food for their souls; thirstily they come, like sheep, to   the fountain, only to fingd that the storehouse is empty, the fountain  is dry. The promised blessigsngs fail, the signs do not follow, they re-  ceive not the goods. The grand secret of it all is, God has not sent  the agents through whom they seek these blessings; they hold no author-  ity to officiate in the ordinances of His house. As agents they are  not in touch with their Principal. These ministers are self-appointed  teachers of man-made systems of religion, they are teaching for doctrine  the commandments of men.    From the time the Christian Fathers fell by persecution, death or  controversy, from their original faith down to the time of the Emperior  Constantine made the catholic faith universal through the Roman pro-  vinces in the ^year^ 323 A D, the forms of the Christian religion were con-  statntly undergoing a change. At that time there were incorporated in  the Christian Church, heathen rites, which with the innovation added  down through the ages to the present time, stamps that church to-day  as one entirely separate and apart from the original apostolic Church.  Without Apostles and Prophets through whom they might obtain the word  of God, the Church has steadily drifted from its moorings unto ^onto^ the  broad sea of men's opinions till it is split and divided into hundreds  of different sects and creeds, no one of which can present an organ-  ization to-day that even resembles the form of the Church of Christ. The 
 most important features have been eliminated. Signs and wonders and  miraculous gifts, together with the fruits of the Spirit, set forth by  the Apostle Paul in ##1 Corinthians 12|first Cor. 12th## have disappeared, and but the empty  powerless form is found to-day among the children of men. The shadow  alone remains; the substance has departed. And why? Because mankind  have departed from the faith of the ancients. The rights, powers and  privileges of the Apostolic Priesthood have long since been withdrawn  from man, and all who officiate in religious rites do so without auth-  ority from the living God.    If we examine and see how the servants of God were called to the  ministry in other ages we can discover a guide to direct us in obtain-  ing authority in this age. Moses was called from out the burning bush  by God Himself (##Exodus 3|Ex. 3##) and when he was about to be succeeded by Joshua  as leader, Hhe conferred upon Joshua the holy priesthood by the laying  on of his hands. (See ##Deuteronomy 34:9|Deut. 34, 9##) "And Joshua, the son of Nun was full  of the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his hands upon him." Jesus  when He entered upon His ministry, called twelve and ordained them, viz;  "And He ordained twelve that they should be with Him and that He might  send them forth to preach." (##Mark 3:14|Mark 3, 14##) Again He says "Ye have ^not^ chosen  Me but I have chosen you and ordained you." (##John 15:16|John 15, 16##). Jesus said  in His prayer unto His Father, "As Thou hast sent Me into the world even  so have I also sent them into the world." (##John 17:18|John 17, 18##). The Apostle  Paul evidently had this question of authority to meet, as he gave vent  to his feelings in the following forcible language, "Whereunto I am or-  dained a preacher and an Apostle (I speak the truth in Christ and lie  not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity." (##1 Timothy 2:7|I Tim. 2, 7##). It  was very gratifying no doubt to the Apostle Paul to be able to declare  with such emphasis the fact of his ordination, and no wonder when we  consider the way in which he was called. He was justly entitled to de-  clare it, as will be seen by the manner of his calling. "As they minis-  tered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Ghost said: Separate me Barnabus  and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had  fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away, so  they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, &c" (##Acts 13:2-4|Acts 13, 2-4##) Paul then  was evidently called by direct revelation of the Holy Ghost, and when  the hands of the Prophets were laid upon him, he was sent away, as also  was his companion Barnabus.    The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews makes a most positive de-  claration on this question. He says: "For every High Priest taken from  among men is ordained for men, in things pertaining to God that he may  offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; And no man taketh this  honor to himself, but he that is called of God as was Aaron." (##Hebrews 5:1-4|Heb. 5,4##) 
 A glance at ##Exodus 4:14-16|Exodus 4, 14-16 and 27-28## will show us how Aaron was called:  "And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and Hs said, Is n  not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well, and  also behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and when he seeth thee he will  be glad in his heart. And thou shalt speak unto him and put words in  his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will  teach you what ye shall do; and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people"  Thus Aaron was called of God; and in all ages when God has had a people  on the earth, His servants have been duly called of Him and ordained,  and the stamp of His approval has been placed on their labors in signs  and wonders and miraculous manifestations.    LACK OF AUTHORITY.    Not only are the Scriptures teeming with evidence that the servants  of God were duly authorized, call ed and ordained, to officiate in the  ordinances of His house in all ages of which the Bible gives us any ac-  count, but the fact stands out in bold relief, that in every instance  where men dared to act without authority the Lord manifested His dis-  pleasure in a just rebuke for their presumption; as in the case of  King Saul recorded in ##1 Samuel 13:8-14|I Sam, 13, 8-13##: "And he tarried seven days ac-  cording to the set time that Samuel had appointed, but Samuel came not  to Gilgal and the people were scattered from him. And Saul said, Bring  hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings. And he offered the  burnt offering. And it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end  of offering the burnt offering, behold Samuel came; and Saul went out  to meet him. And Samuel said What hast thou done? and Saul said Be-  cause I sawst that the people were scattered from me and that thou  camest not within the days appointed, and that the Phillistines gathered  themselves together at Michmash; therefore said I: The Phillistines will  come down now upon me to Gilgal and I have not made supplication unto  the Lord; I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering. And  Samuel said to Saul: Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the  commandment of the Lord thy God which He commanded thee; for now would  the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever, but now thy  kingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought Him a man after His  own heart and the Lord hath commanded him to be Captain over His people  because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee." And thus  he lost his kingdom and his life through daring to officiate in the  priest's office without authority. Nor did Uzziah, king of Judah re-  ceive any better recognition, for though he had gained the favor of  heaven in his earlier days through obedience to the commands of God,  yet in after years when proud and haughty and flushed with victory, he  essayed to officiate in the Priest's office, as shown in the following:  "But when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction, for  he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple of  the Lord to burn incense upon the alter of incense. And Azariah, the  priest went in after him and with him four score priests of the Lord that  were valiant men. And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto  him: It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, 
 but to the priests, the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn in-  cense. Go out of the sanctuary for though hast trespassed; neither shall  it be for thine honor from the Lord God. Then Uzziah was wroth and had  a censor in his hand to burn incense. And while he was wroth with the  priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in  the house of the Lord, from beside the incense altar. And Azariah the  chief priest and all the priests looked upon him, and behold he was  leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence, yea, him-  self hasted also to go out because the Lord had smitten him. And Uzziah  the King was a leper unto the day of his death." [##2 Chronicles 26:16-21##] Such a terrible  penalty, it would seem, should have been a warning to all succeeding  generations to refrain from interfering with sacred things without  authority. But another single instance is recorded before God gave them  up to a reprobate mind, and this was during the days of the Apostles, and  is contained in the following quotation: "Then certain of the vagabond  Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits  the name of the Lord Jesus, saying; We abjure you by Jesus whom Paul  preacheth. And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew and chief of  the priests, who did so. And the evil spirit answered and said; Jesus  I know and Paul I know, but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil  spirit was, leaped on them and prevailed against them, so that they fled  out of that house, naked and wounded. And this was known to all the  Jews and Greeks also, dwelling at Ephesus, andfear fell on them all,  and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified." [##Acts 19:13-17##]    It would seem that the Christian world have learned a lesson from  the reading of the foregoing passages, as they no longer attempt to  cast out devils or heal the sick by the laying on of hands in the name  of Jesus, knowing only too well that they have no authority to do so,  and fearing the consequences as dire to themselves, either by receiving  such punishment as was meted out to the sons of Sceva or by thus reveal-  ing the fact that they were unauthorized of God, expose themselves to  the just resentment of their deceived and misguided followers.    SALVATION FOR THE DEAD.    In this age of religious freedom when every man is at liberty to  worship how, where or what he pleases, when the Christian Church is  split and divided into innumerable sects and creedsand is still divid-  ing and subdividing; where the opinions of men, crystalized into creeds,  pass current as systems of theological truths; while spiritualism in all  its various forms is rampant upon the earth, and its younger and more  delicately molded brother, theosophy, is just bursting forth as a  wonderful revelation from the unseen world, while darkness covers the  eatrth and gross darkness the people, and the men are continually seek-  ing for that which borders upon the sensational, the word of God comes  forth proclaiming the principles of salvation for the dead as well as   for the living. That there is but one faith, one hope, one baptism, one  way to obtain eternal life, either for the living or for the dead, is  clearly shown by the Scriptures. "To the law and to the testimony; if  they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light  in them." (##Isaiah 8|Isaiah 8##, ##Isaiah 20|20##). This shall be our guide, by this divine 
 method we are willing that all might be judged. Opinuions of men are  not the words of God, nor is the word of God to receive a private inter-  pretation as is clearly shown by the following: "Knowing this first  that no prophecy of the Scriptures is of any private interpretation.  For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men  of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." [##2 Peter 1:20-21##] Opinions of men  shall not then prevail, but we will take the word of God for our gGuide,  "And when they shall say unto you, seek unto them that have familiar  spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter, should not a people  seek unto their God for the living to the dead?" (##Isaiah 8:19|Isa. 8, 19##) Let us  to the Scriptures then, and seek the word of God for a knowledge of the   dead.    After Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, fulfilled His mission  among the living and was about to depart to the unseen world and per-  form his work for the salvation of the dead; while he was suffering the  pangs of death upon the cross between two malefactors, he was railed  upon by one, yet worshiped by the other, to whom He said: "To-day shalt  thou be with Me in Paradise. [##Luke 23:43##] This saying has created a belief in the  Christian world that the vilest sinner on his death-bed or the murderer  upon the gallows by confessing Christ at the alast moment can be saved.  But let us find out what became of the thief. Where did he go? To  heaven? Not if the Scriptures are true. On the morning of the Savior's  resurrection and Mary's visit to the sepulcher, she thought Jesus to be  the gardener. Yet when He said "Mary" she at once recognized Him and   in her joy evidently sought to embrace Him, for it is said, "Jesus saith  unto her: touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go  to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your  Father and to my God and your God." (##John 20:17|John 20, 17##) If this be true, aare  we not justified in asking the question, "Lord, if thou hast not been  to they Father and God during those three days, where has though been,  and where didst thou take that thief?" Let the Scriptures answer. Men's   opinions are worthless on such vital questions. "For Christ also hath  once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us  to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit  by which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison, which  sometime were disobedient when once the long suffering of Noah God  waited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing, wherein few,  that is, eight souls were saved by water." (##1 Peter 3:18-20|I Peter 3, 18-20##) So then  Christ took the thief to the spirit world and there undoubtedly  preached the Gospel to him in connection with Noah's people. And why?  "For for this cause was the Gospel preached to them that are dead, that  they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according  to God in the Spirit." [##1 Peter 4:6##] It would seem that this can need no explanation  for by this rule all men are to be judged by the same law, whether they  hear the Gospel in life or after death. And herein is the justice of  Almighty God made manifest, for if it were not so, and if the modern  Christianity theory should prevail, viz.—that all mankind who do not  confess Christ are lost—what shall be said of four-fifths of the  people on the earth to-day, and those that have lived in like circum-  stances in the heathen world, who never heard of Christ? If, when all  mankind are brought before the judgment-seat to be judged, and the  heathen hears his sentence read by the 
 great Judge, "Depart from Me, ye cursed, into the place prepared for  the devil and his angels, because you never confessed My name." [##Matthew 25:41##] Would  not that heathen be justified in saying, "Who are thou? I never heard  of Jesus Christ. When I was on the earth I worshipped Joss and served  him faithfully." To punish the heathen for not confessing Christ when  in fact he had never heard of him, is contrary to the justice of an all-  wise Creator. But God has provided a better way. All who have never  heard the Gospel in life will have an opportunity after death, as  clearly set forth in the above as in the following: "Verily, verily I  say unto you, the hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear  the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live." [##John 5:25##]  "But,"  says the objector, "that means all they that are dead in sin," but read  a little farther: "Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in the  which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice." (##John 5:28|John 5, 25 and  28##) Again, "For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's  belly, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the   heart of the earth." (##Matthew 12:40|Mat. 12, 40##). By these passages it is clearly  apparent that the Savior fore-knew His mission to the spirit world in  the heart of the earth, and that while there, all who were in their  graves would hear His voice. Not only was this understood by Jesus and  His Apostles, but long prior to the Savior's day, the Prophets foresaw  the work He would do for the dead, viz: "I the Lord have called thee  in righteousness, and will hold thine hand and will keep thee, and give  thee for a covenant toof the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to open  the blind eyes, to bring out the 7 prisoners from the prison, and them  that sit in darkness out of the prison house." (##Isaiah:42:6-7|Isaiah 42, 6-7##). Here  the prophet foretold the labors of the Savior. During His sojourn in  the flesh, we have no account of His having brought out the prisoners  from the prison, or proclaiming liberty to the captives, or the opening   of the prison to them that are bound. Had hHe done so, the Roman Gov-  ernment would have had a case against Him, yet Pilate found no fault in  Him. Hence we must look elsewhere for the fulfillment of these pass-  ages. "And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall punish  the host of the high ones that are on high and the kings of the earth  upon the earth, and they shall be gathered together as prisoners are  gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison and after many  days shall they be visited." (##Isaiah 26:21-22|Isaiah 26, 21-2##). Here is the final of a  terrible picture of the earth's desolation, when it is to be empty,  turned up-side-down, broken, dissolved, removed like a cottage, and the  inhabitants thereof scattered. All are to be gathered, including the  kings and the high ones, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, shut up  in prison and after many days visited. What will be the object of this  visitation? Peter has already told it, as Christ visited the antide-  luvians, so when these have suffered the vengeance of almighty God in  the spirit ^world,^ some of His servants, ministering angels, will be sent to  visit them and preach the Gospel to them as Jesus did. "lift ^up^ your  heads, Oh ye gates, and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and the  King of glory shall come in. Who is this king of glory? The Lord strong 
 and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle." (Psalm 24, 7-8). What was  the subject of the vision thus portrayed by the prophet and where was  it to take place? He saw the Savior making His triumpjhial entry into  the infernal regions, and with irresistable power the gates and doors  are made to fly open, and the immortal King stands in the midst of the  prisoners of the spirit world. Thus the full import of that beautiful  passage of the psalmist David would read: List up your heads, oh ye  gates of hell, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors of the prisons  of the damned, and the King of glory shall come in, to the regions of  darkness proclaiming liberty to the captives and the opening of the  prison doors to them that are bound in hell. If the antideluvians after  their long sojourn in the regions of darkness were had in remembrance  before God so that He sent His beloved Son to preach to them the Gospel  during the time His body lay in the tomb, what shall be done for those  who have died since the Savior's visit to the spirit world? As His  Apostles and all His faithful followers served Him in life, who shall  saty that after death they will not follow His example, and continue to  serve Him by going to the spirit world and there preaching to the  spirits in prison who have died without a knowledge of the Gospel? And  when these poor benighted beings after their long captivity under the  reign of Lucifer, listen to the precious truths of the Gospel of Christ  and become converted, straightway the question arises, How can I obey  the ordinances of baptism? I am in a disembodied state of existence,  yet my Savior has said: "Except ye are born of the water and of the  spirit ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of God." Oh wonderful plan  provided by the Almighty! The living may be baptized for the dead. It  is very plain that this great principle was understood by the ancient  Saints as will be seen by the words of the Apostle Paul addressed to  the Corinthians: "Else what shall they do which are baptized for the  dead if the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for the  dead?" (I Cor. 15, 29)

 OFFICE OF   The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ   of   Latter-day Saints    P.O. Box. B.    Salt Lake City, Utah.    May 1, 1891.    President L. W. Shurtliff,  C. H. Middleton and N. C. Flygare.    Dear Brethren:    The case that is now pending either before the High Council or Bishop's  Court in which Elders Job Pingree and Nathan Tanner, jr. are parties, has been brough[t]  to our attention. A copy of the resolution adopted by the High Council, and by which   these parties were suspended from the privileges of the priesthood, and to a certain  extent from membership in the church, has also been submitted to us. By this action  these brethren are practically disfellowshipped; and Brother Nathan Tanner, jr. feels  very deeply the serious consequences which attend the adoption of this resolution,  and has appealed to us for relief. We do not know what reasons you had for taking   this action previous to the hearing of the case, but naturally suppose you must have  had good reasons or you would not have adopted a resolution that is so unusual if no[t]  extraordinary; but whatever reasons may be we think immediate steps should be taken [to]  have the case tried and some decision reached concerning it so that these brethren  may not be kept  in a position so exceedingly unpleasant to every one who values his   standing in the church and in the priesthood. It may be that the parties themselves  are to blame for the delay; if they are they should be urged to take immediate action.  If the delay be due to either of the tribunals, then we suggest that no time be lost  in giving the case a hearing, as the passing of the resolution adopted by the council   was three months ago. With kind regasrds,    Your brethren,    W Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith 
 Elder Woodruff made a few remarks, he said that the  scripture doctrine was now reversed, where it said that a prophet  was not without honor save in own Country, for the whole nation  with the world to back them had risen up for the destruction of our  leaders and to break up this Church and Kingdom. He felt that  he would like to have some Angels or personages sent to occupy  this Hall and the buildings in this City and throughout this  Territory dedicated to the Lord, so that if our enemies came here  to desecrate our habitations and our public buildings the Angels  of the Almighty might be here to trouble them. He believed in the   principle of dedicating this Hall to God. He felt that he wanted  to dedicate his house and to pray that he might get the Holy   Ghost upon him to such a degree that every ungodly man who  should enter might be troubled. We have built and planted  and occupied our possessions a considerable time in peace in these  Valleys and his prayer was that the Lord might bless us and  give continually his Holy Spirit, that we may learn to appreciate  our blessings and privileges, and that we may so close to God  as to realize that we are his friends, and though this people may  be called to pass through straight places he was satisfied that it  it was for the purpose of becoming more acquainted with the  laws of God; to secure our salvation and exaltation; to open  the way for the spread of the Gospel and the extension of the King  and he felt that it was all right. This is a good room and is  built with taste and at considerable expense, and if we do  not occupy it we shall get a reward, and somebody has got  to pay for these things; he believed it will cost a greater bill  before we get through with it, and he felt satisfied that this  very room will be one means of ripening the world for the harves[t]  We have heretofore had towns, hamlets, cities counties and  States to rise up against us, but never before had to stem thi[s]  tide of the persecution of a whole nation. but our course is  onward and we shall prevail over the combined powers of   earth and hell, he was satisfied of this and he prayed that  we might take hold of it like good soldiers. 
 [in sideways text]  Notice sent to  the Temple  [end of sideways text]    205 11th Street  San Francisco  Sept. 3[r]d 1894    President Wilford Woodruff;    Dear Bro.  It is with much sorrow that  I inform you that Bro. Henry  S. Tanner, President of the  California Mission, is very  ill with a fever.  The symptom  is that of malaria. He has  been feeling quite miserable  most of the time since he arrived  here.  He is bed fast at present.  He wishes to be prayed for in  the Temple;  Your brother and  colaborer in the Gospel of Christ.    Henry B. Williams  traveling Elder.    Sorry. 
 Henry B. Williams  Sept. 3 [18]94. 
 What can we do   for bro. Tanner?  J. F. S.    205-11th Street.  San Francisco   Sept. 5th 1894    President Wilford Woodruff;    Dear Brother;  I am pleased to be able to inform you that President   Henry S. Tanner seems a little   improved in health, since I   wrote you on the 3rd inst. But   he is very ill yet. The saints   and I are doing the best we   can for him. He is bed fast   yet. I will write again soon.    Your brother in the Gospel  H. B. Williams    P. S. There is a young man here from Ogden   studying medicine. He is giving what   aid he can in the way of medicine. 
 118-10th St.,  San Francisco, Cal., Dec 1 [18]94.    Prest. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    Replying to your recent   favors—I can say that I have found a   wholesale establishment where I can get   our Mission cards printed at the rates of   $1.00 per thousand in ten thousand lots, which   is nearly as cheap again as you can have them done there, three times as cheap as   we got our others printed for—which was $3.00  per thousand.    I am satisfied with the answer you   gave about colonizing California.    I am also willing to be as economical   as possible in the mission for I realize   the stringency in money matters, but if we   are successful here, we will have to have means  until we get a thorough foot-hold.  The mission   is at a very low ebb and it will take a superior  power to raise it, but if we are successful here  we will have to shape circumstances and not   let circumstances shape us, for this people

 will not put themselves out in any   respect for religion.  The work is new here   and all of the powers are arrayed against   it and unless we have aid until we have   become self sustaining, we will be a   long time making a little show.  This is   a large city and much advertising will  have to be done to ge the Gospel before   the people.  If we fail to reach the people  and make their food pallitable, we will not   be remembered for our successes.  We feel  sure of prosperity in this mission, for I believe   that the harvest here is ripe, but owing to the   natures of the elements which surround us   here, we will have to have men and machinery   to save the grain.  I thoroughly believe that   this mission will become self sustaining but it   may be some time.  I also believe that the means   spent here will be a rich investment, and after   a few days will return with an abundant   increase.  I will write to my quorum and see   if they can raise us some means to advertise   with, for much of our success will depend upon   our advertising. 
 Address 29 -- 11th St.    San Francisco, Cal. Aug 16 [18]94.    To 1st Presidency    Deat Brethren:    I arrive in  San Francisco yesterday noon and found  the Brethren glad to see me.  Had most  anything but a pleasant trip -- it was so very   warm and dirty.    It will take something superior to man's  power to reach this people, apparently religion  is all a dream to them.    I will be glad to recieve any instuctions  you feel like I need, but chances here  look quite slim to me -- in some repects;  but can tell better when I investigate more.    The Bretheren join me in love to you  and in praying the Lord to continue to bless  you    Your Brother in the Gospel  H. S. Tanner. 
 How soon will Elder Jos. R. Shepherd reach us?  I am very glad you expressed your willingness   for my wife to remain with me for I believe she   will be able to do much good.    I will send you a statement of my expenditures   since Oct 27th.                 Rent for November $15.00      Board 18.75      Laundry and Clothing 4.90      Stationery 3.60      R.R. Fair 3.55      Drayage 1.00      Total $46.80       I will have to pay my December rent in a week   or so.  I hope this account will give satisfaction, it seems   large but I don't know how to lessen it and to do justice to my   work.  I want to make this mission a success and   will do all in my power to get the Gospel before the   people.  Much of our work at present is in removing   prejudice.    Please make another appropriation to the mission.    I trust in the Lord blessing all those who are   laboring in the cause of truth.  Your Brother   H. S. Tanner.  See over. 
 118-10th St., San Francisco, Cal. Nov. 19 [18]94.    First Presidency of Church of Jesus Christ of L.D.S.  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brethren:    Your favor of 15th inst. at hand.  Elder John Mc Donald reached here in due time. I  wish there were some more of such men to come  and labor among their relatives if only for a few months.  Yes! I have moved to the address of 118-10th St. While  we held services on 29-11th St, a family of people  had to live in the rooms below to reduce the rent, and  we roomed there ^with Bro. Mortensen^. When we changed our place ofor  holding services—we had to move. We have two rooms  at the present, on the second floor. A front room which  we use for a bed-room and sleepingr sitting room, and  a back room which we use for a kitchen. They cost us  $15.00 a month. Any time Sister Tanner goes home  I can give up the kitchen, but a front room alone will cost  $12.00. I have been to a great many places that were for rent  and this is the best I could get. Rent seems very high.    I have tried to investigate the nature of things here  and I think we need women here as well as men.   If we could have a few ^worthy^ young men just married  or with a small family called and sent here to help us thoroughly 
 H. S. Tanner  Aug. 13 [18]94. 
 How will it do to settle upon some   stated amount pr month, say 35$ or   40$ and try to get it approved, and?  We shall then know what we will have to do.  J. F. S.    [sideways text] H. S. Tanner  Dec 1 [18]94[end of sideways text] 
 establish ourselves and make a solid foot hold here I   think it would be a very wise thing. There are young  men ^(with small families)^ in Utah, who could do much good here. If theyre could  be such called here, who are propessional men and locate  here for a time, we would do well. I feel that it would  be a wise thing to do, if we intend to locate permanently  in San Francisco. I am anxious to know if you  favor the idea. [Joseph Fielding Smith] ^I hardly think we can colonize Cal with missionary families at present.^    I would like my wife to remain with me a while if you  are willing, she is improving in health and I feel that it  will do her good. I also think that her influence and  labors among the sistes is for good. She can also  help me in many ways now that she is here; but if  you think she should return to her people, informe  me concerning the matter. She is desirous of  doing what is right and if you think we can do  better work by her returning she can go any time  now as my health is restored. ^I am willing his wife should remain if he desires it.^    The work here is beginning to look brighter—two applied  for baptism last night, a young man and his wife.    Please have a weekly news sent to C. J. Nethercott 1428 1/2  5th St. Oakland, Cal. Brother Nethercott has the spirit of  his work.    Please find inclosed 1/2 doz. of my Missionary cards.

 San Francisco. Aug 21 [18]94.  First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ   of L.D. Saints.    Dear Brethren:    I take another opportunity   of writing to you. Brother Williams   and myself will not be able to do much   until we get help. We want two Elders   here as soon as they can conveniently   come. You are acquainted with the   brazenness of this field of labor and the   nature of our work and the kind of men   we need—that is, men of patience,  stability, and experience.    Our prospects at the present are not   by any means flattering, and the only way   ^we^ will be able meet with success, is to put   on a force that will be able to dig deep   and pick out the few precious stones   that have sunk in the rubbish.    We are desirous of using every legitimate

I hope you will be able put your   hands on two Elders that can come right   out—we could put them to work to-morrow   if we had them.

The agent wants   something of this kind to keep in   his office for reference.    I hope you have received my letter   stating that we want two more Missionaries here   as soon as we can get them.    We had several strangers at our meeting   yesterday and last night.

 Liverpool.  May 10th, 1884.    President Wilford Woodruff,   Salt Lake City,  Utah.    Dear Brother:    Your very welcome of march 15th came safely to hand  so I wrote to you on the 20th of march, I have delayed answering you   until now, not having of interest to write. I am of the opinion   that the Legislature would have done well to have allowed the   Governors action to have killed the Appropriation bill and have thrown  the responsibility upon him. I was also hoping that some spirited   member would collect together a list of his infamous [s]ets both   of a private and public nature and in a speach upon the   floor of the house brand him as a villain, and club him with   his own vile record, and have the same go upon the record, it is   very likely however that memorial to Congress may answer every   purpose. I am pleased to hear that the Indians in the south are   taking hold on the Gospel, I trust that much good may come   of it. We are just informed by the papers today that Miss Emily   Faithfull is going to [lecture] against us in June, showing that   the Ladies in Utah are in most fearful slavery or bondage. 
 The papers also says that one of our brethren has been sentenced   to one months imprisonment at Viena for missionary work in that   country. We had learned some days ago that this would be the case   but Bro J. Q Cannon thought it would be for a much longer period    The Elders who left home on April 15th came safely and had   a very pleasant journey. Your son has been assigned to labor for   the present in the Manchester Conference under the Presidency   of Elder W D. Williams one of my most efficient Elders, I feel much   pleased with the spirit manifested by him and the other young   brethren. I feel certain that they will do much good just as soon   as they get at work and fully interested. The spring has been   cold and windy with but little rain, we could not hold outdoor   meetings without endangering the health of the brethren.    Tomorrow I attend meeting at Lowestoft the most easterly point   of England and the former home of father Neslin, he built a   small chapel for the saints there, but it has passed out of their   hands. I must be off. We held a meeting in Shield Park and a   few stopped and listened to us You will please give any kind   regards to Bros Richards, Jaques and Pratt and any other who   may enquire after me. Please remember me kindly to your   family. My wife and child are well.    With kind regard to you I am you brother in the Gospel.    John Henry Smith 
 ^Liverpool^  November 18th [188]4    President Wilford Woodruff   Salt Lake City    Dear Brother:    Your very welcome letter of September 23rd came safely   to hand, finding us on the enjoyment of good health and   spirits. We published the items in your letter, correcting  some errors, that had appeared in the article that you   wrote to us giving advice to young elders. I have not   written to you for some time, from the fact that I had [littl[e  of interest to communicate. Our missionary business  moves quietly along here in Great Brittain. Since the killing   of our brethren in Tennessee, the press of this country have   been publishing all manner of vile stories on in regard to us.   The P. P. Pratt and McLean affair, having figured prominently,   in the articles that have been written from some quarters  and garbled extracts from the Journal of discourses and   Millennial Star, have been brought forward to sustain   the charges made against us, and if possible to destroy   the little seed sown. Quite a number of parties are   also lecturing against us, among them Miss Emily   Faithful, who paid a visit to our City I think in 1883. 
 Salt Lake Septr 25 [18]86.    Prest. Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother:    Yesterday we  called upon Albert Carrington,  by request of Franklin D. Richards  and had some conversation with  him in regard to his case; he says  he is willing to do anything required  of him, if he can only be rebaptized.    We found him quite feable, being  just able to walk across the room,  he claims to have paid his tithing  and attended to his prayers  regularly, always remembering  his brethren, he harbors no  feelings against any one, and  bears his testimony to the truth  of the work, he will sign a  written complaint confession,  admitting that he was guilty of 
 She has taken up the Mountain Meadow business, the   Statements of Apostate mormon women and askes them up   and deals them out to the gaping crowd—her standing in   society gives some weight to her utterances. It is hardly   possible though for her to do us any particular injury, as her   stories are of the old class having been exploded a hundred   times. Another person by the name of Joseph Johnson is also   regaling the people on the Isle of Man with a series of   lectures in which he is retailing many things of a vile nature   calculated to have a detrimental effect to the word in that   part of the vineyard. He has secured quite a number of   items in regard to family matters in Utah, to which he has   added whatever the evil one might suggest to his mind,  and with these he hopes to block up our way entirely on the  little Isle. We have yet another, no less a person, than the   notorious William Jarman, "who by the way is not far removed   from insanity," he is travelling around the country, lecturing   and giving an exhibition of some pictures, representing   scenes as he claims have occured in the west. If I   remember correctly I sent you a copy of the book from which   he lectures, he takes particular pains to go wherever we have   a branch of the church, rent a Hall, challenge our Elders to   meet him, and whether they go or not, he attends our meetings   on the sabbath day, listens quietly to what has been said till   the services are over, and then commences an harrangue to   the people, in which he uses such vile dirty language in   regard to the endowments, and other things held sacred by us,   that it is impossible for any one with any spirit to put apart   it. I have instructed the elders and saints to keep away from   his meetings, and that if he came to ours not to permit him   to enter our Halls. On the 14th I received the following.    John Henry Smith. Latter day devil Office, 42 Islington, Liverpool.   Shall be in Liverpool shortly, when I shall require you to meet   me in public debate, or prepare to leave Liverpool, for I shall   not rest, so long as a missionary from Salt Lake remains  in Great Britain; I want you to discuss mormon doctrine   and practice in Utah. you have my permanent address,   have you any more letters from my ex wife yet. Wm Jarman    This fiend seems to be fully infused in the work he has taken   in hand, and is laboring with satanic zeal, to excite the public   mind against us. I am of the opinion however, that he crushed   the mark so far, that no honest man can possible be deceived   by his stories. I am at the present time settling in my own   mind, what course to pursue in regard to sending an elder or two   to Constantinople, and have about reached the conclusion, to have 
 adultry and asking the people to  forgive him, he is not able, he says,  to go before the public.    Bro Grant cannot feel that  Albert Carrington is humble or that  he fully appreciates the the great  crime that he has committed,  Bro. Smith feels that he is as  humble as it is possible for him  to be with his organization, &  that his mind is too weak to  fully appreciate his condition    With kind love & ever praying  God to bless & preserve you, We are    Respectfully Your Brethren,    John Henry Smith  Heber J. Grant    P.S.  We feel that Albert Carrington  is gradually losing his mind 
 Bro Spori who speaks the English, French, and German I   beleive, go there. I feel impressed with the idea that some good   will be accomplished. I shall however be compelled to assist   him from this Office, as I am of the opinion he is unable to   help himself. I shall drop later in Italy for the present,   brother Andrew Villet spent a year there, and absolutely accom  plished nothing. The people of that land are being scourged   and it may be that after a time, some interest may be awakened.  France was also dead to all the efforts made by Bro Bunot  to get a foothold in that land. Brother Schoenfeld writes quite   hopeful in regard to Austria, and I have written to him to have   brother Beisinger make his way quickly again into that country   and see, wether is is possible it is possible to make an opening.   By letter from Elder Tanner from Berlin. I learn that there is a little   opening in eastern Prussia, made by a local Elder, and that   hopes are entertained quite an opening will be secured there,  Brother Smoot has sufferred a little term of impresionment at Kiel   for baptising a young girl under age. The Authorities of Bavaria  drove the Elders from there as fast as we send them in, and in   Switzerland, some spirit of antagonism is felt. By letters from   Brothers Willes, McCune, and Pratt, India, that the prospects   are not very bright there—that the man Booth, who went with   them, has been cut off from the church. The brethren find a few   old time saints, who are very generous, and hope that the way   will open up, by which they will accomplish some good.   Scandinavia is still alive and baptisms are occurring regularly   in the various parts of that mission. I now have 3 Elders in   Ireland, and they report their prospects as being very good   about 35 persons has been baptized in Belfast, and neighborhood   and the prospects are good for more. The Elders that left   home on the 11th of October, and also those who left on the 29th,   reached here in Safety, all being in good health, having   enjoyed themselves aside from a little seasickness, they have   all been appointed to and gone forward to their various fields.   Now comes their time of getting climated, and weaned from home,   and its comforts, which, takes about 6 months in that time   we usualy learn whether mens health will bear up in this   climate or whither it is best for them to return home. The   great struggle with the Elders now a days is to keep from getting   discouraged, over their lack of success, nervous, active men,   like to have some showing for their labor, and when they   struggle for several months, without any seeming results,   without they have got the pluck of a Paul, or the patience  of Job, they either tire out, become dispondent, and   are anxious to go home. I have tried in every way to make 
 October 3rd 5.    Lewis Allen  St. George;  Dear Brother,    Your most welcome   favor of September 4th came far to my hands on the   first of the present month, upon my return from   three weaks visit to Ashley. Nothing would have   given me greater pleasure than to have paid   you a visit and had the chance of associating   with our Dixie friends. Since my return to   Utah I have been kept vary busy attending the   various Stake Conferences being in some instances   the only one of the Twelve able to go.    Bro. Grant has been east.  Bros. Snow  Lyman, Young and Taylor South.  Bro Thatcher   North and I have been going about as the   spirit seemed to direct.  Bros Taylor  and Cannon are well.  I saw the latter a   few days ago.  I have learned nothing   about the row in London. 
 July 30 [188]4    President Wilford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City  Dear Brother.    Yours of July 10th came safely to hand and found us  well here in the office. The Article we were pleased to receive.  It will give encouragement to the Elders many of whom are  laboring without any seeming return—bonds of warning exhortat[io]n   Counsell or testimony are received with grattitude by us all  Many if us are young men Some men advanced in years but  young in experience in the ministry and when Elders like  yourself grown grey in the service drop words of encouragement  or counsell or Iexplain your own experiences they help us  to despel our own little troubles and take gold with renewed  vigir to push forward the cause of our God. It is the hardest  thing that an Elder has to do to day to keep from becoming  despondent. for to travel from weeks end to weeks end without  gathering any fruit requires a man to posess in a large  degree the sunshine if the Holy spirit in his composition.  Elder W D Williams President of the Manchester Conference speaks  in high terms of the earnestness your son displays in performing 
 I received letters from J.F. yesterday, he   was quite well when he wrote.    Our enemies are feeling quite fabulous   over Bp Sharps fall.  They are making every   effort they can to catch me. but have failed   up to the presant.  I expect several of the   brethren of the Twelve will attend conference   at Logan.  The Mexican business thus far is   all a failure, no land yet.    I feel that the present pressure upon us   was very necessary where we see so many of   the brethren go to the wall willing to cry   enough    I am happy and well and pray the   Lord to bless and ^prosper^ you.  May you have the   revelations of the Lord to guide you in all   of your movements.    I am your fellow servant in Christ.  John Henry Smith 
 every mans mission successful, by persuading them to remain   at their post, faithful and true. this can be done in most   instances, but occasionally it is impossible to [revive] men.  Your suggestion in regard to outdoor preaching, I had already   put into practice by warning the elders to keep watch upon   each other and to give advice when either was taking hurt,  from over exertion on the score named. When elders get off   to themselves, they are sometimes filled with Zeal and injure   themselves without anyone knowing that they are in the   least taking hurt. I have very little faith in the outdoor  preaching as to the good that will result therefrom. All   we can accomplish by it is warning the people. In the   past 2 Years I believe but 2 persons have come forward   and received the ordinances of the gospel as the result   of the outdoor work so far as I can learn. And it is a gran  question in my mind, whether we aint doing more harm   to our Elders by keeping them in this labor, than we are doing   good to the human family by warning them in this man  ner. I have however felt to crowd the brethren to this work,   as the only means by which they could get an experience   in public speaking, and bring out within them full faith   and a reliance upon God, for no extremely timid man   can stand the racket, and face these crowds of people   and testify to the mission of Joseph Smith. It requires    iron nerves and iron wills. Some of the Conferences in England   are becoming very thinly populated, Norwich Conference,  has left it it, only about 30 active members. The Bristol   Conference which takes in Cornwall, and several other counties   is said to only furnish 4 beds to the elders without paying   for them. The Leeds Conference is nearly in the same [fix's]   In these conferences where there are but few people I have   crowded the elders out, so that they might open make openings   where the gospel has not been preached for some years to   any great extent, they dont however meet with any great   success, and report that they are either compelld their  their beds, buy their food, or remain out in the weather,   and suffer from hunger, portions of other conferences of   the mission continue to do pretty well in furnishing places   to sleep and something to eat for the elders, but the day   seem to be gone by, when the saints take any responsibility   in aiding to clothe them, other portions of these conferences  seem to be barren and fruitless. At the present time, trade   is very bad, in ^all^ the Ship building sections of the country   thousands of men ar out of employment, and as a   result of this, great distress, is felt in their families 
 his duty, he is a young man of considerable promise and   will no doubt bring gladness to your heart for his faithfulness  and fidelity in the field. There can be no greater joy to a Father  that has devoted his life to the interest of a cause that he  knows is true than to have his children ceasing hold of the  iron rod and following in the paths of honour—continuing his   work and perpetuating his name. I am becoming very much  interested in trying to open up a mission to Turkey. I have been in  Correspondence for some months with a Turkish gentleman  one of whose letters I sent to Bro Taylor some time ago. I herewith  enclose one to you—I would like two missionaries, men who  have some taste for learning languages, and who could go to  that country and make a successful effort in introducing the  gospel in that land. You may have already considered this  Matter, but you can read the letter to the brethren in order that  they may judge of the spirit of it. I am pleased that Congress has   again adjourned which will give the country a little peace  It is a fearful thing that the people should stand in dread of  their lawmakers, and but for the faith of the saints in God they  certainly would. England is passing through another trying experience  in her political affairs. The Liberal ministry has tryed to enfranchise  2 Millions of Men—the law passed the commons, but the House of  Lords, have made an effort to stop the law, not daring to reject it  entire, they have tied it up in some form which prevents for the    present at least its passage. Popular demonstrations are the  order of the day—and while this is done peaceable there is  much clamour among the masses for a change in the consti-  tution which will do away with the House of Lords or  make them elective by the people. You have no doubt seen  in the Telegrams, the unearthing of some scandals in Dublin.  It seems to be an open secret, that quite a number of   Gentlemen moving in higher circles are charged with the  crime of sodomy. These parties have been arrested and are  being quietly investigated, that crime will bring transporta-  tion for life if proven guilty. One of the Judges of the Assign  Court of this County was found dead in a home of Ill fame  a few days ago. He died in the arms of his paramour—this  also is being secretly investigated. Cholera and small pox  or talk of them at least seems to be in the very air. Our next  Company will leave on August 30th, there will be in the  neighbourhood of 30 returning elders, most of them will have  been away from home nearly two years—and have labord as  a rule to the best of their ability. Some men are not missionaries  and they cannot help it doing the best they can in the circum  stances in which they are placed. Young men should be sent here 
 I am pleased to report to you that your son is an earnest   and efficient laborer in the vineyard, and he is making   every effort possible to qualify himself to become a polished   shaft in the hands of the Almighty for the preaching of the   gospel to the nations. I look upon him as one of my most   promising elders. I intend changing him after a little while   to the London Conference, which will extend his experience   and give him some extended ideas in regard to men & things.   Young Utah are gems in the field if they only get a   proper send off. We see by the papers that old satan is very   active. He no doubt got a little set back however on the 4th of   November. It is a little singular that a fellow who hath Republican   tendencies should be inclined to shout hurah when a Democrat   comes into power, not that I expect any particular changes   from the efforts of the new man, but while the devil is stopping   to spit on his hands the Kingdom of God is gaining strength   You no doubt had an excellent time at Conference and that   the Lord was with you in power all the brethren testify who   speak of being there. I have 3 elders in the mission who   have been out over two years I shall release them to return home   sometime during the winter. My health and spirits are first   class I have overtaxed my eyes a little with study, but they will   be all right when they have a little rest Give my kind regards   to all the brethren and accept a share yourself.    I am your fellow laborer in the vineyard of our Lord  John Henry Smith 
 because: better able to stand the climate, the poor food, long  walks, sometimes poor beds, and sometimes no beds. Elder  Reid of Ogden informs me he is 67 years of age and  he finds it impossible for him to put up with the hardship  incident to missionary life. his spirit is willing but his  flesh is weak. Elders Geo Goddard and Edward Stevenson  are making an ernest effort in Leicester their old home  they have hopes of accomplishing some good altho their first  meetings they regarded as almost failures so far as attendance  was concerned. We are continuing our outdoor preaching when  the wheather permits, it having been quite rainy for two weeks  past. has interifered with us some. The prospect of crops at present  is moderately good. Farmers are harvesting. In the some of the  Manufacturing districts business is very dull—quite a number  of our people are out of employment in various places. I trust  that arrangements may be made with the Church property that [Him]  and his thieving gang wont get their hands upon it even if Congress  should at some future time pass to vote a bill as the one which  fails to go through. Give my kind regards to the brethren  in the Office with you and any other of the brethren you  may meet my wife thought it best to go home and I felt  it was right. May the Lord bless and prosper you and lengthen  out your days that your testimony may be heard in Israel  until you are sattisfied with life your Brother in the Gospel  John Henry Smith 
 St. Joseph, Arizona, October 10th, 1888.    Pres. W. Woodruff, S. L. City    Dear Brother:    I beg leave to state that after experiencing great delays in sending our   report to the Committee—who are so widely scattered; one living at Tuba City,   one at Rama, New Mexico, one at Bush Valley, & one at St. Johns, we now submit   it to you, we wish to refer to Elder Brigham Young as able to make any explanation   you may wish as he was conversant with the Business.    I am your Brother in the Covenant.    John Bushman, Chairman 
 St. Joseph, Dec. 5th 1888    Pres. W. Woodruff,  S. L. City.    Dear Brother:    Your answer to the Sunset Committee's Report was rec'd in due time—a   coppy of which was sent to the members. The means have been all divided, and the   committee will send all the books and papers to you by Team the first safe  opportunity as there are rather much to send by mail.    Hoping yourself and your Brethren with you are well I remain your  Brother in Christ,    John Bushman 
 -[Updated letter, but written sometime in December 1888, perhaps Dec. 5.]-    President W. Woodruff and the Apostles:    I desire to inform you of our condition in this ward; last week dureing   the heavy Rains we had the largest freshet we have had (sinece 1878) which took out   about half of our Dam., and as there are only 15 families liveing here they feel   some what Discouraged, and feel it a heavy labor to put the Dam in without any   asistance, and should any more leave it would be still harder for us to maintain   our location here. The present Dam was put in with Piles about 4 years ago and   has stood the freshets very well, we repaired it last summer and it appeared   quite safe, our People began to think we had the Dam Perminant and have some   pretty good substantial homes and farms, our lands seems to yeald very well when   it is properly tilled, I am confident if we had as many more settlers we could   establish a very good place here, and sustain our selves very well, as we have   had plenty water the driest seasons and there is plenty land to take up by Home-  stead or Premption, the most of the land we farm is held by Homesteads, the   Health of the People is excelent and a good spirit Prevails, ever Praying for the   Prosperity of Zion I am your Brother,    John Bushman, Bp. 
 Sunset, Apache Co. Arizona, Nov. 24, 1879.    Dear Brother Tenney;    I received your communication on Saturday night at the Springs 40 miles   west of here. I arose early in the morning and came to Sunset at night and have   counseling with Pres. Lot Smith concerning your purchase with Mr. Barth and our   united voice is for you to accept his proposals But we would like to know what   that 2 1/2 acres is reserved for and by whom. Cannot that be included in the pur-  chase? And again does the purchase include all the water right of the creek or   does the west side hold claims to a part of the waters of the creek? Brother   Smith and myself both would rather you would buy out all the water right of the   town if you can. If the people hold the right on the west side of the creek   will they not claim the surplus water and play the Stinson game on us and still   occupy the west side and let their cattle run over our crops. We would like to   understand, as far as we can, cooncerning all these matters. We would rather buy   out the place if we could so as to make a Mormon town of it, and not be mixed   with Jews, Mexicans and Gentiles.    I am satisfied that Barth is a sharper and will get all he can and you will   have to be careful and in making the purchase with him do not let him have a   loop hole to crawl out, and if you can get the 2 1/2 acres you had better get it.   I know he is a slippery man but if anybody can trade with him I know you can.   I wish You would send me a letter by the bearer and answer the foregoing questions.   If your purchases will take all the water of the creek, if not what portion?   Will there be any water claim on the west, if so how much? Does Barth own the   2 1/2 acres and what does he want to keep it for? Will he ^not^ have a hold on a part of   the water to make us trouble? We would like information upon all these points.   Will there be surplus water for him or anybody else to claim to make us trouble?    We would like you to buy all the water rights of the place if possible. We   think we can back you up so as to make the purchase. Is sSt. Johns surveyed by   the U. S. surveyors? You say the 2 1/2 acres is on the edge of town on the east   side of the creek. I thought the village was on the west side of the river. Does   your purchase include the dwellings or any of them? We would like an explanation   of all these things. Brother Smith is anxious to have you buy out of the whole town   if you could, if not get all the water rights you can.    Of course you will not have a chance to consult with us about anything   after you get this until you get your purchase made, but do the best you can   and whatever bargain you make bind it with a band of iron so strong that no  one can break it. Write by the bearer all you can about it and as soon as you   get the bargain send me word by mail.    I shall write to Brother Taylor immediately and tell him to have mis-  sionaries who are coming to take possession of the place to bring cows with   them of the age you speak of. Do not fail to make the purchase if possible. I   Tthink that is all I need to say upon the subject. With regard to occupying   the Colorado Meadows, there should be means taken immediately to occupy the   place by the brethren. We are now making arrangements to fit up teams and   send 2 from Sunset, 2 from Bringham City and will call for 1 from St. Joseph   and 4 perhaps from Snowflake and will send what we can to you to take up the   Meadow forth with, but we shall want you to go with them to go with them to Greers and help   them settle or locate and Gilbert Greer might make a claim and I want these   brethren to locate their claims so as to exclude the St. Johns folks from   getting a hold there. 
 We will start them off forthwith and send them to you. I want all these   things kept as secret as possible until we get the place secured. We have   concluded to start 4 men tomorrow morning to St. Joseph and from there to   Brother Greers and Brother Brookbank will take the letter to you from St.   Joseph. You will find him a No. 1 man and I want him to be with you in the   mission, I know you can work together like a charm and I now want to say to   you once for all this is the voice of all our Council and if you want any more,  I wilol say it is the Will of the Lord that Ammon M. Tenney preside over this   mission. Therefore make no more excuse but round up your shoulders and receive   this mission and appointment and God will bless you and make you an instrument   in his hands of bringing many of the House of Israel into the Church and Kingdom   of God, who will be saved through your instrumentality. Therefore, go to, unite  with your brethren and lead out in this work and open your mouth, preach the Gos-  pel to the Lamanites or Nephites as you find them and prophecy unto them as you   shall be led by the power of God and the Lord will stand by you and you will be   able to accompllish all that your heart desires in righteousness.    As Brother Brookbank will not return, but will stop with you, therefore   send your communications to me by mail, unless there is a private conveyance   open. I want the Meadows taken possession of about the same time you buy St.   Johns or a little before so that they cannot get possession. Now if you make   any change in your purchase of St. Johns notify me immediately as I may want   to write to President Taylor.    Concerning your going to St. Johns with your family; if you purchase   perhaps you had better go there and take possession of it. But I want you to   go with the Brethren to Brother Greer's and scatter them through the Meadow   and take up all the desirable places as fast as the brethren come. I do not   intend to let daylight, dark night or grass grow under my feet to stop me   trying to do my duty or helping to settle Arizona or  New Mexico or bringing   the House of Israel into the Kingdom of God—not if I know it.    I would like you to instruct the missionaries in Spanish eor council them   to improve their time in it what you can. I have thought of asking you what   you would think trying to buy out that Mexican at the Spring where we got a   drink of water as we came into Meadow. It might do no harm to try. I do not   think of anything more at this time.    My love and blessings to your wives, children, mother, brother and friends.    Yours Brother in the Gospel  Lewis Allen. (Wilford Woodruff)    PRIVATE: I am going to write to Brother Greer to assist the brethren to locate   the Meadow. Now I do not know how much of the Spirit of Zion he has got. His son   Gilbert has the Spirit of his mission. I think if he has and can locate a claim   with the rest it might be well for them to do it. I would like you to see how   Brother Greer is and if he feels like it I would like him to help what he can in it.    I have given Brother Gilbert Greer a notification of his appointment as a   missionary to the Lamanites under your direction. I would like him to take hold   immediately with you and perhaps he can assist you in your temporal affairs.   Some of these missionaries who will go to the Meadows who to make claims as far   as they can I want them to enter upon their missions as soon as convenient. 
 I do not wish to make any presidency in this mission separate from the   presiding officers of these Stakes, so while I am in the country I will give   you ^what^ council I can, but you may consider yourself under the Presidency of Jesse   N. and Lot Smith, but while any of the twelve are in the country it is their   province to give counsel upon all these matters as far as they have an oppor-  tunity.    I am soon expecting Brigham Young and several others from the north,   before long and we may call and visit you.    L. A. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING   AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42, Islington, Liverpool,  August 16th 1889.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    This will in-  troduce to you Brother Thomas R. Galbraith   from Sligo Ireland, who is a Priest in the   Liverpool Branch and who is desirous to   make himself useful in assisting in the   building up of the kingdom of God on the   earth in any manner that his time or   talents can be made available. As he is   comparatively a stranger I have taken the   liberty to introduce him unto you in the   hope there may be a vacancy in some   of the Latter-day Saint schools where his   talent might be available as he has been   very successful amongst children and   takes much pleasure in that profession   and believes that Theology should be one   of the principle subjects in education as the   fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.  Trusting you will pardon the liberty I have   taken and kindly consider the interest I have in   the young & rising generation, I remain    Your brother in the gospel  George Teasdale

President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City U. T.    Dear Brother:    A company of  Saints from Scandinavia leave Liverpool to-day  in charge of Elder J. C. A. Weibye of Manti.  with Elder Mads Jorgensen, of Provo, and Andrew  Knudsen, of Provo, as his 1st and 2nd Counsellors Elder J. P.  Toolsen, of Smithfield, as clerk & recorder. The other elders   returning are Andrus Mortensen, of West Porterville, Jas.  Anderson, of Spanish Fork, Ole Petersen, of Bennington,  Hans Sarrensen, of Orderville, Ola Jonson of Logan  (who has added Nordberg to his name) Jas. Thompson of Brig-  ham City, Hans Larson, of Kamas, Ole Olesen of Lewis-  ton, O. J. Johnson, of Plain City, and Oluf Jensen of  Brigham City. H. P. Jensen, of Provo. The company  without counting the returning missionaries num-  ber 176 souls 93 adults and 83 children (There  is one amongst them who was baptized when  eight years old—he says—who has been sent for  by his twin brother who is likely to be sent back  his appearance is so much against him ragged  and rough. It is much to be regretted this kind  of people are sent for, surely we have enough  of the vagobond element amongst us. The saints  have objected to his company so we have had 
 to berth him with the gentiles. We cannot be  responsible for this class. His name is Adolph  Peter Hansen aged 21, Booked for Salt Lake City.  All this I learn by representation which should  be reliable. It has pleased our heavenly Father  to draw into His fold a young man who is  the son of a clergyman of the established Church  of England. He has been an earnest worker  in education and in faith relying upon God  to provide the necessary means, for the inde  gent. His name is Thomas Richard Galbraith.  He has been in the office a good deal and I  have taken to him as an honest man. He is  going to work his passage to New York hav-  ing obtained a situation on the S. S. Wyoming  He is a sailor having been apprenticed to the  sea and travelled a good deal. He entered  as a sailor but the captain has placed him  amongst the stewards. He was going to work  until he obtained sufficient means to go  to Utah but I have advanced him the money  feeling that his labors will be more valua  ble to us amongst the rising generation.  He appears to be a gentleman, humble,  prayerful and willing. Has quite a good  faith and trust in God and improves  upon acquaintance although he has quite  the ministerial expression that he has been  trained in which will ^doubtless^ give way before the 
 natural education he will obtain through  association in the Kingdom of God. I should  have used him here in the work of the min  istry, and he was quite willing, but I have  reflected that it would be better for him  to get a home in Zion and better educated  in true principle, with some experience in  the gospel to better qualify him for that  labor. I have given him a letter of intro-  duction to yourself so you may see him  and if you think proper for him to  engage in school keeping in the Latter-  day Saints schools that he can do so. I   have also given him a letter of introduc-  tion to Bro. James Jack who could intro-  duce him to yourself when convenient.  This has been entirely my own arrange  ment Bro. Galbraith never asked such  a thing. He said if he could reach Utah  he was satisfied he could make his   living and was going trusting in  the Lord, and this is what the Lord has  done for him, for my natural suspicious  nature would have prompted me to take  no such course. I tell him he need not  thank me for this but Him who has  so wrought upon me to take this step. 
 The future will unfold whether I have been  led right or not. So far as I am concerned  I am willing to risk it for my impressions  are he will prove true blue. I regret to  inform you that Bro Payne from Filmore  now laboring in London will have to re-  turn through delicate health. With regard  to Bro. Jas. Leaing he is the best missionary  we have in the field. He is doing an  excellent work in London presiding over  that Conference and if it would be  agreeable to all we should be pleased  to keep him until next spring but if it  is necessary he should return, why he  will leave in October. Bro. Payne is a  worker, he is a first class missionary, and  has done a good work. Bro. Wm Kelson   will have to return through ill health  He is hardly capable for the hardships   of missionary life in the British Isles.  I am happy to say we are all reasonably  well at 42 and join in kind love to  yourself Counsellors and brethren with  you. Hoping and praying for the re-  demption of Zion I remain as ever:    Yours very affectionately in the Gospel  George Teasdale

August 20th 1889.    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    President J. U. Stucki   of the Swiss and German Mission has been down   with the small pox which he contracted in Bohemia   at the house of Bro. Dittrich. He was travelling through   the mission and taken sick while in Stuttgart with a   heavy fever and chills, pains in his back and head   which kept increasing on him until he broke out. He   thought he had caught a severe cold and kept moving   about filling his appointments being all the time exposed   to heat causing sweatings and then to chilly winds,   and made the trip from Basel to Bern in a   draughty railway car. He mentioned these facts   to show how miraculously he was healed by the   power of God being so exposed to heat & cold. When   he reached Bern Bro Brandley felt determined   to wait on Pres Stucki and nurse him, as he had no   fear. The Brethren administered to him and in less   than two weeks he was up again comparatively  well, only weak. No one took the disease and no   one in the house outside of our own folks knew   that anyone had the disease. Bro. Stucki has hardly   any marks from the effects of the disease. He   has surely been very much blessed of our heavenly Father. 
 Bro Stucki reports that while he was in Reichenberg   he sent for Bro. L. M. Cannon in Saxony as he thought   it would be a good plan for Bro Dittritch to have some   help, but through a couple of traitors in the Church   a strong persecution arose. Bro. Dittritch was arrest  ed for committing the crime of teaching an unauthor-  ized religion, baptizing &c and the prospect was   he would get perhaps a year and a half imprison-  ment so he concluded to give them the slip and   he was then in Bern. Four of his children had been   sick with the small pox, one of them had died and   his wife had been sick. His family is in a very   pitiable condition alone amongst traitors and   enemies, only a few Saints to sympathise and   they too poor to render any assistance. Bro Cannon   barlely escaped arrest. I think I have stated before   that the Swiss and German Mission will require   some more missionaries to relieve those who   are going home in the fall. They will want at   least seven good missionaries for the fall indeed   the field is amply large for many more elders.  Prest Stucki is an excellent missionary. He says "The  Elders feel well everywhere and they are blessed   in their labors more especially in South Germany   Four ^persons^ have been baptized in Saxony who seem to be   earnest and faithful. I am somewhat troubled about   the Turkish Mission. I receive letters from Bros  Hintzie, J. M. Sjodabl, W. H. Smart and Locander   With the exception of Bro. Hintzie and J. M. Sjodabl 
 II    they do not seem to have much faith in the   Turkish Mission or in Bro Hintze. They say   he tells the people too much from pre-existence to   Adam being the God of this earth and that God is   only man perfected. The principle topic is a coloni-  zation scheme, means for printing, and  house rent   and "backshish" which I am informed "is absolutely   necessary." Bro Hintze says "I cannot say what   we may need in means because it is all so   uncertain where a government is to be bought   with money. Then I do not know what to apply   for without knowing what our brethren will   sustain. Excuse me for a suggestion. As the   whole matter now stands, and as it is of   great importance would it not be better   that you and the Presidency at home see me   face to face so as to make proper arrangements  as to our efforts here? It would save me ans  time and anxiety." The above subjects of those   wants of the mission and schemes for getting  the gospel before. the people, all requiring means  are what the letters I receive are composed of.  Bro. Clove is returning sick. Just about  the time he has some smattering of the lan-  guage enough to converse he is obliged to  return. I watched to see binic until I wrote to   you but concluded to write for the prospect  of acertaining how far I am at liberty to go 
 in the using of means for instead of one   establishment there are three expecting to   draw on this office. One in Constantinople  one in Aintab and one in Palestine. With   the exception of Bro. Sjodabl the brethren   do not seem, to have much faith in the   Turkish Mission only to kill time. They   have got the experience of Elder Clove   and have seen how he has passed his   time and of the labors of Elder Hintze   and his experience, seen the class of   converts who have professed to become   converted and got acquainted with the   opposition of all around them and the   absence of any interest manifested that   they do not write very encouraging let-  ters. If you have noticed any commanica-  tions from the elders in that mission it has   been about the manners and customs of   the people as they view it. Letters that seem   to have been written for a consideration to   help them to a little means in their needy   condition. But so far as missionary labors   are concerned they do not seem to have   much to write about. I would be pleased   to hear from you how far you will be willing  I should supply this mission with means beecause   they have drawn upon us to consume all the   three hundred dollars appropriated. I wrote to   Prest Hintze asking about how much he thought it   would need for publishing some tracts &c and 
 III    telling him that I did not think we wanted   to buy the government for the sake of the   privilege to preach the gospel, that called   for the remarks I have quoted from his   letter. Some time ago the brethren got some   printing done in germany and all the tracts   were confiscated. In No 34 Star we have publish-  ed a letter from Prest Hintze. I think some policy   should be defined with regard to this Mis-  sion. Prest H. writes Our house rent £5.0.9 is again   due and I have no M. funds only to rely upon your   assistance until all affiers matters are settled  I extract a portion of his letter for your consideration  Turkey is a long way from home. It takes over   $20000 perhaps $250 00/100 to reach here. Most elders are   stripped when they arrive (I was even without   the necessary means to reach Constantinople  and may as well state right here that I have   no present resources to raise funds. I am therefore   forced to look for assistance to me a continual   regret) There for the elders to go into the interior   and live takes another good round sum Hence   the fact is we arrive poor, and we nearly all need   assistance from home in some way, and that   assistance is not forth coming. Therefore we have  had to ask your assistance. For instance my Bp.  was especially instructed by Apostles F. D. Richards 
 and John H. Smith to assist me and when I wrote   to him about the twenty pounds I personally bor-  rowed of your office he did not even answer; He   is not a bad man but I understand my case is   among the common ones." Well I think I have   said enough about the Turkish Mission. If it   was now a question of dollars and dimes I   should hesitate to bother you with so long   a letter. The ani-mormons have been breathing   out threatnings and this office is watched.  We are all well in health and spirits  at present. Bro. Brookband has been quite   unwell but is better. We keep sending Bro  John L. papers when there is anything of   interest. Bro. C. D. Fjeldsted writing from   Copenhagen Aug 12, says "There is quite an   opposition started in the Aalborg Conference  all the Utah brethren except two having   been called before the police authorities  and one already received his sentence of   banishment. Will inform you further as   soon as we learn particulars." The elders   had been successful in baptizing a member   and it aroused the priests so the brethren said.  With kindest regards to yourself, Counsellors   and all with you, I remain as ever    Your brother in the covet  Geo Teasdale

President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    On Wednesday the  4th inst we were visited by the following brethren and  sister who arrived in Liverpool from New York per  Guion S. S. Nevada. There were three appointed to  the Netherlands. Jos. H. Lambert, Albert Spencer  and Louis W. Simmons. Eight were appointed to the  British Isles and were located in the following Conferen-  ces Samuel W. Western and John E. Huish, to the Bir-  mingham; George Marshall and Robert H. Hodge  to the Manchester; John H. Clark and Edwin John  Longhurst, to the London; Charles England to the  Norwich Conferences and John T. Evans to  Wales. Bro. John B. Milner and his wife on a  visit to relatives and business. They were all in  good health and spirits. We held a council meet-  ing in the morning with the missionaries and they  were appointed to their fields of labor. They met  with us at our evening meeting in Bittern St,  and bore their testimonies and expressed their wil-  lingness to do their best to fill a good mission.  (Prest Jos. Leaing, of the London Conference, who was  with us at our morning council, gave the brethren  some most excellent counsel on missionary labors. 
 Bro. Joseph Leaing has expressed himself as every  Latter-day Saint, or servant of God feels. He  wishes to be where the Lord wants him. In your  communication to me, of July 23rd, you say—"We think  it quite proper for you to release Br. Jos Leaing so  that he may return home if he so desires—" Now he  has never expressed that desire. He is one of the  Lords Own, a minute man, a bright live miss-  ionary and waits patiently to be released when  he shall receive that word. He has been here  three years next month, having arrived here on  October 13, 1886 and is willing to stay as long as  he is required. He enjoys the fellowship of the  Holy Ghost, and consequently knows that the  work we are engaged in is of God, and guided  by the Spirit of revelation, according to the  order of the Priesthood that He had appointed  to the responsibility of presidency and the  directing of the labors of their fellowservants  under His direction, or revealed will, and  so he says "when the Lord manifests His will  for me to return I shall be pleased to do so,  but until then I am perfectly willing to la-  bor wherever I may be appointed." As I un-  derstand it, my beloved president, this is the  true feeling of every disciple of Jesus Christ.  It is, "Father not my will but thine be done."  It is the glory of God to have such humble  faithful soul who love to serve Him and 
 keep His commandments, because they want  to. Now I would be pleased to have your mind  on this question—Shall Bro. Leaing stay until the  Spring or go him this fall? I ask this question  to satisfy my own mind as much as any-  thing else. I will write more freely next time  after I have received your answer. I have  received a letter from Bro. Job Pingree in  which he says he has had an interview  with yourself & counsel and some members  of the Twelve "in my behalf" I am at a loss to  remember whatever I could have said to him  to call forth such an expression. Bro Pingree  spent a few days with us and we much  enjoyed his excellent spirit. We talked to-  gether very freely about the mission and  the spirit of the gentiles. He had quite  an experience visiting his friends and  acquaintances. He was with me in the prayer  room and I read him some letters from  the elders, all testifying to the spirit of  indifference in some places and mobocra-  tic feeling in others so that he got quite an  insight into the condition of the mission  and I remember telling him that if he saw  any of the authorities at home he would be  well posted to give them a pretty good report 
 much better then I could do through the me-  dium of a sheet of paper; and when he left all  I remember saying was give my kind love to  the Presidency, or any of the Twelve you may see  and tell them we are patiently rowing against  the stream. We have been sounding the gospel  trumpet by preaching and destributing tracts  and consequently have stirred up the people,  unprincipled men finding Jarman are making  a good living by traduscing the "mormons" have  adopted a similiar mode of obtaining a  living and selling Jarmans books of course  all this inflames the people against us. You  know how ready they are to believe anything  against us. But we are busy doing all we  can to seek out the House of Israel and  trying by the grace of God to do our duty  and tell the people what the Book of Mormon  is and supply them at a cheap rate.  In  all our heavenly Father has blessed us and en-  couraged as in our labors and duties.  It is  His work and we are only poor representa-  tives of His cause, but we love to serve Him and  labor in our poor way looking to Him for the  increase, and grace ourselves to over come and  endure unto the end in His Church & Kingdom.  So far as we are concerned we are not discouraged.  If the people do not want the gospel it is their 
 loss not ours. If they prefer the testimony of  an escaped lunatic going through the  land with a lying spirit traducing Gods  people, why we cannot help it. Our Elders  have been testifying to the restoration of  the gospel and the authority of God,  with the priesthood, to administer in the  ordinances of His House, and offering them  the Pearl of Great Price—Eternal Lives—and  they despise them and their testimony, so  it is not to be wondered at, they should  crowd together to listen to and believe  a lie, that they may be damned who  have pleasure in unrightiousness and be-  lieve not the truth. I do not know that  we should condemn these people so much  when we see the course being pursued in  the gathering place of the saints amongst  those who have been converted and blessed  of the Lord, and their children who have  been raised in the midst of light and  truth. From all we hear through the press  and from private sources, if there are  not those in Zion ripening for the burn-  ing as well as those on the outside world,  why then we will gladly confess ourselves 
 mistaken. President Woodruff, the elders in  Israel, at home or abroad, who are serving  God and keeping His commandments  are not discouraged. They understand  the signs of the times and know that but  few men will be left. The propecies do not  point to the Church of the Lamb being so very  numerous; they know it is a strait and narrow  way that leads to life everlasting, and are  more interested in making their own  calling and election sure then getting  discouraged because of the folly or in-  difference of others. Do not think we are  discouraged or weary of serving God, for  it is not so. We simply trust in God and  seek His counsels day and night. We  want His will to be done, we want His  Kingdom, not only for ourselves, but for the  benefit of our posterity—of unborn generations.  We want the government of God and the rule  of His Priesthood—of righteousness—for we have  all faith that where the meek and pure in  heart rule we will have a reign of righteous-  ness. With kindest love and blessing to your-  self, counsellors, and brethren of the Apostles,  I remain as ever   Your unworthy brother in Christ  George Teasdale    P.S.

North Fox Islands, Vinalhaven, Maine, Sept. 15, 1837    Aphek & Azubah Woodruff,  Honoured Parents  As duty  And the commandments of God hath called your Son to stand upon  the Islands of the sea in defence of the word of God, & the testi-  mony of Jesus Christ, I am under the necessity of making  use of my pen to communicate all information that you  recieve from me, but this is a privilege inasmuch as we can  not do it by word of mouth. I would inform you that I  recieved a letter from my wife yesterday informing me that she  took two letters out of the Office for me, one from you, & the other   from Brother Asahel. She gave me the purport of them. I was   glad to hear from you, & all the friends & esspecially that the word had  the desired affect in Aunt Cossetts family, & with others. I would like to  be with you & our friends in Connecticut long enough to build up a  Church, but if I cannot be, I pray God to send some faithful servent among  you to teach the word. I expect you wish to hear where I am, & what I am  doing &c. On the 19th of Aug, in company with Elder Hale, I left Portland on  board the steamboat Bangor, foxr fox Islands, Vinalhaven. After travling 100  miles on the steam boat; we took a vessel & was landed on North fox Island at 2 oclok   Sunday morning following, entire strangers & about peneyless. We called at the first  house & retired to rest, as we had slept none through the day & night. We arose at 8  oclock took breakfast. I then enquire if their was any priest or religion on the Island.  they informed us theirre was a Baptist meeting house & church & priest in the  centre of the Island, & that there would be preaching to day. In the name of the  Lord we hastened to the place. Meeting had commenced. I sent for the deacon  to come to the door; I told him we were servents of God, we had a message to  the people & wished to be herd. he informed the priest of it. he invited us into  the pulpet. After he closed they had a short intermission I then arose & addressed  the congregation, and it was amid many peculiar feelings; knowing that it was the first  time the voice of an Elder ^of^ the Latter Day Saints, was herd upon one of the Islands of the sea,  to set forth the fullness of the gospel. When I closed I gave out several appointments for  preaching in different parts of the Island, which was 9 miles long & 2 miles wide containing 800  inhabitants divided into four distrects having four school houses. We presented Mr Newton (this  Baptist priest) the Book of Mormon he was mild, did not object to it, said he would read it. In the  first fourteen days, we preached nineteen discourses, & the whole Island flocked out to hear.  The priest began to see his foundation giving way, he was alarmed & began to cry against us  & would not let us have the meeting house. But the excitement ^was^ so great & the people so much  in our favor that on Sunday the 27th the people asseb assembled at a school house to hear us 
 While Mr. Newton had the meeting house to himself without one solitary soul to accompany him.  Even the deacons of the church were attending our meetings & enquiring into these things &  & calling upon us to visit them, & the sound went abroad to other Islands of the  sea with rapidity, & they came over in their ships & boats to hear for themselves. On  Sunday the 3rd Sept. I preached to a Large congregation assembled together from different  Islands after I closed a very wealthy, respectable Sea Captain & his Lady came  foreward & wished to be baptised. We repaired to the waters of the Atlantic & Elder Hale  lead them down into the sea & baptized them. These are the first baptized upon the Islands  of the sea (to my knowledge) by the Elders of Israel, & they are the first fruits of our min-  istry here. & On last Sunday the 10 th of the month, I met a large congregation at the same  place from different Islesands, & & preached to them from Math 16 ch 17, 18, & when I closed  another sea captain a member of the Baptist church came forward for baptism & also a   young Lady. We repaired to the sea shore, & while the people throng'd the beach I lead  them forth into the ocean & baptized them both for the remission of their sins & lade  hands upon them & they received the Holy ghost & were made glad. On the Tuesday  following three others wished to be baptized & the ordinance was administered unto them  by Elder Hale which makes seven we have baptized. Thus you seae the Lord hath not  sent us here in vain. There is many on our right & left ready as it were to step into  the waters of Baptism. Calls begin to salute us from the different Islands come &  preach to us, come & preach to us. We have visited South Fox Island & held five meet-  ings with them, they came out by hundreds & filled the homes. South Fox Island is 10 miles   long & 5 wide containing 1000 inhabitants with 6 school houses no meeting house but a methodist  church, & a priest in their midst. They have 3 saw mills & one grist mill these are all tide  mills vinal haven fits out rising of 100 vessels for fishing & mostly from this Island.    The inhabitants of Vinalhaven are wealthy, healthy, industrious, intelligent, generous & very hospitable  to strangers notwithstanding they are mostly fishermen. pop 1,800. Vinalhaven includes both of fox Islands. North  Island is rather rocky & rough have some fine farms, rase good wheat, barley, & potatoes, which is the staple pro-  ductions, but little stock excepting sheep which are numerous. they have but just finished haying and are now  in the midst of wheat harvest. There is an aboundance of raspburies and gooseburies on these Islands, but are  now mostly gone. not much of any other fruit. The timber is spruice, fir, & hemlock. Their is one Post Office &  store on this Island. one tide grist mill, &c.    South Fox Island is as near without any form or void I think as  any think I ever saw. It is almost impossible for the best historian to give an exact description of it. it is a universal  mass of ledges & shelves of rocks formed into hills & valleys cut up into necks & points to make room for the  coves and harbours that run through & through this Island. One may form some faint idea of it, on learning that it is  supposed to be rising of 100 miles round the Island to follow the beach in all its crooks & angles. There is some small parts  of this Island under cultivation but it is at the expens of great labour & toil. The hills are timbered with pitch pine and   spruce, the timber & bushes principly grow out of the cracks of the rocks, while the valleys are timbered in the same  manner with fir & birch. this people procured their wealth & living wholey by fishing, perhaps their is no people that supply  greater quantities of fish than they of this Island. many of them fish at Newfoundland & prepare them for sale here. their is  many kinds of fish here around these Island such as Whale, Blackfish, shark, ground shark, Pilot fish, Hors mackerel,  stergeon, Holloboat, Salmon, Cod, Pollock, Hake, Haddock, Shad, Mackerel Tom cod, Bass, Alewives Herren, Pohagen, Dolphin  Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Scate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Muttonfish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers,  Munkfish, Nurs fish, Sunfish, Sword fish, Tharsher, catfish, whiting, scuppog, Tootog, Eyefish, Minney's, cunner, Ling, Eels,   Lobsters, clames, scollops, Mussels, Wrinkles, seal, & Porposes &c &c. & many others not named. I have stood on the  shore & seen large schools of Mackerel come up to us so that we could catch any quantity of them with hooks that we  wished, also the beach is supplyed with clames in almost any part of the Island. The adjoining Islands are more fertile  than these. In a clear day I can view with the naked eye about fifty Island of the sea many of which are inhabited, & sometimes  20 or 30 gallant ships are passing by us at once &c. I have not givien this brief history of these Islands because my mind is more 
 on these things than my calling, for it is not. consequently I wish to call your minds back again to my labour in the vineyard    I remarked that many came out to hear us on the South Island. The methodist priest  became alarmed for fear his foundation also was in danger, & he came over whare we were baptizing  & made friends with the Baptist priest, (like Herod & Pilate) and called a meeting I went out  to hear him. [##Luke 23:12##] He commenced warm hostilities against the Book of Mormon and our principles  I wrote down his discours & are to give answer to it next Sunday, at which time I expect  to meet a numerous assembly I learned he would not be present to hear my answer so I  arose & rectifyed some of his wild mistakes in his presensce before he left the congregation.  The Baptist priest has written Letters & even gone himself to the main land after several priests  to come over and help them, declairing if they do not come the churches here will surely  fall. -[But cursed is man that puteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm saith the Lord]- But O ye  priests of Baal your cry is in vaine. The God of Israel hath set his hand to recover Israel his people  The stone has begun to roll. God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the wise, and  with them he will rend your Kingdoms. The cry of the Saints is assending unto the Ears of the Lord  of Sabaoth for Ephraim. The Apostles of the Lamb of God are bearing the Keys of his Kingdom  on the shores of Europe. Yea & the mighty captains of these Islands are receeving the gospel of  JESUS CHRIST & injoying its power. And the call of many from distant Islands has  already entered into our Ears to come & preach to them. My own Book of Mormon  has this day taken its departure over the billows of the great deep to teach those that trade in  ships at sea, & the word & work is propelled by the arm of JEHOVAH. And every weapon  formed against Zion shall soon be broken, & he that raises his puny arm against it, is fighting  against God, & shall soon mourn because of his loss. I say these things are so as God [himself]  & the Spirit beareth record & the record is here. Therefore O Babylon thy fall is sure.    My dear parents suffer me to drop a few words of my  meditations on this paper. When I think where I am, what my calling is, & where I have been   & whare I shall be, & have to do in this generation, I marvel & wonder. I [page torn]  myself. A few years since, I was tendindg mill as other men not expecting to do [page torn]  to live & di[e] with my friends. But how changed the scene, the last four years has [page torn]  the plow, called me into the ministry, bestowed the Holy priesthood, annointing, [page torn]  Blessing upon my head, & called me into the ranks of [page torn] [s]eventy Apostles to pus [page torn]  from the ends of the earth, and act a conspicuous part in winding up the august scene of these last  days in rending the kingdoms of darkness, and error with everlasting truth. It has called me to  visit 16 different states in America, & travel about 14,000 miles to preach the word of God, and  are now standing upon the Islands of the Sea, & thousands seeking wisdom & instruction  at my mouth, While at the same time its wise & learned complain Bitterly that I am  sapping the foundations of their Holy religion, churches & kingdom, & the ships of the sea  spread their canvas to bring captains & sailors to hear my voice. I say amid these  truths I ask myself the question who am I. ^I^ am that poor, weak, ignorant, Illiterate  Willford. then I have nothing to boast. No God forbid. It is not Willford that has done this,  but it is the power & work of God. I'll acknowledge he hath chosen the weak things  of this world to perform his work with, & if I glory it shall be in the cross of Christ    I cannot tell when I shall see any of you again. their was some invisidble power seemed to  hurry me from connecticut to come on my journey, it has been so with me ever since I left Kirtland, untill I reached these  Islands, and the reason was because of the great work to be done here, for the sound will go from here to a vast number of the  Islands to prepare the way before us. But I rejoice that I had the privilege of visiting you at all. I now feel as though it will be my privilege  to visit you again & build up a church in connecticut. But if I do not I pray GOD to send some one among you that will. I have great  faith yet to believe that many of my blood relations & other friends will stand in the covenant before they die. yes I believe my   Parents & their family will, for I know they are of the Blood of Ephraim, and the Lord will never suffer the good my father hath   done to the poor in his ^day^ go unrewarded. I believe you will both live to see a change in this world which is fast hastning. it would be great joy to my  soul to see you stand in the covenant. It is the work of God that hath called me to do as I have done, and it marvelous in mine eyes. I rather expect  to spend next summer amid these Islands of the sea. I intend to visit Deer Island as soon as possible, it is but 12 miles to it. it contains 4000  inhabitants, and theirre is but one priest among them. I do not know whare I shall spend the winter, whether here or in Scarborough. My friends  may still direct letters to Scarborough. Give my respects to Eunice, To Uncle Ozem & family & Aunt Cossetts family I think of writing to them both & also  ^to^ Brother Asahel, & finally remember me to all inquiring fr^i^ends. O how I wish they would all receive the fullness of the gospel. Dear  Parents Pray for me & watch the signs of the times. I want to see you all much but I'll be content whare God would have me. Elder  Hale, & Phebe both wish to be remembered to you and all inquiring friends. That the peace of GOD may abide with you & that  your lives health & strength may be prescious in HIS sight, is the prayer of your Dutiful son   Willford Woodruff

 Rochester Sangamon County Illinois Dec 19th 1838    [FIGURE] Eunice Woodruff    My Dear Sister    Although I am in the midst of a  croud & but a few moments allotted me to write yet I feel it my Duty to appropriate  these few moments in communicating a few words to you & my Dear parents.  I thought it proper to direct this sheet to you in consequence of the writing  on the 3rd page which is the production of Brother Asahels pen which I found  among his papers which appears to be an address to you. Whether it is a copy of  writings already in your possession or not I am unable to say. But as I feel anxious  to put in your possession all writings that you have sent him or that he has  directed to you is the cause of my writing upon the same sheet. As Death has  closed all communications between Asahel & yourself & our parents I feel  it my duty to give you all information that I possess concerning his sickness  & Death or any thing concerning him that will be of interest to you. I also  feel it my Duty to write to you as often as my circumstances will admit  & I have matter of interest to comunicate. I have much upon  my mind at this time I would like to communicate which I mus[t]  omit for want of time but I will touch upon some importent items  Firstly I hold in my hands a letter Dated Farmington Oct 31st 1838 from  Aphek & Azubah & Eunice Woodruff to Mr James Dayson. in fine I have  in my possession (I suppose) all the writings that were Directed to Asahel as well as  his own compositions I took them because I supposed that I should be able  to put them into the possession of my parents & Sister sooner than they   could obtain them any other way & I much doubt whether you would   ever obtained them had I left them in Terre Haute I shall give you  information upon this subject from time to time as I write. I have not had  time as yet to look over his writings but little & do not know what there is  among them, but all of his corresponding letters with his Dear Sister & parents &   Azmon & myself & many other friends are among them there is many compo-  sitions of his own of interest among them I was particular to enquire of his  clerk & also Mr Smith concering his mind, his sickness, & death & I learn  the following particulars that he was considered one of the first & most respect-  able citizens of Terre Haute & his death much regretted    [upside-down text]  Wilford Woodruff to  Eunice Woodruff  giving the Acco[un]t of the death  of Ashael Woodruff  [end of upside-down text] 
 his clerk said to never find a more [page torn] task than to part with him he said  he never saw a [page torn] mind than his he also remarked that he was very absent minded  for several months before his Death cheerful most of the time but occasionly lost  in Deep meditation he spent muc^c^h of the time During his last months among his friends  in public at ^times^ almost to the neglect of his business this was a secret they could not account for (But  I could have told them that it was his mind upon spiritual subjects he was convinced of light & truth had none to  unbosom his feelings unto & mingled with company to pass away his time & c.) [None] knew his mind upon  religious subjects he was moral in all his conduct far from any thing leading to disruption  he often spoke of his friend, & [doted] much upon a visit from me he remarked when he was  taking sick that he feared he should not recover. he did not convers upon religious subjects  after he was takingen sick & I do not wonder at it for there was no spirit in Terre Haute  to receieve it I wonder how Asahels mind would have suffered him to have remained  there as long as it Did. the Land was as [page torn] the garden of Eden but a wicked barren  place spiritually. I wrote Asahel a Letter which he received just before his Death in  which my mind was much exercised I never felt like bearing stronger testimony to any  person than in that letter I little thought that it was my last testimony to him I  write a letter to him afterwards but it did not arive untill after his death There was  three Doctors attended upon Asahel During his sickness (which was 3 to many) I visited my  Brothers grave I felt solumn while viewing it poor man he had not a relative to attend  on his bed side or follow him to his grave I picked up some small stones from his  grave in memory of him I was sorrow that in the sale of his papers that some articles  of his clothing was not reserved but every thing of that nature was sold I have all of his  [former] account Books his journals compositions, his watch two silver thimbles  & pencils & penknife & c. you can make any enquiries of me by letter concerning  those things that you wish as soon as I can inform you where to direct a letter I  am sensible that Asahels Death will be deeply felt by you all he was a beloved  Son & Brother truly may the Lord comfort you all under this affliction. My Dear  Sister since Asahel is gone It has given me great consolation to meditate upon  the cause. you have persued continue faithful in the cause in which you are  engaged & you will receive a crown of Life! O that I can but meet my Sister  in the celestial glory the thought of it will sweeten my tri[a]ls on Earth. Do not  think that your Brother is Discouraged because of persecutions in the west. No God forbid  it is true a number of our worthy brethren have sealed their testimony with their Blood  of late, it is equally true that if it is the will of God your Brother is ready & willing to share the  same fate. I tremble not at the approach of Death it has no terror to me I may be called to  feel a Missourian's steel or lead for my religion if so & my work is Done I say amen, I am  ready to meet it you may hear of my Death, but by the grace of God assisting me you  shall not be pained with the intelligence that I have drawn back unto perdition I am  travling through the cold of winter with a wife & child which is severe at this time but I  endure these things patiently many of our Brethren are stoped at the Mississippi River beca[u]se  of there faith I may be stoped myself but I shall travel untill I am give me your  prayers Dear parents & Sister while Asahel sleeps in Death let me be consecrated to  live or Die for Christ. O glorious strength, O Blessed hope. If we do not meet on Earth if we   are faithful we shall meet in heaven. phebe wishes to be remembered to you als[o]  give our respects to all enquiring friends    Eunice Woodruff Your friend & Brother  Willford Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City,  April 21, 1880.    Ammon M. Tenney    Dear Brother:    I have tried to get time to write to you ever since I have reached Salt  Lake City, but have never been in a situation to give you any information for  the want of time and getting certain business done before the Council. Bro.  Taylor got a letter from J. W. Y. -[John W. Young]- saying that you had more  missionaries than was necessary at the Meadows to hold the claims so you was  going to put some of them into the Missionary field. I was glad to learn this.  If you have men to spare, the sooner the better. Bro. Young telegraphed that  you, Christofferson and himself were at Albuquerque to buy goods for a Co-op  Store, and he spoke about taking contracts on the Railroad for our people. If  the brethren could unite together and take a contract so as to pay, I think it  would be a good thing, so as to get their bread.    Now, concerning St. Johns. How is that a going? Bro. Hatch wrote me that  somebody was sent as an Agent to borrow 100 cows to make the first payment of  Bro. Flake. I was in hopes that the people who went there would be able to raise  that first hundred cows. I wish you would write to me an[d] let me know how matters  are at St. Johns, and what arrangements you have made for entering the land. I  have got the privilege from Bro. Taylor and Council to use all tithing stock  in the Territory to help pay for St. Johns, unless the brethren can occupy the  land and pay for it.    This may be used as a loan and repaid when the people pay; I shall write  to Lot and Jesse N. Smith and Richards of St. Joseph to unite with the tithing  stock what they can, for we do not want that purchase to fail and I want you to   call upon Christofferson of Round Valley, Bp. Hunt and Jesse N. Smith of Snow-  flake, Bp. Richards of St. Joseph and Lot Smith of Sunset, and Bp. Lake of  Brigham City to gather the tithing stock, and you use it for the payment on  that purchase as a loan, keeping a strict account of what tithing stock you  use for the purpose. I shall write to them about it.    I wish you would write to me as soon as you get this, and tell me how   things are with you, and what you have paid on St. Johns, and what the prospect  is. Tell me where the railroad is going and what the prospect is for our   brethren to take jobs on it, and what rate. Direct from W. Woodruff, Salt Lake  City, Utah Box 321. I feel anxious to hear from you, and want to know what  missionaries you have in the field and where, and any news I will be glad to   get.    My kind regards to Sister Tenney and all the brethren with you.    Your brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City  May 25, 1880    Mr. A. M. Tenney,  Dear Brother;    I received your two letters May 7 and 8, and ^they^ have been read to Bro.  Taylor, and we are all pleased that things are as well as they are with you.  A few items I wish to speak of. We sent word to the Priests and Bishops to assist  in paying for the purchase of St. John in case of necessity, but as they can have  no demand upon you until next November perhaps by that time there may be help  enough to pay for the place without borrowing the Church stock, at least it might  be well to let it rest until fall to see what position you will be in.    Concerning taking contracts on the railroad I think that would be well, but  I think the Presidents of the Stakes should be consulted and a Committee appointed  and some man chosen to make these contracts for the people who will do justice by  the people and not pocket one half the people's earnings by their lax^b^or. Of  course any man who takes these contracts on the railroad should be well paid for  his labors. But there is so much speculation in taking railroad contracts that  it wants to be well guarded. This work should be done through the Board of Trade  or a Committee appointed by the people. But one thing should be guarded against,  the Mormons should not underbid each other but get as much as they can for the  work. Our people should grade all the railroad that goes through our settlements  and if they act wisely they can get a good price for it. I think it would be well  to consult with Jesse N. Smith and Lot Smith on the subject, as the work will  have to be done by those stakes.    You will want to unite together upon that work, and all act honestly with  each other, and let each have what he earns. I think the grading of that rail-  road will give profitable business to many of our people.    Again Bro. Watkins gave me an account of some political or Elections matters  with you concerning sending the next Delegate to Congress. I want to say concern-  ing this matter. It is one of the most delicate things between this church and  the Gentiles. There should be no step taken by any of the Saints upon this subject 
 or pledges offered by any of the people without strictly consulting with Lot   Smith, Jesse N. Smith, the Bishops and leading Mormons of Arizona.    And the next Election we should have all the County Offices of Apache Co.  Our people have legal votes enough to carry it. My feelings would be to elect as  a Delegate to Congress one who would be the best man, (if there is any best) and  the one that would do us the most good; but the Mormons must all unite upon this  matter, there should be no divisions with any of the brethren upon this point.    With regard to your entry of the land of St. John, I have conversed with  Prest. Taylor and he thinks I should consult a lawyer upon this subject, and I  will send you instructions what to do Therefore take no further action until you  hear from me upon the subject. Perhaps we can enter a townsite under the Arizona  Laws, if not we will have to pre-empt. I do not want to trust to homestead, it  will take too long But we have got to have honest men, if we can find them, to  enter the land. But I will send you word as soon as I can get it.    There is another subject I was somewhat surprised at, that is the price of  the claim of the upper ditch, for I understood when you made the purchase that  you had all the water and land except a small upper ditch that Barths charged  cows for, and when there was a failure in the purchase the 50 cows was knocked  off. Now they want $7,500 for the purchase, which amounts to a bout two thirds as  much as all the first purchase—that is something I do not understand.    Still, we as a people ought to own all of the land and water we can get, as  we want as little mixture with the outside as we can help. I shall do what I can  to send men and means. But many who were opposed to going make but slow headway.  I have spoken to the brethren about appointing David Udell -[David K. Udall]- for  Bishop of St. John and have had no opposition to it yet.    I realize that you want more Missionaries to go among the Lamanites and I  will do what I can to help send men. I am glad you have good prospects for a crop,  and that you have a chance to turn in barley. I think it is a fair price.    How do the brethren do about holding the claims on the meadow? Remember me  kindly to J. W. Young if he is with you and say to him that I have written him   and shall write again soon.    Remember me to your family and all the Saints with you. I remain your  brother in the Gospel.    W. Woodruff 
 LeSueur    Salt Lake City—May 26, 1881    Elder A. M. Tenney,  Dear Brother: Your letter of March 11, 1881, is before me and I write to answer    it. I was glad to hear that all things were as favorable as they  are in the payment of the St. John purchase. We have called something like a  hundred men to go to St. John this season. How many will reach there I do not  know. I hope it will be occupied by the Saints, so that the Gentiles will not wish  to be there. I saw from a letter from Bishop Udall, that arrangements were made  to enter a good deal of the land in the purchase. This I was pleased to see for  I have considered this very important.    Now BrotheSr Tenney, concerning your remarks upon the railroad contracts, I  wish to say that the Presidency of the Church were not anxious for our people  to engage in the railroad business at all, but as so many were anxious to engage  in it, the Presidency and the Twelve both felt that it was important that some  of the Quorum should be appointed to go to Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado and  preside over the organization of our people in these territories who were engaged  in the building of these railroads, and Erastus Snow, B. Young, J. W. Young and  Jesse N. Smith were appointed a committee to go to these territories and organize  the camp, and to direct and control all contracts made upon that railroad and see  that all camps of the Saints attend to their prayers and observe the Sabbath and  to see that all labor get their pay. They received strict written instructions  what to do, and E. Snow and B. Young went to Arizona for that purpose, but nobody  complied with the instructions, and the consequence is that John W. Young was  called to Salt Lake City and the Twelve and the Presidency have sat for days in  investigating this subject, and the final decision is that John W. Young and all  the others must abide by their instructions and take counsel in the matter if  they maintain their standing in the Church of Jesus Christ of LatteSr-day Saints.    John W. Young has agreed to do this, to throw all of his contracts into  their hands and to carry it on under their united counsel. And I would advise you  and every other elder in the church, who are taking contracts upon that railroad,  who are employing the Saints to work under them, to do as John W. Young has done,  to take their counsel in these matters. If you are not satisfied with your  settlement with J. W. Young, I would advise you to have E. Snow and B. Young to  settle it between you.    Another subject I wish to speak upon and that is the Lamanite Mission.  I had a great deal of confidence in you in this matter, as you had the Spanish  and were qualified to labor there, and I was in hopes that you would be able to  carry that mission. But it seems that you are engaged in the railroad business  and I do not know whether you will ever by at liberty to do anything upon that  mission. You wished me to appoint somebody else to preside and you would work  with them, but I thought you the best qualified to preside over it of any one  there. But as you have resigned, I told Brother Snow to accept of your resignation,  if you could not attend to it, and appoint some one in your place so that the mis-  sion may not be given up, for I do consider the salvation of that people of more  importance than building railroads or getting rich.    I am always glad to hear from you. Remember me kindly to your family and to  Brother Udall, if you see him.    Your brother in the Gospel.    W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City   May 27, 1880    Ammon M. Tenney  St. Johns, Apache Co., Arizona    Dear Bro.    I have consulted with lawyers and friends about entering the St. Johns   purchase and after getting all the information we can, we have come to the   conclusion that the safest, best and cheapest way is to enter the land by   quarter sections. It is very difficult to enter a townsite and we have to pay   a good deal more to the Government and it takes all together too long to home-  stead.    If you have not used your entry right, I would like you to enter the   Quarter which is of the most value and then put trusty men to enter the rest.   Those who enter will have to claim a house or shanty of some kind, until they   pay for it, and get a Government title before they can deed to others. You   will want to find out the sections, stakes, half sections and quarter sections,   so as not to make any mistakes about the land you enter. All persons will have   to go to Prescott to enter the land.    You will want to learn the Township, Range Plot Section, so as not to   make a mistake in the entry.    I enclose a letter to J. W. Young, which I will not seal for I have an   order in it for several persons who paid tithing to J. W. Young, and they may be   with you, some of them. I want you to see that they have credit on the tith-  ing books, of whatever ward they may be in, as I do not know where John W. is,   I trust to you to send the letter to him.    I wish now to say that we decided in Council last night to send David Udell   -[ David K. Udall ]- to preside as Bishop at St. Johns., L. John Nuttall will notify   him. I have tried ever since I came, to get him appointed as Bishop of that   place, but I did not get it accomplished until last night.    I shall be glad to hear from you from time to time to know how you progress.   My love to your family and all the Saints with you and please excuse a short   letter now.    Your brother in the Gospel  W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City, May 31, 1880    Mr. A. M. Tenney,    Dear Brother:    I have just received your two letters and read them to Brother Taylor,   and our counsel is for you today, to those brethren who are at St. John, who   are taking land, that our counsel to them is to turn out in payment for the   land, oxen, horses, wagons, harness, or anything they have to help pay for it,   and not wait for the last day of payment.    I have written to you concerning the election. We want you to consult   with the presidents of stakes and their counsellors, the bishops and counsellors,   and all the people must unite together and agree whom they will vote for as   delegate to Congress, and then all write and vote for your county officers. The   Mormons have a great majority of votes in Apache County, and it is a duty they   owe to themselves to put their own men into office. You write to Lot and to   Jesse N. Smith and consult with them about it. The people must be united and   not divide in these matters.    I have already notified you that we have appointed David Wall, -[ David K.   Udall ]- as bishop of St. John and he has been notified of it. How soon he can   go I know not. You should reserve a good city lot and farming land for him.   You can ask him when he can come.    I am surprised that you have received so little pay on the purchase for   the number of men. All should understand that they cannot hold that land if   they do not pay for it, for it was bought for the Saints, but we expect them   to pay for it.    If you are likey to have trouble with the Apaches, you should all form   yourselves into a military company without delay and see that your arm and   ammunition are in good order and ready at hand.    I thought all matters were settled between Brothers Hunt and Hatch. They   agree(d) to settle and bury everything (the) night of the settlement.    I am now notifying some men at Box Elder City to prepare to go to St.   John. We will send men as fast as we can.    You need not call for any tithing stock to pay on the St. John purchase,   unless you are obliged to. I was sorry to hear that Brother Johnson had made   such a poor -[choice]- out of his settling. I told him to go to St. John. Men   who take counsel will be blessed. Those who do not will suffer.    I have only time to write a little this evening. My love to all.    Your brother in the Gospel, W. Wroodruff per J. J. 
 Sunset, Apache Co. Arizona   Feb. 19th 1880    To the Latter-day Saints in St. John District:    Bleoved Brethren:    We have met in council at Sunset, and taken into consideration the situation  of the town and land purchased by A. M. Tenney, and we have put a ^the^ price of the   farming land $8.00 per acre: and the City Lots at $25.00 on an average; and we  have named our town "St. John," for it is at St. John. And we wish it distinctly  understood, by the Saints who settle there that we do not expect to enter into  any speculation in the purchase of this country, for ourselves or our Brethren.    Our labors in these matters are for the building-up of Zion, and the settling  of the Saints. We have figured this matter as closely as we can, and we feel that  we cannot put the land and lots at any lower price. When the land and lots are sold  and the debts paid, if there is anything left, it will be returned, pro. rata, to  those who have paid for the land: and if we fall short of the payment, we consider  it right and just that those who have purchased the land, shall also pay, pro. rata.  to help pay the debt: but we expect the price set, will pay for the land. Bro.  Ammon M. Tenney was appointed to make this purchase, and we look to him to deal out  this land, both city lots and farming land, to those who buy: the payments to be  made to him. He is held responsible for the fulfilment of the contracts. We would  like all of the Brethren that he calls upon to assist him in any matter appertaining  to the settling of the place. We wish further to be understood that Brother Tenney  has been appointed to preside over the settlement of St. John, and to preside over  all meetings when he is present, until he is released from his responsibilities.  We also appointed Brother Tenney to preside over the Lamanite Mission; the the  reason that he has already opened the doors among many of the Eastern Villages,  and is quite well versed in Spanish.    We have also appointed Brother J. Allred to assist Bro. Tenney, under his  direction, and to preside over the meetings in Bro. Tenney's absence, until they  are more fully organized. And we wish all the Brethren who take land, to do what  they can, at once, to assist in the payment of the same. We have advised Bro.  Tenney in relation to the Missionaries associated with him, as regards their  raising grain for the season, concerning which he will instruct you.    W. Woodruff—John W. Young

President W. Woodruff  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:    I sent a copy of   the Liverpool Daily Post to Prest Snow,  F. D Richards & Bro Jno. containing a report   of the mobbing of some "Mormon" Elders,   through the report of a woman that   the Elders had decoyed away her daugh-  ter who had returned, with two children   and had to walk from Liverpool to   London &c. Well from advices received   from London we learn that the Elders   did not preach in that place, but   they held an open air meeting in Mile   End Road and had a splendid good   meeting and was listened to with a   good deal of attention. I suppose this   is the way the adversary is educating   his children to mob the Saints. In my   inquiries about copyright and the regis-  tering at Stationers Hall I have come ac-  cross the following—"A copyright extends   to 42 years." Elder C. W. Symons and   D. H. Snarr, who are laboring in London,   went to Stationers Hall and obtained the 
 following information—"The Doctrine and   Covenants was registered at Stationers   Hall, June 7, 1845, by Wilford Woodruff   of Stanley Buildings, Bath St Liverpool.  These brethren are searching to find out   the copyrighting of all our Church works.  They could find nothing of the Book   of Mormon. The officials at Stationers   Hall said if it was first published in   America, it could not be registered there.  They also assert that the Doctrine and   Covenants was registered June 7, 1845 and   published June 15, 1845 eight days after   being registered and therefore gives it no   protection. The charge for searching is   one shilling a letter, it being arranged   in letters. They searched through two   letters from 1840 to 1873. They could   not find The Book of Mormon or Hymn  Book. Prest Leaing is giving it his attention and   I hope before long to get all the information we   want. We are all well and rejoicing in the   truth. With kindest regards.

My dear brother:    I have just returned   from a very satisfactory visit to the Nottingham   Conference I left here on Saturday Afternoon 12.th inst  and was met at the Depot at Nottingham by   Pres Jno H. Hays and some of the Elders from Utah.  We held a Priesthood Meeting oin the everning. There   were fifteen Elders from Utah and several of the   local Presidents of Branches and local priesthood.  On Sunday we held three meetings. On Monday a   meeting with the Utah elders in the morning and in   the evening I preached at Hucknall Torkard. Yesterday   after visiting at Hucknall I went to Mansfield and   held a meeting Elders H. H. Shurtliff, H Y Tilley and   myself doing the preaching. We had a most excellent   time. This conference is in an excellent condition.  On Saturday last Elders L. A. Cannon, E. L.  Sloan and his sister left for Utah pr. Guion S.  S. Nevada. When we received your cablegram  we notified these brethren and on the following   day for the departure of a Guion Co. Steamship   they left for home. Bro.

 been away from home over two years and a quarter   was happy of the privilege of returning. The Lord has   kindly encouraged some of the brethren by giving   them some precious souls for their hire and seals   for their ministry that has caused them to rejoice   and take courage in their labors. I returned this   afternoon full of thanksgiving to God for all His   mercies received a most excellent letter from folks   ^at^ Nephi and rejoiced in His matchless love and   kindness. In Sundays Chronicle there is a piece call-  ed "Dying Mormonism" which I enclose that you   may see how the people are being educated (?)  with regard to the Work of God. How ready the peo-  ple are to believe false prophets. If the "recruits from   Europe" where as benighted and ignorant as this   "Travelling Correspondent", they may well be pitied.  These wiseacres speak as they would wish it to be,  but fortunately for the human family and the   righteous in particular it is Babylon that is   doomed and every plant that the Father has not   planted and not His Church or the Gospel of   the Kingdom. It is mail time and our ^Wednesday^ even-  ing meeting so I must conclude. I am happy   to report we are all well in health and spirits.  With kindest love to yourself, counsellors, bretheren  of our Quorum and those associated with you   I remain as ever    Your brother in patience  George Teasdale

In the company there are besides the returning mission-  aries, 63 adults, 36 children, and 5 infants, total   112 souls. PrestJ. U. Stucki came with the emi-  grants from the Swiss & German Mission.  Hise is  well. Last Sunday I met with the Elders and   Saints in the Welsh Mission in a Conference held   at Merthyr and we had a very profitable   time. The anti "mormons" tried to annoy and break   up our meeting, but signally failed. There were   20 Elders from Utah and we had an exceedingly 
 pleasant time in our Priesthood meetings.  Tomor-  row Sunday the 22nd we hold Conference at   Norwich. In our searchings after the copy right-  ing of our Church Works we do not seem very hap-  py but we discover enough to be assured of the   absurdity of the claim of the Pratt family.

My dear brother:    On Sunday last   I attended a Conference of the Saints in the   Leeds Conference which was held at Dewsbury   about 9 miles from Leeds. The Conference   House is at Armley, two miles from Leeds. The   only train we could use left Leeds at 6.45 a m   So we had to walk from Armley to Leeds in the   Early morning and it pouring down rain. We   got wet, it was cold and cheerless. When we ar-  rived at Dewsbury it was about 7.30, no   Saints in the town and the Hall engaged   from 10 a.m. SWe stayed in the waiting room   until Prest  Tuckett went to the Hall to Ascer-  tain if we could find a shelter until 10 a. m   as it was raining. It being Sunday morning   and but few trains running there was no   fire in the waiting room, we walked under the   cover of the station on the platform to keep ourselves   warm. Arrangements being made we went to   the Hall a fine cConcert Hall capable of holding   some thousand people, with side rooms for   cloak & hat rooms &c.

Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    Your favor of the   23rd ult was received and read with much pleasure   and I have deemed it wisdom to publish it in part   for the encouragement of the Elders that they may   redouble their efforts and work whilst the day   lasts. Prest Fjeldsted writes us under date of Sep. 21st  as follows—"It is with regret that I must inform   you that we are meeting with quite an oppo-  sition in the Aalborg Conference, as also oin   Bornholm, from which places now several   of the Elders have been banished so I have   for athe time being compelled to withdraw the   missionaries from Bornholm and send the   one (bro E. Kofford), under banishment, to Norway   where also a brother Nielsen from Aalborg   Conf[eren]ce had to go a few weeks ago, and now   Bro. C. K. Hansen, President of Aalborg Conf[eren]ce   is also banished and Bro L. C. Johnson expects   to get papers served on him in a few days,  but I have changed him to another Con-  ference so perhaps he can evade the officers   and remain in Denmark. The police are   also seeking after the other brethren now laboring 
 In the afternoon I explained why we partook   of the Sacrament and what we considered   essential before we could consistently do   so. Elder John B. Milner & his wife attended   Conference. Bro Milner spoke in the after-  noon for about half an hour and bore an   excellent testimony, was exceedingly interesting,   and listened to with rapt attention. We had   a fine successful conference seven Elders from   Utah Prest Hy Tuckett, Abraham Maw, Rosel H.   Hunter, Thos H. Blackburn, Wm J. Critchlow   Jno B. Milner & myself. Bro's A. Maw & Hunter   have been successful under the blessing of God   of organizing a branch in Hull and bap-  tizing twenty two souls. They have pretty much   to sustain themselves in that Conference, Saints   few and far between. When I returned to   42 I found your telegram relating to   Bro D. M. McAllister and must say I am   exceedingly sorry to part with him. I told   him he had better leave with this Company   on the 26th but he said he could not in   justice as he would have to see to all the   business connected with the Company but   he would leave the following Saturday  and then he would be able to arrive in 
 in Aalborg Conf[eren]ce and if found will of course   also be banished." Prest Fjeldsted also says—  "Outside from these troubles we enjoy peace in   the other parts of the mission and the brethren   are meeting with encouraging success in   various places." He also informs me he has   sent a native elder to Preside in Alalborg. We have   had some little encouragement also. Last Sun-  day I attended an excellent Conference of the   Norwich Conf[eren]ce. There was five to have been   baptized but through some misunderstanding   two men did not meet with the others, but   three were baptized and confirmed. In the   Scottish Mission also there have been some   baptisms. Next Sunday I expect to attend a   Conference of that Mission in Glasgow. We   have the half yearly statistical reports of the   Conferences of the British Mission and find   (193) one hundred and ninety three baptisms   (155) one hundred and fifty five emigrated (53)  fifty three excommunicated and (23) twenty   three died; a decrease of (66) sixty six to the mission   (3230) Thirty two hundred and thirty, officers and   members comprise the British Mission, good   & bad. We have just published our Book of Mor-  mon Ad broadcast, as much as to tell the people   what the Book of Mormon is as to make business   and so leave them without excuse. We have   sold some we should not have done if we 
 the City about as soon as they would.   When you send a cable gram to send   anyone home immediately I should let them   go without any regard to business. You know   I am a minute man, but I cannot force   anyone away. Bro Mac is a man of faith   and trust in God, he is as calm as a   summer's morning, and is turning over   the business every day to the understand-  ing of Bro L. R. Thomas, who has been as-  sisting in the office during Emigration,   and he is getting his things together to   pack up and leave as cheerful and   unconcerned as if it had been arranged   for him to go and there had been no   telegram. Bro. McAllister is a man of God   one of natures noblemen, humble faithful   and true. I have lived with him here   two years and a third and can say that   he improves upon acquaintance. We have   in the office with us at present Bro S. T.   Whitaker who leaves on Saturday for home   and a brother George F. Phillips a young  man of excellent family — as the world goes —  and good education. He is about 23 years   of age. His parents are Catholics, mother is dead, 
 had not advertized but not enough to pay us   in a financial point. We keep pushing our   business to try and sell books. Our next   venture is a cheap edition of the Hymn Book   so all our children and young people as   well as grown people, can have one for   one shilling. Our cheap edition of the Book   of Mormon for two shillings and our   Voice of Warning for sixpence has been   quite a success in spreading the know-  ledge of the gospel and the scriptures. The   blessing of the Lord has been with us.   He put it into our hearts to publish   these cheap editions and He has prosper-  ed us in our labors. I hope for the sake   of the work and of the people the elders   will not be withdrawn from the nations  until He says it is enough. There is a   pleasure in laboring for the Lord, in la-  boring for Zion, if it is uphill business,   or rowing against the stream, with all   its discouragement it has its lights and   shadows, its joys and sorrows. The exper-  ience the elders gain is invaluable in fact   it is priceless. It could not be gained under   any other circumstances. Elder W. P. Payne was 
 His grand father on his mothers side was a   Jew. He has always been religiously inclined   and educated in the Catholic Church speaks   French, Latin and is an organist, educated   to be a physician. He was assistant organist   at a Catholic Church. Of late he has been   dissatisfied with the Catholic Church and   had some interviews with a popular   protestant evangelist, but was disgusted   with the Come to Jesus declarations of this   gentleman and concluded the Catholic   Church was better than that. It happened   that the Priest of the Church where bro Phillips  was assistant organist saw him walking   with and in conversation with the Evan-  gelist, and one evening after vespers when   Bro P had been playing, the organist being   absent, the priest came to him and asked   him what he was talking to the evangelist   for, and Bro Phillips told him he was in-  quiring into his faith and principles. The   Priest sharply reprimanded him and   Bro P. defended himself and told the priest   he was far from being satisfied with the Catho-  lic Church. This added fuel to the fire, he was   told that to doubt was to be damned &c and en-  ded by cursing him and discharging him 
 unwilling to return he made a most excellent   missionary. And as a general thing all the   Elders say when spoken to about their release  or released—"Just as you say Bro. Teasdale" we   are in the hands of the Lord." This is the result   of intelligence, they know this is the Work of   the Lord that we are engaged in and that   theirre is an order in His Curhurch and feel safe   in sustaining that order. Your letter concern  ing the release of Bro. A Judd has been re-  ceived. We have telegraphed him for the   5th of October Company if he can get   ready. He will be missed in the Hol-  land mission. Bro. Brown writes me   he does not know what to do with the   last three missionaries who have been   appointed to Holland as they cannot speak   the language and it takes a year before   they can be of any service to the mission   He is in want of elders who can go into   the field and push the sale of the Book   of Mormon and be an immediate help   to him. Our good friend Mr Ramsden   has just apprized us of the accident   that happened to the Wisconsin Company   that Bro. W. P. Payne had charge of. Is it 
 from the situation of assistant organist. He   was occupying a position as assistant to   a physician as he was training for the   medical profession. One day he saw a   scrap of a newspaper with a letter from   a Mormon Elder writen on it. He had al-  ways believed the Mormons were a wicked   people. He was impressed to inquire about   them and he wrote to the Glasgow Mail to   make inquiry about the location of the   "Mormons" in Glasgow where he could gain   information concerning them and they  directed him to the "Millennial Star Office"   and he wrote for information. We sent him   some tracts and referred him to President   S. T. Whittaker. A correspondence was open   between them and Bro Whitaker let him   have some tracts and he got quite interested   One day he went out to visit a sick child   leaving one of the tracts on the desk. During   his absence the physician he was with   saw the tract and read some of it and   when Bro P. returned he censured him   exceedingly for reading such stuff   Bro P. defended himself and the princi-  ples advocated in the tract and this   led to the his dismissal from the physicians   employ. Up to this time he had not been 
 not wonderful that no one was killed or   crippled in such a terrible smash up? Sure-  ly it is another evidence of the matchless   love and power of God manifested in the  protection of His people. It is marvellous!   Mr Ramsden has also caused the Post to   insert another paragraph concerning   that canard they published about "Mob-  bing Mormon Missionaries" Mr Ramsden   says in a letter to me—"I sent one of the copies   of the "Star" to the Daily Post and asked them   not to give you the trouble of inserting   such articles for the future I think it will   do them good and make them more care-  ful in future."—Mr Ramsden is our true   friend. I often think if we were all as faith-  ful in our sphere as he is in his we would   all do pretty well. And this man cannot   see the truth as the Saints have the privilege   but if he was a member of the Church   he could not treat our people better   than he does. I should like to know if the   Post would have published that at our   request? I doubt it very much for it has   always been very bitter towards our   people. I am happy to say we are all 
 baptized he was only investigating read-  ing and attending meetings. When it   was known he was investigating and   likely to embrace the mormon faith it   caused the greatest consternation. The   priest was sent to reason with him   his father persuaded him but he stood   his ground got cursed by the priest and   disowned by his father. He had asked   for baptism but had been put off to   be more enlightened, count the cost &c   Bro Whitaker seeing what a cross he   was taking up was slow to baptize   him. However as there were some   converted to the truth who disired Bro.  Whitaker to baptize them before he left   Bro Philips was baptized same time. A   number of strangers were present at   the baptism and confirnation. Through   this step Bro Phillips father has turned   his back upon him, would not speak   to him not even to say good bye. They   kept his clothes. He came here with Bro   Whitaker to see me. He wrote me to say   he was willing to do anything the Lord   had for him to do. I saw him and 
 well in body and mind. We thank you   very kindly for your faith and prayers   and for the prayers of your counsellor's   and the Twelve, for they are certainly   answered. Jarman & Co are continuing their   lectures because there is money in it, but they   seem to have lost their influence. We are   letting them severely alone and this seems   the best way to do. The Lord is certainly   able to do His own work, and from the   very fact that He has allowed Jarman & Co.   to travel and vilify His people for so   many years is an evidence that it is   for a purpose hereafter to be developed.   With kindest love to the First Presidency,   The Twelve and all associated with you  and with continual prayers for your wel-  fare and blessing    I remain, as ever,  Your brother in the gospel  George Teasdale 
 conversed with him at the Conference of the   Scottish Mission, he was not in the Church then.   I had intended to let him go into the field   and labor to give him an experience but I   find him so useful that he has been assisting   us in the office this week. Your much valued   favor of the 25th ult came safe to hand and read   with much interest. I regret exceedingly that   you lent Bro. Galbraith any money. He was   going to work his way to Utah. He did work   his passage across the sea. He appeared to me   to have been brought into the Church for a   wise purpose in the Lord and seemed to be   an honest man. I should not have taken   the liberty to introduce him to you if I had   dreamed he would have taken an undue   advantage of the introduction. He expressed   himself as desiring to spend his life in the   service of God and teach the young, preach   the Gospel and labor anyhwere he might be   of use. I only wanted you to see him and   if you thought proper and there was a va-  cancy in some of the coutown or country set-  tlements where he gcould get an experience   after he had got located that he might have   the chance of it — But I am ashamed of having   written so long a letter so will conclude with  Kindest love from all to all your brother in the Gospel   Geo. Teasdale.

We telegraphed early   morning to Bro R.d Johnson and on Friday evening he was   here; went on board ship and left Liverpool, pr Guion S. S.  Arizona, on Saturday morning about 10 o'clock.    I have written to Bro. J. M. Sjodhal to stay until the   spring, and have released Prest. F. F. Hintze to re-  turn home on account of his being unwell, and   having been so long away from home. He will ar-  rive in Utah about the last of this month, or the early   part of next year. Bros. Stauffer and Simmons seem   settling down to work. Bro. Locander writes me he   has received blessings, enjoyments and satisfaction during   the past year far above anything he anticipated and   that he was content.    As this will reach you about Christmas, I shall   do myself the pleasure, of wishing you, your   counsellors, and the Twelve, a happy peaceful  Christmas, with your family and friends. May   the blessings of the God of Israel attend you   in all your administrations. Although I   am absent in body, I am with you in   spirit and in love, you all have my warm 
 affection, and fervent prayers, offered in the   warmest brotherly love, and deep desire for your   blessing and welfare; and that we may all   have the great privilege of overcoming and   enduring unto the end in the Church and   Kingdom of God, and obtain an inheritance   in the Kingdom of heaven.    Presuming that you have seen our Brother   D. M. McAllister, and that he has given you a   better discription of the condition of this miss-  ion than I can on a sheet of paper; I have   said little at this time, reserving what I   have to say until the end of the year. It is   an anxious time with us now, to know how   we are going to come out in our twelve months  work. When we send our yearly statement   I shall be pleased to give you further in-  formation.    May the blessings of our heavenly   Father be continued unto you, and all the   faithful of the House of Israel.

October 29th 1889.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    On Saturday   last, the 26th inst, a company of Latter-day Saints   left Liverpool, pr Guion S. S. Wyoming. There were   116 from Scandinavia, 24 from England,   6 from Holland, 3 visitors, 9 missionaries from   Scandinavia, and 3 from England, making in   all 161 Souls. They were under the presidency   of Elders A. L. Skanchy Prest, Ola Olson 1st, and   C. C. A. Christensen 2nd Counsellor and Secretary.   F. Jacobsen, Olaus T Nielsen, Julius Johnson,   Chas. K. Hansen, J. J. Nielsen, & Edmund Sanderson,   (the last named returning through sickness) from Scan-  dinavia and Samuel T. Whitaker, Samuel A Blair,   and Thomas Beard of the British Mission. Bro.   John B. Milner and wife and a Mrs. Brown   were the returning visitors. On Thursday evening,   the 24th inst, whilst we were holding a fellow-  ship meeting in the prayer room at 42 with the   returning missionaries and some of the Saints,   a number of missionaries arrived per Guion  S. S. Arizona. F. C. Mickleson, J. P. Olsen, John   Johnson & Ole Olsen for Scandinavia Orson Merrill   Edward Peay, Ezra C. Rich, Chas R. Lyman, W. B. Gibbons. 
 for the British B. Heertjes, for the Holland, and John   Schweizer, for the Swiss & German Missions. Those for   England are appointed as follows—E. C. Rich and   Chas R. Lyman to Birmingham, Edward Peay to   Leeds, W. B. Gibbons to Norwich and Orson Merrill   to the Newcastle Conferences. There were also   some visitors O. P. Arnold, C. S. Burton & wife,   T. Williams, Mrs Jane Ferguson & daughter   Mary and Mrs Morse sister in law to Bro Rd  Morse now presideing over the Welsh Mission.   There are some few persons left who wish to   emigrate, but who have not been able to get   ready with our companies; so to prevent anyone   being disappointed we have arranged to   send them on the 16th of November pr Guion   S. S. Nevada. Our Brother McAllister leaves   on Saturday per. Guion S. S. Arizona, and we   are exceedingly sorry to part with him. I wish   he could have finished up the year with us.   Bro L. R. Thomas, who has been assisting   us in the office during the emigration sea-  son, will hold the books until the successor   of Bro. McAllister arrives. He should be a good   accountant and business man. Bro Macallister   has been first class help, and he is a gentleman   and Latter-day Saint who appreciates the honor   and privilege of being a citizen of the Kingdom   of God and a standing in the Church of Christ,   which many do not seem to sense, I am sorry to say. 
 Brother George F. Phillips, of whom I wrote   you in my last of the 23rd inst, is still with us.   I have not had any conversations with him   but have let him take his own course. He   has been keeping in the office. He bore a very   good straitforward testimony on Sunday at   our testimony meeting, and seems to feel very   well in the Church. He has made covenant   with the Lord by sacrifice indeed. This is an   evidence to us how capable God is of per-  forming His own work and bringing the seed   of Israel into His fold. How many have been  led by a scrap of paper into His Church I see   by the papers that our Quorum has been fil-  led, which is a satisfaction to me because I   think at the advanced stage of the work   we ought to learn our duty to God and in-  quire of Him to know who He wishes to fill   vacancies. I recognize we are the Church   of Christ and the order of that Church.   You are the head of the High Priesthood—  the chief apostle of the Church of Christ and   have a right to the revelations of God. We   all sustain you as a prophet, seer and   revelator and ask God to reveal His mind  and will unto you that His will may be   done. We all want the will of God done not   ours or anyone elses' but His will. It is His 
 Church we are members of, He is our Father in   Heaven, our God and Redeemer, all we have   we owe to Him, all we ever expect to enjoy   we look to Him for, and it is natural we   should be jealous for Him, that He may be   sought after, inquired of, honored and   obeyed. He has established His Church and   He is going to extablish His kingdom with   those who love Him and delight to serve   Him, and who are jealous for Him. We have   been a Church long enough to know something   of the order of His appointing and for one   I say let His order be honored and let Him   be inquired of and He will direct. This is just   what we are all praying for that His will   may be done on earth as in heaven I say   Amen with all my heart because this is just   what I truly want to see. It matters little to me   whom the Lord calls, for I am a brother and   friend of every man who is a Latter-day Saint  in good standing and full fellowship in   the Church of Christ. There are so many good   and competent men to day who are capable under   the blessing of God of fulfilling any poition to which   they might be called, but they want to be just were  the Lord wants them and to do just what He wants   them to do and would not wish for any position   only as they are called by Him, knowing they   are all the same in His sight and their labors of   equal value all working for the same recompense. 
 of reward viz—Endless lives in His glorious   presence. If it is a strait and narrow way   it is open to all who love God and delight   to keep His commandments; members of   all quorums being equally honorable. For   it is not the position that makes the man,   or ^is^ a sureity of success, but it is the man   of God who is humble, childlike, true and   faithful, enjoying the fellowship of the Holy   Ghost, who makes the position an honor-  able one in any quorum or in any position.   The man who honors God is honored by   Him in whatsoever calling or responsi-  bility he is called to, Priests of the order   of Aaron often being blessed in a most   miraculous manner on account of their   faith and good works. I am thankful for   the men God has given us to be our com-  panions in our Quorum and hope we shall   be one with each other, and as a Quorum,   and with the First Presidency, that we may   be Christs', that we may be sanctified by   the Truth, and he the servants of God in   very deed. May the Holy Ghost be our con-  stant companion that we may all see eye   to eye and be a blessing to the House of Israel.   May we be humble and full of love possessing 
 faith, hope and charity, being temperate in   all things intrusted in our care, working   out our own salvation and laboring with   an eye single to the glory of God. This is my   prayer, and if I had the power to confer   a blessing upon the heads of my fellow ser-  vants ^this^ would be the blessing I would confer   upon all, with deepest love and fraternal   affection. God bless the First Presidency and   God bless the Twelve and unite them toge-  ther as the heart of one, to bless and be   blessed, and set a righteous example   to all quorums, and to all Israel for   brotherly love, humility, faith, hope   and charity to the glory of God the   Father is the prayer of His unworthy servant.   With kindest love to all    I remain as ever  Your brother & fellow laborer  George Teasdale.

Dear Brother:    On Saturday last   our Brother McAllister left Liverpool per. Guion   S. S. Arizona. Such sudden changes are never   very pleasant, especially with book keepers. When  your telegram reached us we were in the midst   of the business of shipping off a company of   Saints. Bro. Mc Allister has worked assiduously   to get his books posted up and in some shape   to hand over to Brother L. R. Thomas so that he   could hold them and carry on the business   until Bro. McAllisters' successor should be   sent. Bro Mc set up the whole of   Friday night working to have the accounts   in good condition. Bro. Thomas is doing very   well for a young man as you will see from   the Balance Sheets for October. As you will soon   see Bro. Mac he will give you quite a history of   our doings and hand you a very handsome-  ly bound large sized Book of Mormon for   the Tabernacle and a Psalmody. We furnish   the unbound copies and Mr Fazackerly binds   them free of charge. They are exceedingly   handsome and will be a pleasant souvenire 
 from old 42 Islington and our friend Fazackerly.  Your greatly esteemed favors of Oct 19 and 17th   have come safe to hand. The reason why Elder   L. A. Kelsch did not go to Turkey was because he   could not get a passport. It is no use anyone   coming here without a passport, for they cannot ob-  tain one in this country. Bro. Kelsch tried all he   could and made it a subject of prayer but was   refused and that is why we put him into the field  He wrote home to try and get a passport but failed  So we have appointed him President of the Bris-  tol Conference where he is laboring at present.  I have received letters from J. M. Sjodahl and   W. H. Smart wishing to be released from the   Turkish Mission through sickness. Bro.  Smart writes that Bro Socander is down   sick also. I enclose their letters and shall   be pleased to know what to do. A few days   ago I sent (£6.0.0) six pounds and an en-  couraging letter to Bro Sjodahl. Bro. W. H.   Smart has never had much faith in the   mission since he has been there. Bro Stauffer   is the only one who seems to be really doing   anything. The last letter I got from Bro   Hintze he seemed to be doing but little in   Constantinople. He wanted £10.0.0 to get some   letters or articles into the Newspaper as he could   not get any printing done. With kind regards   Your brother in the gospel George Teasdale 
 Br. Woodruff. Mothers, Daughters, and Sisters in Zion,  I feel happy to have the privilege of meeting with you, but   think it a difficult matter to speak to such a congregation.    It requires the spirit of God to speak and teach the sisters   in their duties. God has taken the weak things of the world   to confound the wise. Said that Joseph Smith   organized the Female Relief Society as he did the church   by revelation; that when he did organize this Society, he   had an object in view; so also did the Lord.    Spoke on fore-ordination: clearly showing that the Lord   known unto his servants, those things that should come   to pass down to the present day. The Lord has   prepared people to carry on His purposes that would   not be thwarted. Said the Lord had foreordained that   these mothers should come forth in this day and gen-  eration to raise up a people to carry on His work.    That they had a mission just as important as the   Brethren, but they must be co-workers with each other.   Spoke at some length upon the sisters having the power   to controll the fashions; did not care how beautifully   we dressed, so that it was of comly and home-made.   Encouraged the sisters to cooperate in these things untill   we become independent of Babylon. Referred to Brigham   City as an example in cooperation.    Spoke at some length on selk culture, and showed   the nescessity of cultivating the mulberry tree, and encouraged   the sisters to enter into this with a will. Also spoke of the   laying up of grain, in case of famine—for it will surely   come. Spoke of the power the sisters have in assisting   to build temples and gather the poor. Spoke of the   responsibility resting upon mothers in bearing children   and training them to bear of this Kingdom.    Said there is many trials attending the principle of   Prural Marriage, but there is also the greatest blessings   attending the same. Made some very pleasing remarks   on this subject. Asked the blessings of God on all. Amen.

April 15th 1890    President Wilford Woodruff  and Council.    Dear Brethren:    On the 6th of April  I attended a very good Conference of the Scot-  tish Mission. Our priesthood meetings and  assembly of the Saints were attended very  satisfactory and an excellent spirit prevailed.   Last Sunday I attended the Newcastle  Conference and had quite a number of  strangers attend. Although but few baptisms  the Elders have much joy in their labors.   Last week Elders Carlisle, Fraser, the Young  Brothers and others arrived and received their  appointments as you will see from the Millennial  Star9. On Saturday the 12th inst. Elders W. H.   Smart and Richard Yeates left here for  home per S. S. Alaska    Your favor of March 22nd received. I had read  in the Deseret News that two dollars was to be al-  lowed the passengers from New York to Utah for  provisions, and could not understand it, but  your letter explains that this two dollars is to help  pay provisions on the railroad and incidental  expenses." I am afraid this will cause some  confusion. If two dollars is to be returned to the 
 passengers, would it not be easier to charge  them $60 sixty dollars and thus save any fur-  thur trouble. The presidents of the Companies  have much to do already and to have the  responsibility of giving every passenger two  dollars at New York or a part of two dollars  after some necessary expenses have been paid  will increase his labors and make him a tar-  get for the passengers to accuse and find fault  with. I think we should do all we could to  prevent confusion and guard against giving  room for complaint. I was sorry when I read  the notice in the News that two dollars was  to be spent in provisions. If it had been sixty  dollars for the fare and understood as here-  tofore they have to provide themselves provis-  ions over the R Road, they do it. But if they  know two dollars is to be given them at New  York for provisions they will think that  is sufficient for the journey and look to  the President to provide them. He has had  to do this ^for some^ on several occasions in the past and  have so reported to this office. We have to deal  with a jealous people and it is a thankless  position to have to serve them. I have had  an experience with them for years and   have not wondered when men apostatised  because of the people. The best way to handle  them is strait and give them no chance for

Evans and David T Lewis, of the Welsh Mission   and Edward Richins, of the Bristol Conference,   left Liverpool, per Guion S.S. Nevada, for home  having to return through ill health, and at   the recommendation of their Conference Presidents.  On Sunday last I attended a Conference of the   Irish Mission at Belfast. There was only four   baptisms reported in the last years statistical re-  port. But since last Conference held there has been   12 baptized. The brethren are very energetic 16,700  tracts had been distributed, 17 Book of Mormon, sold, and   8 loaned, 4 presented to the public library. 118 of the cheap  edition of the Voice of Warning had been sold, and 31 loaned,   4 presented to the public library. 33 open air meetings held.  This is a good showing when we take into considera-  tion there are only 62 members & officers in the miss-  ion including 7 Elders from Utah, one of these, Elder Lewis   Hunt, of Snowflake Arizona, was released to go home   on May 24th. This week Elder Hans Hansen Jr,  who arrived here Saturday April 26th with the miss-  ionaries appointed to Scandinavia, returned to this   office. He stated he was sick and could not stand

Dear President Woodruff:    Your letters of Nov   25th, 26th, and 29th all came to hand on the   same day, and were read with indiescribable  feelings, Iand I have suffered more than I can   express, because of my affection for you. With   regard to Thomas Galbraith I am sorry for   him because he has been over come by the   power of the adversary. I am satisfied he   had a desire to serve God. He was going to   work his way to Utah. He never asked me   for any money. When I found he was deter-  mined to go I thought the matter over and   talked it over with Bro. McAllister and the  brethren here. One morning, before I said   anything to Galbraith, I told the brethren   I had concluded to offer him a loan to   help him across the continent, for I thought   he was honest. He had been told he would   have to meet difficulties, that he was going   to a new country where he was unknown and   he would meet with people who would en-  deavor to poison his mind, to discourage him   and lead him out of the Church; but he   was prepared for this he had read a great   deal against the people, but he knew he

April 19th 1890.    President Wilford Woodruff,  and Council.    Dear Brethren:    A small company,   the first of the season, left here this morning,  per Guion Steam Ship Wisconsin, under the   presidency of Elder Orson H. Worthington, with   Edward A. Cottrell and Daniel H. Snarr as   his counsellors, and Thos. E. Bassett clerk and   recorder. The following named brethren returning   missionaries, Timothy B. Davis, Jenkyn Thomas,  T. E. Ricks Jr, Joseph H. Ward and E. L.  Burgoyne. The company consisted of 43 souls  without counting the missionaries. 32 full fares 4   halves 6 between 1 & 5 years and 1 infant = 43 souls 9 missionaries   = 52. 19 were for Salt Lake City, 7 for Ogden, 2 for Nephi   7 for Provo, 1 for Evanston, 11 for Market Lake Idaho, 3   for Farmington, 1 for Logan, and 1 for Montpellier = 52.  As we have received no advices concerning the   fares north of Ogden and South of Spanish Fork,   we have been obliged to guess at it, and have ad-  ded the difference we paid last year to the places   north of Ogden and South of Spanish Fork not knowing   what better to do. According to your instructions we   have made out the lists at $45.25/100 fortyfive dollars   and twentyfive cents and opened an account with 
 had a work to do, and was willing to devote   himself to the service of the Divine Master, and   prepared for the difficulties and quoting scrip-  ture, with which he seemed to be familiar, that   the Saints would have to suffer tribulation.  When I spoke to him I told him I thought him  an honest man, and had come to the conclu-  sion to loan him sufficient to pay his overland   journey personally. I told him I did not know   why I did it, because I had little faith in men,  my experience had taught me that there was a  great deal of dishonesty in men, and that he   need not thank me, but thank God who had   softened my heart towards him to take a   step I was not in the habit of doing. I told   him the difficulties he would have to meet   with, and that he had to establish a character   amongst a people who would naturally   look upon him with suspicion, because   so many frauds had imposed upon them,  that they wanted to know men before   they were willing to invite them into their  families. Galbraith heard me lecture to a   Scandinavian Company, who were leaving   here for Zion, telling them in my plain flat-  footed way, what they might expect and   the experience they would meet. And he   said to me, no one could misunderstand   that, and he was struck with the disposition 
 suspicion or to think they do not receive what  they ought to receive and accuse an innocent  man who happens to be their servant.   I know you will pardon me for this suggestion.   I only know to honestly give you my views  which are the result of my experience and   submit them to your consideration, and  then I shall do just as you say. With  this company that leaves here on Saturday  next, the 19th inst, we shall give the President  of the company two dollars for every adult  passenger to pay expenses and furnish  some provisions. We shall instruct the  brethren with him to assist him all in their  power. We have done so on previous occa-  sions and have received word from the   President of the Company that after they  left Liverpool they took no further in-  terest than to look after the Saints they  were more immediately interested in. It  is not all men who are willing to put them-  selves out of the way for the convenience   of others. I would suggest that if the pass-  engers are to have a rebate of two dollars  that it be given them here, on their leav-  ing, and so save the President of the Com-  pany, who has all he can attend to with-  out this extra responsibility. I am sure the 
 the climate and he wanted to go home. We let him   have the means to go as he was without and has   promised faithfully to send it back to me as soon   as he returns home. The Guion S.S. brings us a few   missionaires and visitors. They landed here this morn-  ing. The following are their names and appointments   Thomas H. Woolford, to the London Conference   Geo H. Robinson and Ether E. McBride to the Liverpool,   Geo. Hanks, to the Bristol; Samuel Worsencroft, to the   Manchester and Joseph Newbold to the Nottingham   Conference; Jos S. Douglas to the Irish Mission.  H. H. Akert for the Swiss & German, Ola Jenson L   Dahlquist, L. J. Hernstrom, C. Olsen and Joseph   R. Olsen for Scandinavia. Bro. Wm Langton and   wife, Francis T. Bailey & wife, Captn J. D. Wright Doug-  las Watson, Brother H. H. Thomas' wife and others   whose names I have not yet got. All are in good   health & spirits. They came by the S.S. Wisconsin and   arrived to day. All but the missionaries have left for   their destinations or friends where they are visiting.  Bro J. E. Carlisle met with an accident which has   somewhat lamed him. He was jammed between a   tram and cab and bruised considerably. I am happy   to say he has almost recovered. We learn from the papers  through their American telegrams that "A consignment of Mormons   landed at New York (14th) yesterday It is believed that these peo-  ple are nothing more or less than contract laborers and   it is the intention to raise that point when the next batch of  Mormons is landed"—This is going the rounds of the press. We are all  well at 42 & join in love. Your brother    Geo. Teasdale. 
 Mr R. Tenbroeck at these figures and have mail-  ed him names and lists of full and half fares  so he can have the tickets ready for the company   on their arrival. We cabled you to-day—"Fifty   two sailed send Tenbroeck 1770—" The account figured   at $45.25 for Passengers and missionaries was $1990.04  We sent by Prest Worthington $22000 and cabled you for   1770 00/100 making $1990.04. We also gave the President   of the Company (8600) Eighty six dollars to pay any   necessary expenses and furnish some provisions on   the journey. As an evidence of how this is understood   he asked me if it could be used for provisions for   the returning missionaries, or tipping the saloon   stewards. To handle this emigration business re-  quires experience. I do not know how we would   have got along if we had a large company. It took   the brethren all their time to manage this small   company and sit up all night to do it, and they   are good bookkeepers but not used to this busi-  ness. With new hands on everything I am getting   an experience in patience. Mr Ramsden is as   kind and considerate as ever. Our returning mis-  ionaries all had saloon passage, one of them the odd   one, a cabin to himself. According to your wish we sent   Bros. Ricks and Bassett, two good missionaries. There   is a call for good help in nearly all the Conferences to   fill the place of those leaving. With kind love to all  I remain faithfully yours in the Kingdom of patience    George Teasdale 
 Scandinavian brethren would have pre-  ferred the fare being 6000 or 6100 sixty or   sixty one dollars and all expenses paid and  find their own provisions, than the rebate  Of course you may have some idea   that assures you of the wisdom of the  rebate that I am unacquainted with,   for I do not assume to have much  wisdom, I think sometimes I am very  dull of comprehension and wish I had   more wisdom and prudence, and  could see with clearer judgment. Yet  I do the best I can to my poor ability  and regret it is so poor.    I am happy to say we use  all reasonably well; The last attack  I had gave me a severe shaking, but  I am getting along wonderfully. We  have had of late many evidences of  the power and goodness of God in  healings and blessings, and glorify  His Holy Name. The brethren in the  office always desire their kindest re-  gards whenever I write. Bro. Thomas  is improving in health. Bro Carlisle  is taking hold of his labors. Bro Hoge  is doing well &   Bro Phillips is a help to me.    With brotherly love  I remain as ever yours  George Teasdale. 
 to truthfulness as to the real state of affairs in Utah.  Prest Woodruff you know we never offer any in-  ducements, outside of the gospel of Christ. We  tell the people in Christ they will have peace  but in the world tribulation. No Elder ever of-  fered any inducement to T. Galbraith to go to Zion   by "false and cruel arguments." He went be-  cause he wanted to go, and all the promises   of tribulation, persecution and difficulties,  could not deter him from going. He deceived   us all. We all thought him an honest man:  he possessed a testimony and enjoyed the   Spirit of God, and God has been his friend   and would have established him in His   righteousness if he had not turned his back   upon Him. Dear Brother Woodruff, there is   nothing I have done I regret in this business   except giving him an introduction to yourself.  I humbly ask your pardon for so doing. It   was done in haste without reflection and I   cannot excuse myself. It is the first time I   have been guilty of this unwarrantable   liberty, you may depend upon it being the   last. The suffering I have had in this unfor-  tunate experience will certainly be a warning   to me to never repeat it. The loss of the money   advanced him I count a light thing. My suf-  fering arises from the knowledge that an act of

We are pleased  to receive your instructions relative to our em-  igration, and shall communicate with Mr  R. Tenbroeck at once. When our companies  leave we always send a list of numbers  of fares and half fares and destination to  the agent at New York.

Dear Brother:    Your cablegram   of the 17th inst, to "release Robert Hodge return im-  mediately," was received, and to-day he has left   Liverpool, in company with Bro. J. S. Morris, who   has been laboring in Wales in very poor health;   and upon the recommendation of Prest Alma M  Matthews has been released to return home. They   left this morning per S. S. Nevada. On the evening   of Wednesday 18th inst Elders Samuel A King from  Fillmore, and Fred.k Wyss and John Teuscher of   Salt Lake City, arrived here per Guion S. S. Alaska.  Bro S. A.

I have found   a correspondence between T. Galbraith and   Bro. McAllister which I have had copied  and forward you by this mail.

 ance to us since he has been here. He is growing in-  to the knowledge of the gospel, bears his testimony   and is very humble and willing, does not expect   any salary, and willing to go and preach the   gospel. He is astonished at his own conversion,   because he knows it has not been by the power,   logic, or wisdom of man, and is convinced that   the Lord has brought him into His Church and   given him a testimony for some purpose and de-  sires to fulfill anything He has for him to do.  He has had quite a struggle with opposing in-  fluences the pleading of his friends, and the   change from having all the money he wanted   to be without anything. We have not encoura-  ged him at all or taken him into our con-  fidence. We gave him 20/- to go home as he   had been here some time and was feeling ra-  ther blue and I thought if he had the means   he would return, that perhaps he was to proud   to ask his father after he had been so treated by   him. But he did not go, and afterwards I learn-  ed his sister had sent him word, she presumed   he was cured of his folly by now, having found   us out, and discovered what kind of people we were,   and if he wished to return she would send him what  money he wanted. He has been quite a help to us since   Bro. Brookbank has been sick. But if you would ra-  ther that he should not work here, that is enough he will   leave. With love, I am your brother,    George Teasdale.

Brown came in with the emigrants from  Holland some 22 souls.    We read in the daily papers that it was the inten-  tion of the government to raise the point of the  "Mormons" being contract laborers when the next  batch of "Mormons" arrived so I wrote to Mr Ten-  broeck on the subject. Your telegram came safe  and was attended to. Prest Brown informs  me he has written you about missionaries.  By one of the returning missionaries he sent  you a copy of the Book of Mormon in Dutch

President Wilford Woodruff  & Council:    Dear Brethren:    A company of  Saints from the Scandinavian & Swiss & German  Missions left Liverpool today per Guion  S. S. Wyoming in charge of Elder Erastus  C. Willardson, with Elders James Poulsen as  his first and Henry Wintch as his second coun-  sellors, and J. M. Sjodahl clerk and recorder. The  names of the other missionaries returning are  as follows—Elders John Dahlquist from the  Scandinavian, and Henry Brandley, Godfrey  Lienhard, Angus J. Cannon, Wm L. Hansen, & Fredk  Inebrint from the Swiss & German Mission John J.   Carlson from the Scandinavian and John Hays from  the British Mission. 12 returning missionaries in  all, 170 souls from Scandinavia, 94 from Swiss and  German 8 from Holland and 8 from the British  Mission Total 292 souls. 169 full and 52 half  fares. We telegraphed you this evening and called  for 2000 dollars to be sent to Mr. Tenbroeck. The  returning Missionaries and Saints were very  comfortably situated. Last Sunday I attended  a very good Conference in London which was well  attended. I am satisfied a good work is being    169 + 52 = 221 
 It is very han[d]somly bound. Prest Brown is  pushing the gospel in Holland, he wants  more capable help. When the language  has to be learned it is sometimes twelve to  eighteen months before the Elders can preach  the gospel. He wants some help now. The  last missionary Elder H. C. Gelderblom does  not seem to take very well with his countrymen.  The work in England is rather discouraging  in baptisms and the indifference of the people.  At a District Meeting held in the Manchester  Conference, there was a good attendance. Next  Sunday I expect to attend a Conference of the  London Conference. We are having a number  of visitors. Elder John W. Young his son Willie  and David H. Cannon. They are in London at  present. Bro Wm Langton & wife are in Manches-  ter R. F. Neslen in Lowestoft all expect to be  in London on Sunday, with several of the Utah  Elders and other visitors. Prest G. Q. Cannon  has telegraphed for Angus to return first steamer  He was expecting to leave by the June 7th Com-  pany but we are trying to have him leave by  the "Arizona" next Saturday. We are all pretty  well considering. We have just received the news  of the death of Elder James Picton of Nephi which  has been very much of a shock and surprise to  us. With kind love I remain as ever    Your affectionate brother  George Teasdale. 
 the Liverpool, and B. S. Hunt to the Nottingham   Conferences. The brethren have all left for their   various fields of labor, after a pleasant visit in   Liverpool and to their friends.    I have returned from seeing the Scandinavian   Company off. This is our second company of the   season. There are 144 emigrants and 8 returning   missionaries, also an English family of 4 persons   making in all 156 souls. This company is in charge of   Elder Adolph Anderson with L. Ernstrom & G. S. Bastian   as his first and second counsellors. Ole Petersen, of Brigham City   N. C. Lund, of Ogden, Niels Anthon, of Spanish Fork, L. P. Niel-  sen, of Montpelier, & A. G. Erickson of Sale Lake City. We tele-  graphed you to day "156 sailed 81 full 32 half send Tenbroeck   4300." There are 148 souls without the missionaries, 74 adults,   32 half fare, 35 between 1 and 5 years, and 7 infants. = 148 and   8 missionaries = 156. Brother Anderson has his wife and   children along. His wife was only booked to New York to   see if she could get a pass over the line. Mr Ramsden   made Bro. Anderson & family exceedingly comfortable.   The Elders all had a cabin passage and were exceeding   well pleased. Your much appreciated favor of the 12th   ult. came safe to hand and we have deemed it wisdom   to publish most of it in the "Star"; so that all the Elders   may know your mind concerning them. I am grate-  ful to be able to report we are all well at 42 and   doing as well as we can under the circumstances.    With kind love   Your brother   George Teasdale    The Guion S. S.

 done and we shall reap the fruits if we faint  not. I regret to have to report Elders A. Maw  and Dalrymple of the Newcastle Conference  so indisposed as to warrant their return  home with the June Company of the 28th  if not before. It seems as if there was  a warfare against the good earnest work-  ing Elders. You can tell that by the num-  ber who return through sickness. President  Stucki is with us. He came with this Com-  pany of Saints. They were well treated  all along the journey. Mr. Ramsden  exercises his influence in our behalf  all along the route and our emigrants  receive very kind treatment. I hope we  shall soon have some good mission-  aries to help out so many going home.  Good missionaries are in demand every-  where, who can preach the gospel.    We are all well at 42; just  got through house cleaning. We had a  visit from the sanitary officers who are  very strict in regard to cleanliness and  doing everything to preserve the health of  the people. All here join in kind love  and pray for you morning and evening  at our family alter; patiently waiting for  the redemption of Zion, and laboring quietly  on for the recompence of reward.

 New York, Sept. 14th [18]56.    Elder Woodruff,    Dear Bro: On account of my absence   from Washington I only received your letter of the 31st  July at this  place the day before yesterday. I am exceedingly thankful  for the general information your letters contain and am indeed grate-  -ful for the better prospects of harvest announced in your last.  I have remained here for the last month expressly to get Elder  Taylor to complete his account of the Murder of the Prophet.  He is so buisy that it has been with difficulty that he has  been able to bring his mind to the task and remain at   it. I am, however, extremely satisfied with the prospects  of accomplishing the work. He thinks Dan Jones' statement  of the dreams ought to be considerableed reliable. From  many conversations I have had with Bro. Markham  in relation to the subject I have formed the opinion that his  memory is so treacherous that he would unwittingly mix  other circumstances with those attending Joseph's ass-  assination. His statements would therefore require criticism  Elder Taylor is bothered for dates of days & hours.    Since I wrote you I have visited  your native State  an account of which the boys will find in the Mormon.  I am greatly obliged to Bro. Bullock & the clerks in the office  for keeping me posted on the affairs at home and thank you  kindly for the attention to my fruit trees.    I expect to go to St. Louis just as soon as Elder  Taylor finishes his narrative of the conversation between  the Governor & the Prophet, &ce.    I preached last Sunday here and according to  the announcement of the brethren in to-day's Herald I  am to lecture this evening on "Utah and the present  position of the Mormons."    Heywood has returned to Washington and has better  prospects of winding up his business affairs and hopes to 
 return to Utah this season yet. Appleby is attending  a "Wood's Meeting" to-day in New Jersey. Elder Taylor  is at this moment going a head with the Governor's  conversation    The political atmosphere is as usual cloudy  and betokens storms. The spirit of dis-union  is rampant and "Bleeding Kansas" is the principal  capital for the Republican party: and a battle  has to be fought every week to keep up the exite-  ment.    Neither Elder Taylor or myself has received  any letters from our families by the August mail    I think you will find Elr. Taylor's account  of Governor Ford's conversation with Joseph a  splendid affair.    Please give my kindest regards to the  clerks in the office I hope that by this time they  have something better and more substantial than  barley-meal.  Perhaps you would say a   word or two of my family in your communications  so that if I fail to obtain their letters I may learn  something of their whereabouts.    With best affection for self & family  I am, Yours faithfully,    Geo. A. Smith.    [sideways text]  George A Smith  New York Sept 14th  Answd April 1th 1857  [end of sideways text]

 And the weakest of all Saitns wh  are or can be called Saints. Behold  verily thus saith the Lord unto yo  u in consequence of evils and desig  ns which do and will exist in the  hearts of conspireing men in the  last days I have warned you and  forewarn you by giving unto you  this word of wisdom by revelation  that inasmuch as any man drink  th wine or strong drink among  you behold it is not good neither  meet in the sight of your father  ownly in assembling yourselves  together to offer up your sacram  nts before him. And behold this  should be wine yea pure wine  of the grape of the vine of your own  make. And again strong drink  are not for the belly but for the  washing of your bodies. And aga  tobacco is not for the bodey neither 
 for the belly and is not good  for man but is an herb for  bruises and all sick cattle to be  used with judgement and skill  And again hot drinks are not for the  body or belly. And again verily  I say unto you all wholesome herbs  God hath ordained for the constit  ution nuture and use of man  evry herb in the season therof and  evry fruit in the season therof. All  those to be used with prudence and   thanksgiving Yea flesh also of   beast & of the fowles of the air of the  Lord hath ordained you the use of   man with thanksgiving Nevertheless  they are to be used sparingly & it is   pleasing unto me that they should no  be used ownly in times of winter 
 Or of cold or famine All grain  is ordained for the use of man  & of beasts to be the staff of life  not ownly for man but for   the beasts of the field and the  fowles of heaven and all will  animals that run or creep on  the earth and those hath God made  for the use of man ownly in tim  es of famine and excess of hu  nger All grain is good for the  food of man as also the fruit of  the vine that which yieldeth  fruit whether in the ground or  above the ground Nevertheless  wheat for man and corn for  the ox and oats for the horse and  rye for the fowls and for swine  and for all beasts of the field and  barley for all useful animals and 
 for mild drinls as also other  grain. And all saints who rem  ember to keep and do these sa  yings walking in obediance  to the commandments shall  receieve heath in their na  vel and marrow to their bones  bones and shall find wisdom  and great treasures of knowle  dge even hidden treasures &  shall run and not be weary and  shall walk & not faint and I the   Lord give unto them a promise  that the destroying angel shall pass  by them as the children of Israel  and not slay them Amen 
 Songs of Zion  Age after age has rolled away  Since man first dwell in mortal clay  And countles millions slept in death  That once supplied a place on earth    According to the fate of man  Which God had fix'd in his own plan  So age must come and age must go  Till worth complete is here below    Which had been seen by saints of old  And by the prophets were foretold  Which wondrous things are drawing near  That Enoch saw and saints did cheer 
 Enoch who did convers with God  Stood on the mount and stretchd abroad  His soul wide as eternity  He rent the vail and wonders see    With mighty faith he did expand  O'er earth and heaven o'er sea and land  Till things above and things below  He did behold yea did them know    His heart he turn'd to notes above  His soul o'erwhelmed with boundless love  He sang a song in heav'nly lays  While angels tongues join'd him in prais    With finger end God touch'd his eyes  That he might gaze within the skies 
 His voice he raised to God on high  Who herd his groans and drew him nig    With joy and wonder all amaz'd  Amid the heavenly throng he gaz'd  While heavenly music charmd his ear  And angels notes remov'd all fear    Hosanna he aloud did say  To God who dwells above the sky  Again Hosanna did resound  Among the heavnly hosts around    His voice he rais'd in higher strain  Echo'd and re-echo'd again  Till heaven and earth his voice did hear  Eternity did record bare 
 The trump of God around the throne  Proclamed the power of God anon  And sounded loud what stand take place  From age to age from race to race    Among the heavenly hosts he sang  God's scheme of life for sinful man  And for the gospel's saving grace  He prais'd the Father face to face    The end of all his labors here  were all unfolded to him there  His city raised to dwell on high  With all the saints above the sky    He was before him all things past  From end to end from first to last  Yea things before the world began  Or dust was fashioned into man 
 The place of Adams first abode  While in the presence of his God  Before the mountains rais'd their heads  Or the small dust of balance weigh'd    With God he saw his race began  And from him emanated man  And with him did in glory dwell  Before there was an earth or hell    From age to age whate'er took place  was present then before his face  And to the latest years of man  Was plain before him heav'ns plan    His eyes with woner did behold  Eternal glories yet untold  And glorious things of latter time  Which angels have to tell to men 
 He then did hear in days of old  The message that to John was told  The angel which the news did bring  He herd him talk and herd him sing    And knew before the days of John  What glories were on him to dawn  The message which he did recieve  He herd and saw and did believe    He knew full well what John should hear  Concerning times and latter years  When God again should set his hand  To gather Israel to their lands    The gospel then from darkest shades  Should rise and go with rapid strides  Till nations distant far and near  The glorious proclamation hear 
 The angel that this news proclaims  Should come and visit earth again  commit the gospel long since lost  To man with power as at the first    THE great and glorious gospel light  Has usherd forth into my sight  Which in my soul of lane receivd  From death and bondage being freed    With saints below and saints above  Ill join to praise the God of love  Like Enoch too I will proclaim  A loud Hosanna to his name    Hosanna let the echo fly  From pole to pole from sky to sky  And saints and angels join to sing  Till ^all^ eternity shall ring 
 Hosanna let the voice extend  Till time shall cease and have no end  Till all the throngs of heaven above  Shall join the saints in songs of love    Hosanna let the triump of God  proclaim his wonders far abroad  And earth and air and skies and seas  Conspire to sound aloud his praise    ERE long the vail will send in twain  The king descend with all his train  The earth shall shake with awful fright  And all creation feel his might    The truimp of God it long shall sound  And rase the nations under ground  Throughout the vast domains of heaven  The voice echoes the sound is given 
 Lift up your heads ye saints in peace  The Savior comes for your release  The day of the redeem'd has come  The saints shall all be welcom'd home    Behold the church it soars on high  To meet the saints amid the sky  To hail the King in clouds of fire  And strike and tune the immortal lyre    Hosanna now the trump shall sound  Proclaim the joys of heav'n around  When all the saints together join  In songs of love and all divine    With Enoch here we all shall meet  And worship at Messiah's feet  Unite our hands and hearts in love  And reign on thrones with Christ above 
 The city that was seen of old  Whose walls were jasper and streets gold  We'll now inherit thron'd in might  The Father and the Son's delight    Celestial crowns we shall receieve  And glories great our God shall give  While loud hosannas we'll proclaim  And sound aloud our Saviors name    Our hearts and tongues all joined in one  A loud hosanna to proclaim  While all the heavens shall shout again  And all creation say, Amen 
 For Baptism    COME ye children of the kingdom  Sing with me for joy to day  Gather round as Christ's disciples  Kneel with grateful hearts and pray    There's aline contain'd in Matthew  What the Savior said to John  And the sacred words from heaven  This is my beloved Son.    As 'twas said to Nicodemus  So I must be born again  Tis by water and the spirit  I the promise may obtain    So I will obey the Savior  Keep his law and do his will  That I may enjoy forever  Happiness on Zions hill 
 Songs of Zion    My soul is full of peace and love  I soon shall see Christ from above  And angels too the hallow'd throng  Shall join with me in holy song    The spirits power has sealed my peace  And filled my soul with heav'nly grace  Transported I with peace and love  Am waiting for the throngs above    Prepare my heart prepare my tongue  To join His glorious heav'nly throng  To hail the Bridegroom from above  And join the band in songs of love    Let all my powrs of mind combine  To hail my Savior all divin  To hear his voice attend his call  And crown him King and Lord of all 
 THE happy day has rolled on  The glorious period now has come  The angel sure has come again  To introduce Messiah's reign    The gospel trump again is heard  The truth from darkness has appear'd  The lands which long in darkness lay  Have now beheld a glorious day    The day by prophets longs foretold  The day which Abraham did behold  The day that saints desired long  When God his strange work would perform    The day when saints again should hear  The voice of Jesus in their ear  And angels who above do reign  Come down to converse hold with men 
 The Celestial Home    BEYOND these earthly scenes insight  Immortal beings rest  In realms of infinite delght  The home of Jesus Christ    CHORUS O the home the glorious home  Of the beloved Son  Where the righteous all shall meet  And be forever one!    Celestial home! could our weak eyes  But half its charms explore  How would our souls desire to rise  And live on earth no more  O the home of the glorious home &c    There pain and sorrow never come  No nothing there is vain  But perfect peace and ceaseless bloom  With endless pleasure reign  O the home &c 
 No curse those blissful regions known  Nor fears create dispair  For sin the source of evry wo  Can never enter there  O the home &c.    There changing time is never known  Nor Sun o'er mountain brow  But God upon his shining thone  Fills one eternal now  O the home &c.    There is a land the Lord will bless  Whare all the Saints shall come  There is a day for righteousness  When Israel gathers home  Before the word goes forth destroy  And all the wicked burn  With songs of everlasting joy  The pure in heart return 
 Their fields beyond Missouris flood  Are in perspective seen  As unto Israel Canaan stood  While Jordan flow'd between    Through wicked men and Satan strive  to keep us from that land they drive  To try the Lords command    There all the springs of God will be  And there an end of strife  And there the righteous rising free  Shall have eternal life    There shall the will of God be done  And saints and Angels greet  And there when all in Christ is me  The best from worlds shall meet    There in the resurrection morn  The living live again  And all the children will be born  Without the sting of sin    How long our Father O how long  Shall that pure time delay  Come on come on ye holy throng  And bring the glorious day

Beloved Brethren:    On Saturday last  the 28th ult, the Fifth Company of this seasons  emigration left Liverpool per Guion S. S.  Wisconsin, in charge of Elder Abraham Maw,  with Wm L. Stewart as his first, and H. H.   Thomas as his second counsellors. Brother Geo.  F. Phillips clerk of Company. John T. Kay and  James H. Newton returning missionaries. Elder  James Johnson, of the Sugar House Ward, who  had been visiting his friends, and obtaining some  genealogy, returned with this Company. We  telegraphed you 123 had sailed, but there  were only 113, one family by the name of  Thos. DeLara turned back. This reduced the  numbers as follows 5 Missionaries 108 emigrants  73 full and 15 half fares including missionaries  We shall not send any more companies until  August 2nd when another company of British  Saints will sail per Guion S. S. Wisconsin D. V.  We are all well at 42, I am thankful to say;  Brother Walter Hoge and L. R. Thomas are at-  tending to the business and emigration in the  office and John E. Carlisle on the "Millennial 
 Star." Bro. Carlisle has been on a visit to London  with Dr H. J. Richards and family, Bro.  Phillips has been assisting on the Star  but he has left for Bear Lake Stake where  he expects to make his home. Brother  Joseph Whiteley, the convert from the  Church of England has also left this  country to make a home amongst the  Saints. We have had a visit from several  of the excursionists. Bro. Ellerbeck, wife and  daughter, Philip Pugsley, wife and daughter  Wm Spicer and wife Wm Fuller wife and  daughter, James Poulsen, Chas. G. Shill,  Mrs S. Teasdel and son and others. These  excursionists do a great deal of good. Sisters  Baugh and Thomas came over to meet their  husbands who were returning home from  their missionary labors, and they visited  with their husbands relatives and friends;  also Sisters Morris, McGhie and others have  represented the Saints in Utah with much  good effect. R. F. Neslen also did much  good amongst the Saints. His trip did him  much good temporaly, I should say physically,  for his health improved very much, and also  spiritually. I hope it will continue with him.  I am pleased with the good reports received from  the Presidents of Companies and the good work accom  plished by our brethren at New York. With kind love  I remain, Your brother, Geo. Teasdale. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42, Islington, Liverpool,  July 11th 1890.    President W. Woodruff  and Council.    Beloved Brethren:    As I was pre-  paring to leave for Cheltenham to attend the  Bristol Conference, your esteemed favor  of the 27th came to hand. I must say  it was a surprise to me as I was not look-  ing for it until the fall at the end of the  Emigration season. But I am a minute  man and go and come at the call of my  file leaders, for I have but one desire in life  and that is to be where my heavenly Father  wishes me to be. This mission has been a  blessing to me and I am thankful to Him  for the experience. Last Sunday I attended  a very good Conference and Priesthood meet-  ings at Birmingham, and on Sunday week  we have a Conference of the Welsh Mission.  I have received a letter from Bro. J. Jack  about an extra charge being made in the  fare from Copenhagen. I have sent the letter  to Prest Fjeldsted for explanations. There are  always two sides, and frequently much mis-  representations, that it is always better to  hear both sides before judging. I am thankful 
 to say my health is good and I am en-  joying my mission. I preached the gospel  yesterday to a gentleman who was here in  this room for two hours and three quarters.  When I return from Cheltenham I will  write you again, as I am a little hurried  this morning to take the noon train. I  have been so busy since receiving your  letter I have had no time to think. So you  will kindly excuse this hasty epistle and  rest assured I shall have pleasure in  carrying out your councils to the best of  my poor endeavor.    With kind love to you all  believe me very affectionately    Your brother in tribulation  George Teasdale    [sideways text] Geo. Teasdale  11 July 1890  Recd July 24 [end of sideways text]
