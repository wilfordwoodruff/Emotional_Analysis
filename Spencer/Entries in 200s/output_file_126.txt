 Southern part of the mission. The Fresno Republican, has published three pieces for the Reverand Mr. Munn, against us, and two forom me,in our favor; and I have answered his last piece but do not know if they have published it as yet, if they do I will send you a copy.Our relations with the Southern Pacific Company continue to be of the most pleasant nature; their officers and Agents have treated us all with the utmost kindness and courtesy and I have this morning received from Mr. J. C. Stubsbs an annuel Pass for the presant year good on all their reoads in this state and Oregon. They have reardily issued a Pass for my wife and child when ever I have desired it; and in one case where I appealred to them in a case of extfream poverty they gave me half ^fare^ of their $30 rate, cfor a widdowand five children from this city to Ogden.The questiomn of Tracts still continues to be our great drawback. We are now entirely out,and as a consequence th Elders are largly curtailed ifn their labors. With the force of Elders we now have we need at least 5000 a month which would be less than xx00 100 per month for each Elder. When the elders are canvassing from house ^to house^ they must have Tracts or their labors seem to be almost in vain.Open air meetings cannot now be sucsessfully held on account of the weather so our presant mode of prosecuting our labors is visit-ing investigators and canvassing from house to house, and we fully expect that during the winter, byn this means we shall have the pleasure of leading quite a number down ointo the water.During the last month I have visited the Elders in Fresno, Visalia, Santa Paula and Los Angeles aned as the season rolls on I intend to visit all the Elders in the mission in their several fields of labor and do all that I can to brace them up and aid and encourage them in their labors.A glorious future looms up before us. Opportunities are opening up on every hand. A good class of people are coming intothe Church; and investigators are coming into the church becoming momore plentifull every day.We know not whether we have risen to the standard requir-ed, or accomplished the amount of work expected of us; but we feel grgreatly encouraged by the brightening prospects before us. We take delight in our labors, and we enter the new year with unbounded con-fidence in the Lord that he will enable us to reap a rich harvest of souls and bgather them into the fold as the year ninty eightrolsrolls arround.We will receive with particular pleasure any instructions that you may see fit to give in relation to our conduct and the course you wish us to persue in directing the labors of the Elders during the coming years.The prayers of the Elders assend to the Almighty contin-ually in behalf of our Grand old President, Brother Woodruff;Your Brother in the GospelE.

 of that peculiar document a copy of which you sent me. I think that I succeeded in showing him the ordaer of the Priesthood and that the Lorld would appear to the communicate with his servant who stands at the head of the Church directly, when he had occasion to do so, and not with a lay member. I pointed toout to ^him^ the stamp of the cloven foot all over his communication and I think that he is satisfied. He said he was very glad that I had come and given him the necessary in-struction.I deeply regret dear Brother, the fact, that you have been troubl-ed so much by people writing to you on these matters from this mis-sion. We have a Sister in San Diego who seems to want something that we are unable to give her; she has written you twice for more light. I think we must be very close to the infernal regions out here as many people declare to us that they get revelations and visitations from the unseen at willL; nevertheless occasionally we find some good honest souls who gladly listen to the truth.The Elders at presant are all well and enjoying their labors and the Sister missionaries so far as has developed are prov-ing a great help in the work.Please send me such suggestions or instructions as may seem good to you and I will carry them out to the best of my ability.And now Dear Brother; with a prayer for your welfare and continued happiness and the prosperity of Zion, I remain,Your Brother in the Gospel, E.

 All through the country districts a free good wiill pre-vails-with but feww exceptions. The people are willing to come outtto our meetings and listen to the doctrines we teach and it seemasto be only a question of time before many good people will come itnto the Church.I believe it would be a good plan to take a large Tent inwhich to hold meetings and go through these country settlements, stay a week or two at a time place. Take two or trhree Elders and their wives who weare good singers, the singing is a great attractinand would secure good audiences in every country district, this woudgive us an opertunity to rweach the people,and the preseance and in-fluence of the Sisters would I believe ^have^ a most benificial effect wihthe people. pPlease siginify your approval, or other-wise, of such a measure.Out-door Preaching is now being prosecuted with vigor in all thetowns and cities of the counties in wihich the Elders are laboring;and it proves to be the most effectual way of reaching the people;all the Elders are delighted with it and declare it to be the amongthe most pleasant experiences of their missionary life, and the besttraining that an elder can have.Though I am stationed hewith head-quarters here in San Francisco yet the courtesies extended tio me by the S/P.  Company enable metto visvit the Elders in their several fields of labor and thus en-courage and assist them in the actual work of preaching the gospel.The financial assistance you so kindly sent us was I as-sure you was gratef^u^lly received and the 'Baby' (Mission) thus as-sisted tlo its feet, will, Ife I feel safe in asserting, soon be ableto stand alone-financially.And now Dear Brother, trusting that the waty we are prose-cuting our labors in this mission will receive the stamop of yourapproval and that you will signify your wishes in regard to uourfuture course should you desire any changes there-in, and with a prayer to the aAlmighty for his deivine favors to rest continually uponyou and your fellow laborers in the work of the Lord,I remain Obediently yours,E.

 915 Golden Gate Ave. San Francisco, Cala.Feb. 28th, 1898.pPresaidient Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother;One of our investigators, a lady has applied for baptism;but has confessed that she had an abortion commited upon herself when she was foive or six months along in pregnancy. She was and is, living with her husband at the time, and had two sons; a rupture with her husband that seemed as though it would result in seperatino^n^caused her to do as she did. She now feels keenly the enormity of the sin she commited. What is our diuty? aAre we at liberty to bap-tize her? May she come  into the fold? Her husband though not an ininvestigator, is not opposed and would be willing that the wife shouldbe baptized. As the element of doubt enters into my soul, as tho the right course to persue in the matter, I humble seek for instructiosnPraying for special blessings upon you in your high call-ing, I remain, your Brother in the Lord;E.

 -:CALIFORNIA MISSION:-508 Fulton St. San Francisco, Calif.May, 31st, 1897.President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother;Here with I send you material that I have prepared for aTract subject to your approval. The Tracts we now have in this missnsion are unsatisfactory, and if this meets your approval I should like very much to have the privelege of getting it published, as Ithink it will be suitable for our work in this mission.Our Tracts obtained from Chattanooga, cost us 60 centsper 100 ^delivered here^ and when we send them out to the Elders in small quantitiesthere is another 18 cents added for stamps per each 100 this bringsthem rather high, whereas if we could have a good supply on handwhen an Elder goes out to his field of labor he could take withhim sufficient to last his district for some time and this wouldcut off as time rolls on, quite an amount fthrat we now pay out forstamps. I understand that the Tracts cost in Chattanooga 42 centsper 100. We have an offer from a reliable firm to publish the Tract,if we give an order forr 40,000 the price to be $145.50. As this wwill bring the tTracts down to a fraction over 36 cents per 100, andby haveing a good supply on hand ^will^ enable us to send them out withthe Elders when they go to their several fields, in many cases enou-gh to last them till they return. By this means we can furnishtwice the amount of reading matter for what our Tracts now cost us.And thus scatter the writen word more freely. The 40,000 Tractswill not be more than enough for six or eight months supply, at therate we need to use them and arfter that a better price can be obtai-ned as the price above includes the stereotype.Should you approve of the Tract, and of the matter ofgetting them published here, please return me the coppy. If in your judgement you think it can be improved by adding to, in any partic-ular part, or by cutting out any thing that is objectionable, pleasesignify your wishes in the matter. I designed to have the articlesof faith added, and if you could send me a plate of the Temple toplace the picture of that noble edifice on the outer leaf I think iit would lend an added interest to the Tract.The San Francisco Call, has just published tte the out-line of a semrmon that I delivered last night, They also mailed freeto our friends, mostly in Utah, about 120 coppies of the paper. I hada coppy sent toeach of the Presidency, They sent their artist totake my picture as it appears in the paper.Ever praying for the blessing of heave to rest in richabundance upon you and your associates, I remain,Very truly yours,E.

 CALIFORNIA MISSION.915 Golden Gate Ave. San Francisco, Calif.March 7th, 1898.President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother;The work of the Lord in this mission is still rolling on and the word from all parts is encouraging.Since my last report I have visited all through the Southern part of the mission and I am pleased to be able to stabtethat our affairs are in a most prosperous condition at that end.I have visited Apostle Young at Pacific Grove and by his sug-gestions and wise counsels I feel greatly strengthened for the work that lays before me.In Oakland the out look is particularly bright, so much so that we have deemed it wise to engage a Hall there and for plast month it has been filled every sunday evening withe earnest seek-ers after truth. The Elders there are well received and have all that they can do in visiting those who are investigating the doctrines we teach.We have engaged Halls in San Jose and Stockton as the work in those places seemed to justify it and prospects are bright for good work to be done there as the time rolls on.In many parts of the mission there is a lively interest taken in the work of the elders by the people and many are reading our works and coming to our meetings: ist is true that in some local-ities indifferance is manifested and the elders are not meeting with as much sucsess as could be desired, but there is no active or open opposition anywhere in the mission and the Elders are feeling splendid in the good work.As the spring and summer comes along quite a number of our Elders will be entitled to release and we could use several mormore than we now have to good advantage.Several of the Elders desire that they may be permitted to have their wives with them for the remainder of their mission, I can appoint them to labor in cities where they can have the compan-ionship of their wives and I believe that the Sisters would be a great help to their husbands in the missionary work. If this seems to you consistant, and meets with your approval; will you kindly sig-nify to us your assent in this matter. The names and addresses of the Sisters I enclose herewith.I shall be gratified indeed to receive any instructions that you may see fit to send me and will do my uttermost to carry them out.Ever praying for your wellfare and for the prosperity of Zion, I remain, Your Brother in the Lord,E.

 In the meridian of ^at the appointed^ time the Savior came and dwelt among the chil-dren of men. Having been born in the stable, and cradled in the mangerthe days and years of His childhood and youth were spent with His par-ents in the ordinary walks and avocations of life. Though there weresome wonderful things occured in relation to His immaculate conceptionand birth: Angelic choirs from the upper deep descended chanting gladtidings of great joy, peace on earth, good will to man; Herod's cunningplans were baffled; his boundless rage, his cruel edict, the death ofthe innocents; Joseph's heavenly warning to flee to Egypt with the youngChild; his journey and return, his stay in Gallilee that the Scripturesmight be fulfilled "He shall be called a Nazerene" [##Matthew 2:23##] — all these droppedout of the public mind, and as the years rolled by were forgotten andlost except by His relatives and friends. As He sojourned among menduring the years of His youth and early manhood there was nothing inHis life to attract the attention of His fellows until He unostentatious-ly walked down into the waters of the river Jordan and there was bap-tized by John, and though the Holy Ghost descending from the upper deepwas seen, as Jesus walked out of the water, to rest upon Him in the formof a dove, and a voice from heaven was heard to say "This is my belovedSon in whom I am well pleased" yet men did not in Him recognize the Sonof God. [##Matthew 3:17##] Though He preached the Gospel of Repentance and Baptism for theremission of sins, chose and ordained twelve Apostles and sent themforth to preach, and went forth healing all manner of sickness and diredisease Himself—causing. the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the lame towalk and leap for joy, teaching as no other man had taught, healing as no other man had healed, rebuking as no other had ever dared rebuke menfor the sins they daily committed, they rejected Him and condemned Himto a cruel death, and though He rose again (which fact was noised abroadso that all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were cognizant of it) yet theycould not see in Him the Savior of the world.On the great day of Pentecost when there were gathered together de-vout men of all the surrounding nations, "suddenly there came a soundfrom heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, and it filled all the housewhere they were sitting, and there appeared unto them cloven tongueslike as of fire, and it sat upon each of them (the Apostles) and theywere all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tonguesas the Spirit gave them utterance" and the people of the multitude wereall amazed for they hqrd heard the wonderful works of God each in hisown tongue. [##Acts 2:2-4##] Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice andsaid unto them, "Ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, bethis known unto you, and hearken to my words." Then, repeating thewords of the Prophet Joel, he showed to them that Christ should come, and briefly sketching the history of His life, recounting His wonderfulworks and noble deeds, showing forth the fact to the people that theyhad by cruel hands put Him to death, thus crucifying the Lord of glory; that in fulfillment of the Prophet's words, God had raised Him from thedead; that on the third day He had been seen by the Apostles and manyothers with whom He had conversed, "whereof we all are witnesses" [##Acts 2:32##] There-fore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the

 Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, He hath shed forth this which yenow see and hear. Therefore let all the House of Israel know assuredlythat God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lordand Christ". Now when they heard this they were pricked in their heartsand said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles "Men and Brethrenwhat shall we do?" Not until this moment did they believe in Christ asthe Savior of the world. Though all His wonderful works had been per-formed in their midst, yet not until the story of His life, His terribledeath, His glorious resurrection, and the wonderful out-pouring of theHoly Ghost now so magnificently manifested before their eyes, did faithspring forth in their hearts, and a desire to be partakers of theheavenly gift caused them to plead with the Apostles, "Oh what shall wedo!" [##Acts 2:14-37##] This faith is the main-spring of all action, a mighty moving power.By it Noah, Abraham and Moses performed their wonderful works; the chil-dren of Israel passed through the Red Sea, the walls of Jerico fell, theHarlot Rahab perished not; Gideon, Barak, David and others of the prop-hets subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises andstopped the mouths of lions. The Apostle Paul understood the wonderfulpower of faith when he said, ##Hebrews 11:6|Heb. XI, 6th,## "But without faith it is im-possible to please Him; for he that cometh to God must believe that Heis, and that He is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him." Thisverse is self explanatory. If we did not know that God lives and willreaward those that diligently seek Him, we would not seek Him at all.The ##Hebrews 11:3|3rd verse## reads:"Through faith we understand that the worlds wereframed by the word of God." So then, not only could the wonderful worksbefore recounted be performed by the old worthies, but even worlds couldbe framed when necessary through the faith that was in God who createdthem. But will faith alone accomplish the salvation of the souls ofman? As opinions differ, and he who risks his soul's salvation upon theuncertainties of men's opinions has but a vain hope of being led aright,let the Scriptures answer the question. ##James 2:14-26|James 2nd ch. 14-26.## This de-claration of the great Apostle seems to set at rest for all time thetheory that faith alone is sufficient to save mankind. In closing hisspeech, he very forcibly states that "As the body without the spirit isdead, so faith without works is dead also." Shall we not say then, thatworks are necessary, and if so what are those works? Again let theScriptures tell the tale. ##Matthew 3:2|Math. 3, 2nd## "In those days came John theBaptist—saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand."Jesus came preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, (##Mark 1:15|Mark 1, 15th.##)"And saying, the time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand;repent ye, and believe the Gospel." ##Mark 6:12|Mark 6, 12th,## "And they (the Apostles)went out, and preached that men whould repent." Jesus was evidentlydetermined that there should be no mistake upon this matter when He said,(##Luke 13:3-5|Luke 13, 3-5##) "I tell you nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all like-wise perish. Or those eighteen upon twhom the tower in Siloam fell andslew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwell atJerusalem? I tell you NAY; but except ye repent, ye shall all like-wise perish." The word of the Lord to Israel in the days of Ezekiel wasequally positive. (##Ezekiel 18:30|Ezek. 18, 30th##) "Therefore I will judge you, Oh Houseof Israel, everyone according to his ways, saith the Lord God. Repent

 one will have the audacity to assert that He who gave His life and shedHis blood that we may obtain eternal life, has not the right to estab-lish the conditions upon which we may secure the benefits of that aton-ing blood. His promise is plain, and in language unmistakable, "He thatbelieves and is baptized shall be saved" and let us not forget thatthe declaration is equally positive that "He that believeth not shallbe damned." [##Mark 16:16##] Nor is John the Beloved less im^ex^plicit in his statement ofwhat the Savior said to Nicodemas (##John 3:5|John 3, 5th##) "Jesus answered, verilyverily I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God." Here is a declaration fromthe great Master Himself that ought to be sufficient answer to all whofondly imagine that they can find some other way. Again, there arethose who believe that if they live a life of honor and integrity amongmen, and serve God according to the best light they have, that they willbe entitled to an inheritance in the Kingdom of God. To all such letthe Scriptures once more declare the fact. (##Acts 10:1-6|Acts 10, 1-6)##and 48th) "Therewas a man in Cesarea called Cornelius, a Centurion of the band calledthe Italion Band, a devout man and one that feared God with all hishouse, which gave much alms to the people and prayed to God alway. Hesaw in a vision, evidently about the ninth hour of the day, an Angel ofGod coming in to him and saying unto him,—Cornelius; and when he lookedon him he was afraid and said,—What is it, Lord? and He said unto himThy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God; andnow send men to Joppa and call for one Simon whose sir name is Peter.He lodgeth with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea-side. Heshall tell thee what thou oughtest to do." Ah! Cornelius, thou God-fearing, alms-giving, prayerful man, there is something that you havenot done! Though your faith has reached unto heaven, and your prayershave been heard and your alms-giving considered by the Almighty, yetthere is something that you have not done of such great importance thatthe windows of heaven were opened and an angel sent forth unto you as a messenger, to notify you of the fact. What is it, Cornelius? He sentfor Peter as he was commanded, and when Peter came, saw their faith andheard their words and they believed on the Lord Jesus, "He command-ed them to be baptized." [##Acts 10:48##] This is the door into the Kingdom of God.Now there is a great diversity of opinion among men as to the grandobject for which Baptism was institutied; some believing that it shouldbe performed in the presence of a great number of people as a testimonyto them that the humble penitent has put on Christ; others again, claim-ing that it is an "outward sign of an inward grace", and still others,that it was intended as a witness before men of a "change of heart". Nota word can be found in the Scriptures to support any of these positions, but on the other hand, evidence abounds in the sacred Record to provethat the ordinance of baptism was for the purpose of "washing away" and"for the remission of sins". Let us take the testimony of ##Mark 1:4|Saint Mark 1,4;##"John did pbaptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentancefor the remission of sins;" of ##Luke 3:3|St. Luke 3, 3,## "And he came into all thecountry about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the re-mission of sins;" ##Acts 2:38|Acts 2, 38,## "Then Peter said unto them, Repent andbe baptised, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the re-

 mission of sins." Also ##Acts 22:16|Acts 22, 16,## "And now why tarriest thou? Ariseand be baptized and wash away thy sins." Here the grand question ariseswhat does sin consist of? Is it not the violation of law or the break-ing of a command, and is not the sin of ommission as great as the sinof commission? Surely the commandment "Remember the Sabbath day to keepit holy" is just as binding as the one that precedes it "Thou shalt nottake the name of the Lord they God in vain"; yet the failure to obey theone would be the sin of ommission, while to break the other would be thesin of commission. [##Exodus 20:7-8##] And are not the commandments issued by the Saviorand His Apostles as much the commands of God as those uttered forth fromthe coloud-capped peak of Mount Sinai? And if so, a failure to complywhen "God commands all men everywhere to repent" as in ##Acts 22:16|Acts 22, 16,## orwhere Peter commanded them to "repent and be baptized for the remissionof sins" as in ##Acts 2:38|Acts 2, 38,## brings us under the condemnation of a brokenlaw and adjudges us all as sinners before God.Having now discovered the door of the straight and narrow way thatleads to eternal life, which is baptism, and the object of that baptismthat it is for the purpose of remitting or washing away our sins, itnow becomes particularly interesting to decide who are proper candidatesfor baptism. Among the various sects and creeds of modern christendommany believe in the practise of baptizing little children. We unhesi-tateingly say without fear of successful contradiction, that no foundatioor justification of such a practice can be found in the Scriptures.It has been shown beyong question according to the Scriptures, thatbaptism is for the remission of sins. Sin is the breaking of laws orcommands of God. The child, until it comes to the years of understand-ing, is not able to comprehend law or understand the binding nature ofa command—to obey or disobey; hence it is irresponsible. For wherethere is no comprehension there is no law; and where there is no lawthere can be no sin; and where there is no sin, baptism is uncalled forand out of place and is the direct violation of the commands of our Sav-ior. For if by baptism one child who dies in its infancy may be usheredinto the arms of Jesus, and for the lack of baptism another child dyingin its infancy is forbidden His sacred presence, then are we not bereak-ing His direct command where He said, as in ##Mark 10:13-15|St. Mark 10, 13-15## "And theybrought young children to Him that He sholuld touch them, and His discip-les rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it He was much displeased, andsaid unto them 'Suffer little children to come unto mMe and forbid themnot, for of such is the Kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whoso-ever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon them and blessed them." The testimony of St. Luke is almost identical.It reads as follows (##Luke 18:15-17|Luke 18, 15-17##) "And they brought unto Him also,infants that He should touch them, but when His disciples saw it theyrebuked them. But Jesus called them unto Him, and said, Suffer littlechildren to come unto Me, and forbid them not for of such is the King-dom of God. Verily I say u)nto you, whosoever shall not receive the King-dom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein." Clearlythen, baptism was never intended for little children, for baptism hav-ing been instituted for the purpose of washing away sins, sins alreadycommitted, and the child not having committed any, the ordinance would 
 not apply. But what is more important than all, he that believes inand declares it necessary for the little child to be baptized, and bap-tizes it, is committing a most grievous sin in the sight of God. For ifit were true, as claimed by many Christians, that the little infant thatdies without baptism is shut out from the presence of God, that hell ispaved with little unbaptized children, they are erecting a barrier tothose little infants in the form of the ordinance of baptism and "for-bidding" all such to come unto Christ, thus breaking one of His most em-phatic commands uttered when "He was much displeased" at what they weredoing and said, "Forbid them not, but suffer them to come unto Me." [##Mark 10:14##] Thelittle child is pure and innocent because it can commit no sin till itcomes to the years of accountability. Sin then conceives in its heart, and as it grows in years Satan tempts it and it becomes sinful and wick-ed, and the means provided by the Almighty to cleanse it and make itagain as pure and as innocent as it was in the beginning of its mortalcareer, is the sacred ordinance of baptism. And thus may the repentantsinner become like the example that Jesus set before them as shown by##Matthew 18:2-4|Mat. 18, 2-4##; "And Jesus called a little child unto Him and set him inthe midst of them and said, Verily I say unto you, except you be con-verted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the king-dom of heaven. Whosoever, therefore, shall humble himself as this littlechild, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven." Thus the littlechild is given to us as a pattern of purity, a sample of innocence, bythe Savior Himself; and the bare theory of baptizing such little inno-cents to wash away their sins, becomes revolting to the human mind whenconsidered under the light of reason, as the practice of it is an abom-ination in the sight of God. So little children are not elegible tobaptism. This declaration stands out in bold relief when viewed in thelight of the following passages which plainly prove that all candidatesfor the kingdom of God must be capable of being taught. (##Matthew 28:19-20|Nat. 28, 19-20##)"Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name ofthe Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to ob-serve all things whatsoever I have commanded you." All must have suf-ficient mental development to be capable of believing the doctrinestaught, as shown by the Savior's commandments, and ##Mark 16:16|Mark 16, 16##, "He thatbelieveth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth notshall be damned." "But when they believed Phillip preaching the thingsconcerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they werebaptized, both men and women." (##Acts 8:12|Acts 8, 12##) "And as they went on theirway they came unto a certain water, and the Eunuch said, See here iswater; what does hinder me to be baptized? and Phillip said, If thoutruly believest with all thine heart though mayest, and he answered andsaid, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." (##Acts 8:36-37|Acts 8, 36-7##)A knowledge of the divine truths of revealed religion when onceimpressed upon the heart, causes faith to spring forth in the soul, andwe reflect with admiration upon the life of Him whose wondrous love wasmanifested towards us when He offered His life as a sacrifice for oursins. And by comparison we realize our own unworthiness, that our feethave strayed from the path of right and that we are steeped in iniquity.With this conviction comes a resolution to turn, if possible, from our 
 wicked ways and walk in newness of life. This brings repentance, a for-saking of sin, a reverence for Almighty God and an earnest desire tosearch after and serve Him in spirit and in truth. We resolve to treadthe path our Savior walked, down into the waters of baptism, thus following Him down through the door into the Kingdom of God, that where He iswe may be also. Sufficient mental capacity to be taught, to believe,to repent and to voluntarily offer ones self for obedience to the suc-ceeding principle of the Gospel are prerequisites to the ordinance ofbaptism. Little children cannot do these things, consequently there isno law of God requiring them to be baptised; and all man-made systemsto the contrary will be null and void in the day of judgment.MODE OF BAPTISM.As there are so ma^n^y conflicting opinions on this question; theorthodox Christian churches having departed from the faith of theApostles, and built up churches to themselves for the purpose of makingmerchandise of the souls of men, have instituted the practice of sprin-kling and pouring &c. and call it baptism, to support which not oneword can be found in holy Writ. The whole sense of the ordinance ofbaptism from the time that John the Baptist came preaching the baptismof repentance for the remission of sins, on through all the writings ofthe New Testament conclusively proves the fact that baptism by immers-ion was the mode taught and practiced by Jesus and His Apostles. [##Matthew 3:1-2##] Jesus, when He was baptized, "Went up straightway out of the water." [##Matthew 3:16##] WhenPhillip baptized the Eunuch "They went down both into the water, bothPhillip and the Eunuch, and he baptized him, and when they were come upout of the water, &c" [##Acts 8:38-39##] All this clearly indicates immersion, or why godown into or come up out of the water? Paul says to the ##Romans 6:4|Romans 4, 4##;"Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death" ##Romans 6:5|5th##, "For ifwe have been planted together in the likeness of His death." Certainlythere is nothing in a sprinkling or a pouring that represents either a burial or a planting, but each of these passages point in Unmistakableterms to a baptism by immersion. The Apostle Paul again makes this clearin his Episitle to the ##Colossians 2:12|Collosians 2, 12##; "Buried with Him in baptismwherein also ye are risen with Him." When John baptized in the wilder-ness "There went out unto him all the land of Judea and they of Jeru-salem, and were all baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessingtheir sins." (##Mark 1:5|Mark 1, 5##)All the evidence contained in the sacred Scriptures points unmis-takably to the fact that immersion was the only mode of baptism practic-ed by the Apostles and early Christians. Profane history gives con-clusive evidence of this fact. Speaking of baptism in the first cen-tury Dr. Mosheim says "In this century baptism was administered in con-venient places without the public assemblies, and by immersing the can-didate wholly in water." (Mosheim's Church History (Murdock) ThirdEdition, Vol. 1, p. 87) Of the second century, the same great authorsays: "Twice a year, namely at Easter and Whitsuntine, baptism wasadministered by the Bishop or by the presbyters acting by his commandand authority. The candidates for it were immersed wholly in water withthe invocation of the sacred Trinity, according to the Savior's precept."Indeed, the first deviation from baptizing by immersion occurs ina case recorded by Eusebius, as happening in the third century. He alludes 
 to it in these detracting terms: "He (Novatian) fell into a griev-ous distemper, and it beigng supposed that he would die immediately hereceived baptism (being sprinkled with water) on the bed where he lay,(if that can be termed baptism) neither when he had escaped that sick-ness, did he afterwards receive the other things which the canon of theChurch enjoined should be received." (Ecclesiastical History, (Eusebius)p. 113) Even down to the close of the thirteenth century baptism byimmersion was the rule, and sprinkling and pouring the exception. Yetthe innovation thus made in the third century has worked its insiduousway in the various divisions of Christianity until to-day a convert canhave any kind of baptism he may desire; thus have they departed fromthe faith of the Apostles and are teaching for religion the commandmentsof men, having "Transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, brokenthe everlasting covenant," in fulfillment of the words of the ProphetIsaiah. (Isaiah 24, 5)GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST.The next step in the regular order of initiation into the fold ofChrist is to secure the birth of the Spirit, or the baptism of the HolyGhost; this being essential to enable us to pursue an acceptable coursein the service of the Lord, that the Holy Ghost may be with us as anabiding gift, as a light ^lamp^ to our feet and a light to our pathway throughlife. The Lord in His wonderful plan for the salvation of the souls ofmen has provided a way for the humble and penitent baptized believer tosecure this blessed gift. (Mark 1, 8) "I indeed have baptized you withwater, but He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost." (Acts 1, 5) "ForJohn truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the HolyGhost not many days hence." Behold the promise fulfilled. (Acts 2, 2-4)"And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty windand it filled all the house where they were sitting, and there appearedunto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.And then^y^ were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak withother tongues as the spirit gave them utterance." But this preciousgift was not to be given until after Jesus was glorified, as shown bythe following, (John 7, 39) "—for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, be-cause that Jesus was not yet glorified."On that great Penticostal day the Holy Ghost was given and a glor-ious manifestation of heavenly light appeared sitting upon each of theApostles who had accompanied the Savior in all His travels and had wit-nessed His wonderful works, and by His divine favor had been made par-takers of His holy ministry. They now received the promised blessingin rich abundance, and a way was provided by which they might transmitit to others who would comply with the special requirements, as shownby the following: (Acts 8, 17) "Then laid they their hands on them andthey received the Holy Ghost." Evidently the Holy Ghost came not as theresult of the baptism nor in answer to ^the^ prayer of the Apostles, but bythe laying on of their hands. Clearly showing that this was the mode theLord had provided by which the Holy Ghost should be conferred upon bap-tized believers; this again is clearly set forth in Acts 19, 5-6 "When 
 they heard this they were baptized in thename of the Lord Jesus. Andwhen Paul had laid his hands on them the Holy Ghost came on them, andthey spake with tongues and prophesied.The Blood of Christ.We have now pointed out to the penitent believer the path thatleads to eternal life, the straight and narrow way, and carefull notedthe inscriptions along the line, down into the water through the doorinto the kingdom of God. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance ofall sins, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, gift of theHoly Ghost by the laying on of hands; this is the course marked out bythe Father to prepare His children to receive the benefits of the aton-ing blood of Jesus Christ. Earthly things are typical of heavenlythings as set forth in the following (1 John 5, 7-8) "For there arethree that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the HolyGhost, and these three are one; and there are three that bear witnessin the earth, the Spirit, the water and the blood, and these three agreein one." By the water we keep the commandment, by the spirit are wejustified and by the blood are we sanctified; and thus we become Saints.He who has fully repented of his sins and been baptized for the remiss-ion thereof, and received the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, maythen partake of the emblems of the Savior's flesh and blood; and inthat sacred ordinance eat and drink to His soul the benefits of thatatoning blood. And such have the promise of the Savior that they shallnever hunger or thirst. There is no other way provided on earth bywhich mankind can secure the benefits of the aton)ing blood of Christ.AUTHORITY.Upon this question hinges the validity of all the acts of men.Every officer of our Government must be elected or appointed accordingto the mode established by the constitution of the United States, or his official acts fall to the ground as null and void. The decisionsof the court involving the validity of titles to land or other great inter-ests would be void if it could be shown that the judge rendering thedecision had not been elected or appointed legally. Every deed issuedby a Sheriff at a sherriff's sale of real estate would be void if itcould be shown that the sheriff was a usurper and not legally authorizedto officiate in the duties of the office. All naturalization papersissued by a judge when it could be shown that he had never been electedor appointed according to constitutional requirements, would by a legaltribunal be declared worthless and the holder deprived of his citizen-ship. In fact the question of authority to act in any of the affairs ofhuman life is so clearly understood by all persons of ordinary intell-igence that time would seem to be wasted in discussing it; but not soin questions involving the future of the human soul. In these sacredand vastly more important matters upon which hang all our hopes ofeternal life, the average man seems willing to trust to the opinions ofa minister of some of the orthodox sects or to the wild vagaries of anyupstart who cries "Lo here is Christ," or "Lo he is there" without fora single moment raising the question—Where is his authority to offic- 
 iate in the sacred ordinances of the Gospel of Christ? or to initiatemen into the kingdom of God? The average merchant in conducting hisregular business, when waited upon by one claiming to be an agent of amanufacturer, places his order with that agent fully expecting to re-ceive the goods. As the time rolls on the goods come according. to thesample shown and the order given. This fact alone is proof to the mer-chant that the agent was in touch with his principal and was a dulyauthorized agent. But if the good^s^ come not, it is strogng presumptiveevidence that the agent was a fraud and was not authorized by the manu-facturer to take orders for goods. If this test be applied to theministers of the various sects of the Christian world it will at oncebe found that they are self-appointed agents, not in touch with theprincipal whom they claim to represent, as their patrons receive notthe goods. In other words the signs and wonders promised by the Saviorare lacking and do not follow the believer, which alone is sufficientevidence that the so-called ministers are never sent of God. Jesus said"Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature, hethat believeth and is baptized shall be saeved, but he that believethnot shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe;in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing itshall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall re-cover." These signs though forming one of the most prominent featuresof the Gospel in the days of the Apostles are not to be found in any ofthe contending sects of modern Christendom. Such as hunger and thirstafter righteousness become members of the various churches and humblybow at their sanctuaries, believing the doctrines there taught. Hunger-ily they seek food for their souls; thirstily they come, like sheep, to the fountain, only to fingd that the storehouse is empty, the fountainis dry. The promised blessigsngs fail, the signs do not follow, they re-ceive not the goods. The grand secret of it all is, God has not sentthe agents through whom they seek these blessings; they hold no author-ity to officiate in the ordinances of His house. As agents they arenot in touch with their Principal. These ministers are self-appointedteachers of man-made systems of religion, they are teaching for doctrinethe commandments of men.From the time the Christian Fathers fell by persecution, death orcontroversy, from their original faith down to the time of the EmperiorConstantine made the catholic faith universal through the Roman pro-vinces in the ^year^ 323 A D, the forms of the Christian religion were con-statntly undergoing a change. At that time there were incorporated inthe Christian Church, heathen rites, which with the innovation addeddown through the ages to the present time, stamps that church to-dayas one entirely separate and apart from the original apostolic Church.Without Apostles and Prophets through whom they might obtain the wordof God, the Church has steadily drifted from its moorings unto ^onto^ thebroad sea of men's opinions till it is split and divided into hundredsof different sects and creeds, no one of which can present an organ-ization to-day that even resembles the form of the Church of Christ. The 
 most important features have been eliminated. Signs and wonders andmiraculous gifts, together with the fruits of the Spirit, set forth bythe Apostle Paul in ##1 Corinthians 12|first Cor. 12th## have disappeared, and but the emptypowerless form is found to-day among the children of men. The shadowalone remains; the substance has departed. And why? Because mankindhave departed from the faith of the ancients. The rights, powers andprivileges of the Apostolic Priesthood have long since been withdrawnfrom man, and all who officiate in religious rites do so without auth-ority from the living God.If we examine and see how the servants of God were called to theministry in other ages we can discover a guide to direct us in obtain-ing authority in this age. Moses was called from out the burning bushby God Himself (##Exodus 3|Ex. 3##) and when he was about to be succeeded by Joshuaas leader, Hhe conferred upon Joshua the holy priesthood by the layingon of his hands. (See ##Deuteronomy 34:9|Deut. 34, 9##) "And Joshua, the son of Nun was fullof the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his hands upon him." Jesuswhen He entered upon His ministry, called twelve and ordained them, viz;"And He ordained twelve that they should be with Him and that He mightsend them forth to preach." (##Mark 3:14|Mark 3, 14##) Again He says "Ye have ^not^ chosenMe but I have chosen you and ordained you." (##John 15:16|John 15, 16##). Jesus saidin His prayer unto His Father, "As Thou hast sent Me into the world evenso have I also sent them into the world." (##John 17:18|John 17, 18##). The ApostlePaul evidently had this question of authority to meet, as he gave ventto his feelings in the following forcible language, "Whereunto I am or-dained a preacher and an Apostle (I speak the truth in Christ and lienot), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity." (##1 Timothy 2:7|I Tim. 2, 7##). Itwas very gratifying no doubt to the Apostle Paul to be able to declarewith such emphasis the fact of his ordination, and no wonder when weconsider the way in which he was called. He was justly entitled to de-clare it, as will be seen by the manner of his calling. "As they minis-tered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Ghost said: Separate me Barnabusand Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they hadfasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away, sothey being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, &c" (##Acts 13:2-4|Acts 13, 2-4##) Paul thenwas evidently called by direct revelation of the Holy Ghost, and whenthe hands of the Prophets were laid upon him, he was sent away, as alsowas his companion Barnabus.The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews makes a most positive de-claration on this question. He says: "For every High Priest taken fromamong men is ordained for men, in things pertaining to God that he mayoffer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; And no man taketh thishonor to himself, but he that is called of God as was Aaron." (##Hebrews 5:1-4|Heb. 5,4##) 
 A glance at ##Exodus 4:14-16|Exodus 4, 14-16 and 27-28## will show us how Aaron was called:"And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and Hs said, Is nnot Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well, andalso behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and when he seeth thee he willbe glad in his heart. And thou shalt speak unto him and put words inhis mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and willteach you what ye shall do; and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people"Thus Aaron was called of God; and in all ages when God has had a peopleon the earth, His servants have been duly called of Him and ordained,and the stamp of His approval has been placed on their labors in signsand wonders and miraculous manifestations.LACK OF AUTHORITY.Not only are the Scriptures teeming with evidence that the servantsof God were duly authorized, call ed and ordained, to officiate in theordinances of His house in all ages of which the Bible gives us any ac-count, but the fact stands out in bold relief, that in every instancewhere men dared to act without authority the Lord manifested His dis-pleasure in a just rebuke for their presumption; as in the case ofKing Saul recorded in ##1 Samuel 13:8-14|I Sam, 13, 8-13##: "And he tarried seven days ac-cording to the set time that Samuel had appointed, but Samuel came notto Gilgal and the people were scattered from him. And Saul said, Bringhither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings. And he offered theburnt offering. And it came to pass that as soon as he had made an endof offering the burnt offering, behold Samuel came; and Saul went outto meet him. And Samuel said What hast thou done? and Saul said Be-cause I sawst that the people were scattered from me and that thoucamest not within the days appointed, and that the Phillistines gatheredthemselves together at Michmash; therefore said I: The Phillistines willcome down now upon me to Gilgal and I have not made supplication untothe Lord; I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering. AndSamuel said to Saul: Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept thecommandment of the Lord thy God which He commanded thee; for now wouldthe Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever, but now thykingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought Him a man after Hisown heart and the Lord hath commanded him to be Captain over His peoplebecause thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee." And thushe lost his kingdom and his life through daring to officiate in thepriest's office without authority. Nor did Uzziah, king of Judah re-ceive any better recognition, for though he had gained the favor ofheaven in his earlier days through obedience to the commands of God,yet in after years when proud and haughty and flushed with victory, heessayed to officiate in the Priest's office, as shown in the following:"But when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction, forhe transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple ofthe Lord to burn incense upon the alter of incense. And Azariah, thepriest went in after him and with him four score priests of the Lord thatwere valiant men. And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said untohim: It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, 
 but to the priests, the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn in-cense. Go out of the sanctuary for though hast trespassed; neither shallit be for thine honor from the Lord God. Then Uzziah was wroth and hada censor in his hand to burn incense. And while he was wroth with thepriests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests inthe house of the Lord, from beside the incense altar. And Azariah thechief priest and all the priests looked upon him, and behold he wasleprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence, yea, him-self hasted also to go out because the Lord had smitten him. And Uzziahthe King was a leper unto the day of his death." [##2 Chronicles 26:16-21##] Such a terriblepenalty, it would seem, should have been a warning to all succeedinggenerations to refrain from interfering with sacred things withoutauthority. But another single instance is recorded before God gave themup to a reprobate mind, and this was during the days of the Apostles, andis contained in the following quotation: "Then certain of the vagabondJews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spiritsthe name of the Lord Jesus, saying; We abjure you by Jesus whom Paulpreacheth. And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew and chief ofthe priests, who did so. And the evil spirit answered and said; JesusI know and Paul I know, but who are ye? And the man in whom the evilspirit was, leaped on them and prevailed against them, so that they fledout of that house, naked and wounded. And this was known to all theJews and Greeks also, dwelling at Ephesus, andfear fell on them all,and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified." [##Acts 19:13-17##]It would seem that the Christian world have learned a lesson fromthe reading of the foregoing passages, as they no longer attempt tocast out devils or heal the sick by the laying on of hands in the nameof Jesus, knowing only too well that they have no authority to do so,and fearing the consequences as dire to themselves, either by receivingsuch punishment as was meted out to the sons of Sceva or by thus reveal-ing the fact that they were unauthorized of God, expose themselves tothe just resentment of their deceived and misguided followers.SALVATION FOR THE DEAD.In this age of religious freedom when every man is at liberty toworship how, where or what he pleases, when the Christian Church issplit and divided into innumerable sects and creedsand is still divid-ing and subdividing; where the opinions of men, crystalized into creeds,pass current as systems of theological truths; while spiritualism in allits various forms is rampant upon the earth, and its younger and moredelicately molded brother, theosophy, is just bursting forth as awonderful revelation from the unseen world, while darkness covers theeatrth and gross darkness the people, and the men are continually seek-ing for that which borders upon the sensational, the word of God comesforth proclaiming the principles of salvation for the dead as well as for the living. That there is but one faith, one hope, one baptism, oneway to obtain eternal life, either for the living or for the dead, isclearly shown by the Scriptures. "To the law and to the testimony; ifthey speak not according to this word it is because there is no lightin them." (##Isaiah 8|Isaiah 8##, ##Isaiah 20|20##). This shall be our guide, by this divine 
 method we are willing that all might be judged. Opinuions of men arenot the words of God, nor is the word of God to receive a private inter-pretation as is clearly shown by the following: "Knowing this firstthat no prophecy of the Scriptures is of any private interpretation.For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy menof God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." [##2 Peter 1:20-21##] Opinions of menshall not then prevail, but we will take the word of God for our gGuide,"And when they shall say unto you, seek unto them that have familiarspirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter, should not a peopleseek unto their God for the living to the dead?" (##Isaiah 8:19|Isa. 8, 19##) Let usto the Scriptures then, and seek the word of God for a knowledge of the dead.After Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, fulfilled His missionamong the living and was about to depart to the unseen world and per-form his work for the salvation of the dead; while he was suffering thepangs of death upon the cross between two malefactors, he was railedupon by one, yet worshiped by the other, to whom He said: "To-day shaltthou be with Me in Paradise. [##Luke 23:43##] This saying has created a belief in theChristian world that the vilest sinner on his death-bed or the murdererupon the gallows by confessing Christ at the alast moment can be saved.But let us find out what became of the thief. Where did he go? Toheaven? Not if the Scriptures are true. On the morning of the Savior'sresurrection and Mary's visit to the sepulcher, she thought Jesus to bethe gardener. Yet when He said "Mary" she at once recognized Him and in her joy evidently sought to embrace Him, for it is said, "Jesus saithunto her: touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but goto my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and yourFather and to my God and your God." (##John 20:17|John 20, 17##) If this be true, aarewe not justified in asking the question, "Lord, if thou hast not beento they Father and God during those three days, where has though been,and where didst thou take that thief?" Let the Scriptures answer. Men's opinions are worthless on such vital questions. "For Christ also hathonce suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring usto God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spiritby which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison, whichsometime were disobedient when once the long suffering of Noah Godwaited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing, wherein few,that is, eight souls were saved by water." (##1 Peter 3:18-20|I Peter 3, 18-20##) So thenChrist took the thief to the spirit world and there undoubtedlypreached the Gospel to him in connection with Noah's people. And why?"For for this cause was the Gospel preached to them that are dead, thatthey might be judged according to men in the flesh but live accordingto God in the Spirit." [##1 Peter 4:6##] It would seem that this can need no explanationfor by this rule all men are to be judged by the same law, whether theyhear the Gospel in life or after death. And herein is the justice ofAlmighty God made manifest, for if it were not so, and if the modernChristianity theory should prevail, viz.—that all mankind who do notconfess Christ are lost—what shall be said of four-fifths of thepeople on the earth to-day, and those that have lived in like circum-stances in the heathen world, who never heard of Christ? If, when allmankind are brought before the judgment-seat to be judged, and theheathen hears his sentence read by the 
 great Judge, "Depart from Me, ye cursed, into the place prepared forthe devil and his angels, because you never confessed My name." [##Matthew 25:41##] Wouldnot that heathen be justified in saying, "Who are thou? I never heardof Jesus Christ. When I was on the earth I worshipped Joss and servedhim faithfully." To punish the heathen for not confessing Christ whenin fact he had never heard of him, is contrary to the justice of an all-wise Creator. But God has provided a better way. All who have neverheard the Gospel in life will have an opportunity after death, asclearly set forth in the above as in the following: "Verily, verily Isay unto you, the hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hearthe voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live." [##John 5:25##]"But,"says the objector, "that means all they that are dead in sin," but reada little farther: "Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in thewhich all that are in the graves shall hear His voice." (##John 5:28|John 5, 25 and28##) Again, "For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale'sbelly, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth." (##Matthew 12:40|Mat. 12, 40##). By these passages it is clearlyapparent that the Savior fore-knew His mission to the spirit world inthe heart of the earth, and that while there, all who were in theirgraves would hear His voice. Not only was this understood by Jesus andHis Apostles, but long prior to the Savior's day, the Prophets foresawthe work He would do for the dead, viz: "I the Lord have called theein righteousness, and will hold thine hand and will keep thee, and givethee for a covenant toof the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to openthe blind eyes, to bring out the 7 prisoners from the prison, and themthat sit in darkness out of the prison house." (##Isaiah:42:6-7|Isaiah 42, 6-7##). Herethe prophet foretold the labors of the Savior. During His sojourn inthe flesh, we have no account of His having brought out the prisonersfrom the prison, or proclaiming liberty to the captives, or the opening of the prison to them that are bound. Had hHe done so, the Roman Gov-ernment would have had a case against Him, yet Pilate found no fault inHim. Hence we must look elsewhere for the fulfillment of these pass-ages. "And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall punishthe host of the high ones that are on high and the kings of the earthupon the earth, and they shall be gathered together as prisoners aregathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison and after manydays shall they be visited." (##Isaiah 26:21-22|Isaiah 26, 21-2##). Here is the final of aterrible picture of the earth's desolation, when it is to be empty,turned up-side-down, broken, dissolved, removed like a cottage, and theinhabitants thereof scattered. All are to be gathered, including thekings and the high ones, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, shut upin prison and after many days visited. What will be the object of thisvisitation? Peter has already told it, as Christ visited the antide-luvians, so when these have suffered the vengeance of almighty God inthe spirit ^world,^ some of His servants, ministering angels, will be sent tovisit them and preach the Gospel to them as Jesus did. "lift ^up^ yourheads, Oh ye gates, and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and theKing of glory shall come in. Who is this king of glory? The Lord strong 
 and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle." (Psalm 24, 7-8). What wasthe subject of the vision thus portrayed by the prophet and where wasit to take place? He saw the Savior making His triumpjhial entry intothe infernal regions, and with irresistable power the gates and doorsare made to fly open, and the immortal King stands in the midst of theprisoners of the spirit world. Thus the full import of that beautifulpassage of the psalmist David would read: List up your heads, oh yegates of hell, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors of the prisonsof the damned, and the King of glory shall come in, to the regions ofdarkness proclaiming liberty to the captives and the opening of theprison doors to them that are bound in hell. If the antideluvians aftertheir long sojourn in the regions of darkness were had in remembrancebefore God so that He sent His beloved Son to preach to them the Gospelduring the time His body lay in the tomb, what shall be done for thosewho have died since the Savior's visit to the spirit world? As HisApostles and all His faithful followers served Him in life, who shallsaty that after death they will not follow His example, and continue toserve Him by going to the spirit world and there preaching to thespirits in prison who have died without a knowledge of the Gospel? Andwhen these poor benighted beings after their long captivity under thereign of Lucifer, listen to the precious truths of the Gospel of Christand become converted, straightway the question arises, How can I obeythe ordinances of baptism? I am in a disembodied state of existence,yet my Savior has said: "Except ye are born of the water and of thespirit ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of God." Oh wonderful planprovided by the Almighty! The living may be baptized for the dead. Itis very plain that this great principle was understood by the ancientSaints as will be seen by the words of the Apostle Paul addressed tothe Corinthians: "Else what shall they do which are baptized for thedead if the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for thedead?" (I Cor. 15, 29)

 OFFICE OF The First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day SaintsP.O. Box. B.Salt Lake City, Utah.May 1, 1891.President L. W. Shurtliff,C. H. Middleton and N. C. Flygare.Dear Brethren:The case that is now pending either before the High Council or Bishop'sCourt in which Elders Job Pingree and Nathan Tanner, jr. are parties, has been brough[t]to our attention. A copy of the resolution adopted by the High Council, and by which these parties were suspended from the privileges of the priesthood, and to a certainextent from membership in the church, has also been submitted to us. By this actionthese brethren are practically disfellowshipped; and Brother Nathan Tanner, jr. feelsvery deeply the serious consequences which attend the adoption of this resolution,and has appealed to us for relief. We do not know what reasons you had for taking this action previous to the hearing of the case, but naturally suppose you must havehad good reasons or you would not have adopted a resolution that is so unusual if no[t]extraordinary; but whatever reasons may be we think immediate steps should be taken [to]have the case tried and some decision reached concerning it so that these brethrenmay not be kept  in a position so exceedingly unpleasant to every one who values his standing in the church and in the priesthood. It may be that the parties themselvesare to blame for the delay; if they are they should be urged to take immediate action.If the delay be due to either of the tribunals, then we suggest that no time be lostin giving the case a hearing, as the passing of the resolution adopted by the council was three months ago. With kind regasrds,Your brethren,W WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F. Smith 
 Elder Woodruff made a few remarks, he said that thescripture doctrine was now reversed, where it said that a prophetwas not without honor save in own Country, for the whole nationwith the world to back them had risen up for the destruction of ourleaders and to break up this Church and Kingdom. He felt thathe would like to have some Angels or personages sent to occupythis Hall and the buildings in this City and throughout thisTerritory dedicated to the Lord, so that if our enemies came hereto desecrate our habitations and our public buildings the Angelsof the Almighty might be here to trouble them. He believed in the principle of dedicating this Hall to God. He felt that he wantedto dedicate his house and to pray that he might get the Holy Ghost upon him to such a degree that every ungodly man whoshould enter might be troubled. We have built and plantedand occupied our possessions a considerable time in peace in theseValleys and his prayer was that the Lord might bless us andgive continually his Holy Spirit, that we may learn to appreciateour blessings and privileges, and that we may so close to Godas to realize that we are his friends, and though this people maybe called to pass through straight places he was satisfied that itit was for the purpose of becoming more acquainted with thelaws of God; to secure our salvation and exaltation; to openthe way for the spread of the Gospel and the extension of the Kingand he felt that it was all right. This is a good room and isbuilt with taste and at considerable expense, and if we donot occupy it we shall get a reward, and somebody has gotto pay for these things; he believed it will cost a greater billbefore we get through with it, and he felt satisfied that thisvery room will be one means of ripening the world for the harves[t]We have heretofore had towns, hamlets, cities counties andStates to rise up against us, but never before had to stem thi[s]tide of the persecution of a whole nation. but our course isonward and we shall prevail over the combined powers of earth and hell, he was satisfied of this and he prayed thatwe might take hold of it like good soldiers.

The work is new here and all of the powers are arrayed against it and unless we have aid until we have become self sustaining, we will be a long time making a little show.  This is a large city and much advertising willhave to be done to ge the Gospel before the people.  If we fail to reach the peopleand make their food pallitable, we will not be remembered for our successes.  We feelsure of prosperity in this mission, for I believe that the harvest here is ripe, but owing to the natures of the elements which surround us here, we will have to have men and machinery to save the grain.  I thoroughly believe that this mission will become self sustaining but it may be some time.  I also believe that the means spent here will be a rich investment, and after a few days will return with an abundant increase.

Iwish there were some more of such men to comeand labor among their relatives if only for a few months.Yes! I have moved to the address of 118-10th St. Whilewe held services on 29-11th St, a family of peoplehad to live in the rooms below to reduce the rent, andwe roomed there ^with Bro. Mortensen^. When we changed our place oforholding services—we had to move. We have two roomsat the present, on the second floor. A front room whichwe use for a bed-room and sleepingr sitting room, anda back room which we use for a kitchen. They cost us$15.00 a month. Any time Sister Tanner goes homeI can give up the kitchen, but a front room alone will cost$12.00. I have been to a great many places that were for rentand this is the best I could get. Rent seems very high.I have tried to investigate the nature of things hereand I think we need women here as well as men. If we could have a few ^worthy^ young men just marriedor with a small family called and sent here to help us thoroughly

 establish ourselves and make a solid foot hold here I think it would be a very wise thing. There are youngmen ^(with small families)^ in Utah, who could do much good here. If theyre couldbe such called here, who are propessional men and locatehere for a time, we would do well. I feel that it wouldbe a wise thing to do, if we intend to locate permanentlyin San Francisco. I am anxious to know if youfavor the idea.

She can alsohelp me in many ways now that she is here; but ifyou think she should return to her people, informeme concerning the matter.

 Liverpool.May 10th, 1884.President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City,Utah.Dear Brother:Your very welcome of march 15th came safely to handso I wrote to you on the 20th of march, I have delayed answering you until now, not having of interest to write. I am of the opinion that the Legislature would have done well to have allowed the Governors action to have killed the Appropriation bill and have thrownthe responsibility upon him. I was also hoping that some spirited member would collect together a list of his infamous [s]ets both of a private and public nature and in a speach upon the floor of the house brand him as a villain, and club him with his own vile record, and have the same go upon the record, it is very likely however that memorial to Congress may answer every purpose. I am pleased to hear that the Indians in the south are taking hold on the Gospel, I trust that much good may come of it. We are just informed by the papers today that Miss Emily Faithfull is going to [lecture] against us in June, showing that the Ladies in Utah are in most fearful slavery or bondage. 
 The papers also says that one of our brethren has been sentenced to one months imprisonment at Viena for missionary work in that country. We had learned some days ago that this would be the case but Bro J. Q Cannon thought it would be for a much longer periodThe Elders who left home on April 15th came safely and had a very pleasant journey. Your son has been assigned to labor for the present in the Manchester Conference under the Presidency of Elder W D. Williams one of my most efficient Elders, I feel much pleased with the spirit manifested by him and the other young brethren. I feel certain that they will do much good just as soon as they get at work and fully interested. The spring has been cold and windy with but little rain, we could not hold outdoor meetings without endangering the health of the brethren.Tomorrow I attend meeting at Lowestoft the most easterly point of England and the former home of father Neslin, he built a small chapel for the saints there, but it has passed out of their hands. I must be off. We held a meeting in Shield Park and a few stopped and listened to us You will please give any kind regards to Bros Richards, Jaques and Pratt and any other who may enquire after me. Please remember me kindly to your family. My wife and child are well.With kind regard to you I am you brother in the Gospel.John Henry Smith 
 ^Liverpool^November 18th [188]4President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake CityDear Brother:Your very welcome letter of September 23rd came safely to hand, finding us on the enjoyment of good health and spirits. We published the items in your letter, correctingsome errors, that had appeared in the article that you wrote to us giving advice to young elders. I have not written to you for some time, from the fact that I had [littl[eof interest to communicate. Our missionary businessmoves quietly along here in Great Brittain. Since the killing of our brethren in Tennessee, the press of this country have been publishing all manner of vile stories on in regard to us. The P. P. Pratt and McLean affair, having figured prominently, in the articles that have been written from some quartersand garbled extracts from the Journal of discourses and Millennial Star, have been brought forward to sustain the charges made against us, and if possible to destroy the little seed sown. Quite a number of parties are also lecturing against us, among them Miss Emily Faithful, who paid a visit to our City I think in 1883. 
 Salt Lake Septr 25 [18]86.Prest. Wilford WoodruffDear Brother:Yesterday wecalled upon Albert Carrington,by request of Franklin D. Richardsand had some conversation withhim in regard to his case; he sayshe is willing to do anything requiredof him, if he can only be rebaptized.We found him quite feable, beingjust able to walk across the room,he claims to have paid his tithingand attended to his prayersregularly, always rememberinghis brethren, he harbors nofeelings against any one, andbears his testimony to the truthof the work, he will sign awritten complaint confession,admitting that he was guilty of 
 She has taken up the Mountain Meadow business, the Statements of Apostate mormon women and askes them up and deals them out to the gaping crowd—her standing in society gives some weight to her utterances. It is hardly possible though for her to do us any particular injury, as her stories are of the old class having been exploded a hundred times. Another person by the name of Joseph Johnson is also regaling the people on the Isle of Man with a series of lectures in which he is retailing many things of a vile nature calculated to have a detrimental effect to the word in that part of the vineyard. He has secured quite a number of items in regard to family matters in Utah, to which he has added whatever the evil one might suggest to his mind,and with these he hopes to block up our way entirely on thelittle Isle. We have yet another, no less a person, than the notorious William Jarman, "who by the way is not far removed from insanity," he is travelling around the country, lecturing and giving an exhibition of some pictures, representing scenes as he claims have occured in the west. If I remember correctly I sent you a copy of the book from which he lectures, he takes particular pains to go wherever we have a branch of the church, rent a Hall, challenge our Elders to meet him, and whether they go or not, he attends our meetings on the sabbath day, listens quietly to what has been said till the services are over, and then commences an harrangue to the people, in which he uses such vile dirty language in regard to the endowments, and other things held sacred by us, that it is impossible for any one with any spirit to put apart it. I have instructed the elders and saints to keep away from his meetings, and that if he came to ours not to permit him to enter our Halls. On the 14th I received the following.John Henry Smith. Latter day devil Office, 42 Islington, Liverpool. Shall be in Liverpool shortly, when I shall require you to meet me in public debate, or prepare to leave Liverpool, for I shall not rest, so long as a missionary from Salt Lake remainsin Great Britain; I want you to discuss mormon doctrine and practice in Utah. you have my permanent address, have you any more letters from my ex wife yet. Wm JarmanThis fiend seems to be fully infused in the work he has taken in hand, and is laboring with satanic zeal, to excite the public mind against us. I am of the opinion however, that he crushed the mark so far, that no honest man can possible be deceived by his stories. I am at the present time settling in my own mind, what course to pursue in regard to sending an elder or two to Constantinople, and have about reached the conclusion, to have 
 adultry and asking the people toforgive him, he is not able, he says,to go before the public.Bro Grant cannot feel thatAlbert Carrington is humble or thathe fully appreciates the the greatcrime that he has committed,Bro.

GrantP.S.We feel that Albert Carringtonis gradually losing his mind 
 Bro Spori who speaks the English, French, and German I beleive, go there. I feel impressed with the idea that some good will be accomplished. I shall however be compelled to assist him from this Office, as I am of the opinion he is unable to help himself. I shall drop later in Italy for the present, brother Andrew Villet spent a year there, and absolutely accomplished nothing. The people of that land are being scourged and it may be that after a time, some interest may be awakened.France was also dead to all the efforts made by Bro Bunotto get a foothold in that land. Brother Schoenfeld writes quite hopeful in regard to Austria, and I have written to him to have brother Beisinger make his way quickly again into that country and see, wether is is possible it is possible to make an opening. By letter from Elder Tanner from Berlin. I learn that there is a little opening in eastern Prussia, made by a local Elder, and that hopes are entertained quite an opening will be secured there,Brother Smoot has sufferred a little term of impresionment at Kiel for baptising a young girl under age. The Authorities of Bavariadrove the Elders from there as fast as we send them in, and in Switzerland, some spirit of antagonism is felt. By letters from Brothers Willes, McCune, and Pratt, India, that the prospects are not very bright there—that the man Booth, who went with them, has been cut off from the church. The brethren find a few old time saints, who are very generous, and hope that the way will open up, by which they will accomplish some good. Scandinavia is still alive and baptisms are occurring regularly in the various parts of that mission. I now have 3 Elders in Ireland, and they report their prospects as being very good about 35 persons has been baptized in Belfast, and neighborhood and the prospects are good for more. The Elders that left home on the 11th of October, and also those who left on the 29th, reached here in Safety, all being in good health, having enjoyed themselves aside from a little seasickness, they have all been appointed to and gone forward to their various fields. Now comes their time of getting climated, and weaned from home, and its comforts, which, takes about 6 months in that time we usualy learn whether mens health will bear up in this climate or whither it is best for them to return home. The great struggle with the Elders now a days is to keep from getting discouraged, over their lack of success, nervous, active men, like to have some showing for their labor, and when they struggle for several months, without any seeming results, without they have got the pluck of a Paul, or the patienceof Job, they either tire out, become dispondent, and are anxious to go home. I have tried in every way to make

 July 30 [188]4President Wilford Woodruff.Salt Lake CityDear Brother.Yours of July 10th came safely to hand and found uswell here in the office. The Article we were pleased to receive.It will give encouragement to the Elders many of whom arelaboring without any seeming return—bonds of warning exhortat[io]n Counsell or testimony are received with grattitude by us allMany if us are young men Some men advanced in years butyoung in experience in the ministry and when Elders likeyourself grown grey in the service drop words of encouragementor counsell or Iexplain your own experiences they help usto despel our own little troubles and take gold with renewedvigir to push forward the cause of our God. It is the hardestthing that an Elder has to do to day to keep from becomingdespondent. for to travel from weeks end to weeks end withoutgathering any fruit requires a man to posess in a largedegree the sunshine if the Holy spirit in his composition.Elder W D Williams President of the Manchester Conference speaksin high terms of the earnestness your son displays in performing 
 I received letters from J.F. yesterday, he was quite well when he wrote.Our enemies are feeling quite fabulous over Bp Sharps fall.  They are making every effort they can to catch me. but have failed up to the presant.  I expect several of the brethren of the Twelve will attend conference at Logan.  The Mexican business thus far is all a failure, no land yet.I feel that the present pressure upon us was very necessary where we see so many of the brethren go to the wall willing to cry enoughI am happy and well and pray the Lord to bless and ^prosper^ you.  May you have the revelations of the Lord to guide you in all of your movements.I am your fellow servant in Christ.John Henry Smith 
 every mans mission successful, by persuading them to remain at their post, faithful and true. this can be done in most instances, but occasionally it is impossible to [revive] men.Your suggestion in regard to outdoor preaching, I had already put into practice by warning the elders to keep watch upon each other and to give advice when either was taking hurt,from over exertion on the score named. When elders get off to themselves, they are sometimes filled with Zeal and injure themselves without anyone knowing that they are in the least taking hurt. I have very little faith in the outdoorpreaching as to the good that will result therefrom. All we can accomplish by it is warning the people. In the past 2 Years I believe but 2 persons have come forward and received the ordinances of the gospel as the result of the outdoor work so far as I can learn. And it is a granquestion in my mind, whether we aint doing more harm to our Elders by keeping them in this labor, than we are doing good to the human family by warning them in this manner. I have however felt to crowd the brethren to this work, as the only means by which they could get an experience in public speaking, and bring out within them full faith and a reliance upon God, for no extremely timid man can stand the racket, and face these crowds of people and testify to the mission of Joseph Smith. It requiresiron nerves and iron wills. Some of the Conferences in England are becoming very thinly populated, Norwich Conference,has left it it, only about 30 active members. The Bristol Conference which takes in Cornwall, and several other counties is said to only furnish 4 beds to the elders without paying for them. The Leeds Conference is nearly in the same [fix's] In these conferences where there are but few people I have crowded the elders out, so that they might open make openings where the gospel has not been preached for some years to any great extent, they dont however meet with any great success, and report that they are either compelld theirtheir beds, buy their food, or remain out in the weather, and suffer from hunger, portions of other conferences of the mission continue to do pretty well in furnishing places to sleep and something to eat for the elders, but the day seem to be gone by, when the saints take any responsibility in aiding to clothe them, other portions of these conferencesseem to be barren and fruitless. At the present time, trade is very bad, in ^all^ the Ship building sections of the country thousands of men ar out of employment, and as a result of this, great distress, is felt in their families 
 his duty, he is a young man of considerable promise and will no doubt bring gladness to your heart for his faithfulnessand fidelity in the field. There can be no greater joy to a Fatherthat has devoted his life to the interest of a cause that heknows is true than to have his children ceasing hold of theiron rod and following in the paths of honour—continuing his work and perpetuating his name. I am becoming very muchinterested in trying to open up a mission to Turkey. I have been inCorrespondence for some months with a Turkish gentlemanone of whose letters I sent to Bro Taylor some time ago. I herewithenclose one to you—I would like two missionaries, men whohave some taste for learning languages, and who could go tothat country and make a successful effort in introducing thegospel in that land. You may have already considered thisMatter, but you can read the letter to the brethren in order thatthey may judge of the spirit of it. I am pleased that Congress has again adjourned which will give the country a little peaceIt is a fearful thing that the people should stand in dread oftheir lawmakers, and but for the faith of the saints in God theycertainly would. England is passing through another trying experiencein her political affairs. The Liberal ministry has tryed to enfranchise2 Millions of Men—the law passed the commons, but the House ofLords, have made an effort to stop the law, not daring to reject itentire, they have tied it up in some form which prevents for thepresent at least its passage. Popular demonstrations are theorder of the day—and while this is done peaceable there ismuch clamour among the masses for a change in the consti-tution which will do away with the House of Lords ormake them elective by the people. You have no doubt seenin the Telegrams, the unearthing of some scandals in Dublin.It seems to be an open secret, that quite a number of Gentlemen moving in higher circles are charged with thecrime of sodomy. These parties have been arrested and arebeing quietly investigated, that crime will bring transporta-tion for life if proven guilty. One of the Judges of the AssignCourt of this County was found dead in a home of Ill famea few days ago. He died in the arms of his paramour—thisalso is being secretly investigated. Cholera and small poxor talk of them at least seems to be in the very air. Our nextCompany will leave on August 30th, there will be in theneighbourhood of 30 returning elders, most of them will havebeen away from home nearly two years—and have labord asa rule to the best of their ability. Some men are not missionariesand they cannot help it doing the best they can in the circumstances in which they are placed. Young men should be sent here 
 I am pleased to report to you that your son is an earnest and efficient laborer in the vineyard, and he is making every effort possible to qualify himself to become a polished shaft in the hands of the Almighty for the preaching of the gospel to the nations. I look upon him as one of my most promising elders. I intend changing him after a little while to the London Conference, which will extend his experience and give him some extended ideas in regard to men & things. Young Utah are gems in the field if they only get a proper send off. We see by the papers that old satan is very active. He no doubt got a little set back however on the 4th of November. It is a little singular that a fellow who hath Republican tendencies should be inclined to shout hurah when a Democrat comes into power, not that I expect any particular changes from the efforts of the new man, but while the devil is stopping to spit on his hands the Kingdom of God is gaining strength You no doubt had an excellent time at Conference and that the Lord was with you in power all the brethren testify who speak of being there. I have 3 elders in the mission who have been out over two years I shall release them to return home sometime during the winter. My health and spirits are first class I have overtaxed my eyes a little with study, but they will be all right when they have a little rest Give my kind regards to all the brethren and accept a share yourself.I am your fellow laborer in the vineyard of our LordJohn Henry Smith 
 because: better able to stand the climate, the poor food, longwalks, sometimes poor beds, and sometimes no beds. ElderReid of Ogden informs me he is 67 years of age andhe finds it impossible for him to put up with the hardshipincident to missionary life. his spirit is willing but hisflesh is weak. Elders Geo Goddard and Edward Stevensonare making an ernest effort in Leicester their old homethey have hopes of accomplishing some good altho their firstmeetings they regarded as almost failures so far as attendancewas concerned. We are continuing our outdoor preaching whenthe wheather permits, it having been quite rainy for two weekspast. has interifered with us some. The prospect of crops at presentis moderately good. Farmers are harvesting. In the some of theManufacturing districts business is very dull—quite a numberof our people are out of employment in various places.

 -[Updated letter, but written sometime in December 1888, perhaps Dec. 5.]-President W. Woodruff and the Apostles:I desire to inform you of our condition in this ward; last week dureing the heavy Rains we had the largest freshet we have had (sinece 1878) which took out about half of our Dam., and as there are only 15 families liveing here they feel some what Discouraged, and feel it a heavy labor to put the Dam in without any asistance, and should any more leave it would be still harder for us to maintain our location here. The present Dam was put in with Piles about 4 years ago and has stood the freshets very well, we repaired it last summer and it appeared quite safe, our People began to think we had the Dam Perminant and have some pretty good substantial homes and farms, our lands seems to yeald very well when it is properly tilled, I am confident if we had as many more settlers we could establish a very good place here, and sustain our selves very well, as we have had plenty water the driest seasons and there is plenty land to take up by Home-stead or Premption, the most of the land we farm is held by Homesteads, the Health of the People is excelent and a good spirit Prevails, ever Praying for the Prosperity of Zion I am your Brother,John Bushman, Bp. 
 Sunset, Apache Co. Arizona, Nov. 24, 1879.Dear Brother Tenney;I received your communication on Saturday night at the Springs 40 miles west of here. I arose early in the morning and came to Sunset at night and have counseling with Pres. Lot Smith concerning your purchase with Mr. Barth and our united voice is for you to accept his proposals But we would like to know what that 2 1/2 acres is reserved for and by whom. Cannot that be included in the pur-chase? And again does the purchase include all the water right of the creek or does the west side hold claims to a part of the waters of the creek? Brother Smith and myself both would rather you would buy out all the water right of the town if you can. If the people hold the right on the west side of the creek will they not claim the surplus water and play the Stinson game on us and still occupy the west side and let their cattle run over our crops. We would like to understand, as far as we can, cooncerning all these matters. We would rather buy out the place if we could so as to make a Mormon town of it, and not be mixed with Jews, Mexicans and Gentiles.I am satisfied that Barth is a sharper and will get all he can and you will have to be careful and in making the purchase with him do not let him have a loop hole to crawl out, and if you can get the 2 1/2 acres you had better get it. I know he is a slippery man but if anybody can trade with him I know you can. I wish You would send me a letter by the bearer and answer the foregoing questions. If your purchases will take all the water of the creek, if not what portion? Will there be any water claim on the west, if so how much? Does Barth own the 2 1/2 acres and what does he want to keep it for? Will he ^not^ have a hold on a part of the water to make us trouble? We would like information upon all these points. Will there be surplus water for him or anybody else to claim to make us trouble?We would like you to buy all the water rights of the place if possible. We think we can back you up so as to make the purchase. Is sSt. Johns surveyed by the U. S. surveyors? You say the 2 1/2 acres is on the edge of town on the east side of the creek. I thought the village was on the west side of the river. Does your purchase include the dwellings or any of them? We would like an explanation of all these things. Brother Smith is anxious to have you buy out of the whole town if you could, if not get all the water rights you can.Of course you will not have a chance to consult with us about anything after you get this until you get your purchase made, but do the best you can and whatever bargain you make bind it with a band of iron so strong that noone can break it. Write by the bearer all you can about it and as soon as you get the bargain send me word by mail.I shall write to Brother Taylor immediately and tell him to have mis-sionaries who are coming to take possession of the place to bring cows with them of the age you speak of. Do not fail to make the purchase if possible. I Tthink that is all I need to say upon the subject. With regard to occupying the Colorado Meadows, there should be means taken immediately to occupy the place by the brethren. We are now making arrangements to fit up teams and send 2 from Sunset, 2 from Bringham City and will call for 1 from St. Joseph and 4 perhaps from Snowflake and will send what we can to you to take up the Meadow forth with, but we shall want you to go with them to go with them to Greers and help them settle or locate and Gilbert Greer might make a claim and I want these brethren to locate their claims so as to exclude the St. Johns folks from getting a hold there. 
 We will start them off forthwith and send them to you. I want all these things kept as secret as possible until we get the place secured. We have concluded to start 4 men tomorrow morning to St. Joseph and from there to Brother Greers and Brother Brookbank will take the letter to you from St. Joseph. You will find him a No. 1 man and I want him to be with you in the mission, I know you can work together like a charm and I now want to say to you once for all this is the voice of all our Council and if you want any more,I wilol say it is the Will of the Lord that Ammon M. Tenney preside over this mission. Therefore make no more excuse but round up your shoulders and receive this mission and appointment and God will bless you and make you an instrument in his hands of bringing many of the House of Israel into the Church and Kingdom of God, who will be saved through your instrumentality. Therefore, go to, unitewith your brethren and lead out in this work and open your mouth, preach the Gos-pel to the Lamanites or Nephites as you find them and prophecy unto them as you shall be led by the power of God and the Lord will stand by you and you will be able to accompllish all that your heart desires in righteousness.As Brother Brookbank will not return, but will stop with you, therefore send your communications to me by mail, unless there is a private conveyance open. I want the Meadows taken possession of about the same time you buy St. Johns or a little before so that they cannot get possession. Now if you make any change in your purchase of St. Johns notify me immediately as I may want to write to President Taylor.Concerning your going to St. Johns with your family; if you purchase perhaps you had better go there and take possession of it. But I want you to go with the Brethren to Brother Greer's and scatter them through the Meadow and take up all the desirable places as fast as the brethren come. I do not intend to let daylight, dark night or grass grow under my feet to stop me trying to do my duty or helping to settle Arizona or  New Mexico or bringing the House of Israel into the Kingdom of God—not if I know it.I would like you to instruct the missionaries in Spanish eor council them to improve their time in it what you can. I have thought of asking you what you would think trying to buy out that Mexican at the Spring where we got a drink of water as we came into Meadow. It might do no harm to try. I do not think of anything more at this time.My love and blessings to your wives, children, mother, brother and friends.Yours Brother in the GospelLewis Allen. (Wilford Woodruff)PRIVATE: I am going to write to Brother Greer to assist the brethren to locate the Meadow. Now I do not know how much of the Spirit of Zion he has got. His son Gilbert has the Spirit of his mission. I think if he has and can locate a claim with the rest it might be well for them to do it. I would like you to see how Brother Greer is and if he feels like it I would like him to help what he can in it.I have given Brother Gilbert Greer a notification of his appointment as a missionary to the Lamanites under your direction. I would like him to take hold immediately with you and perhaps he can assist you in your temporal affairs. Some of these missionaries who will go to the Meadows who to make claims as far as they can I want them to enter upon their missions as soon as convenient. 
 I do not wish to make any presidency in this mission separate from the presiding officers of these Stakes, so while I am in the country I will give you ^what^ council I can, but you may consider yourself under the Presidency of Jesse N. and Lot Smith, but while any of the twelve are in the country it is their province to give counsel upon all these matters as far as they have an oppor-tunity.I am soon expecting Brigham Young and several others from the north, before long and we may call and visit you.L.

Galbraith from Sligo Ireland, who is a Priest in the Liverpool Branch and who is desirous to make himself useful in assisting in the building up of the kingdom of God on the earth in any manner that his time or talents can be made available. As he is comparatively a stranger I have taken the liberty to introduce him unto you in the hope there may be a vacancy in some of the Latter-day Saint schools where his talent might be available as he has been very successful amongst children and takes much pleasure in that profession and believes that Theology should be one of the principle subjects in education as the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.Trusting you will pardon the liberty I have taken and kindly consider the interest I have in the young & rising generation, I remainYour brother in the gospelGeorge Teasdale

The companywithout counting the returning missionaries num-ber 176 souls 93 adults and 83 children (Thereis one amongst them who was baptized wheneight years old—he says—who has been sent forby his twin brother who is likely to be sent backhis appearance is so much against him raggedand rough. It is much to be regretted this kindof people are sent for, surely we have enoughof the vagobond element amongst us. The saintshave objected to his company so we have had 
 to berth him with the gentiles. We cannot beresponsible for this class. His name is AdolphPeter Hansen aged 21, Booked for Salt Lake City.All this I learn by representation which shouldbe reliable. It has pleased our heavenly Fatherto draw into His fold a young man who isthe son of a clergyman of the established Churchof England. He has been an earnest workerin education and in faith relying upon Godto provide the necessary means, for the indegent. His name is Thomas Richard Galbraith.He has been in the office a good deal and Ihave taken to him as an honest man. He isgoing to work his passage to New York hav-ing obtained a situation on the S. S. WyomingHe is a sailor having been apprenticed to thesea and travelled a good deal. He enteredas a sailor but the captain has placed himamongst the stewards. He was going to workuntil he obtained sufficient means to goto Utah but I have advanced him the moneyfeeling that his labors will be more valuable to us amongst the rising generation.He appears to be a gentleman, humble,prayerful and willing. Has quite a goodfaith and trust in God and improvesupon acquaintance although he has quitethe ministerial expression that he has beentrained in which will ^doubtless^ give way before the 
 natural education he will obtain throughassociation in the Kingdom of God. I shouldhave used him here in the work of the ministry, and he was quite willing, but I havereflected that it would be better for himto get a home in Zion and better educatedin true principle, with some experience inthe gospel to better qualify him for thatlabor. I have given him a letter of intro-duction to yourself so you may see himand if you think proper for him toengage in school keeping in the Latter-day Saints schools that he can do so. I have also given him a letter of introduc-tion to Bro. James Jack who could intro-duce him to yourself when convenient.This has been entirely my own arrangement Bro. Galbraith never asked sucha thing. He said if he could reach Utahhe was satisfied he could make his living and was going trusting inthe Lord, and this is what the Lord hasdone for him, for my natural suspiciousnature would have prompted me to takeno such course. I tell him he need notthank me for this but Him who hasso wrought upon me to take this step. 
 The future will unfold whether I have beenled right or not. So far as I am concernedI am willing to risk it for my impressionsare he will prove true blue. I regret toinform you that Bro Payne from Filmorenow laboring in London will have to re-turn through delicate health. With regardto Bro. Jas. Leaing he is the best missionarywe have in the field. He is doing anexcellent work in London presiding overthat Conference and if it would beagreeable to all we should be pleasedto keep him until next spring but if itis necessary he should return, why hewill leave in October. Bro. Payne is aworker, he is a first class missionary, andhas done a good work. Bro. Wm Kelson will have to return through ill healthHe is hardly capable for the hardships of missionary life in the British Isles.I am happy to say we are all reasonablywell at 42 and join in kind love toyourself Counsellors and brethren withyou. Hoping and praying for the re-demption of Zion I remain as ever:Yours very affectionately in the GospelGeorge Teasdale

U. Stucki of the Swiss and German Mission has been down with the small pox which he contracted in Bohemia at the house of Bro. Dittrich. He was travelling through the mission and taken sick while in Stuttgart with a heavy fever and chills, pains in his back and head which kept increasing on him until he broke out. He thought he had caught a severe cold and kept moving about filling his appointments being all the time exposed to heat causing sweatings and then to chilly winds, and made the trip from Basel to Bern in a draughty railway car. He mentioned these facts to show how miraculously he was healed by the power of God being so exposed to heat & cold. When he reached Bern Bro Brandley felt determined to wait on Pres Stucki and nurse him, as he had no fear. The Brethren administered to him and in less than two weeks he was up again comparativelywell, only weak. No one took the disease and no one in the house outside of our own folks knew that anyone had the disease. Bro. Stucki has hardly any marks from the effects of the disease. He has surely been very much blessed of our heavenly Father. 
 Bro Stucki reports that while he was in Reichenberg he sent for Bro. L. M. Cannon in Saxony as he thought it would be a good plan for Bro Dittritch to have some help, but through a couple of traitors in the Church a strong persecution arose. Bro. Dittritch was arrested for committing the crime of teaching an unauthor-ized religion, baptizing &c and the prospect was he would get perhaps a year and a half imprison-ment so he concluded to give them the slip and he was then in Bern. Four of his children had been sick with the small pox, one of them had died and his wife had been sick. His family is in a very pitiable condition alone amongst traitors and enemies, only a few Saints to sympathise and they too poor to render any assistance. Bro Cannon barlely escaped arrest. I think I have stated before that the Swiss and German Mission will require some more missionaries to relieve those who are going home in the fall. They will want at least seven good missionaries for the fall indeed the field is amply large for many more elders.Prest Stucki is an excellent missionary. He says "TheElders feel well everywhere and they are blessed in their labors more especially in South Germany Four ^persons^ have been baptized in Saxony who seem to be earnest and faithful. I am somewhat troubled about the Turkish Mission. I receive letters from BrosHintzie, J. M. Sjodabl, W. H. Smart and Locander With the exception of Bro. Hintzie and J. M. Sjodabl 
 IIthey do not seem to have much faith in the Turkish Mission or in Bro Hintze. They say he tells the people too much from pre-existence to Adam being the God of this earth and that God is only man perfected. The principle topic is a coloni-zation scheme, means for printing, and  house rent and "backshish" which I am informed "is absolutely necessary." Bro Hintze says "I cannot say what we may need in means because it is all so uncertain where a government is to be bought with money. Then I do not know what to apply for without knowing what our brethren will sustain. Excuse me for a suggestion. As the whole matter now stands, and as it is of great importance would it not be better that you and the Presidency at home see me face to face so as to make proper arrangementsas to our efforts here? It would save me anstime and anxiety." The above subjects of those wants of the mission and schemes for gettingthe gospel before. the people, all requiring meansare what the letters I receive are composed of.Bro. Clove is returning sick. Just aboutthe time he has some smattering of the lan-guage enough to converse he is obliged toreturn. I watched to see binic until I wrote to you but concluded to write for the prospectof acertaining how far I am at liberty to go 
 in the using of means for instead of one establishment there are three expecting to draw on this office. One in Constantinopleone in Aintab and one in Palestine. With the exception of Bro. Sjodabl the brethren do not seem, to have much faith in the Turkish Mission only to kill time. They have got the experience of Elder Clove and have seen how he has passed his time and of the labors of Elder Hintze and his experience, seen the class of converts who have professed to become converted and got acquainted with the opposition of all around them and the absence of any interest manifested that they do not write very encouraging let-ters. If you have noticed any commanica-tions from the elders in that mission it has been about the manners and customs of the people as they view it. Letters that seem to have been written for a consideration to help them to a little means in their needy condition. But so far as missionary labors are concerned they do not seem to have much to write about. I would be pleased to hear from you how far you will be willingI should supply this mission with means beecause they have drawn upon us to consume all the three hundred dollars appropriated. I wrote to Prest Hintze asking about how much he thought it would need for publishing some tracts &c and 
 IIItelling him that I did not think we wanted to buy the government for the sake of the privilege to preach the gospel, that called for the remarks I have quoted from his letter. Some time ago the brethren got some printing done in germany and all the tracts were confiscated. In No 34 Star we have publish-ed a letter from Prest Hintze. I think some policy should be defined with regard to this Mis-sion. Prest H. writes Our house rent £5.0.9 is again due and I have no M. funds only to rely upon your assistance until all affiers matters are settledI extract a portion of his letter for your considerationTurkey is a long way from home. It takes over $20000 perhaps $250 00/100 to reach here. Most elders are stripped when they arrive (I was even without the necessary means to reach Constantinopleand may as well state right here that I have no present resources to raise funds. I am therefore forced to look for assistance to me a continual regret) There for the elders to go into the interior and live takes another good round sum Hence the fact is we arrive poor, and we nearly all need assistance from home in some way, and that assistance is not forth coming. Therefore we havehad to ask your assistance. For instance my Bp.was especially instructed by Apostles F. D. Richards 
 and John H. Smith to assist me and when I wrote to him about the twenty pounds I personally bor-rowed of your office he did not even answer; He is not a bad man but I understand my case is among the common ones." Well I think I have said enough about the Turkish Mission. If it was now a question of dollars and dimes I should hesitate to bother you with so long a letter. The ani-mormons have been breathing out threatnings and this office is watched.We are all well in health and spiritsat present. Bro. Brookband has been quite unwell but is better. We keep sending BroJohn L. papers when there is anything of interest. Bro. C. D. Fjeldsted writing from Copenhagen Aug 12, says "There is quite an opposition started in the Aalborg Conferenceall the Utah brethren except two having been called before the police authoritiesand one already received his sentence of banishment. Will inform you further as soon as we learn particulars." The elders had been successful in baptizing a member and it aroused the priests so the brethren said.With kindest regards to yourself, Counsellors and all with you, I remain as everYour brother in the covetGeo Teasdale

Eight were appointed to theBritish Isles and were located in the following Conferen-ces Samuel W. Western and John E. Huish, to the Bir-mingham; George Marshall and Robert H. Hodgeto the Manchester; John H. Clark and Edwin JohnLonghurst, to the London; Charles England to theNorwich Conferences and John T. Evans toWales. Bro. John B. Milner and his wife on avisit to relatives and business. They were all ingood health and spirits. We held a council meet-ing in the morning with the missionaries and theywere appointed to their fields of labor. They metwith us at our evening meeting in Bittern St,and bore their testimonies and expressed their wil-lingness to do their best to fill a good mission.(Prest Jos. Leaing, of the London Conference, who waswith us at our morning council, gave the brethrensome most excellent counsel on missionary labors. 
 Bro. Joseph Leaing has expressed himself as everyLatter-day Saint, or servant of God feels. Hewishes to be where the Lord wants him. In yourcommunication to me, of July 23rd, you say—"We thinkit quite proper for you to release Br. Jos Leaing sothat he may return home if he so desires—" Now hehas never expressed that desire. He is one of theLords Own, a minute man, a bright live miss-ionary and waits patiently to be released whenhe shall receive that word. He has been herethree years next month, having arrived here onOctober 13, 1886 and is willing to stay as long ashe is required. He enjoys the fellowship of theHoly Ghost, and consequently knows that thework we are engaged in is of God, and guidedby the Spirit of revelation, according to theorder of the Priesthood that He had appointedto the responsibility of presidency and thedirecting of the labors of their fellowservantsunder His direction, or revealed will, andso he says "when the Lord manifests His willfor me to return I shall be pleased to do so,but until then I am perfectly willing to la-bor wherever I may be appointed." As I un-derstand it, my beloved president, this is thetrue feeling of every disciple of Jesus Christ.It is, "Father not my will but thine be done."It is the glory of God to have such humblefaithful soul who love to serve Him and 
 keep His commandments, because they wantto. Now I would be pleased to have your mindon this question—Shall Bro. Leaing stay until theSpring or go him this fall? I ask this questionto satisfy my own mind as much as any-thing else. I will write more freely next timeafter I have received your answer. I havereceived a letter from Bro. Job Pingree inwhich he says he has had an interviewwith yourself & counsel and some membersof the Twelve "in my behalf" I am at a loss toremember whatever I could have said to himto call forth such an expression. Bro Pingreespent a few days with us and we muchenjoyed his excellent spirit. We talked to-gether very freely about the mission andthe spirit of the gentiles. He had quitean experience visiting his friends andacquaintances. He was with me in the prayerroom and I read him some letters fromthe elders, all testifying to the spirit ofindifference in some places and mobocra-tic feeling in others so that he got quite aninsight into the condition of the missionand I remember telling him that if he sawany of the authorities at home he would bewell posted to give them a pretty good report 
 much better then I could do through the me-dium of a sheet of paper; and when he left allI remember saying was give my kind love tothe Presidency, or any of the Twelve you may seeand tell them we are patiently rowing againstthe stream. We have been sounding the gospeltrumpet by preaching and destributing tractsand consequently have stirred up the people,unprincipled men finding Jarman are makinga good living by traduscing the "mormons" haveadopted a similiar mode of obtaining aliving and selling Jarmans books of courseall this inflames the people against us. Youknow how ready they are to believe anythingagainst us. But we are busy doing all wecan to seek out the House of Israel andtrying by the grace of God to do our dutyand tell the people what the Book of Mormonis and supply them at a cheap rate.  Inall our heavenly Father has blessed us and en-couraged as in our labors and duties.  It isHis work and we are only poor representa-tives of His cause, but we love to serve Him andlabor in our poor way looking to Him for theincrease, and grace ourselves to over come andendure unto the end in His Church & Kingdom.So far as we are concerned we are not discouraged.If the people do not want the gospel it is their 
 loss not ours. If they prefer the testimony ofan escaped lunatic going through theland with a lying spirit traducing Godspeople, why we cannot help it. Our Eldershave been testifying to the restoration ofthe gospel and the authority of God,with the priesthood, to administer in theordinances of His House, and offering themthe Pearl of Great Price—Eternal Lives—andthey despise them and their testimony, soit is not to be wondered at, they shouldcrowd together to listen to and believea lie, that they may be damned whohave pleasure in unrightiousness and be-lieve not the truth. I do not know thatwe should condemn these people so muchwhen we see the course being pursued inthe gathering place of the saints amongstthose who have been converted and blessedof the Lord, and their children who havebeen raised in the midst of light andtruth. From all we hear through the pressand from private sources, if there arenot those in Zion ripening for the burn-ing as well as those on the outside world,why then we will gladly confess ourselves 
 mistaken. President Woodruff, the elders inIsrael, at home or abroad, who are servingGod and keeping His commandmentsare not discouraged. They understandthe signs of the times and know that butfew men will be left. The propecies do notpoint to the Church of the Lamb being so verynumerous; they know it is a strait and narrowway that leads to life everlasting, and aremore interested in making their owncalling and election sure then gettingdiscouraged because of the folly or in-difference of others. Do not think we arediscouraged or weary of serving God, forit is not so. We simply trust in God andseek His counsels day and night. Wewant His will to be done, we want HisKingdom, not only for ourselves, but for thebenefit of our posterity—of unborn generations.We want the government of God and the ruleof His Priesthood—of righteousness—for we haveall faith that where the meek and pure inheart rule we will have a reign of righteous-ness. With kindest love and blessing to your-self, counsellors, and brethren of the Apostles,I remain as ever Your unworthy brother in ChristGeorge TeasdaleP.S.

 North Lat. 44, Long 69, 10. North Fox Islands, Vinalhaven, Maine, Sept. 15, 1837Aphek & Azubah Woodruff,Honoured ParentsAs dutyAnd the commandments of God hath called your Son to stand uponthe Islands of the sea in defence of the word of God, & the testi-mony of Jesus Christ, I am under the necessity of makinguse of my pen to communicate all information that yourecieve from me, but this is a privilege inasmuch as we cannot do it by word of mouth. I would inform you that Irecieved a letter from my wife yesterday informing me that shetook two letters out of the Office for me, one from you, & the other from Brother Asahel. She gave me the purport of them. I was glad to hear from you, & all the friends & esspecially that the word hadthe desired affect in Aunt Cossetts family, & with others. I would like tobe with you & our friends in Connecticut long enough to build up aChurch, but if I cannot be, I pray God to send some faithful servent amongyou to teach the word. I expect you wish to hear where I am, & what I amdoing &c. On the 19th of Aug, in company with Elder Hale, I left Portland onboard the steamboat Bangor, foxr fox Islands, Vinalhaven. After travling 100miles on the steam boat; we took a vessel & was landed on North fox Island at 2 oclok Sunday morning following, entire strangers & about peneyless. We called at the firsthouse & retired to rest, as we had slept none through the day & night. We arose at 8oclock took breakfast. I then enquire if their was any priest or religion on the Island.they informed us theirre was a Baptist meeting house & church & priest in thecentre of the Island, & that there would be preaching to day. In the name of theLord we hastened to the place. Meeting had commenced. I sent for the deaconto come to the door; I told him we were servents of God, we had a message tothe people & wished to be herd. he informed the priest of it. he invited us intothe pulpet. After he closed they had a short intermission I then arose & addressedthe congregation, and it was amid many peculiar feelings; knowing that it was the firsttime the voice of an Elder ^of^ the Latter Day Saints, was herd upon one of the Islands of the sea,to set forth the fullness of the gospel. When I closed I gave out several appointments forpreaching in different parts of the Island, which was 9 miles long & 2 miles wide containing 800inhabitants divided into four distrects having four school houses. We presented Mr Newton (thisBaptist priest) the Book of Mormon he was mild, did not object to it, said he would read it. In thefirst fourteen days, we preached nineteen discourses, & the whole Island flocked out to hear.The priest began to see his foundation giving way, he was alarmed & began to cry against us& would not let us have the meeting house. But the excitement ^was^ so great & the people so muchin our favor that on Sunday the 27th the people asseb assembled at a school house to hear us 
 While Mr. Newton had the meeting house to himself without one solitary soul to accompany him.Even the deacons of the church were attending our meetings & enquiring into these things && calling upon us to visit them, & the sound went abroad to other Islands of thesea with rapidity, & they came over in their ships & boats to hear for themselves. OnSunday the 3rd Sept. I preached to a Large congregation assembled together from differentIslands after I closed a very wealthy, respectable Sea Captain & his Lady cameforeward & wished to be baptised. We repaired to the waters of the Atlantic & Elder Halelead them down into the sea & baptized them. These are the first baptized upon the Islandsof the sea (to my knowledge) by the Elders of Israel, & they are the first fruits of our min-istry here. & On last Sunday the 10 th of the month, I met a large congregation at the sameplace from different Islesands, & & preached to them from Math 16 ch 17, 18, & when I closedanother sea captain a member of the Baptist church came forward for baptism & also a young Lady. We repaired to the sea shore, & while the people throng'd the beach I leadthem forth into the ocean & baptized them both for the remission of their sins & ladehands upon them & they received the Holy ghost & were made glad. On the Tuesdayfollowing three others wished to be baptized & the ordinance was administered unto themby Elder Hale which makes seven we have baptized. Thus you seae the Lord hath notsent us here in vain. There is many on our right & left ready as it were to step intothe waters of Baptism. Calls begin to salute us from the different Islands come &preach to us, come & preach to us. We have visited South Fox Island & held five meet-ings with them, they came out by hundreds & filled the homes. South Fox Island is 10 miles long & 5 wide containing 1000 inhabitants with 6 school houses no meeting house but a methodistchurch, & a priest in their midst. They have 3 saw mills & one grist mill these are all tidemills vinal haven fits out rising of 100 vessels for fishing & mostly from this Island.The inhabitants of Vinalhaven are wealthy, healthy, industrious, intelligent, generous & very hospitableto strangers notwithstanding they are mostly fishermen. pop 1,800. Vinalhaven includes both of fox Islands. NorthIsland is rather rocky & rough have some fine farms, rase good wheat, barley, & potatoes, which is the staple pro-ductions, but little stock excepting sheep which are numerous. they have but just finished haying and are nowin the midst of wheat harvest. There is an aboundance of raspburies and gooseburies on these Islands, but arenow mostly gone. not much of any other fruit. The timber is spruice, fir, & hemlock. Their is one Post Office &store on this Island. one tide grist mill, &c.South Fox Island is as near without any form or void I think asany think I ever saw. It is almost impossible for the best historian to give an exact description of it. it is a universalmass of ledges & shelves of rocks formed into hills & valleys cut up into necks & points to make room for thecoves and harbours that run through & through this Island. One may form some faint idea of it, on learning that it issupposed to be rising of 100 miles round the Island to follow the beach in all its crooks & angles. There is some small partsof this Island under cultivation but it is at the expens of great labour & toil. The hills are timbered with pitch pine and spruce, the timber & bushes principly grow out of the cracks of the rocks, while the valleys are timbered in the samemanner with fir & birch. this people procured their wealth & living wholey by fishing, perhaps their is no people that supplygreater quantities of fish than they of this Island. many of them fish at Newfoundland & prepare them for sale here. their ismany kinds of fish here around these Island such as Whale, Blackfish, shark, ground shark, Pilot fish, Hors mackerel,stergeon, Holloboat, Salmon, Cod, Pollock, Hake, Haddock, Shad, Mackerel Tom cod, Bass, Alewives Herren, Pohagen, DolphinFrost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Scate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Muttonfish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers,Munkfish, Nurs fish, Sunfish, Sword fish, Tharsher, catfish, whiting, scuppog, Tootog, Eyefish, Minney's, cunner, Ling, Eels, Lobsters, clames, scollops, Mussels, Wrinkles, seal, & Porposes &c &c. & many others not named. I have stood on theshore & seen large schools of Mackerel come up to us so that we could catch any quantity of them with hooks that wewished, also the beach is supplyed with clames in almost any part of the Island. The adjoining Islands are more fertilethan these. In a clear day I can view with the naked eye about fifty Island of the sea many of which are inhabited, & sometimes20 or 30 gallant ships are passing by us at once &c. I have not givien this brief history of these Islands because my mind is more 
 on these things than my calling, for it is not. consequently I wish to call your minds back again to my labour in the vineyardI remarked that many came out to hear us on the South Island. The methodist priestbecame alarmed for fear his foundation also was in danger, & he came over whare we were baptizing& made friends with the Baptist priest, (like Herod & Pilate) and called a meeting I went outto hear him. [##Luke 23:12##] He commenced warm hostilities against the Book of Mormon and our principlesI wrote down his discours & are to give answer to it next Sunday, at which time I expectto meet a numerous assembly I learned he would not be present to hear my answer so Iarose & rectifyed some of his wild mistakes in his presensce before he left the congregation.The Baptist priest has written Letters & even gone himself to the main land after several prieststo come over and help them, declairing if they do not come the churches here will surelyfall. -[But cursed is man that puteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm saith the Lord]- But O yepriests of Baal your cry is in vaine. The God of Israel hath set his hand to recover Israel his peopleThe stone has begun to roll. God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the wise, andwith them he will rend your Kingdoms. The cry of the Saints is assending unto the Ears of the Lordof Sabaoth for Ephraim. The Apostles of the Lamb of God are bearing the Keys of his Kingdomon the shores of Europe. Yea & the mighty captains of these Islands are receeving the gospel ofJESUS CHRIST & injoying its power. And the call of many from distant Islands hasalready entered into our Ears to come & preach to them. My own Book of Mormonhas this day taken its departure over the billows of the great deep to teach those that trade inships at sea, & the word & work is propelled by the arm of JEHOVAH. And every weaponformed against Zion shall soon be broken, & he that raises his puny arm against it, is fightingagainst God, & shall soon mourn because of his loss. I say these things are so as God [himself]& the Spirit beareth record & the record is here. Therefore O Babylon thy fall is sure.My dear parents suffer me to drop a few words of mymeditations on this paper. When I think where I am, what my calling is, & where I have been & whare I shall be, & have to do in this generation, I marvel & wonder. I [page torn]myself. A few years since, I was tendindg mill as other men not expecting to do [page torn]to live & di[e] with my friends. But how changed the scene, the last four years has [page torn]the plow, called me into the ministry, bestowed the Holy priesthood, annointing, [page torn]Blessing upon my head, & called me into the ranks of [page torn] [s]eventy Apostles to pus [page torn]from the ends of the earth, and act a conspicuous part in winding up the august scene of these lastdays in rending the kingdoms of darkness, and error with everlasting truth. It has called me tovisit 16 different states in America, & travel about 14,000 miles to preach the word of God, andare now standing upon the Islands of the Sea, & thousands seeking wisdom & instructionat my mouth, While at the same time its wise & learned complain Bitterly that I amsapping the foundations of their Holy religion, churches & kingdom, & the ships of the seaspread their canvas to bring captains & sailors to hear my voice. I say amid thesetruths I ask myself the question who am I. ^I^ am that poor, weak, ignorant, IlliterateWillford. then I have nothing to boast. No God forbid. It is not Willford that has done this,but it is the power & work of God. I'll acknowledge he hath chosen the weak thingsof this world to perform his work with, & if I glory it shall be in the cross of ChristI cannot tell when I shall see any of you again. their was some invisidble power seemed tohurry me from connecticut to come on my journey, it has been so with me ever since I left Kirtland, untill I reached theseIslands, and the reason was because of the great work to be done here, for the sound will go from here to a vast number of theIslands to prepare the way before us. But I rejoice that I had the privilege of visiting you at all. I now feel as though it will be my privilegeto visit you again & build up a church in connecticut. But if I do not I pray GOD to send some one among you that will. I have greatfaith yet to believe that many of my blood relations & other friends will stand in the covenant before they die. yes I believe my Parents & their family will, for I know they are of the Blood of Ephraim, and the Lord will never suffer the good my father hath done to the poor in his ^day^ go unrewarded. I believe you will both live to see a change in this world which is fast hastning. it would be great joy to mysoul to see you stand in the covenant. It is the work of God that hath called me to do as I have done, and it marvelous in mine eyes. I rather expectto spend next summer amid these Islands of the sea. I intend to visit Deer Island as soon as possible, it is but 12 miles to it. it contains 4000inhabitants, and theirre is but one priest among them. I do not know whare I shall spend the winter, whether here or in Scarborough. My friendsmay still direct letters to Scarborough. Give my respects to Eunice, To Uncle Ozem & family & Aunt Cossetts family I think of writing to them both & also^to^ Brother Asahel, & finally remember me to all inquiring fr^i^ends. O how I wish they would all receive the fullness of the gospel. DearParents Pray for me & watch the signs of the times. I want to see you all much but I'll be content whare God would have me. ElderHale, & Phebe both wish to be remembered to you and all inquiring friends. That the peace of GOD may abide with you & thatyour lives health & strength may be prescious in HIS sight, is the prayer of your Dutiful son Willford Woodruff

 Rochester Sangamon County Illinois Dec 19th 1838[FIGURE] Eunice WoodruffMy Dear SisterAlthough I am in the midst of acroud & but a few moments allotted me to write yet I feel it my Duty to appropriatethese few moments in communicating a few words to you & my Dear parents.I thought it proper to direct this sheet to you in consequence of the writingon the 3rd page which is the production of Brother Asahels pen which I foundamong his papers which appears to be an address to you. Whether it is a copy ofwritings already in your possession or not I am unable to say. But as I feel anxiousto put in your possession all writings that you have sent him or that he hasdirected to you is the cause of my writing upon the same sheet. As Death hasclosed all communications between Asahel & yourself & our parents I feelit my duty to give you all information that I possess concerning his sickness& Death or any thing concerning him that will be of interest to you. I alsofeel it my Duty to write to you as often as my circumstances will admit& I have matter of interest to comunicate. I have much uponmy mind at this time I would like to communicate which I mus[t]omit for want of time but I will touch upon some importent itemsFirstly I hold in my hands a letter Dated Farmington Oct 31st 1838 fromAphek & Azubah & Eunice Woodruff to Mr James Dayson. in fine I havein my possession (I suppose) all the writings that were Directed to Asahel as well ashis own compositions I took them because I supposed that I should be ableto put them into the possession of my parents & Sister sooner than they could obtain them any other way & I much doubt whether you would ever obtained them had I left them in Terre Haute I shall give youinformation upon this subject from time to time as I write. I have not hadtime as yet to look over his writings but little & do not know what there isamong them, but all of his corresponding letters with his Dear Sister & parents & Azmon & myself & many other friends are among them there is many compo-sitions of his own of interest among them I was particular to enquire of hisclerk & also Mr Smith concering his mind, his sickness, & death & I learnthe following particulars that he was considered one of the first & most respect-able citizens of Terre Haute & his death much regretted[upside-down text]Wilford Woodruff toEunice Woodruffgiving the Acco[un]t of the deathof Ashael Woodruff[end of upside-down text] 
 his clerk said to never find a more [page torn] task than to part with him he saidhe never saw a [page torn] mind than his he also remarked that he was very absent mindedfor several months before his Death cheerful most of the time but occasionly lostin Deep meditation he spent muc^c^h of the time During his last months among his friendsin public at ^times^ almost to the neglect of his business this was a secret they could not account for (ButI could have told them that it was his mind upon spiritual subjects he was convinced of light & truth had none tounbosom his feelings unto & mingled with company to pass away his time & c.)

I wrote Asahel a Letter which he received just before his Death inwhich my mind was much exercised I never felt like bearing stronger testimony to anyperson than in that letter I little thought that it was my last testimony to him Iwrite a letter to him afterwards but it did not arive untill after his death There wasthree Doctors attended upon Asahel During his sickness (which was 3 to many) I visited myBrothers grave I felt solumn while viewing it poor man he had not a relative to attendon his bed side or follow him to his grave I picked up some small stones from hisgrave in memory of him I was sorrow that in the sale of his papers that some articlesof his clothing was not reserved but every thing of that nature was sold I have all of his[former] account Books his journals compositions, his watch two silver thimbles& pencils & penknife & c. you can make any enquiries of me by letter concerningthose things that you wish as soon as I can inform you where to direct a letter Iam sensible that Asahels Death will be deeply felt by you all he was a belovedSon & Brother truly may the Lord comfort you all under this affliction. My DearSister since Asahel is gone It has given me great consolation to meditate uponthe cause. you have persued continue faithful in the cause in which you areengaged & you will receive a crown of Life! O that I can but meet my Sisterin the celestial glory the thought of it will sweeten my tri[a]ls on Earth. Do notthink that your Brother is Discouraged because of persecutions in the west. No God forbidit is true a number of our worthy brethren have sealed their testimony with their Bloodof late, it is equally true that if it is the will of God your Brother is ready & willing to share thesame fate. I tremble not at the approach of Death it has no terror to me I may be called tofeel a Missourian's steel or lead for my religion if so & my work is Done I say amen, I amready to meet it you may hear of my Death, but by the grace of God assisting me youshall not be pained with the intelligence that I have drawn back unto perdition I amtravling through the cold of winter with a wife & child which is severe at this time but Iendure these things patiently many of our Brethren are stoped at the Mississippi River beca[u]seof there faith I may be stoped myself but I shall travel untill I am give me yourprayers Dear parents & Sister while Asahel sleeps in Death let me be consecrated tolive or Die for Christ.

 Salt Lake City,April 21, 1880.Ammon M. TenneyDear Brother:I have tried to get time to write to you ever since I have reached SaltLake City, but have never been in a situation to give you any information forthe want of time and getting certain business done before the Council. Bro.Taylor got a letter from J. W. Y. -[John W. Young]- saying that you had moremissionaries than was necessary at the Meadows to hold the claims so you wasgoing to put some of them into the Missionary field. I was glad to learn this.If you have men to spare, the sooner the better. Bro. Young telegraphed thatyou, Christofferson and himself were at Albuquerque to buy goods for a Co-opStore, and he spoke about taking contracts on the Railroad for our people. Ifthe brethren could unite together and take a contract so as to pay, I think itwould be a good thing, so as to get their bread.Now, concerning St. Johns. How is that a going? Bro. Hatch wrote me thatsomebody was sent as an Agent to borrow 100 cows to make the first payment ofBro. Flake. I was in hopes that the people who went there would be able to raisethat first hundred cows. I wish you would write to me an[d] let me know how mattersare at St. Johns, and what arrangements you have made for entering the land. Ihave got the privilege from Bro. Taylor and Council to use all tithing stockin the Territory to help pay for St. Johns, unless the brethren can occupy theland and pay for it.This may be used as a loan and repaid when the people pay; I shall writeto Lot and Jesse N. Smith and Richards of St. Joseph to unite with the tithingstock what they can, for we do not want that purchase to fail and I want you to call upon Christofferson of Round Valley, Bp. Hunt and Jesse N. Smith of Snow-flake, Bp. Richards of St. Joseph and Lot Smith of Sunset, and Bp. Lake ofBrigham City to gather the tithing stock, and you use it for the payment onthat purchase as a loan, keeping a strict account of what tithing stock youuse for the purpose. I shall write to them about it.I wish you would write to me as soon as you get this, and tell me how things are with you, and what you have paid on St. Johns, and what the prospectis. Tell me where the railroad is going and what the prospect is for our brethren to take jobs on it, and what rate. Direct from W. Woodruff, Salt LakeCity, Utah Box 321. I feel anxious to hear from you, and want to know whatmissionaries you have in the field and where, and any news I will be glad to get.My kind regards to Sister Tenney and all the brethren with you.Your brother in the Gospel,W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake CityMay 25, 1880Mr. A. M. Tenney,Dear Brother;I received your two letters May 7 and 8, and ^they^ have been read to Bro.Taylor, and we are all pleased that things are as well as they are with you.A few items I wish to speak of. We sent word to the Priests and Bishops to assistin paying for the purchase of St. John in case of necessity, but as they can haveno demand upon you until next November perhaps by that time there may be helpenough to pay for the place without borrowing the Church stock, at least it mightbe well to let it rest until fall to see what position you will be in.Concerning taking contracts on the railroad I think that would be well, butI think the Presidents of the Stakes should be consulted and a Committee appointedand some man chosen to make these contracts for the people who will do justice bythe people and not pocket one half the people's earnings by their lax^b^or. Ofcourse any man who takes these contracts on the railroad should be well paid forhis labors. But there is so much speculation in taking railroad contracts thatit wants to be well guarded. This work should be done through the Board of Tradeor a Committee appointed by the people. But one thing should be guarded against,the Mormons should not underbid each other but get as much as they can for thework. Our people should grade all the railroad that goes through our settlementsand if they act wisely they can get a good price for it. I think it would be wellto consult with Jesse N. Smith and Lot Smith on the subject, as the work willhave to be done by those stakes.You will want to unite together upon that work, and all act honestly witheach other, and let each have what he earns. I think the grading of that rail-road will give profitable business to many of our people.Again Bro. Watkins gave me an account of some political or Elections matterswith you concerning sending the next Delegate to Congress. I want to say concern-ing this matter. It is one of the most delicate things between this church andthe Gentiles. There should be no step taken by any of the Saints upon this subject 
 or pledges offered by any of the people without strictly consulting with Lot Smith, Jesse N. Smith, the Bishops and leading Mormons of Arizona.And the next Election we should have all the County Offices of Apache Co.Our people have legal votes enough to carry it. My feelings would be to elect asa Delegate to Congress one who would be the best man, (if there is any best) andthe one that would do us the most good; but the Mormons must all unite upon thismatter, there should be no divisions with any of the brethren upon this point.With regard to your entry of the land of St. John, I have conversed withPrest. Taylor and he thinks I should consult a lawyer upon this subject, and Iwill send you instructions what to do Therefore take no further action until youhear from me upon the subject. Perhaps we can enter a townsite under the ArizonaLaws, if not we will have to pre-empt. I do not want to trust to homestead, itwill take too long But we have got to have honest men, if we can find them, toenter the land. But I will send you word as soon as I can get it.There is another subject I was somewhat surprised at, that is the price ofthe claim of the upper ditch, for I understood when you made the purchase thatyou had all the water and land except a small upper ditch that Barths chargedcows for, and when there was a failure in the purchase the 50 cows was knockedoff. Now they want $7,500 for the purchase, which amounts to a bout two thirds asmuch as all the first purchase—that is something I do not understand.Still, we as a people ought to own all of the land and water we can get, aswe want as little mixture with the outside as we can help. I shall do what I canto send men and means. But many who were opposed to going make but slow headway.I have spoken to the brethren about appointing David Udell -[David K. Udall]- forBishop of St. John and have had no opposition to it yet.I realize that you want more Missionaries to go among the Lamanites and Iwill do what I can to help send men. I am glad you have good prospects for a crop,and that you have a chance to turn in barley. I think it is a fair price.How do the brethren do about holding the claims on the meadow?

 LeSueurSalt Lake City—May 26, 1881Elder A. M. Tenney,Dear Brother: Your letter of March 11, 1881, is before me and I write to answerit. I was glad to hear that all things were as favorable as theyare in the payment of the St. John purchase. We have called something like ahundred men to go to St. John this season. How many will reach there I do notknow. I hope it will be occupied by the Saints, so that the Gentiles will not wishto be there. I saw from a letter from Bishop Udall, that arrangements were madeto enter a good deal of the land in the purchase. This I was pleased to see forI have considered this very important.Now BrotheSr Tenney, concerning your remarks upon the railroad contracts, Iwish to say that the Presidency of the Church were not anxious for our peopleto engage in the railroad business at all, but as so many were anxious to engagein it, the Presidency and the Twelve both felt that it was important that someof the Quorum should be appointed to go to Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado andpreside over the organization of our people in these territories who were engagedin the building of these railroads, and Erastus Snow, B. Young, J. W. Young andJesse N. Smith were appointed a committee to go to these territories and organizethe camp, and to direct and control all contracts made upon that railroad and seethat all camps of the Saints attend to their prayers and observe the Sabbath andto see that all labor get their pay. They received strict written instructionswhat to do, and E. Snow and B. Young went to Arizona for that purpose, but nobodycomplied with the instructions, and the consequence is that John W. Young wascalled to Salt Lake City and the Twelve and the Presidency have sat for days ininvestigating this subject, and the final decision is that John W. Young and allthe others must abide by their instructions and take counsel in the matter ifthey maintain their standing in the Church of Jesus Christ of LatteSr-day Saints.John W. Young has agreed to do this, to throw all of his contracts intotheir hands and to carry it on under their united counsel. And I would advise youand every other elder in the church, who are taking contracts upon that railroad,who are employing the Saints to work under them, to do as John W. Young has done,to take their counsel in these matters. If you are not satisfied with yoursettlement with J. W. Young, I would advise you to have E. Snow and B. Young tosettle it between you.Another subject I wish to speak upon and that is the Lamanite Mission.I had a great deal of confidence in you in this matter, as you had the Spanishand were qualified to labor there, and I was in hopes that you would be able tocarry that mission. But it seems that you are engaged in the railroad businessand I do not know whether you will ever by at liberty to do anything upon thatmission. You wished me to appoint somebody else to preside and you would workwith them, but I thought you the best qualified to preside over it of any onethere. But as you have resigned, I told Brother Snow to accept of your resignation,if you could not attend to it, and appoint some one in your place so that the mis-sion may not be given up, for I do consider the salvation of that people of moreimportance than building railroads or getting rich.I am always glad to hear from you. Remember me kindly to your family and toBrother Udall, if you see him.Your brother in the Gospel.W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City May 27, 1880Ammon M. TenneySt. Johns, Apache Co., ArizonaDear Bro.I have consulted with lawyers and friends about entering the St. Johns purchase and after getting all the information we can, we have come to the conclusion that the safest, best and cheapest way is to enter the land by quarter sections. It is very difficult to enter a townsite and we have to pay a good deal more to the Government and it takes all together too long to home-stead.If you have not used your entry right, I would like you to enter the Quarter which is of the most value and then put trusty men to enter the rest. Those who enter will have to claim a house or shanty of some kind, until they pay for it, and get a Government title before they can deed to others. You will want to find out the sections, stakes, half sections and quarter sections, so as not to make any mistakes about the land you enter. All persons will have to go to Prescott to enter the land.You will want to learn the Township, Range Plot Section, so as not to make a mistake in the entry.I enclose a letter to J. W. Young, which I will not seal for I have an order in it for several persons who paid tithing to J. W. Young, and they may be with you, some of them. I want you to see that they have credit on the tith-ing books, of whatever ward they may be in, as I do not know where John W. is, I trust to you to send the letter to him.I wish now to say that we decided in Council last night to send David Udell -[ David K. Udall ]- to preside as Bishop at St. Johns., L. John Nuttall will notify him. I have tried ever since I came, to get him appointed as Bishop of that place, but I did not get it accomplished until last night.I shall be glad to hear from you from time to time to know how you progress. My love to your family and all the Saints with you and please excuse a short letter now.Your brother in the GospelW. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City, May 31, 1880Mr. A. M. Tenney,Dear Brother:I have just received your two letters and read them to Brother Taylor, and our counsel is for you today, to those brethren who are at St. John, who are taking land, that our counsel to them is to turn out in payment for the land, oxen, horses, wagons, harness, or anything they have to help pay for it, and not wait for the last day of payment.I have written to you concerning the election. We want you to consult with the presidents of stakes and their counsellors, the bishops and counsellors, and all the people must unite together and agree whom they will vote for as delegate to Congress, and then all write and vote for your county officers. The Mormons have a great majority of votes in Apache County, and it is a duty they owe to themselves to put their own men into office. You write to Lot and to Jesse N. Smith and consult with them about it. The people must be united and not divide in these matters.I have already notified you that we have appointed David Wall, -[ David K. Udall ]- as bishop of St. John and he has been notified of it. How soon he can go I know not. You should reserve a good city lot and farming land for him. You can ask him when he can come.I am surprised that you have received so little pay on the purchase for the number of men. All should understand that they cannot hold that land if they do not pay for it, for it was bought for the Saints, but we expect them to pay for it.If you are likey to have trouble with the Apaches, you should all form yourselves into a military company without delay and see that your arm and ammunition are in good order and ready at hand.I thought all matters were settled between Brothers Hunt and Hatch. They agree(d) to settle and bury everything (the) night of the settlement.I am now notifying some men at Box Elder City to prepare to go to St. John. We will send men as fast as we can.You need not call for any tithing stock to pay on the St. John purchase, unless you are obliged to. I was sorry to hear that Brother Johnson had made such a poor -[choice]- out of his settling. I told him to go to St. John. Men who take counsel will be blessed. Those who do not will suffer.I have only time to write a little this evening. My love to all.Your brother in the Gospel, W. Wroodruff per J. J. 
 Sunset, Apache Co. Arizona Feb. 19th 1880To the Latter-day Saints in St. John District:Bleoved Brethren:We have met in council at Sunset, and taken into consideration the situationof the town and land purchased by A. M. Tenney, and we have put a ^the^ price of the farming land $8.00 per acre: and the City Lots at $25.00 on an average; and wehave named our town "St. John," for it is at St. John. And we wish it distinctlyunderstood, by the Saints who settle there that we do not expect to enter intoany speculation in the purchase of this country, for ourselves or our Brethren.Our labors in these matters are for the building-up of Zion, and the settlingof the Saints. We have figured this matter as closely as we can, and we feel thatwe cannot put the land and lots at any lower price. When the land and lots are soldand the debts paid, if there is anything left, it will be returned, pro. rata, tothose who have paid for the land: and if we fall short of the payment, we considerit right and just that those who have purchased the land, shall also pay, pro. rata.to help pay the debt: but we expect the price set, will pay for the land. Bro.Ammon M. Tenney was appointed to make this purchase, and we look to him to deal outthis land, both city lots and farming land, to those who buy: the payments to bemade to him. He is held responsible for the fulfilment of the contracts. We wouldlike all of the Brethren that he calls upon to assist him in any matter appertainingto the settling of the place. We wish further to be understood that Brother Tenneyhas been appointed to preside over the settlement of St. John, and to preside overall meetings when he is present, until he is released from his responsibilities.We also appointed Brother Tenney to preside over the Lamanite Mission; the thereason that he has already opened the doors among many of the Eastern Villages,and is quite well versed in Spanish.We have also appointed Brother J. Allred to assist Bro. Tenney, under hisdirection, and to preside over the meetings in Bro. Tenney's absence, until theyare more fully organized. And we wish all the Brethren who take land, to do whatthey can, at once, to assist in the payment of the same. We have advised Bro.Tenney in relation to the Missionaries associated with him, as regards theirraising grain for the season, concerning which he will instruct you.W. Woodruff—John W. Young

WoodruffSalt Lake City.Dear Brother:I sent a copy of the Liverpool Daily Post to Prest Snow,F. D Richards & Bro Jno. containing a report of the mobbing of some "Mormon" Elders, through the report of a woman that the Elders had decoyed away her daugh-ter who had returned, with two children and had to walk from Liverpool to London &c. Well from advices received from London we learn that the Elders did not preach in that place, but they held an open air meeting in Mile End Road and had a splendid good meeting and was listened to with a good deal of attention. I suppose this is the way the adversary is educating his children to mob the Saints. In my inquiries about copyright and the regis-tering at Stationers Hall I have come ac-cross the following—"A copyright extends to 42 years." Elder C. W. Symons and D. H. Snarr, who are laboring in London, went to Stationers Hall and obtained the 
 following information—"The Doctrine and Covenants was registered at Stationers Hall, June 7, 1845, by Wilford Woodruff of Stanley Buildings, Bath St Liverpool.These brethren are searching to find out the copyrighting of all our Church works.They could find nothing of the Book of Mormon. The officials at Stationers Hall said if it was first published in America, it could not be registered there.They also assert that the Doctrine and Covenants was registered June 7, 1845 and published June 15, 1845 eight days after being registered and therefore gives it no protection. The charge for searching is one shilling a letter, it being arranged in letters. They searched through two letters from 1840 to 1873. They could not find The Book of Mormon or HymnBook. Prest Leaing is giving it his attention and I hope before long to get all the information we want. We are all well and rejoicing in the truth. With kindest regards.Your brother in the CovtGeo.

Hays and some of the Elders from Utah.We held a Priesthood Meeting oin the everning. There were fifteen Elders from Utah and several of the local Presidents of Branches and local priesthood.On Sunday we held three meetings. On Monday a meeting with the Utah elders in the morning and in the evening I preached at Hucknall Torkard. Yesterday after visiting at Hucknall I went to Mansfield and held a meeting Elders H. H. Shurtliff, H Y Tilley and myself doing the preaching. We had a most excellent time. This conference is in an excellent condition.On Saturday last Elders L. A. Cannon, E. L.Sloan and his sister left for Utah pr. Guion S.S. Nevada. When we received your cablegramwe notified these brethren and on the following day for the departure of a Guion Co. Steamship they left for home. Bro. E L Sloan seemed ra-ther disappointed to have to return before the completion of his mission, but Bro. Cannon having 
 been away from home over two years and a quarter was happy of the privilege of returning. The Lord has kindly encouraged some of the brethren by giving them some precious souls for their hire and seals for their ministry that has caused them to rejoice and take courage in their labors. I returned this afternoon full of thanksgiving to God for all His mercies received a most excellent letter from folks ^at^ Nephi and rejoiced in His matchless love and kindness. In Sundays Chronicle there is a piece call-ed "Dying Mormonism" which I enclose that you may see how the people are being educated (?)with regard to the Work of God. How ready the peo-ple are to believe false prophets. If the "recruits from Europe" where as benighted and ignorant as this "Travelling Correspondent", they may well be pitied.These wiseacres speak as they would wish it to be,but fortunately for the human family and the righteous in particular it is Babylon that is doomed and every plant that the Father has not planted and not His Church or the Gospel of the Kingdom. It is mail time and our ^Wednesday^ even-ing meeting so I must conclude. I am happy to report we are all well in health and spirits.With kindest love to yourself, counsellors, bretherenof our Quorum and those associated with you I remain as everYour brother in patienceGeorge Teasdale

PrestJ. U. Stucki came with the emi-grants from the Swiss & German Mission.  Hise iswell. Last Sunday I met with the Elders and Saints in the Welsh Mission in a Conference held at Merthyr and we had a very profitable time. The anti "mormons" tried to annoy and break up our meeting, but signally failed. There were 20 Elders from Utah and we had an exceedingly 
 pleasant time in our Priesthood meetings.  Tomor-row Sunday the 22nd we hold Conference at Norwich. In our searchings after the copy right-ing of our Church Works we do not seem very hap-py but we discover enough to be assured of the absurdity of the claim of the Pratt family. The key to Theology was copyrighted in March 1855 by Franklin D. Richards of 15 Wilton St Liverpool.the day of the month does not appear on the records.

Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:Your favor of the 23rd ult was received and read with much pleasure and I have deemed it wisdom to publish it in part for the encouragement of the Elders that they may redouble their efforts and work whilst the day lasts. Prest Fjeldsted writes us under date of Sep. 21stas follows—"It is with regret that I must inform you that we are meeting with quite an oppo-sition in the Aalborg Conference, as also oin Bornholm, from which places now several of the Elders have been banished so I have for athe time being compelled to withdraw the missionaries from Bornholm and send the one (bro E. Kofford), under banishment, to Norway where also a brother Nielsen from Aalborg Conf[eren]ce had to go a few weeks ago, and now Bro. C. K. Hansen, President of Aalborg Conf[eren]ce is also banished and Bro L. C. Johnson expects to get papers served on him in a few days,but I have changed him to another Con-ference so perhaps he can evade the officers and remain in Denmark. The police are also seeking after the other brethren now laboring 
 In the afternoon I explained why we partook of the Sacrament and what we considered essential before we could consistently do so. Elder John B. Milner & his wife attended Conference. Bro Milner spoke in the after-noon for about half an hour and bore an excellent testimony, was exceedingly interesting, and listened to with rapt attention. We had a fine successful conference seven Elders from Utah Prest Hy Tuckett, Abraham Maw, Rosel H. Hunter, Thos H. Blackburn, Wm J. Critchlow Jno B. Milner & myself. Bro's A. Maw & Hunter have been successful under the blessing of God of organizing a branch in Hull and bap-tizing twenty two souls. They have pretty much to sustain themselves in that Conference, Saints few and far between. When I returned to 42 I found your telegram relating to Bro D. M. McAllister and must say I am exceedingly sorry to part with him. I told him he had better leave with this Company on the 26th but he said he could not in justice as he would have to see to all the business connected with the Company but he would leave the following Saturdayand then he would be able to arrive in 
 in Aalborg Conf[eren]ce and if found will of course also be banished." Prest Fjeldsted also says—"Outside from these troubles we enjoy peace in the other parts of the mission and the brethren are meeting with encouraging success in various places." He also informs me he has sent a native elder to Preside in Alalborg. We have had some little encouragement also. Last Sun-day I attended an excellent Conference of the Norwich Conf[eren]ce. There was five to have been baptized but through some misunderstanding two men did not meet with the others, but three were baptized and confirmed. In the Scottish Mission also there have been some baptisms. Next Sunday I expect to attend a Conference of that Mission in Glasgow. We have the half yearly statistical reports of the Conferences of the British Mission and find (193) one hundred and ninety three baptisms (155) one hundred and fifty five emigrated (53)fifty three excommunicated and (23) twenty three died; a decrease of (66) sixty six to the mission (3230) Thirty two hundred and thirty, officers and members comprise the British Mission, good & bad. We have just published our Book of Mor-mon Ad broadcast, as much as to tell the people what the Book of Mormon is as to make business and so leave them without excuse. We have sold some we should not have done if we 
 the City about as soon as they would. When you send a cable gram to send anyone home immediately I should let them go without any regard to business. You know I am a minute man, but I cannot force anyone away. Bro Mac is a man of faith and trust in God, he is as calm as a summer's morning, and is turning over the business every day to the understand-ing of Bro L. R. Thomas, who has been as-sisting in the office during Emigration, and he is getting his things together to pack up and leave as cheerful and unconcerned as if it had been arranged for him to go and there had been no telegram. Bro. McAllister is a man of God one of natures noblemen, humble faithful and true. I have lived with him here two years and a third and can say that he improves upon acquaintance. We have in the office with us at present Bro S. T. Whitaker who leaves on Saturday for home and a brother George F. Phillips a youngman of excellent family — as the world goes —and good education. He is about 23 years of age. His parents are Catholics, mother is dead, 
 had not advertized but not enough to pay us in a financial point. We keep pushing our business to try and sell books. Our next venture is a cheap edition of the Hymn Book so all our children and young people as well as grown people, can have one for one shilling. Our cheap edition of the Book of Mormon for two shillings and our Voice of Warning for sixpence has been quite a success in spreading the know-ledge of the gospel and the scriptures. The blessing of the Lord has been with us. He put it into our hearts to publish these cheap editions and He has prosper-ed us in our labors. I hope for the sake of the work and of the people the elders will not be withdrawn from the nationsuntil He says it is enough. There is a pleasure in laboring for the Lord, in la-boring for Zion, if it is uphill business, or rowing against the stream, with all its discouragement it has its lights and shadows, its joys and sorrows. The exper-ience the elders gain is invaluable in fact it is priceless. It could not be gained under any other circumstances. Elder W. P. Payne was 
 His grand father on his mothers side was a Jew. He has always been religiously inclined and educated in the Catholic Church speaks French, Latin and is an organist, educated to be a physician. He was assistant organist at a Catholic Church. Of late he has been dissatisfied with the Catholic Church and had some interviews with a popular protestant evangelist, but was disgusted with the Come to Jesus declarations of this gentleman and concluded the Catholic Church was better than that. It happened that the Priest of the Church where bro Phillipswas assistant organist saw him walking with and in conversation with the Evan-gelist, and one evening after vespers when Bro P had been playing, the organist being absent, the priest came to him and asked him what he was talking to the evangelist for, and Bro Phillips told him he was in-quiring into his faith and principles. The Priest sharply reprimanded him and Bro P. defended himself and told the priest he was far from being satisfied with the Catho-lic Church. This added fuel to the fire, he was told that to doubt was to be damned &c and en-ded by cursing him and discharging him 
 unwilling to return he made a most excellent missionary. And as a general thing all the Elders say when spoken to about their releaseor released—"Just as you say Bro. Teasdale" we are in the hands of the Lord." This is the result of intelligence, they know this is the Work of the Lord that we are engaged in and that theirre is an order in His Curhurch and feel safe in sustaining that order. Your letter concerning the release of Bro. A Judd has been re-ceived. We have telegraphed him for the 5th of October Company if he can get ready. He will be missed in the Hol-land mission. Bro. Brown writes me he does not know what to do with the last three missionaries who have been appointed to Holland as they cannot speak the language and it takes a year before they can be of any service to the mission He is in want of elders who can go into the field and push the sale of the Book of Mormon and be an immediate help to him. Our good friend Mr Ramsden has just apprized us of the accident that happened to the Wisconsin Company that Bro. W. P. Payne had charge of. Is it 
 from the situation of assistant organist. He was occupying a position as assistant to a physician as he was training for the medical profession. One day he saw a scrap of a newspaper with a letter from a Mormon Elder writen on it. He had al-ways believed the Mormons were a wicked people. He was impressed to inquire about them and he wrote to the Glasgow Mail to make inquiry about the location of the "Mormons" in Glasgow where he could gain information concerning them and theydirected him to the "Millennial Star Office" and he wrote for information. We sent him some tracts and referred him to President S. T. Whittaker. A correspondence was open between them and Bro Whitaker let him have some tracts and he got quite interested One day he went out to visit a sick child leaving one of the tracts on the desk. During his absence the physician he was with saw the tract and read some of it and when Bro P. returned he censured him exceedingly for reading such stuff Bro P. defended himself and the princi-ples advocated in the tract and this led to the his dismissal from the physicians employ. Up to this time he had not been 
 not wonderful that no one was killed or crippled in such a terrible smash up? Sure-ly it is another evidence of the matchless love and power of God manifested in theprotection of His people. It is marvellous! Mr Ramsden has also caused the Post to insert another paragraph concerning that canard they published about "Mob-bing Mormon Missionaries" Mr Ramsden says in a letter to me—"I sent one of the copies of the "Star" to the Daily Post and asked them not to give you the trouble of inserting such articles for the future I think it will do them good and make them more care-ful in future."—Mr Ramsden is our true friend. I often think if we were all as faith-ful in our sphere as he is in his we would all do pretty well. And this man cannot see the truth as the Saints have the privilege but if he was a member of the Church he could not treat our people better than he does. I should like to know if the Post would have published that at our request? I doubt it very much for it has always been very bitter towards our people. I am happy to say we are all 
 baptized he was only investigating read-ing and attending meetings. When it was known he was investigating and likely to embrace the mormon faith it caused the greatest consternation. The priest was sent to reason with him his father persuaded him but he stood his ground got cursed by the priest and disowned by his father. He had asked for baptism but had been put off to be more enlightened, count the cost &c Bro Whitaker seeing what a cross he was taking up was slow to baptize him. However as there were some converted to the truth who disired Bro.Whitaker to baptize them before he left Bro Philips was baptized same time. A number of strangers were present at the baptism and confirnation. Through this step Bro Phillips father has turned his back upon him, would not speak to him not even to say good bye. They kept his clothes. He came here with Bro Whitaker to see me. He wrote me to say he was willing to do anything the Lord had for him to do. I saw him and 
 well in body and mind. We thank you very kindly for your faith and prayers and for the prayers of your counsellor's and the Twelve, for they are certainly answered. Jarman & Co are continuing their lectures because there is money in it, but they seem to have lost their influence. We are letting them severely alone and this seems the best way to do. The Lord is certainly able to do His own work, and from the very fact that He has allowed Jarman & Co. to travel and vilify His people for so many years is an evidence that it is for a purpose hereafter to be developed. With kindest love to the First Presidency, The Twelve and all associated with youand with continual prayers for your wel-fare and blessingI remain, as ever,Your brother in the gospelGeorge Teasdale 
 conversed with him at the Conference of the Scottish Mission, he was not in the Church then. I had intended to let him go into the field and labor to give him an experience but I find him so useful that he has been assisting us in the office this week. Your much valued favor of the 25th ult came safe to hand and read with much interest. I regret exceedingly that you lent Bro. Galbraith any money. He was going to work his way to Utah. He did work his passage across the sea. He appeared to me to have been brought into the Church for a wise purpose in the Lord and seemed to be an honest man. I should not have taken the liberty to introduce him to you if I had dreamed he would have taken an undue advantage of the introduction. He expressed himself as desiring to spend his life in the service of God and teach the young, preach the Gospel and labor anyhwere he might be of use. I only wanted you to see him and if you thought proper and there was a va-cancy in some of the coutown or country set-tlements where he gcould get an experience after he had got located that he might have the chance of it — But I am ashamed of having written so long a letter so will conclude withKindest love from all to all your brother in the Gospel Geo.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42, Islington, Liverpool,December 11th 1889.[sideways text]Geo. Teasdale11 Dec. 1889[end of sideways text]Dear President Woodruff,Your telegram, or rather cable gram, of the 5th inst, was received early in the morning of Thursday; before any one was up the boy from the Telegraph Office, was vigorously knocking at the door. We telegraphed early morning to Bro R.d Johnson and on Friday evening he was here; went on board ship and left Liverpool, pr Guion S. S.Arizona, on Saturday morning about 10 o'clock.I have written to Bro. J. M. Sjodhal to stay until the spring, and have released Prest. F. F. Hintze to re-turn home on account of his being unwell, and having been so long away from home. He will ar-rive in Utah about the last of this month, or the early part of next year. Bros. Stauffer and Simmons seem settling down to work. Bro. Locander writes me he has received blessings, enjoyments and satisfaction during the past year far above anything he anticipated and that he was content.As this will reach you about Christmas, I shall do myself the pleasure, of wishing you, your counsellors, and the Twelve, a happy peacefulChristmas, with your family and friends. May the blessings of the God of Israel attend you in all your administrations. Although I am absent in body, I am with you in spirit and in love, you all have my warm 
 affection, and fervent prayers, offered in the warmest brotherly love, and deep desire for your blessing and welfare; and that we may all have the great privilege of overcoming and enduring unto the end in the Church and Kingdom of God, and obtain an inheritance in the Kingdom of heaven.Presuming that you have seen our Brother D. M. McAllister, and that he has given you a better discription of the condition of this miss-ion than I can on a sheet of paper; I have said little at this time, reserving what I have to say until the end of the year. It is an anxious time with us now, to know how we are going to come out in our twelve monthswork. When we send our yearly statement I shall be pleased to give you further in-formation.May the blessings of our heavenly Father be continued unto you, and all the faithful of the House of Israel. With kind love to all, I remain,Your brother & fellow laborer,George TeasdaleP. S. All at 42 desire to join me in every expression of affection & confidence, and Compli-ments of the season. We send November State-ment to-day.  G. T.

S. Wyoming. There were 116 from Scandinavia, 24 from England, 6 from Holland, 3 visitors, 9 missionaries from Scandinavia, and 3 from England, making in all 161 Souls. They were under the presidency of Elders A. L. Skanchy Prest, Ola Olson 1st, and C. C. A. Christensen 2nd Counsellor and Secretary. F. Jacobsen, Olaus T Nielsen, Julius Johnson, Chas. K. Hansen, J. J. Nielsen, & Edmund Sanderson, (the last named returning through sickness) from Scan-dinavia and Samuel T. Whitaker, Samuel A Blair, and Thomas Beard of the British Mission. Bro. John B. Milner and wife and a Mrs. Brown were the returning visitors. On Thursday evening, the 24th inst, whilst we were holding a fellow-ship meeting in the prayer room at 42 with the returning missionaries and some of the Saints, a number of missionaries arrived per GuionS. S. Arizona. F. C. Mickleson, J. P. Olsen, John Johnson & Ole Olsen for Scandinavia Orson Merrill Edward Peay, Ezra C. Rich, Chas R. Lyman, W. B. Gibbons. 
 for the British B. Heertjes, for the Holland, and John Schweizer, for the Swiss & German Missions. Those for England are appointed as follows—E. C. Rich and Chas R. Lyman to Birmingham, Edward Peay to Leeds, W. B. Gibbons to Norwich and Orson Merrill to the Newcastle Conferences. There were also some visitors O. P. Arnold, C. S. Burton & wife, T. Williams, Mrs Jane Ferguson & daughter Mary and Mrs Morse sister in law to Bro RdMorse now presideing over the Welsh Mission. There are some few persons left who wish to emigrate, but who have not been able to get ready with our companies; so to prevent anyone being disappointed we have arranged to send them on the 16th of November pr Guion S. S. Nevada. Our Brother McAllister leaves on Saturday per. Guion S. S. Arizona, and we are exceedingly sorry to part with him. I wish he could have finished up the year with us. Bro L. R. Thomas, who has been assisting us in the office during the emigration sea-son, will hold the books until the successor of Bro. McAllister arrives. He should be a good accountant and business man. Bro Macallister has been first class help, and he is a gentleman and Latter-day Saint who appreciates the honor and privilege of being a citizen of the Kingdom of God and a standing in the Church of Christ, which many do not seem to sense, I am sorry to say. 
 Brother George F. Phillips, of whom I wrote you in my last of the 23rd inst, is still with us. I have not had any conversations with him but have let him take his own course. He has been keeping in the office. He bore a very good straitforward testimony on Sunday at our testimony meeting, and seems to feel very well in the Church. He has made covenant with the Lord by sacrifice indeed. This is an evidence to us how capable God is of per-forming His own work and bringing the seed of Israel into His fold. How many have beenled by a scrap of paper into His Church I see by the papers that our Quorum has been fil-led, which is a satisfaction to me because I think at the advanced stage of the work we ought to learn our duty to God and in-quire of Him to know who He wishes to fill vacancies. I recognize we are the Church of Christ and the order of that Church. You are the head of the High Priesthood—the chief apostle of the Church of Christ and have a right to the revelations of God. We all sustain you as a prophet, seer and revelator and ask God to reveal His mindand will unto you that His will may be done. We all want the will of God done not ours or anyone elses' but His will. It is His 
 Church we are members of, He is our Father in Heaven, our God and Redeemer, all we have we owe to Him, all we ever expect to enjoy we look to Him for, and it is natural we should be jealous for Him, that He may be sought after, inquired of, honored and obeyed. He has established His Church and He is going to extablish His kingdom with those who love Him and delight to serve Him, and who are jealous for Him. We have been a Church long enough to know something of the order of His appointing and for one I say let His order be honored and let Him be inquired of and He will direct. This is just what we are all praying for that His will may be done on earth as in heaven I say Amen with all my heart because this is just what I truly want to see. It matters little to me whom the Lord calls, for I am a brother and friend of every man who is a Latter-day Saintin good standing and full fellowship in the Church of Christ. There are so many good and competent men to day who are capable under the blessing of God of fulfilling any poition to which they might be called, but they want to be just werethe Lord wants them and to do just what He wants them to do and would not wish for any position only as they are called by Him, knowing they are all the same in His sight and their labors of equal value all working for the same recompense. 
 of reward viz—Endless lives in His glorious presence. If it is a strait and narrow way it is open to all who love God and delight to keep His commandments; members of all quorums being equally honorable. For it is not the position that makes the man, or ^is^ a sureity of success, but it is the man of God who is humble, childlike, true and faithful, enjoying the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, who makes the position an honor-able one in any quorum or in any position. The man who honors God is honored by Him in whatsoever calling or responsi-bility he is called to, Priests of the order of Aaron often being blessed in a most miraculous manner on account of their faith and good works. I am thankful for the men God has given us to be our com-panions in our Quorum and hope we shall be one with each other, and as a Quorum, and with the First Presidency, that we may be Christs', that we may be sanctified by the Truth, and he the servants of God in very deed. May the Holy Ghost be our con-stant companion that we may all see eye to eye and be a blessing to the House of Israel. May we be humble and full of love possessing 
 faith, hope and charity, being temperate in all things intrusted in our care, working out our own salvation and laboring with an eye single to the glory of God. This is my prayer, and if I had the power to confer a blessing upon the heads of my fellow ser-vants ^this^ would be the blessing I would confer upon all, with deepest love and fraternal affection. God bless the First Presidency and God bless the Twelve and unite them toge-ther as the heart of one, to bless and be blessed, and set a righteous example to all quorums, and to all Israel for brotherly love, humility, faith, hope and charity to the glory of God the Father is the prayer of His unworthy servant. With kindest love to allI remain as everYour brother & fellow laborerGeorge Teasdale.

T.Dear Brother:On Saturday last our Brother McAllister left Liverpool per. Guion S. S. Arizona. Such sudden changes are never very pleasant, especially with book keepers. Whenyour telegram reached us we were in the midst of the business of shipping off a company of Saints. Bro. Mc Allister has worked assiduously to get his books posted up and in some shape to hand over to Brother L. R. Thomas so that he could hold them and carry on the business until Bro. McAllisters' successor should be sent. Bro Mc set up the whole of Friday night working to have the accounts in good condition. Bro. Thomas is doing very well for a young man as you will see from the Balance Sheets for October. As you will soon see Bro. Mac he will give you quite a history of our doings and hand you a very handsome-ly bound large sized Book of Mormon for the Tabernacle and a Psalmody. We furnish the unbound copies and Mr Fazackerly binds them free of charge. They are exceedingly handsome and will be a pleasant souvenire 
 from old 42 Islington and our friend Fazackerly.Your greatly esteemed favors of Oct 19 and 17th have come safe to hand. The reason why Elder L. A. Kelsch did not go to Turkey was because he could not get a passport. It is no use anyone coming here without a passport, for they cannot ob-tain one in this country. Bro. Kelsch tried all he could and made it a subject of prayer but was refused and that is why we put him into the fieldHe wrote home to try and get a passport but failedSo we have appointed him President of the Bris-tol Conference where he is laboring at present.I have received letters from J. M. Sjodahl and W. H. Smart wishing to be released from the Turkish Mission through sickness. Bro.Smart writes that Bro Socander is down sick also. I enclose their letters and shall be pleased to know what to do. A few days ago I sent (£6.0.0) six pounds and an en-couraging letter to Bro Sjodahl. Bro. W. H. Smart has never had much faith in the mission since he has been there. Bro Stauffer is the only one who seems to be really doing anything. The last letter I got from Bro Hintze he seemed to be doing but little in Constantinople. He wanted £10.0.0 to get some letters or articles into the Newspaper as he could not get any printing done. With kind regards Your brother in the gospel George Teasdale 
 Br. Woodruff. Mothers, Daughters, and Sisters in Zion,I feel happy to have the privilege of meeting with you, but think it a difficult matter to speak to such a congregation.It requires the spirit of God to speak and teach the sisters in their duties. God has taken the weak things of the world to confound the wise. Said that Joseph Smith organized the Female Relief Society as he did the church by revelation; that when he did organize this Society, he had an object in view; so also did the Lord.Spoke on fore-ordination: clearly showing that the Lord known unto his servants, those things that should come to pass down to the present day. The Lord has prepared people to carry on His purposes that would not be thwarted. Said the Lord had foreordained that these mothers should come forth in this day and gen-eration to raise up a people to carry on His work.That they had a mission just as important as the Brethren, but they must be co-workers with each other. Spoke at some length upon the sisters having the power to controll the fashions; did not care how beautifully we dressed, so that it was of comly and home-made. Encouraged the sisters to cooperate in these things untill we become independent of Babylon. Referred to Brigham City as an example in cooperation.Spoke at some length on selk culture, and showed the nescessity of cultivating the mulberry tree, and encouraged the sisters to enter into this with a will. Also spoke of the laying up of grain, in case of famine—for it will surely come. Spoke of the power the sisters have in assisting to build temples and gather the poor. Spoke of the responsibility resting upon mothers in bearing children and training them to bear of this Kingdom.Said there is many trials attending the principle of Prural Marriage, but there is also the greatest blessings attending the same. Made some very pleasing remarks on this subject. Asked the blessings of God on all. Amen.

Islington, Liverpool.April 15th 1890President Wilford Woodruffand Council.Dear Brethren:On the 6th of AprilI attended a very good Conference of the Scot-tish Mission. Our priesthood meetings andassembly of the Saints were attended verysatisfactory and an excellent spirit prevailed. Last Sunday I attended the NewcastleConference and had quite a number ofstrangers attend. Although but few baptismsthe Elders have much joy in their labors. Last week Elders Carlisle, Fraser, the YoungBrothers and others arrived and received theirappointments as you will see from the MillennialStar9. On Saturday the 12th inst. Elders W. H. Smart and Richard Yeates left here forhome per S. S. AlaskaYour favor of March 22nd received. I had readin the Deseret News that two dollars was to be al-lowed the passengers from New York to Utah forprovisions, and could not understand it, butyour letter explains that this two dollars is to helppay provisions on the railroad and incidentalexpenses." I am afraid this will cause someconfusion. If two dollars is to be returned to the 
 passengers, would it not be easier to chargethem $60 sixty dollars and thus save any fur-thur trouble. The presidents of the Companieshave much to do already and to have theresponsibility of giving every passenger twodollars at New York or a part of two dollarsafter some necessary expenses have been paidwill increase his labors and make him a tar-get for the passengers to accuse and find faultwith. I think we should do all we could toprevent confusion and guard against givingroom for complaint. I was sorry when I readthe notice in the News that two dollars wasto be spent in provisions. If it had been sixtydollars for the fare and understood as here-tofore they have to provide themselves provis-ions over the R Road, they do it. But if theyknow two dollars is to be given them at NewYork for provisions they will think thatis sufficient for the journey and look tothe President to provide them. He has hadto do this ^for some^ on several occasions in the past andhave so reported to this office. We have to dealwith a jealous people and it is a thanklessposition to have to serve them. I have hadan experience with them for years and have not wondered when men apostatisedbecause of the people. The best way to handlethem is strait and give them no chance for

With regard to Thomas Galbraith I am sorry for him because he has been over come by the power of the adversary. I am satisfied he had a desire to serve God. He was going to work his way to Utah. He never asked me for any money. When I found he was deter-mined to go I thought the matter over and talked it over with Bro. McAllister and thebrethren here. One morning, before I said anything to Galbraith, I told the brethren I had concluded to offer him a loan to help him across the continent, for I thought he was honest. He had been told he would have to meet difficulties, that he was going to a new country where he was unknown and he would meet with people who would en-deavor to poison his mind, to discourage him and lead him out of the Church; but he was prepared for this he had read a great deal against the people, but he knew he

[end of sideways text]LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42, Islington, Liverpool.April 19th 1890.President Wilford Woodruff,and Council.Dear Brethren:A small company, the first of the season, left here this morning,per Guion Steam Ship Wisconsin, under the presidency of Elder Orson H. Worthington, with Edward A. Cottrell and Daniel H. Snarr as his counsellors, and Thos. E. Bassett clerk and recorder. The following named brethren returning missionaries, Timothy B. Davis, Jenkyn Thomas,T. E. Ricks Jr, Joseph H. Ward and E. L.Burgoyne. The company consisted of 43 soulswithout counting the missionaries. 32 full fares 4 halves 6 between 1 & 5 years and 1 infant = 43 souls 9 missionaries = 52. 19 were for Salt Lake City, 7 for Ogden, 2 for Nephi 7 for Provo, 1 for Evanston, 11 for Market Lake Idaho, 3 for Farmington, 1 for Logan, and 1 for Montpellier = 52.As we have received no advices concerning the fares north of Ogden and South of Spanish Fork, we have been obliged to guess at it, and have ad-ded the difference we paid last year to the places north of Ogden and South of Spanish Fork not knowing what better to do. According to your instructions we have made out the lists at $45.25/100 fortyfive dollars and twentyfive cents and opened an account with 
 had a work to do, and was willing to devote himself to the service of the Divine Master, and prepared for the difficulties and quoting scrip-ture, with which he seemed to be familiar, that the Saints would have to suffer tribulation.When I spoke to him I told him I thought himan honest man, and had come to the conclu-sion to loan him sufficient to pay his overland journey personally. I told him I did not know why I did it, because I had little faith in men,my experience had taught me that there was agreat deal of dishonesty in men, and that he need not thank me, but thank God who had softened my heart towards him to take a step I was not in the habit of doing. I told him the difficulties he would have to meet with, and that he had to establish a character amongst a people who would naturally look upon him with suspicion, because so many frauds had imposed upon them,that they wanted to know men before they were willing to invite them into theirfamilies. Galbraith heard me lecture to a Scandinavian Company, who were leaving here for Zion, telling them in my plain flat-footed way, what they might expect and the experience they would meet. And he said to me, no one could misunderstand that, and he was struck with the disposition 
 suspicion or to think they do not receive whatthey ought to receive and accuse an innocentman who happens to be their servant. I know you will pardon me for this suggestion. I only know to honestly give you my viewswhich are the result of my experience and submit them to your consideration, andthen I shall do just as you say. Withthis company that leaves here on Saturdaynext, the 19th inst, we shall give the Presidentof the company two dollars for every adultpassenger to pay expenses and furnishsome provisions. We shall instruct thebrethren with him to assist him all in theirpower. We have done so on previous occa-sions and have received word from the President of the Company that after theyleft Liverpool they took no further in-terest than to look after the Saints theywere more immediately interested in. Itis not all men who are willing to put them-selves out of the way for the convenience of others. I would suggest that if the pass-engers are to have a rebate of two dollarsthat it be given them here, on their leav-ing, and so save the President of the Com-pany, who has all he can attend to with-out this extra responsibility. I am sure the 
 the climate and he wanted to go home. We let him have the means to go as he was without and has promised faithfully to send it back to me as soon as he returns home. The Guion S.S. brings us a few missionaires and visitors. They landed here this morn-ing. The following are their names and appointments Thomas H. Woolford, to the London Conference Geo H. Robinson and Ether E. McBride to the Liverpool, Geo. Hanks, to the Bristol; Samuel Worsencroft, to the Manchester and Joseph Newbold to the Nottingham Conference; Jos S. Douglas to the Irish Mission.H. H. Akert for the Swiss & German, Ola Jenson L Dahlquist, L. J. Hernstrom, C. Olsen and Joseph R. Olsen for Scandinavia. Bro. Wm Langton and wife, Francis T. Bailey & wife, Captn J. D. Wright Doug-las Watson, Brother H. H. Thomas' wife and others whose names I have not yet got. All are in good health & spirits. They came by the S.S. Wisconsin and arrived to day. All but the missionaries have left for their destinations or friends where they are visiting.Bro J. E. Carlisle met with an accident which has somewhat lamed him. He was jammed between a tram and cab and bruised considerably. I am happy to say he has almost recovered. We learn from the papersthrough their American telegrams that "A consignment of Mormons landed at New York (14th) yesterday It is believed that these peo-ple are nothing more or less than contract laborers and it is the intention to raise that point when the next batch ofMormons is landed"—This is going the rounds of the press. We are allwell at 42 & join in love. Your brotherGeo. Teasdale. 
 Mr R. Tenbroeck at these figures and have mail-ed him names and lists of full and half faresso he can have the tickets ready for the company on their arrival. We cabled you to-day—"Fifty two sailed send Tenbroeck 1770—" The account figured at $45.25 for Passengers and missionaries was $1990.04We sent by Prest Worthington $22000 and cabled you for 1770 00/100 making $1990.04. We also gave the President of the Company (8600) Eighty six dollars to pay any necessary expenses and furnish some provisions on the journey. As an evidence of how this is understood he asked me if it could be used for provisions for the returning missionaries, or tipping the saloon stewards. To handle this emigration business re-quires experience. I do not know how we would have got along if we had a large company. It took the brethren all their time to manage this small company and sit up all night to do it, and they are good bookkeepers but not used to this busi-ness. With new hands on everything I am getting an experience in patience. Mr Ramsden is as kind and considerate as ever. Our returning mis-ionaries all had saloon passage, one of them the odd one, a cabin to himself. According to your wish we sent Bros. Ricks and Bassett, two good missionaries. There is a call for good help in nearly all the Conferences to fill the place of those leaving. With kind love to allI remain faithfully yours in the Kingdom of patienceGeorge Teasdale 
 Scandinavian brethren would have pre-ferred the fare being 6000 or 6100 sixty or sixty one dollars and all expenses paid andfind their own provisions, than the rebateOf course you may have some idea that assures you of the wisdom of therebate that I am unacquainted with, for I do not assume to have muchwisdom, I think sometimes I am verydull of comprehension and wish I had more wisdom and prudence, andcould see with clearer judgment. YetI do the best I can to my poor abilityand regret it is so poor.I am happy to say we useall reasonably well; The last attackI had gave me a severe shaking, butI am getting along wonderfully.

 to truthfulness as to the real state of affairs in Utah.Prest Woodruff you know we never offer any in-ducements, outside of the gospel of Christ. Wetell the people in Christ they will have peacebut in the world tribulation. No Elder ever of-fered any inducement to T. Galbraith to go to Zion by "false and cruel arguments." He went be-cause he wanted to go, and all the promises of tribulation, persecution and difficulties,could not deter him from going. He deceived us all. We all thought him an honest man:he possessed a testimony and enjoyed the Spirit of God, and God has been his friend and would have established him in His righteousness if he had not turned his back upon Him. Dear Brother Woodruff, there is nothing I have done I regret in this business except giving him an introduction to yourself.I humbly ask your pardon for so doing. It was done in haste without reflection and I cannot excuse myself. It is the first time I have been guilty of this unwarrantable liberty, you may depend upon it being the last. The suffering I have had in this unfor-tunate experience will certainly be a warning to me to never repeat it. The loss of the money advanced him I count a light thing. My suf-fering arises from the knowledge that an act of

Locander, who does not seem to have taken very much to Prest Hintze, on the relation of the Presiding Priesthood and necessity to labor where appointed and not leave one field for another; and to be in harmony. I have found a correspondence between T. Galbraith and Bro. McAllister which I have had copiedand forward you by this mail. I can-not express to you how deeply I am humi-liated nor how deeply I suffer because I have caused you to suffer for which I can never forgive myself. God bless you with His unspeak-able peace and comfort your heart is the earnest prayer of your unworthy brotherGeo. Teasdale 
 in the least, they cause its sectarianadvocates to tremble while in discus-sion. It is because the faith of the pseudo-Christian is a pervrsion andbuilt upon sand, that when the tideof free thought and opposition surgesagainst it its fall is sure.

 ance to us since he has been here. He is growing in-to the knowledge of the gospel, bears his testimony and is very humble and willing, does not expect any salary, and willing to go and preach the gospel. He is astonished at his own conversion, because he knows it has not been by the power, logic, or wisdom of man, and is convinced that the Lord has brought him into His Church and given him a testimony for some purpose and de-sires to fulfill anything He has for him to do.He has had quite a struggle with opposing in-fluences the pleading of his friends, and the change from having all the money he wanted to be without anything. We have not encoura-ged him at all or taken him into our con-fidence. We gave him 20/- to go home as he had been here some time and was feeling ra-ther blue and I thought if he had the means he would return, that perhaps he was to proud to ask his father after he had been so treated by him. But he did not go, and afterwards I learn-ed his sister had sent him word, she presumed he was cured of his folly by now, having found us out, and discovered what kind of people we were, and if he wished to return she would send him whatmoney he wanted. He has been quite a help to us since Bro. Brookbank has been sick. But if you would ra-ther that he should not work here, that is enough he will leave. With love, I am your brother,George Teasdale.

 It is very han[d]somly bound. Prest Brown ispushing the gospel in Holland, he wantsmore capable help. When the languagehas to be learned it is sometimes twelve toeighteen months before the Elders can preachthe gospel. He wants some help now. Thelast missionary Elder H. C. Gelderblom doesnot seem to take very well with his countrymen.The work in England is rather discouragingin baptisms and the indifference of the people.At a District Meeting held in the ManchesterConference, there was a good attendance.

The brethren have all left for their various fields of labor, after a pleasant visit in Liverpool and to their friends.I have returned from seeing the Scandinavian Company off. This is our second company of the season. There are 144 emigrants and 8 returning missionaries, also an English family of 4 persons making in all 156 souls. This company is in charge of Elder Adolph Anderson with L. Ernstrom & G. S. Bastian as his first and second counsellors. Ole Petersen, of Brigham City N. C.

His wife was only booked to New York to see if she could get a pass over the line. Mr Ramsden made Bro. Anderson & family exceedingly comfortable. The Elders all had a cabin passage and were exceeding well pleased. Your much appreciated favor of the 12th ult. came safe to hand and we have deemed it wisdom to publish most of it in the "Star"; so that all the Elders may know your mind concerning them.

 New York, Sept. 14th [18]56.Elder Woodruff,Dear Bro: On account of my absence from Washington I only received your letter of the 31st  July at thisplace the day before yesterday. I am exceedingly thankfulfor the general information your letters contain and am indeed grate--ful for the better prospects of harvest announced in your last.I have remained here for the last month expressly to get ElderTaylor to complete his account of the Murder of the Prophet.He is so buisy that it has been with difficulty that he hasbeen able to bring his mind to the task and remain at it. I am, however, extremely satisfied with the prospectsof accomplishing the work. He thinks Dan Jones' statementof the dreams ought to be considerableed reliable. Frommany conversations I have had with Bro. Markhamin relation to the subject I have formed the opinion that hismemory is so treacherous that he would unwittingly mixother circumstances with those attending Joseph's ass-assination. His statements would therefore require criticismElder Taylor is bothered for dates of days & hours.Since I wrote you I have visited  your native Statean account of which the boys will find in the Mormon.I am greatly obliged to Bro. Bullock & the clerks in the officefor keeping me posted on the affairs at home and thank youkindly for the attention to my fruit trees.I expect to go to St. Louis just as soon as ElderTaylor finishes his narrative of the conversation betweenthe Governor & the Prophet, &ce.I preached last Sunday here and according tothe announcement of the brethren in to-day's Herald Iam to lecture this evening on "Utah and the presentposition of the Mormons."Heywood has returned to Washington and has betterprospects of winding up his business affairs and hopes to 
 return to Utah this season yet. Appleby is attendinga "Wood's Meeting" to-day in New Jersey. Elder Tayloris at this moment going a head with the Governor'sconversationThe political atmosphere is as usual cloudyand betokens storms. The spirit of dis-unionis rampant and "Bleeding Kansas" is the principalcapital for the Republican party: and a battlehas to be fought every week to keep up the exite-ment.Neither Elder Taylor or myself has receivedany letters from our families by the August mailI think you will find Elr. Taylor's accountof Governor Ford's conversation with Joseph asplendid affair.Please give my kindest regards to theclerks in the office I hope that by this time theyhave something better and more substantial thanbarley-meal.  Perhaps you would say a word or two of my family in your communicationsso that if I fail to obtain their letters I may learnsomething of their whereabouts.With best affection for self & familyI am, Yours faithfully,Geo. A. Smith.[sideways text]George A SmithNew York Sept 14thAnswd April 1th 1857[end of sideways text]

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42, Islington, Liverpool,July 11th 1890.President W. Woodruffand Council.Beloved Brethren:As I was pre-paring to leave for Cheltenham to attend theBristol Conference, your esteemed favorof the 27th came to hand. I must sayit was a surprise to me as I was not look-ing for it until the fall at the end of theEmigration season. But I am a minuteman and go and come at the call of myfile leaders, for I have but one desire in lifeand that is to be where my heavenly Fatherwishes me to be. This mission has been ablessing to me and I am thankful to Himfor the experience. Last Sunday I attendeda very good Conference and Priesthood meet-ings at Birmingham, and on Sunday weekwe have a Conference of the Welsh Mission.I have received a letter from Bro. J. Jackabout an extra charge being made in thefare from Copenhagen. I have sent the letterto Prest Fjeldsted for explanations. There arealways two sides, and frequently much mis-representations, that it is always better tohear both sides before judging. I am thankful 
 to say my health is good and I am en-joying my mission. I preached the gospelyesterday to a gentleman who was here inthis room for two hours and three quarters.When I return from Cheltenham I willwrite you again, as I am a little hurriedthis morning to take the noon train. Ihave been so busy since receiving yourletter I have had no time to think. So youwill kindly excuse this hasty epistle andrest assured I shall have pleasure incarrying out your councils to the best ofmy poor endeavor.With kind love to you allbelieve me very affectionatelyYour brother in tribulationGeorge Teasdale[sideways text] Geo.
