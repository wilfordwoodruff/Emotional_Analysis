After getting  some refreshment we walked to the Church yard  and I gazed upon the silent grave of our beloved  Brother and Elder Lorenzo Barnes. My feelings were  keene and sensitive. As I stood upon his grave I  realized I was standing over the body of one of  the Elders of Israel of the horns of Joseph, of the  Seed of Ephraim, one of the members of Zions  Camp, who had travelled more than 1000 miles  in 1844 for the redemption of his persecuted,  afflicted brethren, Offered to lay down his life  for their sake, One who had the hearts and affection  of thousands both in America and England, one  who felt a deep interest in the welfare of his parents  and kindred, One whose fidelity was stronger  than death towards his Lover, his brethren  eternal truth, and his God. While Standing upon  his grave I offered up my vocal Prayer to Israels  God, that I might die the death of the righteous  when called away, and that my last end might be  as wise and safe as his and that his sacred dust  might be called forth in the morn of the first  resurrection. I decreed in my heart I  would not return to my native country untill  I had causced to be erected a tomb stone over  his grave to say to his friends that should chance  to pass that way, that here sleeps the worthy  LORENZO. D. BARNES  The first of Zions Camp who has found a grave in a foreign Land   ENDENTRY I bowed my knees upon this sacred grave and plucked  some pebbles in memory of his worth. I thought  of his FIGURE Father, his kindred  and the saints for they all loved him, and would have  thought it a privilege blessing to have been permitted  to have droped a silent tear upon his lonely bed.  O Lorenzo thou has fallen, in thy youth as it  were A marter for the truth, in a foreign  land. But if thy God permits me to tread again  the Courts of his house, in Zions land. and have  access to the sealing powers, endowments, and keys of  the kingdom of God I'll remember thee and pray  that thy exhaltations FIGURE may not come short  of the Chiefest of thy quorums   I retired from his grave in company with my  brethren meditating upon the life of Br Barnes.  I made dilligent enquiry of the family whare  he died and of others concerning his sickness and death  And I obtained the following information.     That Elder Barnes during the last of Sept  walked one day about 13 miles vary fast to get  to the rail road in time to get the cars some part of  the way he run, got into a high state of perspiration  and ownly had time to step on board just as they  were about starting. he rode on the rail road  about 20 miles, during which time he became  entirely chilled, which flung him into a sever cold  that settelled upon his lungs brought on the quick  consumption from which he never recovered He attended a conference and Preached several  times afterwards but was vary feble. The last  time he Preached was from the following words  "There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of  God" After he was confined to his bed he was  asked if he would have a Physician his answer   ENDENTRY was deffinately No. if he Died he wished to  Die a natural death. if he lived he should live  unto the Lord, if he died he should die unto  the Lord. He manifested a great desire to lifve  if it was the will of God that he might again  return to Nauvoo. He was deprived of his  reason ^during^ some portion of his sickness his  whole conversation at such times was about  Nauvoo, how he should get there, and his  friends, spoke of his mother freequently.  The night before his death, he had his reason  and bore a strong and faithful testimony of the  truth of the fulness of the Gospel as taught  by the Latter Day Saints. Stated that it would  not be long before the Kings and great men of  the earth would call for the mountains and rocks  to fall upon them to hide them from the wrath  of the Lamb of God that was to be poured out  upon the earth for soon would the nations  of the earth be deluged with the judgments of  God, and with many other words did he testify  of those things that would spedily come to  Pass. I learned that Elder Barnes  suffered by going with poor boots and wet feets  from place to Place. He was slow to make his  wants known to the brethren and some were  to slow to administer to his wants untill he  got sick. But evry attention was paid him  after he was confined to his bed but it was to  late.   I enquired if their was any writings that he  left as a Journals but could find nothing but  the following lines as a correspondance in Poetry  between himself and his intended Miss Susan Conrad  which shows the strong fidelity of his heart  which was Characterestic of the man throug evry  action of his lifife   ENDENTRY FIGURE   Lines from Susan in Hebrew Lovely Jan 1st 1842   Strive then to remember me Untill life shall scease to be Sweet twill be to think on thee And know thou dost remember me.
