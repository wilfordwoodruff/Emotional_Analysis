 Jan 4 [18]89Jacob Spori.Rexburg, Idaho,Jan. 4. 1889.Red Jan 10 [18]89and Jan 10 [18]89President Wilford Woodruff!It is only by counsel of the Stakeauthority that I take the liberty to sendthis communication:Mischa (Michael) Markoff from Servia, living in Alexandria, Egypte in 1886/87,had a dream to sell out his barbershop andtake the next Steamer for Constantinople.He did so. I happened to be on the sameSteamer, being just released from my Missionin the Orient and returning from Jerusalemvia Jaffa, Port Said, Alxexandria and Constan-tinople in January [18]87. The 1st of FebruaryM. Markoff was baptized by Br. Hintze, Tannerand myself in the Marmora Sea, and fromthe enclosed letter we learn, that Br. Hintzeordained Br. Markoff to be an Elder onthe 24.of Febr. [18]88. Br. Markoff sends me theenclosed letter, which, by counsel of theStake authrotity, I should forward to the Pre- 
 sidency of the Church. The following is thetranslation:"Elder J. Spori. Dear Brother! I let you know that I am now in Antwerp,Belgium and I have baptized 6 persons. Br. Hintze Missionary in Constantinope, or-dered me to send unto him all the namesof those who are baptized by me. I havewritten to him but received no answer.I don't know whether he is still in Constple. or not. But you know Br. Hintze; we wereall in Constantinople, Br. Tanner, Br Hintze and Br. Spori the first of Febr. 1887when they baptized me. Mischa Markoff,from Servia, by trade a barber. Later onI received the priesthood 24. Febr. 1888 byBr. Hintze. Then we two travelled togetherin Austria, but being persecuted weseparteated. I know not whether he is stillin Constantinople or not, for the lastletter from him I received in the month of April. Therefore I send you the names 
 of the baptized that you may forward themunto the President so that they might berecorded. These are the names:1. Carl Beckhouse, baptized 17. Oct. [1]888born 11 Oct. 1836 in Schwerte, Westphalia, Prussia. His paretns are Wilhelm Heinrichand Wilhelmine^a &?^ Kenhrmann. (Rohrmann (?)2. Henriette Esselmann, baptized 16/10 [1]888born 296/5 1849 in Werther, Westphalia,Prussia. Name of her father: Heinrich Esselmann, and name of her mother LouiseKipp.3. Friedrich Pieper baptized 16/10 [1]888born 26/9 1872 in Lünen Westfalen,Prussia. Parents: Gottfried Friedrich,and Henriette Esseluann.4/ Couradina Pieper baptized 19/10 [1]888 born298/97 18794 in Lünen Westphalia, Prussia, (Names of the parents not given, only thatthey lived there).5. Emma Pieper, baptized 19/10 1888born 296/9 1875. 
 6./ Mathilde Pieper, bapd. 19/10 1888,born 11/8 (11. August) 1879 in Lünen.Parents are there and they were Prote-stants before joining the Church.Dear Brother, I thank the allmighty God and Father in heaven who has shown[mg] by His servant the narrow path inthe name of the Lord Jesus ChristI thank Him all the time for instructing me to do His will.I wish you would give me answer,and also where Br. Hintze is. I wrotemany letters to him had know notwhether he received them. At the pre-sent time I am in Antwerp, Belgiumhad so not know where I shall be later.I close my letter, sending my respectsto all, Br. Sp. Bro. Tanner and all theSaints in the holy mountain of Zion andremain your affectionate Brother in ChristMischa Markow,Direct: care of ^Mr.^ Fr. Pieper, poste restanteAntwerp, Belgium."  This 
 2.This is Br. Markow's letter. I senthim a receipt for it, tried to write a good letter to him, at the same timesuggesting he should stay where he isuntil he receives some instructions.His German reciting is somewhatdeficient, as he had no schooling in thisdifficult language; he is better postedin his native langue, Servish, hetalks some 3 or 4 other languages, spokenin South eastern Europe. As far as I could see I found his a good, honestyoung man. On the "Khedivie", theSteamer that bought us from Alexandriato Constpl he told me of his long sear-chings for the true religion, and bylistening to his talkings I received theimpression that he lived a pure life. In Turkey everybody uses tabacco, but he 
 turned from this habit the next day afterbaptism. Last evening when I was ad-vised to send this letter to the PresidencyI was also told to make suggestions a boutBr. Markow, if I had any. I havenothing to say, only as those, whom he bap-tized are Germans, they might be repor-ted to Br. J. M. Stucki, Pres. of theGerman Mission, Postgasse 36, Bern, Switzerland.Respectfully I remainyoursJacob Spori.Rexburg, Idaho. 
 879 Cor. South Corona and Kentucky St[reet]s.Denver Colorado, Jan. 9, 1897.Prest. Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City,Utah,Dear Brother;I am pleased to report to you that our HeavenlyFather is open^i^ng up our way inthis city and we are finding manyfriends and we feel you were inspir-ed of the Lord to open this mission.We have been very careful to locatea hall in which to hold our regularmeetings, in a respecttable part oftown. We have succeeded in arrang-ing for a strictly first class hallwell furnuished, lighted and heat-ed, located one block east of the New York Equitable Building at No. 1646 California Street, where wewill hold regular meetings everySunday commencing at 11 a.m 
 and 7 p.m. The Elders hall ^have^ all puttheir means together to pay the rentuntil we can get others to help us.We have called upon all persons whose addressed we had and findthey have universally treated uskindly, and we are holding cot-tage meetings several nights inthe week in various parts of thecity and two cottage meetings on Sunday, but will hold our Sundaymeeting in the future in the placeabove referred to and will continue our cottage meetings as usual duringthe week.The Lord is opening our way andwe seem to be putting in the bestwork among en^t^ire strangers whoseaddresses we did not have, but ^we^ con-tinued to call upon them and willendeavor to keep on friendly and soc-iable terms.To night we hold a cottage meeting 
 in the house we have rented and have invited all the neighbors wehave chairs for. To-morrow we willhold two meetings in OverlandDistrict. The Lord has raised upmany friends there and we havefull cottage meetings and places to eat and sleep. I have appointedElders W. C. Clive and Zebedee Coltrinto labor in that district.Inclosed you will find a map of the state of Colorado, also a mapDenver city. You will see the waywe have districted the city andthe names of Elders laboring inthe several fields.We are making a special effortto reach the people by a thoroughsystem of cottage meetings duringthe week nights, and at presentit seems to be the best way to spread a knowledge of the truthamong the people as we are not 
 able to pay for a hall more thanone day in a week. The hall costs $2400 per month. We could use2000 tracts if we had them. We areasked for reading matter often, butcannot furnish ^the^ same as wehave loaned out all our booksthat we can spare.We organized a branch of theChurch Sunday Jan. 3, 1897.There are at present the follow-ing members of the church livingin Denver, and vacinity: Sister Mouldin, Ann Hawkins, Fred Kedington and wife, Edith Thet-cher, C H Heermance and wife,sister Fink, John Jones and wife,Brother Jones and Sister Ferber.Elder Herbert A White was sus-tained and set apart as the Pres-ident of the Denver branch. ElderFred J. Pack was sustained as the clerk of the Colorado mission. 
 I sent Elders John E. Woolley and Joseph H. Grant Jr. to Pueblo. I was so busy here I could not leave atpresent to accompany them. ElderWoolley reports the names of eight members of the church in that city, and that he is well entertainedand kindly received by them all, andwill commence holding meetingssoon. I will go ^to^ Pueblo as soon aswe hold a few more meetings here, and we get our missionary system a little more perfectly establishedThe population of the State of Col-orado is about 525,000. The populationof Denver City is problably about 125000125,000The brethern ^who accompanied me here^ are a choice lotof young men, and they are allworking like beavers, and go intothe collar without flinchinga particle. 
 We have requests to preach andplaces to stay in Overland TulleuroidCripple Creek and Leadville.I trusts what we are doing meets with your approval. We would be very much pleased tohave any council or suggestionsyou may feel impressed to make.We feel that our Heavenly Father has opened up our wayin a remarkable manner, andwe feel honored that we havebeen called to labor in this partof the Lords vineyard, and wefeel that thesre are hundreds andthousands of honest souls inthe state of Colorado.The excellent music and singing we are favored with hasa very geed [good] effect upon strangers^and^ I miagine [imagine] that we are enabled to get openings where it wouldotherwise be very difficult or 
 impossible SShould any of the brethernbe passing this way it wouldbe a great help to us to havethem call and speak to thepeople.The Brethern are all well anddesire to be kindly rememberedto you.Asking a kind remember-ance to y the brethern and praying God to bless you andthem. I remainYour Humble BrotherJohn W. Taylor

 48 Sand St, Brooklyn, N. Y. January. 21, 1895.Prest W. Woodruff,and Council:Dear Bretheren:Permit me to inform youthat I arrived at the above address on the9th inst. Since that time I have been en-gaged in correspondence with the Elderslaboring in the Mission; visiting Saints;holding Meetings, and endeavouring tomake myself acquainted with the conditionand needs of the field of labor assignedto me.The very unsettled state of the wintryweather here is unfavorable to extensivepersonal outside efforts just at present, 
 but the return of spring-time will nodoubt bring with it its usual life-giving energy to the mission, and to those who labor in it.As to the Mission's financialcondition I will say that on my arrivalI found the money for Jan. month's rent,and also for coal had ^been^ borrowed andpaid. Elder Pingree leaving no funds hereof Church or other, with which to meet thedemands. I find also that he took withhim all correspondence from your officerelating to the collection or use of fundsin this mission, so that I am entirelywithout instructions or funds.Another months rent will be due in a few days, and to all appearence borrowing money will again have to be resorted to,to save our Office and Meeting Room.As I formerly stated, I have no 
 Bank a/c or personal funds to drawupon for the support of the Mission,and my letter of instructions from you,does not encourage the idea of borrowing money. Please inform me at yourearliest convenience of your pleasurein regard to the course I shall persueto obtain the necessary funds for thesupport and success of this Mission.It will be my wish to travelsufficient to make myself personallyacquainted with the several fields in which the Elders are laboring, and givesuch direction to those labors as the Spiritof wisdom may suggest, which cannotbe done without means of transportation.I have only heard from a part ofthe Elders in the Mission yet, but so faras I have there seems to be encouragingprospects for the future.My health is good, & that of Elders generally, 
 Saml. SW. RichardsJany. 21 [18]95As to further ministerral help forthe mission. I will be able to expressmy views with more satisfactionwhen I am better acquinted with thatalready employed.With unfeigned love for ourRedeemer's cause, and desire for yourpersonal welfare, in which Elder Hudsonjoins me, I am, Your fellow laborerin the Ministry of Christ,Saml. W. Richards. 
 48 Sands St. Brooklyn, N. Y. Sept. 7th 1895.Prest W. Woodruff & Council:Dear Bretheren:Your's of Augt 31 inrelation to Elder Turner's family and his release toreturn home, came duly to hand. As suggested byyou it has been forwarded to him, and he informs methat he expects to leave for home about the 14th of the month.He will be missed very much from his field of laborwhich is at present very promising, and I trust it willbe your pleasure and convenience to furnish me someexperienced Elders to continue the good work begun.I have some good worthy young men in the Mission,but they are mostly without experience in the work of theministry, and for the lack of educational quaifications,diffidence and unnecessary embarrasment often prevent thatfreedom which is winning and pleasent with the people.To most successfully prosecute the work of the ministryit seems very desirable that one of experience accompany theinexperienced, as has been very profitably demonstrated inElder Turner's labors while he has been with us. 
 Elder Turner will no doubt give you his views of the needsof the field in which he has been engaged, and which Ihave expressed in a late communication to Prest Cannon.More of the Elders now here expect to be released before long;others to succeed them should be in the field before winter closesin upon them. Many are getting to hear the Gospel, but fewfeel the importance of obedience to its requirements.The health of the Elders is mostly very good, including myselfand Sister R. and are living in the spirit of their high calling.With a renewal of the request for more laborers, and anearnest prayerful desire for your continued health & happiness,I am your Brother, and fellow laborer,Saml W. Richards.Very well. Let us select some good Elderto go as requested. J. F. S.[sideways text] Saml. W. RichardsSept. 7 [18]95. [end of sideways text]

I got a letter from Br Cowley atthe same time and it was one of themost singular letters I Ever got froman Elder in the Vineyard, if He waswas in the habit of getting angry youwould almost think He was offendedat me for interfering with his missionin releasing him on account of healthHe wants to be let alone, and untram-elled in his mission so he can finishit. He would not be satisfied at allto be called home on Account of Healthso I have written to him to stay as longas he pleases and preach to the Gentilesand bring as Many into the kingdomas He can. And the ownly requirment I 
 made of him was come home 2 or 3years hence & stay long Enough to getMarried and have a boy growing upto take his place when he got to bean old man, and He might spend therest of his life in the Vineyard ifHe wanted.

 History of the St George Temple,Its Cost and Dedication and the Labor Thereon. 
 History of the St George Temple,It's Cost and Dedication and the Labor thereon.The corner stones were laid on the 10th day of March, 1873; and labor was continuedthereon until Jan. 1st 1877, when it wasdedicated to God. (See W. Woodruff's Journal of Jan. 1st, 1877 which contains the DedicatoryPrayers of W. Woodruff, Erastus Snow andB. Young, Junr., also the speech of PresidentYoung.)I, Wilford Woodruff, bear testimonythat President B. Young told me to goto work and prepare the Temple for giving En-dowments; and I made the preparation ac-cording to his acceptance. And on the9th of January, 1877, we repaired to the Templeand for the first time the Ordinance ofBaptism for the Dead was performed inthe Temple of St. George.Wilford Woodruff went into the Font, bythe direction of President Brigham Young,and administered the Ordinance of Baptismfor the first 140 persons, and confirmed thefirst person, President Young laying on handsat the same time.John L. Smith administered the Ordinanceof Baptism for the next 83 persons, making223 baptisms and confirmations during that day.Wilford Woodruff confirmed the 1st one; JohnD. T. McAllister confirmed 64; Alonzo H. Raleigh,15; Henry W. Bigler, 123, and Erastus, Snow, 20. 
 Susa Amelia Young was the first baptizedand confirmed, by W. Woodruff.President Brigham Young requested me to takecharge of the Temple, which I did. He also re-quested me to write all the ordinances of theChurch, from the first baptism and confirmationthrough every ordinance of the Church; G. Q.Cannon assisted some in this writing.And when I had finished it to the satis-faction of the President, he said to me:"Now you have before you an ensample, tocarry on the Endowments in all the Temples,until the coming of the Son of Man."On the 8th of April, 1877, W. Woodruff wasappointed in the public Assembly to take chargeof the Temple, and preside over it, and in privateconversation with the President, he said, he wanted me to take the whole charge of theTemple, and attend to all affairs connected withthe Endowments, Sealings, &c. I told himI was not able to go to the Altar and do all the seal-ings, as I had injured myself at that laborin the Salt Lake Endowment House. PresidentYoung told me to go to work, and ordain some mento help me to do the Sealing. He told me toset apart J. D. T. McAllister and David H. Cannonfo that purpose, and, if I needed more, to setthem apart. I set apart Bro. McAllisterto that work April 14th, 1877. I set apartDavid H. Cannon for the same purpose on the 27thof April. I also set apart James G. Bleak,to officiate at the Altar, 2nd March, 1881. 
 [redacted]I parted with President Young, for the lasttime in the flesh at 9:30 a.m. on April 16th 1877; when he started for Salt Lake City.Brigham Young, Junr., was very sick at the time.When I left St George, I placed the Pres-idency of the Temple in the hands of JohnDaniel Thompson McAllister, who was to pre-side over it in my absence.This is the Testimony which I, WilfordWoodruff, bear to all whom it may concern.-[Signed]- Wilford Woodruff.Salt Lake City,March 26th 1883.Length of Building 141 ft. 8 in.Width [of Building] 93 [ft] 4 [in].Height from Grade of Ground 84 [ft] to top of Parapet.Tower 31 ft.
