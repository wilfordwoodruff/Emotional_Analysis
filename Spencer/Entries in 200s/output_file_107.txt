President Wilfred Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah-  Dear Sir:    As Special Agent of the Eleventh Census for the  gathering of religious statistics, I desire to make a full and  correct return of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  Our method in other denominations is to gather the statistics by  conferences or presbyteries or associations. I understand that the  Church of which you are president is divided into stakes. I should  be glad if you would indicate who is the proper person in each  stake to gather information respecting Mormon organizations within  the bounds of his district. I have prepared schedules for this  purpose, a copy of which I enclose to you for your information, in  order that you may see what is the scope of the inquiry. I may add  that to the person who undertakes to gather the statistics of a  stake I can furnish, inaddition to this schedule, all the necessa-  ry materials for corresponding, if necessary, with congregations  in his district. I can also furnish blanks containing the general  directions which you will find on the second and third pages of 
 [7-009.]  Eleventh Census  of the   United States.    the schedule, with a place for the entry of statistics of each  congregation. These blanks I can furnish to each secretary or  other officer of a stake.    Please do not make any use whatever of the schedule sent you.    I enclose an official envelope which will bring your reply  free of postage.    Very Respectfully,  H. K. Canoll  Special Agent Eleventh Census. 
 Elder W. Woodruff (Song reporting) Spoke of the dealings  of God towards this people {Blessed the cup} and referred to the course  of the United States, and thought the cup of their iniquity was full, and  wished the Saints to remember the Rest of the U.S. in their prayers [symbol] 
 Jan 4 [18]89  Jacob Spori.  Rexburg, Idaho,    Jan. 4. 1889.  Red Jan 10 [18]89  and Jan 10 [18]89    President Wilford Woodruff!    It is only by counsel of the Stake  authority that I take the liberty to send  this communication:    Mischa (Michael) Markoff from   Servia, living in Alexandria, Egypte in 1886/87,  had a dream to sell out his barbershop and  take the next Steamer for Constantinople.  He did so. I happened to be on the same  Steamer, being just released from my Mission  in the Orient and returning from Jerusalem  via Jaffa, Port Said, Alxexandria and Constan-  tinople in January [18]87. The 1st of February  M. Markoff was baptized by Br. Hintze, Tanner  and myself in the Marmora Sea, and from  the enclosed letter we learn, that Br. Hintze  ordained Br. Markoff to be an Elder onthe 24.  of Febr. [18]88. Br. Markoff sends me the  enclosed letter, which, by counsel of the  Stake authrotity, I should forward to the Pre- 
 sidency of the Church. The following is the  translation:    "Elder J. Spori. Dear Brother! I let   you know that I am now in Antwerp,  Belgium and I have baptized 6 persons.   Br. Hintze Missionary in Constantinope, or-  dered me to send unto him all the names  of those who are baptized by me. I have  written to him but received no answer.  I don't know whether he is still in Constple.   or not. But you know Br. Hintze; we were  all in Constantinople, Br. Tanner, Br Hintze   and Br. Spori the first of Febr. 1887  when they baptized me. Mischa Markoff,  from Servia, by trade a barber. Later on  I received the priesthood 24. Febr. 1888 by  Br. Hintze. Then we two travelled together  in Austria, but being persecuted we  separteated. I know not whether he is still  in Constantinople or not, for the last  letter from him I received in the month   of April. Therefore I send you the names 
 of the baptized that you may forward them  unto the President so that they might be  recorded. These are the names:    1. Carl Beckhouse, baptized 17. Oct. [1]888  born 11 Oct. 1836 in Schwerte, Westphalia,   Prussia. His paretns are Wilhelm Heinrich  and Wilhelmine^a &?^ Kenhrmann. (Rohrmann (?)    2. Henriette Esselmann, baptized 16/10 [1]888  born 296/5 1849 in Werther, Westphalia,  Prussia. Name of her father: Heinrich   Esselmann, and name of her mother Louise  Kipp.    3. Friedrich Pieper baptized 16/10 [1]888  born 26/9 1872 in Lünen Westfalen,  Prussia. Parents: Gottfried Friedrich,  and Henriette Esseluann.    4/ Couradina Pieper baptized 19/10 [1]888 born  298/97 18794 in Lünen Westphalia, Prussia,   (Names of the parents not given, only that  they lived there).    5. Emma Pieper, baptized 19/10 1888  born 296/9 1875. 
 6./ Mathilde Pieper, bapd. 19/10 1888,  born 11/8 (11. August) 1879 in Lünen.  Parents are there and they were Prote-  stants before joining the Church.    Dear Brother, I thank the allmighty   God and Father in heaven who has shown  [mg] by His servant the narrow path in  the name of the Lord Jesus Christ  I thank Him all the time for instructing   me to do His will.    I wish you would give me answer,  and also where Br. Hintze is. I wrote  many letters to him had know not  whether he received them. At the pre-  sent time I am in Antwerp, Belgium  had so not know where I shall be later.    I close my letter, sending my respects  to all, Br. Sp. Bro. Tanner and all the  Saints in the holy mountain of Zion and  remain your affectionate Brother in Christ    Mischa Markow,    Direct: care of ^Mr.^ Fr. Pieper, poste restante  Antwerp, Belgium."  This 
 2.    This is Br. Markow's letter. I sent  him a receipt for it, tried to write a   good letter to him, at the same time  suggesting he should stay where he is  until he receives some instructions.    His German reciting is somewhat  deficient, as he had no schooling in this  difficult language; he is better posted  in his native langue, Servish, he  talks some 3 or 4 other languages, spoken  in South eastern Europe. As far as I   could see I found his a good, honest  young man. On the "Khedivie", the  Steamer that bought us from Alexandria  to Constpl he told me of his long sear-  chings for the true religion, and by  listening to his talkings I received the  impression that he lived a pure life.   In Turkey everybody uses tabacco, but he 
 turned from this habit the next day after  baptism. Last evening when I was ad-  vised to send this letter to the Presidency  I was also told to make suggestions a bout  Br. Markow, if I had any. I have  nothing to say, only as those, whom he bap-  tized are Germans, they might be repor-  ted to Br. J. M. Stucki, Pres. of the  German Mission, Postgasse 36, Bern, Switzerland.    Respectfully I remain  yours  Jacob Spori.  Rexburg, Idaho. 
 879 Cor. South Corona and Kentucky St[reet]s.    Denver Colorado, Jan. 9, 1897.    Prest. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City,  Utah,    Dear Brother;    I am pleased   to report to you that our Heavenly  Father is open^i^ng up our way in  this city and we are finding many  friends and we feel you were inspir-  ed of the Lord to open this mission.  We have been very careful to locate  a hall in which to hold our regular  meetings, in a respecttable part of  town. We have succeeded in arrang-  ing for a strictly first class hall  well furnuished, lighted and heat-  ed, located one block east of the   New York Equitable Building at   No. 1646 California Street, where we  will hold regular meetings every  Sunday commencing at 11 a.m 
 and 7 p.m. The Elders hall ^have^ all put  their means together to pay the rent  until we can get others to help us.    We have called upon all persons   whose addressed we had and find  they have universally treated us  kindly, and we are holding cot-  tage meetings several nights in  the week in various parts of the  city and two cottage meetings on   Sunday, but will hold our Sunday  meeting in the future in the place  above referred to and will continue   our cottage meetings as usual during  the week.    The Lord is opening our way and  we seem to be putting in the best  work among en^t^ire strangers whose  addresses we did not have, but ^we^ con-  tinued to call upon them and will  endeavor to keep on friendly and soc-  iable terms.    To night we hold a cottage meeting 
 in the house we have rented and   have invited all the neighbors we  have chairs for. To-morrow we will  hold two meetings in Overland  District. The Lord has raised up  many friends there and we have  full cottage meetings and places   to eat and sleep. I have appointed  Elders W. C. Clive and Zebedee Coltrin  to labor in that district.    Inclosed you will find a map   of the state of Colorado, also a map  Denver city. You will see the way  we have districted the city and  the names of Elders laboring in  the several fields.    We are making a special effort  to reach the people by a thorough  system of cottage meetings during  the week nights, and at present  it seems to be the best way to   spread a knowledge of the truth  among the people as we are not 
 able to pay for a hall more than  one day in a week. The hall costs   $2400 per month. We could use  2000 tracts if we had them. We are  asked for reading matter often, but  cannot furnish ^the^ same as we  have loaned out all our books  that we can spare.    We organized a branch of the  Church Sunday Jan. 3, 1897.    There are at present the follow-  ing members of the church living  in Denver, and vacinity: Sister   Mouldin, Ann Hawkins, Fred   Kedington and wife, Edith Thet-  cher, C H Heermance and wife,  sister Fink, John Jones and wife,  Brother Jones and Sister Ferber.    Elder Herbert A White was sus-  tained and set apart as the Pres-  ident of the Denver branch. Elder  Fred J. Pack was sustained as the   clerk of the Colorado mission. 
 I sent Elders John E. Woolley and   Joseph H. Grant Jr. to Pueblo. I was   so busy here I could not leave at  present to accompany them. Elder  Woolley reports the names of eight   members of the church in that   city, and that he is well entertained  and kindly received by them all, and  will commence holding meetings  soon. I will go ^to^ Pueblo as soon as  we hold a few more meetings   here, and we get our missionary   system a little more perfectly   established    The population of the State of Col-  orado is about 525,000. The population  of Denver City is problably about 125000  125,000    The brethern ^who accompanied me here^ are a choice lot  of young men, and they are all  working like beavers, and go into  the collar without flinching  a particle. 
 We have requests to preach and  places to stay in Overland Tulleuroid  Cripple Creek and Leadville.    I trusts what we are doing   meets with your approval. We   would be very much pleased to  have any council or suggestions  you may feel impressed to make.    We feel that our Heavenly   Father has opened up our way  in a remarkable manner, and  we feel honored that we have  been called to labor in this part  of the Lords vineyard, and we  feel that thesre are hundreds and  thousands of honest souls in  the state of Colorado.    The excellent music and   singing we are favored with has  a very geed [good] effect upon strangers  ^and^ I miagine [imagine] that we are enabled   to get openings where it would  otherwise be very difficult or 
 impossible S    Should any of the brethern  be passing this way it would  be a great help to us to have  them call and speak to the  people.    The Brethern are all well and  desire to be kindly remembered  to you.    Asking a kind remember-  ance to y the brethern and   praying God to bless you and  them. I remain    Your Humble Brother    John W. Taylor

 48 Sand St, Brooklyn, N. Y.   January. 21, 1895.    Prest W. Woodruff,  and Council:    Dear Bretheren:    Permit me to inform you  that I arrived at the above address on the  9th inst. Since that time I have been en-  gaged in correspondence with the Elders  laboring in the Mission; visiting Saints;  holding Meetings, and endeavouring to  make myself acquainted with the condition  and needs of the field of labor assigned  to me.    The very unsettled state of the wintry  weather here is unfavorable to extensive  personal outside efforts just at present, 
 but the return of spring-time will no  doubt bring with it its usual life-  giving energy to the mission, and to   those who labor in it.    As to the Mission's financial  condition I will say that on my arrival  I found the money for Jan. month's rent,  and also for coal had ^been^ borrowed and  paid. Elder Pingree leaving no funds here  of Church or other, with which to meet the  demands. I find also that he took with  him all correspondence from your office  relating to the collection or use of funds  in this mission, so that I am entirely  without instructions or funds.    Another months rent will be due in   a few days, and to all appearence borrowing   money will again have to be resorted to,  to save our Office and Meeting Room.    As I formerly stated, I have no 
 Bank a/c or personal funds to draw  upon for the support of the Mission,  and my letter of instructions from you,  does not encourage the idea of borrowing   money. Please inform me at your  earliest convenience of your pleasure  in regard to the course I shall persue  to obtain the necessary funds for the  support and success of this Mission.    It will be my wish to travel  sufficient to make myself personally  acquainted with the several fields in   which the Elders are laboring, and give  such direction to those labors as the Spirit  of wisdom may suggest, which cannot  be done without means of transportation.    I have only heard from a part of  the Elders in the Mission yet, but so far  as I have there seems to be encouraging  prospects for the future.    My health is good, & that of Elders generally, 
 Saml. SW. Richards  Jany. 21 [18]95    As to further ministerral help for  the mission. I will be able to express  my views with more satisfaction  when I am better acquinted with that  already employed.    With unfeigned love for our  Redeemer's cause, and desire for your  personal welfare, in which Elder Hudson  joins me, I am, Your fellow laborer  in the Ministry of Christ,    Saml. W. Richards. 
 48 Sands St. Brooklyn, N. Y.   Sept. 7th 1895.    Prest W. Woodruff & Council:    Dear Bretheren:    Your's of Augt 31 in  relation to Elder Turner's family and his release to  return home, came duly to hand. As suggested by  you it has been forwarded to him, and he informs me  that he expects to leave for home about the 14th of the month.    He will be missed very much from his field of labor  which is at present very promising, and I trust it will  be your pleasure and convenience to furnish me some  experienced Elders to continue the good work begun.    I have some good worthy young men in the Mission,  but they are mostly without experience in the work of the  ministry, and for the lack of educational quaifications,  diffidence and unnecessary embarrasment often prevent that  freedom which is winning and pleasent with the people.    To most successfully prosecute the work of the ministry  it seems very desirable that one of experience accompany the  inexperienced, as has been very profitably demonstrated in  Elder Turner's labors while he has been with us. 
 Elder Turner will no doubt give you his views of the needs  of the field in which he has been engaged, and which I  have expressed in a late communication to Prest Cannon.  More of the Elders now here expect to be released before long;  others to succeed them should be in the field before winter closes  in upon them. Many are getting to hear the Gospel, but few  feel the importance of obedience to its requirements.    The health of the Elders is mostly very good, including myself  and Sister R. and are living in the spirit of their high calling.    With a renewal of the request for more laborers, and an  earnest prayerful desire for your continued health & happiness,    I am your Brother, and fellow laborer,  Saml W. Richards.    Very well. Let us select some good Elder  to go as requested. J. F. S.    [sideways text] Saml. W. Richards  Sept. 7 [18]95. [end of sideways text] 
 Salt Lake City May 1st 1882    Dear Brother    I received your vary  interesting Letter, and I am thankful  to learn that you are prospering so  Well. I got a letter from Br Cowley at  the same time and it was one of the  most singular letters I Ever got from  an Elder in the Vineyard, if He was  was in the habit of getting angry you  would almost think He was offended  at me for interfering with his mission  in releasing him on account of health  He wants to be let alone, and untram-  elled in his mission so he can finish  it. He would not be satisfied at all  to be called home on Account of Health  so I have written to him to stay as long  as he pleases and preach to the Gentiles  and bring as Many into the kingdom  as He can. And the ownly requirment I 
 made of him was come home 2 or 3  years hence & stay long Enough to get  Married and have a boy growing up  to take his place when he got to be  an old man, and He might spend the  rest of his life in the Vineyard if  He wanted. President Taylor and all  the Brethren were much pleased with  his Letter; they thought there was a   snap & ring to his letter that you  hardly Ever see from an Elder in  the Vineyard for they are generally  vary glad to come home so let him  stay and do his work you ask if  I have any council for you I do not  know that I have I think you are doing  vary well as well as you can. We  have buried Br Joseph Barfoot and Brs  Jacob Gibson John Pack and Mother  Mary Ann Young are all vary low.

 History of the St George Temple,  Its Cost and Dedication and the Labor Thereon. 
 History of the St George Temple,  It's Cost and Dedication and the Labor thereon.    The corner stones were laid on the 10th day of   March, 1873; and labor was continued  thereon until Jan. 1st 1877, when it was  dedicated to God. (See W. Woodruff's Journal   of Jan. 1st, 1877 which contains the Dedicatory  Prayers of W. Woodruff, Erastus Snow and  B. Young, Junr., also the speech of President  Young.)    I, Wilford Woodruff, bear testimony  that President B. Young told me to go  to work and prepare the Temple for giving En-  dowments; and I made the preparation ac-  cording to his acceptance. And on the  9th of January, 1877, we repaired to the Temple  and for the first time the Ordinance of  Baptism for the Dead was performed in  the Temple of St. George.    Wilford Woodruff went into the Font, by  the direction of President Brigham Young,  and administered the Ordinance of Baptism  for the first 140 persons, and confirmed the  first person, President Young laying on hands  at the same time.    John L. Smith administered the Ordinance  of Baptism for the next 83 persons, making  223 baptisms and confirmations during that day.    Wilford Woodruff confirmed the 1st one; John  D. T. McAllister confirmed 64; Alonzo H. Raleigh,  15; Henry W. Bigler, 123, and Erastus, Snow, 20.   
 Susa Amelia Young was the first baptized  and confirmed, by W. Woodruff.    President Brigham Young requested me to take  charge of the Temple, which I did. He also re-  quested me to write all the ordinances of the  Church, from the first baptism and confirmation  through every ordinance of the Church; G. Q.  Cannon assisted some in this writing.  And when I had finished it to the satis-  faction of the President, he said to me:  "Now you have before you an ensample, to  carry on the Endowments in all the Temples,  until the coming of the Son of Man."    On the 8th of April, 1877, W. Woodruff was  appointed in the public Assembly to take charge  of the Temple, and preside over it, and in private  conversation with the President, he said, he   wanted me to take the whole charge of the  Temple, and attend to all affairs connected with  the Endowments, Sealings, &c. I told him  I was not able to go to the Altar and do all the seal-  ings, as I had injured myself at that labor  in the Salt Lake Endowment House. President  Young told me to go to work, and ordain some men  to help me to do the Sealing. He told me to  set apart J. D. T. McAllister and David H. Cannon  fo that purpose, and, if I needed more, to set  them apart. I set apart Bro. McAllister  to that work April 14th, 1877. I set apart  David H. Cannon for the same purpose on the 27th  of April. I also set apart James G. Bleak,  to officiate at the Altar, 2nd March, 1881. 
 [redacted]    I parted with President Young, for the last  time in the flesh at 9:30 a.m. on April 16th 1877;   when he started for Salt Lake City.    Brigham Young, Junr., was very sick at the time.    When I left St George, I placed the Pres-  idency of the Temple in the hands of John  Daniel Thompson McAllister, who was to pre-  side over it in my absence.    This is the Testimony which I, Wilford  Woodruff, bear to all whom it may concern.    -[Signed]- Wilford Woodruff.    Salt Lake City,  March 26th 1883.    Length of Building 141 ft. 8 in.

 [sideways text] Miss Lucy E Woodruff [end of sideways text]    Aug 9, 1885    My Dear Grand Daughter Lucy E.    On my return from a Journey of 28 days  to Fish Lake & back I found 20 letters  awaiting me among the number your  Letter of 24 July, which I was much pleased  to get, and Esspecially to see that you  are making yourself suseful as clerk  to your Grand Pa, you cannot do  to much for him. I have thought  if you could go to the University  as a Normal, ^&^ pass as such, & take  a school it would be a good think^g^ for  you. I think you would make a   good Teacher I dont think I have Ever  weighed your patience, it takes a good  deal to make a teacher. I went to Fish   Lake to attend the Young Mens Mutual conference  It was a Big Meeting It was in a small vallie  in the top of the Mountains 9000 feet high it  took 6 or 8 minutes to boil Eggs could not boil  potatos at all in time for a Meal the Lake was  clear, cold, water 7 miles long 1 1/2 wide we mea- 
 sured it from shore to shore one third of the way  from the ENorth End [FIGURE] and found the  following Depths 50 feet x 75 x 132 x 153 x 162.  The Depth 168 1/2 x 125 x 55 x 3 feet deep at each  shore The Lake aboundsed with fine Laye Trout  I caught 62 in the outlet of the Lake with  a hook we had plenty of fish to eat. We   had the Largest Assemble of an people  who Ever met there we had 1136 persons  187 vehicles & 516 Animals I spoke a few  moments on Saturday, Expected to speak  sunday but I took such a cold on   Saturday night I could scarsly speak at  all on Sunday I was vary hourse but  I did attempt it a few moments but I think  Every body was glad when I stoped, if they was  not I was, for it distressed me much  to speak. I found vary hot weather  since my Return Thermometer Registering from  100 to 12 112 to hot to sleep nights. I   am sending this in your Fathers Letter He  will give it to you when He has a change  Give my Love to Grand pa Smith & all the family    Your Affectionate Grand pa W Woodruff
