We travelled on the Road that  Elder Branes had walked over many scores of  times in Preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ I felt solumn indeed. was filled with meditation  untill I arived at Idle containing a Population of   ENDENTRY    ENDENTRY  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints  of 37 members. We called upon Elder Thomas  Cordingly &amp; his family who had the care of  Elder Barnes through his sickness &amp; death, they  Pointed out the house &amp; room to me whare he  was sick spent his last hours, passed through his  last sickness afflictions &amp; Death. After getting  some refreshment we walked to the Church yard  &amp; I gazed upon the  Brother &amp; Elder Lorenzo Barnes. My feelings were  keene &amp; sensitive. As I stood upon his grave I  realized I was standing over the body of one of  the Elders of Israel of the horns of Joseph, of the  Seed of Ephraim, one of the members of Zions  Camp, who had travelled more than 1000 miles  in 1844 for the redemption of his persecuted,  afflicted brethren, Offered to lay down his life  for their sake, One who had the hearts &amp; affection  of thousands both in America &amp; England, one  who felt a deep interest in the welfare of his parents  and kindred, One whose fidelity was stronger  than death towards his Lover, his brethren  eternal truth, &amp; his God. While Standing upon  his grave I offered up my vocal Prayer to Israels  God, that I might die the death of the righteous  when called away, &amp; that my last end might be  as wise &amp; safe as his &amp; that his sacred dust  might be called forth in the morn of the first  resurrection. I decreed in my heart I  would not return to my native country untill  I had causced to be erected a tomb stone over  his grave to say to his friends that should chance  to pass that way, that here sleeps the worthy  LORENZO.

I made dilligent enquiry of the family whare  he died &amp; of others concerning his sickness &amp; death  And I obtained the following information.     walked one day about 13 miles vary fast to get  to the rail road in time to get the cars some part of  the way he run, got into a high state of perspiration  &amp; ownly had time to step on board just as they  were about starting. he rode on the rail road  about 20 miles, during which time he became  entirely chilled, which flung him into a sever cold  that settelled upon his lungs brought on the quick  consumption from which he never recovered He attended a conference &amp; Preached several  times afterwards but was vary feble. The last  time he Preached was from the following words  "There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of  God" After he was confined to his bed he was  asked if he would have a Physician his answer   ENDENTRY  Die a natural death. if he lived he should live  unto the Lord, if he died he should die unto  the Lord. He manifested a great desire to li if it was the will of God that he might again  return to Nauvoo. He was deprived of his  reason ^during^ some portion of his sickness his  whole conversation at such times was about  Nauvoo, how he should get there, &amp; his  friends, spoke of his mother freequently.  The night before his death, he had his reason  &amp; bore a strong &amp; faithful testimony of the  truth of the fulness of the Gospel as taught  by the Latter Day Saints. Stated that it would  not be long before the Kings &amp; great men of  the earth would call for the mountains &amp; rocks  to fall upon them to hide them from the wrath  of the Lamb of God that was to be poured out  upon the earth for soon would the nations  of the earth be deluged with the judgments of  God, &amp; with many other words did he testify  of those things that would spedily come to  Pass. I learned that Elder Barnes  suffered by going with poor boots &amp; wet feets  from place to Place. He was slow to make his  wants known to the brethren &amp; some were  to slow to administer to his wants untill he  got sick. But evry attention was paid him  after he was confined to his bed but it was to  late.    left as a Journal the following lines as a correspondance in Poetry  between himself &amp; his intended Miss  which shows the strong fidelity of his heart  which was Characterestic of the man throug evry  action of his lifife   ENDENTRY        Untill life shall scease to be Sweet twill be to think on thee And know thou dost remember me.
