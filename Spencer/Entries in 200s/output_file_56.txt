 Levan Utah  Nov 28th 1893    Wilford Woodruff Esq.  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother,  Your favor of 24th Inst. is before me,   and contents noted. Will say in reply, that  this coll was rather unexpected to me,  and it finds me in a condition, that  it will be very inconvient, for me to start  of as early a date as Jan 20th 1894.  As my Father being Supt, of our Coop  Stores, and he being in California for  the Winter, has left his buisness in my  charge. This places me in a condition  that I will not be able to start on my  Mission untill about June 1st 1894. Also  money is very scarce, and by June. I will  have money from my wool &c.

My circumstances are,  however, in such a condition

 IDANHA WATER.    Consists of samples of Natural Mineral Water representing  Soda Springs, Bannock County, Idaho.  The Springs were mentioned in the early Geological exmina-  tion under Gen. John C. Fremont, and the locality has been known as a  health resort for the past thirty years.  The bottling and sale of this Water has become one of the  chief industries of this County. The Water possesses the happy qual-  ity of blending with Wine and Liquors without giving discoloration or  precipitation. It is pleasing to the taste, healthful, and exercises  a mild beneficial medicinal effect.    Sworn statements duly acknowledged accompanying the exhibit  show that the Water is bottled just as it flows from the Springs with  its own excess of natural carbonic acid gas.    The accompanying is an analysis made under the supervision of  Prof. C. F. Chandler, M.D., the well known analyst.    ANALYSIS.  Chloride of Sodium, - - - - - 15.1972 Grains.

 Salt Lake City, Dec. 16, 1893  President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother,    I am just in receipt  of your letter of Dec. 6th inst. notifying  me of my having been called to  go on a mission to England and  in answer to the same will say  that I am willing to fill said mis-  sion or any other to which you may  see fit to call me, but under exist-  ing circumstances cannot possibly be  ready before April Conference.    The circumstances to which I refer   are as follows; first, I am ^one of two^ executors for  the estate of my brother-in-law Stephen  Hanson, of which estate Bro. Jas. H.   Moyle is attorney, and he informs me  that said estate cannot be settled  satisfactorily until the latter part of  March. Owing to circumstances I have  practically had charge of the estate and,  Bro. Moyle says my presence would ma-  terially aid in settlement.    Also, through the death of my step-  father; Brother William Beardshall,   which occured last August, I am one  of three executors in his estate.

Dear Brother,    Having received a letter from you  dated Nov. 23. 1893, calling me as a  Missionary to Scandinavia, to leave  Salt Lake City, Jan. 6, 1894.    I feel very thankful to be counted  worthy for said labor.  I have been  trying to get the nessecery funds,  but as yet have not succeeded, and  thinking it time to answer.    I would be willing and glad to go  and do what the Lord requires of me  if my financial circumstances would  permit.    Your Brother in the Gospel,  Louis M. Christiansen.    James A. Allred  Bishop    Let him have  what time he needs  and when he gets   ready, he can report  J. F. S.   
 The business of one of the executors  has called him away for the Winter  and as there are law suits now pend-  ing as a result of Mr Beardshall's  loose way of doing business, it is  necessary for the present, for two of  the executors to be here to transact  the business.

He is however peaceable disposed, but is lacking in the   "counterpoise" of gravity to insure steadfastness of character  so necssary to success in life.    Religiously: In belief and sympathy he's is   an advocate of the faith and doctrines, of the church  I have never known him to utter a syllable against   any principle taught by authority. He is more loud  in his praises of our people, than he is forceable in  his examples. He is kind and attentive to his parents  when at home. And eulogizes their characters in   their absence. But he does what pleases himself. He  attends Tabernacle services occasionally, but rarely   attends any other meetings. It pains me to have to   draw such a portrait of our son. We pray for him and   earnestly hope our prayers will be answered.    Your brother in the Gospel  G G. Bywater

 I have utterly failed to live up  to my privileges as an Elder, and  am therefore totally unprepared  to preach the gospel.    At present I am considerably  involved; having several large note  out, the Interest on which I am  not able to meet, nor can I dispose  of property just now to cancel these  notes or I would be more than  willing to do so. In conclusion  would state that the depression  in business matters unables me  to determine just how long it  will take me to straighten up  my business affairs.    Yours Very Resptfully,    Nephi W. Schofield    T. H. G.

 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS'  MILLENNIAL STAR.    "And now why tarriest thou?  arise, and be baptized, and wash away  hy sins, calling on the name of the Lord." --ACTS XXII: 16.    No. 0 Vol. LVIII.   Thursday, May 14, 1896.   Price One Penny.    DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.    The following discourse was delivered by President Wilford Woodruff at  the General Conference of the Church, in the Tabernacle, Salt LakeCity,  April 5, 1896:--    The hghest calling the Lord ever called any human being to, in any  age of the world, has been to receive the Holy Priesthood, with its keys  and powers, and to be called to go forth to the inhabitants of the earth  and teach them the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and to qualify  and prepare them for a part in the first resurrection and to go back into  the presence of God, their Creator, to dwell in glory worlds without end.  The Lord bestowed that blessing, that Priesthood and that power in the  beginning of creation.  Father Adam was called of God and ordained to  the fullness of the Melchisedek Priesthood--ordained to the highest office  and gift of God to man on earth.  Adam bestowed that blessing upon  seven of his sons--Seth, Enose, Jared, Canann, Mahalaleel, Enoch and   Methuselah.  They were all ordained High Priests by their father Adam  and possessed the privilege and the right to understand the Gospel of  Jesus Christ and to give it to the human family, so that they might  qualify and prepare themselves for eternal life.  In tracing the history  of the dealings of God with men from that day to this, we find the Lord  has in various dispensations and times given unto the sons of men that  blessing.  Israel had it in the beginning, from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob  down, and until Moses, who traveled with the children of Israel forty  years in the wilderness.  They had the gifts and graces of that Priesthood  bestowed upon them, and they had the privilege of magnifying their  callings and preparing themselves for eternal life.  But Israel would not  accept the Melchisedek Priesthood, and therefore it was taken from them,  and the Lesser Priesthood was conferred upon them while they traveled

Woodruff    Your favor of 4th inst. just  at hand, releasing me for the present from  taking a mission to Scandinavia, Since  writing you I have been thinking the  matter over and have been looking around  to see what I could do, my oldest Son  has promished to Stay at home while  I go on this mission, and I have also  found where to borrow some money  and taking everything into consideration  I feel that perhaps my circumstances  are as good now as they will be in the  future, and as I feel that I shall have  to perform this mission at some time  and unless you have made arrangements  to fill my place I think that Ishould  prefer to go now. Kindly advise me as  soon as possible.   Yours truly  Soren Peterson    see over
