He is more loudin his praises of our people, than he is forceable inhis examples. He is kind and attentive to his parentswhen at home. And eulogizes their characters in their absence.

 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS'MILLENNIAL STAR."And now why tarriest thou?  arise, and be baptized, and wash awayhy sins, calling on the name of the Lord." --ACTS XXII: 16.No. 0 Vol. LVIII.   Thursday, May 14, 1896.   Price One Penny.DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.The following discourse was delivered by President Wilford Woodruff atthe General Conference of the Church, in the Tabernacle, Salt LakeCity,April 5, 1896:--The hghest calling the Lord ever called any human being to, in anyage of the world, has been to receive the Holy Priesthood, with its keysand powers, and to be called to go forth to the inhabitants of the earthand teach them the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and to qualifyand prepare them for a part in the first resurrection and to go back intothe presence of God, their Creator, to dwell in glory worlds without end.The Lord bestowed that blessing, that Priesthood and that power in thebeginning of creation.  Father Adam was called of God and ordained tothe fullness of the Melchisedek Priesthood--ordained to the highest officeand gift of God to man on earth.  Adam bestowed that blessing uponseven of his sons--Seth, Enose, Jared, Canann, Mahalaleel, Enoch and Methuselah.  They were all ordained High Priests by their father Adamand possessed the privilege and the right to understand the Gospel ofJesus Christ and to give it to the human family, so that they mightqualify and prepare themselves for eternal life.  In tracing the historyof the dealings of God with men from that day to this, we find the Lordhas in various dispensations and times given unto the sons of men thatblessing.  Israel had it in the beginning, from Abraham, Isaac and Jacobdown, and until Moses, who traveled with the children of Israel fortyyears in the wilderness.  They had the gifts and graces of that Priesthoodbestowed upon them, and they had the privilege of magnifying theircallings and preparing themselves for eternal life.  But Israel would notaccept the Melchisedek Priesthood, and therefore it was taken from them,and the Lesser Priesthood was conferred upon them while they traveled
