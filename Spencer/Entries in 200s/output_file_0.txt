Farmington Hartford County Ct Sept 30th 1839  My Dear Phebe  In the midst of my Fathers family I once more take up my pen to convers with you a few moments. I have delayed writing longer than I should but I have been waiting for a letter from you I have had the greatest anxiety to hear from you and Sarah E. and the friends around you but as yet I have not had that privilege When I passed through Buffalo I sent to the Post Office by the Captain of the boat that carried me to Albany and he found no letter there for me I am in hope that I shall find one from you when I arive at New York for I have great anxiety about you to know if you and the babe are sick or well I have seen you twice since I left home (in dream) and from what you told me the last time I did not know but you was sick or had a poor turn but I hope mot at any rate I want to hear from you. I have much I should be glad to say to you at this time but I must be brief as Eunice will write some on this sheet: you will wish to hear a word concering my journey On the 21st Aug I left Rochester and the Island friends On the 24th I was in Modesett a Saint visited the buying burying yard obtained much information concernig Adams On the 30th spent the night with the family of James Townsend he had gone with a team from home they had all been sick with the Ague and fever Sept 1st Sundy I preached to a congregation of Germons Brother Taylor followed me while he was speaking I sat by a window the wind blew upon me and I had a chill and fever that eveng I had been gaining in health untill that time I continued my journey in the morning but the ague again left me I continued my journey to Clevland by land at which place I arived on the tenth of Sept enjoying pretty good health I took boat on Lake Erie on the 10th I noticed however ENDENTRY with peculiar feelings as I journied by land the places whare you suffered with your sickness Eunice’s handwriting, Wilford’s words with regard to crossing the Lake, we had a very tedious time of it. were caught in a line storm, and was in it 3 days on our way to Buffalo, at which place on the 13th we ^I^ took line boat for Albany, arrived at Albany on the 19th. during which time in consequence of the cold I took on the Lake with the crowded situation of the boat, caused a return of the chills and fever, which I had every day for the last week of my journey. I took stage at Albany at 10 oclock at night, travell'd through the night, and also the next day, and finally arrived at Wheelers, the next morn being the 21st of Sept. I arrived at Farmington, and had the happy privilege thro’ the blessing of God, of once more meeting Fathers household face to face, have now been at home about 10 days and immediately on my return home as I began to be recruited from my journey, my health began to amend, and did not have my turns of fever and ague, although I have felt the effects of it in some degree from day to day, but I would here say that I have felt perfectly easy as regards the affliction of my body feeling confident that I shall soon recover my usual health. and I would here say as before that I do not wish you to give yourself an uneasiness as it regards my health, only give me your prayrs, and all will be well. I would just also remark that I lacked nothing on my journey as it regards my temporal wants, and had 50 cents left when I arrived at Fathers, and my purse is beginning to be replenished so that I shall be enabled to continue my journey in a few days. since at home I have had an interview with most of the Saints that belong to this small branch of the church. Uncle Dwight— Webster andc. were among the number, and I felt truly ^to^ rejoices before the Lord to find them firm in the faith and holding fast whereunto they had attained, and determined to do the will of the Lord henceforth, and they have a Zion spirit desiring to gather with the Saints. I would say that my Grand mother, Anna Thompson, departed this life a day or two since. was buried yesterday. We have visited Uncle Adna Hart found him quite low and to all appearance near the borders of the grave. as it regards the rest of our friends they are usually well, I have not as yet heard from any of our friends in Ilus in New York.  Give my respects to Sisters Montrose from head to foot inasmuch as you have an apportunity, tell brother Hawley that I have had an interview with his brothere in law Mr Satler, he was very anxious to see him. I must now draw to a close as Sister Eunice will fill the remainder of this sheet, b I hope I shall be gratified with a Letter from you before I leave New York.  I still remain yours in the strongest ties, Wilford Woodruff  still in Eunice’s handwriting Mrs Phebe Woodruff  N.B. I would here remark that I discovered your “petition” soon after leaving home and was highly edified with the spirit thereof thereof and I pray God my heavenly Father at all times to answer all such prayrs that may ascend in our behalf. W. ENDENTRY Farmington Oct. 1st.  Dear Sister As Willford has reserved for me a page to fill, I will now cheerfully (tho’ in something of a hurry) seat myself to pen you a few lines. I recieved your Letter at the hands of my brother and was truly glad to hear from you, was sorry however to hear of the ill state of your health as also that of your family, but how it will soon be improved. Wilford as you are aware is quite unwell, and we feel as you write, much anxiety respecting him, as he is about to undertake such a journey. and it seems to me as tho’ I could not have him leave us so soon, but then, we know that God has called and said “Go”, and shall we worms of the dust say stay' Nay, but let us rather rejoice that he is accounted worthy to become a messenger from God to the nations of the earth. but still my natural feelings at times gain the ascendency and I can hardly reconcile myself to have him leave us. I need not say that W. is a brother that I set much by of this you probably are aware. but as Asahel is gone, my affections return with double force upon Willford. I place confidence in him as I formerly did in Asahel, looking to him, as a friend and protector, I hope however I shall not forget that my comforts and blessings flow from God, the bountiful giver of all good,  I suppose I shall have to be brief at this time, but I shall write you from time to time page torn shall hope to hear from you often, and do give us a particular account of things and page torn with you, for we shall ever be glad to hear, and also as it respects the situation of the church. I would ask no greater blessing than to be permitted to take up my residence with the Saints with the Saints at the west, I would be willing to undergo many earthly privations. I have felt as tho’ I should like it much could I be with you whilst W. is gone his mission, but I suppose it would not be considered consistent at present. but I do feel as tho’ I should be permitted e'er long, to stand on Mount Zion with the blessed company. pray for me Sister, that I may live in such a manner as to be accounted worthy to escape the just judgments of God abroad in the land, and finally have a standing given me with the saints of God. I have been quite unwell most of the time since W. has been at home and consequently have not received as much pleasure in hearing him converse upon this Latter day work, as I otherwise should have done. but we have had a very pleasant with him, and shall remember it with much pleasure. the greatest complaint I make is that I have not had scarcely any apportunity of conversing with him myself. I hope the Lord will grant that he may have grace given him to perform his mission acceptably. that the Lord would be with him and bless him continually. grant him with the rest of the company a safe and pleasant journey over the waters and when their mission is fill'd return them safe to the bosom of their friends.  My best wishes for the welfare of yourself and babe, I remain yours, Sister Eunice ENDENTRY Mrs Phebe Woodruff.

Woodruff farmington and Eunice Sept 30, 1839 ENDENTRY Commerce July 18th 1840  My Dear Willford  I think that you will believe me when  I say that it is with peculiar feelings that I commence this sheet to you  my dear Willford what will be your feelings when I say that yesterday  I was called to witness the departure of our little Sarah Emma from this  wold world- yes she is gone — the relentless hand of death has snatched her from  my embrace — but Ah! she was to lovely to kind to affectionate to live in  this wicked world — when looking on her I have often thought how I should feell to part with her I thought I thought could not live  without her especially in the absence of my companion - but she is gone the Lord has taken her to himself for some wise purpose — It is a severe  trial for me to pass through particularly so in you absence but the  Lord has stood by me in a wonderfully manner I can see and feell that  he has taken her home and will take better care of her than I possibly  could for a little while untill I shall go and meett her — Yes Willford we have one little angel in heaven and I think it likely her spirit  has visited you before this time — I do not know how to live without her she I used to call her poor pa-pa and pretty pa-pa many times in a day  she left a kiss for her pa-pa just with me just before she died — she  eat her dinner as well as usuall thursday about 4 oclock she was taken with a prestness for breath we done every thing for her that we  could called for the elders and had her anointed a number of times and  hands laid on her but all to no avail the next day her spirit took its flight from this to another world without a groan so that now I am dep- rived of every thing near and dear to me but my little darling Willford  for the things of the world are empty and vain to me and he is not verry  well — Today Willford and I with quite a number of our friend ac- compaings us came over to Commerce to pay our last respects to our little darling in seeing her decently buried — she had no relatives to follow ENDENTRY her to her grave or to shed a tear for her but her Willford  I have engaged brother Stephen Luce to make a little fence around her grave. I am now at brother Pettys writing verry near the graveyard. The brethren and sisters are verry kind. Brother Morris Phelps officiated at the grave and is to preach her funeral sermon next sabbath the 26th of july. While on the way to the grave I met with brother  England and would take  the a letter for me I therefore take this opportunity of informing you of  our loss. — — I have just been to take a solemn  pleasing melancholly walk even to Sarah's grave, O what would  I give if my W. could be with me there, she lies alone in peace I can say that the Lord gave her and the Lord hath taken her away and  blessed be the name of the Lord, — he is wise in all his purposes. My health is quite good now, I have not heard from Connecticut of late I am getting along comfortably for temoral things at present, I have just heard that brother Joseph a letter of late in regard to  your quorum's comeing home next fall and that he said that he should  not advise you any thing about it but he said that you would all be at home next fall, I think he is expecting you, however you must try to do right about it. The situation of the church is quite precarious at present but  I can dont feel like telling you much about it at present but shall  give way for brother Petty to do that. This is the sixth letter I have sent you  since you left N.Y. and have received 3 from you the last was dated April 24. Sister Alexander. I shall write again soon. May the Lord bless preserve and return you home again is the prayr of your sorrowfull and afflicted companion. P, W, Woodruff  Dear Brother it with pleasure I embrace this opportunity of  writing you a few lines in which I can inform you that we are expecting some difficulties with the state of Missouri (or at lest there seems to be some probability that there may be something ENDENTRY of the kind take place soon there was a company of 17 Missourians armed came of over Warsaw and kidnaped 4  of our bretherens and carried them over the river and whiped two of  them almost to death The names of those that they whiped is Noah Rogers and the other by the name of Alansow Brown bro. Alred they striped and tied to a tree and drawed the lash over him but did not whip him brother Brown they hung up by the neck  until he was almost dead. Pretending they had stolen some goods from a little town where they had the bretheren ^prisoners^ called Missouri and they thus tortured them to make them confess and they would not receive any thing for a confession only what they would dictate so to save  life the bretheren confessed what they wished. finally bro. Brown ran away from them and they set brother Alred at liberty and sent the rest to  Palmyra Jail where they are at this time all this without any eveden ce of their guilt and we have petitioned the govenor of this state  to have them brought back and those ^that^ have thus abused them brought  back to Justice which we think the govenor of Missouri will  not comply with and if not it will end in difficulties between the  State of Illinois and Missouri as govenor Carlin says he is determined  to carry it it out according to the strict letter of the law. the church has been talking of making a settlement on the lines between Missouri and Iowa which gives the Missourians a good deal of uneasiness they say we have formed a conspiracy with the Indians and are goin there  for that purpose and the was fifty brethren started from here to go and  the report has gone they was fifty to start every weeks which does  much perplex them the very much alarmed at the aspect  of affairs we are at peace here the people are generally  friendly I have considerable to write you but have not page torn time at present I am much hurried they are waiting for me to go to meeting with the best of feelings I subscribe myself your friend and brother in the Lord Albert Petty  Dear Brother Woodruff being priveledge with a space  is sister Woodruffs letter I gladly improve it and I can say to you that I  and Smoot is on a mision to the south I had a letter  from him June th 12 he was in Jackson, Co, Ten be had just arrived  and was well he wanted to hear what Bro Woodruff was doing in  England I too Bro Woodruff with your wiffe have been called to wit ness the fall of one of the lovleiest flowers that ever bloomed yes your lit tle lovly Sarah is no more in this life She is gone to dwell among the blest yes She expired in my arms I done the last honor to her that was in my pow er I closed her precious little eyes washed her dressed her kissed her again and again  an to day with her weeping mother consigned her to the grave to wait till gabriel  trump sound then may we all meet her is the prayer of yor sister in Christ  sister Woodruff has gon to visit Sarahs grave site            Margaret T Smoot  ENDENTRY Mr. Willford Woodruff Care of H.

I have not heared from you  for nearly 5 months untill now, and I have been left to wonder at it, some  times thinking that you might be in prison, or where you could not write  I have felt more than common lonely of late, for what reason I do not know  but your letter came to hand the 24th of June bearing date of April 24 which  was cordially received. I was pleased to hear of your health and prosperity in  the ministry but sorry to hear that you had not received any of my letters,  this is the 5 one that I have written you since you left N.Y. one of and they  were writen verry ful I told you how things were with me in  them. I directed three of them to England,  another to W. Woodruff in care of Alfred Cordon  page torn club buildings, Navigation  rode Staffordshire England according to the directions in your letter written from Jan. 29. and this ^I^ shall direct to Liverpool in care  of John Taylor hopeing that you will be more likely to get it. I sent one  by brother Page when they started on their mission to the  Jews. I have received three from you since you arrived in England  one dated Jan. 12th another 29th then this last one April 24. I do hope  that you will get them ^mine^ for I wrote much that you would like to  know about my situation, house, cow, sickness, moveing from Lovely street  to father Clarks, andc, andc, which if you have not heard might be inter esting to you. as it is quite a task for me to write now haveing two  little one around ^one^ and poor health (yet I have taken the utmost pains  to write to you since you left home) I will give you a brief sketch  of these things. You left  me in Montrose, I kept about the house 2 weeks after,  then was taken with the chills and fever went out to sister Smoots stayed  there about 10 weeks was confined to my bed the most of the time for days and days  ENDENTRY could not sit up to have my bed made, I was brought verry low in consequence  of my situation little Sarah Emma was verry sick at the same time both of our  lives  were nearly dispaired of but through the mercy of God I got some better  so that as soon as my house was called done I went into it, it had no door  window or loft in it, and it was a hard matter for me to get it done any way they  seamed unwilling to do it, I had no shelter for the cow and was much trou bled to get wood, my house was verry open I was alone the most of the time,  but could not sit up only a part of the time. I often felt that I was alone,  a stranger in a strange land sick and ill provided for with my little Sarah clin ging around me as though she had no other friend to look to for protection and  not knowing how it might turn with me would often cause me peculiar feelings,  but I would often look back and ask myself the question did I leave my fathers  house for the sake of honour, ease, or popularity, I think I did not but for the word of  God then I would try to be reconciled to my situation but I found it to be verry  hard work in the situation that I then was in— once I had a kind Willford to cheer  me in my lonely hours, but then I had none. I lived in my house about 2  months and quite as long as I wished in the situation that it was then in. Father  Clark learned the situation that I was in he invited me to go to his house  and spend the winter with ^then^ Sarah and my cow and calfe, and when I felt able  to sew some for his family I accepted the invitation and am here now, in the  spring he asked me to stay untill fall I have concluded to do so as they are building  houses for the wives of the 12 in Commerce I shall probably voo move there in  the fall I have flattered myself that I should have my Willford to help me move  then, as I have moved 4 times since you left. Father John Smith lives in  my house now in Lovely street it was fitted up for for his family. Tell brother George  Smith that his father and family are well have lately received a letter from him  and sent an answer to it— I wrote a little in it to you as I was there on a visit.  I have just returned from a visit to Commerce and that neighbourhood the first  one I have made since you left home— I was gone 3 weeks Brother Petty has  returned from the South and settled in Commerce brother Stephen Luce and  brother Ephraim Luce lives  on the west side of the river. The brethren have a got a big field as they call it  in brother Smoots neighbourhood it contains about 300 acres of land he  (Smoot) has lately gone out on a mission for six months, brother Webster  from Connecticut has gone with him he has been here and spent a week with  me and brought me a letter from Mother Woodruff they were weell and  mentioned haveing received a letter from you— I shall write to them as soon  as I finish this- I found brother Webster to be a fine man. I suppose you knew  that he and Eunice were engaged to each other - he told me all about it when he  was here. Sarah Milliken expects to be married soon to a man out of the church  he has lately joined the universal church so you can see how much faith ^he has^ in mormon ism. Ilus  Carter is married and still lives in father  and Shuah soon they were  well, they want you to come there when you return home - sister Mary fails.  Sister daughter 13 days older than our little,  Willford Owen, which I  suppose you have heard of long since for I wrote a  letter to you before I was confined but reserved a space in it to give you the news  and kept it by me untill after my confinement then immediately had it finis hed and sent it to the office I there gave you an account of my situa tion but lest you have not received it I will say that I may had a  fine son on the 22nd of March whome I call Willford for his long absent  father he was taken with the hooping cough when 5 weeks old but has got over it  now and grows finely it is said that he resembles his mother much.  Sarah Emma grows f^i^nely is backward about talking but says many words  calls poor, pa,pa, and prety pa pa many times in a day, she calls the babe pretty  boy and pretty Willo, she runs out of doors to play much of the time, and is as busy as  you ever saw a little one, she and Willford wrote to their papa in the letter that I sent ENDENTRY by brother Hyde - they are much company - for me wish you could see them a while I kiss them every day for their pa. My dear Willford did you know that 11 long months has passed away and you have not said one word about comeing home in your letters - is seames almost an age, do tell me something about it in your next letter - may the will of the Lord be done but I hope that it will be to send you home this fall is not pray the Lord that I may  have patience and grace to bear it for it is all that I can be most more than I can bear, to think of spending another cold long winter with out you - If you could send the children some red flannel for winter it would be verry acceptable - and my every day clothes are getting quite poor as I have been out of health ever since you left home but am quite smart now have not had a chill for 3 weeks - will you not bring your son a cap when you come home, however I suppose that you do not have much meanes to do with we are poor but how can we help, it if it could be your privilege to stay at home and we both labour hard I should think litely of it for the sake of your society - but to be poor and alone too is rather hard. and no prospect of its being different is rather discourageing is it not Willford. - Brother Joseph says that it is the elders privilege to spend half of their time with their families will you not remember that Willford. If you do not I shall be apt to remind you of it. - I suppose that you will remember it much as you did staying at home 3 yeares after we were married - I think if you do not stay at home home a while the next time you come we will put on the big pot and all go for I am quite tired of liveing alone - perhapes you may think that I have got to scolding but you knowe me and therefore must not mind small things. Brother Taylor has sent for Liverpool without delay but brother Joseph thought it not wisdom for her to go therefore she has given it up. I heard page torn br he said that he and England next season page torn gather page torn the saints and the work would be finised there also that tpage torn would page torn begin to behead the saints within 2 years in England, page torn Joseph page torn has been advanceing new things to the church and publick page torn late says that this earth was the largest ^panat planet^ that ever was made and that there has been parts taken from it several times and at the time the 10 tribes were lost there was a part taken from it and that that they would all come back and be joined to it again and that would be the realing to and fro like a drunken man  andc andc There has been some strange things taking place here of late 2 weeks since there was 2 horses seen to cross the Missisipi river one red and the other white, the red one landed about opposite Josep’s house the other went father down, it was seen by 4 persons in a boat crossing the river they were so near that they could see the water slop under their feet and distinguish the colour of the cloths that the rider's had on - when the red horse moved his tail there would be fire fly from it. and Joseph Sidney and Hiram ^have^ gone to Quincy to hold a debate with the Governor and a presbeterian minister have not heard the result. I suppose that you  have learned the defeat of the brethren at Robinson to^ld^ me he sent them to you. I hear that 10 of the 70 are about starting for England, I should think you would need assistance according to your preaching places; brother Bates Nobles was to go somewhere on a mission it would do him good. - It is not so sickly in Montrose or Commerce yet as last season. Please give my respects to the brethren and tell them that went with you that I have lately seen sister Taylor Hadlock. they were well and their families. Dear Willford I want to see you so much but I believe that I can say upon serious reflection that I have not wished you back once untill you have filled your mission although I have had many trials since you left but I find God to be my friend, I feel your absence to be a greate privation and sacrifice for me to make but I hope and trust that you will be the means of doing much good and fill you mis sion in the love and fear of God as soon as possible and come home to me and our little ones as soon as possible with the smiles of heaven resting on you.

The 6th of April there was a conference held in Commerce which continued nearly a week there was upwards of 70 baptized and ordained Elders and the church made their appe- al to heaven for redress of their wrongs and much business was transacted during the meeting. Brothers Page and N. Y. and then procede on brother Hyde has a letter for you as I thought he was going direct to England hope that you will get it for I wrote about many things in it— the work is rolling on here with rapi- dity in this country as much so and more than it ever has since the foundation of the church.  There has been an Indian and his wife and daughte baptized in Commerce a few days since they came some hundreds of miles to become acquainted with the work they believed and embraced it joyfu- lly they said every word of the book of mormon was true – he was an enterpreter to six tribes. and he said that every one of his brethren would receive it he knew it would be so – two Elder with their families (brother Emmit) have gone out among the Indians on a mission. Doctor Gallund has returned from his mission I think he started just before you left Montrose and has brought 60 families with him and expects it is said 200 families more soon. I have lately received a letter from Dwite Webster he is now at my house and has been here about a week I expect to go this afternoon to brother settlement ^with him^ he appears to be a worthy brother.

ENDENTRY I do not know as you can find out this letter for I have to write it mostly with my babe in my armes and little Sarah around me – she calls aloud for pa-pa many times in a day but the poor child has no pa to hear her. she is quite lonely like myselfe can you not tell me some thing near when you shall y come home I shall look for you in the fall. I have written you three letters before this since you left this continent and d^i^rected them to Preston, Lankinshire, Eng. and received 2 from you one dated Jan. 12th the other 27th - I should have written you oftener but my circumstances would not admit of it – it was not for the want of fealing or anx iety about you for believe me the society of no friends can fill the place of Willford in my heart for I feal verry lonely of times Yes the briny flood will oft times overflow its banks in spite of all my endeavours to restrain it but I know that it is the will of God that my compan ion should labour in the vineyard of the Lord therefore I have tried to be reconciled to the will of God in all things – I have not been left to murmer or complain once since you left me but am looking forward to the day when you shall return home once more haveing filled your mission in the love and fear of God.

I am now at father Clark’s whome I mentioned in my other letter am living by myselfe and think of staying here untill fall they are verry kind to me. I have a girl with me that works for me a part of the time and for herselfe some – paper damaged got along quite comfortable since I came to father Clarks for help food and raiment paper damaged requested me to tell you particulars I would say that my cow has not yet come in paper damaged the calfe you left with me I kept it (although they were not much pleased with it in brother neighbourhood) because you desired me to before you left I have 2 hens and 12 chickens they compose my stock at present. I hear that brother Joseph is expecting to have some houses built in Commerce for the families of the 12 Commerce is building up surprizeingly – the emigration there is said to be much greater than it ever was in Caldwell County, and the work is rolling on in America with much rapidity – am glad to hear of its progress in England – pitty the poor people in Eng. – I hope the saints will be patient and weight untill the Lord delivers them which he will do in his own time and way. I suppose that you get the times and seasons as the Editors said they sent each of the 12 a paper and by them you will learn of our brethrens success at Congress and many other things perhapse more correctly than I could inform you. Bishop Partridge has lately lost Tennesse whome you used to be acquainted there came to lovely street stoped a while then returned to his family and lived but 4 days afterwards. Sister Kimbal is troubled some with the ague and I have it every little while. We have lately heard that there has been a battle fought in Maine between the British and Americans about the boundary line and the Governors son was killed how it will end I know not – the British requested the Americans to give up the disputed land forth with but they refuse to do it therefore they are fulfilling the prophecies ancient and modern. We have heard of no accident happening to N. Orleans – there has been much destruction of the shipping in this country the past winter and spring – think it must have surp rized the people much to have seen that light and the earth rise as you mentioned in your letter. Stephen have a standing with the 70 seventies – brother Stephen is expecting to go out on a mission this season – his mother is expected here this sea son – she that was Brother and sister Ames have sent for me to come and stay with them untill you return they live about 60 miles from Commerce – Volentine has as much as he can do to get along with his family – lives on the Mulliner is very believing yet in this work and it is thought that he will be baptized – brother Hale talks of going on to Sarah Milliken will marry a man ENDENTRY out the church. Lest you may not get my letters I would just say that brother Ilus is married and sister Rhoda Scammans has a young Luther wants to come to the west but sister R does not. Did you know of the correspondence between brother Eunice I knew nothing of it untill he came here Mother Woodruff hinted someting of the kind in her letter and Eunice sent me word to receive him as a particular friend of her's. and then brother Webster told me of it himselfe he expects to take on himselfe the yoke of matrim ony with sister Eunice a soon after his return from this mission. I think that he will make an agreeable companion. he is a pleasant man and has an enquiring mind and seames to gain much faith and strength by converseing and becomeing acquainted with the brethren I think after he gets some more experience he will make a verry useful man. Washington. suppose he is on his way. has been verry sick on the way. The brethren are about trying to redeem Kirtland those who hold claim on it will take land in canada and the church here will give them land here for their possessions in canada I have lately heard that one brother Stodard formerly from there was going back to see them about it. I often think that I should like to be with you a  while and see how are getting along. If you could look over here in a rolling prairie near the timber into a little small house with one door in it you might see me verry often paper torning my little Sarah clinging on to the rocker of my chair so that paper tornmay rock a little with us singing pa-pa  ma-ma and bilo paper tornboy or Willo as she calls him.— I find my little ones are much company fopaper torn I had almost forgotten to tell you that we heard that the Indan’s had been into two counties in Missourie and made them pay them taxes on the land. it is said that the Misso urians fear the Indians much. Mr. Bogart the capt. of the Missourie mob shot a man their election day and he lived but a few hours. has had his trial and is to be hung the 4th of next july. thus I suppose his career will be ended for this life.  Many of the brother are fearful of the Indian’s comeing on Montrose side of the river and killing them but I feal verry easey about it myselfe although I have no Willford to look out for me. I believe my trust is in the Lord and I think that he will protect me. 24th Saturday eve. our family are in comfortable health and tomorrow I expect to go to brother Joseph preach on the resurrection brother Taylor wherein he says that you baptize 32 persons one week and 13 of them were methodist preachers. glad to hear of your success.

Webster she writes verry plain  to me on the subject— says she feels as though she was writing to a sister.  She says uncle Ozem will probably move west in the course of a year or two— she  appears strong in the faith.  2nd I have just this minute heard of an opportunity of sending  to you safely I therefore leave my breakfast partly eaten and  commence to write a little more in my letter thinking that  apart of a sheet will be better than none ^to you^ if your feelings are  like mine in regard to hearing from you— my health and  Willford Owen’s is good this morn. I dont know as you like  the addition of Owen to his name but sister Smoot much desired  it. I told you in my last letter which I mailed about  ten days since that I would send you the minutes of the  conference in it but as I have not got them and suppose that  brother Thompson will send them I defer it. I have not  received the papers from you should be much pleased to—  We have just received the Sept. paper it contains the most  of one of your letters and little Sarah death in it and I hope you  will get it by the bearer of this.

Ah! Sarah’s gone—Dear Babe—Her journey’s ore!  She breathe'd— she wept.— but she shall weep no more.  How short her time by providence assigned!  About 2 years she was on earth confine'd!  Angelic bands her spirit did convey,  To happier realmes in everlasting day: Our lovely child has first arrived at home,  to see the splendor of the eternal throne.  And shout us welcome to the promised land.  Our Sarah—Lovely Babe—Her infant frame,  No more shall feel the smart of mortal pain, She only sleeps! Though motionless she lies. Her sacred dust, refined, again shall rise,  to shine in bliss most exquisitly bright,  Surpassing far the sun’s refulgent light.  And is she dead? O no! She entered life  the moment she escaped this world of strife: She’s now from earth removed, her soul expands,  And by the throne in holy rapture stands;  Expanding still, she drinks the blissful streames,  And basks unsully' delighted, in unsully’d beames; Now hears with wonder the melodious strain,  And joins to celebrate Mesiah’s name;  Her mind illumined now with glad surprise,  Sees happier worlds, unseen from mortal eyes.  She now perhaps ^from^ Zion’s hight sublime  Looks down and views the simple things of time;  Or, if permited, to the earth descends,  And gladly mingles with her earthly friends;  Although unsee her happy spirit near, May hear the sigh, and see the falling tear,  May with concern behold maternal grief,  And fondly wish to sooth and give relief.  On the 15th I received another letter  dated july 8th, which also bore pleasing inteligence of your  health and prosperity and  also of the brethren with you.  The friends flock around to hear  your letters and seam much inter ested in them. I send them to  Joseph to read as he wants to  see them. Perhapse you may  think that I have forgotten to  tell you anything about our little  Willford Owen, O no, for he is now  in my lap pulling and scratching  round so that I can hardly write.  he has just ^torn^ up the almenack before  I saw what he was doing, he grows  finely considering the sickness he has  had, has been sick much of the time  since he was born, he has the chills and  fever now. He is now reaching  and trying to get my pen I will  give it him and see what he  will write. Dear pa pa do come  home and see me I want to see you  Dear wants to see you to, she often  cries about it. W. O. Woodruff.  Thus he has written some to his  pa pa himself they say the it is  said that fools and children tell  the truth— Enough of this.—  I have thought of not writing to you  any more for two reasons one is  I fear that you will not get them  and another is I heard that our letters  were oppened before you get them by a set of men, but I trust your good sense will  cause you not to have my weak letters exposed for they are designed for no eye but yours.  I have received all the letters you mentioned haveing written and they have affor- ded me much satisfaction, and sometimes I get quite lonely and disconsolat then the reception of  a letter cheers me up and I live hopeing that the time will come that you may be retu- rned home once more, this is the 8th letter I have sent you since you have been in  N.Y. I regret verry much that you do not get more of them. My health is comfortably good— I was verry glad yours was so  good. We hear that brother P. P. Pratt has taken his family to Eng. But brother Joseph does  not approve of it I hear.  When I commenced this letter I thought I would keep  a little kind of a journal untill after the conference on the 2nd of Oct. I attended the con ference though from the beginning I will give you some items of it as my mem ory serves me and in my next letter will coppy the minutes as you do not get the papers  should have done so now but Brother R Thompson had not got them made out  yet— The unclear conference commence was appointed the 2nd of Oct but in consequence  of bad weather they did not meet 3rd to-day there was a large assembly many brethren ENDENTRY came from a distance, we had a address from our prophet after which it was  voted that Kirtland should be built up and three ^one^ man was appointed to preside  over it I think they ^it^ was brother Higby  —then it was motioned that a committee be appointed and commissioned to  appoint and lay up stakes for the gathering ^from Lyman Whight  and Judge Higby were chosen— then they proposed building the Lord's  house by tytheing the people they commen^ce^ to collect materials this fall and begin to  build next spring— the people meet togather and work every tenth day  br. R. Cayhoon H. Smith and one more were appointed for the committee – the house  is to 100 feet by 120 and much other business was done the meeting closed  by an address from Dr. Bennet (a quarter master general who has lately been  baptized) upon the subject of war. And by his talk you wo^u^ld conclude they that the brethren expected war with Missourie sometime – he is a great orator.  4 th Sun. meeting commenced to day at 9 oclock and it was judged that  there was 5000 people on the ground. I shall not particularize the business of  this day or the morrow for my babe was quite troublesom which took my at tention much, 5th. brother Joseph was expected to preach today on the Priest hood but his health would not admit of it so A. Babbit took the stand and  delivered an interesting discourse upon the same subject.— yesterday brother Joseph spoke  a short time from ##1 Corinthians 15:29|29## verse of the 15 chap. of first Cor. of which I will here after speak and this afternoon brother L. White spoke on the same subject which was very interes ting. To-day we hear that brother Turly and his company are within 2 or three days  journey of here, and I stopped a week, to see them expecting to hear from you by then  spent most of the time with sister Kimbal she sends her respects to you—  She and family are well likewise sister Young She was not verry  well but was getting better, Vilate have been sick but are better— sister  Turleys family's also  sister Woodruff is comfortably as to health but her babe is not well. It has got now to be  the 15th of the month and brother Turley has not yet arrived here – I see my subjects and  sentences are verry broken but if you knew how I have to write you would not think  it strange, for I often have to leave my pen every minute and take the babe ^and^ but have to  write with him in my lap so that I make but poor headway about this business,—  although my sentences are more broken and disconnected than they otherwise would  by reason of my little son, I do not consider it any task to take care of him and  presume you will excuse me for these reasons and to ask the Lord to spare him for  future usefulness and for a comfort to his parents.— I feel that without my babe I  should be miserable indeed – yes much more lonely than at now - you cannot think how much I miss little Sarah Emma her death has disarmed me of all courage faith and  fortitude, I have had almost one scene of trouble since you left me by sickness andc but  I ^feel^ as though they were all light afflictions when compared with that – O pray for  me Willford that I may have grace and strength equal to my day - for I feel like a  lonely child on the earth now but I endure it as for Christ sake knowing that nothing  but a sense of duty to our heavenly ^father^ would cause us to part with the enjoyment of each of  each others society; but I will try to be patient and take as good care of our little lad as I can untill you return, which I pray God may be soon, for it seames that you  have been gone an age,—  Only ^think^ most 15 months, do tell me something about when  you think of comeing HOME - Well I have wandered far from my subject the  conference, it hend 3 days and closed on the 5th (Monday) and I returned home after  spending a week in Commerce - We had a verry interesting conference and often did I  wish that Yo you and your quorum could have the privilege of being there. 16th today I hear that the brethren have commenced to draw stone for the meetinghouse. Now a few  words from Brother Joseph sermon on the living’s being baptized for the dead that they  may be judged according to men in the flesh; he has learned by revelation that those in  this church may be baptized for any of their relatives who are dead and had not a  privalege privaledge of hearing it this gospel even for their children, parents, bothers, sisters,  grandparents, uncles, and aunts,— but not for acquaintances unless they send a mi nistering spirit to their friends on earth,— as soon as they are baptized for their  friends they are released from prison and they can claim them in the resurrection and bring them into the celestial kingdom— this doctrin is cord^i^ally received by the church  and they are going forward in multitudes, some are going to be baptized as many as  16 times— they have to be baptized and confirmed separately for every friend— once  in one day— How many can a spirit be baptized wh— why not deputize a friend on earth  to do it for them— John Wesly can receive this work but how can his spirit be  baptize in water— It is the privilege of the oldest one in a family to be baptized  for their friends if they desire it but they can give it to another if they choose  Brother Joseph makes this doctrin look verry plain and consisten— he  has been bringing strange things forward to the church this season— strong  meat— he has delivered a course of lectures this season which were verry  interesting— I could not attend only apart of the time but often wished you  could be present—  he says that the throne of God stands on the earth like this earth  only it is cleansed andc andc— says that this earth is the wickedest planate that ever God made  and that its inhabitants are will have the greatest glory if they overcome evil— and  that it was the largest when made but at different times there has been parts  taken from it, for instance when the ten tribes were lost and says they will ENDENTRY all be restored again.— brother Joseph says that he actually  died and was raised to life again— says the beasts that he fought with at Epesus often  killed him and he came to life again— if so Willford why may not our little  Sarah be raised to life again— He, brother Joseph has brought forth many new  things this season.— There has been quite a number of deaths in Commerce  the past season I believed that I mentioned some of them in my last  letter to you Seymour Brunson, he was buried under armes— bishop he said that  brother D. Patten was calling him and desired brother Joseph to let him go for  he needed him— likewise bishop wife is married again to  Mother Beanam— father John Jo  Joseph Smith the patriarch a little previous to his death he called his children around  him and blessed them and appointed Hiram Patriarch in his stead— There are  many things I have mentioned in my other letters to you which would be  interesting to you which I could mention if you have not received them.  such as some of the brethren’s going among the Indians, I saw two of them  on the 2nd of this month and they said the prospects were good - last April  there was an Indian his wife and daughter baptized in Commerce.— I have  not heard from Connecticut since I wrote you last. - Did you  know that Dwite Webster  came here in june and went to the south with brother Smoot and  expects to spend the winter in Ten. brother Smoot has ordained him an  elder and given him charge over the churches there, he makes great pro ficiency in the ministry— brother Smoot has got home and with his wife sends  his respects to you Sister Smoot says to tell brother Woodruff not to forget my hymn book  and while you are thinking of hers remember that I have no hymn book or bible.  Brother fox islands  with some other elders and there has been quite a stir among the people there again  and there has about as many come into the church lately us when you was  there— sister Jane Herrett say give my respects to br Woodruff I have lately had  a letter from her— I have lately seen sister Bently she that ^was^ sister Pattin she says  give my love to brother Woodruff and tell him he knows that I love him with  all my hart, her health is poor and she desires the prayrs of all that quorum  that it may not turn with her as it did with brother wife in her  last day but that she may be spared through it and do good on the earth she wants that little portrait of brother Pattins which you have as she has none  I page torn you to get your portrait painted if you can conveniently— apage torn if you page torn can get me a wrought black lace veil I should like it much and page torn cape and collar I should be much pleased as they come much cheaper thepage torn  here. The families of the 12 have rather snug times to get along here— brother  Kimball was a wise man to build his house and get his family into it before he  left them. I have seen Eng I  have forgotten her name they were from Preston they have seen you all.  I was glad to see them. I read some of your letters to them they were  much pleased with them. Please give my respects to brother Kimbal and  all the quorum that are there likewise all the saints around you.  19th Yesterday Sunday, we had an interesting sermon we had an interesting subjec upon the living's being baptized for the dead it was made so plain that none  could dispute it reasonably and I should be glad to be baptized for my grandparents  and some others but want to wait for you to do it would it not be best, I had ra ther you would do it than any person living.— Sister Swasey one of my good  neighbours sends her respects to you and says tell brother Woodruff that she wants  him to come home for my sake. I am now at father Clarks and think I shall  stay here untill you come home. I am comfortable here and if I want any thing  can call on brother William Clark who wrote to you in my other letter makeing  a covenant with you that he would supply my needs and wants untill you  come home, He is a fine young man— belongs to the 70s and is father Clarks oldest  son at home he know you and says he is some acquainted with you— therefore  give yourselfe no uneasiness about my temporal wants but give me and our  babe an interest in your prayrs. I fell anxious to see my presents you spoke of  in your last letter— Ah! what shall I do when those little shoes come for Sarah  I don’t know sometimes how to bear her loss it seames as though I cannot endure  it, but I must stop for it seems line a neverending subject for me to speak or  write on. Sister Kimbal received some very pretty presents I saw  them when I was there they (like me) thought much of them; more on account  of their comeing from their husbands – If you could get some articles of clothing for  your family it would be quite acceptable— the sister who gave you the bed in N. Y. apostatized in about 2 weeks after so sister Stone told me from N. Y. Sarah  Milliken is not married yet but expects to be to a man out of the Church she  is in Commerce.— Aphia Woodman has sent a letter to Sarah Milliken asking  her advice and mine about coming west with Milton she is about 60 miles east of  father Carters with her brother - Milton has lately sent here to know who of the  brethren are going to Eng. this fall and when they will be in N.Y. so it appears that  he is thinking of going but there are none who are thinking of going from here this  fall, I hear that brother Joseph dont think it is best for them to go.

I let brother Smoots 8 days after you left then she came home well and fleshy and bright she continued well about 2 weeks and then I was taken with the fever and ague 3 or 4 days before she was. we were then in Montrose and no one to do any thing for us as they were all sick about there so that brother and sister Smoot came out and mooved us to their house and rendered us every assistanc they could although their house was unfinished yet our accommodations were much better than in Montrose. we have been quite low having had a shake every day but are both getti ng better now. I was much rejoiced to hear of the improvement of your health after you left by a man who saw ^you^ about 40 miles from here who said that you requested him to call and see me. I was glad to hear from you any way. much wonder that you do not write as you have always done before I think that you have not time or the letter has miscaried or something has happened. so good night my Willford hopeing that I shall feel better in the morn. The morn has come and found me for the first time without a chill or shake although I feal verry weak yet I think that I am gaining health and Sarah to. The men have come to day to raise my house I am in hopes that they will get it finished by the time that I am able to go into it their has been some talk of sister Tailor’s going in with me as she had to move out of brother Youngs house she went into my room with sister Pratt while I am out here. Sister Taylor wants to come out into this neighbourhood she is a good neighbour. but the family you left with me Oh! dear! if I had expected the time had been long that I  should have dwealt there I should have sent for you to have come home for I could not have staid in the house with any contentment— but thank the Lord I have not for the frirst moment wished you at home since you left but desired and prayed for your spead and success on your mission, Yea that you might have strength both temporal and spi ritual wisdom grace knowledge humility and understanding to pres erve you from all evil and help you fill your mission in the love and fear of God and have many souls as seals of your ministry  I hope to do better next time   ENDENTRY Yes I even begin to look forth for the day when I hope and trust that I shall behold and embrace him whom I now feal to dedicate to the Lord know ing his calling although it I think it the greatest sacrafice that I could make to be deprived of the society and company of my nearest friend on earth but I think that the grace of God is sufficient for all things even to raise me from a bed of sickness and preserve me ^and Sarah^ untill thy return which is my sincere desire. Oh! Willford do not forget ^us^ when at the throne of grace for we need as much grace to stand at this time of trial there are not enough well people in Montrose to take care of the sick therefore they suffer for want of attention—much the same in Commerce although some have died there—and none in Montrose save a number of children brother Pratts was one of the number— well when you left. There have about 53 of the brethren died in Quincy and it continues verry sickly there yet— brother Lane has lost both of his children. brother wife is dead some of your Southern acquaintance—brother Jeremiah Murphy has been here from Tennessee and wishes to be rem^e^mbered to you. I suppose that you have learned the fate of our Island friends as I heared that you went through Rochester was glad that you had an oppertunity of seeing them. I received a book of brother Springfield with your marke or my name on it. was glad even to see that I received a letter from home the day that you left home. the^i^r heath was generally good accept sister Foss who was quite feeble and had been for 2 months in consequence of lifting the old gentleman who lived with her in his last illness he died last April. they sent much love to you and the letter was d^i^rected to you. they much wished you ^to^ called and see brother N.Y. they feared that you would not know that he was there. did not know that we had a paper from him. they wanted me to come home and stay with them while you was gone. they wanted you to call there on your return from England— Sister Foss would be much pleased with a letter from you. do write me once a month for they will seam long. I found the last page in your journal and read it with interest. hope that you found a lock of my hair with some lines in your trunk. Sarah sends a lock of her hair to you with a kiss by kissing the letter. Shshe often calls pa-pa-pa- verry loud—dont you hear her. If you have an oppertunity to get some wooling undershirts they would be much better for you. I have been weighting to receive a a letter from you before I wrote but feared if I weighted longer you would not get it before you left N.Y. ENDENTRY I verry much covet the long time that you have to journey before you get to N.Y. wish you could have spent the time at home. I would have written you a few of my sick bed reflections but do not feal able. Sister Smoot and brother Smoot have shown us every kindness in every kindness in their power. Sister Taylor and and her little girl are quite sick. Please give my best respects to brother Tailor. I know that this writing is verry bad but I think that you will excuse it when you learn that it was all written on my knee in the bed not being able to sit up. I shall give up the remainder of this sheet to brother Smoot not being able to fill it myself. With much love I remain yours Willford Woodruff Phebe W.

I was truly glad that you recei ved that letter you spoke of that I sent you in march for I conclude you must feell verry an^x^ious to hear from home judging you by myselfe for if I do not get a letter from you of ten I get quite uneasey — this is the 7th letter I have sent you since you left N N.Y. I have taken much pains to write you since you left home and much lament that you have  not received my letters, for I have written them verry full and one was a long sheet like your mamoth sheet-filled full, I wrote you once in Jan. then in Mar. then in Apr. then  in May then June then July then this in Sept — the April letter I sent by brother O. Hyde  and J. E. Page, who who started soon after the April conference on a mission to the ^Jews^ via of Eng and the one in july I sent by brother Sarah Emma death he expected to go d^i^rect to Eng. and I hope you have received that one this time, one I directed to you in J. Taylor thinking you would be more  likely to get it. You say you have sent me 4 letters since you arrived in Eng. I  have received them all and they brought much news, and afforded me and others much satisfaction for all the brethren and sisters seam anxious to hear from Eng. and I with them rejoice with you much in the prosperity of the work with you and that the Lord is  blessing you labours and the brethren’s there - The work rolls on there swiftly but the  time of your absence seames long to me it is 13 months today since I last saw you and it seames  to me to be almost an age but I will try to wait patiently your return which I know will be as soon  as the Lord^’s will^ is done with you there and did I not know that the Lord required you to be in his vine yard I could not endure your absence but the Lord has promised strength equal to our day  and I find he has fulfilled that promis to me, for I have been enabled the most of the time to be contented and reconciled to my situation although I have had much sickness and a  severe trial to pass through in looseing my little Sarah even in the absence of her father the little  dear had no relatives to follow her to her grave but her mother and little brother whome she tenderly loved, she d there was quite a number of the brethren and sisters accompanyed me but it was a peculiar trying scene for me, more so because of your absence she did not forget her pa,pa,  for she used to call him many times in a day, but I trust she rests from the toils and  troubles of this life. I have not heard from father Woodruffs house hold for sometime, but lately learned by a letter from br.

I think him to be a fine man and will make a worthy companion  he wrote some in a letter that I was writing to you when he was here.  The siskness in Montrose and Commerce is not so greate as it was last season but there has quite a number died this season some of which I know Seymour Brunson,  widow daughter, Joseph Smith are verry low, and many others that I do not know I had our little Sarah buried in Commerc and have got a picket fence around it ^her grave^ painted white and trimed with black — I miss her company much.

My Dear Phebe  I again appropriate a little time to fill a sheet to you. which I shall mostly take up in giving an account of the work of the Lord in this Country. I wrote you a long letter while in potteries, but whether it has fallen into your hands or not I do not know. You have been anxious No doubt to hear from me from time to time, and I have been equally as anxious to hear from you, but I do hope that you have not been as much disappointed in your desires in this thing as I have in mine for though I have written to you as often as once a month since I left home, yet I have not seen the first mark of your pen but once since I last saw you, and then you and Sarah was both sick in bed and you must realize that my desire has been vary great to hear from you Sisters Turley and Clark both wrote to their husbands and their letters arivd safe and I was in hopes to have herd a word about you some way but in this I was also disappointed, I do not make these remarks wishing to cast any reflections at all for I presume you have written several Letters to me since I left home but they must have been lost by the way somewhere. But I want you still to continue to write to me often for I may obtain some of them. I want to hear from you and little Sarah vary much. I continued Labouring in Staffordshire about the Potteries untill the first of March when I left the church in that place in the care of Elder Turley numbering nearly one hundred and I went into the South part of England about 80 miles from the Potteries or whare the word had been preached at all and I made a stand near Ledbury in Herefordshire. it is about 40 miles from Wales, I commenced Working and the Lord worked with me in a wonderful manner I first stoped at Mr John Benbows a large farmer he was cultivating 5 or 600 acres of Land. his Brother William Benbow went from the potteries with me to his Brothrs I expect you will soon see him in Montrose for he has gone to America and will call upon you. I arivd at John Benbows on the 5th of March I preached at his house on the 5th and was convinced that their was many that would come into the church I also preached on the 6th and Baptzed 6 persons 4 of which were preachers of the United Brethren of the Methodist order, John Benbow and wife were baptized I preached on the 8th and Baptzd  7. 4 were preachers 9th I Prechd and Baptzed 7, 2 were preachers 10th I Baptzd 12 three were preachers 13th I Baptzd 3. 16th I Baptzd 3 20th I Baptzd 3 one a preacher 21 I Bap 4, two preachers 23d I Bap 12 one a preacher 24th I Baptzed 9. four were preachers 27th I Baptzed 7 four were preachers 28 I Baptzd 2 one a Methodist preacher 29 I Baptzd 13. several were preachers 30 I Baptzd 9, five were preachers 31st I Baptzd 13, four were preachers April 2d I Baptized 9, two were preachers 4th I Baptzd 11 women 5 I Baptzed 9 three were preachers 6th I Baptzed 5. one preacher and one Clark of the Church of England 8th I Bap 7 four were preachers 9th I Baptzed 5 in the midst of a shower of stones tha fell upon me from a mob 10th I Baptzed several persons  After labouring here one Month I receivid a letter from Elder Liverpool stating that the Twelve had just arivd from New York and I must come immediately and meet with them in conference at Preston and so I left this part of the vineyard and travled 160  miles to Preston and attended a conference with the 12 and the church in general  and had an interesting time. I was truly happy to meet our Brethren from America and immediately after the conference I returned accompaned by Elder  W. Richards will soon join us in this vast field that  is now open before us I never have seen such a vast field for labour as the Lord has enabled me to open where I now am since the church was first established either in America or England. I preached here one month and 5 days and baptized the superintendant of the Church of the United Brethren and about 45 Preachers of the same order with about 120 of the members making about 160 in all, and this senery has flung into my hands or under my care and superintendancy more than forty esstablished places of preaching which are licensed according to Law including one or two chapels and their is now about 200 ready to be baptized as soon as an opportunity offers I have Baptized some   here of most classes rich as well as poor. a Number of large farmers I have Baptized from 8 to 13 the first time I have preachd in several places The Lord of Hosts has been with me and much of the convinceing spirit of God has accompaned the word. The whole country was immediately stired up. the Ministers was of England of the Church of England I was inf ormed held a council upon the subject to stop me in my preaching and also the work one of the Church Ministers called upon the constable of the parish to take me up but he called upon the wrong man for he had recievd my testimony and I had baptzed him. but as they cannot stop me by either the Law of the Land or the word of God, I have been ind. they offer to Baptize those of their own church if they desire it this is done thinking to save them from joining us for I have baptized a number of their ^members^ churches. I have had vast congregation out to my meeting both priest and people. their will spedily be a mighty work in this country I think there ENDENTRY will be several hundred Baptzed soon in this part of the vineyard there is now nearly 200 sants here and the work if but just begun to human appearance Elders Richards, and myself will continued in this part of the vineyard untill we have secured the grain which is ripe for the harvest the work is rooling rolling on in every part of England where the word is faithfully proclamd we have sent the Minutes of our Conferene to the Editors of the Times and Seasons and you will see by that, that we are about to publish a Hymn Book and also a Monthly periodical Elder Manchester which will be his place of abode for the present, Edinburg the capital of Wright have Baptized about 40 in Scotland. Heber C. Kimble is well and will visit the churches which he has formerly built up and then thinks some of going to Herefordshire, Hadlock is well and going to the North of England Eldr Clark is well not well but he has had a few shakes of the fever and ague but is getting better. Eldr Turly is well as to health but last I herd from him he was preaching to the spirits in prison for he has been confined in Birmingham under pretene of Debt but it was to stop him from preaching, as soon as I herd of it I went to see him and carried him some provisions and money so that he should not suffer. he has friends now that are administering unto him so he has what he needs I expect he will soon be liberated he is preaching to the prisoners and some want to be Baptzed I saw two men hung at the gaol the day I went to visit him. Elder Tayler is well and has just recievd a letter from Sister Tayler which said that you was well and I was exceding glad to hear it I do not know when the Letter was dated but I Believe in Janowary Jan I have not had a letter from any friends in America since I arived in Sarah Foss and William Benbow Left Liverpool a few day since for commerce I did not know that he was going so soon I had no chance to see him before he went if he I had I should have sent some letters by him to you and some other small articles their is much of the spirit of gathering with the Saints in this Land John Benbow has sold his property to the amount of about £1,500 and wants to go as soon as the Lord will. I have had some scenes here some like ancient times soon after I commencd preeching in Ledbury or Herefordshire the Sound spedily went abroad and thee Ministers or preahers came more then 20 miles in a gig to see me and inquire into thes things they never had herd me preach or any of our people and when they came to the house whare I was I had put on a change of clothing to go to the pool to baptzed a preacher that had baptized recevd my testimony I invited them into the room whare I was and I asked them what their business was with me. they said they had come to learn who I was and who had sent me and what message I had for them and the people. I then stood up and taught them Jesus Christ and the first principles of the gospel and testified of the Book of Mormon and the great work which God had set his hand to accomplish and while I was yet speaking the spirit of God rested upon us and bore testimony unto them of the truth of my words and they bowed down and prayed and gave glory to God for his marvelous work and they rose up and the Charriot stood still while all four of these preachers went down into the pool and I Baptzed them and lade my hands upon them and they recevd the Holy Ghost and went their way rejoiceing. I went into the town of Ledbury to preach for the first time and as soon as the people herd that I was in town they gathered together in companies wanting to hear, the Baptist Minister offered to open his Chapel for me and he went into the pulpit with me and opened the meeting by reading the 35 chapter of Isaiah and praying mightyly for the Lord to bless me and make me an instrument of doing much good after which I arose and preached to ENDENTRY the largest congregation (it was said) that ever met in the Chapel and they did not have over an hours notice many appeared Believing, the Baptists Minister gave me his hand and bid me God speed, aftr meeting I Baptized 13, ^next morning^ and the Lord is opening many doors upon the right and left. You will see from the England which were represented at our conferene sumwhare about 1800 in all nearly one half of which have been Baptized since Preston on the 6th of At July at which time I expect a large addition of Numbers, I have visit many parts of England since I arivd and in my travels I have visited many of the Ancient and Noted castles, and Cathedrals which are well worth the attention of a Historian or travler the most Noted one I have visited is the splended Ancient Cathedral standing in the City of Young was with me this Cathedral surpasses any thing for splendor and architecture mine eyes ever beheld it is about 500 feet in length parts of it about 150 in highth it was 8 or 900 years of age. it contained many Monuments and portraits of persons graven out of solid marble and lade over the tombs and vaults of Ancient Bishops, Lords, and Princes some of which have lane there for 7 or 800 years it is said that some of those monument with their winding sheets al of which are carved out of solid marble is as neatly executed as any thing found in Europe Almost every thing about it is carved out of solid fine marble. the whole pulpit with all its trimings and hangings and deorations is carved out of one solid stone. There is a large organ in the building and the church of England still worship there and hold a meeting twice every day in a year We stayed though one service. We also have been on to the top of Malvern Hill which is the most Noted Hill in England in consequene of it being the highest Hill in England and the most splended prospect of all the surround country for 30 miles and on some of the Highest peaks are large intrenchments whare men retreated to in the time of the Roman war The building in the village of Malvern are splended standing on the side of thes Hills it has long been a place of retreat for the Kings Queens Princes Lords and Nobleman of London and other parts of England.

When I take into consideration the day and generation in which we live even in this  last dispensation and fullness of times, the awful calamity that awaits the gentile Nations of the present age, The Allmighty work of God that is to be accomplised before  the Comeing of Christ, the esstablishing of Jerrusalem in her power, and Zion in her  glory, the pruning of the vineyard once more for the last tine, and form some small  view of those greater misteries and glories of the Celestial Kingdom which are not lawful to  be written and are yet to be revealed, and having a dispensation of the gospel committed unto  me in common with my Brethe which is ^to^ accomplish the great work of God which he has set has hand, ^to do^ I say when I comprehend these things I do not summon words that God has call us to make such great sacrafices in these last days, I now see the greater the sacrafice the greater the crown FIGURE The ancient Saints of God have been called  to make great sacrifices that they might comprehend a Selestial Glory, then if  we enjoy the same glory we are called to make a sacrafise also, and have we  not done it, yes verily we have equal to any people that ever lived according to the tine we have been a people, or church of Christ I cannot make a greater sacrafise than the society of my wife and family ^children^ but notwithstanding this sacrifice is of of the  keenest kind to my wife as well as myself yet does my Bosom friend in her heart ever for a moment wish me to scease doing the will of God, or in the least to tarnish our future and eternal glory, or to dim our crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord- Jesus No I will not for a moment believe it. Then my Dear friend and companion still  continue patient untill my return which will be as soon as is the will of God though we are seperated a few days here yet we shall reign and live together 1000 years with the children which God shall give us and also with our Lord Jesus Christ and  we shall also enjoy each other society in a Celestial Kingdom to part no more We now laying the foundation here of a great work even directly or indirectly among all the gentile Nations. M ^our^ present intention is to spend the winter in Europe and return to Commerce in the Spring it is a great voyage and journey from  England and as we are hear it appears to be wisdom and the will of God ENDENTRY that we should spend a few months more before we return, The work of the Lord is rolling on swiftly in this land and the present signs are that the gentiles will spedily be warned. Already are there thousands rejoiceing in the New and Everlasting Covenant  in England, the standard of truth as an ensign to the people is reared up in the largest cities of Scotland, and Saints rejoicing therein The warning voice is spedily to be heard in the City of Wales come and preach unto us  Already ^has^ ^has^ the fulness of the gospel started upon the wings of the wind and the Bellows of  the deep by the hand of an Elder of Israel to the east Indies, This vary day a gallant Ship  spreads her sail at William J. Barret enters as his Ark to convey him in safty to South Australia to proclaim the everlasting gospel to that far distat people Notwithstanding he is but 17th years of age he is clothed with the power of the Priesthood the revelations of Jesus Christ, of the spirit of his mission. Notwithstanding he has this  day left his native country and started on his voyage of 16000 10000 miles yet he is filled  with rejoicing and his soul is made glad, which is fully manifest in a letter which  has just reached us from his hand exhorting us to be faithful and pray for him  declairing in the name of God that he will return to Zion bringing his  sheaves with him, he has taken our addresses in England and president Joseph Smithjr in the U.S.A. and sayes he will write to him after he esstablises his mission. he was raised up in the church at Stafford Shire Potteries. Thus  you see the gospel is winging its way with the rapidity of lightning throu ghout the world. Thus you see by the help of God we are laying the foundation  of a mighty work throughout the European world and other Islands of  the Sea. We expect to spedily lift up the Standard in the City of London and visit France ^Millennial Star begins to dawn and we hope soon to behold the rising Sun Now in the time for us to prove ourselves, and work while the day Last lest night come when no man can work. and while the work is rolling on swiftly in foreign Nations I rejoice to hear of the progress of it in my own County esspecially this the seed of Israel in the western wiles have begun to receive the fulness of the gospel. I pray  my heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ to hasten the day when Ephraims Nobles will be of himself and his Governour procede out of the midst of him and Judah rejoice and Israel be made glad, and Judah Jerrusalem be rebuilt upon her own heaps,  and Zion become the joy of the whole Earth. Roll on O ye little stone cut out  of the mountain without hands. untill ye become a mountain and fill the whole the  whole Earth ENDENTRY O Lord let the fulness of thine everlasting gospel spedily go to all the gentile Nations when they count themselves unworthy of Eternal life may the law be  learned and testimony sealed in their midst that they be left without excuse May Israel spedily return and seak the Lord his God and thy goodness in the Latter day let the prayer of the widow and the cry of the orphan assend into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth let the Heavens witness their tears and record them on high untill the Allmighty shall come out of his hiding place and avenge those Widows and Orphans of the Spilt Blood  of their Martered husbands and fathers which was shed by the Iron hand of the Inhabitants  of Missouri for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. Let the Americ an Nation spedily learn that there is a God in Israel who holds the destinies  of all Nations and at whose command goes forth the Issues of life and Death. O  Lord cloth thy Saints with Salvation and thine elders with the power of God Let thy special witnesses be swift to the Nations of the Earth. Let council  wisdom and the fear of God rest upon them untill all thy purposes are accomplised concerning them which thou dost Deign to perform Give thy prophets wisdom means and power to esstablish Zion and her Stakes to be throne down no more forever  but to remain as an asylum and a place of refuge for the honest in page torn thee meek of the earth from the gathering storm which is about to fall page torn the heads of this generation.

I have  and shall have much that I would like to communicate to you from  time to time.  I am enjoying the best of health and spirits, and am happy;  and I never enjoyed myself better while in the vineyard of the Lord. and could  I Behold the faces of my wife and children often, it would greatly add to  my joy and consolation: But Knowing that we shall have our reward for  all the sacrafices that we are called to make in this life, for Christ sake, and  for all that we do in his cause and y Vineyard, causes me to be reconciled  to his will. I wrote a letter to Prsdt Joseph Smith, Jr. in company with  Elder T. Turley, June, 27th, In which I gave him a Brief accou nt of my labours in the vineyard.  We have held two conferences of late, in the  South of England where I have been labouring; the first was held at the W. Richards was with me, we had an inter esting time, we organized 12 churches, and transacted much business; the other  was held on the 21st of June, at Stanly Hill, Herefordshire, England. Elder Richards and myself  conducted the meeting, or conferene with the help of God. and I never saw more  business executed in one day, than on that occasion. We organized 20 churches, Ordained 4 Elders, 7 Priest, and 4 Teachers; Baptized 10, Confirmed 20, and Blessed 20 children,  besides a multitude of other business, and broke bread to several hundred Saints, andc.  The work had been so rapid, it was impossible to ascertain the exact No. belonging  to each branch, but the whole Number is 33 churches, 534 members, 75 officers, viz;  10 Elders, 52 Priest, 13 Teachers, all of which had imbraced the work in less time than ENDENTRY four months in a new field which I have opend in Westershire,  and Glostershire and the church now in that place numbers over 600, and the work  never in a more prosperous state in that place than at the present time:  I had no doubt but what the churches in that place will soon No. 1000 souls.  We have set all the churches in that region in Order,  ^with^ Officers members presiding  over them, and they are now Baptizing daily in that region, about 50 of those  Baptized, were preachers of different Orders. Between 3 and 400 hundred of which, I  have Baptized: and so you see the sacrafice which we are called to make, is not  in vain. I feel vary thankful to God for the manner he has blessed me in  my labours sine I have been in England. I also attended a conference  the Manchester, and had an interesting time.  I arivd in Manchester On the 1st day of July, and I spe^n^t 3 days with the Twelve,  and other friends in writing, transacting business, visiting the Saints, preparing for the confer ene, andc. and had a pleasant time. On Sunday the 5th of July, I met with the  Saints, and a large congregation of Citizens in the Joiners Hall in Manchester, for public  worship: this hall, the Saints have hired for their regular place of meeting, they  pay £100. (about $500) yearly; it will seat about 2000 souls; the rent is paid by  contribution. There was about 1000 persons present, I preached in the forenoon and  several testified in the Afternoon, while we were communig with about 400  Saints: the power of God was upon the people. Monday, July 6th the quorum  of the Twelve and a general conferene of the Church of L.D.S. sat in conferene  in Europe, met at the above namd place, and we had an interesting day; there  were Elders present from every almost evry church in England, and Scotland; there was abot ^about^  40 churches represented, containing 2,495 members, 59 Eldes, 122 Priests, 61 Teachers, 13 Deacons,  making an increase of about 824 members, 25 Elders, 70 priest, 23 Teachers, and 5 Deacons, during the last three months; and 374 members, 9 Elders, 50 Priests, and 13 Teachers of the above number, were  added in the Herefordshire churches in which ^where^ I had been labouring. But the foundation is  now la^i^de in such a manner in this country, and new Doors opening in England, Scotland,  Wales, so that we have evry reason to expect a greater increas for the months  to come, than has been in the thee that are past.  I pray God to roll on this work in  mighty power in this country and in all Nations and enable us to be humble in the  midst of prosperity, and work righteousness with all diligence while the day last, and learn learn that it is the mercy, and work of God that giveth us Souls as seals of our  ministry. July 8th the Elders are mostly leaving Manchestr to day for their missions abroad. ENDENTRY The Twelve are all well, also Clark excep Brothr Clark has had a little of the ague.)

June 3d ^1840^  My Dear Phebe, I take this method to inform you that on last Saturday night the 30th of May, just as I had retired to rest in company with Elder Richards at Br John Benbows. A Brother came into the room and informed us he had 6 letters for us. On opening them We found 2 from Sister Richards and an Elder. one from a Sister in Manchester. one from Montrose Dated March 8th and 22d and most of these letters was full of glad tidings so much so that it drove sleep from our eyes for the night. and we both felt more like going into the street and shouting Hallalujah than we did like being wraped in Sleep. You may rest assured it created no small degree of joy in my mind to receave a letter from your hand for it is the first word I have recieved from you and the ownly one since I saw you excepting one letter which I receved from you while in New York. I have not receved your letter spoken of the first of Jan. I feel thankful that you have receved my letters which I wrote you while in America, this is the fourth letter I have sent you since I have been in England which I hope you will get. I have also sent two letters to the Editors of the Times and Seasons. I have long been anxious to hear from you and know how you was getting along temperally and Spiritually. I feel to rejoice in the Blessing which God has given us, and that you have been so comfortable in your sickness and that God has opened a door whereby you have found some friends in a time of need. I also feel to rejoice to hear from little Willford. I pray the Lord to preserve them Blameless unto the comeing of the Lord Jesus Christ and use them for his own glory. and give them a place with their parents in Zion while Christ reigns. I have much upon my mind I wish to say to you much more than I can put upon this Sheat. But for the want of room I can ownly briefly hint at them. I sent you a letter a mamouth sheet filled full of Jan 30th and one April 24th I also wrote some in a letter that B. Young sent to his wife April 23d, On the 30th of April I received a letter from Farmington. Dated in Marh All was well there, I sent a Letter ^to^ M. Holmes to come to England. I have just got an answer all well in that region, but hard times. I have lately sent a full letter to Sister S. Foss. I wish you to write to me often and give me all the news, it is a great consolation to hear from my little family while I am seperated from them. You say you are at father Clarks and ask if it would not be best to stay there untill I come home, you say they make you free and welcome this being the case I would advise you to stay untill my return if you can feel at  Please kiss little Sarah E. and Willford for me I should be pleased to see you all much. I had as leave his name would be Willford as any thing, I like single names best, for boys) May the Lord bless him. I want him to grow as fast as he can and take turns with me in the vineyard by and by, so that I can be with you part of the time take good care of him and that I know you will do. you shall all have my prayers and Blessing and the Lord will bless you ENDENTRY home it will be so much less care and trouble than it will be to see to your own wood water andc. this is simply my present feeling upon the subject, Remember me with gratitude to Brother Clark. and tell him for me that if he feels willing to lend you the hand of assistance in this your time of need and let you tarry with him untill my return, that he shall not loose his reward and he shall have my prayers and Blessing and the Blessing of God shall rest upon him and his children, and his childrens children untill the latest generation, could I have the privilege of being with my own family I would not trouble any person with them, But a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me in common with my Brethren and required at our hands in consequence of which my family must be assisted by some one in time of need. and I say again in the name of Jesus Christ that that soul who does good to my wife or children while I am in the vineyard of the Lord doing his work shall be blessed of the Lord and no power shall take it from them, and I feel vary thankful to Brother Clark for his kind offer. Give my respects to the Brother Clarks Son, Remember me to L. Whight and family should you see them and all enquiring friends I rejoice to hear of the progress of the work in America and the prospect of the Saints being rewarded for their loss by the government. I was much pleased with your letter it contained much news. I gave you an account in my last letter of my opening a new field in the South part of Herefordshire, the work of the Lord has continued to roll on from the time I first commenced preaching in this part of the land untill the present time in a manner that I have never before seen it in these last days, it is not yet 3 months since I first lifted up my voice to preach to the people in this part of England a region which had not herd the sound of it before but now conta ins a Church of 500 Saints, with about 50 Elders and priests. about 50 of which  were preachers of the orders of the day, I have administered Baptism to about 300 of the Saints above spoken of, and Elders Richards and the Elders and priests which we have raised up in this Branch have Baptized the other 200, and the field which is opened here is so large and extensive that it seems as though the work had but just began here and I expect hundreds will be added to the Church here. It is rapidly opening doors in all the Surrounding country in the South of England and also in Wales we have Baptized some few in the Border of wales. We have this day receeved the first No of the Latter Day Saints P P Pratt at Manchester England. We shall soon have a collection of Hymns of at ^out^ of Press, and the Book of Mormon will soon be in tipe. The work is progressing rapidly in every part of England and Wright are doing well in Scotland. Jn Taylor is Baptizing in Liverpool. The American Brethen are well as far as I know Elder Turley is out of Prision, is well and preaching. We have a general conference to be held in Manchester on the 6th day of July next for the Elders of England, Scotland, and Wales I shall then expect to meet with all the quorum of the Twelve that are hear I have not yet herd from B.Young came down and spent 2 or 3 weeks with me and has gone back to Manchester to assist P P Pratt in printing. Elder Richard has left me this morning to visit the Border of Wales We Baptized a man confirmed and ordained him a priest. and he commenced Baptizing all in one day and next morning he started to carry the gospel to the Border of Wales and commenced Baptizing and Elder Richards has gone to assist him a few days. I have left orders for the Millennial Star to be sent to you ENDENTRY I trust you will get them. The Lord is about to do a great work in this Land it is beginning to progress like fire in a day Stubble We have wrote to the president of the Seventies to send us 20 of the quorum and also wrote for some High priest. Notwithstanding we have Baptized about 500 whare I am now labouring, yet it does not we are daily Baptizing as many now as at any time. We having a spare day a short time since met at Elder Young, Richards and myself were present we had an interesting time much good instruction was given 19 Baptized and confirmed, and Ordained 1. Elder and 6. Priest. Last Sunday I attended a camp meeting and preached upon the Book of Mormon and after Meeting Baptized 14 and 9 next morning We are Baptizing daily and some of the time 4 and 5 times a day these are busy days with me. Preaching, Baptizing, confirming, Ordaining, Counciling, writing, trouhing, keeping journals, and all together gives me but little time to rest But I never enjoyed Better health or Spirits than at the present time. I am now at Elder Thomas Kingtons whare we make it our home he was the superintendent of 45 preachers and the Same number of licensed preaching places. I Baptized him with the other preachers which have opened those doors for us to preach in I Baptized Brother Kington 21st March Ordained him an Elder 22d of March which was a Memoirible event for (Willford Woodruff Jr) Elder Kingtons whole family is in the church their has been ^a notable^ miricle wrought upon one of the family Sister Mary Pitt was confirmed bpage torn ^in bed 6 years^ years page torn and has not walked for 11 years ownly upon crutches Elders Young Richards and myself lade hands upon her and she was healed and now walks upright with out a crutch or staff. Signs are following the believer in this land. My Dear Phebe it does my Soul much good to see your resignation to the will of God in the midst of our seperation. The Lord is blessing me labours much in this land, be patient untill we meet again, you shall not loose your reward, for your reward shall be to stand with me in Zion with the children which God shall give us. and enjoy each others society with our children for one thousand years while Christ reigns and then to inherit the earth together to part no more. and enjoy far greater glories and Blessings than the present state of things can afford. I think this will apaper torn repay us for any sacrifice we can make for a few years. Pray for me that I may be humble in the midst of prosperity as well as adversity. I feel a great desire to do the will of God in all things. My prayer to God is that health and strength, grace and resignation to the will of God may continue with you and the children which God has given us unto the end. and Also that God will Bless Joseph and his councillors with means, wisdom, and power to do the work of God in Zion and her stakes. and that all the Saints may be Sanctified by a Celestial Law is the prayer of Willford Woodruff  Remember me to Brother Meacham I know how to sympathize with him with a broken leg. You ask me if I can tell you when I shall come home No Phebe I cannot tell you now but I shall return to the bosom of my family as soon as the Lord will. I expect quite a number of the saints will go to America from England this fall. We probably shall know more what the will of God is concerning us in few months hence. we have made some enquiry of Joseph (by letter) concerning us we expect to hear from him before long. the Lord is getting some strong holds in this country we are laying the foundation for a mig hty work here, two or three of us think of visiting London immediately after the conference if the Lord will and setting up the work there. write as soon as you get this and give me all the knews and tell me how you and the children get along direct to England.

Woodruff Hancock County Illinois  United States  Ship. via Liverpool and  New York  Willford Woodruff June 3d 1840 England ENDENTRY 52 Ironmonger Row, St Lukes, London. Octr. 30th 1840.  My Dear Phebe, I received your kind and affectionate letter ^written^ in the midst of affliction and mourning under Date of July 18th 1840. truly your letter brought tidings which were painful and sorrowful to me, but notwithstanding this it was not without its joys, For while I keenly  felt the roots, and to mourn the Loss of the lovely flower which God had lent unto us a few days and then taken it away in an hour that was best calcu lated to try the feelings of a kind and affectionate Mother and an absent Father and while I felt to sympathise with my Dear Companion who alone had been  called to watch her tender ospring in my absence and behold her life depart and follow her remains to the grave without a single relative to mingle a tear, you in the  midst of this affliction meditation and sorrow I truly rejoice before the Lord, I rejoice that God hath taught us the principles of life and Death, time and Eternity, the Resurrection  and the judgment. I rejoice that we are not Called to mourn without hope, but that we have the fulest assurance that we shall meet our Child in the first resurrection As we have got to come up through great tribulations in order to inherit the Celestial kingdom of God, I rejoice that in all these trials, sacrifises losses and crosses, we have one the less to go through. I again rejoice that God hath given you grace, strength and fortitude, to support you in the midst of  this deep affliction, and it hath been the highth of my joy, sweetened all my lonely lonely meditations, and filled the days of my consolation to know that God hath granted me a companion in this life who hath been willing to make evry sacrafice  which God hath lade upon her for my sake for the sake of Christ and for the sake of  a celestial kingdom whare we shall reign forever, whare the wicked and ungodly will scease from troubling and the weary be at rest, yes my Dear Companion in affliction, you may rest assured, the whole spirit of your letter the resignation you manifest gives me great joy. I know your sorrow, trials and afflictions are keen, and sacrifices great. Why is it there with you, with me and with the Saints at large in evry age of the World. Ah the first resurrection will tell, the judgment of  the great day will declare, and the Celestial glory of God will more fully illustrate the truth of all these things unto you then I can possibly do with my pen the Lord Jesus suffered and desended below all things, the Holy prophets and Apostles  in evry age of the world have suffered greatly and come up through tribulations in there day and now we have ours, and we shall find at last that all our sufferings  trials, and privations are ownly to prove us and more fully prepare us to rightly prise that rest, comprehend the glory, and enjoy the fulness of that reward which we shall receive at the end of the race, Then under this view of things shall we not kiss the rod and be resigned, I can exclaim yes with every feelings of my Soul, I can say with my Dear Wife the Lord hath given and the Lord hath given and the Lord hath taken away and blessed be the name of the Lord. I I can but bear evry trial that I am called to pass through in this life as well as I have the Death of Sarah Emma I shall bee thankful, she was a beautiful flower, I loved it with all all my heart but as willingly resigned it to God. I shall never forget the last look she gave me when I took the parting  hand with her. The first intimation I had of her death was on the 22d of Oct several  letters was sent me from W. Richards and while reading over the list of the Deaths among the Saints Sarah Emma Woodruff caught my eye, it produced a peculiar sensation in my mind which went through  me like electricity yet my nerve was firm I continued reading as though nothing  had happened and from that moment to the present I have felt perfectly resigned ENDENTRY so by receiving this intelligence I was prepared for the reception of your letter I also feel thankful that you have some friends that try to comfort you in  your afflicitons and necessities, I feel that Sister Margarett has prooved herself a friend in deed as far as it hath been in her power and she shall not loose her  reward and I feel thankful to all the friends for there kindness unto you in  your afflictions, and Mourning. I copied Sister Margaretts lines in my journal  they were sentimental and good. I thank Brother Petty for writing to me I was truly glad to  hear from him. I feel to send my blessings to him and his houshold, Phebe I have  had several interviews with you in my sleep and ^on^ one occasion Sarah Emma was not  with us and I enquired where she was you said she was Dead and gave me sumthing  of an account of it, but as I had heard from you since and she was well, it had almost  worn of my mind, I found from my conversation with you you had many lonely hours, and some gloomy meditations, as you were left alone so long and had no Relatives to keep you company, I know this is trying and none would have bourn it  better than you have done possessing that warm attachment to friends and Relatives  which virtue hath been so perminant in your whole life, Was it in my power  I would willingly bear your sorrows myself, but as I cannot I am comforted  with the reflection, that these sorrowful hours are not lade upon you because of  crime on your part or mine but that we are seperated for the Sake of the  Gospel and the cause of Christ, If any of our friends are in any more comfortable  circumstances as to the things of this present evil world in the midst of ease and  without sacrafice, how will it be a few years hence at the coming of Christ in  the resurrection the general judgment and in the Eternal World. my object is to be  on the safe side there, My object is to secure a safe abode in the Eternal world even a Celestial Kingdom, yes if I can but once see this second to  myself my wife and childen it will amply reward me for all my toils and labours my sacrafises and my hours of sorrow in this life, yes I can say wellcome  all these things If I can but at last obtain the favor of my God and a place  whare he dwelleth with my Wife and the children which God hath given us. My constant prayer to god is that he will feed and cloth you, comfort your  heart, raise you up friends in my absens, and let his angels guard you and give you grace according to your day in all things and spare your life and the remain ning child for my sake. I am sorry you have not obtained more of my  Letters I have written you more than a dozen since I have been in England and I have received a number from you which has done me much good, I also sent a large number of letters to you by Elder Turley and the company which  went with him.

City, Septem. 7, 1860  Brother Gibson: Dear Sir: I received your two letters of  June 15th, and Aug. 7th, respectively; both of which were highly interesting and edyfying. I read them to Prisident Young and council, your Hooper and many other friends,  who were all highly pleased to hear from you. Your daughter says she writes you very often.  Your letters please me they shew plainly that the  spirit of your mission is upon you. Your labor in searching out and stirring up the cold and lukewarm saints in the  various branches through the country was a good work.  Oceanicus' letter to the mountaineer was published and read with much interest.  That the Japanese ambassadors to the proud high-minded Americans, could not find a linguist among the literate of this great nation, who could speak to them without an interpreter till they met a Latter-day Saint, is rather sig nificant and adds to the signs that Israel is to be head and not the tail, and the mighty nations of the earth are begin- ning to feel a little of the forebodings of this truth, notwith- standing the present smallness of the little stone or kingdom which Daniel saw. ##Daniel 2:26-47##  The openings in New York for public lecturing, which you name, and also publishing truth in such extensive public works as the new America cyclopedia, rejoices my heart ENDENTRY for this is opening wide doors whereby much may be accom- plished in a short time.

And I pray the Lord to bless you and to inspire your heart, nerve your spirit and fully  prepare you to magnify that station which you are destined to fill before this generation; yes, brother Gibson as the Lord lives you have a great work to perform in your day and  one too, that will not only cause your heart to rejoice in bearing testimony of the word of God and the revelations of Jesus Christ and the principles of life and salvation, but it will cause the hearts of tens of thousands of the honest of your fellow men to rejoice and be made  glad because of the testimony which you will have power to bear with your words and pen, it will also cause the ears of the  wicked to tingle and their hearts to be pierced with much sorrow  because of rejecting your testimony and the testimony of others of  the servants of God.

It is your privilege to constantly enjoy the Holy  Ghost—to know the mind and will of God concerning you day by day—to be led by the whisperings of the Holy Spirit  in every act of your life. This spirit will reveal to you  every snare and trap, or evil of any kind that an enemy,  whether it be men or devils shall lay for your feet, and will suggest  a way for your escape.  What great blessings the Gospel of Jesus Christ vouchsafes to all who obey its simple precepts and keep the commandments  of God; yet how few place themselves in a position to appreciate  these things. But I will stop preaching with my pen and  refer to some items of news.

Citty Dec. 6th 1840  Dear Willford  I presume you will be somewhat surprised  when you learn where this letter was written but perhapse not more  than I was when I went to my door in Iowa and saw brother  L. Scammans ride up to the door I could hard think  it possible that they could be there but truly strange things happen in  these last days, they came on to see the country and stoped with me about  6 days and insisted on my accompanying them home and spending the  winter at home and then if I wished I could return with you in  the spring so we left Montrose on the 16 of Nov. and arrived here yester- day we have had a good and safe passage thus far and tolerable good health.  our dear little babe was some unwell two or thre days with the chills and  fever but I procured some of the tonic mixture and gave him and it helped  him so he is quite smart now. My health is good accepting some cold occasioned  by traveling. I hope to be comfortably situated in my fathers house before you re- ceive this as we expect to leave here tomorrow for Maine. We are now at  brother girl for a wife about 18 years old.  You told me in your last communication that you was going to send me  some money and wished me to spend it in some ^the^ way that would make me  the most comfortable so I thought that way would be to go home and spend  the winter with my relatives hope to see you in Maine in the spring  I packed up my things and left them at father Clarks where I have been living  and left them in their care with my heifer the cow I let a widow woman have  for her milk she is to keep her for her milk untill my return. I have not heard  from you since last july or your letter was dated th 6th of July where in you  mentioned brother Turley’s return home and mentioned writing and sending me some things by him he had not arrived when when we left but was  expected daily as we heard he had left N.Y. with his company for Montrose but it was getting so late in the season that we dared not wait any longer  so I borrowed 15 dolls. of sister Taylor and told I saw and engaged sister Kimbal to take charge of the things you sent until our return and to pay ENDENTRY pay sister Taylor the sum of money I borrowed of her if you sent  any and left word to have your letters forwarded to me in Maine I feel  verry anxious to hear from you more so since you went to London.  I feel verry thankful that the Lord has blessed you in your ministry in the  maner that he has since you have been gone from home but Oh! how long  you have been gone sometimes my heart almost sinks within me when I  think how long you have been gone and the scenes that I have passed through  since you left me and was I to dwell upon it I should sink beneath it but hitherto the Lord has supported me. do tell me when you think  you will be at home the next time when you write if you camn I  often get quite impatient weighting your return. Could I have taken  our little Sarah east with me it seames as though I should have been  happy but Ah! I had to leave her remains in Commerce while I went  east with my little Willy but not without first visiting her grave and strew ing it with leaves, but I leave this subject. The church in Commerce  and Iowa is increaseing verry fast som some things are taking place in  the church which are bad but bu I will tell you more about it when you come home which I hope and trust will be in the spring and  hope you will be prepared fo with meanes to take me back in the spring ^with you^  although I expect my friends will be opposed to my going back and  that was the greatest and only objection that I had to going home perhapse  they may change my mind upon the subject but I hope not. I want you to  write often for I think you do not feel as lonely as I do. Father Clark’s  family have been verry kind to me ever since I have been there and they  wish to be remembered to you. I have sent you as many as eight or nine  letters since Iyou left N.Y. and paid the postage on them to N.Y. I feel verry  sorry that you do not get them. I have not received any papers from you  in Eng. should be much pleased to read them hope you will bring a coppy  of them home with you and some hymbooks.

I passed by brother Stephen Luces’ where the brethren have met for meeting—thinking I would spend the time in writing to you. Brother Ball arrived here last eve. and brought me a billet from you to day which I was glad to receive. The church here are strong and well engaged likewise the opposers are engaged to. Mr. Carter has held two mock meetings here of late, he has a written manuscript which he has been collecting through the past winter from newspapers andc which he reads to the people with hymns addapted to the occasion. brother Ames and Valentine attended the first meetting and bore a noble testimony for the truth they said they never had so much liberty in speaking before, many people saw the contrast between the two spirits—but none of the brethren attended the last meeting. I have received three letters for you but no papers; one letter was from Mother  Woodruff bearing date of Dec. 31st wherein in she says that she has been quite sick but has far recovered also that father were well and that her faith was encreaseing in the faith of latter Day Saints and that nothing short of it would satisfy her mind andc. andc.—another from brother Asahel wherein he acknowledges the reception of your last letter—his remarks are more favourable than than sometimes—says that he heard brother Terra Haut last fall andc.. The third was from brother Milton he mentions that your much esteamed letter came to hand and was gladly received—he had concluded almost that you had not received his—he likewise received one from Kirtland the same day dated Jan. 14th wherein he received information concerning matters in K. he ENDENTRY requests you to let no one but he writes in confidence to you—says that Sidney took their families Saturday night and it is supposed they have gone to Missourie and the word is for all to follow that possibly can to escape the destruction that is comeing upon K. There is a great division there and a number have left the church and raised what they call a standard of truth and liberty and drew up a remonstration against wickedness and the pro cedings that have been illegally, takeing for their guide the book of Mormon the bible the and covenants for their guide. I will mention some of their names J. F. Boynton and Joseph Coe and Aphia, and many others but I hope not Willford and Phebe—there was about thirty five that signed the remon strance, but the letter stated that there was thousands of the same opinion. The Cowd ry has withdrawn from the church, the printing office has been taken and sold for Joseph’s and Sidney’s debts N. Millikens bid it off, therefore we shall not have the papers at present. I am verry sorry for that for there is much eccitem ent excitement here already about the delay of the papers and I suppose that they have the same account here in the papers that you saw, some of them have already written to the Post Masters in Cleaveland and Kirt. to learn the truth of these things although it is kept private here now. O Willford what is this world comeing to. my heart almost shrinks within me when I look around on the state of things. Brother Ball has received a letter from his Boston requesting him to return to them and he thinks of starting in 8 or 10 days. I rather expect that he will baptize Mr. Lucy Fry as they have been waiting for an oppo- rtunity most ever since you lelft. Brother Ames has had his case tried and the cost was trown upon him. Mr Douglass has been in a great rage about you he says that he will spend all his property in law with you but that he will have his character cleared up, he has applied to two Justices for an execution against you but ENDENTRY but they told him that it was between ministers and they did not wish to meddele with it, but brother Crocket has come over to this district and says that he is more calme than he was. I really hope that he will not procede with his suit for it will only make trouble. I have almost forgotten to tell you that Milton has given up going to Kirt. next spring and wants to come down here in the spring—wants to meet you in Scarborough thinking that you will accompany me there in the spring he wants you to write to him, says that he wishes he was with you here now. Brother and sister Melana send there best respects to you and say they are trying to do as well as they can. I think they are. Sister Sabra are here on a visit and send there love to you and say that the church is doing well there.  They have just come in from meeting and say they have had a verry good meeting, that brother Crocket was wide awake. You did not say any thing about the time that you expected to return here, your three weeks have almost expired and they have been long enough I think. I realy feal lonely here without my page torn but I trust that the Lord will take care of him and return him to me in his time. I dont forget to ask him to daily and trust that I am not forgotten by him. My health is good at present but I have been quite sick with a cold I was much pleased to hear that brother Townsend had joined your company Give my best respects to him and tell him that I want to see him.  Milton's letter was sealed with black and there was greate enquiery concerning the contents, but I did not let them know of the Kirtland affairs, some of them here surmise that a mob has arisen and demolished the press in Kirtland if but I shall keep the letter private untill you come and then you may do as you think best with it. I think that these times will try the faith of the saints but I think that I feael as strong as ever. C There will be great persecution for thes things but there is a God in Israel yet thanks be to God for it. I have not commenced your coat yet but shall soon. I recollect that this is your birthday would be glad to congratulate you upon the same could I have the privilege. This is from your Phebe who is waiting as patiently as she can for your return.

It certainly is gratifying to  me to hear of the prosperity of my Brethren in evey lawful pursuit Brother Asahel I have long felt anxious to again hear from you I am sensible that it is not alltogether profitable to  be always pouring upon any ones mind any subject however good it may be lest be be weary in consequence of which I have remained more silent upon those subjects in which I have been ingaged than I otherwise should have done. But thinking perhaps you would like to Know whare I was how and what I was doing I concluded to call your mind to the perusal of this sheet. I would here rema^r^k that after our last conference in the south I spent a few days in visting the  Churches which God had rased up by my instrumentality in that country I had a good season among them I added 9 to their numbers and took the parting hand I took water at Paducah K.Y. on the 25 th of  Oct after passing one boat that had sunk and run aground ourselves traveled 400 miles we reached Owenton, and spent two weeks preaching and visiting some Kinsman of Elder  Tenne who is with me we then went to Cincinnati visited the big bone lick on the road the place whare those large bones are taken that have been exhibited in Europe and America. When I arived at Cincinnati My first business was  to inquire at the store of Webster and Conway for you they told me you had located at Terrehaute Indianna and I was glad to learn from them that the prospects for your prosperity was flattering ENDENTRY Cincinnati is much of a place of business I sayw while there the Dead and wounded taken from the Flora caused by the bursting of the connecting pipes I took water  at Cincinnati for Wellsville rising of 400 miles I also passed another boat that had run against a snag store her hull and sunk at Wellsville I took the stage to Kirtland 90 miles and whene I arived at Kirtland I was almost asstonished I at the alteration in the place since I was there in May 1834 for when I left there was but few buildings and most of them shanties but now on my returen I fou^n^d a city as it were arising from the hills and dales and a temple standing in its midsts with its steeple pointing towards heaven in honor of that God who commanded it be built and framed the materials of which it was made. It was truly a happy season to my soul to again meet the inhabitants of Kirtland those with whom I had endured perils and tribulations I visited the house of the lord and its contents and I saw that which I did not expect to behold in my generation and among these things I say the Egyptian mummies and also the Book of  Abram written by his own hand in ancient form. On last sabbath I had the privelege of going up to the house of the Lord in Kirtland to  worship with my Beloved Brethren I kno not ownly had the privilege of hereing the word of God in company with about 1,000 Saints from the sacred desk but also of declaring the word of God unto them. my happiness hath been great to behold the work of God in these last days and Allthough the gentiles rages and the priest imagin vain things yet the work of God will roll on in spite of all these things untill babylon shall fall Israel be gathered and Christ reign  I am mow about to commence a cours of study perhaps shall enter school on the morrow what length of time it will take me to accomplish it I am unable to say I may spend the private part of my time for several years in this place. I intend to leave school in the spring a sufficient time to visit my parents and frends in the east and proclaim the gospel unto them I expect to spend the ^ensuing^ summer in Connecticut I am perfectly reconciled with my lot in life I never enjoyed myself better in life than at present. I am now experiencing what I have looked for several years ownly the blessings of God are greater than I ever expected to  behold. enjoy or even hear from in my generation if you ever travel through this county I desire you to visit Kirtland once more as I understood yesterday by Elder Johnston that you called upon him in this place and inquired for me I supposed at It was a year or    ENDENTRY two since I would have been glad to have seen you I hope the day may come when you may have the privelege of fully investigating the cause in which I am engaged for I believe your honesty and dissermment would lead you to imbrace it I have found one thing to be true that when we seek first the Kingdom of God all things els mecessary will be added. I should consider it one of the greatest blessings on earth to have you and the rest of my Kinsman become members of the Church of Latter day Saints and why I  desire it is because I know it to be the true Church of Christ and my friends would be exhalted before God and receieve blessings that fadeth not away I certanly could have no motive to desire my friends to receieve darkness or error But I certainly have a chance and know the reality of these things as well at least as those who are out of the Church and not been privileged with as closan close an inspection as myself yea and even our enemies in this county are beginning to acknowledge of a truth it is in vain to raise their hands against page torn great enemies await us I would to God my friends were page torn for them this world is passing the things of time are transitory the things of the Celestial Kingdom are eternal and worth possessing I desire to meet you there. My hart hath also been much penetrated for Brother Azmon I have loved that Brother I love  him yet I shall still plead before God for him I have no other than the best of feelings towards him Although I am ignorant of his feelings towards me the Lord knows I wish all of my relatives well and if they knew what I know ^not wishing to boast^ they would be up and doing but as it was in the days of Noah so will it be when Christ apperars. ##Matthew 24:37## Is it possible that I cannot have a  natural Brother to partake with me the glory of God in these  last Days I have thought the former Dealings of God with you was preparing you for theis great work I trust time will yet proove it to be so I shall pray for it at least write to me when convnent Direct to Kirtland Ohio (this place) if you have opportunity call and see me it would be a great privelege to me yours with the best of feelings and wishes  W.

Notwithstanding I sent you a long letter about twenty days since; I feel disposed to address you at this time; and could I but read a letter from you half as often as I write to you I should feel exceding thankful: but I make allowances for Sickness and miscarriage of letters andc. I have recieved one letter from you and that was great consola- tion to my feelings. This is the fifth letter I have written to you and I do hope that you have obtained them, the last letter I wrote Nov 24th which I truly hope you will get. When you write to me please be particular to tell me how many of my letters you have received and the dates of them. I am in great hopes that I shall have a letter from you before I leave the City for the City England. I never more highly prised the worth of letter writ ing than since I left home. I suppose of course that you wish to know how matters and times are with me and have been since I last wrote andc. I continued preaching in New Jersey, had full congregations, many were believing, some  were embracing, and a warm and friendly feeling manifest by almost the whole country whare I was. Elder P. P. Pratt called to see us, preached one, and informed me that a conference was appointed in New York City on the 12th inst and wished me to attend I have done so and am now in the City. “the following I copy from my Journal. Dec 11th I took the parting hand with Elder James and Brother Freehold. I there took Stage at daylight and rode 12 miles to Middletown point, there took Steem Boat Wane sailed 30 miles to N. Y. City arived at 12 oclok. I entered the city “and found it full of armed Soldiers spedily preparing for war thee Steem Boats were chartered to conveyed them to Albany to fight several thousand Du- Dutchman that ware citizens near Albany that had strongly fortified themselves with canon and small arms, it is said they will not pay their tokens or depts or sumthing or other of that kind, and so they are going to fight about it, how much “Blood will be shed I dont know. at any rate it is beginning to be war and sum “our through America and Europe and all things are in commotion. After dining in King stret, I called upon Elder P. P. Pratt in Mott street No 58 found him and fam- ily well. Elders P. P. Pratt and J. Ball accompayed me to the post office. I received two letters one from Milton Holmes he had been quite sick, lost $70 dollars, was very poor, had no decent clothes, could not go to England, hardest times he ever saw, could not get a dollar in money, but was gaining in health, was strong, in faith, urged me to remember him to Phebe andc. andc. I did not get a letter from Phebe but took one out for Montrose I gave the letter to ENDENTRY Sarah were getting better, so Brother Pratt told me. You may be assured those words were precious to me, for I dreamed a few nights before that Sarah was dead but I thought the dream might not be true, but come though multitude of business and though. I returned and took supper with Elder Pratt, he has got a good wife she often speaks of you, the whole family has had the fever and ague in the City but have got well. I attended meeting at candlelight in Grand Street in the Columbian Hall which the Saints have higherd hired to hold their meeting in, it is in the most popular part of the city, rent $9 dollars per Day Parley gave us a lecture upon the origins of the Indians and Book of Mormon. I had the happy privilege of taking Brothers Turley once more by the hand and found them well, truly the mercy of God has been great unto us all. N. Y. expet them in the city every day. After meeting Elder Taylor accompanied me to my boarding place in King Street and we retired to rest. Distance of the Day. 60 m Thus ended the business of the 11th Day of Dec with me. Yesterday I called upon Ilus at his Store 118 Bleacker Street corner of Woster I found him well and in good spirits. he had recieved a letter from Ezra, Maine but exceding hard times. Last evening I sat in conference at Elder P. P. Pratts house in Mott street 58. the conferenc was called in conference consequence of an improper course persued among the churches by Elder Richards we did not get through last evening but meet for the same purpose this evening. The work of the Lord is still progressing in this country. Parley is labouring faithfully in this City both in public speaking and printing. he has already out of the press 2,500 of the voice of warning. 2,500 of the persecution of the Saints will soon be out in bound volume, 2,500 of the Book of Mormon I expect will soon go to press and also he has other works in the press the work is not ownly progressing in this City. but a great work is opening in the City of Philadelphia 30 or 40 have been baptized mostly under the laboursers of B. Winchester and hunders hundreds are believing Brother Winchester wished me to call and labour awhile with him and I should have done so If I had not been suddenly called to this City to have attended this con ference. Elder O. Pratt has gone to hold a protracted meeting 30 miles from philadelphia with Elder Barns I was informed last evening that that had baptized about 40 during the meeting. and their are many calls for labourers. andc. The Elders here all wish to be remembered to you and to their families as far as you have oppertunity to inform them Elder Turley is writing a letter to his wife on the same table with me. Remember me ENDENTRY to all the Saints in Lovely Street, Commerce as far as they inquire. Brothers Hadlock, andc. went to Kirtland and spent some time there and they say they would not like to have their family is there for they think it harder times than it is in the west to get a living. Perhaps our friends in the West may wonder at our tarrying on this continant so long but the reason in short is the want of means to pay our fare to England we have had much to struggle with. We left home without purs or scrip, and sick and feble but through the great mercy of God we have all been able to reach New York but we all arived here nearly penny less but as I have been out into the country the Lord has put into my hands means sufficient to pay my own fare, but I feel equally interested in the wellfare of my Brethren that they also may have means to go on my their way as well as myself. I know the enemy has struggled hard to prevent the Twelve from filling this mission. Will he finally prevail No God forbid, we are determined to soon stand in England if we go their through the greatest perils. Yes I say in the name of the God of Israel I will lift up my voice in England in preaching Jesus Christ and him crusifed and cry repent- anc to that people and that spedily to, for the spirit of God is like fire shut up in paper torn my bones and rolling as with electricity though my spirit crying Haste Haste paper torn they know not what awaiteth them.

I was much pleased with my acquaintance with Brother Clayton I consider him a worthy Brother a man of wisdom and of God. I was called upon in the evening with Brother Clayton to go and visit that Sister that has been so much afflicted possessed with the Devil andc. I do not recollect the name. her husband that was considered under Transgression came to us and confessed his Sins, and next day made acknowledgments before the church. When we arived at his house his wife was in a great rage required 3 men to hold her We lade hands upon her and after a mighty struggle cast the devil out and rebuked the fever and she was made whole and was at meeting comfortable next day, but the devil entered into her child next, day and flung it into a dredful agony and made it as stiff as a stake, we lade hands upon it, and the devil instantly came out and the child fell asleep. I have herd nothing from them of late. We preached with them on Sunday and had a pleasant time with them. We left Manchester on  the 21st and rode to Burslem, and found Elder Cordon and the Saints well. I found them meeting with some opposition in Burslem such as getting the candles and candlesticks flung at their heads while preaching. The rabble generally was lead by John James. We immediately commenced preaching and opening new doors as we had an oppertunity. One evening while I was preaching in Burslem John James came with two constables (to keep the peace for he feared the people) while he could read a  pamphlet exposing Mormonism taking taken from Mormonism unveiled and W. Parrish letters and P. P. pratts andc. I helped him to read then what I could, by giving him lights, and water to quench his thirst, and calling for order while the house was hissing at him when he got though I answered him and the people retired in peace, his opposition ENDENTRY has injured him and given us friends. We have held regular meetings on the Sabbath in Hanely. We now have meetings in Burslem and Hanly, Lane End, and a number of other places, round about I have been informed that the Rector in New Castle is preaching against us quite a number of Methodist teachers attend our meetings and freequently oppose but they go away confounded while it begets us friends. We have quite a good room in Hanly that we have lived for six months, which will be the standing place for the church to meet in on the Sabbath we have vary full and attentive congregations how many will come out in this regeion I do not know but the work seams to be prosperous here as yet, their has been a number baptized since we came, the Church now Numbers between 70 and 870 and others given in their names. I became convinced it was the will of God for one of us to go to Birmingham and taking all things into consideration we thought it best for Elder Turley to go. and consequently he left Burslem for Birmingham on the 28th Jan and I suppose is now labouring in Birmingham but I have not herd from him since he Left. We are determined by the assistance of God to open a Door in Every town from the Potteries to Bir mingham and erect a Standard in it. I feel as though it will be a day of warning and not of many words to England. I think that what we do we shall do quickly. I would here also remark their are a number of Doors opening in the towns between the Potteries and Samuel Heath and Elder Clark I believe are labouring there. I am enjoying good health and spirits and the Saints generally are well, and wish to be remembered to you and Elizabeth Revenscraft sends her respets to you and Sister Richards and says tell Brother Richards that Mother will not have any more preaching at her house. I wish you to Remember me to Sister Richards, and the family where you reside and to Sister's Fielding, and Dawson, and all who inquire. I suppose I have not had any letters as yet come to Preston.

As to news with us I have nothing very special to say ownly I am stiring the people up much in this country at the present time Hanly esspecially I preached thursday night in Hanly to about 400 people and a number of priest came out armed with ^ivisible^ weapons to give me dreadful battle upon the Book of Mormon the Lord showed it to me and I preached to them upon the Book of Mormon and disarmed them of every weapon that they had chosen to fight me with and it flung them into confusion and they did not wish to leave with out doing sumthing and so they jumped upon a Bench and raved and hollowed like mad men untill they were not ownly choaked up but pulled off from the Bench by by the people I gave answers to their hurrang harangue as long as I thought it wisdom and then left the house all in an uproar, I lig like to see ENDENTRY some excitement and things are working about right now in the potteries to have the people hear the word whether they embrace it or not, the priest are quite mad because we are getting a hold in Hanly we have a good house to preach in and we have a worthy brother who has rece ived the work and his doors are opened unto us constantly. he is a Merc- hant in the place his wife and servent are also members of the Church We shall have warm opposition in Hanly for it is the seat of iniquity and pristcraft but the Lord is with us. I preach on the mor row Sunday in Corden in Hanly. I receved a letter from Elder Birmingham preaching to his relatives in the family circle. but was soon expecting to preach in public. he foud hard work to preach to his parents who had been professors of Godliness 40 years and had great confidence in their ministers. Brother H. Glover has just returned on a visit to his friends about 50 miles and some rage and fight otherers want the word and some wish to be Baptzed. But I will close about matters with us  Now Dear Brother with respect to your Difficulty that you spoke of I will acknowledge I have not had time to meditate upon it and pray about it as much as I could wish but yet the spirit of God knows all things I am sensible you have many difficulty things to encounter. I do not know what better you could have done than the course you have persued con sidering all circumstances, but one thing is certain sumbody is much out of the way. In the first place I ask in the name of reason and Revelation that if Sister D is sick what business Sister C or any other person has to accuse her of feigning herself sick, the principle is of the Devil and the spirit of God bears record against it. If Sister C had charity and the Love of God in her soul and was in the way of her Duty she would go and sympathise with Sister D instead of speaking against her and that to behind her back such things are agaist the law of God and iniquity cannot be retained in the church of christ or at least it should not. The church did right in withdrawing the hand of fel- lowship from Sister C, and she ought not to be restored unless she will make an humble acknowledgement of her sins and repent of them before God. if others had sined ever so much it is no place for Sister C to make a bulwark of ENDENTRY to shelter her sins behind. Again the principle of finding fault with a Brother and or Sister and speaking evil of them behind their backs as a sin that God hates and if it is not repented of it will bring the curse of God upon the heads of those that are thus guilty. and I believe their is eviel of this kind in Preston, and their are those in preston that have wrongly accused and had evil surmisings both towards you and Sister Richards and if they do not scease from those things and spedaly repent their wickedness shall be manifest and their eniquity brought to light and they will feel the chastning hand of God, and I say it in the name of Jesus christ. I know it is difficult to deal with such cases whare they are all pointed towa rds ones own self, but I am more and more convinced and that to by the spirit of God, that the church Will never prosper in preston untill they treat you in a different manner from what they are doing at least many of them, they ought to sympathize with you in your affliction and assist you to the necessaries of life, and uphold you by love, confidence prayer and faith, it is what God requires at their hand. Brother and Sister Richards dont be discouraged, the Lord will give you the victory, you shall overcome and your Enemies shall not prevail against you, I  will plead with God for you, you shall have my prayers if I can do nothing more. I would say in all cases of Church dealing it would be well to persue the gospel course and it appears that you have done and leave the event in the hands of God. and let us ask God for wisdom and he will give it unto us. My Love to Sister Richards and all who inquire a letter from you will meet a welcome reception at any time Dont trouble yourself about the postage it is but a trifle I I will pay it. excuse the hasty scribling of this sheet. That health, strength, faith, grace, and evry needful thing may rest upon you from God our Father and our Lord Jesus christ is the prayer of your Brother in the Love of God  W.

Sept 12th, 1840.  Elder G. A. Smith.  Beloved Brethern,  I am in the midst  of the saints at the Leigh enjoying good health and spirits. and while  meditating upon the scenes which have transpired with me during the  last 23 days which has been spent with you on a mission in the  City of London, I feel disposed to pen a few of my thoughts on paper for your  perusal. Brethren this is the first mission we have ever enjoyed together in the vineyard. Can  we for a moment say that our time hath been spent in vain during this period? Nay we cannot  the spirit within me forbids it. Have we not profited by this school of experianc? yea much  evry way. While the Lord hath manifested by revelation that it is his will that we should obtain a  knowledge of Kindgdoms and countries, this mission hath placed us in a situation to avail our-  selves of the desired information upon many things that which we could not otherwise have obtained. Time will clearly show that the late mission which we have enjoyed together in the City of London (which is still continued by your labours) will ever be firmly engraved  in our minds and occupy an important place, In the history of our travels among the  Nations of the Earth. When London feels the chastning hand of the ALMIGHTY  and in her turn amid the revolutions of the gentile world finds her doom is sealed with her lofty spires, synagogues, mansion, and pallaces, laid in one common ruin, then with what feelings shall we address our children or the thousands that may surround us, while our heads are blossoming with age, as we point to the 21st day of September ^october Aug^ 1840, when we  stood together upon the top of the most splended and highest modern pillar in the Univers and with the naked eye surveyed the most populous and wealthy city upon the face of the  earth, which we can then exclaim hath been the theater of much misry and wo, but now sleeps in death. We ^having in my possessin a history of places visited I feel disposed to give the same {that and may he give} a correct {account of} the {same} to refer to^ shall not readily forget ^on the 24th oct we visited^ Oct Aug 24th while we walked to and fro through St Pauls Cathedral which was 500 feet in length 285 in bredth 404 in highth which was 40 years in building from 1675 to 1715 which cost £136000 or $3,680,000 ^£l,567,076,15. $ 5880,380^ which contains  47 monuments of fine marble erected over the Tombs of certain Lords Bishops Generals  Earls and other titles who had distinguished themselves in the military service of Great Brit- ian and otherwise, Lord Nelsons being the most noted, and while historians have taken much  interest in the origen of this cathedral dedicated St Paul which was first built by St Augustine in the year 610, and now considered the largest cathedral in the world excepting  the Vatian at Rome dedicated to St Peter. We ^ourselves^ can clearly see the gentiles are zealous in  a form of Godliness while they deny the power thereof, for while this church stands in  honor to St Paul, those who whorship therein utterly reject and deny the principles which  he tought. Again I think we shall not doubt the words of Soloman when he said man had  sought ought many inventions esspecially when we reflect back to the 1st day of Sept, when  We desended together about 40 feet into the Bowels of the earth and walked throught the Thames Tunnel with the River Thames and British shiping over our heads which was opening a thorough  fare from one shore to the other which was finished 1110 ^feet^ and was lighted with gas, arched  overhead and considered one of the greatest wonders of the last days. The time we spent  together on the 5th of Sept Visiting Westminster Abbey was not unprofitable, had we  travled the world oer we could not have found another spot that would have pre- sented a wider field of knowledge and of contemplation as touching the history of the  rise, progress, and fall of Kings, Princes Lords and mighty men of Gentile greatness pride  and boast. This Abbey was composed of eleven Chapels (ownly seperated by walls or petitions) ENDENTRY Viz 1. St. Benedict. 2. St. Edmund. 3. St. Nicholas. 4. Henry the Seventh. 5. St. Paul. 6. St. Edward the Confessor. 7. St. Erasmus. 8. Abbot Islip. 9. St. John. 10. St Andrew and 11. St. Michael. and these Chapels contain the Bodies, tombs, and monuments, of of elveven Twelve ^13^ Kings viz Edward I. — III. — V — VI. Charles. II. Henry III. — V. — VII. James I. George II. Richard II. and William III. and Sebert King of the east Saxons who first built this church  and died July 616 Also Twelve ^13^ Queens viz Athelgoda, Queen of Sebert who Died Sept 13 615 and Phillippa, Matilda. Mary I. — II. and Queen Mary of Scotland, Elizabeth, Catherine,  and Queen Anne and Editha, Eleanor and Caroline and of ^six^ Prince's George, and Eleven ^11^ Dukes, seven ^7^— Duchess, one ^1^ Marquis, Seven ^7^ Lords, three ^3^ Vicount, Eight ^8^ Countess, three ^3^ Barrons sixteen ^16^—  Earls, eleven ^11^ Admirals, twelve ^ten 10^ Generals, 5 Col, ^3 Majors^ 10 Capt. 4 Lieut. 16 Bishops. 6 Divines 15 Doctors, 52 Sirs. 153 Gentleman, and 48 Ladys, making 421 persons who have been  deposited in vaults in this Abbey and Monuments erected to their memory. Here we had the privilege of viewing the full stature and perfect likeness of Queen Elizabeth, Mary, and Anne  Lord Nelson, and Pitt and others. We saw the full Coronation Dress of Queen Anne. We  also saw the chair and sat in it, in which Queen Victoria was crowned and all the Kings  and Queens in England for the last 800 years this chair is covered with gold tissue. It  contains a stone under the seat upon which all the Scottish Chiefs, and Kings were crowned  since they were a people it is reported to be Jacobs Pillar which chair has been in use 800 years. In walking through this Abbey we see frequent marks of violence from Oliver Cromwell in defacing some of the tombs, monuments, and brass work with which some of the Abbey was  adorned. Here we behold the art of man with all its combined force and power spun to the  finest thread, and expanded to the fullest extent in the building and finishing of this Abbey as  a general whole, But more esspecially that part called Henry Sephenth Seventh's Chapel and a visit to this Abbey is not ownly worthy of the Attention of all travellers but to occupy  a place in the Journal of any Historian.  While speaking upon this subject I would  not pass over our visit to the house of Parliment, on the 8th of Sept. As we entered the  house of Lords (now occupied as the house of Commons) ^we did not behold^ so much to interest the sight of the eye as  the meditation of the mind, however we had the privilege of resting ourselves by siting in the chair in  which the speaker of the house of Lords had sat for many years. In this room all the speeches were  made by Mr William Pitt while advocating the American cause, before the Revolution. In this room all the laws were made that now governs ^from^ 175 to 200 000 000 of human beings. As the house of  commons was burned down about six years since this room at the present time is occupied by ^for^ the  house of commons and there is another house now built which the house of Lords at the  present time occupies. One would naturly suppose that a house of Parliament fitted up to  contained Kings, Lords, and Commons would be sumthing extra, grand, and expensive but we found  it quite the reverse. It is excedingly plain and undecorated. On entering the room one would  sooner think he was in an American school house rather than in a house of Lords or of Commons. While retiring from this scenery we had a view of the order of British soldiery or foot guards while on parade in St James' Park, accompanied by a full band of music. Also of the Queens  Horse guard 100 in number well mounted upon fat gay black mares, and the steel with which  their bodies were covered glistening in the Sun. We might make mention of the monument erected in honour to his grace the Duke of York which was 135 feet in highth and of the  mansion of Queen Dowager widow of the Late King Williams IV which we had a  view of as we past along. In fine St James Park is surrounded as it were with Dwellings mansions, castles, monuments, and Palaces, of the first class as to size, splendour, and Note of any in  Europe, of which Buckingham Palace is the Chief. this is for the Royal Family and is now  ENDENTRY occupied by Her Majesty Queen Victoria, and his Highness Prince Albert, except while they are at Buckingham Palace Covers a number of acres of ground and is surro unded by a high wall of hewn stone except the front which is a high fence of cast Iron railing, and evry door, enterence, and gate was strongly guarded by armed soldiers. I walked  nearly around this castle Palace, and while there I for the first time had a view of his  Royal Highness Prince Albert while he was riding from his palace across St James Park mounted upon a gray horse accompanied ownly by his groom who was riding a sorrel horse. I also spent a few moments in the National gallery which was ^is^ not unprofitable to a traveller desiring to form a knowledge of countries and the art of man. This gallery contains a vary  great and extensive variety of the most Perfect Paintings that could be gathered together  by the Nation, these with other things we have had the privilege of forming a  knowledge of for ourselves. ^But^ Brethren while you discover that I hav written rather  largely concerning these temporal and perishable objects which are in the same state, and doomed to  share the same fate in the revolutions of the last days and the fall of Babylon, as Jerrusalem did when they rejected their king and put to death the Messiah, think not that I for a moment harbour the idea that the ownly benefit we have derived in the enjoyment of our late  mission together in the City of London has been a knowledge of these things, far from this. for while I have spoken of these things while they were in memory more for the purpose of preserving a historical sketch of the same than other wise, still the remaining part of  the subject rest upon my mind with greater weaight. Yes Brethren our late mission together  has not ownly put us in possession of a knowledge of those things spoken of but it hath  given us a more intimate acquaintance with each other and that to in some degree in the midst of trials, which acquaintance has had a tendancy if possible to unite our hearts more closer together in the love of God and the New and Everlasting Covenant. this is  not all. we have stood together in this first mission to the city of London in which  we have had the privilege of uniting our labours in lifting up the standard of truth, of  light, and the fulness of the everlasting gospel, and When on dilligent search we found the whole  city given to Idolitry, Priescraft, tradition, superstition, and all manner of abominations wick- edness, and uncleanness and all doors closed against us we did not hesitate to stand in  the midst of the streets and Jonah like cry repentance unto the Inhabitants of that mighty  city, The Metropolis of Britain, the Boast of the Gentiles and the largest city in the world, containing one million five hundred thousand souls who were  ripened in iniquity, andprepared for the wrath of God, and like the ox going to the slaughter  know not the day of their visitation. Yes Brethren I shall long remember standing in  the midst of that people and assisting you in bearing a message unto them, a message—  ENDENTRY which will prove a savior of life unto life or of Death unto Death not ownly unto  them, but unto all they unto whom the sound thereof shall come, even of the whole  gentile world and the judgment of the great day shall manifest the truth of it unto all  nations. And it will ever sweeten the memory of that eventful period of my life  to know that our labours on that occasion were not in vain. But that we were  enabled through the great mercy and goodness of God and toil, labour, dilligent search, and  perseverance, to find some of the Blood of Ephraim, a few honest souls that were  willing to recieve and obey the gospel and that we were enabled to lay the foundation  of a work in that City which will not be removed untill the City is warned so that  they will be left without excuse, and the saints gathered out to stand in Holy places  while judgment works. Untill that time the seed which we have sown in that  city and that which you are now sowing shall bring forth fruit and the fruit  shall remain to the honour and glory of God and I say it in the name of  Jesus Christ and the Spirit Beareth record and the record is true. Therefore  Brethren let your souls rejoice, and your hearts be made glad, that we are permitted  to bear some humble part in the sacrafices, sufferings, and reproach of Christ and of  warning this generation and of gathering together the honest in heart and the meek of the Earth that they with us may stand together in Holy places while judgement  works ^works^, and be prepared to enter into that rest which remaineth for the People of  God. And Dear Brethren my prayer to God is that we may ever be meek and humble  that the Power of the Priesthood and the spirit of our ministry and mission may rest upon  us that we may be carried through evry strait Place wherein we are called to walk that we may keep the faith and overcome the world. I pray my heavenly Father in the name of  Jesus Christ that this may be our happy lot and that we, with all the Elders of Israel, and Saints of God may be prepared to joyfully meet our Lord and Master when he appeareth again the second  time without sin unto salvation.

I wish we had a few copies of the voice of Warning which I think would do good to be put into the hands of some inquiring minds I know not what will be done here in London, it seems to be rather slow making a Start, it is sumthing as it was  in Edinburgh We cannot get many of the people out to hear But yet we do not feel all at all discouraged about the matter the work is in the hands of God, and we leave it with him We mean to do the Best we can. I dont know what the day will bring forth we have a meeting this afternoon and Evening.

We have had more this evening than any other meeting and a good deal of interest manifest one man told me after meeting that if our meeting was known in London we should have crowded houses, but there is so much going of evry thing now and nature that it almost wants a trumpet Blown from heaven in order to call the people together here, but we are begining to be known some here and we feel incourged give us your prayers, that God may bless you and family is the prayer of Woodruff and Smith ENDENTRY Dear Sister Richards  I wonder If I could not have a few words from your pen, it would be pleasing to me. I suppose you say saw the letter from my wife. It was truly a trial to her to loose her little girl so sudden and that to in my absence but she bears it vary well, and feels quite resigned it gave me a sudden shock when I first saw it in Elder Richards letter but it was but for a moment. I felt much resigned to it. I have written my wife a long letter which I sent her yesterday. I was glad to hear that you and Heber John was comfortable I hope the Lord will spare your life and the lad to see good days. Sister Margarett Smoot wrote vary feeling about the death of our little girl, and Brother Petty seems to think that the Missourians are much troubled about the 50 men going up to make a new Settlement. He sayes Govr Carlin has made a demand of Gov Boggs of our Brother that was kidnaped and says he will cary it to the fullest extent of the Law. Brother Petty thinks it will make some disturbance between Missouri But I say go ahead. I dreamed my child was dead on the night of the 18th of July the day after it was buried. I dreamed a few nights ago of ketching a great mess of large fish and I thought Brother Asahel Woodruff who has Been dead 2 years came and helped me, the next night I dreamed of ketching and rosting clams out of the sea the next night I dreamed snakes came and got around me and I kelled them by whiping their tales around Apple trees and acrossed ragged rocks so sumthing is going to happen some day please write me a letter when your are able and have time and tell all the news give our love to Susanna and to all the Saints I havnt room to  call them by name take good care of the Lad and may the Lord Bless you all is the prayer of your Brother in the kingdom of Patience W Woodruff ENDENTRY News says steam ship Brittanna is sunk I dont know whether it be true or fals.

In the  first place I will ^wish to^ say I have not been Idle since I learned that the inhabitants of the vally had organized a State Governtment  and that you was their delegate to Washington but I  have endeavored to do all in my power to assist the cause in any way that I could, and I am fully convinced from what I have learned from various sources and classes that a most judicious, wise, discreet and prudent cource must  be carried out in this affair in order to secure success I also firmly believe that you ought not to commit yourself in the least by taking sides with the democrats whigs, Free Soil, or any ^othr^ party for by so doing at the commencement of the service I belive it would be certain death, to your  success but take a Neutral groud at first and watch the signs of the times and then act according to circustances you will  probably meet with the most exciting Congress that ever  assembled in the United States, and the parties are so even balanced ENDENTRY that to take sides with either party at first would defeat the Bill altogether, I think have an influential friend who  is vary intimate with the members from Maine who will  use his influence for them to go with for our Bill I have  assisted Dr Bernhisel concerning the petition what I could, and  He has had an interview with many influential men and  He has always taken a Neutral ground which I think is a  wise courcse and the ownly safe one at the commecent commencement of  this session And I hope you will have an interviewed  with him at the earliest opportunity and that you will be  enabled to unite your influece and council together  And my prayer to God is that you may be prospered  in this laudible and glorious enterprise, and that prudence Wisdom and success may attend you in obtaining a seat for  Deseret in the circle of her sister States is the cincere desire  and warmest wish of my heart  Yours Truly  Wilford Woodruff  P.S. I should essteem it a great favor to meet in Concil  with you and Dr Bernhisel at Washington but do not now expet to have the opportunity.

I think your interesting visits in our midsts, your travels in our encampments, your clame of observations in our families Assem- blies and Councils whare the sentiments of our hearts have been freely poured out before you must all combine to convince you that the inhabitants of the State of Deseret will never sustain in any wise the institution of Slavery in their midst. We are a peaceful and industrious people have removed to the sequestered vally of the Great Salt Lake. we do not wish to have anythg to do with the "vexed question of Slavery" or any of the other exciting political questions and therefore we deemed it expedient not to introduce a clause into our Constitution prohibiting the introduction of Slaves into the State of Deseret but Slavery can never be Tolerated there  With Sentiments of the highest Respect I remain yours Truly  Wilford Woodruff ENDENTRY Copy of A Letter written to Col Kane Nov 27—49 ENDENTRY Philadelphia Dec 4th  Col Kane  Dear Sir  I called Satudy and Mondy at your Office to see you a few moments I leave this afternoon for New York.

If I mistake not the petition to which the signers names are attached calls for a Territorial Governmnet if that is the case it appeares to me that that petition should not be presnted befoe Congress by any means untill it is altered I think that wise policy would dictate that the word Territory be not so much as once named in any petition or address which you have to lay before congress in the request which is now made at there hands, but State and State alone the ownly thing we ask for and with my present feelings I pray to God with all my heart that sooner than to have a Territorial Govenment given us that they may not be permitted to give us any ^a^ Govement at all unless by all means we could have our own Govenor and other offcers which is a vary uncertain matter, if we could not get a State would it not be better to withdraw the bill or petitions as we afterwards could again present a petition for a state while if we were a Territory we could not do it perhaps for many years besides all the trouble that would arise from Haveing officers and polititions among us who would have no interest in our wilfare I throw these things out as they rest upon my mind for your consideratin this subject is increasing upon my mind and rests with wait upon me more and more day and night and is uppermost above all other considerations and I do not know but I feel as much interested in it as though the whole concern rested upon my shouldiers for it is not a work merely to aggrandize or set up any one man or set ENDENTRY of men to get some paltry office a little salary or a name but objets far more Noble and glorious are at stake in which we areall feel an equal interest.

ENDENTRY sideways text Copy of A letter written to A W Babbitt Esqr Jan 21st 1850 end of sideways text  Cambridgeport Mass Jan 21st 1850  Dear Sir  Yours of Jan 16th has just come to hand and I must Confess that I am much surprised at its contents and  do not understand it. and I feel think it needs some wisdom to answer such letters in a right and proper manner lest misun- derstanding arise of an unpleasant nature between men who are  endeavoring to bring to pass the same object. It it's is also often more  difficult to explain many matters and things by Letter writing than it is in personal Conversation, However I will venture to come to the subjet  you say you have not recieved a letter from "any one haveing influenc in the Church" "Or from any leading men in the Chuch" Now I may not be a proper judge what amount of influence I may have in the Church Still I believe I have some and have endeoved endeavored to use that influenc for  the general good of the whole to the best of my ability" I write you a letter by Dr Washington to cooperate (as I supposed) with you) for the vary purpose of laying a foudations to Correspond with you. The following was the closing remarks "I should essteem it  a great favor to meet in council with you and Dr. Bernhisel at Washington  but do not now expet to have the oppertunity" I should take it as a  faver if you would write to me occasinally and infore me of your  progress and prospets" This letter you recieved. On my I also  addressed a short note to you while at New York as a Letter of introduction of Mr Copway who was expeting to go Soon to Washington  you may not have recieved it. After being absent from Home on  my Western tour two months during which time I addessed assemblies of some kind almost every evening during my absence and tracting constantly by day, I arved home wearried out whae I found ENDENTRY instead of finding rest I found a vary large nuber of  lying before me some 25 ^many^ letters from various parts of the world among them was one from Dr Bernhisel and one from yourself. I  also had received among othr thgs an Epistle from the valley and Letters from the presidency ^in the valley^ requiring certain things of ^me^ my hads  which required me to correspod with the Churches which  I have to do by lettr writing as I have No other way of Communi  cation with them, and Hence I need to write some 50 Letters and mail last Week and among thous I sent one ^one of that nuber I sent^ to Washington which I  happened to write and address to Dr. Bernhisel instead of yourself  as I had Nothing to communicate except what was from the  valley and that I expeted you would both receve before mine woud arive in the form of a visit from Messers Wooley or by the Epistle, still lest you should not receve it I send it in my letter to Dr. Bernhisel, and if ^my^ I had had time  ^had permtted^ I should have ansued both letters, or if I had known that  or even thought that it would have made any difference in  your feelings, or that you ^consdered you^ was slighted I certainly should  have addressed you instead of him, But such a thought  neer entered my mind. In addressing him or if I had addessed you upon that subject it would have been the came with me for I  should have Had no othr thought but that one comunicatin to  either of you Concning any News from the valley would have been  Communictated to equally to both, for I had the not the most distant idea but what you were haveing a free exchange of views and  sentiments, in a sotcial manner, almost daily, for the Dr Berhisel had neer hinted any idea contrary to it in any communcation to me. I  wrote to the Dr as We had spent Considerable time in social con- versation upon a variety of subjects, ^just previous to his going to Washington^ and I should liked to have enjoyed the came privilege with your self, that is the ownly lettr I ENDENTRY have writtenthe Dr ^Berhisel^ Since my return Home.  I Haven got recieved a letter from him to day by the same mail that Brought yours. As to ^the^ accusations against me in the phrasologey  of wanton Neglect in not writing you is an accusation that I shall  not recieve for I am not guilty, in in that sense of the word and I think friends ought to study each othrs Circumstnces sufficiently at least to lay a fondatiun for reasonable excuses whae their is any seeming neglect towards us before we acee them to strongly. I wrote you a letter to lay the fondation for  a Correspondane you answered it and the following is your closing remak "I will keep you informed of all matters and things transpiring here as touching our common Interest," that letter it is true I did not answer." In this it may hve appeared to you a seemg neglect, still I do not think from that circustanc you  are warranted in taking the strong grounds in which you accuse  me, for in reality I did not intend any neglect whateve for as I hve already explaned I thoght one Communication  every Western officers ^upon the subjet which I wrote^ would answer for both this in  Connexion with my being overwhelmed is business was the ownly reasn why I did not write to both, and agn  frm your last sentanc I judged that I should hve reced received anoth letter from you before long. So much I hve said for myself, As conceing Mr Hyde I have ownly to say  that I have no knowledge concing am any instructions He may  have recieved from the presidency concing your mission  or any othe Subject any further than what is made public  through the prress. For although I hve been travelling in this  Easten Contry among the Chches, for near two years and sent him many ^a dozen or more^ letters, containg some 60 or 70 subscribers for the Guadan yet I have never as I recollet recved but two commdtes ENDENTRY from Him of any kind, and that mostly cncing concerning a poer of Attorny to collet some money for some powers in Iowey. Yet notwhstd all this I have not for a momet suffered the spirit of prejudice or Jealousy to take root in my heart agaist him as though  He was neglecting me or was not interestaed in my welfare  or prosperity, or equally ingaged in the same Common  cause with myself, and I have not felt in the least to imparte it to any other cause ownly that He was overwhelmed in busness and cares.  I am aware there from conversation with yourself and public papers, that there had been a ^former^ differenc  betwng you and Mr. Hyde But since that He has published throgh the Guadian that it was all made up and settletled and  I had no idea but that you were on the best of terms But to sum up the whole matter ^of this subjet^ my views are those That the cause ^in which^ you are ingaged in is of Equal interest to  yourself, Dr Bernhisel, Mr Hyde, myself,  and evy good man who expets to become a Citizen of the State of Deseret, and I  consider that any man who has any different veiws of this subjet  has a wrong one. Men may differn in politics, I nevr cast any other vote at the poles in my life, even my Father before me  that I werehve any knowledge of, except a Democrat vote, still and  consider our petition to Congress for a Goverment for Deseret a vary differet thing from party politics, I consider it are common cause for all the inhabitants of that Stat whether thy they be wDemocrats Whigs or Free soil and I consider any lawful or legarl influenc extented to eventually give Deseret a  State Gvement to be of interest and worth to her inhabitats let it  eminate from what party it may. This I have given you  my views concering thesee points in your letter that needed explanatin as feel as I am enabled to do in a communcatin of this kind and I hope it will be satisfactory as far as I am conceed concerned.  ENDENTRY sideways text  Copy of A Letter  to J. M. Bernhisel March 26th 1850  Cambridgepot Mass Mach 26th 1850  Brother Bernhisel  Dear Sir  I receved your interesting Letter of the 22nd intat and nothing but a croud of businss has prevented me from you upon the subjet of which you speak even befoe I receved yours. I was privileged with the company of professor J B. Wallace on the Sabbath and I convrsed freely with those Brethn upon the Subject and I find but one spirit and opinion prevailing amog us and that is, it is far better to withdraw the petition for the present untill you can consult your constituents than to receive a Territorial Government with Military polititions sent unto our midst to tyronize ovr us who has no interest in our welfare it is my firm conviction that the Citizens of Deserett will sustain you in withdrawing your petition for the time being rather ^than^ to receive a Terratorial Government with the spirit of restrictions that the present Congress manifest in disposition to lay upon us. Yes Brothe Bernhisel watch well the signs of the times in this matter do not let a net be flung ovr the people of Deserett to their inquiry they should have the rights of Citizenship as well as other people. The president has recomedend in his speach a thought that the people of the Basin ENDENTRY would not suffer materially if they did not get a Territorial Government immediately or something to that Effect. I am of his opinion I think so to I think it would be a good plan to take his advise and withdraw the petition! If we want a Territorial Government we can call for it another session If we want a State Government we will be in also be in a situation to apply for it if we are not confined under a Territorial.  Thus you have my views and I pray God to sustain and uphold you and lead you right.  Mr Babbitt informed me in his last that if they gave us a Territorial Government at all they would send Pharaohs to rule over us. I have expressed my feelings to you in other Letters freely upon those points I am the same now  I wish to know if this reaches you in safety drop me  a line soon. I shall leave Here the evening of the 9th April via Phila I have altered my mind about the Northern parte as the lake is not clear. I had a good time with O pratt Wooolly shiped their goods on the shiped Boatnal I also shiped about 20 tons of goods and baggage on the ship with them pleae take good care of this sheet  Yours in the illegible of truth W. Woodruff.  Dr J M Bernhisel Wishingtin D. C. ENDENTRY Mr. Phippen  Sir believing you to be familliar with the word of God and considering you willing to instruct your inferiors uppon spiritual subjects, and after forming such conections of your character I take this method to ask ^you^ several questions for information and instructions as I have no other motive in view, and should you not consider it beneath your notice to answer my questions by writing but give me your opinion as you have formed it from the word of God it would be highly interesing to me  The 1th is respecting the gift of healing the sick casting out devils andc. 2th the Sabbath and its changes. 3th and last is the subject of babtism. Firstly, while perusing the sacred volumen of inspiration I find many wonderful works were performed by our Saveiour and likewise by the apostles though not by their own power but by faith in and through Jesus Christ and if I mistake mot when Christ first sent his disciples to preach the gospel which was to the lost sheep of the house of israel he commanded them to rase the dead cast out devils andc S. Mathew. chap. X Matthew 10 again in the last chapter of S. Mark Mark 16:14-18 Christ appeared to the eleven as they sat at meat and gave them a varry forcible command to go into all the world and preach the gospel to ev^e^ry creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover andc this apparently was the last command given by our saveiour before he assended to heaven. now the question that arises in my mind is when and whare were those gifts done away as some maintain that they are. I find no scripture satisfactory to prove that they ever were done away theirfore I am led to believe that God is the same to day as in ancient days and likewise should people at this day live as did the apostles and exercise the faith that did Isacc that those gifts might again be on the earth and in case of sickness we might loock to the Lord for deliverance in prefference of trusting to an arm of flesh. we read of a woman that was ill that had suffered many things of many Physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse which was finally healed by her faith in Christ. Luke 8:43-48 should light be held up to the world uppon this subject at the preasent day undouptedly their would be as little heed given to it as the Lord told Ezekiel their would be to his prophecy when he sent him to the house of israel, yet I ask your opinion uppon the subject for information  (the Lord sent Ezekiel to prophecy mowithstanding they would not hear and ought not light uppon this subject be held up even if it is not received) ENDENTRY secondly; with respect to the sabbath we allmost universally Regard the first day of the week as the sabbath, but when God appeared to mount he commanded him to keep the seventh day as the sabbath and not to labour on that day, ##Exodus 20:8-11## so it appears that  if their has mot been a change of the sabbath we as a body are not keeping the day that we ware commanded to keep still it is held up to view at this day that the sabbath has been changed, but is it mot allowed that their has mot been no change in any of those commands that were given to Moses at the time that the command of the bsabbath was given and why has the sabbath been changed while the other commands remain good and sacred and while we are under them and ought to obey them it is maintained ^by some^ that Christ rose on the first day of the week and that the work of Redempttion was greater than the work of creation and this they appear to consider as the change of the sabbath, but when we carefully peruse the writings of the four Evangelist respecting the resurrection of Christ does it not appear as reasonable to suppose that Christ rose on the seventh day as first, and even did Christ really rise on the first day of the week does that prove that it was a change of the sabbath and if the sabbath was changed by the resurrection of Christ would their mot have been sumthing said respecting that change so that the evidence would have been clear that the change of the sabbath was then perfected. sir this is a subject that has some length of time ocipied a seat in my mind and I lay it before you considering you have far deeper understanding of the word of God than myself and would wish to know your views uppon this subject as I have not understood the scriptures to be verry plain respecting the change of the Sabbath  the third and last is the subject of babtism and it is a subject to that has long lain with wait on my mind I think it not ownly our duty but our highest privledge to take the word of God and make it the man of our council and form our principles theirby still we may benefit by the instruction of those that are more experianced than ourselves I for one Consider myself transacting business for Eternity and I believe that Jesus Christ sat the example for the pilgrain to follow and I believe that the christian ought to strive to imitate his example as near as possible (allthough I for one come far short of it) I at times have been allmost overwhelmed in as^s^tonishment while meditating uppon the difference of opinion and principle that exist in our land uppon religious subjects when we have all the sane bible to read the same spirit to direct but more especially uppon the subject of babtism. my mind has long been seleled with regard to this subject still I have remained silent uppon the subject as I am of the opinion that evry person ought to be fully established uppon ^in^ principles uppon which much depends I had the ordanonce of infant babtism administered to me but it does not answer my mind for I have not found any scripture to support it from revelation ENDENTRY and if I may be allowed to use the expression it has been a mysterey to me how so many great divines that have been so long holding  up the light of the gospel and still continue in so gross an error with respect to babtism. for if I am not greatly mistaken I find no account of John or any of the apostles administering the ordinance  of babtism untill they become believers in Christ or at least untill they considered them true believers and that appeared to be all that was required of them in order to be babtized was to believe that Jesus Christ was the son of God and if they spiritually believed this they must be penitent believers and respecting the mode of babtism it appears plain to me that their is no room for one a moment to doubt but that our saveiour was buried in babtism in the river Jordan and that all that the Apostles babtized ware buried with Christ in babtism and setting aside evry other example but the one that Christ left us that alone ought to be sufficient to convince mankind that emmersion was the rite and ownly mode of babtism (to use the language of Dr Daddridge Jesus had no sin to wash away and yet he was babtized and God owned this ordinance so far as to make it a season of pouring forth the spirit uppon him and this ought to silence evry objection to the practice)  many advance the argument that those things are not escential but may we mot with the same propriety say that when Isaac that it was not essential whether he offered his son or a lamb out of his flock and who of decided virtue will admit that the Lord would have received Abrahams offering with a blessing and given a blessing in return had he offered a lamb in stead of his son, and why should any believe that infant sprinkling will be as acceptable in the sight of God for babtism as to follow the example that our saveiour hath given has not Christ plainly told us that he is the way ^the truth life^ and if mankind ever enter in to the kingdom of heaven must it not be by him ##John 14:6## isf so then ought we not to obey his commands and follow his precepts and not climb up some other way.  Mr Phippen as I am convinced of the mode of baptism, and believe it to be essential to my prosperity and happiness the information that I wish you to communicate to me respecting this subject is whether it is against your principle and discipline to administer the ordinance of babtism to those that you consider to be proper subjects without joining the Church for I at preasent am not prepared to unite ^join^ with any church still I feel it a duty to be babtized and would wish to take up the cross when I have a fair opportunity  I have premeditated a conversation with you uppon this subject but have delayed it as my brother is expecting to be babtized and I have rather been waiting for him. sir I have ^not^ intended any harm by asking those questions and I wish you to excuse all you see amiss in my remarks and by answering me you will confer a great favour uppon Willford Woodruff ENDENTRY Communication to George Phippin by Willford Woodruff Jan 1831 ENDENTRY My dear Brother.  I have but little spare time, But I will exppropriate these first few moments which I have been able ^to^ catch from my num erous calls–to answer your very interesting questions! Let me say to you I am please you took the liberty to propose them. I shall al- ways be ready to listen to any similar re- quests. But I hasten to my bussiness.  Your first question respects the Sabbath and its change.  GOD having finished his work of Creation in six days, ceased and rested therefrom on the seventh, and set it apart for the more solemn worship of him self by men. and as an emblem and pledge of their eternal blessedness. Gen II 1. 2.  The ancient Patriarchs observed the Sabbath. though we have no particular account of it.  The "End of days," when Cain and Abel offered their oblations and The day when the sons of GOD met together in Jobs time, doubtless were Sabbath days. Gen -IV. Job I - 6 and II. 1.  When GODs ancient people were fed with Manna from Heaven, in the wilderness, they were told that a double portion would fall on the day previous to the Sabbath which should be gathered and that none should be gathered on the sabbath for the Sabbath was the LORDs. Exodus. 16. 23 ENDENTRY Thus it appears that the Sabbath was most sacredly re- garded, before the moral law was given from Sinai. But to mark the perpetual and universal obligation of the observance of the Sabbath, GOD proclaimed the law of it from Sinai and wrote it in a table of stone, along with the rest which are allowed to be moral; Exodus XX 8-11. Injunctions to keep it and threatenings for the breach of it, are every where found in the law and the prophets.  The Sabbath is therefore of universal obligation. How is it changed from the seventh to the first day of the week?  In answering this question I would observe I. Man's moral obligation respects the seventh part of his time, rather than any particular day. It is not certain that the Godly before the flood, kept the same day which they kept after that event.  Nor is it certain that the same cronology was obser- ved at the giving of the law at Sinia–which had been observed before and after the flood.  But however Cronology might alter–A seventh part of the time would be the same in all ages.  II To honour his own ressurrection, Jesus the LORD of the Sabbath, changed the Sabbath from the seventh to the First day of the week.  To mark the devine authority of this change, he on that day, made repeated visits to his de- ciples - John XX. 19. 26. On that day he bestowed the mirac ulous gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost - Acts II - 1. ENDENTRY III This is called the LORDs day. The Psalmist in refference to the day on which Christ arose and to the whole day of the Gospel dispensation  says–This is the day which the LORD hath made let us rejoice and be glad therein.  John the Revelator calls the first day the LORDs day - Rev - 1 - 10.  IV The primitive christians met for public wor- ship and made their collections for the poor on the first day of the week. Acts 20. 7. Cor - 16. They also met on the evening of the first day of the ^week^ and their devine LORD repeatedly met with them.  I close these remarks by observing–That there is an alarming laxness among christian pro- fessors in keeping the christian Sabbath. and that we might all awake to righteousness, on this subject.  In answer to your second question ofn the  subject of miracles–I answer in general,  I. Miracles were wrought for a definite purpose in the Apostolic age–summari ly to establish the devine authenticity  of the holy religion of the blessed Jesus. That object has been accomplished. The evi dence arising from miracles a lone, is clear ENDENTRY convincing and overwhelming.  II If we should exercise strong faith in GOD, and live at the fountain head of holy influence that is–should we watch unto prayer, and  pray without ceasing–should we daily fear to sin and daily deny ourselves and take up our cross and follow christ–should all professors of religion persue this course–doubtless a wonderfull change would be effected at once in the state of the church. but even in that case I do not see that the church would have any authority to attempt to perform such miracles, as were performed in the Apostolic age.  They doubtless would shed their holy influence all around and be instrumen- tal in the conversion of thousands of souls– and the glorious Gospel would be spedily be preached to all who dwell upon the earth. For christians would feel that all they possessed is christ's and they would  most cheerfully devote themselves their time, talents, property, privileges, spirits, souls and bodyies– with their present all and all they ever expected–to the service of their dear LORD and Master. Let us pray fervently my dear brother, that  the LORD would hasten this glorious state of the church.  Then will the deciples of Jesus be instrumen- tal in performing as great or greater miracles than did the Apostles.  As it respects your III. Question. I would observe that it is in my view, always desirable that those who are baptized should join a church– an evangelical Church. But I am ready to baptize all persons who apply to me to  administer that ordinance–provided they give evidence of evangelical piety.  That the blessed saviour would direct you alway and into all truth and finally bring you to glory is the prayer of your friend and brother.  George Phippin.  Willford Woodruff.  Canton Janry 7 1831.

Woo^d^ruff.  Sir, your Letter of the 9th of March, dire- cted to Bishop Sidney Rigdon, ^and^ Hyram Smith, and the Saints in Zion, came safely to them, some day's since. aAnd on account of the press of business now on their hands, ^and the request of J Smith Jr,^ I have taken it upon me to answer it. You say, that you have heard of the deplorable state of things in Kirtland; and it gave me much Joy to learn by your letter, that you viewed those things in their true light. Great has been the afflictions of the saints in that place, particularly our beloved Brotheren Joseph Smith Jr, and S. Rigdon.  In the past summer; I Journeyed from this place in company with Wm Smith, and D. W. Patten, to Kirtland, for the purpose of meeting in conference those with the 12 ^twelve^. On our arrival, we soon learned the difeculties that then existed than: these however wase all appearantly settled, preveious by to my leaving Kirtland: And ^W^ Parish, who has since become  so 3 illegible words ^an unbeliever in the book^ ^of Mormon, reveiled religion, illegible,^ affected to repent and become sattisfied, with Br. Joseph and the Church. oOthers also did the same: But this settlement was not of long duration. Soon after this, President Hyram Smith and I, left Kirtland for the upper Missouri: and President Joseph Smith, President S. Rigdon, and ^Prest.^ Wm Smith, soon followed us to Far West: and during their absence, it seemes that ^Wr^ Parish, Luke Johnson, Joseph Coe, and some others, illegible ^united^ togeather in for the 2 illegible words ^repecting the procedings^ of the Church. President Smith and his company returned on or about the 10th of December; soon after which this 2 illegible words ^decenting^ band, openly, and publickly, renounced the Church of Christ of Latterday Saints, and claimed, themselves to be the old standard, called themslves the Church of Christ, excluded that of saints, and set at naught Br Joseph and the whole Church, denounceing them as Heriticks ENDENTRY How blind and infatuated are the minds of men, when once turned from Rigteousness to wickedness? They did not understand, that by taking upon them the name of Latter day Saints, did not do away that of the Church of Christ. Neither did they consider, that the ancient church, was the Church of Christ, and that they were Saints. And again, it appears that they did not consider the Prophesy, of Daniel, which saith; ^says^ "The saints shall take the Kingom" andc "Again, "the Kingdom, and the greatness of the Kingdom, under the whole Heaven, was given to the people, (the Saints) of the most High" andc And the Saints here alluded to, were certainly Latterday Saints; was much, as the above prophesy is to be fulfilled, in the Last days; and is yet future, as all professed readers of the bible will confess.  We have of late learned, that pParish, and the most rest of this 2 illegible words, ^combination^ have openly renounced the Book of Mormon, and becme deists. Kirtland, and give you some acount of the move- ment of things here, as they are and have been.  You, undoubtedly, will remember the visit, which I, in company with Elder Tennessee, in the summer of 1836. You also may reecollect, the nature and result, of our visit. We came to solisit assistance, for Poor bleeding Zion: And we obtained, through the goodnes of the Children of God, in those regeons, the sum of fourteen hundred and fifty dollars, which we delivered unto John Whitmer, on our arrival to this place. But these men, instead of laying out the money for the benefit of Poor bleeding Zion, purchased Land for their own emolument. They g^e^nerally did their business, independantly of the aid, or council of ^either^ the bishop or High Council. This gave some uneasiness to the 2 ^two^ author- ities of Zion: not only because they purchased land With Church funds, in their own name, for their own agrandisement, but because they selected the place of the City Far West and appointed the spot for the House of the Lord to be built on, drew the plan of said house, and appointed and ordained a committee to build the same, without asking or seeking council at the hand of either Bishop, High Council, or first presidency; when it was well under- stood that these authorities wer ^appointed^ for the purpose of coun- ciling on all important matters pertaining to the saints of God.  These two presidents also managed to get the town plott into their own hands, that they that they might reap the avails ariseing from the sale of the lots. In consequence of these, with many other things, the Council met by themselves on the 3rd day of April 1837, and resolved to invite the two presidents, the Bishop and his council, and the two apostles, namely T. B. Marsh and D. W. Pattatten, to meet with them, on the 5th inst. to which time they adjourned. Acordingly the above named authorities met, on the ENDENTRY 5th, and after lbouring dilegently three days in succession, it was unanim- ously agreed upon, that the town pPlatt, with 4 ^four^ eighties adjacent to the platt, should be at the disposal of the Bishop and his council the High Council, the two presidents, and the two apostles. During this labour the two presidents acknoledged they were wrong, and they to all appearance willingly suffered themselves to be corrected by the Council.  In the begining of May following, the Council again met, and resolved to to have the above m^n^amed property transfered into the hands of the bishop, as an equivalent to the Poor bleeding Zion money, and  that the avails, of said land, should be thareafter applied to the benefit of the poor, and other public purposes. The business of the transfer of said property, was transacted by the two presidents, the Bishop and his coun- cil, and by some meanes they managed to bind the bishop in a heavy mortgage ^of three thousand four hundred and fifty dollars^ to apply two thousand dollars of the avails of the town plat ^Which they had subscribed^ to the building of the House of worship, which they intended to build ^have^ erected; Since that time, the affair of building the house has falen through. Consequntly, many people have withdrawn ther subscription to it, and these two men, claining this two thousand dollars as their subscription, chuse to withdraw it, and put it into their own pockets. aA small part of which has been already paid to Wm W. Phelps.  The Council, not feeling ^willing^ that the Church should be defrauded of two thousand dollars of her public funds, and also know^ing^ that the Church in general as well as themselves, had become dissattisfied with their conduct as Christians, in many things, appointed a committee to labour with them: after which, they called the whole church in Zion togeather, who almost unanimously voted them out of their presidenceal office.  Not long after this, the Council saw cause to appoint a seecond committee, to wait on these men who still presisted in their opposition to the interests a page torn the Church. aAfter which, charges were prefered against them before the Council, which were substantiated, and they were excommunicated. Also, the Church has had much sorrow durring the past winter, on account of the unfaithfulness of O. Cowdry, Lyman Johnson, and in consequence of this, and Their opposition to our beloved Brother Joseph Smith Jr, and the best interests of the Church of Jesus Christ, ^On^ for presisting in the same, a number of Charges have been substantiated against them, before the Councils and bishop of the Church, and they have  also been excluded from fellowship. "How has the gold become dim the most fine gold changed"!!! But I must drop this subject for want of room. Suffice ^it^ to say Brethern, J. Smith Jr and S. Rigdon are now with us, the Church now flourishes, and the Saints rejoice, and the ^internal^ enemies of the Church are down. You will see by the above prospectes, that your anxious desires for the Journal are about to be granted.

May grace, preace, strength, faith and victory, rest upon you and Sister Richards from God our father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Dear Brother ^it^ is amid peculiar feelings that I take up my pen to address you this morning. I have so many things in my mind at this time that I wish to communicat and so little time and room to do it in that I hardly know whare to begin or how to End. I feel that there never was a store House ten story high filled from top to bottom with Merchantdize that cant have more of a variety in it than I have in my mind at this time. and I hardly know how to go to work to give you a description of my situation but I will try to do it by parible. figure, similee or sumthing or other. I am far from feeling vain vane or like trifling lent I take the Liberty of making expressions to you that I would not to the world, that you may ketch my view of the situation of things here. In the first place permit me to say that I never before witnessed such a scenery as I am Experiencing here neither did I every expect to in my generatoion. The Lord of Hosts is with me in power and sone some of the time the Devil to. I have had some mighty Battles with the devil sword in hand since I have been here and God has enabled me to give him a deadly wound and routed him out  of his camp and he has fled from me wounded and roaring like a Lion and I can hear the sound of his roar about 10 miles off and I expect him to return for an other Battle by and by for you are aware thant an Enemies camp cannot be brock up without some noise and so you can form sumthing of an Idea of it from the following description. I have been here 21 days preached 20 times and Baptized Mr Thomas Kington the superintendant of the preachers of the United Brethren, a branch of or broke off from the Methodist Church and with Mr Kington I Baptzed 23 preachers of the same Order that was under his superintendance and also I Baptzed 46 of the members of the same church making 70 in all, this scenery has committed into my hands and charge and my controll mostly 45 esstablished places of preaching most of which are licensed according to Law, and also 48 Preachers 24 of which I have already Baptzed and most of the rest are ready as soon as they can have an opportunity. as I said before I say a gain their will be a mighty harvest here for all the churches which these preachers are over are ready to receve the word. should I judge from outward appearances I should think their would spedily be 500 Baptzed in this region and probably more still I dont wish to count chickens before they are hatched. I am now Baptzing about 10 daiy daily day before yesterday 12 and yesterday 9 sone days I have to go in the water 3 time a day. I Baptzed 6 preachers yesterday and I have a number to Baptze to day. yesterday 3 preachers came in a charriot or Gig to visit me they never had herd me preach at all. I had on wet cloths and going to the pool to Baptze. I testified of Jesus Christ unto them the power of God rested upon us and they kneeled down and wept and prayed, and their Gig stood still and they all went down into the pool the same hour and I Baptzed them and they went their way rejoiceing and praising God. Mr Kington is an humble man I have Ordained him an Elder and I ordained two priest their will be many worthy labourers raised up in this country. you see by this time Brother Richards I am not Idle but have much to do and need much wisdom from God to do it well, for it is the strongest fishing ever I have done and I domt expect any thing els but while gathering the Salmon I shall get among them some ells and snakes for their has already been sone after they would were Baptzed that would pitch and Bound like a porpose or jump and roll like a hen with their head cut off manifesting every kind of spirit but that of order and if ever an Elder had any triming to do I expect to have my share of it by and by for in doing such a rapid work as this I have to become all things to all men for I cannot get time to do much triming as yet. in fact some have before I was aware of it ENDENTRY bounded into the water to me stark naked excecpting a loose cloth around their legs but I put a stop to all disorder as fast as possible. and again I am Having a mighty struggle against this Methodist power of falling down like a dead man stiff as a stake which is in some of the preachers as well as the people. I have to handle all these things in wisdom. among the number that I have and are Baptzing are some large farmers having 3 or 400 acres of land I have Baptzed sone constables as well as preachers. there is a Merchent in Hanly that we Baptzed that trade is so bad that he is wind ing up business and wants to go to Zion with the Saints. I have Baptzed most of his relatives here several Brothers and Sisters here he has come down to visit them he has said sumthing to them about it. and they all want to trans up business here and move with the Saints in the U.S.A. and in fact most all the Saints are getting the same spirit here without my preaching it. I do wish the Twelve would spedily come to England that we might hold a council somewhare about these and many other things. when you next write to me say a word to me what your mind is about this. the farmers here feel like this that bad times are coming and the sooner they can turn their property in to gold the better and in fact with the view I have of the  times I cannot advise them as yet to the contrarary. you begin to see Brother Richards that I must have much to occupy my mind at preasent considering what I have to do. and in addition to this I have just recceved a Litter from Elder Turley is  taken with a States warrent and put into Birmingham for an old Debt that Brother Turley contracted 15 years ago before he left England, or in other words Turley was in partnership with a man and when they dissolved Turley gave up the stock into his hands to seell and he supposed it was all settled but now the man claims that he did not sell the stock for as much as he expeted and that he has still claims On Turley. John Jones in Burslem was connected in taking him It is merely a trick of the Devil to stop his preaching but I believe the Lord will overturn it for Gdod how long he will be confined in prison I do not know. The whole Labour at the Potteries is now flung upon Elder Cordon and when he wrote me he was some out of health and should their be any faithful labourer at liberty would they not do well to go into that part of the vineyard and assist. And again in addition to this case I have a certain Brother Richards whome I love of a truth for the truths sake that dwelleth in him and I pray God that it may be with him forever and he asks an interest in my prayerrs in  his behalf and his companions that the Lord may manifest his will concerning them. I will now say Dear Brother I will gladly comply with your request the first leasure moments I can get, in fact I have attempted two or three times since I recceved your two Letters upon the subjet to lay the case before the Lord but no sooner than I would begin to pray some one would bye wraping at my door for me to go and baptzed them or for sumething els. in fact since I recceved your letters I have had no spare time hardly to pray for any thing, for you see how things are  with me and of course can judge how my time is taken up. I scarcely pass a pool of water but what sumbody is waiting there for me to baptze them. and in fact if John had more Baptizing to do when all Judea and Jerrusalem went unto him to be Baptzed, then I have had for a few days past he certainly had his hands full. But do not think dear Brother that I shall close this letter with out answering the questions you have asked me and expressing my feelings unto you No God forbid  not with standing I have not had time to lay your case before the Lord as I could wish, yet I have a word to express upon the subject. In the first place I wish to say I recceved your twoo letters and have read them over several times. and you speak my mind perfectly with regard to any other persons opening any of our letters excepting our own Qurorum. and when I gave permision for a letter to be opened should one come before my returned, I did not then expet to be gone but vary few days before my return and it was  under the impression that if I had a letter at all during my absence it would be from Brother Manchester, and as they wanted to hear from him I gave them that priv^i^lege with a charge to say nothing concerning the contents if their was any thing that the church should not know ENDENTRY but being gone longer than I expected Turley. But I have sent orders for no more letters to be opened that are sent to me. And with regard to the question you asked me on the scrap of paper. (I say yes let them eat or drink what they will in such cases) I should be pleased Brother Richards to hear from you often and give me all the news you have from any quarter I was pleased to hear of doors being opened in Scotland tell me whare I can direct a letter to Elder Mullenner in Scotland. also inform me of any information you get from any of the Twelve I wonder why they tarry so long in America may the Lord hasten them to his country. Also inform me concerning sister Richards health from time to time give my love to her and tell her I should be exceding glad to see her but when I shall get out of this part of the vineyard I cannot tell. pray for me Brother Richards that I may be meek and humble that I may fully overcome evry speces of pride and self wrighteousness that I may feel my dependence on God in all things, and that I may know the mind of God concerning me in all things. A word concerning you and Sister Richards. But what am I that I should teach or instruct thee or inquire the will of the Lord concerning thee. O that I was more worthy that I might greant thee the desire of thy heart in this this thing and that I might more fully know the mind of  God concerning myself and all things that are required at my hand that I might be more fully prepared to greant thee thy request. But if you can receive it at my hands I say unto you thus  saith the Lord let not my servant Willard Richards litely essteem his calling or station for I have called him and he is a chosen vessel unto me and no man shall ever do his work or take his crown. for he is humble and seeks my will, his afflictions shall work together for his good in the end, let him be not weary in commtting his case unto the Lord or trusting in my name and I will bring it to pass and the darkness shall pass away and the light shall come. and I page torn break the bands that bind him and liberate him from those under his charge for they page torn not worthy and some are under condemnation for litely essteeming the priesthood illegible whome God has set over them. Let him still call upon me in Mighty prayer and be not weary committing his companions and all his ways into my hands and I will work out his deliverance in a way that I have prepared, and he shall yet have many souls as seals of his ministry, and be mighty in council, and much beloved by his brethren the Twelve. Thus Dear Brother is the voice of the spirit concerning you and I would say to Sister Richards by way of council to try not to be discouraged nor desire to die but to live. though your afflictions may be great for a time yet consider what Jesus has bourn, commit all your ^ways^ unto the Lord you will ere long enter that rest that remains for the people of God then your morning will be turned into joy and you will be satisfyed with the goodness of  the Lord I feel as though the Lord will open a door whareby you will be liberated before many days I will pray for you before God that your faith fail not and that you may have grace and strength according to your day. whatever is manifested unto me I will endeavour to communicate it unto you from tine to time.

Preston Lancashire  stamp in red ink LEDBURY 1840  unknown writer WRichards  from W Woodruff– March 31 40  ENDENTRY page torn hole burned in paper Glostershire April 3rd 1840  Elder W. Richards  Dear Brother  I supposed you noticed that I did not answer any of your qustion in my last letter which you asked in March 27th the truth is I did not have time ownly to glance it over hastily and hurry since looked it over care fully I thought I would sit down and write a few lines more to you. I remarked to you in the last that I wished. you to come soon and labour with me awhile I did not as fully give my reason for the remark as I ought and should have done if I had room. But I would here remark that I did not make the request thinking that I had any power, desire, or wish to controll you. But Becaus it was the desire of my heart, and feeling that I need council and assistance for much depends upon the manner the field is governed here I want to hold several councils or conferences in this region and ordain officers in the different Branches Besides their will be many to confirm. I have confirmed about 100 and their will soon be another hundred to confirmed and I have just as much as I can do to preach and to Baptze daily without confirming. theirfore I stand much in need of some assistance and council in such a field. I have Baptzed about 40 preachers of the Unted Brethren primitive Methidist. and it has flung into my hands about 50 esstablished places of preaching which are licensed including one or two chapels. and you can see at once Elder Richards that it am overwhelming labour to be upon one man. and he needs his spirit sanctified and his Body Immortal to stand such a labour and it has put me at times to my wits ends to know what to do with so many places of preachings and preachers, But according to the Best wisdom I could get I could have pursued the following course I have finally told the preahers to continue to fill their appointments and teach righteousness and try to prepare the minds of the people for the fulness of the gospel, but not to administer in any of the ordinances of the gospel untill I can have some help and set in order the churches and ordain such persons as God shall call. the reason I have done this is the as soon as the preachers disappoint the  meeting and congregation those houses of worship will be shut up and sants might be shut out of the Kingdom that otherwise might come in tell me what your feelings are about such a course. I am well aware Brother Richards their is much to do in many places But it does appear to me that their is no field at present in England, whare your labour and council is more needed or would be of more benefit than to join me in this field a season. I have no controll at oll over you in this matter. But should consider it a great privilege and favor to labour together awhile you with you. If you can set in order your house and leave Sister Richards a season with some friends or friend, I think you would enjoy Bettr health here as it is entirey a farming country. Should you come will you please remember to Bring me the first No of times and Seasons and the Book of written Rev that I left with you and if you come by the way of the Wm Hulme in Rowley. I have written to Brothr Manchester, or the potteries churches felt to do any thing for him as you come along you could conveigh it to tim in Stafford as you pass though. If you can any way come soon I should be glad to see you I wonder why the Twelve do not come from America. I feel as though word ought to be soon sent for 20 or 30 or a whole quorum of the Seventies for I dont see when their will be a Better opportunity to prune England than the present. I Baptzed 13 the day that I wrote your letter 9 yesterday and many tomorrow and Sunday (Write after 1 pence a letter) If the Moon family gets ready would it not be well to give them a Recommendation and let them go. did the three families go from preston. should you be in Ledbury alone their is a lane neary opposite the Market house walk down that street by a tan yard 100 yards and enquire for Mullener I wondr what is the Matter of him whether he is under any transgressing or whether it is the devil desireing to destroy his usefullness I am inclined to believe the Latter let us pray for him that he may be supported untill some Elders come that one go to his assistance I think of writing him a letter to day as I have not yet I am now leaving all confirming for another time and shall appont meetings for that purpose and I pray God that you may be with me to assist me in it.

It is cheering to hear of the prosperity of  Nauvoo. It forcibly reminds me of the vision of Esdras in which he suddenly saw a woman in great trouble weeping with great lamentation but sud- denly there appe^a^red in her stead a great city. It will not take the Jews long to build Jerusalem at that rate.
