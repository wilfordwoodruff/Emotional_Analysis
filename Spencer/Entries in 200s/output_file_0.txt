I would just also remark that I lacked nothing on my journey as it regards my temporal wants, and had 50 cents left when I arrived at Fathers, and my purse is beginning to be replenished so that I shall be enabled to continue my journey in a few days. since at home I have had an interview with most of the Saints that belong to this small branch of the church.

I recieved your Letter at the hands of my brother and was truly glad to hear from you, was sorry however to hear of the ill state of your health as also that of your family, but how it will soon be improved. Wilford as you are aware is quite unwell, and we feel as  anxiety respecting him, as he is about to undertake such a journey. and it seems to me as tho’ I could not have him leave us so soon, but then, we know that God has  shall we worms of the dust say  to become a messenger from God to the nations of the earth. but still my natural feelings at times gain the ascendency and I can hardly reconcile myself to have him leave us. I need not say that W. is a brother that I set much by of  affections return with double force upon Willford.

I would ask no greater blessing than to be permitted to take up my residence with the Saints with the Saints at the west, I would be willing to undergo many earthly privations. I have felt as tho’ I should like it much could I be with you whilst W. is gone his mission, but I suppose it would not be considered consistent at present. but I do feel as tho’ I should be permitted e'er long, to stand on Mount Zion with the blessed company. pray for me Sister, that I may live in such a manner as to be accounted worthy to escape the just judgments of God abroad in the land, and finally have a standing given me with the saints of God. I have been quite unwell most of the time since W. has been at home and consequently have not received as much pleasure in hearing him converse upon this Latter day work, as I otherwise should have done. but we have had a very pleasant with him, and shall remember it with much pleasure. the greatest complaint I make is that I have not had scarcely any apportunity of conversing with him myself.

I often felt that I was alone,  a stranger in a strange land sick and ill provided for with my little Sarah clin ging around me as though she had no other friend to look to for protection &amp;  not knowing how it might turn with me would often cause me peculiar feelings,  but I would often look back and ask myself the question did I leave my fathers  house for the sake of honour, ease, or popularity, I think I did not but for the word of  God then I would try to be reconciled to my situation but I found it to be verry  hard work in the situation that I then was in— once I had a kind Willford to cheer  me in my lonely hours, but then I had none. I lived in my house about 2  months and quite as long as I wished in the situation that it was then in. Father  Clark learned the situation that I was in he invited me to go to his house  and spend the winter with ^then^ Sarah and my cow and calfe, and when I felt able  to sew some for his family I accepted the invitation and am here now, in the  spring he asked me to stay untill fall I have concluded to do so as they are building  houses for the wives of the 12 in Commerce I shall probably  the fall I have flattered myself that I should have my Willford to help me move  then, as I have moved 4 times since you left.

Orleans was covered 10 ft. deep with water and it was still rising and that Nathces was entirely destroyed by a a whirlwind) I have the chills and fever yet. There is a general conference appointed in P.W.   May 28     In Care of Alford Cordon. Clubbuildings. Navigation road. Burslem Staffordshire England One Sheet onely, Single Letter   May 9   Answered         ENDENTRY    I have just sent a full sheet to  the office for you and think I will begin another now and  keep a kind of a journal or sketch of times and things with me  untill I hear from you again. Today we have had a good meet ing at father Clark’s where I live and just as meeting closed  brother Smoot rode up to the door this is the first time. I have  seen him since his return from his mission— he has been  gone about 4 months and been into the states of Alabama &amp;c. and has baptized in company with br. D. Webster about 26 and or dained him an elder and given him charge over the church in  Ten. about 200 miles from where you traveled— br Smoot took  supper with me and I think you would have been a welcome guest  at the table he says that br. Webster has got to be a workman and  thinks of returning to Con. in march and settleing up his busines  and comeing west as soon as he can. 26 comfort myselfe with thinking that W. will come home and sure  ly he will not get away so again without I go to— you speak  about Willford’s growing fast so as to go into the vinyard, I think  he will be large enough by the next time you want to go so you  can take him along at least I want you to. 27 had a tried day my babe has been verry sick he still has the chills  and fever verry hard and today I got quite alarmed about him his fever ran so high but at night he is better I have broke his fever  4 times with Sappington’s pills but it will return. 28 I have felt quite comfortable my babe has been considerable smart. I thought I would write you a little every night just before I  retired to rest and let you know a little of the occurrences of the  day with me. 29 toward paying for a pair of shoes as I am much in want of them I  feel badly thried in mind, W. says I should like to know what it is  about well I will tell you when you come home, 30 today I feell some  better and finish my vest as I make slow progress in tayloring with  my babe and other chores 31 committing my case to my heavenly father he has taken it into his hands and  will do wright about it, I am makeing a cap for Ezra Clark, Willford continues  better  ENDENTRY  is a branch of the church here of about 50 members my name with Sarah Emma  &amp; W branch has gone to Commerce today and says that I must preside over the  meeting today— there are a number of elders here and I would like to have some  of them take your place a while and let you be at home with me and Willford  Owen, O poor little  tell me Willford why she was taken from me when you was gone it seames some  times that I can hardly help murmering at it— she was the was the pride and  joy of my heart in my lonely moment and her sweet disposition rendered her lovely  to all around her— Willford Owen is not near as pretty as she was — just befor she  died she left a kiss with me for her pa, pa. I had like to have forgotten to tell you that  on the 29 tioned haveing received a communication from you dated july 10 they have received  3 letters from you— they have lately had news of uncle Springfield  he died about the middle of Sept. I think with the billious fever— as Eunice said her  mother was writing to you I suppose she will give you the particulars of his death  Eunice is not diffident about her connexion with br. Webster she writes verry plain  to me on the subject— says she feels as though she was writing to a sister.  She says uncle Ozem will probably move west in the course of a year or two— she  appears strong in the faith.   to you safely I therefore leave my breakfast partly eaten and  commence to write a little more in my letter thinking that  apart of a sheet will be better than none ^to you^ if your feelings are  like mine in regard to hearing from you— my health and  Willford Owen’s is good this morn. I dont know as you like  the addition of Owen to his name but sister Smoot much desired  it. I told you in my last letter which I mailed about  ten days since that I would send you the minutes of the  conference in it but as I have not got them and suppose that  brother Thompson will send them I defer it. I have not  received the papers from you should be much pleased to—  We have just received the Sept. paper it contains the most  of one of your letters and little Sarah death in it and I hope you  will get it by the bearer of this.

I suppose that all  of the sisters in bearer of this  they are all well I believe I mentioned in 2 or  3 of my letters to you that if you could get me a black  lace wrought veil and a wrought lace cape and collar  I should be much pleased as they are much cheaper there  than here but if not convenient let it go. I really  hope you will get my letters for I took the utmost  pains to write to you I am comfortable here now  br. William Clark that wrote in one of my letters to  you says if want any thing to call on him which  I shall do but believe me when I say that the families  of those in Eng. mostly need them at home I th damage but dont tell that I wrote any thing about it damage it should cause uneasiness.

Her sacred dust, refined, again shall rise,  to shine in bliss most exquisitly bright,  Surpassing far the sun’s refulgent light.  And is she dead? O no! She entered life  the moment she escaped this world of strife: She’s now from earth removed, her soul expands,  And by the throne in holy rapture stands;  Expanding still, she drinks the blissful streames,  And basks  Now hears with wonder the melodious strain,  And joins to celebrate Mesiah’s name;  Her mind illumined now with glad surprise,  Sees happier worlds, unseen from mortal eyes.

The friends flock around to hear  your letters and seam much inter ested in them. I send them to  Joseph to read as he wants to  see them. Perhapse you may  think that I have forgotten to  tell you anything about our little  Willford Owen, O no, for he is now  in my lap pulling &amp; scratching  round so that I can hardly write.  he has just ^torn^ up the almenack before  I saw what he was doing, he grows  finely considering the sickness he has  had, has been sick much of the time  since he was born, he has the chills &amp;  fever now. He is now reaching  and trying to get my pen I will  give it him and see what he  will write. Dear pa pa do come  home and see me I want to see you  Dear wants to see you to, she often  cries about it. W. O. Woodruff.  Thus he has written some to his  pa pa himself  said that fools and children tell  the truth— Enough of this.—  I have thought of not writing to you  any more for two reasons one is  I fear that you will not get them  and another is I heard that our letters  were oppened before you get them by a set of men, but I trust your good sense will  cause you not to have my weak letters exposed for they are designed for no eye but yours.  I have received all the letters you mentioned haveing written and they have affor- ded me much satisfaction, &amp; sometimes I get quite lonely and disconsolat then the reception of  a letter cheers me up and I live hopeing that the time will come that you may be retu- rned home once more, this is the 8 N.Y. I regret verry much that you do not get more of them. My health is comfortably good— I was verry glad yours was so  good. We hear that brother P. P. Pratt has taken his family to Eng. But brother Joseph does  not approve of it I hear.  When I commenced this letter I thought I would keep  a little kind of a journal untill after the conference on the 2 ference though from the beginning I will give you some items of it as my mem ory serves me and in my next letter will coppy the minutes as you do not get the papers  should have done so now but Brother  yet— The  of bad weather they did not meet 3 ENDENTRY  voted that Kirtland should be built up and  over it I think  —then it was motioned that a committee be appointed and commissioned to  appoint &amp; lay up stakes for the gathering ^from Lyman Whight  and Judge Higby were chosen— then they proposed building the Lord's  house by tytheing the people they commen^ce^ to collect materials this fall and begin to  build next spring— the people meet togather and work every tenth day  br.

Smith &amp; one more were appointed for the committee – the house  is to 100 feet by 120 and much other business was done the meeting closed  by an address from Dr. Bennet (a quarter master general who has lately been  baptized) upon the subject of war. And by his talk you wo^u^ld conclude  that the brethren expected war with Missourie sometime – he is a great orator.   there was 5000 people on the ground. I shall not particularize the business of  this day or the morrow for my babe was quite troublesom which took my at tention much, 5 hood but his health would not admit of it so A. Babbit took the stand and  delivered an interesting discourse upon the same subject.— yesterday brother Joseph spoke  a short time from ##1 Corinthians 15:29|29## verse of the 15 chap. of first Cor. of which I will here after speak &amp; this afternoon brother L. White spoke on the same subject which was very interes ting. To-day we hear that brother Turly and his company are within 2 or three days  journey of here, and I stopped a week, to see them expecting to hear from you by then  spent most of the time with sister Kimbal she sends her respects to you—  She and family are well likewise sister Young She was not verry  well but was getting better, Vilate have been sick but are better— sister  Turleys family's also  sister Woodruff is comfortably as to health but her babe is not well. It has got now to be  the 15 sentences are verry broken but if you knew how I have to write you would not think  it strange, for I often have to leave my pen every minute and take the babe ^and^  write with him in my lap so that I make but poor headway about this business,—  although my sentences are more broken &amp; disconnected than they otherwise would  by reason of my little son, I do not consider it any task to take care of him and  presume you will excuse me for these reasons and to ask the Lord to spare him for  future usefulness and for a comfort to his parents.— I feel that without my babe I  should be miserable indeed – yes much more lonely than  much I miss little  fortitude, I have had almost one scene of trouble since you left me by sickness &amp;c but  I ^feel^ as though they were all light afflictions when compared with that – O pray for  me Willford that I may have grace and strength equal to my day - for I feel like a  lonely child on the earth now but I endure it as for Christ sake knowing that nothing  but a sense of duty to our heavenly ^father^ would cause us to part with the enjoyment of each of  each others society; but I will try to be patient and take as good care of our little lad as I can untill you return, which I pray God may be soon, for it seames that you  have been gone an age,—  Only ^think^ most 15 months, do tell me something about when  you think of comeing  conference, it hend 3 days and closed on the 5 spending a week in Commerce - We had a verry interesting conference and often did I  wish that  I hear that the brethren have commenced to draw stone for the meetinghouse. Now a few  words from Brother Joseph sermon on the living’s being baptized for the dead that they  may be judged according to men in the flesh; he has learned by revelation that those in  this church may be baptized for any of their relatives who are dead and had not a   grandparents, uncles, &amp; aunts,— but not for acquaintances unless they send a mi nistering spirit to their friends on earth,— as soon as they are baptized for their  friends they are released from prison and they can claim them in the resurrection and bring them into the celestial kingdom— this doctrin is cord^i^ally received by the church  and they are going forward in multitudes, some are going to be baptized as many as  16 times— they have to be baptized and confirmed separately for every friend— once  in one day— How many can a spirit be baptized  to do it for them— John Wesly can receive this work but how can his spirit be  baptize in water— It is the privilege of the oldest one in a family to be baptized  for their friends if they desire it but they can give it to another if they choose  Brother Joseph makes this doctrin look verry plain and consisten— he  has been bringing strange things forward to the church this season— strong  meat— he has delivered a course of lectures this season which were verry  interesting— I could not attend only apart of the time but often wished you  could be present—  he says that the throne of God stands on the earth like this earth  only it is cleansed &amp;c &amp;c— says that this earth is the wickedest planate that ever God made  and that its inhabitants  that it was the largest when made but at different times there has been parts  taken from it, for instance when the ten tribes were lost and says they will ENDENTRY  died and was raised to life again— says the beasts that he fought with at Epesus often  killed him and he came to life again— if so Willford why may not our little  Sarah be raised to life again— He, brother Joseph has brought forth many new  things this season.— There has been quite a number of deaths in Commerce  the past season I believe letter to you Seymour Brunson, he was buried under armes—  brother D. Patten was calling him and desired brother Joseph to let him go for  he needed him— likewise bishop wife is married again to  Mother Beanam— father  Joseph Smith the patriarch a little previous to his death he called his children around  him and blessed them and appointed Hiram Patriarch in his stead— There are  many things I have mentioned in my other letters to you which would be  interesting to you which I could mention if you have not received them.  such as some of the brethren’s going among the Indians, I saw two of them  on the 2 there was an Indian his wife and daughter baptized in Commerce.— I have  not heard from Connecticut since I wrote you last. - Did you  know that Dwite Webster  came here in june and went to the south with brother Smoot &amp;  expects to spend the winter in Ten. brother Smoot has ordained him an  elder and given him charge over the churches there, he makes great pro ficiency in the ministry— brother Smoot has got home and with his wife sends  his respects to you Sister Smoot says to tell brother Woodruff not to forget my hymn book  and while you are thinking of hers remember that I have no hymn book or bible.   with some other elders and there has been quite a stir among the people there again  and there has about as many come into the church lately us when you was  there— sister Jane Herrett say give my respects to br Woodruff I have lately had  a letter from her— I have lately seen sister Bently she that ^was^ sister Pattin she says  give my love to brother Woodruff and tell him he knows that I love him with  all my hart, her health is poor and she desires the prayrs of all that quorum  that it may not turn with her as it did with brother wife in her  last day but that she may be spared through it and do good on the earth she wants that little portrait of brother Pattins which you have as she has n   if you page torn can get me a wrought black lace veil I should like it much and page torn cape and collar I should be much pleased as they come much cheaper thepage torn  here. The families of the 12 have rather snug times to get along here— brother  Kimball was a wise man to build his house and get his family into it before he  left them. I have seen Eng I  have forgotten her name they were from Preston they have seen you all.  I was glad to see them. I read some of your letters to them they were  much pleased with them. Please give my respects to brother Kimbal and  all the quorum that are there likewise all the saints around you.    could dispute it reasonably and I should be glad to be baptized for my grandparents  and some others but want to wait for you to do it would it not be best, I had ra ther you would do it than any person living.— Sister Swasey one of my good  neighbours sends her respects to you and says tell brother Woodruff that she wants  him to come home for my sake. I am now at father Clarks and think I shall  stay here untill you come home. I am comfortable here and if I want any thing  can call on brother William Clark who wrote to you in my other letter makeing  a covenant with you that he would supply my needs and wants untill you  come home, He is a fine young man— belongs to the 70s and is father Clarks oldest  son at home he know you and says he is some acquainted with you— therefore  give yourselfe no uneasiness about my temporal wants but give me and our  babe an interest in your prayrs.

Sister Kimbal received some very pretty presents I saw  them when I was there they (like me) thought much of them; more on account  of their comeing from their husbands – If you could get some articles of clothing for  your family it would be quite acceptable— the sister who gave you the bed in N. Y. apostatized in about 2 weeks after so sister Stone told me from N. Y. Sarah  Milliken is not married yet but expects to be to a man out of the Church she  is in Commerce.— Aphia Woodman has sent a letter to Sarah Milliken asking  her advice and mine about coming west with Milton she is about 60 miles east of  father Carters with her brother - Milton has lately sent here to know who of the  brethren are going to Eng. this fall and when they will be in N.Y. so it appears that  he is thinking of going but there are none who are thinking of going from here this  fall, I hear that brother Joseph dont think it is best for them to go. Brother Johnathan  ENDENTRY  bought a steamboat and have got it running on the river— they gave 4000  dolls. for it.

I let brother Smoots 8 days after you left then she came home well  about 2 weeks and then I was taken with the fever and ague 3 or 4 days before she was. we were then in Montrose and no one to do any thing for us as they were all sick about there so that brother and sister Smoot came out and mooved us to their house and rendered us every assistanc they could although their house was unfinished yet our accommodations were much better than in Montrose. we have been quite low having had a shake every day but are both getti ng better now. I was much rejoiced to hear of the improvement of your health after you left by a man who saw ^you^ about 40 miles from here who said that you requested him to call and see me. I was glad to hear from you any way. much wonder that you do not write as you have always done before I think that you have not time or the letter has miscaried or something has happened. so good night my Willford hopeing that I shall feel better in the morn. The morn has come and found me for the first time without a chill or shake although I feal verry weak yet I think that I am gaining health and Sarah to. The men have come to day to raise my house I am in hopes that they will get it finished by the time that I am able to go into it their has been some talk of sister Tailor’s going in with me as she had to move out of brother Youngs house she went into my room with sister Pratt while I am out here. Sister Taylor wants to come out into this neighbourhood she is a good neighbour. but the family you left with me  should have dwealt there I should have sent for you to have come home for I could not have staid in the house with any contentment— but thank the Lord I have not for the f since you left but desired and prayed for your spead and success on your mission, Yea that you might have strength both temporal and spi ritual wisdom grace knowledge humility and understanding to pres erve you from all evil and help you fill your mission in the love and fear of God and have many souls as seals of your ministry   ENDENTRY  shall behold and embrace him whom I now feal to dedicate to the Lord know ing his calling although  make to be deprived of the society and company of my nearest friend on earth but I think that the grace of God is sufficient for all things even to raise me from a bed of sickness and preserve me ^and Sarah^ untill thy return which is my sincere desire. Oh! Willford do not forget ^us^ when at the throne of grace for we need  enough well people in Montrose to take care of the sick therefore they suffer for want of attention—much the same in Commerce although some have died there—and none in Montrose save a number of children brother Pratts was one of the number— well when you left. There have about 53 of the brethren died in Quincy and it continues verry sickly there yet— brother Lane has lost both of his children. brother wife is dead some of your Southern acquaintance—brother Jeremiah Murphy has been here from Tennessee and wishes to be rem^e^mbered to you. I suppose that you have learned the fate of our Island friends as I heared that you went through Rochester was glad that you had an oppertunity of seeing them. I received a book of brother Springfield with your marke or my name on it. was glad even to see that I received a letter from home the day that you left home. the^i^r heath was generally good accept sister Foss who was quite feeble and had been for 2 months in consequence of lifting the old gentleman who lived with her in his last illness he died last April. they sent much love to you and the letter was d^i^rected to you. they much wished you ^to^ call brother N.Y. they feared that you would not know that he was there. did not know that we had a paper from him. they wanted me to come home and stay with them while you was gone. they wanted you to call there on your return from England— Sister Foss would be much pleased with a letter from you. do write me once a month for they will seam long. I found the last page in your journal and read it with interest. hope that you found a lock of my hair with some lines in your trunk. Sarah sends a lock of her hair to you with a kiss by kissing the letter.  you have an oppertunity to get some wooling undershirts they would be much better for you. I have been weighting to receive  but feared if I weighted longer you would not get it before you left N.Y. ENDENTRY  N.Y. wish you could have spent the time at home. I would have written you a few of my sick bed reflections but do not feal able. Sister Smoot &amp; Jemima wishes to be remembered to you. they with  shown us every kindness in every kindness in their power. Sister Taylor and and her little girl are quite sick.

I was truly glad that you recei ved that letter you spoke of that I sent you in march for I conclude you must feell verry an^x^ious to hear from home judging you by myselfe for if I do not get a letter from you of ten I get quite uneasey — this is the 7 taken much pains to write you since you left home and much lament that you have  not received my letters, for I have written them verry full and one was a long sheet like your mamoth sheet-filled full, I wrote you once in Jan. then in Mar. then in Apr. then  in May then June then July then this in Sept — the April letter I sent by brother O.

I  have received them all and they brought much news, and afforded me and others much satisfaction for all the brethren and sisters seam anxious to hear from Eng. and I with them rejoice with you much in the prosperity of the work with you and that the Lord is  blessing you labours and the brethren’s there - The work rolls on there swiftly but the  time of your absence seames long to me it is 13 months today since I last saw you and it seames  to me to be almost an age but I will try to wait patiently your return which I know will be as soon  as the Lord^’s will^ is done with you there and did I not know that the Lord required you to be in his vine yard I could not endure your absence but the Lord has promised strength equal to our day  and I find he has fulfilled that promis to me, for I have been enabled the most of the time to be contented and reconciled to my situation although I have had much sickness and a  severe trial to pass through in looseing my little Sarah even in the absence of her father the little  dear had no relatives to follow her to her grave but her mother and little brother whome she tenderly loved,  it was a peculiar trying scene for me, more so because of your absence she did not forget her pa,pa,  for she used to call him many times in a day, but I trust she rests from the toils and  troubles of this life.

I wrote you a long letter while in potteries, but whether it has fallen into your hands or not I do not know. You have been anxious No doubt to hear from me from time to time, &amp; I have been equally as anxious to hear from you, but I do hope that you have not been as much disappointed in your desires in this thing as I have in mine for though I have written to you as often as once a month since I left home, yet I have not seen the first mark of your pen but once since I last saw you, &amp; then you &amp;  &amp; you must realize that my desire has been vary great to hear from you Sisters Turley &amp; Clark both wrote to their husbands &amp; their letters arivd safe &amp; I was in hopes to have herd a word about you some way but in this I was also disappointed, I do not make these remarks wishing to cast any reflections at all for I presume you have written several Letters to me since I left home but they must have been lost by the way somewhere. But I want you still to continue to write to me often for I may obtain some of them. I want to hear from you &amp; little Sarah vary much. I continued Labouring in Staffordshire about the Potteries untill the first of March when I left the church in that place in the care of Elder Turley numbering nearly one hundred &amp; I went into the South part of England about 80 miles from the Potteries or whare the word had been preached at all &amp; I made a stand near Ledbury in Herefordshire. it is about 40 miles from Bristol, 100 from  Working &amp; the Lord worked with me in a wonderful manner I first stoped at Mr John Benbows a large farmer he was cultivating 5 or 600 acres of Land. his Brother William Benbow went from the potteries with me to his Brothrs I expect you will soon see him in Montrose for he has gone to America &amp; will call upon you. I arivd at John Benbows on the 5 his house on the 5 on the 6 I preached on the 8 9 10 13 16 20 21 I Bap 4, two preachers 23 24 27 28 I Baptzd 2 one a Methodist preacher 29 I Baptzd 13. several were preachers 30 I Baptzd 9, five were preachers 31 April 2 4 5 I Baptzed 9 three were preachers 6 &amp; one Clark of the Church of England 8 9 tha fell upon me from a mob 10   Liverpool stating that the Twelve had just arivd from New York &amp; I must come immediately &amp; meet with them in conference at Preston &amp; so I left this part of the vineyard &amp; travled 160  miles to Preston &amp; attended a conference with the 12 &amp; the church in general  &amp; had an interesting time. I was truly happy to meet our Brethren from America &amp; immediately after the conference I returned accompaned by Elder  W. Richards will soon join us in this vast field that  is now open before us I never have seen such a vast field for labour as the Lord has enabled me to open where I now am since the church was first established either in America or England. I preached here one month &amp; 5 days &amp; baptized the superintendant of the Church of the United Brethren &amp; about 45 Preachers of the same order with about 120 of the members making about 160 in all, &amp; this senery has flung into my hands or under my care &amp; superintendancy more than forty esstablished places of preaching which are licensed according to Law including one or two chapels &amp; their is now about 200 ready to be baptized as soon as an opportunity offers I have Baptized some   here of most classes rich as well as poor. a Number of large farmers I have Baptized from 8 to 13 the first time I have preachd in several places The Lord of Hosts has been with me &amp; much of the convinceing spirit of God has accompaned the word. The whole country was immediately stired up. the Ministers  ormed held a council upon the subject to stop me in my preaching &amp; also the work one of the Church Ministers called upon the constable of the parish to take me up but he called upon the wrong man for he had recievd my testimony &amp; I had baptzed him. but as they cannot stop me by either the Law of the Land or the word of God, I have been  they offer to Baptize those of their own church if they desire it this is done thinking to save them from joining us for I have baptized a number of their ^members^ churches. I have had vast congregation out to my meeting both priest &amp; people. their will spedily be a mighty work in this country I think there ENDENTRY  here &amp; the work if but just begun to human appearance Elders Richards, &amp; myself will continued in this part of the vineyard untill we have secured the grain which is ripe for the harvest the work is rooling rolling on in every part of England where the word is faithfully proclamd we have sent the Minutes of our Conferene to the Editors of the Times &amp; Seasons &amp; you will see by that, that we are about to publish a Hymn Book &amp; also a Monthly periodical Elder Manchester which will be his place of abode for the present, Edinburg the capital of Wright have Baptized about 40 in Scotland. Heber C. Kimble is well &amp; will visit the churches which he has formerly built up &amp; then thinks some of going to Herefordshire, Hadlock is well &amp; going to the North of England Eldr Clark is  getting better. Eldr Turly is well as to health but last I herd from him he was preaching to the spirits in prison for he has been confined in Birmingham under pretene of Debt but it was to stop him from preaching, as soon as I herd of it I went to see him &amp; carried him some provisions &amp; money so that he should not suffer. he has friends now that are administering unto him so he has what he needs I expect he will soon be liberated he is preaching to the prisoners &amp; some want to be Baptzed I saw two men hung at the gaol the day I went to visit him. Elder Tayler is well &amp; has just recievd a letter from Sister Tayler which said that you was well &amp; I was exceding glad to hear it I do not know when the Letter was dated but I Believe in  in America since I arived in Sarah Foss &amp; William Benbow Left Liverpool a few day since for commerce I did not know that he was going so soon I had no chance to see him before he went if  other small articles their is much of the spirit of gathering with the Saints in this Land John Benbow has sold his property to the amount of about £1,500 &amp; wants to go as soon as the Lord will. I have had some scenes here some like ancient times soon after I commencd preeching in Ledbury or Herefordshire the Sound spedily went abroad &amp; thee Ministers or preahers came more then 20 miles in a gig to see me &amp; inquire into thes things they never had herd me preach or any of our people &amp; when they came to the house whare I was I had put on a change of clothing to go to the pool to baptzed a preacher that had  room whare I was &amp; I asked them what their business was with me. they said they had come to learn who I was &amp; who had sent me &amp; what message I had for them &amp; the people. I then stood up &amp; taught them Jesus Christ &amp; the first principles of the gospel &amp; testified of the Book of Mormon &amp; the great work which God had set his hand to accomplish &amp; while I was yet speaking the spirit of God rested upon us &amp; bore testimony unto them of the truth of my words &amp; they bowed down &amp; prayed &amp; gave glory to God for his marvelous work &amp; they rose up &amp; the Charriot stood still while all four of these preachers went down into the pool &amp; I Baptzed them &amp; lade my hands upon them &amp; they recevd the Holy Ghost &amp; went their way rejoiceing. I went into the town of Ledbury to preach for the first time &amp; as soon as the people herd that I was in town they gathered together in companies wanting to hear, the Baptist Minister offered to open his Chapel for me &amp; he went into the pulpit with me &amp; opened the meeting by reading the 35 chapter of Isaiah &amp; praying mightyly for the Lord to bless me &amp; make me an instrument of doing much good after which I arose &amp; preached to ENDENTRY  an hours notice many appeared Believing, the Baptists Minister gave me his hand &amp; bid me God speed, aftr meeting I Baptized 13, ^next morning^ &amp; the Lord is opening many doors upon the right &amp; left.

I have not heard  from you since last july or your letter was dated th 6 mentioned brother Turley’s return home and mentioned writing and sending me some things by him he had not arrived  expected daily as we heard he had left N.Y. with his company for Montrose but it was getting so late in the season that we dared not wait any longer  so I borrowed 15 dolls. of sister Taylor and  Kimbal to take charge of the things you sent until our return and to pay ENDENTRY  any and left word to have your letters forwarded to me in Maine I feel  verry anxious to hear from you more so since you went to London.  I feel verry thankful that the Lord has blessed you in your ministry in the  maner that he has since you have been gone from home but Oh! how long  you have been gone sometimes my heart almost sinks within me when I  think how long you have been gone and the scenes that I have passed through  since you left me and was I to dwell upon it I should sink beneath it but hitherto the Lord has supported me. do tell me when you think  you will be at home the next time when you write if you ca often get quite impatient weighting your return. Could I have taken  our little Sarah east with me it seames as though I should have been  happy but Ah! I had to leave her remains in Commerce while I went  east with my little Willy but not without first visiting her grave and strew ing it with leaves, but I leave this subject. The church in Commerce  and Iowa is increaseing verry fast  the church which are bad but  you come home which I hope and trust will be in the spring and  hope you will be prepared  although I expect my friends will be opposed to my going back and  that was the greatest and only objection that I had to going home perhapse  they may change my mind upon the subject but I hope not. I want you to  write often for I think you do not feel as lonely as I do. Father Clark’s  family have been verry kind to me ever since I have been there and they  wish to be remembered to you. I have sent you as many as eight or nine  letters since  sorry that you do not get them. I have not received any papers from you  in Eng. should be much pleased to read them hope you will bring a coppy  of them home with you and some hymbooks. I have lately received a letter  from sister Eunice they were well—father Carter’s family are well—  I should be glad to call on father Woodruff’s family as I go along but  shall not have time as it is so late in the season. I should be glad  ENDENTRY  tunity to call on them neither should I know where  to find them. I must write a line to sister Eunice  so that I must close by wishing to be remembered by Willford   to all the American brethren and all the Saints around  you likewise particularly brother Kingstons family I should  be glad to fill this sheet but cannot for want of  time.

I passed by brother Stephen Luces’ where the brethren have met for meeting—thinking I would spend the time in writing to you. Brother Ball arrived here last eve. and brought me a billet from you to day which I was glad to receive. The church here are strong and well engaged likewise the opposers are engaged to. Mr. Carter has held two mock meetings here of late, he has a written manuscript which he has been collecting through the past winter from newspapers &amp; hymns addapted to the occasion. brother Ames and Valentine attended the first meetting and bore a noble testimony for the truth they said they never had so much liberty in speaking before, many people saw the contrast between the two spirits—but none of the brethren attended the last meeting. I have received three letters for you but no papers; one letter was from Mother  Woodruff bearing date of Dec. 31 that she has been quite sick but has far recovered also that father were well and that her faith was encreaseing in the faith of latter Day Saints and that nothing short of it would satisfy her mind &amp; brother Asahel wherein he acknowledges the reception of your last letter—his remarks are more favourable than  he heard brother Terra Haut last fall &amp; was from brother Milton he mentions that your much esteamed letter came to hand and was gladly received—he had concluded almost that you had not received his—he likewise received one from Kirtland the same day dated Jan. 14 ENDENTRY  Sidney took their families Saturday night and it is supposed they have gone to Missourie and the word is for all to follow that possibly can to escape the destruction that is comeing upon K. There is a great division there and a number have left the church and raised what they call a standard of truth and liberty and drew up a remonstration against wickedness and the pro cedings that have been illegal bible  J. F. Boynton and Joseph Coe and Aphia, and many others but I hope not Willford and Phebe—there was about thirty five that signed the remon strance, but the letter stated that there was thousands of the same opinion. The Cowd ry has withdrawn from the church, the printing office has been taken and sold for Joseph’s and Sidney’s debts N. Milliken have the papers at present. I am verry sorry for that for there is much eccitem ent excitement here already about the delay of the papers and I suppose that they have the same account here in the papers that you saw, some of them have already written to the Post Masters in Cleaveland and Kirt. to learn the truth of these things although it is kept private here now. O Willford what is this world comeing to. my heart almost shrinks within me when I look around on the state of things. Brother Ball has received a letter from his Boston requesting him to return to them and he thinks of starting in 8 or 10 days. I rather expect that he will baptize Mr. Lucy Fry as they have been waiting for an oppo- rtunity most ever since you lelft. Brother Ames has had his case tried and the cost was trown upon him. Mr Douglass has been in a great rage about you he says that he will spend all his property in law with you but that he will have his character cleared up, he has applied to two Justices for an execution against you but ENDENTRY  with it, but brother Crocket has come over to this district and says that he is more calme than he was. I really hope that he will not procede with his suit for it will only make trouble. I have almost forgotten to tell you that Milton has given up going to Kirt. next spring and wants to come down here in the spring—wants to meet you in Scarborough thinking that you will accompany me there in the spring he wants you to write to him, says that he wishes he was with you here now. Brother and sister Melana send there best respects to you and say they are trying to do as well as they can. I think they are. Sister Sabra are here on a visit and send there love to you and say that the church is doing well there.   meeting, that brother Crocket was wide awake. You did not say any thing about the time that you expected to return here, your three weeks have almost expired and they have been long enough I think. I realy feal lonely here without my page torn but I trust that the Lord will take care of him and return him to me in his time. I dont forget to ask him to daily and trust that I am not forgotten by him. My health is good at present but I have been quite sick with a cold I was much pleased to hear that brother Townsend had joined your company Give my best respects to him and tell him that I want to see him.   the contents, but I did not let them know of the Kirtland affairs, some of them here surmise that a mob has arisen and demolished the press in Kirtland  do as you think best with it.

I have not commenced your coat yet but shall soon. I recollect that this is your birthday would be glad to congratulate you upon the same could I have the privilege.

Notwithstanding years have rolled away between us since we saw each other face to face yet my attachment towards you or my desire for your wellfare either in temporal or spiritual things hath not either lessoned or abated. It certainly is gratifying to  me to hear of the prosperity of my Brethren in evey lawful pursuit Brother Asahel I have long felt anxious to again hear from you I am sensible that it is not alltogether profitable to  be always pouring upon any ones mind any subject however good it may be lest be be weary in consequence of which I have remained more silent upon those subjects  otherwise should have done. But thinking perhaps you would like to Know whare I was how &amp; what I was doing I concluded to call your mind to the perusal of this sheet.

It was truly a happy season to my soul to again meet the inhabitants of Kirtland those with whom I had endured perils &amp; tribulations I visited the house of the lord &amp; its contents &amp; I saw that which I did not expect to behold in my generation &amp; among these things I say the Egyptian mummies &amp; also the Book of  Abram written by his own hand in ancient form. On last sabbath I had the privelege of going up to the house of the Lord in Kirtland to  worship with my Beloved Brethren I  hereing the word of God in company with about 1,000 Saints from the sacred desk but also of declaring the word of God unto them. my happiness hath been great to behold the work of God in these last days &amp; Allthough the gentiles rages &amp; the priest imagin vain things yet the work of God will roll on in spite of all these things untill babylon shall fall Israel be gathered &amp; Christ reign   of study perhaps shall enter school on the morrow what length of tim will take me to accomplish it I am unable to say I may spend the private part of my time for several years in this place.

Brothers Hadlock, &amp;c. went to Kirtland &amp; spent some time there &amp; they say they would not like to have their family is there for they think it harder times than it is in the west to get a living. Perhaps our friends in the West may wonder at our tarrying on this continant so long but the reason  to pay our fare to England we have had much to struggle with. We left home without purs or scrip, &amp; sick &amp; feble but through the great mercy of God we have all been able to reach New York but we all arived here nearly penny less but as I have been out into the country the Lord has put into my hands means sufficient to pay my own fare, but I feel equally interested in the wellfare of my Brethren that they also may have means to go on  hard to prevent the Twelve from filling this mission.

I was called upon in the evening with Brother Clayton to go &amp; visit that Sister that has been so much afflicted possessed with the Devil  do not recollect the name. her husband that was considered under Transgression came to us &amp; confessed his Sins, &amp; next day made acknowledgments before the church. When we arived at his house his wife was in a great rage required 3 men to hold her We lade hands upon her &amp; after a mighty struggle cast the devil out &amp; rebuked the fever &amp; she was made whole &amp; was at meeting comfortable next day, but the devil entered into her child next, day &amp; flung it into a dredful agony &amp; made it as stiff as a stake, we lade hands upon it, &amp; the devil instantly came out &amp; the child fell asleep. I have herd nothing from them of late. We preached with them on Sunday &amp; had a pleasant time with them. We left Manchester on  the 21 them meeting with some opposition in Burslem such as getting the candles &amp; candlesticks flung at their heads while preaching. The rabble generally was lead by John James. We immediately commenced preaching &amp; opening new doors as we had an oppertunity. One evening while I was preaching in Burslem John James came with two constables (to keep the peace for he feared the people) while he could read a  pamphlet exposing Mormonism  letters &amp; P.

We now have meetings in Burslem &amp; Hanly, Lane End, &amp; a number of other places, round about I have been informed that the Rector in New Castle is preaching against us quite a number of Methodist teachers attend our meetings &amp; freequently oppose but they go away confounded while it begets us friends. We have quite a good room in Hanly that we have lived for six months, which will be the standing place for the church to meet in on the Sabbath we have vary full &amp; attentive congregations how many will come out in this regeion I do not know but the work seams to be prosperous here as yet, their has been a number baptized since we came, the Church now Numbers between 70 &amp; 8 others given in their names. I became convinced it was the will of God for one of us to go to Birmingham &amp; taking all things into consideration we thought it best for Elder Turley to go. &amp; consequently he left Burslem for Birmingham on the 28 but I have not herd from him since he Left. We are determined by the assistance of God to open a Door in Every town from the Potteries to Bir mingham &amp; erect a Standard in it. I feel as though it will be a day of warning &amp; not of many words to England. I think that what we do we shall do quickly. I would here also remark their are a number of Doors opening in the towns between the Potteries &amp; Samuel Heath &amp; Elder Clark I believe are labouring there.

I preach on the mor row Sunday in Corden in Hanly. I receved a letter from Elder Birmingham preaching to his relatives in the family circle. but was soon expecting to preach in public. he foud hard work to preach to his parents who had been professors of Godliness 40 years &amp; had great confidence in their ministers. Brother H. Glover has just returned on a visit to his friends about 50 miles &amp; some rage &amp; fight otherers want the word &amp; some wish to be Baptzed. But I will close about matters with us   I will acknowledge I have not had time to meditate upon it &amp; pray about it as much as I could wish but yet the spirit of God knows all things I am sensible you have many difficult know what better you could have done than the course you have persued con sidering all circumstances, but one thing is certain sumbody is much out of the way. In the first place I ask in the name of reason &amp; Revelation that if Sister D is sick what business Sister C or any other person has to accuse her of feigning herself sick, the principle is of the Devil &amp; the spirit of God bears record against it. If Sister C had charity &amp; the Love of God in her soul &amp; was in the way of her Duty she would go &amp; sympathise with Sister D instead of speaking against her &amp; that to behind her back such things are agaist the law of God &amp; iniquity cannot be retained in the church of christ or at least it should not. The church did right in withdrawing the hand of fel- lowship from Sister C, &amp; she ought not to be restored unless she will make an humble acknowledgement of her sins &amp; repent of them before God. if others had sined ever so much it is no place for Sister C to make a bulwark of ENDENTRY  Brother  God hates &amp; if it is not repented of it will bring the curse of God upon the heads of those that are thus guilty. &amp; I believe their is eviel of this kind in Preston, &amp; their are those in preston that have wrongly accused &amp; had evil surmisings both towards you &amp; Sister Richards &amp; if they do not scease from those things &amp; spedaly repent their wickedness shall be manifest &amp; their eniquity brought to light &amp; they will feel the chastning hand of God, &amp; I say it in the name of  it is difficult to deal with such cases whare they are all pointed towa rds ones own self, but I am more &amp; more convinced &amp; that to by the spirit of God, that the church Will never prosper in preston untill they treat you in a different manner from what they are doing at least many of them, they ought to sympathize with you in your affliction &amp; assist you to the necessaries of life, &amp; uphold you by love, confidence prayer &amp; faith, it is what God requires at their hand. Brother &amp; Sister Richards dont be discouraged, the Lord will give you the victory, you shall overcome &amp; your Enemies shall not prevail against you, I  will plead with God for you, you shall have my prayers if I can do nothing more. I would say in all cases of Church dealing it would be well to persue the gospel course &amp; it appears that you have done &amp; leave the event in the hands of God. &amp; let us ask God for wisdom &amp; he will give it unto us.

Brethren this is the first mission we have ever enjoyed together in the vineyard. Can  we for a moment say that our time hath been spent in vain during this period? Nay we cannot  the spirit within me forbids it. Have we not profited by this school of experianc? yea much  evry way. While the Lord hath manifested by revelation that it is his will that we should obtain a  knowledge of Kindgdoms &amp; countries, this mission hath placed us in a situation to avail our-  selves of the desired information upon many things  have obtained. Time will clearly show that the late mission which we have enjoyed together in the City of London (which is still continued by your labours) will ever be firmly engraved  in our minds &amp; occupy an important place, In the history of our travels among the  Nations of the Earth. When London feels the chastning hand of the ALMIGHTY  &amp; in her turn amid the revolutions of the gentile world finds her doom is sealed with her lofty spires, synagogues, mansion, &amp; pallaces, laid in one common ruin, then with what feelings shall we address our children or the thousands that may surround us, while our heads are blossoming with age, as we point to the 21 stood together upon the top of the most splended &amp; highest modern pillar in the Univers &amp; with the naked eye surveyed the most populous &amp; wealthy city upon the face of the  earth, which we can then exclaim hath been the theater of much misry &amp; wo, but now sleeps in death. We ^having in my possessin a history of places visited I feel disposed to give the same {that  Pauls Cathedral which was 500 feet in length 285 in bredth 404 in highth which was 40 years in building from 1675 to 1715 which cost £ 47 monuments of fine marble erected over the Tombs of certain Lords Bishops Generals  Earls &amp; other titles who had distinguished themselves in the military service of Great Brit- ian &amp; otherwise, Lord Nelsons being the most noted, &amp; while historians have taken much  interest in the origen of this cathedral dedicated St Paul which was first built by St Augustine in the year 610, &amp; now considered the largest cathedral in the world excepting  the Vatian at Rome dedicated to St Peter. We ^ourselves^ can clearly see the gentiles are zealous in  a form of Godliness while they deny the power thereof, for while this church stands in  honor to St Paul, those who whorship therein utterly reject &amp; deny the principles which  he tought. Again I think we shall not doubt the words of Soloman when he said man had  sought ought many inventions esspecially when we reflect back to the 1 We desended together about 40 feet into the Bowels of the earth &amp; walked throught the  Tunnel with the River Thames &amp; British shiping over our heads which was opening a thorough  fare from one shore to the other which was finished 1110 ^feet^ &amp; was lighted with gas, arched  overhead &amp; considered one of the greatest wonders of the last days. The time we spent  together on the 5 travled the world oer we could not have found another spot that would have pre- sented a wider field of knowledge &amp; of contemplation as touching the history of the  rise, progress, &amp; fall of Kings, Princes Lords &amp; mighty men of Gentile greatness pride  &amp; boast. This Abbey was composed of eleven Chapels (ownly seperated by walls or petitions) ENDENTRY  6. St. Edward the Confessor. 7. St. Erasmus. 8. Abbot Islip. 9. St. John. 10. St Andrew &amp; 11. St. Michael. &amp; these Chapels contain the Bodies, tombs, &amp; monuments, of of  Kings  Richard II. &amp; William III. &amp; Sebert King of the east Saxons who first built this church  &amp; died July 616 Also  &amp; Phillippa, Matilda. Mary I. — II. &amp; Queen Mary of Scotland, Elizabeth, Catherine,  &amp; Queen Anne &amp; Editha, Eleanor &amp; Caroline &amp; of ^six^ Prince's  Duchess, one ^1^ Marquis, Seven ^7^ Lords, three ^3^ Vicount, Eight ^8^ Countess, three ^3^ Barrons sixteen ^16^—  Earls, eleven ^11^ Admirals,  15 Doctors, 52 Sirs. 153 Gentleman, &amp; 48 Lady deposited in vaults in this Abbey &amp; Monuments erected to their memory. Here we had the privilege of viewing the full stature &amp; perfect likeness of Queen Elizabeth, Mary, &amp; Anne  Lord Nelson, &amp; Pitt &amp; others. We saw the full Coronation Dress of Queen Anne. We  also saw the chair &amp; sat in it, in which Queen Victoria was crowned &amp; all the Kings  &amp; Queens in England for the last 800 years this chair is covered with gold tissue. It  contains a stone under the seat upon which all the Scottish Chiefs, &amp; Kings were crowned  since they were a people it is reported to be Jacobs Pillar which chair has been in use 800 years. In walking through this Abbey we see frequent marks of violence from Oliver Cromwell in defacing some of the tombs, monuments, &amp; brass work with which some of the Abbey was  adorned. Here we behold the art of man with all its combined force &amp; power spun to the  finest thread, &amp; expanded to the fullest extent in the building &amp; finishing of this Abbey as  a general whole, But more esspecially that part called Henry  &amp; a visit to this Abbey is not ownly worthy of the Attention of all travellers but to occupy  a place in the Journal of any Historian.   not pass over our visit to the house of Parliment, on the 8 house of Lords (now occupied as the house of Commons) ^we did not behold^ so much to interest the sight of the eye as  the meditation of the mind, however we had the privilege of resting ourselves by siting in the chair in  which the speaker of the house of Lords had sat for many years. In this room all the speeches were  made by Mr William Pitt while advocating the American cause, before the Revolution. In this room all the laws were made that now governs ^from^ 175 to 200 000 000 of human beings. As the house of  commons was burned down about six years since this room at the present time is occupied  house of commons &amp; there is another house now built which the house of Lords at the  present time occupies. One would naturly suppose that a house of Parliament fitted up to  contained Kings, Lords, &amp; Commons would be sumthing extra, grand, &amp; expensive but we found  it quite the reverse. It is excedingly plain &amp; undecorated. On entering the room one would  sooner think he was in an American school house rather than in a house of Lords or of Commons. While retiring from this scenery we had a view of the order of British soldiery or foot guards while on parade in St James' Park, accompanied by a full band of music.

This gallery contains a vary  great &amp; extensive variety of the most Perfect Paintings that could be gathered together  by the Nation, these with other things we have had the privilege of forming a  knowledge of for ourselves. ^But^ Brethren while you discover that I hav written rather  largely concerning these temporal &amp; perishable objects which are in the same state, &amp; doomed to  share the same fate in the revolutions of the last days &amp; the fall of Babylon, as Jerrusalem did when they rejected their king &amp; put to death the Messiah, think not that I for a moment harbour the idea that the ownly benefit we have derived in the enjoyment of our late  mission together in the City of London has been a knowledge of these things, far from this. for while I have spoken of these things while they were in memory more for the purpose of preserving a historical sketch of the same than other wise, still the remaining part of  the subject rest upon my mind with greater we has not ownly put us in possession of a knowledge of those things spoken of but it hath  given us a more intimate acquaintance with each other &amp; that to in some degree in the midst of trials, which acquaintance has had a tendancy if possible to unite our hearts more closer together in the love of God &amp; the New &amp; Everlasting Covenant. this is  not all. we have stood together in this first mission to the city of London in which  we have had the privilege of uniting our labours in lifting up the standard of truth, of  light, &amp; the fulness of the everlasting gospel, &amp; When on dilligent search we found the whole  city given to Idolitry, Priescraft, tradition, superstition, &amp; all manner of abominations wick- edness, &amp; uncleanness &amp; all doors closed against us we did not hesitate to stand in  the midst of the streets &amp; Jonah like cry repentance unto the Inhabitants of that mighty  city, The Metropolis of Britain, the Boast of the Gentiles &amp; the largest city in the world, containing one million five hundred thousand souls who were  ripened in iniquity, &amp;prepared for the wrath of God, &amp; like the ox going to the slaughter  know not the day of their visitation. Yes Brethren I shall long remember standing in  the midst of that people &amp; assisting you in bearing a message unto them, a message—  ENDENTRY  them, but unto all they unto whom the sound thereof shall come, even of the whole  gentile world &amp; the judgment of the great day shall manifest the truth of it unto all  nations. And it will ever sweeten the memory of that eventful period of my life  to know that our labours on that occasion were not in vain. But that we were  enabled through the great mercy &amp; goodness of God &amp; toil, labour, dilligent search, &amp;  perseverance, to find some of the Blood of Ephraim, a few honest souls that were  willing to recieve &amp; obey the gospel &amp; that we were enabled to lay the foundation  of a work in that City which will not be removed untill the City is warned so that  they will be left without excuse, &amp; the saints gathered out to stand in Holy places  while judgment works. Untill that time the seed which we have sown in that  city &amp; that which you are now sowing shall bring forth fruit &amp; the fruit  shall remain to the honour &amp; glory of God &amp; I say it in the name of   Brethren let  to bear some humble part in the sacrafices, sufferings, &amp; reproach of Christ &amp; of  warning this generation &amp; of gathering together the honest in heart &amp; the meek of the Earth that they with us may stand together in Holy places while judgement  works ^works^, &amp; be prepared to enter into that rest which remaineth for the People of  God. And Dear Brethren my prayer to God is that we may ever be meek &amp; humble  that the Power of the Priesthood &amp; the spirit of our ministry &amp; mission may rest upon  us that we may be carried through evry strait Place wherein we are called to walk that we may keep the faith &amp; overcome the world. I pray my heavenly Father in the name of  Jesus Christ that this may be our happy lot &amp; that we, with all the Elders of Israel, &amp; Saints of God may be prepared to joyfully meet our Lord &amp; Master when he appeareth again the second  time without sin unto salvation.

I was privileged with the company of  Wallace Brethn upon the Subject &amp; I find but one spirit &amp; opinion prevailing amog us &amp; that is, it is far better to withdraw the petition for the present untill you can consult your constituents than to receive a Territorial Government with Military polititions sent unto our midst to tyronize  firm conviction that the Citizens of Deserett will sustain you in withdrawing your petition for the time being rather ^than^ to receive a Terratorial Government with the spirit of restrictions that the present Congress manifest in disposition to lay upon us.

Wishingtin D. C. ENDENTRY    of God &amp; considering you willing to instruct your inferiors uppon spiritual subjects, &amp; after forming such conections of your character I take this method to ask ^you^ several questions for information &amp; instructions as I have no other motive in view, &amp; should you not consider it beneath your notice to answer my questions by writing but give me your opinion as you have formed it from the word of God it would be highly interesing to me   healing the sick casting out devils &amp;c. 2th the Sabbath &amp; its changes. 3th &amp; last is the subject of babtism. Firstly, while perusing the sacred volumen of inspiration I find many wonderful works were performed by our Saveiour and likewise by the apostles though not by their own power but by faith in &amp; through Jesus Christ &amp; if I mistake mot when Christ first sent his disciples to preach the gospel which was to the lost sheep of the house of israel he commanded them to rase the dead cast out devils &amp;c S. Mathew. chap. X Matthew 10 again in the last chapter of S. Mark Mark 16:14-18 Christ appeared to the eleven as they sat at meat &amp; gave them a varry forcible command to go into all the world &amp; preach the gospel to ev^e^ry creature he that believeth &amp; is baptized shall be saved &amp; he that believeth not shall be damned &amp; these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall lay hands on the sick &amp; they shall recover &amp;c this apparently was the last command given by our saveiour before he assended to heaven. now the question that arises in my mind is when &amp; whare were those gifts done away as some maintain that they are. I find no scripture satisfactory to prove that they ever were done away theirfore I am led to believe that God is the same to day as in ancient days &amp; likewise should people at this day live as did the apostles &amp; exercise the faith that did Isacc that those gifts might again be on the earth and in case of sickness we might loock to the Lord for deliverance in prefference of trusting to an arm of flesh. we read of a woman that was ill that had suffered many things of many Physicians &amp; had spent all that she had &amp; was nothing better but rather grew worse which was finally healed by her faith in Christ. Luke 8:43-48 should light be held up to the world uppon this subject at the preasent day undouptedly their would be as little heed given to it as the Lord told Ezekiel their would be to his prophecy when he sent him to the house of israel, yet I ask your opinion uppon the subject for information   &amp; ought not light uppon this subject be held up even if it is not received) ENDENTRY  the first day of the week as the sabbath, but when God appeared to mount he commanded him to keep the seventh day as the sabbath &amp; not to labour on that day, ##Exodus 20:8-11## so it appears that  if their has mot been a change of the sabbath we as a body are not keeping the day that we ware commanded to keep still it is held up to view at this day that the sabbath has been changed, but is it mot allowed that their has mot been no change in any of those commands that were given to Moses at the time that the command of the  given &amp; why has the sabbath been changed while the other commands remain good &amp; sacred &amp; while we are under them &amp; ought to obey them it is maintained ^by some^ that Christ rose on the first day of the week &amp; that the work of Redempttion was greater than the work of creation &amp; this they appear to consider as the change of the sabbath, but when we carefully peruse the writings of the four Evangelist respecting the resurrection of Christ does it not appear as reasonable to suppose that Christ rose on the seventh day as first, &amp; even did Christ really rise on the first day of the week does that prove that it was a change of the sabbath &amp; if the sabbath was changed by the resurrection of Christ would their mot have been sumthing said respecting that change so that the evidence would have been clear that the change of the sabbath was then perfected. sir this is a subject that has some length of time ocipied a seat in my mind &amp; I lay it before you considering you have far deeper understanding of the word of God than myself &amp; would wish to know your views uppon this subject as I have not understood the scriptures to be verry plain respecting the change of the Sabbath   babtism &amp; it is a subject to that has long lain with wait on my mind I think it not ownly our duty but our highest privledge to take the word of God &amp; make it the man of our council &amp; form our principles theirby still we may benefit by the instruction of those that are more experianced than ourselves I for one Consider myself transacting business for Eternity &amp; I believe that Jesus Christ sat the example for the pilgrain to follow &amp; I believe that the christian ought to strive to imitate his example as near as possible (allthough I for one come far short of it) I at times have been allmost overwhelmed in as^s^tonishment while meditating uppon the difference of opinion &amp; principle that exist in our land uppon religious subjects when we have all the sane bible to read the same spirit to direct but more especially uppon the subject of babtism. my mind has long been seleled with regard to this subject still I have remained silent uppon the subject as I am of the opinion that evry person ought to be fully established  I had the ordanonce of infant babtism administered to me but it does not answer my mind for I have not found any scripture to support it from revelation ENDENTRY  to me how so many great divines that have been so long holding  up the light of the gospel &amp; still continue in so gross an error with respect to babtism. for if I am not greatly mistaken I find no account of John or any of the apostles administering the ordinance  of babtism untill they become believers in Christ or at least untill they considered them true believers &amp; that appeared to be all that was required of them in order to be babtized was to believe that Jesus Christ was the son of God &amp; if they spiritually believed this they must be penitent believers &amp; respecting the mode of babtism it appears plain to me that their is no room for one a moment to doubt but that our saveiour was buried in babtism in the river Jordan and that all that the Apostles babtized ware buried with Christ in babtism &amp; setting aside evry other example but the one that Christ left us that alone ought to be sufficient to convince mankind that emmersion was the rite &amp; ownly mode of babtism (to use the language of Dr Daddridge Jesus had no sin to wash away &amp; yet he was babtized and God owned this ordinance so far as to make it a season of pouring forth the spirit uppon him &amp; this ought to silence evry objection to the practice)   that those things are not escential but may we mot with the same propriety say that when Isaac that it was not essential whether he offered his son or a lamb out of his flock &amp; who of decided virtue will admit that the Lord would have received Abrahams offering  return had he offered a lamb in stead of his son, &amp; why should any believe that infant sprinkling will be as acceptable in the sight of God for babtism as to follow the example that our saveiour hath given has not Christ plainly told us that he is the way ^the truth life^ &amp; if mankind ever enter in to the kingdom of heaven must it not be by him ##John 14:6## i then ought we not to obey his commands and follow his precepts &amp; not climb up some other way.   convinced of the mode of baptism, &amp; believe it to be essential to my prosperity &amp; happiness the information that I wish you to communicate to me respecting this subject is whether it is against your principle &amp; discipline to administer the ordinance of babtism to those that you consider to be proper subjects without joining the Church for I at preasent am not prepared to unite ^join^ with any church still I feel it a duty to be babtized &amp; would wish to take up the cross when I have a fair opportunity  I have premeditated a conversation with you uppon this subject but have delayed it as my brother is expecting to be babtized &amp; I have rather been waiting for him. sir I have ^not^ intended any harm by asking those questions &amp;

I have so many things in my mind at this time that I wish to communicat &amp; so little time &amp; room to do it in that I hardly know whare to begin or how to End. I feel that there never was a store House ten story high filled from top to bottom with Merchantdize that cant have more of a variety in it than I have in my mind at this time. &amp; I hardly know how to go to work to give you a description of my situation but I will try to do it by parible. figure, similee or sumthing or other. I am far from feeling  would not to the world, that you may ketch my view of the situation of things here. In the first place permit me to say that I never before witnessed such a scenery as I am Experiencing here neither did I every expect to in my generat some of the time the Devil to. I have had some mighty Battles with the devil sword in hand since I have been here &amp; God has enabled me to give him a deadly wound &amp; routed him out  of his camp &amp; he has fled from me wounded &amp; roaring like a Lion  the sound of his roar about 10 miles off &amp; I expect him to return for an other Battle by &amp; by for you are aware tha noise &amp; so you can form sumthing of an Idea of it from the following description. I have been here 21 days preached 20 times &amp; Baptized Mr Thomas Kington the superintendant of the preachers of the United Brethren, a branch of or broke off from the Methodist Church &amp; with Mr Kington I Baptzed 23 preachers of the same Order that was under his superintendance &amp; also I Baptzed 46 of the members of the same church making 70 in all, this scenery has committed into my hands &amp; charge &amp; my controll mostly 45 esstablished places of preaching most of which are licensed according to Law, &amp; also 48 Preachers 24 of which I have already Baptzed &amp; most of the rest are ready as soon as they can have an opportunity. as I said before I say a gain their will be a mighty harvest here for all the churches which these preachers are over are ready to receve the word. should I judge from outward appearances I should think their would spedily be 500 Baptzed in this region &amp; probably more still I dont wish to count chickens before they are hatched. I am now Baptzing about 10  time a day. I Baptzed 6 preachers yesterday &amp; I have a number to Baptze to day. yesterday 3 preachers came in a charriot or Gig to visit me they never had herd me preach at all. I had on wet cloths &amp; going to the pool to Baptze. I testified of Jesus Christ unto them the power of God rested upon us &amp; they kneeled down &amp; wept &amp; prayed, &amp; their Gig stood still &amp; they all went down into the pool the same hour &amp; I Baptzed them &amp; they went their way rejoiceing &amp; praising God. Mr Kington is an humble man I have Ordained him an Elder &amp; I ordained two priest their will be many worthy labourers raised up in this country. you see by this time Brother Richards I am not Idle but have much to do &amp; need much wisdom from God to do it well, for it is the strongest fishing ever I have done &amp; I domt expect any thing els but while gathering the Salmon I shall get among them some ells &amp; snakes for their has already been sone after they  pitch &amp; Bound like a porpose or jump &amp; roll like a hen with their head cut off manifesting every kind of spirit but that of order &amp; if ever an Elder had any triming to do I expect to have my share of it by &amp; by for in doing such a rapid work as this I have to become all things to all men for I cannot get time to do much triming as yet. in fact some have before I was aware of it ENDENTRY  stop to all disorder as fast as possible. &amp; again I am Having a mighty struggle against this  power of falling down like a dead man stiff as a stake which is in some of the preachers as well as the people. I have to handle all these things in wisdom. among the number that I have &amp; are Baptzing are some large farmers having 3 or 400 acres of land I have Baptzed sone constables as well as preachers. there is a Merchent in Hanly that we Baptzed that trade is so bad that he is wind ing up business &amp; wants to go to Zion with the Saints. I have Baptzed most of his relatives here several Brothers &amp; Sisters here he has come down to visit them he has said sumthing to them about it. &amp; they all want to  the U.S.A. &amp; in fact most all the Saints are getting the same spirit here without my preaching it. I do wish the Twelve would spedily come to England that we might hold a council somewhare about these &amp; many other things. when you next write to me say a word to me what your mind is about this. the farmers here feel like this that bad times are coming &amp; the sooner they can turn their property in to gold the better &amp; in fact with the view I have of the  times I cannot advise them as yet to the contrarary. you begin to see Brother Richards that I must have much to occupy my mind at preasent considering what I have to do. &amp; in addition to this I have just recceved a Litter from Elder  taken with a  for an old Debt that Brother Turley contracted 15 years ago before he left England, or in other words Turley was in partnership with a man &amp; when they dissolved Turley gave up the stock into his hands to se sell the stock for as much as he expeted &amp; that he has still claims On Turley. John Jones in Burslem was connected in taking him It is merely a trick of the Devil to stop his preaching but I believe the Lord will overturn it for Gdod how long he will be confined in prison I do not know. The whole Labour at the Potteries is now flung upon Elder Cordon &amp; when he wrote me he was some out of health &amp; should their be any faithful labourer at liberty would they not do well to go into that part of the vineyard &amp; assist. And again in addition to this case I have a certain Brother Richards whome I love of a truth for the truths sake that dwelleth in him &amp; I pray God that it may be with him forever &amp; he asks an interest in my prayerrs in  his behalf &amp; his companions that the Lord may manifest his will concerning them. I will now say Dear Brother I will gladly comply with your request the first leasure moments I can get, in fact I have attempted two or three times since I recceved your two Letters upon the subjet to lay the case before the Lord but no sooner than I would begin to pray some one would b wraping at my door for me to go &amp; baptzed them or for sumething els. in fact since I recceved your letters I have had no spare time hardly to pray for any thing, for you see how things are  with me &amp; of course can judge how my time is taken up. I scarcely pass a pool of water but what sumbody is waiting there for me to baptze them. &amp; in fact if John had more Baptizing to do when all Judea &amp; Jerrusalem went unto him to be Baptzed, then I have had for a few days past he certainly had his hands full. But do not think dear Brother that I shall close this letter with out answering the questions you have asked me &amp; expressing my feelings unto you No God forbid  not with standing I have not had time to lay your case before the Lord as I could wish, yet I have a word to express upon the subject. In the first place I wish to say I recceved your tw several times. &amp; you speak my mind perfectly with regard to any other persons opening any of our letters excepting our own Qu my returned, I did not then expet to be gone but vary few days before my return &amp; it was  under the impression that if I had a letter at all during my absence it would be from Brother Manchester, &amp; as they wanted to hear from him I gave them that priv^i^lege with a charge to say nothing concerning the contents if their was any thing that the church should not know ENDENTRY  have sent orders for no more letters to be opened that are sent to me. And with regard to the question you asked me on the scrap of paper. (I say yes let them eat or drink what they will in such cases) I should be pleased Brother Richards to hear from you often &amp; give me all the news you have from any quarter I was pleased to hear of doors being opened in Scotland tell me whare I can direct a letter to Elder Mullenner in Scotland. also inform me of any information you get from any of the Twelve I wonder why they tarry so long in America may the Lord hasten them to his country. Also inform me concerning sister Richards health from time to time give my love to her &amp; tell her I should be exceding glad to see her but when I shall get out of this part of the vineyard I cannot tell. pray for me Brother Richards that I may be meek &amp; humble that I may fully overcome evry speces of pride &amp; self wrighteousness  my dependence on God in all things, &amp; that I may know the mind of God concerning me in all things. A word concerning you &amp; Sister Richards. But what am I that I should teach or instruct thee or inquire the will of the Lord concerning thee. O that I was more worthy that I might greant thee the desire of thy heart in this  God concerning myself &amp; all things that are required at my hand that I might be more fully prepared to greant thee thy request. But if you can receive it at my hands I say unto you thus  saith the Lord let not my servant Willard Richards litely essteem his calling or station for I have called him &amp; he is a chosen vessel unto me &amp; no man shall ever do his work or take his crown. for he is humble &amp; seeks my will, his afflictions shall work together for his good in the end, let him be not weary in commtting his case unto the Lord or trusting in my name &amp; I will bring it to pass &amp; the darkness shall pass away &amp; the light shall come. &amp; I page torn break the bands that bind him &amp; liberate him from those under his charge for they page torn not worthy &amp; some are under condemnation for litely essteeming the priesthood  whome God has set over them. Let him still call upon me in Mighty prayer &amp; be not weary committing his companions &amp; all his ways into my hands &amp; I will work out his deliverance in a way that I have prepared, &amp; he shall yet have many souls as seals of his ministry, &amp; be mighty in council, &amp; much beloved by his brethren the Twelve. Thus Dear Brother is the voice of the spirit concerning you &amp; I would say to Sister Richards by way of council to try not to be discouraged nor desire to die but to live. though your afflictions may be great for a time yet consider what Jesus has bourn, commit all your ^ways^ unto the Lord you will ere long enter that rest that remains for the people of God then your morning will be turned into joy &amp; you will be satisfyed with the goodness of  the Lord I feel as though the Lord will open a door whareby you will be liberated before many days I will pray for you before God that your faith fail not &amp; that you may have grace &amp; strength according to your day. whatever is manifested unto me I will endeavour to communicate it unto you from tine to time.

It is  begining to become the day of Gods power here in some degree. &amp; I  hardly know what make of it all. for some cause no man dare meet me in publick or come nijh nigh me at all to oppose me I have not had the first word of opposition in publick, but yet the whole world is stired up here all the Church Ministers are holding conventions here &amp; they find they cannot stop me or the work by law &amp; they are afraid of lo they have come to the conclusion to sink pools &amp; baptized their churches by immersion as the ownly way to save them. they sent to one of their constables to take me up but they sent to the wrong man for before the message came to him I had Baptized him. one of the clerks of the church is intending to be Baptized but I have not yet given him an opportunity. my labours have  mostly been at Frooms Hill 5 miles from Ledbury I never preached in  Ledbury untill last evening, &amp; notwithstanding I did not know a soul that lived in town, yet a large number flocked around me in the streets as  soon as it was known that I was in town &amp; gave me a hearty shake of  the hand &amp; the Baptist minister came to me rejoiced at an  large chapel for me to preach in went with me into the pulpit &amp; prayed mighlyly for God to bless me &amp; I preached to the largest congragation ever met in the house  the Minister &amp; rest members in town are Belveing.

I remarked to you in the last that I wished. you to come soon &amp; labour with me awhile I did not as fully give my reason for the remark as I ought &amp; should have done if I had room. But I would here remark that I did not make the request thinking that I had any power, desire, or wish to controll you.

I have confirmed about 100 &amp; their will soon be another hundred to confirmed &amp; I have just as much as I can do to preach &amp; to Baptze daily without confirming. theirfore I stand much in need of some assistance &amp; council in such a field. I have Baptzed about 40 preachers of the Unted Brethren primitive Methidist.  places of preaching which are licensed including one or two chapels. &amp; you can see at once Elder Richards that it am overwhelming labour to be upon one man. &amp; he needs his spirit sanctified &amp; his Body Immortal to stand such a labour &amp; it has put me at times to my wits ends to know what to do with so many places of preachings &amp; preachers, But according to the Best wisdom I could get  to continue to fill their appointments &amp; teach righteousness &amp; try to prepare the minds of the people for the fulness of the gospel, but not to administer in any of the ordinances of the gospel untill I can have some help &amp; set in order the churches &amp; ordain such persons as God shall call. the reason I have done this is  meeting &amp; congregation those houses of worship will be shut up &amp; sants might be shut out of the Kingdom that otherwise might come  a course. I am well aware Brother Richards their is much to do in many places But it does appear to me that their is no field at present in England, whare your labour &amp; council is more needed or would be of more benefit than to join me in this field a season.
