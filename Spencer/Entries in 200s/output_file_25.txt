 A large congregation, good order, And attention. this is the last time I have seen ElderHyde: He went to Washington, to transact some business, And I took steem boat with my familyto go East via Lakes. I will here name that while we were Journeying by land we all enjoyedgood health And our youngest child which had been vary feeble in health from her birth improvmuch while on land but as soon as we took water began to run down. And we had to dependupon milk we could get on our road for her living, And we co[u]ld not get it while on the Illinois River for several days. she ceased to eat any thing, fevar set in and bowel complaintAnd when we Arived At Perue the termination of the canal she was vary low. we went12 miles into the country At my Brother in Laws, capt Lther Scammans, who married my wifesister, And on the second day after our Arival at his house our child Shuah C. Woodruff Diedon the 22nd July Aged 9 month. we buried her in Capt Scammans garden And put A stone ather grave with her name Age &c Engraved upon it. we both felt this to be a great sacrificeAs we have the loss of our other children. After spending A few days here we continued ourjourney (Accompanied by our worthy Brother Dominicas Cartar) via Chicago, Buffalo, Albany,And Arived in Boston on the 12 October. The 2nd night After I left Albany, one quarterand the most business part of that city was laid in Ashes: damage Estimated at fivemillions dollars; [FIGURE] many of their houses were truly left unto them desolate" Soon aftermy arival in Boston, my Wife & children went to Maine, & spent their time with theirfriends untill the setting in of winter. Since that time they have spent their time inCambridge port, Mass. as it was nearer the centre of my labours, And I could occasionallyspend A little time At home. I have however spent the greatest part of my time travellingsince I arived in this country, visiting the Branches, parts of Branches, scattered saints &corganizing whare it needed it, leaving or sending the Epistle of Dec 23rd 1847 to those who had itnot, Endeavord to impress upon the minds of all the Saints the importance of puting into practicethe council And teaching contained in the Epistle, Urged the immediate gathering of the Saintsif they could get no further than St Louis, thinking that if they could once get started out oftheir bed for the west, they would some day get to the valley. I have found the Saints in theseEastern lands though few in Number, scattered over A wide Extent of country.  since I arivedI have visited Philadelphia, New Jersey, New York, Long Island, Norwark, North Haven, New Havan,Fair Havan, Ct.  New Bedford, Fall River, Lowell, Salem, Bradford, Northbridge, Mass. Peterboro,Guilsom, Walpole Athans, N. H.  Saco, portland, Milton, Farmington, Maine, And A numbeof other places whare some saints reside. I have visitded most of the saints in the Eastern Stateswith the Exception of those at New Brunswich, Canidas, And some in vermont. while in Mainelate in November I went to Portland, to get Passage to St Johns, to visit St Johns, MiramichHalafax, & other Parts of New Brunswick, Canida &c: But Steemers had stoped running, And Icould ownly get passage from Boston, on board of th Liverpool Packets that touch at HalafAnd As it was cold weather And difficult travelling in the winter, in that countryI concluded to omit it untill the opening of Spring, when I am Expecting to make atour through that region of country. In my travels among the churches in the EasterStates I have found them in many instances in a scattered & unorganized condition

 I think there will be a number ofyet added to that branch of theChurch. I feel thankful that I have the privilege ofgathering a few grapes after the vintage has done, whilein New York on Sunday & Monday last I had an interviewwith a gentleman by the Name of Joseph Smith was intro-duced to him by Br Holister. He is a smart intelligentbusiness man, is believing our doctrine & wishes to goto the valley & spend his days with the Saints, for He sees astorm coming, & knows of no other place of reffuge thatHe can get to but Zion, And this feeling is stealing owrsome, & suddenly siezeing others of that part of mankind who reflect& begin to deeply feel this Eternal truth which is now revealingit self before their Eyes that their is sumthing awful aboutto burst upon the world which the Nations cannot Esscape &they feel they need some place in the Chambers of the rokcks tohide up in order to escape some terrible blow, & they can findNo place suitable for the occasions ownly with the Mormonsin the valley of the Mountains. My whole soul is on fire oftenwhen I reflect upon the state of Great Babylonn, & behold the saints whichare appraching the Earth, & view the contrast of the scenes to be Enacted in Zion & Gog, Jerrusalem & Egypt. The world is likea drunken man staggering reeling & falling into an abiss while theSaints ^Elders^ who isare faithful before God, begin to feel ligke theAngels who siezd Lot by his garment to hasten him outof Sodom; I want the prayers of my brethren that I maybe sustained & have the power of God rest upon me dailythat I may be enabled to cry aloud & spare not while Iam in the midst of Babylon. I do not want the Bloodof any man to be found in my skirts, NotwithstandingI am in a portion of the vineyard whare I am surrouded with but fewSaints & travelling almost daily in the midst of masses of menwhose bands of wickedness are so strong that no man can breakthem & are ripe for the damnation of Hell, yet I have neverfelt on any mission before such a wait of Responsibility restingupon me as of late. when I reflect upon my calling as an Apostleof Jesus Christ, A shepherd to the flock, A minister of the Gospel

 Please read the remainder of this communication to thyselfPresident Young. I consider that a sense of duty requiredme to lay before you certain things which have been a source ofmuch grief and sorrow to me since my arrival in England. Someof the reasons why I have not before opened my mind to you uponthe subject have been: that I have not wished to trouble your mindwith any thing that I could get along without; and it has been muchagainst my will to find fault with my bretheren; and lastly I havelived in hopes of arranging all matters in an amicable manner withoutcalling your attention to the subject at all. But I have at last, cometo the conclusion that you ought to know all; you will then understandmy position and know how to to remember me before the Lordand perhaps you may be somewhat surprized at what I am aboutto reveal to you. At the Death of Joseph, you are well aware, therewas a struggle for power among certain men in America. And you ^You have^felt the weight of this Truth in Zion & so have I in Liverpool, [far]among men from whom I looked for better things viz: R. Hedlock andT. Ward.There has been one evil in this church from the beginning.Give men a little extra power and influence for a season. when it iscalled for they are not willing to give it up or fill their own placeand susttain men in their's. At last, I have found it so here.I will now give you a statement of facts as near as I can intruth since my arrival in Liverpool.When I first landed I dis-covered a coldness and distance on the part of Elder Hedlock to-wards me, but much more so towards Brother Clark. After spendinga few days in getting settled I began to make inquiry into the affairsof the office. Brother Hedlock said the account books were there I couldexamine them. The books not being kept in a systimatical orderI could not readily comprehend things. I soon saw every exertion wasmade to prejudice my mind against Brother Clark. The Spirit againsthim was of such a nature that I saw he could never work withBrother Hedlock. In fact the accusations against him were of sucha nature and urged so warmly I was obliged to make it almost myfirst business to trace up the accusations against him to the fountainhead through all it's windings. It appeared to me to be like greatgroanings among the mountains to bringforth a mouse. it endedin this fact: he had kissed somebody. In my opinion it was moreto keep him out of the Emigration business than to clear the church ofcrime. After I settled this up I advised him to take charge ofsome conference for a season until there was a better feeling at Liverpool.I made my address to the churches through the Star and had myrecommendation published with it that the Saints might know thatI came with authority from the proper source.I saw that BrothersHedlock and Ward seemed to be much troubled about their standingso I made choice of them for councillors out of respect to the menand their former standing, thinking they would operate with me. Therewas nothing in the Star but that all was right. but the more I advancedtowards my place as President to take charge of affairs and directthem, the more I found a spirit against it and secretiveness in allthings especially with Bro. Hedlock; and Brother Ward had so muchof John Bull in him, it seemed at times that it was of more consequenceto him than the Priesthood. And as out of the heart the mouth speakethI soon saw things in their hearts not right if I could judge from thecourse they were pursuing. their feelings were "We have power & influenceand we will hold it." Brother Hedlock continues to carry on businesshis own way without consulting me in scarcely anything unless I draggedit out of him, and knowing it was my place and duty to understandwhat was going on I inquired into matters until in several instanceshe insulted me in the office and manifested much anger in the midstof considerable company, and as I would not quarrel with him, atleast, in company, I quit the room. when he got mad he would sayhow much the Twelve were laying up from his labours and he oughtto have his share of it as well as they. In several instances he threatenedof leaving the office and going home at once. As he had threatened it so muchI finally told him, I did not care how quick he went. "Yes" then sayshe "I know that is what you want, to get rid of me and get Brother Clarkand you will do well enough." There has been so much of this spiritthat there has been no union. I have been a speckled bird and strangeramong them until it has caused me tears and sorrow by day andnight. I have grown old under it. We have never bowed our knees togetherin prayer, but once, since we met, unless it has been in a conference.If men are not agreed how can they walk together. Had they have beenan Enemy I could have met them but they were my counsellors, inone sense tried friends; men from whom I expected better things. Menthat ought to have known my place and given it ^to^ me and helped me 
 16 miles East of BWebber River Oct 5th 1850President YoungDear SirWe send unto youour Brethren Miner Atwood & Wm Branch with arequest to you that you will use your influenceto assist those Brethren to obtain some oxen to assistus the last 30 miles or so to get into the Valley we cannotcross those two last Ridges without some assistance Ourteams Have failed us much faster since we leftBridger than Before. our oxen & cows are daily failing& dying in the yoke as it were. we Have 25 waggons in our Divisionwe are the Last company except Brother Hunters we stand in Needof a yoke of oxen to each waggon if we can get them but ifwe can get half that Number it will be a great Help to usElder L.

 Upper crossing of the Platt Sept 3rd 1850President YoungDear SirWe received a visit a few days since from Brothers Stratton & Hanks As messengers from the valley Their visit Has truly cheered our hearts & not oursownly but the Hearts of all the moveing camps of Israel who are wending their way through these mountains to their desired Home. It Has caused our souls to rejoice not ownly in the interest the presidency of the Church manifest for our welfare but also of the Glad tidings & good report they bring of the universalprosperity & Blessings of God upon the Saints in the valleys of the Mountains. I wish to say a few words concerning my present condition & circumstances & the company with me I received your letter of instructions while in the east concerning the gathering of the Saints from the Eastern Lands. I laboured with all disligence to carry out the instructions given me. It was aBarren field & like the gleaning of grapes after the vintage wasdone yet in my gleanings we Baptized about 800 & gathered about 500 for the vally & the remainder who are in the faith will leave the east for the valley next Spring. I started from Boston the 9th April with 209 of the Saints the Philadelphia company started a week before in consequence of freight Baggage &c we Had to take slow tra[i]ns or Emigrant trains which made it somewhesomewhat late in ariving at Kanesville. I sent two men early in the season to St Louis with what means we could raise to procure teams for our journey but Nothing ^was^ bought untill my arival the great flood of gold emigration Had drained the country of cattle & most of the emigrating Saints had also bought before we purchased & it seemed almost imposs-ible to obtain teams at all, & we had to purchase mostlywild unbroke steers or old oxen, However through the Blessing of God we were enabled to organize a company of over sixty waggons & crossed the Mo River the 16th June the majority of which were our Eastern Brethrn, but many Had to stop that expected to come in consequence of the High price of oxen & the count of Measures. We first organized our company into two divisions

 of Salvation to a Nation & Generations over whose head I beholdthe drawn sword of an angry God suspended, which is aboutto fall And fill all Idomie with death, I feel to cry outLord who is sufficient for these things, yet I feel thankfulto my Heavenly Father that He has granted unto me aportion of his Holy spirit & Enabled me thus far onthis jouney & Mission to bear a true & faithfultestimony to the rightous & wicked as far as Ihave had an opprtunity, and to keep myseflf unspottedfrom the world. I had rather have favor with GodAngels & the martered Saints, & my Brethern in the valleythan to have all the Thrones and glories of the world combinedin my possession, for they look to me at the present timelike poor worthless rotten things ready to fall downThere is nothing appears valuable to me but Mormonismfor that Embraces all the substance & truth of Heaven &Earth, and I hate to leave off thinking, talking or writing aboutit, Still the things which move around us will attract ourNotice for a moment, some have mattracted my attention fora few days past a little as I have been travelling, one or two ofwhich I will mention. Wm Smith is figuring in these EasternStates of late to try to do sumthing but He cannnot acomplishit. G. J. Adams has again turned to what He calls righteousnessjoined the Temperanc Society & trying to raise up a Kingdomin Baltimore, & while on his way to [Vorel] to attend a conferencecalled into my meeting on Sunday at New York the firsttime I have seen him since I came East. I paid noattention to him No more than if He had not been thereHe sat untill meeting was about closed & went quietly awaywithout saying a word to anyone. I McGee Van Dusen hasstood in the streets of New York for nearly the whole pastpast year crying aloud & selling his Pamphlets containinghis startling Disclosures of the Great Mormonc Conspiracy againstthe liberties of the country Being their celebrated Endowments &c(A copy of which I will forward to Brother Brigham with this, so youcan see how the Devil progresses in the East) 
 West Jordan, June 26, 1886Emeline WoodruffMy dear Daughter I received your letter of the 22. And I received one before that,I had not answered. The reason I had not written before is I have been at work getting up a synopsis of all my journals for 51 years, that I could record in my Last journal so I could lay them away, then I have to write from 2 to 8 letters a day myself on Churchbusiness. It is not because I have forgotten you or the family. I would like to come and visit you and the family if I could in safety but our enemies are so diligent after me and my Quorum that I have to withdraw from all of my family and entirely hide up in the County. And I expect I shall soon have to leave this county or go into the hands ofmy enemies. My health is pretty good and my [blank] are good as far as the times will allow.This whole nation is persecuting us under the form of law. They will both mob and rob us as far as the Lord will let them. The Nation would not persecute us if we were not the true Church of Christ. It stands us all in hand to be true and faithful to our God,to our religion, and to our covenants. Give my Love to your Mother and to Marion,Ensign, John and Julia. I hope Ensign will attend school steady what time he has to goand improve his time and learn all he can for he will stand in need of it. He ought not to stay out of school for sleigh riding or anything else but he should attend steady so asto get all the benefit he can from it. Any letters for me left with Brother Juques at the office. He will send to me. I remain your Affectionate FatherW WoodruffPrivate to yourself and MotherEmelineI have felt a good deal of anxiety about your Marriage with David Burrows. I have been afraid you would throw yourself away. You are a good girl, a good Latter Day Saintand you are worthy of a good industrious, worthy man and a good Latter Day Saint. Itlooks as though he got baptized and attends meetings to get a wife. I don't want you to take a step that you will regret afterwards. I want you to study well this matter and not take a step that will cause you sorrow. Now Sylvia Woodruff has flung herself away bymarrying Heber Thompson. He cannot provide her a home, food or raiment and she is in poverty and affliction. I do not know what condition Br. Burrows is in to give you ahome and make you comfortable, you should look into this before you marry. It is a very important step to take in life. Your husband should be temperate, industrious and moral and not addicted to any bad practices. Many has inherited sorrow by marriage,still marriage is honorable and it is right for girls to marry but they want to know whothey are getting. I am anxious to have you do well.Your affectionate FatherW. WoodruffEmeline I want to give you a little advice about signing your name. It is not proper forany young lady to put Miss before her name. But whoever addresses you should write Miss before your name. But the person writing should not put it to their own name. You should write Emeline Woodruff and not Miss Emeline Woodruff. But it is proper for anyone addressing you to write Miss Emeline. Try to remember this. WW

 to fill it instead of placing me in a situation where I must warfor it and gain every inch of ground as at the point of a bayonet.In speaking of the Emigration, Elder Hedlock has said it wasa very bad plan to change names and whenever he did leave hecould make me an agent to transact business in his name, as hisname was now so universally known, he has taken no pains toacquaint me with the business or introduce me to any of the captainsbut generally if any come to do business, he would sooner walkaway from me than acquaint me with what he was doing. We haverented a new respectable office for three years. he has rented itin his own name, he is also selling a part of it in his own name.In fact he does all business in his own name without any regardto me whatever as touching Emigration & Renting rooms, and one wouldthink from his actions that he was laying a foundation to spendgenerations to come upon his own look in Liverpool. He has beento much expense this season in publishing large handbills andcards in his own name and scattered them all over the kingdomas a general shipping agent without consulting me at all uponthese things. He is so secret in his movements and singular in hishabits that neither myself nor any man about the office knowswhere he lives or boards, neither can I find out, though I have askedhim several times. He counts it an insult to be asked the questionHe has kept the Temple Books until lately and signed all the re-ceipts in his own name. he has manifested a spirit to gain allthe influence possisble. I had a plain talk with Elder Warda short time since upon the subject, (as I had heard much testimonyfrom others what they had said behind my back) I told Brother WardI knew my place and my counsellors ought to know it also.I informed him they could not grease, soap or swallow me. that ifthey undertook to ride me they would find a hard seat before theygot through. I told him that Brigham Young and not Reuben Hedlockwas President of the church, and if Hedlock had power and influencethe Presidency of the Church had given it to him, and if he werein the way of his duty he would throw that influence into thechannel where it ought to be, for the stream had run out ofthe channel long enough. I told him it was time for me to haveLicense for Emigration and for my name to appear upon the doorpost and sign boards, hand-bills and cards as well as R. Hedlock's. Elder Hedlock had found fault because I hadinterfered with the Temple Books, but I have gone forward andtaken them into my own possession and the Temple money also.I gave Brother Ward to understand that I wanted my nameto go as publisher of the Star, so it has found a place there; sinceI took a decided stand upon the subject they have yielded in a degree, but I do not at the present time know the income andoutgo of the emigration. Hedlock attends to that, keeps his own bookshe does not consult me upon the subject. if he converses on thesubject it is to some one besides me. When I have conversedwith him upon the subject, he has said when the debts he hadcontracted were paid he would give it up. He has also the MusicHall rented in his own name. I do not think myself that BrosHedlock is a suitable person to conduct the Emigration here. Ithink he has charge of it as long as is for our good. I think hedoes not manifest the economy at all times that our circumstancesrequire. There has been much said at times about how muchhe has paid out of his own pocket in carrying on business here,but he had nothing when he came, and all his generosity, freedomand expense have been at the expense of the office. They madea collection among all the churches a short time before I came,to pay the the debt for emigrating the poor, which they divided betweenthem. I do not know what it amounted to, perhaps £50 or so.but I gave much offence because I inquired into it. In themidst of all this there are times when Brother Hedlock manifestsa desire by words to do what good he can and help to roll onthe work but he has a very strange way of showing it since Ihave been here. My arrival here was far from being welcome bythose who were in the office at Liverpool. I was informed, ElderHedlock said when he heard I was coming that I was a very tightpernicious, close man. Thomas Wilson, a man with them in the officesaid, if that were the case, I was not needed in England. There hasbeen a spirit manifested here that they were afraid they wouldnot get pay enough for what they did. Taking all these things into con-sideration I do not think things will go right until Brother Hedlockis called home, and transfers the business ^over^ into my hands. I shall thenknow what shape it is in, but if the way he is doing business somuch out of sight was to be continued in the same way for fiveyears, I would be as much in the dark about it at the end as I amnow. I think if you should counsel him to come home and transferall matters into my hands, that he would begin to think somethingabout it. I do not wish you to let them know that I have madea communication of this kind to you for I think the easiest wayto get along is for him to be counselled to come home. I havebeen in a trying place. he held the License for Emigration—the officeand every thing in his own hands and name, and to undertaketo fill my place by force, it appeared like making an explosion in the 
 without holding any meetings, or manifesting any interest in the work, for an example  I went to New Bedford whare they have upon their church Books about 100 members I gave out an appointment but did not get a dozen together, And in the organiz-ation 25 names out of the 100 was given that might still be considerd as membersof the Church. Long Island was somthing similar to New Bedford. Also Salem, & otherplaces, I might name. I can say however that I found the Majority of thebranches organized, Holding meetings, And in some instances in better conditionthan I expected to find them considering the many isms that have been afloat And thelittle attention which the church has been Enabled to bestow upon them during theirpilgraimage in the wilderness. (Philadelphia is in good condition. I had good meetingswhile there it is much the largest branch in the East the Number given me was 200yet I do not think much more than one half that number Attend at any one timeie of Members of the church. I found New York without A presiding Elder I called them to gather And Appointed Thomas Cartwright of Liverpool their presidingElder. And since that they have been in better order than they have been beforefor several years according to their Numbers, which they gave as 65. I have keptA regular list of the number of each branch of the Church in the Eastern states as faras I could obtain it, Either by visit, letters, or the report of others; And the followingis the result, which I think is correct in the Main and Embraces nearly all through-out the field of my labours, the greatest part of which I have visited. This representa-tion of 807 includes evry thing professing to have aconnexion with the church. Saints, Mormons, Hickory Mormoms Hot, warm, & cold, &c &c. I have endeavouredAs far As I could to Ascertain by inquiring into their circu-mstances their Ability to immediately gather to the westAnd by judging from the report given me that manyif not the majority of those who are in the faith had notmeans in hand to pay their fare to St Louis but my cou-ncil has been generly to them to shape their businessso as to leave for the west as soon as they could paytheir fare to that place for I feel as though the callof 16 years for the saints in the East to gather to thewest is long Enough for them to act upon it. For ifFather Holmes & many other Able men had gone to thewest 16 years ago, they might now be seen in your midstin the valley of the Mountains of Israel filled ^with^ the spiritand blessings of Zion, insstead of being in the Eastpineing away & dying.

Captain Whipple stoped with with me we Now form the 3rd Division of our company containing 26 waggons 12 of which are my own or under my immediate care & responsibility. we are in the rear of the other Divisions.The first Night after leaving the La Bonte we lost 75 Head of oxen which strayed from the [ground] in the Night which Detained us 4 days were all found but 4 Heads I purchased66 Head of oxen & 30 cows for 12 waggons each carrying about 20 Hundred I have lost but 4 Head out of that Numberas yet 2 died &  2 strayed But the fore part of our journeywas not muddy roads which was Hard upon our wholesteers their Necks were badly galled & quite a Number are Now breaking down Neck & foot sore, & failing, & we areNow finding but little feed, but I spare No pains to search for feed whare their is any prospect of finding itI am endeavoring to travel every day as far as cercumstances & the strength of our cattle will permit. I think the 1st & 2ndDivision of our company with common prosperity & the Blessings of Godwill mostly be able to reach the valley with the oxen they Have But Brother Strattan will be able to judge of it as He prefersNow as His return those of us who are in the rear are the worst off. I think according to present appearances that myself & the company with me will not be able to reach the valley with ^all^ our waggons except we could get the assistance of some 12 or 15 yoke of oxen & we should be vary thankful if any of our friends in the valley could meet us with that amountof team in the mean time we shall do our best to progressas fast as possible the first & second Divisions of our company 
 But these things have no Effect or influence against us in theminds of any whose respect is worth having, but the publiclook upon them generally as a tissue of lies as they are, getup to suit the specutlating times to gull the public & get moneyNotwithstanding this & Miss Lewis Book are circulatedthrough the country.

 Mr. PhippenSir believing you to be familliar with the wordof God & considering you willing to instruct your inferiors upponspiritual subjects, & after forming such conections of your characterI take this method to ask ^you^ several questions for information &instruction as I have no other motive in view, & should you not consider it beneath your notice to answer my questionsby writing but give me your opinions as you have formed itfrom the word of God it would be highly intresing to methe 1st is respecting the gifts that were in the ancient church the gift ofhealing the sick raising the dead casting out devils &c.2nd the sabbath & its changes.3rd & last is the subject of babtism.Firstly, while perusingthe sacred volumn of inspiration I find many wonderful workswere performed by our Saveiour, and likewise by the apostles though notby their own power, but by faith in & through Jesus Christ& if I mistake not when Christ first sent his disciples to preachthe gospel which was to the lost sheep of the house of isreal he commandedthem to heal the sick cleans the lepers rase the dead cast out devils &c.##Matthew 10|S. Mathew chap. X.## again in the last chapter of ##Mark 16|S. Mark## Christ appeared to the brethren as they sat at meat & gave them a vary forcible commandto go into all the world & preach the gospel to ev^e^ry creature he that believeth & is baptized shall be saved & he that believeth not shallbe damned & these signs shall follow them that believe in my nameshall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tonguesthey shall lay hands on the sick & they shall recover, &c this apparentlywas the last command given by our Saviour before he assended toheaven. now the question that arises in my mind is when & wharewere those gifts done away as some maintain that they are. I findno scriptures satisfactory to prove that they ever were done awaytheirfore I am led to believe that God is the same to day as in ancientdays & likewise should people at this day like as did the apostles & exercisethe faith that did Abraham in offering up his son Isaac that those giftsmight again be on the earth and in case of sickness we might loock to the Lord for deliverance in prefference of trusting to an arm of flesh. we read of a fwoman that was ill that had suffered many thingsof many physicians & had spent all that she had & was nothing better butrather grew worse which was finally healed by her faith in Christ.should light be held up to the world uppon this subject at the preasent day undouptedly their would be as little heed given to it as the Lordtold Ezekial their would be to his prophecy when he sent him to the houseof israel, yet I ask your opinion uppon the subject for information(the Lord sent Ezekiel to prophecy nowithstanding they would not hear & ought not light uppon this subject be held up even if it is not received)

 many of those who have means are prepareing to leave in the spring. Brother Havenis expecting to lead up a company from Boston At the opening of navigation. Since Ihave been on my Eastern Mission, while meeting with the saints, And teaching them thefirst Principles of the gospel, the Epistle of the Twelve, their gathering & building upZion, the signs of the, times. the gathering of the Jews, And the certain judgments of God which Await the Nations of the Earth (And further than this your servant has neither taught nor practiced) I have been filled from time to time with the spirit of God Anda deep sense of the awful judgments of A Justly Angry God which stands like astorm already gatherd And ready to burst upon the Nations of the Earth Esspecially thisNation. And I feel to offer up the gratitude of my heart to my Heavenly Fatherfor his blessing to me thus far on my mission. Elders Rockwood, Haven, Carter,Felt, Farr, Grover, And Appleby have been labouring more or less during the pastsummer & winter in these Eastern States. And they almost universally make one reportie they cannot get access to the hearts of the people, can not get them out to hear, Andif they do get a congregation together the word is like throwing A Ball against A rock,it bounds back, or like pouring water onto a gooses back it runs off, And does not pene-trate. they cannot get their bread among them, or means to travel, but have to call uponthe churches in order to live. I have generally found the same indifference manifest by the world whare I have travelled, but few come out to hear & but few have beenBaptized. I baptized 3 in New Haven, Br Rockwood 3, And Brother Applebyseveral in Philadelphia, & Cream Ridge, & several Baptized in other parts. I gaveElder Appleby council to visit the Saints in Pennsylvania & New Jersey from time to timeas he had An opportunity And preach as doors were open. The question might be asked bysome why are the people of this Nation so indifferent about hearing or Embracing the gospelwhile the work is rolling like fire in dry stubble in other Nations. I view this Nation inas bad a state at least as the Jews were After puting the saints And Jesus to death, their dayof visitation in a great measure had past. This Nation in like manner have stoned Andkilled the Prophets, shed the Blood of the Lords anointed, rejected the gospel, And driventhe entire Church And Kingdom of God with those bearing the oricles there of into theMountains of Israel, who before taking their departure with uplifted hand's to Heaven inthe Temple of the Lord, Justly cut off the Nation from the Church And Kindgdom of God,for their Abominations, wickedness And Bloody, deeds. In Addition to this since thatperiod, the sins of this Nation have Apparently increased fourfold commencing with thesin of sodomy adding Every other named in the black catalogue of crime, untill it islike A flood that overflows its banks, And it seams as though not ownly the Holy Ghostbut that portion of the spirit of God that was given to Enlighten every man that cameinto the world was taken its departure from the people, And they are going like theox to the slaughter & know not the Approach of their destruction

Could he not be among the first to get hisendowment and come over, get his money, & labour awhile in the vineyardif he could be spared out of Zion. If he cannot stop to fill a missionhe had better come and get his money if he should return immediatelyhome. I should judge there were some thousands of pounds from whatis said. 
 secondly, with respect to the sabbath we allmost universally Regardthe first day of the week as the sabbath, but when God appearedto Moses on the mount he commanded him to keep the seventhday as the sabbath & not to labour on that day, so it appears thatif their has not been a change of the sabbath we as a bobdy are notkeeping the day that we were commanded to keep, still ist is held upto view at this day that the sabbath has been changed, but is it notallowed that there has not been no change in any of these commandsthat were given to Moses at the time that the command of the Sabbath wasgiven & why has the sabbath been changed while the other commandsremain good & sacred & while we are under them & ought to obey them [##Exodus 20:8-11##]it is maintained ^by some^ that Christ rose on the first day of the week & thatthe work of Redemption was greater than the work of creation & this theyappear to consider as the change of the sabbath, but when we carefullyperuse the writings of the four Evangelist respecting the resurection ofChrist does it not appear as reasonable to suppose that Christ rose onthe seventh day as first, & even did Christ really rise on the firstday of the week, does that prove that it was a change of the sabbath& if the sabbath was changed by the resurrection of Christ would theirnot have been sumthing said respecting that change so that the evidence would have been clear that the change of the sabbath wasthen perfected. Sir this is a subject that has some length of timeocipied a seat in my mind & I lay it before you considering youhave far deeper understanding of the word of God than myself & wouldwish to know your views uppon this subject as I have not understoodthe scriptures to be varry plain respecting the change of the Sabbath.the third & last is the subject ofbabtism & ist is a subject to that has long lain with wait [weight] onmy mind I think it not ownly our duty but our highest privledgeto take the word of God & make it the man of our council & formour principles theirby still we may benifit by the instruction ofthose that are more experienced than ourselves I for one fconsidermyself transacting business for Eternity & I believe that Jesus Christset the example for the pilgraim to follow & I believe that the christianought to strive to imitate his example as near as possible (allthoughI for one come far short of it) I at times have been allmostoverwhelmed in as^s^tonishment while meditating uppon the differencesof opinion & principle that exist in our land uppon religious subjectswhen we have all the same bible to read the same spirit to directbut more especially uppon the subject of babtism, my mind haslong been [illegible] with regard to this subject still I have remainedsilent uppon the subject as I am of the opinion that every person ought tobe fully established uppon ^in^ principles uppon which much dependsI had the ordanence of infant babtism administered to me but it doesnot answer my mind for I have not found any scripture to supportit from Genesis to revelation

 I have no fears that Either the Lord or those bearing the Keys of his Kingdomon the Earth will condemn me or those who have laboured in this country duringthe past season, for not converting this Nation to the gospel considering the state ofmind they are in. Yet we have our duties to perform And that I will try to do Andcontinue to preach the gospel to all people as far as I have an opportunity.Soon After my arivel in Boston, I had an interview with Capt Joseph Russell ofMiramichi. I laid before him the Documents I recieved from Elder Richards Alsoletters from Elder Hyde sent by Elder A. Cordon, both treating upon the same subjectie Asking Aid of him to assist in paying some debts for goods deliverd to the Presidency forat Winter Quarters to assist them And those with them, &c, which I presume you understand.He said he had no means with him ownly enough to help him home; but He would considerthe subject. He laid his circumstances before me, And Asked some council. I Advised himto follow the council of the Epistle; He said He would do it. He had the keels of threevessels laid, said He would finish them; And lay no more, but sell to the best Advantage, Hecodd could & go to the valley. I found him strong in the faith. I recieved A letter fromhim A short time since. "He says "I have not yet seen any door open to make sail of myproperty but intend to sell if possible And leave for the west by midsummer. my Propertyis worth £5000 but what it will sell for I know not. "Concerning the letters you handed mefrom Brs Richard And Hyde. I will say that I do not recieve my money ownly one in a year Ican tell in March what may be as to my help on the debts"  ^March 24th I recieved A letter from BrRussell saying that He could now give a draft on a house in Liverpool for £300 for the Above object, which willbe forwarded to O Pratt to collect from him to O. Hyde to pay on the debts.^Another case I wishedto speak of. I found numbers in Boston and the regions About finding considerable faultwith Elder Allexandar Badlam for doing so much for the Church for several years past,And had become some what involved in debt. But after obtaining all the facts I couldin relation to the subject; I did not feel to condemn him, but to sustain him: for iftheir was A fault at all in his doing to much it was one that men are so seldom guilty of, that it was As good A subject for the cloke of charity as I could find. It istrue he had given to the full Extent of his means: And sometimes upon the exerciseof his faith, in all cases, where calls had been made upon him bearing thesigniture of the Presidency and seal of the church: yet he had contracted no debtownly in full faith of meeting the demand. He began with nothing, had no capitalyet his labour & business was lucrative. I do not know the exact amount of his dona-tions; But I suppose som $3000 in all since He came Here. He assisted Br Benson inmeans to help buy a mill, He bought the standard. Paid (I think) for the Press &$100 worth of type for W. W. Phelps, clothed him, & gave him other Articles, the moneyBrother Phelps collected in other branches to pay for the press, Brother Badlam thoughtwould be needed in the west. He also Assisted Brother Benson in his last collectionto help off the canp last spring, sent $600 dollars worth ^6 Barrels^ of varnish to St Louisat the same time to be sold for the benefit of the Church (But I think it yet remains unsoldAnd left his business for several weeks, went with Br.

Had a long intrview with Mr. Benson yesterday andhe exceedingly desires to do business with us he says if he does itfor nothing. I was much pleased with my interview with him. He aappears to me to be a gentleman. I think it will be well to keepupon good terms with him as far as possible.  I would life [like] to haveEmigration continue as fast as doors are open either by sea or lands,but I think it right for us to see our way vlear [clear] in chartering ships.by getting subscriptions among the Saints for that purpose beforerunning any risks, that would be detrimential to the course and adisadvantage to the Church. I like the spirit manifested by Mr.Benson with my interview with him yesterday. And as far as you can,do business with him as cheap as elsewhere. I would prefer to continuebusiness with him, as he appaarently manifests much interest in ourwelfare. I hope the Lord will open your way to get a goodly numberout by fall if not before. Bro.

 & if I may be allowed to use the expression it has been a mysteryto me how so many great divines that have been so long holding up the light of the gospel & still sometime in so gross an error withrespect to babtism, for if I am not greatly mistaken I find no accountof John or any of the apostles administering the ordinance of babtismuntill they become believers in Christ or at least untill they consideredthem true believers & that appeared to be all that was required of themin order to be babtized was to believe that Jesus Christ was the sonof God & if they spiritually believed this they must be penitent believing& respecting the mode of babtism it appears plain to me that their is noroom for one a moment to doubt but that our Saviour was buriedin babtism in the river Jordan and that all that the Apostles babtizedwere buried with Christ in babtism & setting aside evry other examplebut the one that Christ left us that alone aught to be sufficientto convince mankind that emmersion was the rite & ownly mode of babtism (to use the language of Dr. Daddridge Jesus had no sin to was[h] away & yet he was babtized and God owned this ordinance so far as to makeit a season of pouring forth the spirit uppon him & this ought to silenceevry objection to the practice.many advance the argumentthat those things are not escential but may we not with the samepropriety say that when Abraham was called to offer his suon Isaacthat it was not esesntial whether he offered his son or a lamb outof his flock & who of decided virtue will admit that the Lord wouldhave received Abraham offering with a blessing & given a blessing in return had he offered a lamb in stead of his son, & why should any believe that infant sprinkling will be as acceptable in the sight of God forbabtism as to follow the example that our Saviour hath givenhas not Christ plainly told us that he is the way ^the truth life^ & if mankind ever enter in to the kingdom of heaven must it not be by him isf sothen ought we not to obey his commands and follow his precepts & not climb up some other way.Mr. Phippen as I amconvinced of the mode of baptism, & believe it to be essential tomy prosperity & happiness the information that I wish you to communicateto me respecting this subject is whether it is against your principle & disciplineto administer the ordinance of babtism to those that you consider to beproper subjects without joining the Church for I at present am notprepared to unite ^join^ with any Church still I feel it a duty to be babtized& would wish to take up the cross when I have a fair opportunityI have premeditated a conversation with you uppon this subjectbut have delayed it as my brother is expecting to be babtized & Ihave rather been waiting for him.

I felt it my duty to be thus Particular in speaking of this case for tworeasons 1st That in case thare should be any complaint here after made against Br Badlamupon this subject (which I presume thare will not be as his debts are now mostly paid) that youmight have An outline of the facts relating to the subject As far as I have been Enabled tocollect them lying before you. 2ndly That when I give my consent, aid or council toA member of the Church to persue any course that seams to lead out of the main channellying before me I ought to give my reasons for it, that the Presidency may at one see thecause and motive, which I have endeavord to lay before you, if he is successful, in few months 
 Snow Flake, Apache Co, Arizona Aug 101: 1879W. Woodruff,Sept 1879.President John Taylor & CouncilDear BrethrenI have beenthinking for some time of addressing you andgive you an account of my Stewardship andIntentions But realizeing your hands was fullof business with Lawyers, Judges, Courts & wickedspirits. I have rather hesitated to occupy yourattention with any thinkg I had to say, but stillI feel it proper to give you an outline ofaffairs with me. I arved at Sunset on the17 May I spent some time at Sunset BrighamCity, at their sheep ^heard^, Mill & Dairy all of whichwere living in the United Order, there settlemtsin connexion with St Joseph are the ownlySettlements in Arizona who are living in the orderI feel disposed to sau a few words upon thesubject. I do not look upon them as beingperfect in Every Respect, but as they are the ownlysettlemts in the order I have felt to Sustainand Com 4 cts. The people are united & contentedas far as I could learn at Sunset. BrotherLot Smith says He has written to presidetTaylor concerning Tithing several times &has never had an Answer. He would like advice from the council to know what useto make of tithing, or how to dispose of it.It would not be profitable for the Churchto permit persons to Deposit wheat in Utah, and Draw the same in Arizona,as a Bushel of wheat is worth double in Arizona what it is Utah. I think some$1400 worth of Stock was turned out toSister Lee on the ferry at Sunset, and theother Settlemts & I think most of it onTithing. Sister Lee has got her pay that was duein stock and feels well satisfied. I had a long talkwith her at Sunset, she is Located at preset atTaylor. A few words on the United OrderTheir is a great variety of opinions, views,and minds upon this subject; some do notthink the way they are doing at Sunset proper

 Wilfords Desart 60 Miles from St Geog NevadaFeb 15 1879W. Woodruff— His hiding placePresidet John Taylor & Council,Dear BrethrenAs itcostimary for Elders to report at head quarterconce[rn]ing their Labors in thare Ministry and missionsand not considering myself Exempt from this dutyI feel like giving a short Report of my Southen MisionAs you know I accompinied Br M Thatcherto Nephi & Sanpete we had good Meetingand I think much good was done, esspeciallyin the orgainaization of the board of Trade By MosesThatcher a calling which I think He is wellqualified to fill, and I hope He will continuehis labors untill He Reaches St George. After Heleft me I was Joined at Moroni By BrotherGeorge Teesdale, and we held Meeting thoughSanpete Richfield and all the Settlementswthare we stayed over Night untill weReached St George, whare He stayed andLabored about two weeks, and got his workdone up in the Temple, and went his way RejoicingOn the ownly beadstead in the House, and theymade up a family bead on the floor with the assistanceof some beding I brought. I have spent a weekin this Barren Desert, except while reading, writing & Praying, with a gun on my shoulder RobinsonCruso like visiting ponds, and a small river tryingto kill somthing to Eat the next day, But I foundit dull music the first day I killed 1 Goose, 8 ducksand 6 quails, But that days hunting scared all thewild fowl out of the country I near killed a fowleafterwards But I was not as bad off as Nephiwas for I did not Break my Bow, and if I didnot kill any thing, the wife seared up somthing toEat so I did not go hundry. I could sccarcly keepfrom Laughing alone to myself at the change inmy condition, A man that had spent as busy a lifeas I had, and Now sevnenty two years of Age andan Apostle in the Church, and Now wanderingalone in a Desert I with a gun on his shouldermiles from Human habitation, trying to killsomthing to eat, and what all this for, if itwas not for the word of God and testimony ofJesus Christ it was for trying to keep one of thecommandmts of God, But then when Icompare my situation with the persecution andaffliction of the ancient Saints of God as well as

T. L. Greer, to occupythis extensive field. He fully beleives that grain can be raised withoutirrigation, upon those bottoms wherethe water is near the surface andbreaks forth in small springs inmany places. Bro Greer alsothinks that an abundance ofwater can be saved in a reser-voir, that ^can^ be built in a naturalbasin. I desire this subject consid-ered in connection with my former letter. The settlements hereneed these meadows for dairiesand milk ranches, but have nomen to pspare to take them upI think, if a company shouldbe sent expressly to occupy theseplaces they would take hold andbe satisfied; and do good. Somecome scattering along, and com-mence rambling around lookingfor places, these cannot be depend-ed upon to do much good.Bro Lake is fast recovering, butBro. Bates is still very sickThe sooner a company can comefor settling these desirable places,we think, the better for our peopleYour brethren in the GospelWWJesse N. Smith

 He may be enabled to return & leave the country with honor & be enabled to remove hisfamily & perhaps others to the valley: this I would be glad to see him do for I dothink that Elder Badlam has endeavord to act in consent with the Presidencyof the Church, And made a great exhertion since he has been in this country todo to his utmost to help the Church in their time of need. What I mean by themain channel lying before me is I know I was not sent to this country to gather theSaints to the gold digings of the valley of the Sacramanto. And Brother Badlamis the ownly individual who has had my council to go thare. And the reasons I^have^ given. My council has been invariably to all the Saints to go to the valley of the SaltLake via Council Bluffs. I think that Samuel Brannan, And all other men thathave reflected at all upon the subject, can now see ("without looking through A glass darkly")the wisdom of God in leading his servants the to the valley of the Salt lake to prepareA place for the gathering of the saints instead of the valley of the Sacramanto: forit appears to me from the signs of the time that this church a year hencewould have as much peace, quietness, or elbow room, in Hell, or the City of New York,as they would in the valley of the Sacramanto. When I have reflected upon thissubject in connexion with the present universal commotion of the whole Earth. And readthe Account of your safe arival in the valley, And the camp of Israel with you; And thecrops, productions, & blessings of the valley: I have felt like shouting Hosannah—xxto God And the Lamb, and to Praise the God of Israel that he has led his peoplesafely through the wilderness in the last days, And given them A quiet resting placein the rich valleys of Ephraim, in the mountains of Israel. I have also rejoicedmuch in the accounts recieved by the stars, And letters of the progress of thework throughout the British Isles under the labours of Elders, Pratt, Spencer, JonesAnd scores of Elders in that land, it indeed seams to be their day of visitationAnd the Elders are in A rich harvest of wheat, And reaping day & night. But you willget all accounts from that quarter by the Star; Elder Spencer, & those who camefrom that Land. Elder Silas. P. Barnes of Boston is now preparing to join thespring Emegration to the valley. Elder Appleby has been quite out of health duringthe past season. Elders Little & Hardy have been engaged in Merchandize at Peterboroduring the summer to try to raise means to go to the valley. Please Excuse the length ofmy communications to you at this time, it is not often I have An opportunity of forward-ing by Private conveyance direct, And I wished to speak upon A number of subjects, I shouldbe pleased to recieve any News, word, council, or communication from the Presidency at anytime, they see fit to bestow it upon me. Mrs Woodruff joins me in sending our respects toyourselves & families & the Saints in Zion we wishe Esspecially to have A place in yor prayers whenyou go Before the Lord. And that the Blessings of the Lord may rest upon you & yoursat all times And in all things is the Daily Prayer ofWilford Woodruff 
 He seemed Deeply interested in and seemed to understand it much better than I could have expected. He insistedon my going home with him to Forest- Dale and telling pedro the peace Chief of the Natives. I went home with him and had a Meeting with Pelone & Pedro the two main Cheiefs of the NationsI was thankful for the opportunity the spirit of God Rested upon us all. Petone Rehearsed to Pedro all I had taught him in the Mountains, and they both seemed Highly Delighted they both wantto go to Salt Lake & see the City and the great Chief. If they go Brother Ebenezar Thayne will accompany them. If they do go I hope attention may be paid to them that they may have a talk with the president & council, and may be furnishedwith a suit of cloths. I must say I am struck with Wonder at the great inter-est faith confidence & hope that the Chiefswhen any one, joins them they turn in all the property they have good, bad or indifferent all is priced by a committy, & named what itis, if He wishes to leave, all the samye property He turned in is returned to him if it exhists in the same shape, if not, its Equivilent, some think that all property turned in should draw an interest of 5 or 10 pr cts, have a $1 a day for their work, draw out of the Store House, cook & live at home, & make a Dividend at the End of the year where this has been tried one Man comes with $5000, a wife & 3 children, another poor man comes with $100, a2 wives, & 15 children, at the End of the year the Rich man has a large surplus & the poor Man in Debt all over, and all who has tryed the system have soon had to break up. And I have thought that while there were some settlements living in the Utnited OrderIn union & prosperity it was better to let them remain, and work as they were than to break them up by introducing a new system among them. And let other New Settlements be organized on the

 Indian [Mission]Sunset, Apache Co., Arizona,Sept. 15th, 1879.President John Taylor and Council:Dear Brethren:I arrived on Saturday night, the 13thinst., all well and in good spirits and found Brother Lake, of Brig-ham City and Brother Btates, of pleasant Vallety, very sick. They hadbeen to the Verdie, baptizing some and administering to the sick.Brother Lake has been looked upon as dangerous, but was some betteryesterday.In my short communication of the 2nd inst., I promised to givea more full account of my visit to the Islatus, which I will now en-deavor to do. I view my visit amontg the Nephites one of the mostinteresting missions of my life, although short. I say Nephites, be-cause if there are any Nephites on this continent we have found themamong the Zunies, Lagoonies and Islatus, for they are a differentrace of people altogether from the Lamanites. I class the Navajoe,Moquie and Apaches with the Lamantiites, although they are in advanceof many Indian tribes of America. I class the Zunies, Lagoonies andIslatus among the Nephites. (See Sec. 3, 17 verse, D. & C.). TheZunies are in advance of the Navajoes, Apaches, or any other Laman-ites. The Lagoonies are much above the Zunies, and the Islatus arefar above them all in wealth, in beauty, cleanliness and order oftheir homes and persons, the adornment of their dwellings, their in-dustry and indefatigable labors, the virtue and purity of their na-tiojnal blood, their bearing and dignity in their intercourse withstrangers and, above all else, the expansion of their minds and cap-ability of receiving any principle of the Gospel, lof endowments orsealing powers, fully equal to the mind of any of the Anglo Saxon 
 those Settlements to the Bishop, as their is no other Grist Mill in 100 Miles of our settlements it leaves the tithing wheat 50 75 or more miles from the Mill and asthey are in a New County No conveniences for storeing tithing grain. It will cost the Church or some body sumthing to bring this tithing grains 75 Miles to Mill would it not be better for the people to bring back the wheat to the Mill where they got the flour from. We would like some instructions upon these subjects. A man applyed to me from Logan ^Sipeo^ to Deposit wheat there I draw tithing here I told him I would name it to you but one busheh of wheat here is worth two there. I wish to say that Br Lake is at work again. Brother Bates getting Better, we have administered to them by annointing with oil & lying on of hands and they both have been healed.  I have just received a letter from J Jaques  stating that you are having a land rains we have who had oneSunset Apache Co Arizona Oct 17, [18]79 President John Taylor & CouncilDear BrothersWe received the Deseret News containing the account of the settlement of the heir suit against the Executors and Trustee and the Decisions of the Court in the case and it truly caused our hearts to rejoice for there has never has been a more vexatious suit enacted in this Church, as far a Dollars & cents were concerned, and it has Gained me moreanxiety while spending than any other subject,and I know it has the Council at home. It has been the labor of my prayers Daily before the Lord, and I feel to thank God it has closed so well. I do not begrudge the 7 Heirs what they will get in the settlement for I would not have to pay the bills & meet the reward they will receive both in this world & the world to come for ten thousand times what they have got, but I feel to thank the Lord that your end liberated out 
 President Taylor and CouncilDear Brethren:I want to say a few wordsupon temporal matters. In my former lettersI stated the opinion of the brethren that thecompany from Farmington could come toArizona better in Febuary and March, butthe times admonish us that nobody can comein the winter at all. They will be under thenecessity of waiting untill spring untill thegrass grows, before which time niether teamsnor stock can travel. We would be gladfor early emigration for the purchase of SaintJohns needs both men and means to hold it. We are also about purchasing the smallupper ditch, water and land which we couldnot get when we made the other purchase.We baptized one of the mexicans at St. Johns,an honest man apparently and zealous in theGospel. I ordained him an elder and gavehim instructions and quite a number of themexicans at St. John attended our meeting atthe mexican brothers house and brothers Tenneyand Nail preached to them in Spanish and our

An Excellent work in theTemple is still kept up, the Brethren and sisters are wellunited who labor there, there were over 100 Endowtmentsgiven daily a portion of the time I was there. I felt impresdto hasten up my own work while I was there soon the 5 Feb I was sealed at the alter for 76 coupleof my dead friends.

 them untill sumthing better can be advisedI have spent more time at Sunset than either of the other settlemts. I can speak more advisedly than of the others. I think Sunset has proved itself a success in a tempory as well as spiritual point of view. Brother Lot Smith who is the presidet of the stake, takes the lead in the work does as much hard work as any man in the Branch faires No better than the poorest, and I think has produced a good deal more for the support of the people than any settlemt in the Mountains accordingto the Number Employed. They as did Brigham City lost hundreds of bushels of wheat by the flood last year, yet almost Evry Mormon Settlemet in Arizona have Depended upon Lot Smith for their bread for the last six months before harvest. He has distributed to the Saints during the year I think from 15 to 20 Tons of flour & meal. and done it freely. & when I left Sunset on the 29 July Br Lot Smith had but 150 Acres of good ripe plump wheat which I think I am safe in saying that it would20 bushels to the Acre, & had 55 Acres more to cut the latest they had & the best, that will yield 40 bushels to the Acre, total of the wheat crop 5200 Bushels And he has but 11 Men & boys at work on the farm, and he has over 100 Acres of corn looks well, 30 of cane, 20 of Lucern & some 15 Beets carrots & other vegitables, all his other Men are at work at the waggon, Blacksmithssheep Heard, Steam Saw Mill, & Dairy quite a settlement at the Mill & Dairy. The crops at Brigham City are not near as good but what they haveare in the ben. They have cut their Early ^Sonora^ Sonora wheat at St Joseph, rather light 15 bushels to the Acre, later wheat Better, their corn & Garden very good. Wheat at Snow Flake half cut a fair crop. corn & vegitables at Sholo Creek Read Head & Easts very good, corn & potatoes at Father Cluffs looks well. corn & vegitables at Forest Dale half a crop. No Irrigation last year a great crop there. Mr Cooley a friend to Mormons & Indians (having an Indian wife) will raise 150000 lbs of Barley. Barley sells at 5 cts

 of the Trouble and that the Temples & Church property are safe. I did not see John W Young name in the list with the rest of the family for I did not learn whether He signed the paper Br Roseton took to him or NotThere is a question I wish to ask the Trustee in trust Would it not be wisdom for Lot & Jesse N Smith or those who preside over these Stakes of Zion to have the privilege of selling some of the tithing wheat & turning it into Money instead of keeping the wheat would not the Money be of more Benefit to the Trustee under the present state of Church affairs than to keep the wheat on land flour can be cashed at the Mill for $6 a bushel or wheat at $2 a bushel which is Double the price of wheat in Utah Application is made to Lot Smith for flower but He did not feel at Liberty to sell any tithing flour without the Court of the Trustee I havebeen applyed to upon the subject and Ido not feel it my place to take any Respon-sibility upon myself concerning tithing Money or grains any further than to assist in regulating the prices of tithing of this County for the benefit of the Church. Some of the Bishops offered me thithing Money I told them to Deliver it to the presidents of the Stakes who should forward it to the Trustee the earliest opportunity, if I was going to Salt Lake direct, I would take any tithing Money & Deliver it to the proper proper Authority on My arival as I at times have done. Jesse N Smith has takensome tithing money with him as He is going to the Legislature. There is another thing I wish to say Lot Smith has loaned a good Deal of flour or grains to people through Arizona during the past year to feed them they were to return this back to the Mill The Trustee probably not understanding the situation I understand has given the people the privilege of turning in their wheat in 
 mexican brother has baptized 5 of them anda prospect of more. I think there is a fair prospect of an effectual door opening inArizona to bring many of the Mexicans pop-ulation into the Church. They are of coarse a good deal mixed with the Indian blood.We recieved a letter to-day from brother HaskelHe had arrived safe at San Juan after en-countering huricanes and snow storms. Hefound only 2 men and 3 women and 8 child-ren in the settlement, and they had a frightfrom a report that the Utes was coming todestroy all on the river, but they did not do it. Soon 3 men arrived from Silas SmithsCompany. they were still hemmed up and couldnot travel, no road, had to blast thier waywith powder of which they were out. They saidit would take 300 lbs. more powder to blowthem into the river and out again and SilasSmith had gone back to obtain the powder toaccomplish it. It seems quite a mistakefor companies to undertake to travel a roadwith women and children in the winter, that hasnot been explored. I think we should avoida repetition of it. I have heard the new boatwas in the river at Lee's Ferry. I am gladto hear it. I wish president Taylor andCouncil would change the name of that ferry.I do not like the name. If it was changedperhaps there might not be as many Ghostsvisit it and scare the women as there has been in days that are past. There has beenstrange stories told by the sisters who havebeen to work there. We are beginning tohave cold weather in Arizona of late. Thermom-eter has been showing for several morningspast from zero to 6 degrees below which is an uncommon thing for this country. Iexpect Sunset people will finish threshingtomorrow. Head to go to Snowflake andborrow thier machine as the Clawson ma-chine refuses to do any more threshing thisseason. They will have about 3200 bushels,which is less than what I expected, yet 2/3 ofall the Mormons of Arizona are looking tothese figures for thier years bread. It shouldread 13000 in order to feed them untillharvest. But Sunset are doing all they canfor the needy.

 race. While I have been standing in the midst of that noble mindedpeople, teaching them the Gospel, I could not make myself believe Iwas standing in the presence of American Indians or Lamanites, neitherwas I. The Islatus of which I speak is a village twelve miles be-low Albequirke, on the Rio Del Norte, containing 3000 souls thatstand at the head of this class of men that I calol the Nephites.They occupy forty villages, containing a population of 32,000, speak-ing sixteen distinct languages, but nearly all good Spanish scholars.I look upon this as a great field of missionary labor for some fortygood, faithful "Mormon" Elders, who should be able to speak theSpanish, and I hope next Conference will call some of them, at least,into the field. I visited this people, located in their homes, incompany with Brother Ammon M. Tenney, who had visited most of thembefore and I think has done much good in opening doors among them.He had baptized 115 of the Zunies on a former mission. My journeyand visit with him was a visit of observation and I was amply paid.In what way, I do not know, but in almost ebvery village I visited,they were looking for me. I can only make a brief outline from my journal of our journey. On the 19th of Auguast, we entered the Zunievillage, containing about 3000 souls. The village stood on a pieceof ground; many buildings three stories high, the upper stories en-tered by ladders at the top. There had been a heavy struggle inthis village between the Catholics and Mormon Zunies. The priestshad done all they could to lie about the Mormons and had drawn awaya few who had been baptized, but others remained firm. I wentthrough the old Catholic cathedral in the village; it looked asthough it were 500 years old. It had two bells hanging in the towerand over the pulpit was some of the finest carved work in wood I

I got to first days rep^or^t of the conference and read the speaches of the Twelveand I can say with evry sentiment of my heart Amen.

 Dividend on other systems as they can agree. I think the majority of those in the other settlemets Rather incline to live on the Individual systems, ratherthan to coop on United order systems. I have of Late been holding meetings & visiting the Saints at Snow Flake, Bagley Sholo Creek where Read Head & E. W. East lives & to Cluff Settlement, & Forest Dale fair Caspsrops growing in all the settlements. On the 1 Aug. I was invited by several of the Brethrn to Accompany Petone the war Chief of the Apaches in the forest on a hunt As it was the first time I had a chance to form an aquaintace with An Apache Chief I thought it wisdom to accept of the invitation, so I spent 3 days with him & 7 other Indians, with Brothers ReadHead East, & Thayne, I followed petone one day on his hunt He painted & striped himself with clay like An Antilope Had a small shirt painted like an Antilopput an Antelope skins head & horns on his head, was then prepared for a hunt. When he saw an Antelope or Deer He would dismount get on the ground approach his game on his hands & knees and in Evry instance draw his game to him and shot Evry one He see Having killed 27 in this way During the 3 days One days Hunt was sufficient for me for I had to run my home 20 miles the first forenoon to keep up with him or be left in the forest, and when he had 350 lbs of venison with himself on his horse it did not cause him break his gallop. We had prayers with him Morning & night and I had a long talk with him at the camp fire with a good interpetor and taught him concerning his forefathers, their Record the Gospel Our Relationship to them their future Destiny and as far Ias I felt it Wisdom to communicate all of which

I wish tosay that it does not appear to me to be prudent forme to attempt to appear openly at the April Confercein Salt Lake, and if I am not with you in personI certainly shall be in spirit. I feel well, I have nofears of any thing if we do our duty.

I feel that I can say Amenwith Every sentiment of my heart, to every principlecontained in Either of them. It certainly wouldhave been a satisfaction to me, and I presume It wouldhave been to you to have attended the conferenceat Logan, but Wisdom Dictated otherwise, andwe have to be satisfied. Your position is ownlyfollowing in the footsteps of the prophet Josephin his day. I have felt for a good while thatthere was a change coming over Zion, over ourNation, and over Great Babylon. And this inorder to fulfill the Revelations of Divine truthand to carry out the purposes of the Lord. I cannotbut acknowledge the hand of the Lord in the presentafflictions of the Latter Day Saints. The persecutionof the Righteous by the wicked is a legacy bequeathedto all Saints in Every age of the world and willcontinue untill Christ reigns on the Earth.And while all the powers of the Earth are combinedwith the powers of Darkness and of Evil to Destroythe Latter Day Saints from off the Earth it shouldbe a strong testimony to not ownly the Saints butto sinners that the God of Heaven had set hishand to Esstablish his Church and Kingdom on the Earthin righteousness. I have felt at times asthough I wanted to get out to meeting andspeak to the people in thes southern settlementsbut there is a Commissioner and several DeputyMarshals appointed in this District and if I getinto the hands of my Enemies I should not havethe Liberty I now Enjoy. I lost my friend WilliamSquire with whom I have spent most of my timefor 7 months. He was sick 10 days.

 ever saw, representing Christ, the apostles and angels. I went allthrough the village and, for the first time in my life, I had a viewof the white Indians called Albinos. Their hair, face and limbswere nearly as white as milk, much whiter than any Americans. I metwith many who had been baptized and they were very glad to see me.They had 2000 acres of corn, looking well without irrigation. XOn theday following, we visited their bvillage at their farm clalled FishSprings. I was here introduced to Brother Juan Boulista (John Bap-tist), the first man baptized in the Zunie nation by A. M. Tenney.His son's wife was the most handsome woman I ever saw of the Indianrace; had a beautiful child, nearly white. I went through theirwheat fields, which they were ciutting with sickles. We visited sev-eral ruins of the ancient inhabitants; some of the outside walls ofstone were standing some eight feet high. On Sunday evening, the25th, we held a meeting in a village of the Lagoonies, called MositaNegra. We had an interesting talk with the Governor of the place(Jose Carido) and the spiritual advisor (Lorenzo Coreo) and bothwanted a meeting, and they called the people together, men, women andchildren. We opened by singing and prayer and Brother Tenney spoketo them in Spanish thirty minutes. I spoke a short time. BrotherTenney interpreted and we dismissed, thinking we had kept them longenough. As soon as we dismissed, a Nephite arose, full of the Spirit of the Lord, and said, "Friends, why do you dismiss us andleave us in this way. This is the first time we have heard of ourforefathers and the Gospel, and the things we have looked for fromthe traditions of our fathers. If our wives and children are weary,let them go home; we want to hear more. We want you to taklk allnight, do not leave us so." This speech raised me to my feet and

Brother Thatcher has sent me his correspondence withyou upon the subject of the Young Men's Mutual ImprovementAssociations. I have read his letter and your answer, also hisreply to the same, and I have tried to carefully study themall, and I must say there are some things in yours andBrother Cannon's letter that I am surprised at, and as theSuperintendent of the Young Men's Institutions, I feel itmy duty to reply to it.In the first place, permit me to say that while I viewall earth and hell, including our own government, in every department, with priests, editors, wicked men, anddevils all combined to crush us, as the Church and kingdomof God on earth, with all our institutions, as far as theyhave the power; while I view this at our doors, and knowthat nothing can save us but the power of God, I feelthat the Twelve Apostles should have the most implicitconfidence in the First Presidency of the Church, and

It is on file at the H. O and the date is not before me, and the excuse I have to offer in not answering before isthe death and buriel of my wife Phoebe and the settlement of my affairs after the buriel which in some respects was in an unpleasantcondition; and also being under the necessity of moving by night from place to place for my own safety. Therefore I trust this may be a sufficient excuse for my seemingly neg-lect on my part. I must confess it gave me peculiar feelings to return to Salt Lake where I had spent thirty-five years and built four dwelling houses and now I find not a place to lay my head. I could not attend the funeral of my wife with which I had spent about fifty years in the marriage covenantThe only privilege I had in the matter was to look through a window at the H. O. and see the prosession pass and view the hearse that carried the mortal tabernacleI will say I have had several copies of theletter written and sent to E. Snow, M Thatcher,and have been read to the Bretheren hereand will endeavor to do all I can in havingthe counsel carried out. I did not know thatthe Suprientendants of the Improvement associa-tions had been called upon to call men in-to the missionary field. I enquired of Bro. Franklinabout the matter and he said he had calledupon the Presidents of two stakes to supply calla certain number of men as missionaries andthey had not made out the number calledfor, and ^Bro Richards^ he asked two suprientendants to presentthe names of some of the most suitable men tothe President of the stake for his approval, and that none have been called only upon the ap-proval of the President of the stake. I am verygood health and spirits at the present timeand am using the best wisdom I posessto take care of myself. I do not move at anypoint only in the night.The funeral of my wife was watched andinquiries have made by marshalls if I wasin the City. I pray that the blessing and peaceof God may be with you, and that the Lordmay deliver you from all your enemiesI remain Your brother in the gospelWilford Woodruff

In fact I have of late had a very strong Missionary spirit Resting upon me esspecially to go to the Laman-ites for I feel that the Lord is at work with them, and It seems as though I had providen-tially fallen in company with ^a great many of^ the Navajoe— Moque & Apache Chiefs and I have felt inspired to preach to them. And as I now have an oppertunity of visiting the Zunis and Istatus tribes with good Interpetors I feel that I cannot spend my time to any better Advantage. Brother Tenney is at Savoia will come to Round Valley forme. We have a few men that have the nameof Mormon, who came to Arizona ^without^ withtRecommends and dont want any, did not come to serve God or build up Zion, but to serve themselfves, they would have been better to have staid at home some of them have gone back and it would be well if others would go but they are not many the people as a general thing are trying to live their Religion I think Broth Jesse N. Smith is doing very will, has many good Saints to preside over. Br Wm J. Flake is a doing a great Deal for Zion & the poor. I think He has fed tons of flour to the Arkansas Saints, and others who are Destitute and He has bought from $15000 to $20000 dollars worth of Ranches in Arizona for the Saints to Settle on I have been almost afraid He would swamp himself in the operation. But I feel as though I had said about Enough about affairs in Arizona for the present We have had some Rains in the country Enough to put out the fires that have

I hope they may be found worthy to obtain PresidentTaylor's signature.I saw the account of the arrest of Bro Budge.The Government officers do not seem to pay anyattention to principles of law or equity indealing with our people.I have been somewhatsurprized at the tardiness of some of ourpeople in Registering, when the liberties ofthe people depend so much upon them.But I hope enough will register to keep thepolitical control.I feel that we have much reason to thankthe Lord for the manner He has over-ruledthe Edmunds-Tucker Bill, in its final passage,which has taken the power out of the hands ofour enemies to rob us of office and propertyaccording to its original intent.I am pleased to learn that Bros John W.Young and Nibley and others are making themselvesuseful in Washington, and that we still havean army of missionaries ready to laboramong the Gentiles in the various nations ofthe earth. I think it is our duty to sowarn the Gentiles, that they shall be left 
 It does appear to me that I have never Readin the whole history of the World anyNation taking such rapid strides to prepairthemselves for the Judgments of God as arethe United States to day. whole pages ofthe publications of the day are taken up inthe recitation of their Dredful Murder, rapesand the Abominations of the Earth, and allthe government officers who are sent to admin-ister Justice to the Saints seem in a terriblehurry to fill up their cup of iniquity. They arefilled with madness, and Act mo[r]e likeDemons than wise men to Judge the peopleby Law and Equity. And I am sorry to say thatI am not able to see any saving or Redeemingquality in any Department of our GovernmentThe Supreme Court the president, The CabinetThe Congress or the Majority of them seem com-bind to destroy the Saints of God from offfrom the Earth, and their is a great meen-ing to all this And no man possessing thespirit of God, and of inspiration can help butobserve the signs of the times and of beholdingthe Dreadful Storm which is approachingour Country and the Nations of the EarthThe Lord is not slack concerning his promisesfor what He promises He will fullfill, his wordswill not pass away. fifty four years ago lastJanuary a few Saints in Ohio prayed the Lord to stayhis Hand in Judgment. He said He could notDeny his word. If the people would Repentof their sins He would stay his hand in Judgmentbut not without. I think the present Generationsare far from itRepentance. I feel the force ofyour Remarks in the Epistle to myself and my Brethrenthe Apostles, of the great responsiblity which Restsupon us. And while I am shut up like a cagedLion, and cannot open my mouth in the congregationsof the Saints or sinners. I am strongly Reminded ofthe word of the Lord to the Elders of Israel on the 11 Sept 1836 when He says "If you believe me youwill labor while it is called to day" Again we aretold that soon night will come when No man canwork. When I look around myself and ask whereare the ph prophets and Apostles who laid the foundationof this Church and Kingdom on the Earth, with whomI was associated in Kirtland and Nauvoo. They aregone, gone into the spirit wor[l]d, where I shall soonfollow, and there are but few left of thos daysothers have taken their places, but it matters not ifwe have done our duty. But I fear that manytimes as Elders of Israel, We do not Realize thegreat responsibility which Rests upon uswhile we hold in our hands in a measure thedestiny of the souls of men in the generation inwhich we live Jesus has told us it is ourprivilege to know the signs of the coming of the Sonof Man It does appear to me that the signs of bothHeaven and Earth indicate his coming. And lookingupon the other hand it appears as though there wasa great amount of work to be performed before that Event-ful day. Still the Lord is able to cut his work short 
 that they should have confidence in the Twelve Apostles,and that we should be united both in faith and works, to bethe better prepared to steer the ship of Zion through the terriblestorm that is approaching us. I will here say that I have endeavored to sustain all the authorities of the Church,over me, from the day I came into the Church until thepresent hour, and I expect to still continue to do this du-ring the few remaining days I have to stay on earth, andI have no disposition to do otherwise; and whatever thehead of the Church decides for us to do concerning the Mu-tual Improvement Associations, for one, I shall endeavorto carry it out to the best of my ability. But I feel it myduty as Superintendent of the institutions, to express myviews on the subject, for if there is any thing wrong con-nected with this matter, I feel that the responsibility, ina measure, rests on my shoulders.President Taylor, I will confess I was startled at theidea that you had discovered that the institution wasforming a separate body from the Church and holypriesthood, and was belittling the priesthood, or that itwas not an institution organized by the priesthood; forI have always understood from the history of the institutionthat it was organized and directed in the beginning from 
 with the exception of a slight cold. I am stilla free man, but do not know how long Imay be, but shall endeavour to do the bestI can.

 of my wife to her last resting place, as faras the body was concerned, but this is the lot of an elder in our day; but one thing I may be thankful for is this. I arrived in time to see her while alive. I spent one day and night with her. The evening before I met with you I felt impressed to call upon her and did so with Brother Jacques and Beulah present. I anointed her for her buriel.Pheobe seemed to marvel at what I was doing, not realising that she was so near her end, after anointing her I laid my hands upon her and blessed her and bid her good bye, and sent my love to my friends in the spirit world: aAnd left her for the last time. She died at two o'clock about eight hrs. after. I did not see her after she was deadI prayed to the Lord in the begining to sustain me through what I saw and was com-ing to pass which he did do in a wonderful manner. I could not have believed I could have lived and passed through such a scene with the same composure, calmness, andserenity and reconciliation of mind as I did through her death and burial, and not shed a tear for while my wives and children were bowed down with sorrow, I had to hold themup through this trying ordeal. This in connec-tion with my first meeting with eleven of the Apostles. aAfter greeting each other we entered into the labor of the examination and trial of Albert Carrington which lasted from seven o'clock till four in the morning, all of which had a tendancy to depress the spirits of almost any man without being supported by the power of God. I will close this part of my subject by saying that I felt perfectly recon-ciled to the departure of my wife. cConsidering her bodily condition I believe it far better for her to go to rest than to remain any lon-ger amidst the troublesome times.I felt sorry to learn last evening of the arrest of Bro Lorenzo Snow. It looks to me that he was imprudent in spending so much time with his wife Minnie in that Brick house, when any anall acquianted with his cus-tom knew that he had made that place almost exclusively his home. It is true that I and others of my brethren may fall into the hands of our enemies not withstanding the precautions we may take.

 the next hour was one of the best meetings we had. We all felt in-spired, missionaries, Nephite men, women and children. I spoke andBirother Tenney interpreted. I never felt the want of tongues morethan on this occasion. I taught the things of the kingdom of Godand found hearts capable of receiving it. All were deeply interest-ed and the seeds we had sown in the hearts of that people will bringforth fruit. At the close of the meeting, the man who spoke in the meeting came to me and said, "WHhen you return, drive to my home andall your wants will be supplied, (which we did do and held anothermeeting on the Sunday following, and should have baptized him and theGovernor and many others, I think, if the Governor who had followedus as did the spiritual advisor, some sixty miles to Islatus and hadnot returned and the people did not wish to take any steps until theirGovernor was with them.) On the following morning, my carriage wassurrounded by the Governor and people that we had talked to the nightbefore and some of them took breakfast with us and I had to talk tothem on the principles of the Gospel and their record and signs ofthe times, until I left, and the leading men of the village foollowedus sixty miles to Islatus and stopped with us most of the time wewere there.

The Zion, Church, & Kingdomof God will come off triumphantin the End but how much suffering& tribulaton the Lord will permitto come upon the Saints is not forme to say I think I Realize that 
 the highest authority in the Church, and has been encouragedby the Apostleship from time to time, including PresidentTaylor. President Cannon has heard me express myself inplainness before large congregations of young people, that therecould be no organization in the Church, which could have a separate interest from the kingdom of God and from theHoly priesthood. I said the Primary, sabbath school,Improvement Associations, Relief society, or any quorumof the priesthood, could have no separate interests, or organizaton,or independence outside of the Holy priesthood and governingauthority of the Church and Kingdom of God. These weremy sentiments then, are now, and will be to my grave.I will say that I have never taught, have never heard anyother person teach, in the Young Men's ImprovementAssociation, any word that would have a tendency todraw them away from the Priesthood, or make them independent of it, or belittle the Priesthood. The very factthat three Apostles preside over it, and that the Stake Superin-tendents are High Priests, and many of the other officersand members possess the Priesthood, would entirely forbidsuch a thing.With regard to the Young men's Mutual Improve-ment Association turning their meetings into the various

I have writtento Brother Tenney upon the subject of the MissionI travelled with Brother Tenney in 1879, in visiting severaltribes of Indians including the Zunies, Lagoonies & Islata I consider him Well qualified to Lead a Mission amo^n^gthe Lamanites who understand the spanish Language. Hecan preach about as well in that as in the English, Heseemed to have the spirit of the Mission while I was with him. I told him if He would commence hismission with the Maricopas, Pemas, & Papagoes, who arenear the Yaquis, that it would be Well, as several ofther Chiefs who visited you in Salt Lake have been baptizedand many of ther Members. We have a school Esstab-lished with the Maricopas. These tribes named are anagricultural people they Raise a great deal of wheat, I donot think Brother Tenny could find a better field. He says his imprisionment has left him in poor circumst-ances financially. I Also informed him that youwould not object to granting his request upon theother subject.

I came downto the Temple last Evening to attend to the Marriage ofEdward Snow the son of Erastus, as his Father was not athome to attend to it, he requested me to, which I did thismorning. I had a plesant interview yesterday withR. T. Burton & E. F. Sheets who are here on Church businessI also had an interview with Elder Roberts who done mostof the preaching at the conference, & people were much EdifiedI also had an interview with Jacob Hamblin. I gave hima mission to the Lamanites as he is not allowed to stay at homeand his mission has been to the Lamanites for many yearsand he seems better qualified for that mission than to the gentiles.There was a Telegram sent here from Beaver saying that somebodyhad told Marshal Armstrong (A cock & bull story) that I withThurber Spencer Bagly & others had threatened to throw Armstrong& his papers into Fish Lake if He came there to Arest any body.there was No such threats made, nor truth in it. But there was aman in Beaver (said to be a Reporter) took it up, and has tryed to makesome black mailing out of it. But president Murdock has beencommunicated with to ^see^ Armstrong, and correct the matter with him,for we have all of us but the best of feelings with him as A Govern-met Officer, for he has behaved more Gentlemanly than any otherone in the service. I think it will be setled without Difficultybut this caused me to leave the Room I have occupied of late,and I went back to my old retreat whare I had spent severalmonths. And I found my old friend vary sick, and next morningclensed & purified. The Saints tried & proven, when the cup of iniquityof those who are persecuting the ^saints^ is filled, and when the United StatesGovernment is Ripe for the Harvest, And it does appear tome I never saw a field ripen as fast. Brethren youhave my prayers Day and night for your health, prosperity, anddeliverance President Taylor has once suffered Marterdom If ^it^ is the Will of God I pray that may suffice. If those wicked men had youin their possession, They would never want to let you go alive.And I pray you may be kept out of ther hands.

Allthe Saints of God around me wish to send Love & blessingsWith regard to myself I thank the Lord I am able to sayI am Enjoying good health to day considering my Age andclose confinement.

 Quorum meetings, I will say I have felt for a good while that thevarious quorums of the Priesthood do not live up to their privilegesin meeting together as they should, and getting the spirit oftheir calling and mission upon them. But the YoungMen's Associations have gathered together hundreds if not thou-sands in their meetings that have no priesthood, and todaywould be mingling with the wicked if they had not beengathered to the meetings of the Young Men's Associations.Then there are hundreds of the better class that have no priest-hood, and belong to no quorum, and would not attendthe quorum meetings. Now I did not knowthat you had any objections to the conferences of the YoungMen's Associations, only upon the ground that theyinterfered with the Sabbath schools. I did not knowthat Brother Cannon had any objection, only on thatground. Now the Sabbath Schools hold their unionsonce a month, and they are of vast interest, and amongthe most interesting meetings in the mountains, andhave a great influence for good among the rising gene-ration. But if these meetings were stopped I think itwould be an immense injury to the Sabbath Schools

 time He has been engaged in Mining in consequenceof his having to Leave. Philo Farnsworth of Beaverhas taken the advantage of his situation and Jumpedhis mine; And Farnsworth told one of the Brethrenthat He intended to get Croff before the Grand Jury andthey would place him where He could not defend him-self before the Court, as the Marshals have offered $100 forCroff. And as Croff could not go to Court the case wastried before the High Council in Beaver and when it wasinvestigated it was clearly proven that Croff had fulfilledall the Law Required. But president Murdock Decided infavor of his Son in Law Philo Farnsworth. On the groundthat Br Croff was not a Bonded Officer. He said if Croff hadgiven bonds as the Recorder of the Mining District He would havedecided in his favor, so He took the Mine away fromCroff & gave it to Farnsworth. I look upon it as a varypoor Excuse for Rendering such a Decision. 5 of the 12Counsellors voted against his Decision I Read a copy of the Records of the decision. In my mindthe cause of Farnsworth towards Croff borders upon aCriminal Action in laying a plan to get Croff into the handsof the Marshal so he could steal his mine, and depriveCroff of the power to defend himself. He could not have defended himself before the High Council in Beaver withoutBeing Arested, his Brother done the best He could He wantedto Appeal the case to the first presidency, But He has toleave the County in the case of poligamy.

 cost $1000.00. There was much more wealth than I would have lookedfor in as obscure a place as Albequirke. We spent the day in theplace and left in the evening and camped five miles below on thebanks of the river. On the 27th of August, we entered the villageof Islatus (Ysleta), being the day before the great annual feast ofthis people. Brother Ammon M. Tenney had visited this people threeyears ago and had madde friends in the place. We called upon an ioldpatriarch that had received him before. His name was Juan Reylocero(John King). He was golad to receive us. He furnished us withmutton, fruit and anything we needed. He was one of the leadingspirits and most influential men ofin the village over 80 years of age,but his labor and activity did not show 70. It should be understoodthat the Catholic power has had dominion for centuries over most ofthe American tribes. This is the case with all these tribes, as wellas others, and the priests who now occupy their villages are mostlyFrench or Italian. The priests who dwell in Islatus has had a hardcontest with the old patriarch, because he had received the Mormonsand their religion. He told the priest that he had his own rightsand agency and no men should take his rights or religion from him,and they had not spoken to each other for two years, and this spiritis manifest through all the tribes when the Gospel is preached andthe Lamanites and Nephites throughout all the land are beginning tobe weary of the Catholic priests and their religion. The inhabit-ants of Islatus stand at the head of these 32,000 Nephites; all theother 40 villages come to them for counsel. They have their ownlaws, police courts and judgment seat. They are very rich. Theman we stopped with possessed 9000 sheep, 100 brood mares and horses,100 mules and asses, 500 cows and oxen, a ranch worth $8000.00, and 
 and a suicidal policy for us to require it.Now, brethren, my thoughts have run in this chan-nel. You have 50,000 Sunday School children in Utah.Now are these 50,000 children going to remain children?No. They are going to become young men and women, andI ask myself, is it a wise policy for us to fetter them anddeprive them of remaining in the improvement Associa-tions, where they can advance? If we do, it appearsto me, it would be just as unwise as it would be to stopthe meetings of the Sabbath School children. I think itwould be a great injury to our young men and women.I have never known the Sunday School presidents or teachersto attempt to form a separate interest from the Churchand Priesthood. Neither have I the Mutual Improve-ment Associations. The object of the Conferences of theYoung people is to encourage each other, and I thinkthey have done a great deal of good. I will confess thatmy circumstances have not been such that I couldattend or meet with as many of these conferences of theMutual Improvement Associations as I could wish.I have always endeavored to attend them when circum-

In consequence of his sickness I have Returnedback to the Room I left whare I am now stoping (Except today in theTemple) The most Exciting News we had was the Dispatcher sayingthat Bishop John Sharp had taken the same course that Arnoldhad. It was a shock the people had not looked for, I should havelooked for it in Many other Men before him. I would rather havebeen shot Dead and let my body Rest in the Tomb and my spirit Enterthe spirit world free, so I could look the Lord in the face & the Prophets& Apostles with a clean conscience instead of meeting that terribleHell that such men will have to face. Of course the ring andTribune will now glory in such a Victory, but his joy will notbe great, but his sorrow will. For a man with the knowledge &opportunity that John Sharp has, for him to agree to deserthis family to carry out the Dictation of such courts as now reign andbreak the Covnents He has made with his family, his friends & his GodHe will meet sorrow such as he does not now comprehend. I wouldrather be struck with Lighting, And I would Rather Evry son I haveon Earth would be struck Dead than to persue such a coursefor imprisionmet & Death are light compared with that Hellsons of perdition have to meet. whare is the man in Heavenor on Earth who dare meet that Doom. No man Dare do itwho has Enough of the spirit of God, and Inspiration to see thefuture. I pray the Lord with all my imperfections that I may neverbe left to meet that fate. Let me meet imprisonment or Deathas the Lord will, but keep me from betraying my covenents, myfriends, my family and my God.  My spirit is stired when Ithink when I think of these things If John Sharp Ever hasthe privilege in the spirit world of meeting with Joseph BrighamThe Twelve and his many friends what will be his feeling, sorrowand Affliction. Well let us drop that curtain. Under these circ-umstances we hardly know what to look for in Men untillthey are tried.

They have stoped praying. Thy have lost the spirit of God.There Eyes are closed to the future. For no man with theHoly priesthood and the light of Christ within him, would takesuch a step.

 to form an acquaintance with theAllen family, especialy the old gentlemanbut I dont think he learnt much.But it is now reported that he isreturning to this place with othermarshals with papers for men, andsome think for L. A. and others, andin consequence I think it wisdomI think to take a place out of sightfor a season.  But bretheren it is notfor this purpose that I write to youIt is upon the situation of this Ashleyward that I wish to write.  I do notknow of a ward or stake in the wholeChurch that is more divided than thisAshley ward. It seems that the peoplewant an organization of this countyinto a stake, which I think they aughtto have.  But the great majority of thefaithful Saints think there is not a manin the ward that the people will uniteupon to preside over them. It appearsnescessary for a man to be sent framabroad of decission and firmness topreside over this stake if it everprospers as a branch of the Church ofLater Day Saints.  It is reported that AbramHatch the President af the Stake wantshis brother Jeremiah now bishop to be 
 $25,000 of other wealth, real estate, lends many houses in the city,and this is an ensample of many of the Islatus nation. They allowno white man or Mexiacan to mix with them in the blood; all theirmarriages are in their own tribe. Our friend (Reylocero) said theAmericans had called them wild men. If they were wild, they werehonest and virtuous. It was very seldom that a case of seduction ofa wife or daughter was ever known in their tribes. Whenever such acase did occur, the penalty of death was exedcuted and had been forcenturies, until civilization was introduced by Americans, who hadintroduced seduction and corruption wherever they had a chance, andnow, if a man was put to death for seduction, the civilization of theday would kill him. In fact, they were so much afraid of white mencoming kin contact with their women, that Brothers Tenney and RobertH. Smith, of the 15th Ward, Salt Lake City, three years ago, camenear starving to death before they got thoroughly acquainted withthem, as they were not willing for them to go into the presence oftheir women, but after the old patriarch had full confidence inBrother Tenney, he put his granddaughter (a very handsome young woman)in his charge, as he was going away for a season and a young Mexicanwished to court her, and the old gentleman did not wish him to marryher. And, as the people in that village had full confidence in him,on our arrival we were kindly received and entertained by all wecalled upon. I look upon the Islatus as the most industrious andhard laboring people of any I ever met with (tehe Latter-day Saintsnot excepted). This Nephite village has a field of corn ten milesin length and one in width, laying north and south fof their village,all irrigated, and the corn quite as good as any I ever saw in Utah,and perfectly clean; not a weed could be found in a hundred axcres. 
 by the Lord and his Holy Priesthood, and I shall certainlynot do it; for both earth and hell are full of that spiritalready, without any help from me, and I certainlydo not feel disposed to aid them in the matter.Now, brethren, I have expressed myself in plainness;but I trust in a proper spirit, upon this subject; Fta-king all these things into consideration. If youwill tell me what your will is concerning this sub-ject, I will endeavor to carry it out to the best of myability.Brother Thatcher's answer to your letter has beensubmitted to me to read, which I have done care-fully. I discover nothing in it but what I canendorse.I remain your brother in the Gospel,Wilford Woodruff

Presidents, bishops,and people seemed to engage in the undertaking withan earnest, zealous purpose, until another letter fromthe Presidency was received, which expressed a desirethat the subject should not be urged upon the brethrenas a missionary duty, but be presented as a vol-unteer service. This also was attended to with greatcaution, and the call was repeated in person and byletter to each of the presidents of the Stakes, and seve-ral of the priesthood meetings were attended, in allof which the views of the First Presidency were mostcarefully communicated.From that time it seemed as if the calllost its hold upon the minds of the people as aduty or obligation.

 Pres Geo. Please write him a good letter from thegeneral news in which we all join with our best respectshis letter did not reach us until after the conferencewas over. [ Joseph Fielding Smith ]Sept 9th 1885.President John Taylor and Geo. Q. Cannon,Dear Brethren,I understand from letters from Salt Lake City, that Mrs. A. S. B. Jennings,who is now in Salt Lake City, is applying for thePost Mastership of Salt Lake City. I have been requestedto recommend her to Hon. John T. Caine. I will saythat I have formed a very favorable acquaintancewith her at the Muddy and at St. George. I believeher to be a true friend to the Peoples Party in Utah.she has proved a friend to our people at the Muddy,and wherever she has dwelt among them, and I think it would prove a blessing to the majorityof the Citizens of Utah, if she could obtain theoffice. I believe she has the ability to manageand magnify the office, and she is indorsed bypoliticians as a staunch Democrat, which may beof some influence with them.Your Brother in the GospelW.

 They have also twenty-one vineyards bordering on their city and 1000vines to each vineyard, some of them 60 years of age, all kept per-fectly clean and loaded with the finest of fruit, and as heavy a cropas I ever saw in St. Geotrge, and the vines stand from two to four feetin height and, in the fall of the year, each vine has a mound ofearth formed around it, until it is covered out of sight. In the spring it is covered and the earth leveled. This is an immensework. They have also many apple, pear and peach orchards, all ripeas well as the grapes. Islatus is only occupied by the Nephitesthemselves. No Mexicans or white men. The houses generally aremade of adobie, dcement or concrete, and plastered, the outside wallsas white as snow, and the floors made of mortar or plaster, verysmooth and many of them very neatly carpeted, and we saw some ashandsome women and girls as could be found in America, with the ex-ception of color. There is one practice that exceeds any civilizedcity on the bglobe that I ever heard of; there is no man, woman orchild allowed to sweep a particle of dirt or dust from their floorsinto the door yards or streets, under the penalty of a fine. It allhas to be gathered in cloths or baskets and carried to mounds whichare located in different parts of the city. The room we occupiedwas in the center of the town and the mound formed from the sweepingsof the floors in that part of the town measured 150 yards at the baseand some thirty feet high, which had probably been 100 years in col-lecting, for they did not appear to cart it waway. I found in Is-latus and in other villages of the Nephites the same kind of crockeryand stone ware painted in all its brilliant colors that we find theremnants of in their ancient cities or ruins of the ancient inhab-itants. All of their water jugs and main crockery are of this mat-

WoodruffSept 17, 1886[end sideways text]Sept 9, 1886PresidentsJohn Taylor & George Q Cannon,Dear Brethren,your Letter of Aug 27. was received, and readwith much interest, yes Brethren I also feelit my Duty to acknowledge the hand of God inhis present dealng with us.  I am satisfiedthat He is permitting this present Raid upon theLatter Day Saints for a wise purpose. But it isall in fulfillment of the revelations of God throughthe Mouth of Ancient and modern prophets. OurNation is determined to get ripe in thir iniquityTheir never was a Nation ripening faster andthey must fulfill ther Destiny. The same wavethat Engulphed the Jaredites & Nephites will over-whelm this Nation or one Like it. They will make warupon the Saints untill their Cup is full. AgainZion has got to be cleansed The Saints have got to bepurified and united, and my opinion is we shall beaffflicted untill it is done. It is not for me to sayhow long it will take. It has seemed to meof Late that there was a wave of Evil passing over thwhole Church & Kingdom of God like a wave of the seato temp men to do Evil.  Men that have been strongfor years give way to Adultey & pollution, and sacrificesalvation to gratify the Lord of the flish, while these thingsremains Zion will be afflicted untill she is purifiedI have been pained to hear the reports of Eventspassing among us. But Zion will mo be moved2out of her place. God has Decreed it. He will^contend with Zion &^ plead with her strong ones untill she is purifedand overcomes and clean before the Lord.  The ZionChurch, and Kingdom of God must stand, prevail, conquer& overcome while the wicked must be destroyed, andBabylon fall.  The Lord will not fail concerning hispromises I am satisfied that great Judgments awaitour Nation, and afflictions begins at the House of God.I think it is vary signifficant that the firstEarthquake that has done Damage in North Americafor a century should begin at Charleston wherethe rebellion commenced See D&C. section 121. x 23. 24. 25 vThe word of the Lord should comfort us and sustain usin all our afflictions.  We are begining to pass throughsome strait places and making important History(We hear all kinds of reports of the Determination ofthe wicked concerning the presidency to take themEither Dead or alive  I cannot feel that thy will belater in Either Condition, they will not if the pryers ofthe saints prevail) But No doubt their is a greatExertion made by our Enemies to get possession ofthe Leaders of the Chuch But I am satisfied thatthe Lord will watch over them, and reveal unto themtheir Duty, and what Course to pursue in orderto be saved Joseph Smith has set us an exampleat the Head of this dispensation the same as Jesus at thehead of his both sealed their testimony with their Bloodand Lives.

So that we only know of five personswho have reported themselves ready to go to SanJuan settlement. They are from Sevier Stake, 
 5to the offices of the last election, andBro. Davis told me to day that thisJohnson has reported that F M LymanJohn Henry Smith both promised himthat if he would be baptizsed they wouldmake him president of this Stake. Ihave more confidence in these twomen than to believe any sutch reporthe is an enemy to this people, and Ibelieve would sell us all far a few dollarsa piece. The same Johnson has marriedBro. Davise's Daughter which I supposeis one cause of his being in favor ofhim I have received reports from bothparties, and I can see that the divisionis universahl and growing continualywider and more bitter. Every bishop inthe ward feels that bishop Hatch andcouncillor Davi's course in electing anoutsider and a bitter enemy is entirelywrong as I do myself. I told Bro. Davis Ithought very strange that he and bishopHatch should have united with theoutside element to elect a man outsideof the church and of his character fora selectman. It is said there is a petitionin circulation to the Presidency of the Churchto have bishop Hatch elected President of thisStake. But I do not think that he is a man

The same authority that gave themcounsel at that time to attend, has since giventhem and us all counsel to keep out of thehands of our enemies; and I feel satisfiedthat with the exposure to which they are subject that theycould not go through the country to Logan and returnwithout getting into trouble as all the railroadtrains and stations are guarded from here to Logan.Bro.

 erial, for they still hold the art of making and painting. We vis-ited quite a number of the fzamilies at the village and were kindlyentertained. Among others, we visited Mrs. Pascual Avieta, a Neph-ite lady, I should judge 50 years of age, a large portly woman, witha large, fine home; floors neatly carpeted, settees covered withNavajoe blankets, wiorth $15 each. She was neatly dressed. I wasintroduced to her by Brother Tenney and her daughters and sons. Shereceived me and treated me with all the elegance that any refinedlady could, and presided over her household with all the dignity andgrace of a Martha Washington. When her daughters were introducedto me, after bowing and shaking hands, they very reservedly andmodestly retired across the room, sat down upon a settee and listenedto what was said in silence. The matron sat down beside me and con-versed with great fereedom. While the family could speak good Span-ish, her son, a fine young man of 20, could speak good English, whichwas a God send to me, and I thoroughly improved it by preaching theGospel of Christ and blessings of the kingdom of God to him, whichhe gladly received and promised to deliver the same to his father andmother. The matron invited us into her pear, peach and apple or-chard and grape vineyard which were ripe, and we feasted to our sat-isfaction, and we repeated by invitation the same ceremony each daywhile in Islatus. The feast was on the 27th of August. There werehundreds of Mexicans from all the surrounding country gathered. TheMexican women and girls, with their long trails. Most all the drink-ing, gambling and figthting, which lastied all night, were done by theMexicans, while the Islatus were in their homes and doors locked atan early hour.

I have thoughtthat such Men as Lot & Jesse N Smithmight buy out some 2 or 3 Gentiles in theupper Muddy in Nevada which wouldcontroll all the watter of that settlement.They wanted to sell very much when I wasthere, so far all our people has had theprivilege of voting or holding officewithout any question to ther religionbut how long that order of things willlast I cannot say. It is said theMill of the Gods grind slow, but sureThe Mill of the Devils grinds by fist fastin these Mountains, but not always safeThey now have an Idea that they arenow going to destroy the Saints, butthey have one difficulty in ther way, andthat is the Lord, they may  indictconvict & fine him, but they cannotimprision him. Their is no doubtbut what He will pay them, but not inthe coin they wish for, for God holdsthe keys of power, Death, & Hell, and neitherthe ring nor our Government has anycontroll over him or his power. I don'tknow that I have any council to give thePresidency of the Church, without it is the council 
 a reliable source not to come up and expose him-self. The same party wished us to get word to you,not to give your enemies any chance; but I wassatisfied that you would be kept advised of allthings necessary for your protection.I wish it distinctly understood that I do not wish tointerefere with any counsel given by the Presidency ofthe Church, but in this case, I did not think you wouldapprove of it yourself and I have told them so; andthey are acting upon it and are going to stop; and ifthere is anything wrong about it, I wish to take the res-ponsibility upon myself and not them. I have actedupon the best judgment I possess in the matter. Theythemselves felt they were running great risks, especiallyMcA., but they wished to obey counsel.Brother David H Cannon thinks he can go in safety,and I think is calculating to go to represent the Stake.I do not know whether Erastus is calculating to goor not. I have enjoyed good health and spiritswith the exception, I am just getting over an attackof the Epizootic, or distemper of some kind that has been going through this Southern country, and which hasmeade me nearly sick for a week; but I am all right at pre-sent. I visited Bunkerville and the Muddy settlements andheld meetings with them and installed a Bishop at Overton on the Muddy. Our brethren are resettling thatcountry again. The land is very rich and abundanceof water. When our brethren were there before theyput out a good many cottonwood cuttings, whichnow make forests of timber over two feet through. I havenever seen timber grow so fast in any country.We are kept acquainted of the exertions made by our enemiesto entrap our leading men and their families, and they have theprayers of all Israel. I was made acquainted with your meetingwith the Apostles, which I heartily endourse and will hold to the compactThat the protection of the Almighty and the power and spirit ofGod may be with you and family and coucillors is the daily prayerof your brother in the GospelLewis Allen

And onSaturday night, at the Sheep-herd Springin the Mountains, some 40 miles fromSunset, I received a letter from BrotherTenney upon the subject; the follow-ing is an extract. ("On the eveningof the 14th I received your letter, andaccording to your request, I started forSt. John in pursuit of the object this morn-ing about 9 o'clock. I have signed myname to a bargain; thus buying theentire right of water, ditch, and land,(except 2 1/2 acres situated upon theeast side of the river, in the edge ofthe town:) Commencing at the bridge—(including the bridge)—and runningdown the River, for the sum of (750)— Seven hundred and fifty head of cows;I thought I would stay at the Spring untilthe 25th.

Direct Bro Tenneyto close this [illegible] and secure the Meadowswithout delay, for the enemy is on the alert."So I awoke awoke my messenger who broughtme the letter. We made our fire, got ourbreakfast and took our carriage and drove40 miles to Sunset, over a rough rockycountry a part of the way. We arrivedabout 7 o'clock. I counselled with LotSmith, and yesterday I wrote a letter toAmmon M. Tenney to go immediatelyand close this bargain, and secure the2 1/2 acres if possible. Buy out the whole placeif possible; so that the Jews or Gentiles shouldnot have a hold among them.

Ithink there is element sufficient for forty good, faithful Elders tobe employed to convert them to the Gospel of Christ and quite a goodnumber of missionaries called at the October Conference who can speakthe Spanish langyuage, or who will be able to learn it. I have al-ready sent Brother Taylor a small list of names, including the In-dian missionaries that are already in this country, as far as a I canremember them, and if there are any in St. George or soutthehern Utah,or northern, who can speak the Spanish, or who will learn it, I woudldlike Brother Taylor to have them by the October Conference.I am happy to be able to state that most of the settlers I havevisited of the Saints have been blessed with fair crops of grain,notwithstanding the dry season. They were just finishing threshingas I left Snowflake. They will have over 3000 bushels of grain,mostly wheat, and I am confiedent they will have over 4000 bushels ofWheat at Sunset.I have not written anything for publication concerning my journ-eying to Lamanites or Nephites of late, thinking it would not be wis-dom to publish anything about our labors among the American Indiansunder the present state of excitement on Mormonism.

 The History of Joseph Smith contains noaccount that we find of Orson Pratt's being cutoff from the Church by his Quorum. But inthe History of Brigham Young, in the "Millen-nial Star," vol. 26, page 151, is the account ofthe labors of the brethren of the Quorum with him,and of the ordination of Amasa Lyman in his stead, which is also quoted in the pamphleton Marriage and Succession, pages 19 and 20.In the "M. Star," Vol. 20, page 423, is givena full account of his baptism, confirmation, andrestoration to his former standing and apostleship,in which account the prophet Joseph says, "I toldthe Council that, as there was not a quorum pre-sent when Orson Pratt's case came up before them,he was still a member, that he had not been cutoff legally, and I would find some other place forAmasa Lyman, to which the Council agreed."This occurred on the 20th of Jan., 1843.Orson Hyde was sustained and publishedas President of the Twelve Apostles until and atthe April Conference, 1875.It was at the October Conference, 1875, that

I have 3 weeks to decideand^or^ notify them that I cannot accept.Thus giving you time to express to me.Now, you may think this a big price, andso it is, but just as sure as you loose thischance, or let it go a while longer, you willjust so sure have to pay 250 more cows;and it will continue to rise. What is the sum of 750 head of dows, when we are blessed withthe cattle upon a thousand hills, comparedto a home for two hundred large familiesand probably more? How ever it is in thehands of the Priesthood. They would take otherstock of purchasers at fair prices. If I hadthem I could turn out 40 yoke of oxen to-day,but probably not tomorrow.(Round Valley is a little east of South of St. John)It will be well to proceed immediately to takeup the Meadows; if no other way, send menfrom the settlements. I mean more than Isay; for it is very urgent, you may depend uponit. If it was me directing as you are I wouldnot let day-light nor dark make any differenceand while I speak of this, I will say that ifthere is any Mormons that could be sparedit would be well to send them immediately hereto take possession; as nine points in the Lawis to have peacable possession, for I tell youbefore-hand, that when this purchase is knownit will make one of the greatest excitementsthat ever was here, as it will break upmerchants and at least 100 families, whohave built, and are depending upon rent-ing from the Barths Brothers.My well in the new Meadow is 65 feetdeep to water, which is inexhaustable.I have expended $2000 there, and wasgoing to move my family there in twoweeks, but if you deem it wisdom forme to move here to St. John, without unloadingI will do so, as it will be wisdom for someone to be here.").Now Brother Taylor, all of the foregoing isfrom his letter, which will give you a littleinsight into the affair. I got his letter atabout 8 o'clock in the evening. I had beentraveling through the snow all day.

John TaylorDear Brother,I write to say a messenger has just arrivedfrom Colorado Meadows with a letter from BroTenney informing me that we have secured the purchaseof all of St Johns except one water claim and 2 1/2 acresof land. Our purchase secures to us 3 water ditchesall the land both sides of the river, and the town inc-luding the toll bridge. We got this purchase for 700Cows to be paid in one year, from two to six yearsold. We have also taken possession of the ColoradoMeadows, I think some 25 or 30 claims entered andwe are the first on record to secure the water of theLittle Colorado to water 4480 acres of the land of thisMeadow. We were none too soon in securing this meadowfor our claims to the water and the possession of theland had only just been obtained before theMexicans came to enter the water and secure and takepossession, and they were very much astonished to findand have the Bishop at Johnson get some teams to goto Upper Kanab and get the lumber that is sawed forthat boat and have it carried to the ferry or havethe boat made in the Settlements and carried downon wheels. It seems to be absolutely necessary thatsomething should be done. I cannot do anythingabout it while I am here, and again they want meto go to St Johns and the Meadows to assist aboutthe settling of the country there.I remain your Brother in the gospelA. H.

 take up claims, so as to secure the Meadowsbefore the inhabitants of St. John know anything about it. Our missionaries are now onthe way with my letter to Bro. Tenney.Now, Brother Taylor, what I wish to re-quest concerning this matter is this;That the companies who are being organizedto come to take possession of St. John and tolocate the Meadows will not delay, but comethis fall. And, again, you will see from Bro. Tenney's letter, that according to thecontract he is to pay 750 head of cowsfrom 2 to 6 years old. Now, we have got todepend a good deal upon the Brethrenwho come from Utah, to bring this kindof stock with them. So I wish you wouldinstruct Bros Rockwood and Vancott to seethat these companies are well supplied withsurplus cows—enough to pay for the purchaseof St. John. And, again, stock is the bestproperty for our emigration to bring to thiscountry, as stock, I  think is higher herethan in Utah.

We are coninually sending men outof our settlements to take and hold possession until wecan get the emmigration of our people to ^take^ possessionI understand there is a large emmigration of bothman and beast of our people on the road, and as fastas they arrive and have no appointed destination I amcounseling them to go to St Johns until we can get enough to take care of the place.I have been suffering for a few days with a severecold upon the lungs until it was leading to the Congestionof the lungs. My throat and lungs became so sore andraw that I could scarcely swallow or raise anythingand what I did raise was like fresh blood. I was usingdry sulphur and other things but appeared to do me nogood and as the matter was becoming somewhat seriousw^i^th one and while thinking of what I should do thethought came to me to try pulverized charcoal. I imme-diately had some prepared and I dropped near a teaspoon-ful of it dry into my throat, and soon drank a table-spoonful of it in some warm water and it relievedme immediately. it stopped the soreness and bleedingof throat and lungs and in 24 hours I was all rightagain except somewhat hoarse. The reason why I amparticular about making this statement is, I wouldrecommend a trial of the same in case of that fataldisease the Diphtheria.

I should like tobe informed, as soon as you receive this, whatthe prospect is about the companies, and what the chance will be about their bringingcows with them. We can begin to feel andsee the importance of the counsel and viewsof President Young, years ago concerning thiscountry, and he often said; "Bretheren, formyour settlements in Arizona ^and^ New Mexico,for the day will come, when you will want ahome there; and the time will come whenmany will be glad to find friends inArizona." That day has already come, andwe have got to occupy this country, andthere is plenty of room; and the sooner someemigrate ^from Utah^ the better. St. John is the hot-bedand Carthage of this county; and I feelit very important that we secure it.I do not know as I have any thing more tosay upon this subject, at present. I receivedword from Brother Brigham Young that hethought he would visit us in Arizona soon,with some other bretheren from the North. We shallbe glad to receive them; and all would be glad toreceive Bro Taylor, in this Country, if the journeywas not too long, and his business would per-mit; or any others of the councilIf Brother Brigham should want a day's huntto rest him, I could take him, in a day's drivewhere he could see antelope in flocks like sheepI saw 300 on Saturday in going 2 miles—a hundred in a flock.My Love to the CouncilYour Brother in the GospelW Woodruffper Lewis Allen 
 Sunset Apache Co ArizonaJanuary 13th 1880Prest. John TaylorDear BrotherIn company with Bro Lot Smith I left Sunseton the 24th of December, and attended the Quarterlyconference at Snow-Flake on the 27th and 28th and thenwent to our missionary camp on the Meadows and toSt. John to see the state of things, and to assist thebrethren about the settling of the St John purchaseand we found two difficulties in our path. Firstthe Mexicans had destroyed in their ignorance nearlyall of the Government Survey stakes and Boundaries(thinking that if the stakes were destroyed they would not haveto pay for the land). This made it quite difficult forthe brethren who had taken up claims on the Mead-ows to find any lines so as to tell where to build.And on our return to St Joseph I engaged Major Laddto go to the brethren at the Meadows and St Johnand try to run out the lines. And the other difficultyis the want of men to hold the claims at the Meadowsand take possession of the land we have purchasedat St John. We need 100 men ^at St John^ alone, while there isroom for 200. While at the same time our mission-

I havefelt for a few days like breaking out of my prison housesome here in St George. I met in council with E. Snowand the presidency of the St George stake, on friday night. Ifelt a desire to attend the quarterly conference and con[si]der-ded to do so, but as the U. S. Marshall Armstrong andClerk of the Commissioner at Beaver was expecting to attendconference on both days; I concluded not to go untillsunday. So I attended the Bishops Meeting in the morningat 9 oclock upon the subject of trying to collect meansfor the firnishing finishing of the Manti TempleAll the Bishops promised to do all thy could to acompli-sh it. At 10 oclock I went into the stand, and I dontknow that there would have been much more su^r^prise ifa man had risen from the Dead & gone there; for although I hadbeen 3 1/2 months in St George very few persons knew that I was inthe county, as I had ownly privately met with some of theprayer circles. In the Afternoon I had the privilege of speakingto a full house including the U. S. Officers. I did nothesitate to speak plainly and bear my testimony of ourmission to the world, and our responsibility to God andour fellow men in the proclamation of the gospel of JesusChrist, and when Nations and rulers passed laws against theLaws & Commandments of God it was better to obey God ratherthan man. I felt free in my spirit Brother Snow spoke in the forenoonAt the Close of the meeting I passed out by the Marshal who conversed

 aries at the meadows are holding from 3 to 4claims each. We have but few men at St John as yetI am turning in the emigration as far as I can thosethat I can get to go there but a good deal of theemigration have other places designated to go. I appoi-nted Bro. R. Allred to assist Bro Tenney in deliveringout the land to the emigration as they come. I alsoappointed or recommended Bro. Allred to take chargeof the meetings until the place gets settled so that itcan be more fully organized. Of course all that countrycomes under Bro Jesse N. Smiths jurisdiction in hisstake. I think Bro Nail of Toquerville will take uphis farm there but will have to get a Ranche outside for his large amount of stock as will all men withlarge herds, as it is not suitable for large herds to dwellin any settlement of this country, for there is good facil-ities throughout the country outside of farming districtWe cannot tell what amount of land there is in thepurhcase at St John, it may amount to 2000 acresit may vary from $5, 6 to 7 an acre besides theGovernment title it may not go above $5.One Mexican Brother joins us on our lower line whichhe throws into the company and takes his share of landand water with the rest. We also bought out two Mex-ican claims joining our Mexican Brothers claimdown the river with two houses, 320 acres of land for9 cows, so we have an unbroken claim from the Damdown the river on both sides nearly to the Meadowswith the exception of two Mexican claims below usand when we left one or both of theirm were talking ofbeing baptized, but there is one thing I wish to nameconcerning our purchase. I supposed it includedthe houses of the Mexicans. I now understand itincludes the land they stand on but the Mexicansclaim the houses. The Jews permitted them to buildon the land and they now claim them, but they arepoor, low, one story mud houses mostly. We haveseveral of the houses standing on the farming landThe two brother missionaries from Ogden occupytwo of them with their famiflies.
