 bed. My lungs became so tightned  I could scarcely breath while lying  down. I coughed a great deal  with hard labor, I employed  no doctor, but the brethren  administered to me daily, and   the sisters nursed me.    On  satuarday 12th finding that nothing  I took seaemed to loosen the tightness  on my lungs, I had recourse  to a Lobelia Emetic, which  brought a great deal of flegm  from my system, but still did  not seem to reach the foundiation  of the descease, my cough was  very painful, and hard work  to talk, and very difficult breath-  ing while lying down.    Yesterday 13th I sent for Brother  Empy and he brought his steam  box and set it up in the  house, and I took a Vapor  Bath towards evening, which 
 is good.    The weather, both day and night  is cooler.    With continued desire and  prayers for your preservation  in health and usefulness to  Israel    we remain    your brethren in the Gospel    Wildford Woodruff    John D. T. McAllister. 
 A large congregation, good order, And attention. this is the last time I have seen Elder  Hyde: He went to Washington, to transact some business, And I took steem boat with my family  to go East via Lakes. I will here name that while we were Journeying by land we all enjoyed  good health And our youngest child which had been vary feeble in health from her birth improv  much while on land but as soon as we took water began to run down. And we had to depend  upon milk we could get on our road for her living, And we co[u]ld not get it while on the   Illinois River for several days. she ceased to eat any thing, fevar set in and bowel complaint  And when we Arived At Perue the termination of the canal she was vary low. we went  12 miles into the country At my Brother in Laws, capt Lther Scammans, who married my wife  sister, And on the second day after our Arival at his house our child Shuah C. Woodruff Died  on the 22nd July Aged 9 month. we buried her in Capt Scammans garden And put A stone at  her grave with her name Age &c Engraved upon it. we both felt this to be a great sacrifice  As we have the loss of our other children. After spending A few days here we continued our  journey (Accompanied by our worthy Brother Dominicas Cartar) via Chicago, Buffalo, Albany,  And Arived in Boston on the 12 October. The 2nd night After I left Albany, one quarter  and the most business part of that city was laid in Ashes: damage Estimated at five  millions dollars; [FIGURE] many of their houses were truly left unto them desolate" Soon after  my arival in Boston, my Wife & children went to Maine, & spent their time with their  friends untill the setting in of winter. Since that time they have spent their time in  Cambridge port, Mass. as it was nearer the centre of my labours, And I could occasionally  spend A little time At home. I have however spent the greatest part of my time travelling  since I arived in this country, visiting the Branches, parts of Branches, scattered saints &c  organizing whare it needed it, leaving or sending the Epistle of Dec 23rd 1847 to those who had it  not, Endeavord to impress upon the minds of all the Saints the importance of puting into practice  the council And teaching contained in the Epistle, Urged the immediate gathering of the Saints  if they could get no further than St Louis, thinking that if they could once get started out of  their bed for the west, they would some day get to the valley. I have found the Saints in these  Eastern lands though few in Number, scattered over A wide Extent of country.  since I arived  I have visited Philadelphia, New Jersey, New York, Long Island, Norwark, North Haven, New Havan,  Fair Havan, Ct.  New Bedford, Fall River, Lowell, Salem, Bradford, Northbridge, Mass. Peterboro,  Guilsom, Walpole Athans, N. H.  Saco, portland, Milton, Farmington, Maine, And A numbe  of other places whare some saints reside. I have visitded most of the saints in the Eastern States  with the Exception of those at New Brunswich, Canidas, And some in vermont. while in Maine  late in November I went to Portland, to get Passage to St Johns, to visit St Johns, Miramich  Halafax, & other Parts of New Brunswick, Canida &c: But Steemers had stoped running, And I  could ownly get passage from Boston, on board of th Liverpool Packets that touch at Halaf  And As it was cold weather And difficult travelling in the winter, in that country  I concluded to omit it untill the opening of Spring, when I am Expecting to make a  tour through that region of country. In my travels among the churches in the Easter  States I have found them in many instances in a scattered & unorganized condition

 I think there will be a number ofyet added to that branch of the  Church. I feel thankful that I have the privilege of  gathering a few grapes after the vintage has done, while  in New York on Sunday & Monday last I had an interview  with a gentleman by the Name of Joseph Smith was intro-  duced to him by Br Holister. He is a smart intelligent  business man, is believing our doctrine & wishes to go  to the valley & spend his days with the Saints, for He sees a  storm coming, & knows of no other place of reffuge that  He can get to but Zion, And this feeling is stealing owr  some, & suddenly siezeing others of that part of mankind who reflect  & begin to deeply feel this Eternal truth which is now revealing  it self before their Eyes that their is sumthing awful about  to burst upon the world which the Nations cannot Esscape &  they feel they need some place in the Chambers of the rokcks to  hide up in order to escape some terrible blow, & they can find  No place suitable for the occasions ownly with the Mormons  in the valley of the Mountains. My whole soul is on fire often  when I reflect upon the state of Great Babylonn, & behold the saints which  are appraching the Earth, & view the contrast of the scenes to be   Enacted in Zion & Gog, Jerrusalem & Egypt. The world is like  a drunken man staggering reeling & falling into an abiss while the  Saints ^Elders^ who isare faithful before God, begin to feel ligke the  Angels who siezd Lot by his garment to hasten him out  of Sodom; I want the prayers of my brethren that I may  be sustained & have the power of God rest upon me daily  that I may be enabled to cry aloud & spare not while I  am in the midst of Babylon. I do not want the Blood  of any man to be found in my skirts, Notwithstanding  I am in a portion of the vineyard whare I am surrouded with but few  Saints & travelling almost daily in the midst of masses of men  whose bands of wickedness are so strong that no man can break  them & are ripe for the damnation of Hell, yet I have never  felt on any mission before such a wait of Responsibility resting  upon me as of late. when I reflect upon my calling as an Apostle  of Jesus Christ, A shepherd to the flock, A minister of the Gospel 
 The Saints at Mount Trumbull have been  organized as a Branch with Elder Eli Whipple  as Presiding Elder, and have been attached  to the 1st Ward St George.    There are now 31 men women and children  at Trumbull organized in the United  Order and attached to the United Order  of St George. Eli Whipple is the Super-  intendent. This census does not include  Bro. Green and his hands. An excellent  spirit prevails in the little organization at  Trumbull; Bros Nixon and Bleak visited  them for the purpose of organizing them and  laid before them some of the instructions  which you had written to other organiza-  tions of the United Order.    The Brethren at Trumbull have unan-  imously prescribed the uniform rate of  wages of One dollar and a quarter for each  man per day and women's youth's and  boys wages to be in proportion. The  Saints in the organization there are living  on the one eating house principle.    We close this letter on Sunday afternoon. 
 seemed to help me. For the first  time since I have been sick, I  was enabled to lyie in bed through  the night untill 5 o'clock A.M.  and breathed somewhat free, and  without much coughing. Brother  George Jarvis watched with me.  I took another Steam Bath  this morning and feel better  today.    My lungs are   still very much oppressed and  I have violent spells of cough-  ing but I feel there is a   change for the better. I am  well nursed and taken care of,  and I think in a few days, will  be able to get around.    Brother Bently has been very sick  with the same disease, but he is  better and called upon me to-  day.    I named in one  telegram that we would like  5 1/4 yds linen to make the middle 
 Please read the remainder of this communication to thyself  President Young. I consider that a sense of duty required  me to lay before you certain things which have been a source of  much grief and sorrow to me since my arrival in England. Some  of the reasons why I have not before opened my mind to you upon  the subject have been: that I have not wished to trouble your mind  with any thing that I could get along without; and it has been much  against my will to find fault with my bretheren; and lastly I have  lived in hopes of arranging all matters in an amicable manner without  calling your attention to the subject at all. But I have at last, come  to the conclusion that you ought to know all; you will then understand  my position and know how to to remember me before the Lord  and perhaps you may be somewhat surprized at what I am about  to reveal to you. At the Death of Joseph, you are well aware, there  was a struggle for power among certain men in America. And you ^You have^  felt the weight of this Truth in Zion & so have I in Liverpool, [far]  among men from whom I looked for better things viz: R. Hedlock and  T. Ward.    There has been one evil in this church from the beginning.  Give men a little extra power and influence for a season. when it is  called for they are not willing to give it up or fill their own place  and susttain men in their's. At last, I have found it so here.  I will now give you a statement of facts as near as I can in  truth since my arrival in Liverpool.    When I first landed I dis-  covered a coldness and distance on the part of Elder Hedlock to-  wards me, but much more so towards Brother Clark. After spending  a few days in getting settled I began to make inquiry into the affairs  of the office. Brother Hedlock said the account books were there I could  examine them. The books not being kept in a systimatical order  I could not readily comprehend things. I soon saw every exertion was  made to prejudice my mind against Brother Clark. The Spirit against  him was of such a nature that I saw he could never work with  Brother Hedlock. In fact the accusations against him were of such  a nature and urged so warmly I was obliged to make it almost my  first business to trace up the accusations against him to the fountain  head through all it's windings. It appeared to me to be like great  groanings among the mountains to bringforth a mouse. it ended  in this fact: he had kissed somebody. In my opinion it was more  to keep him out of the Emigration business than to clear the church of  crime. After I settled this up I advised him to take charge of  some conference for a season until there was a better feeling at Liverpool.    I made my address to the churches through the Star and had my  recommendation published with it that the Saints might know that  I came with authority from the proper source.    I saw that Brothers  Hedlock and Ward seemed to be much troubled about their standing  so I made choice of them for councillors out of respect to the men  and their former standing, thinking they would operate with me. There  was nothing in the Star but that all was right. but the more I advanced  towards my place as President to take charge of affairs and direct  them, the more I found a spirit against it and secretiveness in all  things especially with Bro. Hedlock; and Brother Ward had so much  of John Bull in him, it seemed at times that it was of more consequence  to him than the Priesthood. And as out of the heart the mouth speaketh  I soon saw things in their hearts not right if I could judge from the  course they were pursuing. their feelings were "We have power & influence  and we will hold it." Brother Hedlock continues to carry on business  his own way without consulting me in scarcely anything unless I dragged  it out of him, and knowing it was my place and duty to understand  what was going on I inquired into matters until in several instances  he insulted me in the office and manifested much anger in the midst  of considerable company, and as I would not quarrel with him, at  least, in company, I quit the room. when he got mad he would say  how much the Twelve were laying up from his labours and he ought  to have his share of it as well as they. In several instances he threatened  of leaving the office and going home at once. As he had threatened it so much  I finally told him, I did not care how quick he went. "Yes" then says  he "I know that is what you want, to get rid of me and get Brother Clark  and you will do well enough." There has been so much of this spirit  that there has been no union. I have been a speckled bird and stranger  among them until it has caused me tears and sorrow by day and  night. I have grown old under it. We have never bowed our knees together  in prayer, but once, since we met, unless it has been in a conference.  If men are not agreed how can they walk together. Had they have been  an Enemy I could have met them but they were my counsellors, in  one sense tried friends; men from whom I expected better things. Men  that ought to have known my place and given it ^to^ me and helped me 
 16 miles East of BWebber River Oct 5th 1850    President Young    Dear Sir    We send unto you  our Brethren Miner Atwood & Wm Branch with a  request to you that you will use your influence  to assist those Brethren to obtain some oxen to assist  us the last 30 miles or so to get into the Valley we cannot  cross those two last Ridges without some assistance Our  teams Have failed us much faster since we left  Bridger than Before. our oxen & cows are daily failing  & dying in the yoke as it were. we Have 25 waggons in our Division  we are the Last company except Brother Hunters we stand in Need  of a yoke of oxen to each waggon if we can get them but if  we can get half that Number it will be a great Help to us  Elder L. Hardy with 250 waggons is a few miles ahead of us they  are also weak in teams whether they will be able to get in  without Help I do not know.    We are all in good Health Elder Hyde & company  passed us to but did not stop ownly to say How do you do  all were well. If the Brethren come with any oxen I would  like them to bring one waggon & a bushel of potateoes.    WYours  Yours Truly    W. Woodruff 
 Upper crossing of the Platt Sept 3rd 1850    President Young    Dear Sir    We received a visit a few days since   from Brothers Stratton & Hanks As messengers from the   valley Their visit Has truly cheered our hearts & not ours  ownly but the Hearts of all the moveing camps of Israel who   are wending their way through these mountains to their desired   Home. It Has caused our souls to rejoice not ownly in the   interest the presidency of the Church manifest for our welfare   but also of the Glad tidings & good report they bring of the universal  prosperity & Blessings of God upon the Saints in the valleys of   the Mountains. I wish to say a few words concerning my present   condition & circumstances & the company with me I received   your letter of instructions while in the east concerning the gathering   of the Saints from the Eastern Lands. I laboured with all   disligence to carry out the instructions given me. It was a  Barren field & like the gleaning of grapes after the vintage was  done yet in my gleanings we Baptized about 800 & gathered   about 500 for the vally & the remainder who are in the faith   will leave the east for the valley next Spring. I started from   Boston the 9th April with 209 of the Saints the Philadelphia company   started a week before in consequence of freight Baggage &c we   Had to take slow tra[i]ns or Emigrant trains which made it somewhe  somewhat late in ariving at Kanesville. I sent two men early   in the season to St Louis with what means we could raise   to procure teams for our journey but Nothing ^was^ bought untill   my arival the great flood of gold emigration Had drained   the country of cattle & most of the emigrating Saints had   also bought before we purchased & it seemed almost imposs-  ible to obtain teams at all, & we had to purchase mostly  wild unbroke steers or old oxen, However through the Blessing   of God we were enabled to organize a company of over sixty   waggons & crossed the Mo River the 16th June the majority of which   were our Eastern Brethrn, but many Had to stop that expected to   come in consequence of the High price of oxen & the count of   Measures. We first organized our company into two divisions 
 W. Woodruff  May 14, 1877    vail.    In connection with  Brother Bleak some ten days since,  we wrote you a letter giving an  account of our Temple labor  during the whole month of  April, which we expected  would be taken to you by Brother  Bently, but he having been  confined with sickness, Brother  Bleak still holds it, the letter  also contains an account of  business in general, questions  asked, etc. I am inclined to  think we had better send it to  you by Wells & Fargo. Your family  are generally well. Alma & Susie have  started for the city.    We are  always glad to hear from you. That  health and peace & the blessings of God may  ever attend you is the earnest prayer of    Your Brother in the Gospel, W. Woodruff. 
 of Salvation to a Nation & Generations over whose head I behold  the drawn sword of an angry God suspended, which is about  to fall And fill all Idomie with death, I feel to cry out  Lord who is sufficient for these things, yet I feel thankful  to my Heavenly Father that He has granted unto me a  portion of his Holy spirit & Enabled me thus far on  this jouney & Mission to bear a true & faithful  testimony to the rightous & wicked as far as I  have had an opprtunity, and to keep myseflf unspotted  from the world. I had rather have favor with God  Angels & the martered Saints, & my Brethern in the valley  than to have all the Thrones and glories of the world combined  in my possession, for they look to me at the present time  like poor worthless rotten things ready to fall down  There is nothing appears valuable to me but Mormonism  for that Embraces all the substance & truth of Heaven &  Earth, and I hate to leave off thinking, talking or writing about  it, Still the things which move around us will attract our  Notice for a moment, some have mattracted my attention for  a few days past a little as I have been travelling, one or two of  which I will mention. Wm Smith is figuring in these Eastern  States of late to try to do sumthing but He cannnot acomplish  it. G. J. Adams has again turned to what He calls righteousness  joined the Temperanc Society & trying to raise up a Kingdom  in Baltimore, & while on his way to [Vorel] to attend a conference  called into my meeting on Sunday at New York the first  time I have seen him since I came East. I paid no  attention to him No more than if He had not been there  He sat untill meeting was about closed & went quietly away  without saying a word to anyone. I McGee Van Dusen has  stood in the streets of New York for nearly the whole past  past year crying aloud & selling his Pamphlets containing  his startling Disclosures of the Great Mormonc Conspiracy against  the liberties of the country Being their celebrated Endowments &c  (A copy of which I will forward to Brother Brigham with this, so you  can see how the Devil progresses in the East) 
 West Jordan, June 26, 1886    Emeline Woodruff    My dear Daughter I received your letter of the 22. And I received one before that,  I had not answered. The reason I had not written before is I have been at work getting   up a synopsis of all my journals for 51 years, that I could record in my Last journal   so I could lay them away, then I have to write from 2 to 8 letters a day myself on Church  business. It is not because I have forgotten you or the family. I would like to come   and visit you and the family if I could in safety but our enemies are so diligent after me   and my Quorum that I have to withdraw from all of my family and entirely hide up in   the County. And I expect I shall soon have to leave this county or go into the hands of  my enemies. My health is pretty good and my [blank] are good as far as the times will allow.  This whole nation is persecuting us under the form of law. They will both mob and rob   us as far as the Lord will let them. The Nation would not persecute us if we were not   the true Church of Christ. It stands us all in hand to be true and faithful to our God,  to our religion, and to our covenants. Give my Love to your Mother and to Marion,  Ensign, John and Julia. I hope Ensign will attend school steady what time he has to go  and improve his time and learn all he can for he will stand in need of it. He ought not   to stay out of school for sleigh riding or anything else but he should attend steady so as  to get all the benefit he can from it. Any letters for me left with Brother Juques at   the office. He will send to me. I remain your Affectionate Father    W Woodruff    Private to yourself and Mother    Emeline    I have felt a good deal of anxiety about your Marriage with David Burrows. I have   been afraid you would throw yourself away. You are a good girl, a good Latter Day Saint  and you are worthy of a good industrious, worthy man and a good Latter Day Saint. It  looks as though he got baptized and attends meetings to get a wife. I don't want you to   take a step that you will regret afterwards. I want you to study well this matter and not   take a step that will cause you sorrow. Now Sylvia Woodruff has flung herself away by  marrying Heber Thompson. He cannot provide her a home, food or raiment and she is   in poverty and affliction. I do not know what condition Br. Burrows is in to give you a  home and make you comfortable, you should look into this before you marry. It is a   very important step to take in life. Your husband should be temperate, industrious and   moral and not addicted to any bad practices. Many has inherited sorrow by marriage,  still marriage is honorable and it is right for girls to marry but they want to know who  they are getting. I am anxious to have you do well.    Your affectionate Father    W. Woodruff    Emeline I want to give you a little advice about signing your name. It is not proper for  any young lady to put Miss before her name. But whoever addresses you should write   Miss before your name. But the person writing should not put it to their own name.   You should write Emeline Woodruff and not Miss Emeline Woodruff. But it is proper   for anyone addressing you to write Miss Emeline. Try to remember this. WW 
 To day we are thankful in being able to  state that Sister Mary Bigelow is considerably  better. we are in hopes she will continue  to improve.    At this afternoon's meeting we read your  telegram of the 1st. The Saints shared in  our joy at receiving your encouraging words  and your blessing. May you long be spared  to encourage and bless Israel.    The weather here has now settled  down so as to be quite warm in the  middle of the day; though early morn-  ing and evenings are yet refreshing    We have all the Pulpit coverings,  and the rolls of Carpet well sacked up in  heavy domestic and Camphor gum applied  and enclosed according to instructions.    Most of the Doeskin suits have been made  and are being worn, the remainder will soon be  ready. All Temple Enclosure Gates hung and locked up. Night  Guard on Temple outside and inside.

 to fill it instead of placing me in a situation where I must war  for it and gain every inch of ground as at the point of a bayonet.    In speaking of the Emigration, Elder Hedlock has said it was  a very bad plan to change names and whenever he did leave he  could make me an agent to transact business in his name, as his  name was now so universally known, he has taken no pains to  acquaint me with the business or introduce me to any of the captains  but generally if any come to do business, he would sooner walk  away from me than acquaint me with what he was doing. We have  rented a new respectable office for three years. he has rented it  in his own name, he is also selling a part of it in his own name.  In fact he does all business in his own name without any regard  to me whatever as touching Emigration & Renting rooms, and one would  think from his actions that he was laying a foundation to spend  generations to come upon his own look in Liverpool. He has been  to much expense this season in publishing large handbills and  cards in his own name and scattered them all over the kingdom  as a general shipping agent without consulting me at all upon  these things. He is so secret in his movements and singular in his  habits that neither myself nor any man about the office knows  where he lives or boards, neither can I find out, though I have asked  him several times. He counts it an insult to be asked the question  He has kept the Temple Books until lately and signed all the re-  ceipts in his own name. he has manifested a spirit to gain all  the influence possisble. I had a plain talk with Elder Ward  a short time since upon the subject, (as I had heard much testimony  from others what they had said behind my back) I told Brother Ward  I knew my place and my counsellors ought to know it also.  I informed him they could not grease, soap or swallow me. that if  they undertook to ride me they would find a hard seat before they  got through. I told him that Brigham Young and not Reuben Hedlock  was President of the church, and if Hedlock had power and influence  the Presidency of the Church had given it to him, and if he were  in the way of his duty he would throw that influence into the  channel where it ought to be, for the stream had run out of  the channel long enough. I told him it was time for me to have  License for Emigration and for my name to appear upon the door  post and sign boards, hand-bills and cards as well as R.   Hedlock's. Elder Hedlock had found fault because I had  interfered with the Temple Books, but I have gone forward and  taken them into my own possession and the Temple money also.    I gave Brother Ward to understand that I wanted my name  to go as publisher of the Star, so it has found a place there; since  I took a decided stand upon the subject they have yielded in a   degree, but I do not at the present time know the income and  outgo of the emigration. Hedlock attends to that, keeps his own books  he does not consult me upon the subject. if he converses on the  subject it is to some one besides me. When I have conversed  with him upon the subject, he has said when the debts he had  contracted were paid he would give it up. He has also the Music  Hall rented in his own name. I do not think myself that Bros  Hedlock is a suitable person to conduct the Emigration here. I  think he has charge of it as long as is for our good. I think he  does not manifest the economy at all times that our circumstances  require. There has been much said at times about how much  he has paid out of his own pocket in carrying on business here,  but he had nothing when he came, and all his generosity, freedom  and expense have been at the expense of the office. They made  a collection among all the churches a short time before I came,  to pay the the debt for emigrating the poor, which they divided between  them. I do not know what it amounted to, perhaps £50 or so.  but I gave much offence because I inquired into it. In the  midst of all this there are times when Brother Hedlock manifests  a desire by words to do what good he can and help to roll on  the work but he has a very strange way of showing it since I  have been here. My arrival here was far from being welcome by  those who were in the office at Liverpool. I was informed, Elder  Hedlock said when he heard I was coming that I was a very tight  pernicious, close man. Thomas Wilson, a man with them in the office  said, if that were the case, I was not needed in England. There has  been a spirit manifested here that they were afraid they would  not get pay enough for what they did. Taking all these things into con-  sideration I do not think things will go right until Brother Hedlock  is called home, and transfers the business ^over^ into my hands. I shall then  know what shape it is in, but if the way he is doing business so  much out of sight was to be continued in the same way for five  years, I would be as much in the dark about it at the end as I am  now. I think if you should counsel him to come home and transfer  all matters into my hands, that he would begin to think something  about it. I do not wish you to let them know that I have made  a communication of this kind to you for I think the easiest way  to get along is for him to be counselled to come home. I have  been in a trying place. he held the License for Emigration—the office  and every thing in his own hands and name, and to undertake  to fill my place by force, it appeared like making an explosion in the 
 without holding any meetings, or manifesting any interest in the work, for an example    I went to New Bedford whare they have upon their church Books about 100 members   I gave out an appointment but did not get a dozen together, And in the organiz-  ation 25 names out of the 100 was given that might still be considerd as members  of the Church. Long Island was somthing similar to New Bedford. Also Salem, & other  places, I might name. I can say however that I found the Majority of the  branches organized, Holding meetings, And in some instances in better condition  than I expected to find them considering the many isms that have been afloat And the  little attention which the church has been Enabled to bestow upon them during their  pilgraimage in the wilderness. (Philadelphia is in good condition. I had good meetings  while there it is much the largest branch in the East the Number given me was 200  yet I do not think much more than one half that number Attend at any one time  ie of Members of the church. I found New York without A presiding Elder I called   them to gather And Appointed Thomas Cartwright of Liverpool their presiding  Elder. And since that they have been in better order than they have been before  for several years according to their Numbers, which they gave as 65. I have kept  A regular list of the number of each branch of the Church in the Eastern states as far  as I could obtain it, Either by visit, letters, or the report of others; And the following  is the result, which I think is correct in the Main and Embraces nearly all through-  out the field of my labours, the greatest part of which I have visited. This representa-  tion of 807 includes evry thing professing to have a  connexion with the church. Saints, Mormons, Hickory   Mormoms Hot, warm, & cold, &c &c. I have endeavoured  As far As I could to Ascertain by inquiring into their circu-  mstances their Ability to immediately gather to the west  And by judging from the report given me that many  if not the majority of those who are in the faith had not  means in hand to pay their fare to St Louis but my cou-  ncil has been generly to them to shape their business  so as to leave for the west as soon as they could pay  their fare to that place for I feel as though the call  of 16 years for the saints in the East to gather to the  west is long Enough for them to act upon it. For if  Father Holmes & many other Able men had gone to the  west 16 years ago, they might now be seen in your midst  in the valley of the Mountains of Israel filled ^with^ the spirit  and blessings of Zion, insstead of being in the East  pineing away & dying.

 President Brigham Young   Great Salt Lake City  Deserett    [upside-down text]  Octr 5, 1850    W. Woodruff  to  B. Young    for oxen to assist him  in to the valley    S. J  [end of upside-down text] 
 Robert C Petty was Appointed Capt of Hundred. Leonard Hardy  Captain of first fifty Edson Whipple captain of 2nd 50.  At Ash Hollow two of my waggon wheels were broke to peaces   which had to be filled with new spokes besides may tyre set  I did not think it wisdom for the whole company to wait   for the work to be done so by Advise some of both Divisions stoped   with me to assist me which formed a third Division of our company   the 1st Division with Captains Petty & Hardy went on. Also the 2nd Division   under captain Morfet. Captain Whipple stoped with with me   we Now form the 3rd Division of our company containing   26 waggons 12 of which are my own or under my immediate care   & responsibility. we are in the rear of the other Divisions.    The first Night after leaving the La Bonte we lost 75 Head of   oxen which strayed from the [ground] in the Night which   Detained us 4 days were all found but 4 Heads I purchased  66 Head of oxen & 30 cows for 12 waggons each carrying about   20 Hundred I have lost but 4 Head out of that Number  as yet 2 died &  2 strayed But the fore part of our journey  was not muddy roads which was Hard upon our whole  steers their Necks were badly galled & quite a Number are   Now breaking down Neck & foot sore, & failing, & we are  Now finding but little feed, but I spare No pains to   search for feed whare their is any prospect of finding it  I am endeavoring to travel every day as far as cercumstances   & the strength of our cattle will permit. I think the 1st & 2nd  Division of our company with common prosperity & the Blessings of God  will mostly be able to reach the valley with the oxen they Have   But Brother Strattan will be able to judge of it as He prefers  Now as His return those of us who are in the rear are the   worst off. I think according to present appearances that myself   & the company with me will not be able to reach the valley   with ^all^ our waggons except we could get the assistance of some   12 or 15 yoke of oxen & we should be vary thankful if any   of our friends in the valley could meet us with that amount  of team in the mean time we shall do our best to progress  as fast as possible the first & second Divisions of our company 
 But these things have no Effect or influence against us in the  minds of any whose respect is worth having, but the public  look upon them generally as a tissue of lies as they are, get  up to suit the specutlating times to gull the public & get money  Notwithstanding this & Miss Lewis Book are circulated  through the country. I can travel from Philadelphia  to Halafax through every town & city preach & visit whae  I please unmolested, unbisturbed ^& undisturbed^, & are becoming quite respet ^respect-^  able, (Perhaps you will say it is no credit to me, And I do not think much of the credit of  the world myself) However Mormonism is beginning to be somewhat resptabe  respectable since it is reported they have found gold, Another  thing is beginning to have a far more waity influence &  feeling of respet & Even fear in the minds of thousands  ie Thousands of the world are beginning to believe, & our Enemies  fear that although Earth & Hell combine to pour out  all their strength of unhallowed persecution upon the  Latter Day Saints, that Mormonism will not die, but  will live & breath & grow the more oppresssed ^oppressed^ untill ist  is destined to performed some mighty deeds, & that  the Mormon Zion will yet stand & flourish while those  who have sought its death, will be deprived of their own  power strength & greatness. bBut this being the case it  does not excuse the conduct of that class of men I have  been nameing & those associated with them who are seeking  our destruction. They were once with us, professing to build  up the Kingdom, of God. What are they now a set of poor  mean miserable Devils As mean & miserable as the Devil can make then  them, And If Brother Brigham & the rest of my Brethren will bear  with me a moment & let me esxpress my feelings to you upon that  subject a moment I will lay it before you in writing for I  may as well write it as think it. it is this, I say in the  Name of the Lord God of Israel that they shall be cursed from  this time forth & shall not prosper, & to the full force of the 
 Mr. Phippen    Sir believing you to be familliar with the word  of God & considering you willing to instruct your inferiors uppon  spiritual subjects, & after forming such conections of your character  I take this method to ask ^you^ several questions for information &  instruction as I have no other motive in view, & should you   not consider it beneath your notice to answer my questions  by writing but give me your opinions as you have formed it  from the word of God it would be highly intresing to me    the 1st is respecting the gifts that were in the ancient church the gift of  healing the sick raising the dead casting out devils &c.    2nd the sabbath & its changes.    3rd & last is the subject of babtism.    Firstly, while perusing  the sacred volumn of inspiration I find many wonderful works  were performed by our Saveiour, and likewise by the apostles though not  by their own power, but by faith in & through Jesus Christ  & if I mistake not when Christ first sent his disciples to preach  the gospel which was to the lost sheep of the house of isreal he commanded  them to heal the sick cleans the lepers rase the dead cast out devils &c.  ##Matthew 10|S. Mathew chap. X.## again in the last chapter of ##Mark 16|S. Mark## Christ appeared to   the brethren as they sat at meat & gave them a vary forcible command  to go into all the world & preach the gospel to ev^e^ry creature he that   believeth & is baptized shall be saved & he that believeth not shall  be damned & these signs shall follow them that believe in my name  shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues  they shall lay hands on the sick & they shall recover, &c this apparently  was the last command given by our Saviour before he assended to  heaven. now the question that arises in my mind is when & whare  were those gifts done away as some maintain that they are. I find  no scriptures satisfactory to prove that they ever were done away  theirfore I am led to believe that God is the same to day as in ancient  days & likewise should people at this day like as did the apostles & exercise  the faith that did Abraham in offering up his son Isaac that those gifts  might again be on the earth and in case of sickness we might   loock to the Lord for deliverance in prefference of trusting to an arm of   flesh. we read of a fwoman that was ill that had suffered many things  of many physicians & had spent all that she had & was nothing better but  rather grew worse which was finally healed by her faith in Christ.  should light be held up to the world uppon this subject at the preasent   day undouptedly their would be as little heed given to it as the Lord  told Ezekial their would be to his prophecy when he sent him to the house  of israel, yet I ask your opinion uppon the subject for information    (the Lord sent Ezekiel to prophecy nowithstanding they would not hear   & ought not light uppon this subject be held up even if it is not received) 
 [Beginning halfway down the page]    A copy of a Letter sent to Mrs Horner Oct 30, 1853    Great Salt Lake City Oct 30, 1853    Mrs Hornor    I take the Liberty of addressing a few lines to  you & of asking a few qustions which you will do me a great  favor by Answering the Next Mail so that I may get some  information upon a subject in which I am much interested  I sent by Brother Horner one year ago this fall $1552.40  in United States Gold to be forwarded on his arrival in the  States to Sanbon & Carter of  Portland Maine they have  Never received any of that Money nor heard any thing from  it on from Brother Horner up to the 5th Sept which  Letter I got this Mail. Now I wish to ask if you  know any thing about this Has Brother Horner Left that  amount of Money with you to be forwarded to the Above  men or to any body on My Account or Has Mr Middleton or 
 many of those who have means are prepareing to leave in the spring. Brother Haven  is expecting to lead up a company from Boston At the opening of navigation. Since I  have been on my Eastern Mission, while meeting with the saints, And teaching them the  first Principles of the gospel, the Epistle of the Twelve, their gathering & building up  Zion, the signs of the, times. the gathering of the Jews, And the certain judgments of   God which Await the Nations of the Earth (And further than this your servant has neither   taught nor practiced) I have been filled from time to time with the spirit of God And  a deep sense of the awful judgments of A Justly Angry God which stands like a  storm already gatherd And ready to burst upon the Nations of the Earth Esspecially this  Nation. And I feel to offer up the gratitude of my heart to my Heavenly Father  for his blessing to me thus far on my mission. Elders Rockwood, Haven, Carter,  Felt, Farr, Grover, And Appleby have been labouring more or less during the past  summer & winter in these Eastern States. And they almost universally make one report  ie they cannot get access to the hearts of the people, can not get them out to hear, And  if they do get a congregation together the word is like throwing A Ball against A rock,  it bounds back, or like pouring water onto a gooses back it runs off, And does not pene-  trate. they cannot get their bread among them, or means to travel, but have to call upon  the churches in order to live. I have generally found the same indifference manifest   by the world whare I have travelled, but few come out to hear & but few have been  Baptized. I baptized 3 in New Haven, Br Rockwood 3, And Brother Appleby  several in Philadelphia, & Cream Ridge, & several Baptized in other parts. I gave  Elder Appleby council to visit the Saints in Pennsylvania & New Jersey from time to time  as he had An opportunity And preach as doors were open. The question might be asked by  some why are the people of this Nation so indifferent about hearing or Embracing the gospel  while the work is rolling like fire in dry stubble in other Nations. I view this Nation in  as bad a state at least as the Jews were After puting the saints And Jesus to death, their day  of visitation in a great measure had past. This Nation in like manner have stoned And  killed the Prophets, shed the Blood of the Lords anointed, rejected the gospel, And driven  the entire Church And Kingdom of God with those bearing the oricles there of into the  Mountains of Israel, who before taking their departure with uplifted hand's to Heaven in  the Temple of the Lord, Justly cut off the Nation from the Church And Kindgdom of God,  for their Abominations, wickedness And Bloody, deeds. In Addition to this since that  period, the sins of this Nation have Apparently increased fourfold commencing with the  sin of sodomy adding Every other named in the black catalogue of crime, untill it is  like A flood that overflows its banks, And it seams as though not ownly the Holy Ghost  but that portion of the spirit of God that was given to Enlighten every man that came  into the world was taken its departure from the people, And they are going like the  ox to the slaughter & know not the Approach of their destruction

Our encamp-  ments are in the enjoyments of good Health, & spirits at  present. I Believe Brothers Stratton & Hanks have laboured  faithfully to accomplish the object of their mission  which will prove a benefit to the camps in general  We feel that we are remembered before the Lord by our  Brethren in the valley And that the Blessings of our  Heavenly Father may continually rest upon you & all  the faithful in Zion & the Travelling camp of Israel  is our daily prayer    Yours in the Gospel of Christ    W Woodruff

You will see from the Herald that the public mind sis strongly  called to the subject of annexing Cuba & Canidas to the  Unted States Canidas are about dissolving their alliance  with England. Spain is in debt & may sell Cuba to  the United States. Much is said in the papers now  about Freemonts party being destroyed by snow in the  Mountains & eating each other up.    There has never been so Hard a winter known in our day  so much snow & cold throughout North America as  during the past winter I feel anxious to know what  for a winter you had in the valley.    I have kept up a correspondance with Capt Joseph  Russell, upon the subject of assisting to pay the debts  contracted by the presidency for goods to help the camp  off, &c, & the Last Letter I got from Him, says He will  give me a draft for £300 $1452.00 to be drawn on   a House in Liverpool & should wait my orders to know  who to draw it is favor of. I made inquiry with Br.  Barnesto see if we could not cash it in Boston & send  it immediately to Elder Hyde thinking, it might be  a help in liberating his hands & G. A.

I would just say that before I left  home you and brother Kimbal told me to come and take care of my husband  I think I have done so to the best of my abilities, but were you to see him  you would say that he looks ten years older than when he left Nauvoo.

Will Brother Young be particular to see that Brother Player have  the enclosed addressed to him, as it contains matters of much importance, as  there is £150 in gold and a large amount of landed property fallen to  him by a flaw in a will which he can sell immediately on his arrival  and take the money. Could he not be among the first to get his  endowment and come over, get his money, & labour awhile in the vineyard  if he could be spared out of Zion. If he cannot stop to fill a mission  he had better come and get his money if he should return immediately  home. I should judge there were some thousands of pounds from what  is said. 
 secondly, with respect to the sabbath we allmost universally Regard  the first day of the week as the sabbath, but when God appeared  to Moses on the mount he commanded him to keep the seventh  day as the sabbath & not to labour on that day, so it appears that  if their has not been a change of the sabbath we as a bobdy are not  keeping the day that we were commanded to keep, still ist is held up  to view at this day that the sabbath has been changed, but is it not  allowed that there has not been no change in any of these commands  that were given to Moses at the time that the command of the Sabbath was  given & why has the sabbath been changed while the other commands  remain good & sacred & while we are under them & ought to obey them [##Exodus 20:8-11##]  it is maintained ^by some^ that Christ rose on the first day of the week & that  the work of Redemption was greater than the work of creation & this they  appear to consider as the change of the sabbath, but when we carefully  peruse the writings of the four Evangelist respecting the resurection of  Christ does it not appear as reasonable to suppose that Christ rose on  the seventh day as first, & even did Christ really rise on the first  day of the week, does that prove that it was a change of the sabbath  & if the sabbath was changed by the resurrection of Christ would their  not have been sumthing said respecting that change so that the   evidence would have been clear that the change of the sabbath was  then perfected. Sir this is a subject that has some length of time  ocipied a seat in my mind & I lay it before you considering you  have far deeper understanding of the word of God than myself & would  wish to know your views uppon this subject as I have not understood  the scriptures to be varry plain respecting the change of the Sabbath.    the third & last is the subject of  babtism & ist is a subject to that has long lain with wait [weight] on  my mind I think it not ownly our duty but our highest privledge  to take the word of God & make it the man of our council & form  our principles theirby still we may benifit by the instruction of  those that are more experienced than ourselves I for one fconsider  myself transacting business for Eternity & I believe that Jesus Christ  set the example for the pilgraim to follow & I believe that the christian  ought to strive to imitate his example as near as possible (allthough  I for one come far short of it) I at times have been allmost  overwhelmed in as^s^tonishment while meditating uppon the differences  of opinion & principle that exist in our land uppon religious subjects  when we have all the same bible to read the same spirit to direct  but more especially uppon the subject of babtism, my mind has  long been [illegible] with regard to this subject still I have remained  silent uppon the subject as I am of the opinion that every person ought to  be fully established uppon ^in^ principles uppon which much depends  I had the ordanence of infant babtism administered to me but it does  not answer my mind for I have not found any scripture to support  it from Genesis to revelation

 I have no fears that Either the Lord or those bearing the Keys of his Kingdom  on the Earth will condemn me or those who have laboured in this country during  the past season, for not converting this Nation to the gospel considering the state of  mind they are in. Yet we have our duties to perform And that I will try to do And  continue to preach the gospel to all people as far as I have an opportunity.    Soon After my arivel in Boston, I had an interview with Capt Joseph Russell of  Miramichi. I laid before him the Documents I recieved from Elder Richards Also  letters from Elder Hyde sent by Elder A. Cordon, both treating upon the same subject  ie Asking Aid of him to assist in paying some debts for goods deliverd to the Presidency for  at Winter Quarters to assist them And those with them, &c, which I presume you understand.  He said he had no means with him ownly enough to help him home; but He would consider  the subject. He laid his circumstances before me, And Asked some council. I Advised him  to follow the council of the Epistle; He said He would do it. He had the keels of three  vessels laid, said He would finish them; And lay no more, but sell to the best Advantage, He  codd could & go to the valley. I found him strong in the faith. I recieved A letter from  him A short time since. "He says "I have not yet seen any door open to make sail of my  property but intend to sell if possible And leave for the west by midsummer. my Property  is worth £5000 but what it will sell for I know not. "Concerning the letters you handed me  from Brs Richard And Hyde. I will say that I do not recieve my money ownly one in a year I  can tell in March what may be as to my help on the debts"  ^March 24th I recieved A letter from Br  Russell saying that He could now give a draft on a house in Liverpool for £300 for the Above object, which will  be forwarded to O Pratt to collect from him to O. Hyde to pay on the debts.^    Another case I wished  to speak of. I found numbers in Boston and the regions About finding considerable fault  with Elder Allexandar Badlam for doing so much for the Church for several years past,  And had become some what involved in debt. But after obtaining all the facts I could  in relation to the subject; I did not feel to condemn him, but to sustain him: for if  their was A fault at all in his doing to much it was one that men are so seldom guilty   of, that it was As good A subject for the cloke of charity as I could find. It is  true he had given to the full Extent of his means: And sometimes upon the exercise  of his faith, in all cases, where calls had been made upon him bearing the  signiture of the Presidency and seal of the church: yet he had contracted no debt  ownly in full faith of meeting the demand. He began with nothing, had no capital  yet his labour & business was lucrative. I do not know the exact amount of his dona-  tions; But I suppose som $3000 in all since He came Here. He assisted Br Benson in  means to help buy a mill, He bought the standard. Paid (I think) for the Press &  $100 worth of type for W. W. Phelps, clothed him, & gave him other Articles, the money  Brother Phelps collected in other branches to pay for the press, Brother Badlam thought  would be needed in the west. He also Assisted Brother Benson in his last collection  to help off the canp last spring, sent $600 dollars worth ^6 Barrels^ of varnish to St Louis  at the same time to be sold for the benefit of the Church (But I think it yet remains unsold  And left his business for several weeks, went with Br.

 be accepted without going to Liverpool I could do   nothing with it in Boston, & the order would not  be paid untill 60 days after sight & accepted, & this   could not be collected at Liverpool inand forwarded  to the Bluffs in time to pay debts in order to  liberate them in time to go this Spring but as  it was the Best I could do with it, I wrote him  an immediate answer saying that if He could not  manage it so as to raise the money on it in this  country so as to forward it to Elder Hyde this  Spring to make out the draft in Orson Pratts  Name, as He was in Liverpool let him collect it &  forward it to Elder Hyde the earliest safe opportunity.

He was 22 days from Boston  to that plaice. Had a good quick trip & all was well  New York abounds with many Charactertures intending to  represent the scenes in the gold digings one of which I  forward to president Young, with the bundle of paper  which I forward to you with Elder Appleby who  will also take my package of Letters to you.  Every letter coming from the valley that the public can  get hold of is publish far & wide. A Letter   from Sister Kimball to her Friends in Mendon  was published in the western and Eastern papers. you  will see it in the Herald, it is very good.

 Ireta Anderson  Morgan, Utah  Nov. 16, 1936    New York March 27, 1846    Dear Brother Little.  In great haste I sit down to say a few words to you before I  leave the City. Had a long intrview with Mr. Benson yesterday and  he exceedingly desires to do business with us he says if he does it  for nothing. I was much pleased with my interview with him. He a  appears to me to be a gentleman. I think it will be well to keep  upon good terms with him as far as possible.  I would life [like] to have  Emigration continue as fast as doors are open either by sea or lands,  but I think it right for us to see our way vlear [clear] in chartering ships.  by getting subscriptions among the Saints for that purpose before  running any risks, that would be detrimential to the course and a  disadvantage to the Church. I like the spirit manifested by Mr.  Benson with my interview with him yesterday. And as far as you can,  do business with him as cheap as elsewhere. I would prefer to continue  business with him, as he appaarently manifests much interest in our  welfare. I hope the Lord will open your way to get a goodly number  out by fall if not before. Bro.

 & if I may be allowed to use the expression it has been a mystery  to me how so many great divines that have been so long holding   up the light of the gospel & still sometime in so gross an error with  respect to babtism, for if I am not greatly mistaken I find no account  of John or any of the apostles administering the ordinance of babtism  untill they become believers in Christ or at least untill they considered  them true believers & that appeared to be all that was required of them  in order to be babtized was to believe that Jesus Christ was the son  of God & if they spiritually believed this they must be penitent believing  & respecting the mode of babtism it appears plain to me that their is no  room for one a moment to doubt but that our Saviour was buried  in babtism in the river Jordan and that all that the Apostles babtized  were buried with Christ in babtism & setting aside evry other example  but the one that Christ left us that alone aught to be sufficient  to convince mankind that emmersion was the rite & ownly mode   of babtism (to use the language of Dr. Daddridge Jesus had no sin to   was[h] away & yet he was babtized and God owned this ordinance so far as to make  it a season of pouring forth the spirit uppon him & this ought to silence  evry objection to the practice.    many advance the argument  that those things are not escential but may we not with the same  propriety say that when Abraham was called to offer his suon Isaac  that it was not esesntial whether he offered his son or a lamb out  of his flock & who of decided virtue will admit that the Lord would  have received Abraham offering with a blessing & given a blessing in   return had he offered a lamb in stead of his son, & why should any believe   that infant sprinkling will be as acceptable in the sight of God for  babtism as to follow the example that our Saviour hath given  has not Christ plainly told us that he is the way ^the truth life^ & if mankind ever   enter in to the kingdom of heaven must it not be by him isf so  then ought we not to obey his commands and follow his precepts   & not climb up some other way.    Mr. Phippen as I am  convinced of the mode of baptism, & believe it to be essential to  my prosperity & happiness the information that I wish you to communicate  to me respecting this subject is whether it is against your principle & discipline  to administer the ordinance of babtism to those that you consider to be  proper subjects without joining the Church for I at present am not  prepared to unite ^join^ with any Church still I feel it a duty to be babtized  & would wish to take up the cross when I have a fair opportunity  I have premeditated a conversation with you uppon this subject  but have delayed it as my brother is expecting to be babtized & I  have rather been waiting for him. Sir I have ^not^ intended any harm   by asking those questions & I wish you to excuse all you see amiss in  my remarks & by answering me you will confer a great favour    uppon Willford Woodruff

 Salt Lake City 13 apl 1880.    To President Taylor  and the Council    Dear Brethren,    While at the  Colorado Ferry I looked over the  Ferry a/c while in the hands of  Mr Fouts. I found that two-  thirds of the receipts had been  paid to those who had run the  Ferry. I proposed to Bro. John-  son that he take charge of the Ferry  and that he receive one half of  the Ferry receipts and the products  raised on the place. He to fur-  nish all assistance for running  the Ferry. I recommended also  that he have one uniform rate  of Ferriage either $150 or $200 per   wagon. But all these propositions   were to be submitted to the Council  of the Twelve for their actions.

On his return  from Phili his Employer turned him out of house & home. His creditors came  upon him for their pay, He found himself in debt about $1,400. He made a  settlement & gave notes: in some instances ownly 50 per cent was asked. Another  varnish maker stept forward And let him have $1000 worth of stock to make into  varnish to pay his depsts & would take his pay in his work, with this he began  rapidly to liquidate his debts, And labored for the man daily who furnished him with  the above stock, made varnished by the gallon, Earned with his hand labour from  $5 to $25 dollars per day. paid most of his debts, And in many instances  paid the 100 per cnt instead of 50.  He showed me A letter from President  Brigham Young counselling him to pay all honest dues &c. I confirmed the same  council to him told him it was his privilege to pay his debts then gather means And take  his family to the valley, in the midst of his prosperity the man that was furnishing  him with stock & Employing him, sold out. this left Br Badlam again out of  Employ, still some $600 dollars in debt. He had some stock on hand but no money  to buy spirits & Oil to make it up. at this stage of his affairs, the gold fever was raging  throughout this country almost to madness A company of young men of the world with  rich Parents acquainted with Brother Badlam were resolved to go to the gold digings  of of the Valley of the Sacramento. The young men being inexperienced in travelling  And their parents having confidence in Br Badlam as A man of Business of Experie-  nce in travelling &c came forward & offered to Advanced money to Br Badlam to paiy  his debts, give him an outfit to Calafornia, pay his fare there, And money to come back  with, in case he should not obtain means there And support his family while He was  gone. ^if He would Accompany them to the gold digings^ He laid the case before me. He thought the hand of the Lord was in it, that it  would liberate him from dept that He would earn as much from the offers made him  even if he did not ^get^ any gold thare for his goods or by diging, as He would to stay at home, and  after carefully considering all the attendant circumstances I gave my consent for him  to go And gave him A letter of Recommendation to you should He return by the way of  the valley. He set sail on the 2nd Day of Febuary, on board of the ship Corsair via  Panama & Chagres. I felt it my duty to be thus Particular in speaking of this case for two  reasons 1st That in case thare should be any complaint here after made against Br Badlam  upon this subject (which I presume thare will not be as his debts are now mostly paid) that you  might have An outline of the facts relating to the subject As far as I have been Enabled to  collect them lying before you. 2ndly That when I give my consent, aid or council to  A member of the Church to persue any course that seams to lead out of the main channel  lying before me I ought to give my reasons for it, that the Presidency may at one see the  cause and motive, which I have endeavord to lay before you, if he is successful, in few months

I do not look upon them as being  perfect in Every Respect, but as they are the ownly  settlemts in the order I have felt to Sustain    and Com 4 cts. The people are united & contented  as far as I could learn at Sunset. Brother  Lot Smith says He has written to presidet  Taylor concerning Tithing several times &  has never had an Answer. He would like   advice from the council to know what use  to make of tithing, or how to dispose of it.  It would not be profitable for the Church  to permit persons to Deposit wheat in   Utah, and Draw the same in Arizona,  as a Bushel of wheat is worth double in   Arizona what it is Utah. I think some  $1400 worth of Stock was turned out to  Sister Lee on the ferry at Sunset, and the  other Settlemts & I think most of it on  Tithing. Sister Lee has got her pay that was due  in stock and feels well satisfied. I had a long talk  with her at Sunset, she is Located at preset at  Taylor.

 Wilfords Desart 60 Miles from St Geog Nevada  Feb 15 1879    W. Woodruff  — His hiding place    Presidet John Taylor & Council,    Dear Brethren    As it  costimary for Elders to report at head quarter  conce[rn]ing their Labors in thare Ministry and missions  and not considering myself Exempt from this duty  I feel like giving a short Report of my Southen Mision  As you know I accompinied Br M Thatcher  to Nephi & Sanpete we had good Meeting  and I think much good was done, esspecially  in the orgainaization of the board of Trade By Moses  Thatcher a calling which I think He is well  qualified to fill, and I hope He will continue  his labors untill He Reaches St George. After He  left me I was Joined at Moroni By Brother  George Teesdale, and we held Meeting though  Sanpete Richfield and all the Settlements  wthare we stayed over Night untill we  Reached St George, whare He stayed and  Labored about two weeks, and got his work  done up in the Temple, and went his way Rejoicing    On the ownly beadstead in the House, and they  made up a family bead on the floor with the assistance  of some beding I brought. I have spent a week  in this Barren Desert, except while reading, writing &   Praying, with a gun on my shoulder Robinson  Cruso like visiting ponds, and a small river trying  to kill somthing to Eat the next day, But I found  it dull music the first day I killed 1 Goose, 8 ducks  and 6 quails, But that days hunting scared all the  wild fowl out of the country I near killed a fowle  afterwards But I was not as bad off as Nephi  was for I did not Break my Bow, and if I did  not kill any thing, the wife seared up somthing to  Eat so I did not go hundry. I could sccarcly keep  from Laughing alone to myself at the change in  my condition, A man that had spent as busy a life  as I had, and Now sevnenty two years of Age and  an Apostle in the Church, and Now wandering  alone in a Desert I with a gun on his shoulder  miles from Human habitation, trying to kill  somthing to eat, and what all this for, if it  was not for the word of God and testimony of  Jesus Christ it was for trying to keep one of the  commandmts of God, But then when I  compare my situation with the persecution and  affliction of the ancient Saints of God as well as

He fully beleives   that grain can be raised without  irrigation, upon those bottoms where  the water is near the surface and  breaks forth in small springs in  many places. Bro Greer also  thinks that an abundance of  water can be saved in a reser-  voir, that ^can^ be built in a natural  basin. I desire this subject consid-  ered in connection with my   former letter. The settlements here  need these meadows for dairies    and milk ranches, but have no  men to pspare to take them up    I think, if a company should  be sent expressly to occupy these  places they would take hold and  be satisfied; and do good. Some  come scattering along, and com-  mence rambling around looking  for places, these cannot be depend-  ed upon to do much good.    Bro Lake is fast recovering, but  Bro.

 He may be enabled to return & leave the country with honor & be enabled to remove his  family & perhaps others to the valley: this I would be glad to see him do for I do  think that Elder Badlam has endeavord to act in consent with the Presidency  of the Church, And made a great exhertion since he has been in this country to  do to his utmost to help the Church in their time of need. What I mean by the  main channel lying before me is I know I was not sent to this country to gather the  Saints to the gold digings of the valley of the Sacramanto. And Brother Badlam  is the ownly individual who has had my council to go thare. And the reasons I  ^have^ given. My council has been invariably to all the Saints to go to the valley of the Salt  Lake via Council Bluffs. I think that Samuel Brannan, And all other men that  have reflected at all upon the subject, can now see ("without looking through A glass darkly")  the wisdom of God in leading his servants the to the valley of the Salt lake to prepare  A place for the gathering of the saints instead of the valley of the Sacramanto: for  it appears to me from the signs of the time that this church a year hence  would have as much peace, quietness, or elbow room, in Hell, or the City of New York,  as they would in the valley of the Sacramanto. When I have reflected upon this  subject in connexion with the present universal commotion of the whole Earth. And read  the Account of your safe arival in the valley, And the camp of Israel with you; And the  crops, productions, & blessings of the valley: I have felt like shouting Hosannah—xx  to God And the Lamb, and to Praise the God of Israel that he has led his people  safely through the wilderness in the last days, And given them A quiet resting place  in the rich valleys of Ephraim, in the mountains of Israel. I have also rejoiced  much in the accounts recieved by the stars, And letters of the progress of the  work throughout the British Isles under the labours of Elders, Pratt, Spencer, Jones  And scores of Elders in that land, it indeed seams to be their day of visitation  And the Elders are in A rich harvest of wheat, And reaping day & night. But you will  get all accounts from that quarter by the Star; Elder Spencer, & those who came  from that Land. Elder Silas. P. Barnes of Boston is now preparing to join the  spring Emegration to the valley. Elder Appleby has been quite out of health during  the past season. Elders Little & Hardy have been engaged in Merchandize at Peterboro  during the summer to try to raise means to go to the valley. Please Excuse the length of  my communications to you at this time, it is not often I have An opportunity of forward  -ing by Private conveyance direct, And I wished to speak upon A number of subjects, I should  be pleased to recieve any News, word, council, or communication from the Presidency at any  time, they see fit to bestow it upon me. Mrs Woodruff joins me in sending our respects to  yourselves & families & the Saints in Zion we wishe Esspecially to have A place in yor prayers when  you go Before the Lord. And that the Blessings of the Lord may rest upon you & yours  at all times And in all things is the Daily Prayer of    Wilford Woodruff 
 He seemed Deeply interested in and   seemed to understand it much better   than I could have expected. He insisted  on my going home with him to Forest-   Dale and telling pedro the peace Chief   of the Natives. I went home with him   and had a Meeting with Pelone & Pedro   the two main Cheiefs of the Nations  I was thankful for the opportunity the   spirit of God Rested upon us all. Petone   Rehearsed to Pedro all I had taught   him in the Mountains, and they both   seemed Highly Delighted they both want  to go to Salt Lake & see the City and the   great Chief. If they go Brother Ebenezar   Thayne will accompany them. If they   do go I hope attention may be paid   to them that they may have a talk with the   president & council, and may be furnished  with a suit of cloths. I must say I   am struck with Wonder at the great inter-  est faith confidence & hope that the Chiefs    when any one, joins them they turn in   all the property they have good, bad or indifferent   all is priced by a committy, & named what it  is, if He wishes to leave, all the samye property   He turned in is returned to him if it exhists   in the same shape, if not, its Equivilent, some   think that all property turned in should draw   an interest of 5 or 10 pr cts, have a $1 a day for their   work, draw out of the Store House, cook & live at   home, & make a Dividend at the End of the year   where this has been tried one Man comes with   $5000, a wife & 3 children, another poor man comes   with $100, a2 wives, & 15 children, at the End of the year   the Rich man has a large surplus & the poor   Man in Debt all over, and all who has tryed   the system have soon had to break up.

 Indian [Mission]    Sunset, Apache Co., Arizona,    Sept. 15th, 1879.    President John Taylor and Council:    Dear Brethren:    I arrived on Saturday night, the 13th  inst., all well and in good spirits and found Brother Lake, of Brig-  ham City and Brother Btates, of pleasant Vallety, very sick. They had  been to the Verdie, baptizing some and administering to the sick.  Brother Lake has been looked upon as dangerous, but was some better  yesterday.    In my short communication of the 2nd inst., I promised to give  a more full account of my visit to the Islatus, which I will now en-  deavor to do. I view my visit amontg the Nephites one of the most  interesting missions of my life, although short. I say Nephites, be-  cause if there are any Nephites on this continent we have found them  among the Zunies, Lagoonies and Islatus, for they are a different  race of people altogether from the Lamanites. I class the Navajoe,  Moquie and Apaches with the Lamantiites, although they are in advance  of many Indian tribes of America. I class the Zunies, Lagoonies and  Islatus among the Nephites. (See Sec. 3, 17 verse, D. & C.). The  Zunies are in advance of the Navajoes, Apaches, or any other Laman-  ites. The Lagoonies are much above the Zunies, and the Islatus are  far above them all in wealth, in beauty, cleanliness and order of  their homes and persons, the adornment of their dwellings, their in-  dustry and indefatigable labors, the virtue and purity of their na-  tiojnal blood, their bearing and dignity in their intercourse with  strangers and, above all else, the expansion of their minds and cap-  ability of receiving any principle of the Gospel, lof endowments or  sealing powers, fully equal to the mind of any of the Anglo Saxon 
 those Settlements to the Bishop, as their is   no other Grist Mill in 100 Miles of our   settlements it leaves the tithing wheat 50   75 or more miles from the Mill and as  they are in a New County No conveniences   for storeing tithing grain. It will cost the   Church or some body sumthing to bring   this tithing grains 75 Miles to Mill would   it not be better for the people to bring   back the wheat to the Mill where they got   the flour from. We would like some   instructions upon these subjects. A man   applyed to me from Logan ^Sipeo^ to Deposit wheat   there I draw tithing here I told him I would   name it to you but one busheh of wheat   here is worth two there. I wish to say that   Br Lake is at work again. Brother Bates   getting Better, we have administered to them by   annointing with oil & lying on of hands and they   both have been healed.

 President Taylor and Council  Dear Brethren:    I want to say a few words  upon temporal matters. In my former letters  I stated the opinion of the brethren that the  company from Farmington could come to  Arizona better in Febuary and March, but  the times admonish us that nobody can come  in the winter at all. They will be under the  necessity of waiting untill spring untill the  grass grows, before which time niether teams  nor stock can travel. We would be glad  for early emigration for the purchase of Saint  Johns needs both men and means to hold   it. We are also about purchasing the small  upper ditch, water and land which we could  not get when we made the other purchase.    We baptized one of the mexicans at St. Johns,  an honest man apparently and zealous in the  Gospel. I ordained him an elder and gave  him instructions and quite a number of the  mexicans at St. John attended our meeting at  the mexican brothers house and brothers Tenney  and Nail preached to them in Spanish and our

He is  the Right man appointed in the Right place  He is doing much good as presidet of the Stake  of Nephi. He is a Man filled with the Holy Ghost  and bears a strong and powerful testimony and  is laboring to Build up Zion and the kingdom of God  and Not himself. An Excellent work in the  Temple is still kept up, the Brethren and sisters are well  united who labor there, there were over 100 Endowtments  given daily a portion of the time I was there.

On that Evening there arived  in St Geoge Marshall Stokes, the Marshall  from the Reef, and several other strangers,  all of them on urgent and important Business  of course, and among other things was vary  anxious to have an interview with me, but as  I could not learn that they had any Recommds  to the Temple I did not feel disposed to interview  them, And after I had spent two nights in the  Temple and the Marshalls Enquiring of the boys  in the street if they knew where a certain man    was and to top off with, after an aged Brother of  great Experience from the North country prayed  Earnestly in a public Meeting of Saints & Sinners  friends and foes, that the Lord would preserve  Brothr So & So calling him by name from the  U.

 them untill sumthing better can be advised  I have spent more time at Sunset than either   of the other settlemts. I can speak more advisedly   than of the others. I think Sunset has proved   itself a success in a tempory as well as spiritual   point of view. Brother Lot Smith who is the   presidet of the stake, takes the lead in the work   does as much hard work as any man in the Branch   faires No better than the poorest, and I think   has produced a good deal more for the support   of the people than any settlemt in the Mountains according  to the Number Employed. They as did Brigham   City lost hundreds of bushels of wheat by the   flood last year, yet almost Evry Mormon   Settlemet in Arizona have Depended upon   Lot Smith for their bread for the last   six months before harvest. He has distributed   to the Saints during the year I think from 15 to   20 Tons of flour & meal. and done it freely. &   when I left Sunset on the 29 July Br Lot Smith   had but 150 Acres of good ripe plump wheat   which I think I am safe in saying that it would    20 bushels to the Acre, & had 55 Acres more to   cut the latest they had & the best, that will   yield 40 bushels to the Acre, total of the wheat   crop 5200 Bushels And he   has but 11 Men &   boys at work on the farm, and he has over 100 Acres   of corn looks well, 30 of cane, 20 of Lucern &   some 15 Beets carrots & other vegitables, all his   other Men are at work at the waggon, Blacksmiths  sheep Heard, Steam Saw Mill, & Dairy quite a   settlement at the Mill & Dairy. The crops at Brigham   City are not near as good but what they have  are in the ben. They have cut their Early ^Sonora^ Sonora   wheat at St Joseph, rather light 15 bushels to the   Acre, later wheat Better, their corn & Garden   very good. Wheat at Snow Flake half cut   a fair crop. corn & vegitables at Sholo Creek   Read Head & Easts very good, corn & potatoes at   Father Cluffs looks well. corn & vegitables   at Forest Dale half a crop. No Irrigation last   year a great crop there. Mr Cooley a friend   to Mormons & Indians (having an Indian wife)   will raise 150000 lbs of Barley. Barley sells at 5 cts

 of the Trouble and that the Temples & Church   property are safe. I did not see John W Young   name in the list with the rest of the family   for I did not learn whether He signed the   paper Br Roseton took to him or Not    There is a question I wish to ask the   Trustee in trust Would it not be wisdom   for Lot & Jesse N Smith or those who   preside over these Stakes of Zion to have   the privilege of selling some of the tithing   wheat & turning it into Money instead   of keeping the wheat would not the   Money be of more Benefit to the   Trustee under the present state of   Church affairs than to keep the wheat   on land flour can be cashed at   the Mill for $6 a bushel or wheat at   $2 a bushel which is Double the price of   wheat in Utah Application is made   to Lot Smith for flower but He did   not feel at Liberty to sell any tithing flour   without the Court of the Trustee I have  been applyed to upon the subject and I    do not feel it my place to take any Respon-  sibility upon myself concerning tithing Money   or grains any further than to assist in   regulating the prices of tithing of this County   for the benefit of the Church. Some of the   Bishops offered me thithing Money I told them   to Deliver it to the presidents of the Stakes   who should forward it to the Trustee   the earliest opportunity, if I was going to   Salt Lake direct, I would take any tithing   Money & Deliver it to the proper proper   Authority on My arival as I at times   have done. Jesse N Smith has taken  some tithing money with him as He is going to   the Legislature. There is another thing I wish   to say Lot Smith has loaned a good   Deal of flour or grains to people through   Arizona during the past year to feed them   they were to return this back to the Mill   The Trustee probably not understanding the   situation I understand has given the people   the privilege of turning in their wheat in 
 mexican brother has baptized 5 of them and  a prospect of more. I think there is a fair   prospect of an effectual door opening in  Arizona to bring many of the Mexicans pop-  ulation into the Church. They are of coarse a   good deal mixed with the Indian blood.    We recieved a letter to-day from brother Haskel  He had arrived safe at San Juan after en-  countering huricanes and snow storms. He  found only 2 men and 3 women and 8 child-  ren in the settlement, and they had a fright  from a report that the Utes was coming to  destroy all on the river, but they did not do   it. Soon 3 men arrived from Silas Smiths  Company. they were still hemmed up and could  not travel, no road, had to blast thier way  with powder of which they were out. They said  it would take 300 lbs. more powder to blow  them into the river and out again and Silas  Smith had gone back to obtain the powder to  accomplish it. It seems quite a mistake  for companies to undertake to travel a road  with women and children in the winter, that has  not been explored. I think we should avoid  a repetition of it. I have heard the new boat    was in the river at Lee's Ferry. I am glad  to hear it. I wish president Taylor and  Council would change the name of that ferry.  I do not like the name. If it was changed  perhaps there might not be as many Ghosts  visit it and scare the women as there has   been in days that are past. There has been  strange stories told by the sisters who have  been to work there. We are beginning to  have cold weather in Arizona of late. Thermom-  eter has been showing for several mornings  past from zero to 6 degrees below which is   an uncommon thing for this country. I  expect Sunset people will finish threshing  tomorrow. Head to go to Snowflake and  borrow thier machine as the Clawson ma-  chine refuses to do any more threshing this  season. They will have about 3200 bushels,  which is less than what I expected, yet 2/3 of  all the Mormons of Arizona are looking to  these figures for thier years bread. It should  read 13000 in order to feed them untill  harvest. But Sunset are doing all they can  for the needy.

Our St George Conference commences  to day, warm & plesant John Henry and H J Grant  are attending the Meeting. I Expect to see  them Sunday Evening all Well with me  I had a plesant interview with B Y  And another Letter from Milton S  Ray, says the school with the Maricopa  children doing well, members can read and  write. He wants to go to Mexico in the  spring. I have advised him to make  arangements to keep up the schools with  the Maricopas & papagos, He says some  Sisters are teaching the schools    The Missionaries are vary anxious to  get the Book of Mormon in spanish  among the Lamanites and Mexicans  I will inclose to you a Letter I Received  from Brother Ray in sept. I have thought  there should be some provisions made 
 I wish to say to my brethren the Apostles  that I expect you to make whatever use you  please of the communication I have sent  you. I sent what the Spirit dictated to me  I do not expect any revelation to go to the  Church as the word of the Lord only what  goes through the mouth of John Taylor as  our president, only what is delivered in   our public meetings through the mouths of  the Apostles and Elders as they are moved  upon by the Holy Ghost    Your brother in the Gospel    W Woodruff    [upside-down text] I wish to ask Brother Taylor and Council  a question concerning myself. What does  the spirit dictate to you upon the propriety  of my returning to Utah in the Spring via  St. George and spend a few days there and   then on to Salt Lake. The 10th of March will  be over 3 years since the Temple was dedi-  cated. I work^ed^ in it at that date.

 race. While I have been standing in the midst of that noble minded  people, teaching them the Gospel, I could not make myself believe I  was standing in the presence of American Indians or Lamanites, neither  was I. The Islatus of which I speak is a village twelve miles be-  low Albequirke, on the Rio Del Norte, containing 3000 souls that  stand at the head of this class of men that I calol the Nephites.  They occupy forty villages, containing a population of 32,000, speak-  ing sixteen distinct languages, but nearly all good Spanish scholars.  I look upon this as a great field of missionary labor for some forty  good, faithful "Mormon" Elders, who should be able to speak the  Spanish, and I hope next Conference will call some of them, at least,  into the field. I visited this people, located in their homes, in  company with Brother Ammon M. Tenney, who had visited most of them  before and I think has done much good in opening doors among them.  He had baptized 115 of the Zunies on a former mission. My journey  and visit with him was a visit of observation and I was amply paid.  In what way, I do not know, but in almost ebvery village I visited,  they were looking for me. I can only make a brief outline from my   journal of our journey. On the 19th of Auguast, we entered the Zunie  village, containing about 3000 souls. The village stood on a piece  of ground; many buildings three stories high, the upper stories en-  tered by ladders at the top. There had been a heavy struggle in  this village between the Catholics and Mormon Zunies. The priests  had done all they could to lie about the Mormons and had drawn away  a few who had been baptized, but others remained firm. I went  through the old Catholic cathedral in the village; it looked as  though it were 500 years old. It had two bells hanging in the tower  and over the pulpit was some of the finest carved work in wood I

I got to first days rep^or^t of the   conference and read the speaches of the Twelve  and I can say with evry sentiment of   my heart Amen. Bro Lot Smith &  myself with several other Brothers start on   Monday to visit the Mogul villages some   50 Miles from here. That the peace Blessings  & power of God may rest upon you and give  you the victory over your Enemies is the   daily prayer of your Brother in the gospel WW 
 Dividend on other systems as they can   agree. I think the majority of those   in the other settlemets Rather incline to   live on the Individual systems, rather  than to coop on United order systems.   I have of Late been holding meetings &   visiting the Saints at Snow Flake, Bagley   Sholo Creek where Read Head & E. W. East lives   & to Cluff Settlement, & Forest Dale fair   Caspsrops growing in all the settlements. On the   1 Aug. I was invited by several of the Brethrn   to Accompany Petone the war Chief of the   Apaches in the forest on a hunt As it   was the first time I had a chance to form   an aquaintace with An Apache Chief I   thought it wisdom to accept of the   invitation, so I spent 3 days with him   & 7 other Indians, with Brothers ReadHead   East, & Thayne, I followed petone one   day on his hunt He painted & striped   himself with clay like An Antilope   Had a small shirt painted like an Antilop    put an Antelope skins head & horns   on his head, was then prepared for a   hunt. When he saw an Antelope or   Deer He would dismount get on the   ground approach his game on his hands   & knees and in Evry instance draw his   game to him and shot Evry one He see   Having killed 27 in this way During the 3 days   One days Hunt was sufficient for me   for I had to run my home 20 miles   the first forenoon to keep up with him   or be left in the forest, and when he   had 350 lbs of venison with himself on his   horse it did not cause him break   his gallop. We had prayers with him   Morning & night and I had a long   talk with him at the camp fire with   a good interpetor and taught him   concerning his forefathers, their Record   the Gospel Our Relationship to them their   future Destiny and as far Ias I felt it   Wisdom to communicate all of which 
 a Room by myself, well furnished with every-  thing heart can wish, good fire, bed, furniture a  plenty to eat, Drink & wear, and a good Father  and Mother to wait on me and No othr one in  the Neighhood knows whare I am. The Brethern  and Sisters in St George are Expecting to get  up a Birth day Benefit for me in the Temple  in getting Endowmnts for my dead. I am calculating  to spend the day with them in the Temple if the Lord  will. I think I can do it in safety. I wish to  say that it does not appear to me to be prudent for  me to attempt to appear openly at the April Conferce  in Salt Lake, and if I am not with you in person  I certainly shall be in spirit. I feel well, I have no  fears of any thing if we do our duty. I know God  Reigns, and the rejoicings of the wicked are short.  I will say that I feel thankful that all the Rest of  the Quorum are free men, and I say God Bless  you all, and when I think of Joseph and the  Prophets, and Presidt Taiylor in Carthage Jaol  If I was to have Nothing here, I would not be fit  to be in their company in the resurrection and God  knows I want to be with them somehow and I  will End by saying Your Brother in the Gospel    Wilford Woodruff

I am thankful  to say that my health is very good. I don't  know that I have enjoyed better health in  twenty years; my appetite is good, I sleep well  generally; I am at peace with all my friends;  but I cannot fellowship all the acts of my  enemies, among these last, are the courts, marshals,  and spotters of Utah Territory.

Cannon    Beloved Brethren,    Your vary kind and interesting  Letter of Oct 2 is Received, and Read with  much interest. And also your Epistle of  Oct 6 to the Saints. I feel that I can say Amen  with Every sentiment of my heart, to every principle  contained in Either of them. It certainly would  have been a satisfaction to me, and I presume It would  have been to you to have attended the conference  at Logan, but Wisdom Dictated otherwise, and  we have to be satisfied. Your position is ownly  following in the footsteps of the prophet Joseph  in his day. I have felt for a good while that  there was a change coming over Zion, over our  Nation, and over Great Babylon. And this in  order to fulfill the Revelations of Divine truth  and to carry out the purposes of the Lord. I cannot  but acknowledge the hand of the Lord in the present  afflictions of the Latter Day Saints. The persecution  of the Righteous by the wicked is a legacy bequeathed  to all Saints in Every age of the world and will  continue untill Christ reigns on the Earth.  And while all the powers of the Earth are combined  with the powers of Darkness and of Evil to Destroy  the Latter Day Saints from off the Earth it should  be a strong testimony to not ownly the Saints but  to sinners that the God of Heaven had set his  hand to Esstablish his Church and Kingdom on the Earth    in righteousness. I have felt at times as  though I wanted to get out to meeting and  speak to the people in thes southern settlements  but there is a Commissioner and several Deputy  Marshals appointed in this District and if I get  into the hands of my Enemies I should not have  the Liberty I now Enjoy. I lost my friend William  Squire with whom I have spent most of my time  for 7 months. He was sick 10 days. I Blessed him  a short time before He di[e]d and bid him good by He  was a true and faithful Latter Day Saint and a good  friend to me, and gave me a good home. I Received  a letter from My Daughter Bulah saying her  Mother (Phebe W) had met with a serious accident  walking in the Evening with a lighted Lamp caught her  foot in the carpet, fell her whole length struk her  head against the base board, cut a long gash in her  head, ^Dr^ Anderson had sown it ^up^ I Judge she is quite  badly hurt. I also learned that Sarah D. youngest  child was vary sick with Typhoid fever, but I have  to leave these things all in the hands of the Lord  and my friends. My Health is vary good at present  I get freequent letters from the camp of the Saints  in Mexico they seem quite Disappointed that they have  no land to settle upon, as they are in the midst of thieves  who steal them their Horses, Harness, Plough & Crops &c    Dear Brethren I thank ^you^ for your Kindness to me  in a temporel point of view    That the blessings of health, strength, & freedom may Rest  uppon you, and that the Inspiration of the Almighty may  Rest upon you is the prayer of your Brother in the Gospel W.

 brethren in the Temple last evening—who were  members of the Temple Association. I was glad  to meet them. As President Eyring was gone,  the propriety of appointing another President in  his stead was discussed; and Brother J. G. Bleak  was requested to write to you upon the subject, which  he has done.    Brother Snow left this morning, expects to hold  meetings in the settlements, as he travels, and  will go to Richfield and attend to the ordain-  ing and setting apart of a President and counsel,  according to your instructions.    Yes—the Twelve seem to be quite scat-  tered at the present. I expect Brother E. Snow  keeps you advised of affairs, and his doings,  in Mexico. I learn from a letter yesterday,  that Brother Snow is fast loosing his sight.  He had a fall into the river and bruised  his leg considerably, but not dangerously.  I was sorry to learn that his eyesight was  failing him to such an extent.    I received Brother Tenney's Recommend.  I expect him here in a few days.    I expect my daughter Clara and Brother  Ovando C. Beebe of Provo will forward letters  of recommendation to President Taylor, for

 ever saw, representing Christ, the apostles and angels. I went all  through the village and, for the first time in my life, I had a view  of the white Indians called Albinos. Their hair, face and limbs  were nearly as white as milk, much whiter than any Americans. I met  with many who had been baptized and they were very glad to see me.  They had 2000 acres of corn, looking well without irrigation. XOn the  day following, we visited their bvillage at their farm clalled Fish  Springs. I was here introduced to Brother Juan Boulista (John Bap-  tist), the first man baptized in the Zunie nation by A. M. Tenney.  His son's wife was the most handsome woman I ever saw of the Indian  race; had a beautiful child, nearly white. I went through their  wheat fields, which they were ciutting with sickles. We visited sev-  eral ruins of the ancient inhabitants; some of the outside walls of  stone were standing some eight feet high. On Sunday evening, the  25th, we held a meeting in a village of the Lagoonies, called Mosita  Negra. We had an interesting talk with the Governor of the place  (Jose Carido) and the spiritual advisor (Lorenzo Coreo) and both  wanted a meeting, and they called the people together, men, women and  children. We opened by singing and prayer and Brother Tenney spoke  to them in Spanish thirty minutes. I spoke a short time. Brother  Tenney interpreted and we dismissed, thinking we had kept them long  enough. As soon as we dismissed, a Nephite arose, full of the   Spirit of the Lord, and said, "Friends, why do you dismiss us and  leave us in this way. This is the first time we have heard of our  forefathers and the Gospel, and the things we have looked for from  the traditions of our fathers. If our wives and children are weary,  let them go home; we want to hear more. We want you to taklk all  night, do not leave us so." This speech raised me to my feet and 
 Salt Lake City, Dec. 17, 1885.    Presidents John Taylor and George Q. Cannon.    Dear Brethren—    There is a subject that I feel it my duty to write  upon. Brother Thatcher has sent me his correspondence with  you upon the subject of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement  Associations. I have read his letter and your answer, also his  reply to the same, and I have tried to carefully study them  all, and I must say there are some things in yours and  Brother Cannon's letter that I am surprised at, and as the  Superintendent of the Young Men's Institutions, I feel it  my duty to reply to it.    In the first place, permit me to say that while I view  all earth and hell, including our own government, in   every department, with priests, editors, wicked men, and  devils all combined to crush us, as the Church and kingdom  of God on earth, with all our institutions, as far as they  have the power; while I view this at our doors, and know  that nothing can save us but the power of God, I feel  that the Twelve Apostles should have the most implicit  confidence in the First Presidency of the Church, and

Cannon    Dear Bretheren;  Your letter of Dec 7th is received and I took the  first opportunity to meet with bro's. Richards, Lyman  Grant and Taylor and laid before them your  instructions. And had copies made of  your letter  for each of them and one for H. S. Eldredge  with whom I had an interview and as the  first Presidents of the Seventies hold weekly meetings  at Bro. Eldredges house I thought they might do  something in aiding the matter, and the Twelve  who are free are immediately going to visite the  different stakes for the purpose of carrying out  your instructions. I approve of your views in  calling for volunteers to settle those places instead  of forcing men to go as missionaries. What  success they will have in this matter time must  determine, but I think the winter is a very bad  time to travel over that route. I hardly think  sutch a company of men could be got together  to go before spring. My present health is good

Woodruff  City  Nov 254 [18]85   [end of sideways text]    Salt Lake City  November 21, 1885    Presidents John Taylor & George Q Cannon    Dear Bretheren    Your last letter to  me upon the subject of calling missionaries   etc was received. It is on file at the H. O and   the date is not before me, and the excuse   I have to offer in not answering before is  the death and buriel of my wife Phoebe and   the settlement of my affairs after the buriel which   in some respects was in an unpleasant  condition; and also being under the necessity   of moving by night from place to place for   my own safety. Therefore I trust this may   be a sufficient excuse for my seemingly neg-  lect on my part. I must confess it gave   me peculiar feelings to return to Salt Lake   where I had spent thirty-five years and built   four dwelling houses and now I find not a   place to lay my head. I could not attend the   funeral of my wife with which I had spent   about fifty years in the marriage covenant  The only privilege I had in the matter   was to look through a window at the H. O.   and see the prosession pass and view the   hearse that carried the mortal tabernacle    I will say I have had several copies of the  letter written and sent to E. Snow, M Thatcher,  and have been read to the Bretheren here  and will endeavor to do all I can in having  the counsel carried out. I did not know that  the Suprientendants of the Improvement associa-  tions had been called upon to call men in-  to the missionary field. I enquired of Bro. Franklin  about the matter and he said he had called  upon the Presidents of two stakes to supply call  a certain number of men as missionaries and  they had not made out the number called  for, and ^Bro Richards^ he asked two suprientendants to present  the names of some of the most suitable men to  the President of the stake for his approval, and   that none have been called only upon the ap-  proval of the President of the stake. I am very  good health and spirits at the present time  and am using the best wisdom I posess  to take care of myself. I do not move at any  point only in the night.    The funeral of my wife was watched and  inquiries have made by marshalls if I was  in the City. I pray that the blessing and peace  of God may be with you, and that the Lord  may deliver you from all your enemies    I remain Your brother in the gospel    Wilford Woodruff

BOX 321,    Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug 20 1886    St. George, Utah,    Presidents John Taylor & George Q Cannon    Dear Brotheren,    Your letter of July 13  reached me at St George.  My position here should have some  explanation. I stayed 34 days in  Ashley and the surrounding country  when duety and safety seemed to  require me to leave. Marshal Brooks  of Ashley had just returned from  S. L. City while there he got his  papers renewed and two Marshal  had taken him over Jordon to  show him how to raide Houses  he assisted in serching Bro. Batemans  place after learning how to work  he returned to Ashley and brought  the two Salt Lake Marshals with  him. Brooks sold afll his property  in Ashley and sent his wife to  Denver so as to have nothing in  his way from commenceing work in

 intelligent Industrious & Wealthy of   all the tribes of the Western World They are   also numerous live in good Houses, has farms  women use cooking stoves & sewing Machines  They have never been visited by our Missionaries   But Brother Tenney is very anxious to visit   them, and open friendly Relations with them   and I Received an Invitation from Jesse  N Smith to accompany him and I feel   Exceedingly anxious to do so. In fact I have   of late had a very strong Missionary spirit   Resting upon me esspecially to go to the Laman-  ites for I feel that the Lord is at work with   them, and It seems as though I had providen-  tially fallen in company with ^a great many of^ the Navajoe—   Moque & Apache Chiefs and I have felt   inspired to preach to them. And as I now   have an oppertunity of visiting the Zunis   and Istatus tribes with good Interpetors   I feel that I cannot spend my time to   any better Advantage. Brother Tenney   is at Savoia will come to Round Valley for  me. We have a few men that have the name    of Mormon, who came to Arizona ^without^ witht  Recommends and dont want any, did not   come to serve God or build up Zion, but   to serve themselfves, they would have been   better to have staid at home some of them   have gone back and it would be well if   others would go but they are not many   the people as a general thing are trying to   live their Religion I think Broth Jesse   N. Smith is doing very will, has many good   Saints to preside over. Br Wm J.   Flake is a doing a great Deal for Zion &   the poor. I think He has fed tons of   flour to the Arkansas Saints, and others   who are Destitute and He has bought   from $15000 to $20000 dollars worth of Ranches   in Arizona for the Saints to Settle on   I have been almost afraid He would   swamp himself in the operation. But   I feel as though I had said about Enough   about affairs in Arizona for the present   We have had some Rains in the country   Enough to put out the fires that have 
 the privilege of visiting St George Temple to  attend to some important work. I hope   they may be found worthy to obtain President  Taylor's signature.    I saw the account of the arrest of Bro Budge.  The Government officers do not seem to pay any  attention to principles of law or equity in  dealing with our people.    I have been somewhat  surprized at the tardiness of some of our  people in Registering, when the liberties of  the people depend so much upon them.  But I hope enough will register to keep the  political control.    I feel that we have much reason to thank  the Lord for the manner He has over-ruled  the Edmunds-Tucker Bill, in its final passage,  which has taken the power out of the hands of  our enemies to rob us of office and property  according to its original intent.    I am pleased to learn that Bros John W.  Young and Nibley and others are making themselves  useful in Washington, and that we still have  an army of missionaries ready to labor  among the Gentiles in the various nations of  the earth. I think it is our duty to so  warn the Gentiles, that they shall be left 
 It does appear to me that I have never Read  in the whole history of the World any  Nation taking such rapid strides to prepair  themselves for the Judgments of God as are  the United States to day. whole pages of  the publications of the day are taken up in  the recitation of their Dredful Murder, rapes  and the Abominations of the Earth, and all  the government officers who are sent to admin-  ister Justice to the Saints seem in a terrible  hurry to fill up their cup of iniquity. They are  filled with madness, and Act mo[r]e like  Demons than wise men to Judge the people  by Law and Equity. And I am sorry to say that  I am not able to see any saving or Redeeming  quality in any Department of our Government  The Supreme Court the president, The Cabinet  The Congress or the Majority of them seem com-  bind to destroy the Saints of God from off  from the Earth, and their is a great meen-  ing to all this And no man possessing the  spirit of God, and of inspiration can help but  observe the signs of the times and of beholding  the Dreadful Storm which is approaching  our Country and the Nations of the Earth  The Lord is not slack concerning his promises  for what He promises He will fullfill, his words  will not pass away. fifty four years ago last  January a few Saints in Ohio prayed the Lord to stay  his Hand in Judgment. He said He could not  Deny his word. If the people would Repent  of their sins He would stay his hand in Judgment  but not without. I think the present Generations  are far from itRepentance. I feel the force of  your Remarks in the Epistle to myself and my Brethren  the Apostles, of the great responsiblity which Rests  upon us. And while I am shut up like a caged  Lion, and cannot open my mouth in the congregations  of the Saints or sinners. I am strongly Reminded of  the word of the Lord to the Elders of Israel on the   11 Sept 1836 when He says "If you believe me you  will labor while it is called to day" Again we are  told that soon night will come when No man can  work. When I look around myself and ask where  are the ph prophets and Apostles who laid the foundation  of this Church and Kingdom on the Earth, with whom  I was associated in Kirtland and Nauvoo. They are  gone, gone into the spirit wor[l]d, where I shall soon  follow, and there are but few left of thos days  others have taken their places, but it matters not if  we have done our duty. But I fear that many  times as Elders of Israel, We do not Realize the  great responsibility which Rests upon us  while we hold in our hands in a measure the  destiny of the souls of men in the generation in  which we live Jesus has told us it is our  privilege to know the signs of the coming of the Son  of Man It does appear to me that the signs of both  Heaven and Earth indicate his coming. And looking  upon the other hand it appears as though there was  a great amount of work to be performed before that Event-  ful day. Still the Lord is able to cut his work short 
 that they should have confidence in the Twelve Apostles,  and that we should be united both in faith and works, to be  the better prepared to steer the ship of Zion through the terrible  storm that is approaching us. I will here say that I   have endeavored to sustain all the authorities of the Church,  over me, from the day I came into the Church until the  present hour, and I expect to still continue to do this du-  ring the few remaining days I have to stay on earth, and  I have no disposition to do otherwise; and whatever the  head of the Church decides for us to do concerning the Mu-  tual Improvement Associations, for one, I shall endeavor  to carry it out to the best of my ability. But I feel it my  duty as Superintendent of the institutions, to express my  views on the subject, for if there is any thing wrong con-  nected with this matter, I feel that the responsibility, in  a measure, rests on my shoulders.    President Taylor, I will confess I was startled at the  idea that you had discovered that the institution was  forming a separate body from the Church and holy  priesthood, and was belittling the priesthood, or that it  was not an institution organized by the priesthood; for  I have always understood from the history of the institution  that it was organized and directed in the beginning from 
 with the exception of a slight cold. I am still  a free man, but do not know how long I  may be, but shall endeavour to do the best  I can. I wrote you on the 21st of November  in answer to your letter upon the subject of  the calling of missionaries, which I trust you have  received. I remain your Brother in the Gospel    Wilford Woodruff

 of my wife to her last resting place, as far  as the body was concerned, but this is the lot   of an elder in our day; but one thing I may   be thankful for is this. I arrived in time   to see her while alive. I spent one day and   night with her. The evening before I met   with you I felt impressed to call upon her   and did so with Brother Jacques and Beulah   present. I anointed her for her buriel.    Pheobe seemed to marvel at what I was   doing, not realising that she was so near   her end, after anointing her I laid my hands   upon her and blessed her and bid her   good bye, and sent my love to my friends in   the spirit world: aAnd left her for the last   time. She died at two o'clock about eight hrs.   after. I did not see her after she was dead    I prayed to the Lord in the begining to   sustain me through what I saw and was com-  ing to pass which he did do in a wonderful   manner. I could not have believed I could   have lived and passed through such a   scene with the same composure, calmness, and  serenity and reconciliation of mind as I did   through her death and burial, and not shed   a tear for while my wives and children were   bowed down with sorrow, I had to hold them    up through this trying ordeal. This in connec-  tion with my first meeting with eleven of the   Apostles. aAfter greeting each other we entered   into the labor of the examination and trial   of Albert Carrington which lasted from seven   o'clock till four in the morning, all of which   had a tendancy to depress the spirits of   almost any man without being supported   by the power of God. I will close this part of   my subject by saying that I felt perfectly recon-  ciled to the departure of my wife. cConsidering   her bodily condition I believe it far better for   her to go to rest than to remain any lon-  ger amidst the troublesome times.    I felt sorry to learn last evening of the   arrest of Bro Lorenzo Snow. It looks to me that   he was imprudent in spending so much   time with his wife Minnie in that Brick   house, when any anall acquianted with his cus-  tom knew that he had made that place almost   exclusively his home. It is true that I and   others of my brethren may fall into the hands   of our enemies not withstanding the precautions   we may take. I don't wish to cast any reflections   on upon any one in these matters.    Now concerning this subject of calling of   missionaries of which you speak. 
 2    Ashley he dare not arrest men there  alone for the Indians had threatened  his life if he did but now as he  had two Marshals to help him  and some backing of Anti Mormons  and Apostates they were prepared to  comence work it was beleaved by  my friends that brought out  papers to arest one L. A. and a number  of Poligamaist in the place and some  friends who professed to understand the  inside track were sure they were  going to com^m^ence a raid on the early  morning of the 23 of July by searching  the premises of my Son-in-law  Henry Woodruff where my family was  stopping my friends were very urgent  that I should leave the place that  night. Bishop Glines the probate  judge and a brother Colwell  volunteered to firnish team and accompany  me to any place I would go so I  accepted the offer and at ten o'clock  in the evening of July 22 I left  Emma and five children in tears  got into a lumber wagon traveled  all night and 16 days on rout was 
 the next hour was one of the best meetings we had. We all felt in-  spired, missionaries, Nephite men, women and children. I spoke and  Birother Tenney interpreted. I never felt the want of tongues more  than on this occasion. I taught the things of the kingdom of God  and found hearts capable of receiving it. All were deeply interest-  ed and the seeds we had sown in the hearts of that people will bring  forth fruit. At the close of the meeting, the man who spoke in the   meeting came to me and said, "WHhen you return, drive to my home and  all your wants will be supplied, (which we did do and held another  meeting on the Sunday following, and should have baptized him and the  Governor and many others, I think, if the Governor who had followed  us as did the spiritual advisor, some sixty miles to Islatus and had  not returned and the people did not wish to take any steps until their  Governor was with them.) On the following morning, my carriage was  surrounded by the Governor and people that we had talked to the night  before and some of them took breakfast with us and I had to talk to  them on the principles of the Gospel and their record and signs of  the times, until I left, and the leading men of the village foollowed  us sixty miles to Islatus and stopped with us most of the time we  were there. On the morning of the 26th of August, we drove through  Friscoe, crossed the Rio Del Norte, which we found very low and en-  tered Albequirke, containing about 3000 thousand inhabitants, Jews,  Gentiles, Americans and Mexicans. I was introduced to Judge Parks,  the U. S. District Judge of that District, from Illinois. I went  through the city or town. It is quite a place of business. I went  through the Catholic cathedral accompanied by an Italian (Padre) or  priest. He took great pains to show us everything in it. Robes of  the priests and deacons; some robes woven from pure gold thread that 
 To the City of Washington and where the  Land breaks in peaces the Nations, and  Rewards those Heirs, Lawyiers, & Judges according  to the Deeds done in the body, and when  the Hasty Emigration of the Ring out of  Salt Lake is Ended, I think the Saints  of God will find the City ofSalt Lake  with all the Temple in Zion Standing upon  their foundations. Therefore rejoice in  the Lord ye Apostles of the Lamb, Even  in tribulation & trust in God for He  will fight your battles and you will  come off victorious in the End.

 Pres W. Woodruff  City  Dec 22 [18]85.    Presidents John Taylor & G Q Cannon    Dear Brethren    In looking over  my communication to you  I see in speaking upon the  subject of the warfare that is now  approaching us I may have left  the impression that I had my fears  fears for the finall safety of  the Church & Kingdm of God, if so  I wish to correct it, for I know  that the Bible, Book of Mormon,  & Doctrin & Covenants are the  Revelations of God to Man & will be  fulfilled. The Zion, Church, & Kingdom  of God will come off triumphant  in the End but how much suffering  & tribulaton the Lord will permit  to come upon the Saints is not for  me to say I think I Realize that 
 the highest authority in the Church, and has been encouraged  by the Apostleship from time to time, including President  Taylor. President Cannon has heard me express myself in  plainness before large congregations of young people, that there  could be no organization in the Church, which could have a   separate interest from the kingdom of God and from the  Holy priesthood. I said the Primary, sabbath school,  Improvement Associations, Relief society, or any quorum  of the priesthood, could have no separate interests, or organizaton,  or independence outside of the Holy priesthood and governing  authority of the Church and Kingdom of God. These were  my sentiments then, are now, and will be to my grave.  I will say that I have never taught, have never heard any  other person teach, in the Young Men's Improvement  Association, any word that would have a tendency to  draw them away from the Priesthood, or make them   independent of it, or belittle the Priesthood. The very fact  that three Apostles preside over it, and that the Stake Superin-  tendents are High Priests, and many of the other officers  and members possess the Priesthood, would entirely forbid  such a thing.    With regard to the Young men's Mutual Improve-  ment Association turning their meetings into the various 
 Brother Bleak has  Just read me the dispatches  of to Day the 13 saying that 11 at  to 4 of the grand Jury voted to  clear A M Cannon on the  2 Indictment, and that Dixon &  Varien had Resigned and Reported  that Murry had, and that Zane  is called to Washington. Thank  the Lord for so much may we  have peace for a Month 
 without excuse in the day of Gods Judgements  upon the wicked. We still find some honest  souls who are brought into the fold of Christ.    I was sorry to hear of the death of Brother  Kimball, but we have the consolation of knowing  that he laid down his life while in the path  of duty.    I will notify the brethren named in your  letter of their appointment to the Lamanite  Mission.    Concerning the Sheep-herd: I will say  as soon as the brethren can shear and settle up  their liabilities, they will know how they stand.  They would like to settle up and close their business.  And return to the owners, their sheep.    All is peace and quietude with us in Dixie;  and a general time of health with our friends.  The brethren report having had a good  Conference.    I see there is an unusual amount of  Earthquakes in North America this season; es-  pecially in Mexico. Some of the brethren think  the earthquake near their settlements has been  a blessing to them—by adding double the amount  of water to their streams for irrigation.    I pray God, my heavenly Father, that  He will clothe President John Taylor

Cannon    Dear Brethren,    Your letter  of Feb 14 Reached me in safety. I have written  to Brother Tenney upon the subject of the Mission  I travelled with Brother Tenney in 1879, in visiting several  tribes of Indians including the Zunies, Lagoonies & Islata   I consider him Well qualified to Lead a Mission amo^n^g  the Lamanites who understand the spanish Language. He  can preach about as well in that as in the English, He  seemed to have the spirit of the Mission while I was   with him. I told him if He would commence his  mission with the Maricopas, Pemas, & Papagoes, who are  near the Yaquis, that it would be Well, as several of  ther Chiefs who visited you in Salt Lake have been baptized  and many of ther Members. We have a school Esstab-  lished with the Maricopas. These tribes named are an  agricultural people they Raise a great deal of wheat, I do  not think Brother Tenny could find a better field.   He says his imprisionment has left him in poor circumst-  ances financially. I Also informed him that you  would not object to granting his request upon the  other subject.  I wish Brethren to say sumthing  upon another subject It is concerning an affair of  Brother Benjamin L. Croff. He may have written to you  upon the subject. Heis home is Minersville but he has been  obliged to Leave for the same cause that some of the Rest of us  have, and has been a Neighbor within 40 feet of me for some

 [sideways text]  Pres W Woodruff  St George  Sept 30 [18]85  [end of sideways text]    In the Temple of the Lord Sept 24, 1885    Presidents John Taylor & George Q Cannon    Beloved Brethren    Your vary interesting & consoling Letter of  Sept 17 is received, Also A letter of Date July 30 was  Received, for which please receve my thanks. I came down  to the Temple last Evening to attend to the Marriage of  Edward Snow the son of Erastus, as his Father was not at  home to attend to it, he requested me to, which I did this  morning. I had a plesant interview yesterday with  R. T. Burton & E. F. Sheets who are here on Church business  I also had an interview with Elder Roberts who done most  of the preaching at the conference, & people were much Edified  I also had an interview with Jacob Hamblin. I gave him  a mission to the Lamanites as he is not allowed to stay at home  and his mission has been to the Lamanites for many years  and he seems better qualified for that mission than to the gentiles.  There was a Telegram sent here from Beaver saying that somebody  had told Marshal Armstrong (A cock & bull story) that I with  Thurber Spencer Bagly & others had threatened to throw Armstrong  & his papers into Fish Lake if He came there to Arest any body.  there was No such threats made, nor truth in it. But there was a  man in Beaver (said to be a Reporter) took it up, and has tryed to make  some black mailing out of it. But president Murdock has been  communicated with to ^see^ Armstrong, and correct the matter with him,  for we have all of us but the best of feelings with him as A Govern-  met Officer, for he has behaved more Gentlemanly than any other  one in the service. I think it will be setled without Difficulty  but this caused me to leave the Room I have occupied of late,  and I went back to my old retreat whare I had spent several  months. And I found my old friend vary sick, and next morning    clensed & purified. The Saints tried & proven, when the cup of iniquity  of those who are persecuting the ^saints^ is filled, and when the United States  Government is Ripe for the Harvest, And it does appear to  me I never saw a field ripen as fast. Brethren you  have my prayers Day and night for your health, prosperity, and  deliverance President Taylor has once suffered Marterdom If ^it^ is the   Will of God I pray that may suffice. If those wicked men had you  in their possession, They would never want to let you go alive.  And I pray you may be kept out of ther hands. George Q is also  a brave man, and my chafe under confinement, but do he  protest; I was sorry to hear of the sickness of Abram H  we pray for him and hope the Lord will preserve his life. All  the Saints of God around me wish to send Love & blessings  With regard to myself I thank the Lord I am able to say  I am Enjoying good health to day considering my Age and  close confinement. I exercise when I can in safety. I feel  as though we need Revelation Every day in order to know  what to do. We are all in the hands of God, and he is not so  far away, but what he shows his hand. I think He did on the  24 of July In Ordaining Gen Grant to officite in his last  act as a scape Goat to bear off the sins of the Mormons, and  to cause president Cleveland to command all the United  States to put the flag at half mast, and Governor Murry is  particular to commend the command the Citizens of Salt Lake  to do what they were going to kill the Mormons for Doing doing  And the soldiers of Camp Douglass are sent to fight the  Salvation Army, or some other Army instead of the Mormons  They may not acknowledge the Hand of God in this, but I do  The Lord and the Heavenly Hosts are watching over  us And the Lord will Defend his Saints his Anointed  and his friends. Therefore have courage, onward brethren  to Deliverance to Victory, to Glory, and Eternal Life

 Quorum meetings, I will say I have felt for a good while that the  various quorums of the Priesthood do not live up to their privileges  in meeting together as they should, and getting the spirit of  their calling and mission upon them. But the Young  Men's Associations have gathered together hundreds if not thou-  sands in their meetings that have no priesthood, and today  would be mingling with the wicked if they had not been  gathered to the meetings of the Young Men's Associations.  Then there are hundreds of the better class that have no priest-  hood, and belong to no quorum, and would not attend  the quorum meetings. Now I did not know  that you had any objections to the conferences of the Young  Men's Associations, only upon the ground that they  interfered with the Sabbath schools. I did not know  that Brother Cannon had any objection, only on that  ground. Now the Sabbath Schools hold their unions  once a month, and they are of vast interest, and among  the most interesting meetings in the mountains, and  have a great influence for good among the rising gene-  ration. But if these meetings were stopped I think it  would be an immense injury to the Sabbath Schools

And I pray that President George Q. Cannon  may remain in the flesh, unto the coming  of the Son of Man. And I see no reason  why he should not; and I believe he  desires it.

 time He has been engaged in Mining in consequence  of his having to Leave. Philo Farnsworth of Beaver  has taken the advantage of his situation and Jumped  his mine; And Farnsworth told one of the Brethren  that He intended to get Croff before the Grand Jury and  they would place him where He could not defend him-  self before the Court, as the Marshals have offered $100 for  Croff. And as Croff could not go to Court the case was  tried before the High Council in Beaver and when it was  investigated it was clearly proven that Croff had fulfilled  all the Law Required. But president Murdock Decided in  favor of his Son in Law Philo Farnsworth. On the ground  that Br Croff was not a Bonded Officer. He said if Croff had  given bonds as the Recorder of the Mining District He would have  decided in his favor, so He took the Mine away from  Croff & gave it to Farnsworth. I look upon it as a vary  poor Excuse for Rendering such a Decision. 5 of the 12  Counsellors voted against his Decision I Read a   copy of the Records of the decision. In my mind  the cause of Farnsworth towards Croff borders upon a  Criminal Action in laying a plan to get Croff into the hands  of the Marshal so he could steal his mine, and deprive  Croff of the power to defend himself. He could not have   defended himself before the High Council in Beaver without  Being Arested, his Brother done the best He could He wanted  to Appeal the case to the first presidency, But He has to  leave the County in the case of poligamy.

 cost $1000.00. There was much more wealth than I would have looked  for in as obscure a place as Albequirke. We spent the day in the  place and left in the evening and camped five miles below on the  banks of the river. On the 27th of August, we entered the village  of Islatus (Ysleta), being the day before the great annual feast of  this people. Brother Ammon M. Tenney had visited this people three  years ago and had madde friends in the place. We called upon an iold  patriarch that had received him before. His name was Juan Reylocero  (John King). He was golad to receive us. He furnished us with  mutton, fruit and anything we needed. He was one of the leading  spirits and most influential men ofin the village over 80 years of age,  but his labor and activity did not show 70. It should be understood  that the Catholic power has had dominion for centuries over most of  the American tribes. This is the case with all these tribes, as well  as others, and the priests who now occupy their villages are mostly  French or Italian. The priests who dwell in Islatus has had a hard  contest with the old patriarch, because he had received the Mormons  and their religion. He told the priest that he had his own rights  and agency and no men should take his rights or religion from him,  and they had not spoken to each other for two years, and this spirit  is manifest through all the tribes when the Gospel is preached and  the Lamanites and Nephites throughout all the land are beginning to  be weary of the Catholic priests and their religion. The inhabit-  ants of Islatus stand at the head of these 32,000 Nephites; all the  other 40 villages come to them for counsel. They have their own  laws, police courts and judgment seat. They are very rich. The  man we stopped with possessed 9000 sheep, 100 brood mares and horses,  100 mules and asses, 500 cows and oxen, a ranch worth $8000.00, and 
 and a suicidal policy for us to require it.    Now, brethren, my thoughts have run in this chan-  nel. You have 50,000 Sunday School children in Utah.  Now are these 50,000 children going to remain children?  No. They are going to become young men and women, and  I ask myself, is it a wise policy for us to fetter them and  deprive them of remaining in the improvement Associa-  tions, where they can advance? If we do, it appears  to me, it would be just as unwise as it would be to stop  the meetings of the Sabbath School children. I think it  would be a great injury to our young men and women.  I have never known the Sunday School presidents or teachers  to attempt to form a separate interest from the Church  and Priesthood. Neither have I the Mutual Improve-  ment Associations. The object of the Conferences of the  Young people is to encourage each other, and I think  they have done a great deal of good. I will confess that  my circumstances have not been such that I could  attend or meet with as many of these conferences of the  Mutual Improvement Associations as I could wish.  I have always endeavored to attend them when circum-

In consequence of his sickness I have Returned  back to the Room I left whare I am now stoping (Except today in the  Temple) The most Exciting News we had was the Dispatcher saying  that Bishop John Sharp had taken the same course that Arnold  had. It was a shock the people had not looked for, I should have  looked for it in Many other Men before him. I would rather have  been shot Dead and let my body Rest in the Tomb and my spirit Enter  the spirit world free, so I could look the Lord in the face & the Prophets  & Apostles with a clean conscience instead of meeting that terrible  Hell that such men will have to face. Of course the ring and  Tribune will now glory in such a Victory, but his joy will not  be great, but his sorrow will. For a man with the knowledge &  opportunity that John Sharp has, for him to agree to desert  his family to carry out the Dictation of such courts as now reign and  break the Covnents He has made with his family, his friends & his God  He will meet sorrow such as he does not now comprehend. I would  rather be struck with Lighting, And I would Rather Evry son I have  on Earth would be struck Dead than to persue such a course  for imprisionmet & Death are light compared with that Hell  sons of perdition have to meet. whare is the man in Heaven  or on Earth who dare meet that Doom. No man Dare do it  who has Enough of the spirit of God, and Inspiration to see the  future. I pray the Lord with all my imperfections that I may never  be left to meet that fate. Let me meet imprisonment or Death    as the Lord will, but keep me from betraying my covenents, my  friends, my family and my God.  My spirit is stired when I  think when I think of these things If John Sharp Ever has  the privilege in the spirit world of meeting with Joseph Brigham  The Twelve and his many friends what will be his feeling, sorrow  and Affliction. Well let us drop that curtain. Under these circ-  umstances we hardly know what to look for in Men untill  they are tried.

It does appear to me the haste our Nation is  making to get ripe, that the day is at hand when the Lord  will come out of his hiding place, and give this Nation  and its officers sumthing Els to do besides Hurting and  Imprisionig the Elders of Israil, for obeying the Commandments  of God.

As soon as I received your letter with the afore-  said instructions, dated Jany: 14, 1886, and covering  a letter from President F. A. Hammond, dated Dec. 23,  1885, from Bluff City, I called upon as many of  the Twelve Apostles as had their liberty and could be  reached. They came together accordingly and  deliberated on the best means of engaging the attention  of the Saints generally upon this subject. Each  one of the Twelve had a portion of the Territory  assigned to him, in which to operate. A certain  quota of the desired number of colonists was de-  cided on as proper for each stake to furnish, ac-  cording to the ratio of its population. The brethren  of the Twelve went among the people, and for a

I have never Giv-  en instructions to any one upon this  subject, contrary to the teachings of  your letter. I have never seen Angus  M. Cannon since he came home. I  have asked Bro.

I have thought and still think  that great good has been done by both institutions, and I  would be certainly very sorry to see any steps taken to deprive  either society of these privileges in the present state of the  warfare we have to meet from the outside world.    Now, if President Taylor or President Cannon know  of any superintendent or teacher of the Mutual Improve-  ment Association who has taught in that Association  any principles that have had a tendency to draw off  from the Church or Priesthood, I would take it as a  great favor to be informed of the persons, time, and place,  for it is something I know nothing of. If there is  anything in my teaching, or my counsellors', that   is not right or in accordance with the Holy Priest-  hood, or the Kingdom or Church of God, or the Holy  Spirit, if the Presidency will point out to me, I  will thank you, and endeavor to reform.

But it is now reported that he is  returning to this place with other  marshals with papers for men, and  some think for L. A. and others, and  in consequence I think it wisdom  I think to take a place out of sight  for a season.  But bretheren it is not  for this purpose that I write to you  It is upon the situation of this Ashley  ward that I wish to write.  I do not  know of a ward or stake in the whole  Church that is more divided than this  Ashley ward. It seems that the people  want an organization of this county  into a stake, which I think they aught  to have.  But the great majority of the  faithful Saints think there is not a man  in the ward that the people will unite  upon to preside over them. It appears  nescessary for a man to be sent fram  abroad of decission and firmness to  preside over this stake if it ever  prospers as a branch of the Church of  Later Day Saints.  It is reported that Abram  Hatch the President af the Stake wants  his brother Jeremiah now bishop to be 
 $25,000 of other wealth, real estate, lends many houses in the city,  and this is an ensample of many of the Islatus nation. They allow  no white man or Mexiacan to mix with them in the blood; all their  marriages are in their own tribe. Our friend (Reylocero) said the  Americans had called them wild men. If they were wild, they were  honest and virtuous. It was very seldom that a case of seduction of  a wife or daughter was ever known in their tribes. Whenever such a  case did occur, the penalty of death was exedcuted and had been for  centuries, until civilization was introduced by Americans, who had  introduced seduction and corruption wherever they had a chance, and  now, if a man was put to death for seduction, the civilization of the  day would kill him. In fact, they were so much afraid of white men  coming kin contact with their women, that Brothers Tenney and Robert  H. Smith, of the 15th Ward, Salt Lake City, three years ago, came  near starving to death before they got thoroughly acquainted with  them, as they were not willing for them to go into the presence of  their women, but after the old patriarch had full confidence in  Brother Tenney, he put his granddaughter (a very handsome young woman)  in his charge, as he was going away for a season and a young Mexican  wished to court her, and the old gentleman did not wish him to marry  her. And, as the people in that village had full confidence in him,  on our arrival we were kindly received and entertained by all we  called upon. I look upon the Islatus as the most industrious and  hard laboring people of any I ever met with (tehe Latter-day Saints  not excepted). This Nephite village has a field of corn ten miles  in length and one in width, laying north and south fof their village,  all irrigated, and the corn quite as good as any I ever saw in Utah,  and perfectly clean; not a weed could be found in a hundred axcres. 
 by the Lord and his Holy Priesthood, and I shall certainly  not do it; for both earth and hell are full of that spirit  already, without any help from me, and I certainly  do not feel disposed to aid them in the matter.    Now, brethren, I have expressed myself in plainness;  but I trust in a proper spirit, upon this subject; Fta-  king all these things into consideration. If you  will tell me what your will is concerning this sub-  ject, I will endeavor to carry it out to the best of my  ability.

Presidents, bishops,  and people seemed to engage in the undertaking with  an earnest, zealous purpose, until another letter from  the Presidency was received, which expressed a desire  that the subject should not be urged upon the brethren  as a missionary duty, but be presented as a vol-  unteer service. This also was attended to with great  caution, and the call was repeated in person and by  letter to each of the presidents of the Stakes, and seve-  ral of the priesthood meetings were attended, in all  of which the views of the First Presidency were most  carefully communicated.    From that time it seemed as if the call  lost its hold upon the minds of the people as a  duty or obligation.

 Pres Geo. Please write him a good letter from the  general news in which we all join with our best respects  his letter did not reach us until after the conference  was over. [ Joseph Fielding Smith ]    Sept 9th 1885.    President John Taylor and Geo. Q. Cannon,    Dear Brethren,    I understand from   letters from Salt Lake City, that Mrs. A. S. B. Jennings,  who is now in Salt Lake City, is applying for the  Post Mastership of Salt Lake City. I have been requested  to recommend her to Hon. John T. Caine. I will say  that I have formed a very favorable acquaintance  with her at the Muddy and at St. George. I believe  her to be a true friend to the Peoples Party in Utah.  she has proved a friend to our people at the Muddy,  and wherever she has dwelt among them, and I   think it would prove a blessing to the majority  of the Citizens of Utah, if she could obtain the  office. I believe she has the ability to manage  and magnify the office, and she is indorsed by  politicians as a staunch Democrat, which may be  of some influence with them.

 It looks as though it would  Require a great Deal of care  now for the presidency to  preserve themselves from  the Hands of theire Enemies  in S. L.

 They have also twenty-one vineyards bordering on their city and 1000  vines to each vineyard, some of them 60 years of age, all kept per-  fectly clean and loaded with the finest of fruit, and as heavy a crop  as I ever saw in St. Geotrge, and the vines stand from two to four feet  in height and, in the fall of the year, each vine has a mound of  earth formed around it, until it is covered out of sight. In the   spring it is covered and the earth leveled. This is an immense  work. They have also many apple, pear and peach orchards, all ripe  as well as the grapes. Islatus is only occupied by the Nephites  themselves. No Mexicans or white men. The houses generally are  made of adobie, dcement or concrete, and plastered, the outside walls  as white as snow, and the floors made of mortar or plaster, very  smooth and many of them very neatly carpeted, and we saw some as  handsome women and girls as could be found in America, with the ex-  ception of color. There is one practice that exceeds any civilized  city on the bglobe that I ever heard of; there is no man, woman or  child allowed to sweep a particle of dirt or dust from their floors  into the door yards or streets, under the penalty of a fine. It all  has to be gathered in cloths or baskets and carried to mounds which  are located in different parts of the city. The room we occupied  was in the center of the town and the mound formed from the sweepings  of the floors in that part of the town measured 150 yards at the base  and some thirty feet high, which had probably been 100 years in col-  lecting, for they did not appear to cart it waway. I found in Is-  latus and in other villages of the Nephites the same kind of crockery  and stone ware painted in all its brilliant colors that we find the  remnants of in their ancient cities or ruins of the ancient inhab-  itants. All of their water jugs and main crockery are of this mat-

I am satisfied  that He is permitting this present Raid upon the  Latter Day Saints for a wise purpose. But it is  all in fulfillment of the revelations of God through  the Mouth of Ancient and modern prophets. Our  Nation is determined to get ripe in thir iniquity  Their never was a Nation ripening faster and  they must fulfill ther Destiny. The same wave  that Engulphed the Jaredites & Nephites will over-  whelm this Nation or one Like it. They will make war  upon the Saints untill their Cup is full. Again  Zion has got to be cleansed The Saints have got to be  purified and united, and my opinion is we shall be  affflicted untill it is done. It is not for me to say  how long it will take. It has seemed to me  of Late that there was a wave of Evil passing over th  whole Church & Kingdom of God like a wave of the sea  to temp men to do Evil.  Men that have been strong  for years give way to Adultey & pollution, and sacrifice  salvation to gratify the Lord of the flish, while these things  remains Zion will be afflicted untill she is purified  I have been pained to hear the reports of Events  passing among us. But Zion will mo be moved    2    out of her place. God has Decreed it. He will  ^contend with Zion &^ plead with her strong ones untill she is purifed  and overcomes and clean before the Lord.  The Zion  Church, and Kingdom of God must stand, prevail, conquer  & overcome while the wicked must be destroyed, and  Babylon fall.  The Lord will not fail concerning his  promises I am satisfied that great Judgments await  our Nation, and afflictions begins at the House of God.  I think it is vary signifficant that the first  Earthquake that has done Damage in North America  for a century should begin at Charleston where  the rebellion commenced See D&C. section 121. x 23. 24. 25 v  The word of the Lord should comfort us and sustain us  in all our afflictions.

Salt Lake City, Utah 188    Just as it was when several had sold out and were  ready to go to St. John, it seemed as if they thought  the Presidency came to their relief and released them  from a too rigid requirement made upon them  by the Twelve.    Moreover, a report got into circulation that  while President Hammond was calling for voters  to colonize San Juan County and hold the county  offices in the hands of the people, he had settled out-  side the county and indeed outside the Territory,   having located at Mancos, in Colorado, some  eighty miles from Bluff City, if I recollect aright.  Whether this be true or not, it is having a dama-  ging effect, and it strengthens the purpose of those  who have concluded to take their own choice and  stay at home. So that we only know of five persons  who have reported themselves ready to go to San  Juan settlement. They are from Sevier Stake, 
 5  to the offices of the last election, and  Bro. Davis told me to day that this  Johnson has reported that F M Lyman  John Henry Smith both promised him  that if he would be baptizsed they would  make him president of this Stake. I  have more confidence in these two  men than to believe any sutch report  he is an enemy to this people, and I  believe would sell us all far a few dollars  a piece. The same Johnson has married  Bro. Davise's Daughter which I suppose  is one cause of his being in favor of  him I have received reports from both  parties, and I can see that the division  is universahl and growing continualy  wider and more bitter. Every bishop in  the ward feels that bishop Hatch and  councillor Davi's course in electing an  outsider and a bitter enemy is entirely  wrong as I do myself. I told Bro. Davis I  thought very strange that he and bishop  Hatch should have united with the  outside element to elect a man outside  of the church and of his character for  a selectman. It is said there is a petition  in circulation to the Presidency of the Church  to have bishop Hatch elected President of this  Stake. But I do not think that he is a man

We commenced our business  and soon several Members of the Legislature  came in to consult upon some business  they were in ingaged in, and in the midst  of it, we were informed that the Gardo Home  and Historians office, was surrounded  with Marshals of course this Ended  our consultation and business.

President Taylor,    Dear Brother,    I write to say that  Brothers McAllister and Bleak were making  preparations to go to attend the Logan Conference.  As exposure was so great on the railroad they  were preparing to go by team; this going and re-  turning would make a journey of 900 miles.  This decision was taken upon the ground that  counsel was given last year for all the Presidents  of Stakes to attend the Semi Annual Conferences  I reflected upon this subject, and my mind was  exercised upon it and the Spirit did not dictate  to me that it was wisdom for them to go, and I  told them so. The same authority that gave them  counsel at that time to attend, has since given  them and us all counsel to keep out of the  hands of our enemies; and I feel satisfied  that with the exposure to which they are subject that they  could not go through the country to Logan and return  without getting into trouble as all the railroad  trains and stations are guarded from here to Logan.  Bro. McA. has got half of his family in Salt Lake and  the rest here, and he got word last night from there, from

 W. Woodruff  Jan. 30, 1884    Salt Lake City, Jany. 30, 1884.    President John Taylor,    Dear Sir—We are now getting at our  labors, contemplated in the appointment of   Brother F. D. Richards as Assistant Historian  and Recorder to the Church.    Commencing, as our work does, with the  death of President B. Young, in August, 1877,  the devolvement of the Presidency of the Church  upon the Twelve Apostles, with President John  Taylor as the President of that Council, is the  important fact that presents itself almost at the  very outset of our work.    The character and importance of this sub-  ject is such to all the Church, and to yourself  in particular, that in our judgment you are  the most fitting, and perhaps the only proper,  person to deal competently with the subject,   and so elaborate it as to place the facts on   record that will set the question of jurisdiction  of the Council, and of yourself as President of

Box 321    Salt Lake City, Utah, 188    with that decision of characture  that a man shauld possess who  presides over this Stake; for his infuence  is with those who are against the  interest of the Church. This Johnson is a  brother to Johnson whoe's wife shot  a man in Bearlake. I do not think him  a friend to the Saints of God. Bishop  Hatch is a good hearted man, and I think  means to do what is wright, but he is  easily influenced, and I think his influence  is on the wrong side at present. Of cours  I am ^not^ in a situation to attend their  conferences or teach in public, but I  am satisfied with what I have learned  from the various parties that there will  never be any union or prosperity with this  people, until there ^is^ some man sent from  abroad with firmness and decision of  character who will act upon the principle  of rightousness in presiding over this  Stake of Zion. I am in the enjoyment  of usual health and good Spirites, and  Still know that God reigns, and will

I knew  I had to take some desperate step, it I was saved  at all. Brother Seymour B Young And Alonzo  Hyde each drive drove up in a buggy near  the front, but Marshals Evry side of them. As  I was about to stetp out of the door to try  my chance Brother Jenson stept in with  his glasses on it came to me likes a   flash go out with Brother Jenson I said  Brother Jenson I want you to walk with me to  the other Office I put on my glasses & walked  walked out with him (And if you will pardon  my simiplicity) (Using [FIGURE] word I prayed the Lord if  He was willing to do any thing for me in this worl[d] He would do it now) 
 erial, for they still hold the art of making and painting. We vis-  ited quite a number of the fzamilies at the village and were kindly  entertained. Among others, we visited Mrs. Pascual Avieta, a Neph-  ite lady, I should judge 50 years of age, a large portly woman, with  a large, fine home; floors neatly carpeted, settees covered with  Navajoe blankets, wiorth $15 each. She was neatly dressed. I was  introduced to her by Brother Tenney and her daughters and sons. She  received me and treated me with all the elegance that any refined  lady could, and presided over her household with all the dignity and  grace of a Martha Washington. When her daughters were introduced  to me, after bowing and shaking hands, they very reservedly and  modestly retired across the room, sat down upon a settee and listened  to what was said in silence. The matron sat down beside me and con-  versed with great fereedom. While the family could speak good Span-  ish, her son, a fine young man of 20, could speak good English, which  was a God send to me, and I thoroughly improved it by preaching the  Gospel of Christ and blessings of the kingdom of God to him, which  he gladly received and promised to deliver the same to his father and  mother. The matron invited us into her pear, peach and apple or-  chard and grape vineyard which were ripe, and we feasted to our sat-  isfaction, and we repeated by invitation the same ceremony each day  while in Islatus. The feast was on the 27th of August. There were  hundreds of Mexicans from all the surrounding country gathered. The  Mexican women and girls, with their long trails. Most all the drink-  ing, gambling and figthting, which lastied all night, were done by the  Mexicans, while the Islatus were in their homes and doors locked at  an early hour. The Governor and leading men of Mosita Negra, where  we preached, were with us and did not take part with the Mexican 
 I heard a rumour yesterday  that the Governor of Chihuahua  had ordered all the Mormons to  leave that state in 15 days, and that  they charged them $6 for each 100 lb of  flour brought new to the line. I suppose  you probably have cent information  upon the Matter, if that is the case  what would you advise the Brothers  there to do, esspecially Wm Russel [FIGURE] G. T.  I am writing him to day. I sent him  a draft to sign of $25 on provo bank  Money due on shares. I thought if they  had to come back into Arizona it  would be well for him to stay with  Joseph H. Richards at St. George, untill  some other arangements could be made,  in Richards assisted him to his present  place of abode, such men ought to  be laboring somewhere. I have thought  that such Men as Lot & Jesse N Smith  might buy out some 2 or 3 Gentiles in the  upper Muddy in Nevada which would    controll all the watter of that settlement.  They wanted to sell very much when I was  there, so far all our people has had the  privilege of voting or holding office  without any question to ther religion  but how long that order of things will  last I cannot say. It is said the  Mill of the Gods grind slow, but sure  The Mill of the Devils grinds by fist fast  in these Mountains, but not always safe  They now have an Idea that they are  now going to destroy the Saints, but  they have one difficulty in ther way, and  that is the Lord, they may  indict  convict & fine him, but they cannot  imprision him. Their is no doubt  but what He will pay them, but not in  the coin they wish for, for God holds  the keys of power, Death, & Hell, and neither  the ring nor our Government has any  controll over him or his power. I don't  know that I have any council to give the  Presidency of the Church, without it is the council 
 a reliable source not to come up and expose him-  self. The same party wished us to get word to you,  not to give your enemies any chance; but I was  satisfied that you would be kept advised of all  things necessary for your protection.    I wish it distinctly understood that I do not wish to  interefere with any counsel given by the Presidency of  the Church, but in this case, I did not think you would  approve of it yourself and I have told them so; and  they are acting upon it and are going to stop; and if  there is anything wrong about it, I wish to take the res-  ponsibility upon myself and not them. I have acted  upon the best judgment I possess in the matter. They  themselves felt they were running great risks, especially  McA., but they wished to obey counsel.    Brother David H Cannon thinks he can go in safety,  and I think is calculating to go to represent the Stake.  I do not know whether Erastus is calculating to go  or not. I have enjoyed good health and spirits  with the exception, I am just getting over an attack  of the Epizootic, or distemper of some kind that has   been going through this Southern country, and which has  meade me nearly sick for a week; but I am all right at pre-  sent. I visited Bunkerville and the Muddy settlements and  held meetings with them and installed a Bishop at   Overton on the Muddy. Our brethren are resettling that  country again. The land is very rich and abundance  of water. When our brethren were there before they  put out a good many cottonwood cuttings, which  now make forests of timber over two feet through. I have  never seen timber grow so fast in any country.    We are kept acquainted of the exertions made by our enemies  to entrap our leading men and their families, and they have the  prayers of all Israel. I was made acquainted with your meeting  with the Apostles, which I heartily endourse and will hold to the compact  That the protection of the Almighty and the power and spirit of  God may be with you and family and coucillors is the daily prayer  of your brother in the Gospel    Lewis Allen

("On the evening  of the 14th I received your letter, and  according to your request, I started for  St. John in pursuit of the object this morn-  ing about 9 o'clock. I have signed my  name to a bargain; thus buying the  entire right of water, ditch, and land,  (except 2 1/2 acres situated upon the  east side of the river, in the edge of  the town:) Commencing at the bridge—  (including the bridge)—and running  down the River, for the sum of (750)—   Seven hundred and fifty head of cows;    I thought I would stay at the Spring until  the 25th. I went to bed at 10 o'clock, awoke at  12 with my mind deeply exercised; and  my monitor said to me; "aArise tarry not  at this place. Go to Sunset. Direct Bro Tenney  to close this [illegible] and secure the Meadows  without delay, for the enemy is on the alert."  So I awoke awoke my messenger who brought  me the letter. We made our fire, got our  breakfast and took our carriage and drove  40 miles to Sunset, over a rough rocky  country a part of the way. We arrived  about 7 o'clock. I counselled with Lot  Smith, and yesterday I wrote a letter to  Ammon M. Tenney to go immediately  and close this bargain, and secure the  2 1/2 acres if possible. Buy out the whole place  if possible; so that the Jews or Gentiles should  not have a hold among them. And this  morning we sent 4 men, fitted out as  missionaries from Sunset and Brigham  City and have called for one from Saint   Joseph and 4 from Snow Flake to join  them and go direct to Bro. Greer's—who is on  the meadows, and to get all they can to

 carousal.    Thus, dear broethren, I have given you an outline, merely, of the  field of labor which I consider the God of Israel has opened unto us  and which I consider the revelations of God require us to pefrform. I  think there is element sufficient for forty good, faithful Elders to  be employed to convert them to the Gospel of Christ and quite a good  number of missionaries called at the October Conference who can speak  the Spanish langyuage, or who will be able to learn it. I have al-  ready sent Brother Taylor a small list of names, including the In-  dian missionaries that are already in this country, as far as a I can  remember them, and if there are any in St. George or soutthehern Utah,  or northern, who can speak the Spanish, or who will learn it, I woudld  like Brother Taylor to have them by the October Conference.    I am happy to be able to state that most of the settlers I have  visited of the Saints have been blessed with fair crops of grain,  notwithstanding the dry season. They were just finishing threshing  as I left Snowflake. They will have over 3000 bushels of grain,  mostly wheat, and I am confiedent they will have over 4000 bushels of  Wheat at Sunset.    I have not written anything for publication concerning my journ-  eying to Lamanites or Nephites of late, thinking it would not be wis-  dom to publish anything about our labors among the American Indians  under the present state of excitement on Mormonism. I forwarded a  list of names in my other communication, as missionaries. I forward  a few more in this communication and those I send from here are most-  ly persons who have given in their names and willing to engage in the  mission. There were some incidents occurred on our mission which  were interesting to me and showed that the Lord was at work with and

We had full houses  and spirited teachings, whilst upon  our journey. I met in council this  afternoon with brothers Snow, Teas-  dale, McAllister and Eyring, and   have carefully selected a list of   names, which we forward for your  consideration. I have trusted more  to the judgment of brothers Snow  McAllister and Eyring in many  of the names, than my own, be-  cause they were acquainted with  them. We have endeavored as far  as we could in safety to add the  Bishops of the various wards to our  number. Please scan the list of  names and if approved telegraph  "consent." As the brethren in this list  will mostly be in to conference please  telegraph so that I can notify them  Brother Lyman, we expect, will  be with us on Saturday. All

Bartlett the  Tithing Office clerk & they gave me a  general history of the political and  temporal situatian of the whole Ashley  Ward and the trouble lies in this  that Bishop Hatch and his first councillor  Nathan Davis claim the wright to   govern, controll and dictate all political  conventions, caucuses & to get up the  list of nominations & control the  elections, and the influence of bro's  Hatch and Davis is with Lycurgus Johnson  who is Davi's son-in-law, and it is  said he runs the county, controls the  county funds which he manages to put  a good share in his own pocket  And they are intending at the next  election to leave aut Bishop Glines  as Probate Judge and put in Davis  who is with Johnson and the outside  element and are so managing the card  as to deprive the Saints from holding 
 three and four miles long respectively, and 10 feet  wide on the bottom are nearly completed.    Rexburg is only a little over one year old and  it is surprising to see what a vast amount of  labor has been done in such a short time,  considering, of course, the limited number of men  engaged in the work. There are about 1500 in-  habitants in the Bannock Stake and Rexburg  is the only place that has a ward organization  the other settlements, 10 in number, are presided  over by Priests, all of the settlements are rapidly  increasing. Prest Ricks feels that some of the  settlements are suffering for want of farther organi-  zation and thinks that a High Council would  greatly assist him in his labors. As we asked  for no instructions, not knowing the situation  while at home, we shall be pleased to know if it  is your wish for us to fully organize this stake.    Please answer by return of mail, addressing  us at this place care of Prest Thos E.

 The History of Joseph Smith contains no  account that we find of Orson Pratt's being cut  off from the Church by his Quorum. But in  the History of Brigham Young, in the "Millen-  nial Star," vol. 26, page 151, is the account of  the labors of the brethren of the Quorum with him,  and of the ordination of Amasa Lyman in his   stead, which is also quoted in the pamphlet  on Marriage and Succession, pages 19 and 20.    In the "M. Star," Vol. 20, page 423, is given  a full account of his baptism, confirmation, and  restoration to his former standing and apostleship,  in which account the prophet Joseph says, "I told  the Council that, as there was not a quorum pre-  sent when Orson Pratt's case came up before them,  he was still a member, that he had not been cut  off legally, and I would find some other place for  Amasa Lyman, to which the Council agreed."  This occurred on the 20th of Jan., 1843.    Orson Hyde was sustained and published  as President of the Twelve Apostles until and at  the April Conference, 1875.    It was at the October Conference, 1875, that 
 As soon as I passed into the clerks office I felt  like shouting Glory Hallalulah But I ownly said  thank God. I walked though the office into  the upper story of the Lion House. I was there  met by Brother Seymour B Young, Hyde & several  other Brethren who conducted me through  onto the East side North of the Eagle gate I  there got into Brother Youngs Buggy, & He soon  took me over the Hill east to a safe place  where I got some Dinner & staid untill  Dark when Brother Hyde took me to my place  of abode. As soon as I passed into the  clerks office I was filled with anxiety  for the safety of Brother Snow for I knew  He had No time to Escape as I had, for  as I came out of the Office door & went  though the Gate Greenman was coming  up on the side walke with the squad  of Marshal who had ben searching the  Tithing office I could not have come  out if I had been one Minute Later  I knew it Required about as Great a miracle  to save Brother Snow as it did me, and  my anxiety was vary Great untill I heard 
 running from 2 to 6 years old; to be paid  within one year. I have 3 weeks to decide  and^or^ notify them that I cannot accept.  Thus giving you time to express to me.    Now, you may think this a big price, and  so it is, but just as sure as you loose this  chance, or let it go a while longer, you will  just so sure have to pay 250 more cows;  and it will continue to rise. What is the sum   of 750 head of dows, when we are blessed with  the cattle upon a thousand hills, compared  to a home for two hundred large families  and probably more? How ever it is in the  hands of the Priesthood. They would take other  stock of purchasers at fair prices. If I had  them I could turn out 40 yoke of oxen to-day,  but probably not tomorrow.    (Round Valley is a little east of South of St. John)    It will be well to proceed immediately to take  up the Meadows; if no other way, send men  from the settlements. I mean more than I  say; for it is very urgent, you may depend upon  it. If it was me directing as you are I would  not let day-light nor dark make any difference  and while I speak of this, I will say that if  there is any Mormons that could be spared    it would be well to send them immediately here  to take possession; as nine points in the Law  is to have peacable possession, for I tell you  before-hand, that when this purchase is known  it will make one of the greatest excitements  that ever was here, as it will break up  merchants and at least 100 families, who  have built, and are depending upon rent-  ing from the Barths Brothers.    My well in the new Meadow is 65 feet  deep to water, which is inexhaustable.  I have expended $2000 there, and was  going to move my family there in two  weeks, but if you deem it wisdom for  me to move here to St. John, without unloading  I will do so, as it will be wisdom for some  one to be here.").    Now Brother Taylor, all of the foregoing is  from his letter, which will give you a little  insight into the affair. I got his letter at  about 8 o'clock in the evening. I had been  traveling through the snow all day. I had  been two days getting 10 miles, with heavy  loaded teams, and was calculating to make  it a rendesvous at the Spring.

This is  about the way it looks to me from  the testimony I get. Again, Brother  Bartlett the Tithing Clerk says: "there  has never been any settlement by any  one of Bishop Hatch Tithing affairs  or with myself as Clerk during the  time that I have officiated in that  capacity which has been for several years  All who have called upon me as Church  or Bishop's agents, have merely looked  at the wheat or what was on hand  but never have looked at the books  or asked for or made any settlement,"  which I think aught to be done by  some one    WW 
 W Woodruff.  St John purchase &c  Dec 26 [18]79    Sunset Apache Co Dec 12th 1879    Prest. John Taylor    Dear Brother,    I write to say a messenger has just arrived  from Colorado Meadows with a letter from Bro  Tenney informing me that we have secured the purchase  of all of St Johns except one water claim and 2 1/2 acres  of land. Our purchase secures to us 3 water ditches  all the land both sides of the river, and the town inc-  luding the toll bridge. We got this purchase for 700  Cows to be paid in one year, from two to six years  old. We have also taken possession of the Colorado  Meadows, I think some 25 or 30 claims entered and  we are the first on record to secure the water of the  Little Colorado to water 4480 acres of the land of this  Meadow. We were none too soon in securing this meadow  for our claims to the water and the possession of the  land had only just been obtained before the  Mexicans came to enter the water and secure and take  possession, and they were very much astonished to find    and have the Bishop at Johnson get some teams to go  to Upper Kanab and get the lumber that is sawed for  that boat and have it carried to the ferry or have  the boat made in the Settlements and carried down  on wheels. It seems to be absolutely necessary that  something should be done. I cannot do anything  about it while I am here, and again they want me  to go to St Johns and the Meadows to assist about  the settling of the country there.

 John Taylor was first presented as President of   the Quorum.    We have not the precise date of the meeting  at Mount Pleasant, in Sanpete County, at which  President B. Young made the statement that "when  I am not present, John Taylor presides over the  Twelve or this Council." Was it on the trip that  President Young and others made to Sanpete  between June 19 and 29, 1875? Perhaps you  have the date of this ready to hand, or fresh  in your memory.    Jan. 16, 1836, the Prophet Joseph said,  "The Twelve are not subject to any other than  the First Presidency," &c., "and where I am  not, there is no First Presidency over the Twelve."

 take up claims, so as to secure the Meadows  before the inhabitants of St. John know any  thing about it. Our missionaries are now on  the way with my letter to Bro. Tenney.    Now, Brother Taylor, what I wish to re-  quest concerning this matter is this;  That the companies who are being organized  to come to take possession of St. John and to  locate the Meadows will not delay, but come  this fall. And, again, you will see from   Bro. Tenney's letter, that according to the  contract he is to pay 750 head of cows  from 2 to 6 years old. Now, we have got to  depend a good deal upon the Brethren  who come from Utah, to bring this kind  of stock with them. So I wish you would  instruct Bros Rockwood and Vancott to see  that these companies are well supplied with  surplus cows—enough to pay for the purchase  of St. John. And, again, stock is the best  property for our emigration to bring to this  country, as stock, I  think is higher here  than in Utah. At the present time, of course,  our emigration should bring what farming  tools and provisions they need, until they    W Woodruff  Purchase of St Johns  Dec 1879

But I have already lenghtthened out  this communication much further than I intended at the commencement.  I learned of the release of the Apostles from prison from the "News,"  which has given joy to all the faithful Saints of the land. The  devil is making a hard struggle to stop the building of Temples and  the work of God, and the wicked are helping him, but, brethren, God  reigns and will stand by you to the end. The lawyers, judges and  nation^s^ are hastening to their doom as fast as time will permit and  as sure as fate.

 they were too late. We are coninually sending men out  of our settlements to take and hold possession until we  can get the emmigration of our people to ^take^ possession  I understand there is a large emmigration of both  man and beast of our people on the road, and as fast  as they arrive and have no appointed destination I am  counseling them to go to St Johns until we can get enou  gh to take care of the place.    I have been suffering for a few days with a severe  cold upon the lungs until it was leading to the Congestion  of the lungs. My throat and lungs became so sore and  raw that I could scarcely swallow or raise anything  and what I did raise was like fresh blood. I was using  dry sulphur and other things but appeared to do me no  good and as the matter was becoming somewhat serious  w^i^th one and while thinking of what I should do the  thought came to me to try pulverized charcoal. I imme-  diately had some prepared and I dropped near a teaspoon-  ful of it dry into my throat, and soon drank a table-  spoonful of it in some warm water and it relieved  me immediately. it stopped the soreness and bleeding  of throat and lungs and in 24 hours I was all right  again except somewhat hoarse. The reason why I am  particular about making this statement is, I would  recommend a trial of the same in case of that fatal  disease the Diphtheria. I do not see why it would not  have a good effect in such cases as well as in adults of  sore throat and lungs they are both near the same  nature    Bro Flake has just arrived to-day from Beaver  with a herd of stock on his way home to Snow Flake.  He has been to purchase stock to finish paying for  his purchase of Snow Flake. He says he has good suc-  cess but has lost stock on the way some, as nearly all  emmigration is doing the feed is so scarce on the way.

He  gave me to understand that Brother Ridges  had not done any work during December  and but Little during November and  in fact no steady work on that Organ  hardly during any of the month that He  had charged the Church 8 dollars a day  and when He did work one third or one   half of the time ^was^ on chairs, desks and

 raise, if they can: as bread-stuff is as high  again here as it is there. I should like to  be informed, as soon as you receive this, what  the prospect is about the companies, and   what the chance will be about their bringing  cows with them. We can begin to feel and  see the importance of the counsel and views  of President Young, years ago concerning this  country, and he often said; "Bretheren, form  your settlements in Arizona ^and^ New Mexico,  for the day will come, when you will want a  home there; and the time will come when  many will be glad to find friends in  Arizona." That day has already come, and  we have got to occupy this country, and  there is plenty of room; and the sooner some  emigrate ^from Utah^ the better. St. John is the hot-bed  and Carthage of this county; and I feel  it very important that we secure it.    I do not know as I have any thing more to  say upon this subject, at present. I received  word from Brother Brigham Young that he  thought he would visit us in Arizona soon,  with some other bretheren from the North. We shall  be glad to receive them; and all would be glad to  receive Bro Taylor, in this Country, if the journey    was not too long, and his business would per-  mit; or any others of the council    If Brother Brigham should want a day's hunt  to rest him, I could take him, in a day's drive  where he could see antelope in flocks like sheep  I saw 300 on Saturday in going 2 miles—  a hundred in a flock.

John Taylor    Dear Brother    In company with Bro Lot Smith I left Sunset  on the 24th of December, and attended the Quarterly  conference at Snow-Flake on the 27th and 28th and then  went to our missionary camp on the Meadows and to  St. John to see the state of things, and to assist the  brethren about the settling of the St John purchase  and we found two difficulties in our path. First  the Mexicans had destroyed in their ignorance nearly  all of the Government Survey stakes and Boundaries  (thinking that if the stakes were destroyed they would not have  to pay for the land). This made it quite difficult for  the brethren who had taken up claims on the Mead-  ows to find any lines so as to tell where to build.  And on our return to St Joseph I engaged Major Ladd  to go to the brethren at the Meadows and St John  and try to run out the lines. And the other difficulty  is the want of men to hold the claims at the Meadows  and take possession of the land we have purchased  at St John. We need 100 men ^at St John^ alone, while there is  room for 200. While at the same time our mission-

St George  June 243 [18]85  [end of sideways text]    June 16, [18]85    President John Taylor,    Dear Brother,    I feel like  writing a few lines to you this morning. I have  felt for a few days like breaking out of my prison house  some here in St George. I met in council with E. Snow  and the presidency of the St George stake, on friday night. I  felt a desire to attend the quarterly conference and con[si]der-  ded to do so, but as the U. S. Marshall Armstrong and  Clerk of the Commissioner at Beaver was expecting to attend  conference on both days; I concluded not to go untill  sunday. So I attended the Bishops Meeting in the morning  at 9 oclock upon the subject of trying to collect means  for the firnishing finishing of the Manti Temple  All the Bishops promised to do all thy could to acompli-  sh it. At 10 oclock I went into the stand, and I dont  know that there would have been much more su^r^prise if  a man had risen from the Dead & gone there; for although I had  been 3 1/2 months in St George very few persons knew that I was in  the county, as I had ownly privately met with some of the  prayer circles. In the Afternoon I had the privilege of speaking  to a full house including the U. S. Officers. I did not  hesitate to speak plainly and bear my testimony of our  mission to the world, and our responsibility to God and  our fellow men in the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus  Christ, and when Nations and rulers passed laws against the  Laws & Commandments of God it was better to obey God rather  than man. I felt free in my spirit Brother Snow spoke in the forenoon  At the Close of the meeting I passed out by the Marshal who conversed

John Taylor    Dear Brother,    We were served with a notice this morning by  letters from the United States Land Office at Prescott  to cease cutting timber on the public lands and to  settle for what had been cut. And we herein send  you a copy of the letters that you may see our position  in the matter    Prescott A.T.  Dec 10th 1879    Wm C. McLellan Esq.    Superindendant Saw Mill Brigham City    Sir: Pursuant to instructions of the  Hon. Comr Genl Land Office bearing date  of Nov 13th a copy of which is herewith transmitted  you are hereby notified to cease trespassing upon the  Public Timber Lands and furnish this office  with information as to the amount of Timber  taken time and place verifying the same under  oath    Very Respectfully  Your obedient Servant  William R. Kelly  Register    hands. We have no U.S. Statutes in this Settlement  upon the subject. If stumpage has to be paid how  much a thousand feet. I can not believe that our  Government as foolish as they are in some things have  left the Laws so that nobody can cut timber for  domestic use, yet we wish to know what the Law is  and would like you to tell us what we can lawfully  do and what not in the matter. Of course by prosecuting  us they can make us trouble but we wish to escape  trouble as far as possible. We do not wish to answer  the Commissioner before we get your answer, so  we would like an answer as soon as possible.    We are starting some more Missionaries   for the Meadows this morning    Since writing the foregoing we have examined  the Deseret News No 4 of Feb 26th 1879 on timber and  stumpage and if our timber that we are cutting are  declared not mineral Lands and we and all our  people have to pay triple for all timber cut and  imprisonment one year or even $500 fine and six  months imprisonment it becomes a very serious matter

Woodruff  Sunset Apache Co Arizona Nov 7, 1879  Nov 7 [18]79    President John Taylor    Dear Brother    Your welcome  letter of Oct 24 Is before me. I wrote  to Brother Snow yesterday and also to  Brother Tenney asking him to see what  He obtains the Main water & land of that  place for. A Jew by the Name of Barth  owns it or has the sale of it. Br Tenney  bought it last season. Most of the water  and land engaged it for $8000 dollars  but He had no backing at the time none  to help pay for it and He gave it up  It should be bought by some one before  a company goes there or that they know a  company is intending to buy it, for in  the case thy understood that, they would  want to Double the price Br Tenney being  well acquainted with the parties is the  Most suitable man in my judgement to make 
 other Labor for president Youngs family  I felt it my Duty to name this and   I do not think it just to acknowledge   his claims I think one half of his  charges should be taken from his Account  during the past year and then we would  pay vary Dear for the work done. I   think he ought to ^be^ dismissed from  Labor upon that Organ or any Labor   for the Church. For I am satisfied in   my own Mind that He is vary dishonest  in his charges and I would Rather do  without music then to heir such  a man. Besides I think we have  men that can do all that is necessary  upon that Organ    Your Brother in the Gospel    W. Woodruff

Box 321,  Salt Lake City, Utah, Jan 20, 1887    President John Taylor   Dear Brother    I recieved   your letter of Dec 16. But have not answered  it before for I have not had anything of   importance to lay before you. But there is   a few things I would like to say this mor-  ning First I will say I have made satisfa-  ctory arangements with the party spoken   of in your Letter M. H. Again I receiv-  ed a letter last Evening from A. M. Tenney   in which he asks several questions I can   do no better than to enclose his Letter to you   And if you give your consent to the adition   He asks for And if that part of the Temple   work is blocked up in Utah could it be atten-  ded to in Arizona or Mexico by some proper   Authority We have been looking for years  for our Nation to take their turn in   striking a blow against the Church and   Kingdom of God the same as Towns counties    & states here done, and this in fulfillment  of Ancient & modern prophets. And it seems   that we have lived to see that day. We have no   reason to expect anything Els but when the

 aries at the meadows are holding from 3 to 4  claims each. We have but few men at St John as yet  I am turning in the emigration as far as I can those  that I can get to go there but a good deal of the  emigration have other places designated to go. I appoi-  nted Bro. R. Allred to assist Bro Tenney in delivering  out the land to the emigration as they come. I also  appointed or recommended Bro. Allred to take charge  of the meetings until the place gets settled so that it  can be more fully organized. Of course all that country  comes under Bro Jesse N. Smiths jurisdiction in his  stake. I think Bro Nail of Toquerville will take up  his farm there but will have to get a Ranche out  side for his large amount of stock as will all men with  large herds, as it is not suitable for large herds to dwell  in any settlement of this country, for there is good facil-  ities throughout the country outside of farming district  We cannot tell what amount of land there is in the  purhcase at St John, it may amount to 2000 acres  it may vary from $5, 6 to 7 an acre besides the  Government title it may not go above $5.    One Mexican Brother joins us on our lower line which  he throws into the company and takes his share of land  and water with the rest. We also bought out two Mex-  ican claims joining our Mexican Brothers claim  down the river with two houses, 320 acres of land for  9 cows, so we have an unbroken claim from the Dam  down the river on both sides nearly to the Meadows  with the exception of two Mexican claims below us  and when we left one or both of theirm were talking of  being baptized, but there is one thing I wish to name  concerning our purchase. I supposed it included  the houses of the Mexicans. I now understand it  includes the land they stand on but the Mexicans  claim the houses. The Jews permitted them to build  on the land and they now claim them, but they are  poor, low, one story mud houses mostly. We have  several of the houses standing on the farming land  The two brother missionaries from Ogden occupy  two of them with their famiflies. I am now turning all  to St John that I can but as yet we do not begin to  have enough but shall do the best we can
