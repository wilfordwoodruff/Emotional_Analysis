Hon. Wiford Woodruff, City.  Dear Sir:  I have had many inquiries from the east regarding the healthfullness of this Territory, and I wish to prepare a few statistics to send to future inquirers, and would be pleased if you would have your proper office furnish me the following information, as soon as possible.  What is the aproximate number of persons in this city, who have been in the Territory for many years, or as I would say of the Pioneers, who are over the age of 75 years.  Your church historian must be able to give with little trouble a very close estimate of the number in your church in this city who are above that age. If convenient I would also like the same estimate of persons over the age of 80.  The object of obtaining these statistics is to make a comparison and show the percentage of the population over the above ages, as I am of the opinion that the percentage in this Territory will be much larger than any Stste or Territory can show, at least I have been asserting that there is a higher rate of longevity here than can be found elsewhere.
