 Extract from Letter of General Clarkson,  under date of Oct. 16, 1896.  I desire President Woodruff and his associates to know that I  cordially appreciate what they did in this matter in anticipating the  payment of their notes. I know of no others who in these contracting  financial times have been kind enough to anticipate their own paper. As  I said in my other letter, their action in this matter has greatly im- proved their credit in New York City. I could see it immediately at  the Plaza Bank, and Mr. Mills, the President, has spoken of it several  times to other bankers, and all of tyhem have said that they knew of no  other people or corporation who in these times, when money has become  the only thing of value, have anticipated the payment of their paper.  I  have given the impression that these notes were redeemed at $22,000, and  it is better to let that impression remain better for my credit, and  better for theirs. I wish you to assure Presidents Woodruff, Conrad  and Smith of my appreciation in this matter, and of my unrelinquished  desire to be of service to them and their people in any way that I can  in the future, personally, socially, politically, or in any other manner  in which my influence or help might be of any avail to them. I have  great faith in the problem they are working out. I have had constant  admiration for the manner in which your people have reclaimed the desert  and set up a great state in the wilderness, and as great admiration of  the humanity and kindness constantly displayed in your religion. Espec- ially pleasing to me is that portionof your church work and intention  which seeks to care for your people in this world as well as the next.  The industry uyou inculcate, the honesty you teach, the law and order you  observe, the ambition you have to serve your fellow men, are all very  appealing and influential with me, and the time will never come when I  will not be glad to serve your people or your Church in any way in which  my influence may fall to their benefit. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff addressed  the school, synopsis of which is given.  He was much pleased with the answer- ing of the questions.  the History of the  church had been compiled consider- able from his journal, he wrote the ser- mons and prophecies, he heard from  the Prophet Joseph Smith, and had  kept a record of the travels &c of Zions  Camp. When he was a boy he read  the testament and bible and wished  that he could see a prophet of God, he  would have walked 1000 miles, and  done anything in his power, to accomplish  that object, he used to pray to the Lord in  secreat to grant him this desire, and the  Lord gave him a promise, that he should  see prophets. he had spent 45 years of  his life in labors with prophets and  apostles, and he with them would soon  pass away, and then the boys before him  would have to step forward as Apostles  Elders and Bishops, now is the time  for you to qualify yourselves for these  positions, I believe many of you will  live to see the Savior come,  and not die 
 but be changed, learn to pray, kneel before  the Lord, if your parents do not pray, ask  them, tell them Brother Woodruff said so  get a testimony of the truth, study the  principles of the Gospel. You are forming a  character that will stick to you, not only  in this life, but that which is to come, tell  the truth always, and under all circum- stances, you are the only ones that are  taught righteous principles, we older per- sons were not taught correct principles we  were taught that God was a being without  body parts or passions, there is no such  being, God is a being like unto Bro Young and other good men, only he holds more  power and has greater knowledge.  Sabbath Schools is a good place for you  learn from the Bible and other good books.  we are living in the latter days, you have  Elders and Patriarchs to bless you, which  blessings are recorded, never quarrell, nor  contend, if you notice lambs, you will  see them play, but as soon as they are  likely, to hurt each other they stop, you do  likewise, I pray the Lord to bless you your teachers and parents. 
 Apostle Woodruff, spoke of the good effects  of Sabbath Schools & Mutual Improvement as- sociations, when he took a retrospective and  prospective look; he could see the good that  would be accomplished by the Young, there- fore he was interested in the welfare of both  Schools & Associations, advised the Young to  be careful in forming their characters from  8 to 18 as it would govern there after lives in  a great measure also their future destiny after  life. Counselled all to not spend their time  in reading novels, but to read the revelations  of God, felt a great interest in the Revelations  contained in the Doc & Cov, also the Bible &  Book Mormon, had spent the past 9 months  with ^a^ people living in the U.O. and had  not heard an oath or quarreling in that time  had not seen them drinking tea or Coffee or  spirituous liquors, nor chewing or smoking tobacco  exhorted the teachers to give good and  correct teachings to the boys and girls, and  they in turn give heed to the teachings given,  there was no greater field of labor than the  Sabbath School, and Mutual Improvement As- sociations. Death Was a seperation of friends  here, and a meeting on the other side of the  vail, births was a seperation in the spirit world  while it was a joy here. exhorted all to attend  their prayers & other duties. 
 [upside-down text] Please remember us  A very kindly to Mrs W. and all our friends. Should my & your friends ever come this way be sure they call on me. [end upside-down text]  Portland Nov. 9th [18]54  Brother Wilford  Your favor of Oct. 1st was recd. yesterday, we were sorry to hear of the illness of our friends, hope we may get letters from some of Mrs. [Fif's??] family by this Merit now [??] during the Summer your  letters came through very uniformly in 39 & 40 days, a very good trips considering the circum- stances. Our friends are all as well as usual. Mrs. Cantus health continues poor --  Father comes over to see us occasionally and seems to enjoy it very much matters re- main much the same at Secubus.  Dr Geo. Fubyam has recently gone to Boston to practice with very good prospects  Ezra and family are well, I didn't receive the paper you referred to in a late letter, recd. in some little time since printed in paper made in the valley  We have nothing new of interest, business in the States is very much depressed, by over trading, speculating, extravagant living &c.  The elections are taking place just now in many of the States and such a rebuke the Administration ever get before us the present one has, it came in with an overwhel- ming majority & is now sunk to the lowest depths of his grace 
 We are suffering severely from Small Pox in Portland, in many cities it is proving fatal   the Cholera is generally subsiding and has mostly disappeared throughout the county    I certainly desire to feel thankful that you have after so much trouble and per- plexity as you have had with Honor that you have at last succeeded in bringing it to so favorable a close. it has indeed been a sence of great perplexity to both of us and I think make the circumstances and  for the reasons you gave, that you took a very prudent cause in avoidng the law, for I think that in no other way could you have got so much out of it, and then there might have been in this year a tax expired before it could have been closed up. it appears that you have done all in the matter that it was possible for any one to have done and I think that but very few persons could have managed it so successfully as you have I really hope that this matter is now fully disposed of and that we shall now have something else to write about. As to forwarding funds I think that by Draft, in Government funds would be the safest way, it is a little
