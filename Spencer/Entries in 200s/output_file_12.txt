 and professing to be a most liberal free thinker,  spoke to the people very freely about one hour on  his particular views, his manner and style was  very unassuming, and affable; he was listened  to with great attention; and thoes present remarked  that he was one of the greatest reasoners they ever  heard. The free thinker was followed by John  S. Carter, who delivered a very elegant dis-  course on practical piety. Elder Joseph Young  spoke on the principles of free salvation, follow-  ed by Elder Brigham Young who set forth  baptism as nessary for salvation. After a  few moments resess, at two oclock P.M. the  trumpet again sounded, and a large  congregation from jacksonvill and surrounding  country appeared again in the grove, many  of whom expressed a desire to hear that metho-  dist man again. So I called Br. Joseph  Young into my tent, and told him to  preach an animated sermon on free grace, and  told him he should have the spirit. I then  went to Amasa Lyman, and said to him,  "I understand Mr. Lyman that you ar a  Prespetarian." "Yes" said he "I believe in that  doctrin" 'Well' said I, "I wish you whould  make a few remarks to the people on that subject,  after Mr. Young has done. I also sent for elder 
 Orson Pratt, and said to him, When these  brotherin get through speaking to the people  I wish you to make a few remarks reasoning  on the importance of a union of all the differant  sects, and denominations. These brotherin  complied with my request, and the cong-  gregation was also eddefied by elder Orson  Hyde on baptism for the remission of sins,  by Hiram Stratton exhorting the people to  obey the gospel, and Eleazar Miller gave a  powerful exortation. After the services of the  day were closed, many strangers made  remarks on the preaching they had heard,  they though[t] Joseph Young was a methodist  and were anxious he should stay in that  country and preach. They supposed Brigham  Young was a close communion baptist,  Orson Hyde a camblite, or reformed baptist,  Lyman E johnson a presbytarian, Amasa  Lyman Lyman a presbytarian, Orson Pratt  a universalest and inquired very carefully  if we all belonged to one denomination, the  brotherin replied some of us were meathodists,  some baptists, some campbelites, resirectionests ect,.  At the close of the meeting the sacrement was  administered and professing christians of  every denomination were invited to pertake, 
 Dr. Willams came down from Jacksonville with  the people, attended meeting and returned with  them. In the evening after supper, he left Jacksonville  and returned to camp, and reported that the  people universally (who had visited the camp)  expressed the highest satisfaction, with the treatment  and entertainment, and the good order that  prevailed in our midst, that one gentlemen said  he had vissited the camp, and presumed he  had questioned about one hundred of the  men, and had receieved polite answers to all  of his questions, but could not ascertain who  they were, where they were gowing, or what  were their business, and I believe them a fine  set of fellows or a pack of damn knaves and  I cannot tell for my life which. Another  intellagent gentlemen remarked that he did  not believe there was a collage in the United  States, that could turn out such an aloquent  set of preachers, as he had heard that day  in the camp. Dr. Willams said he had heard  hundred of such like remarks at Jacksonville,  and the most perfect good humor prevailed  throughout the town.  June 2, 1834 ~ Monday      Monday June 2nd,  We passed through Jacksonville, they undertook  to count us, and I heard one man say, 
 (who stood in the door of a cabnit shop) that  he had counted a little rising of five hundred  men, and he could not tell how many there  were. This thing was attempted many times  in villages and towns, as we passed through,  and the people were never able to ascertain our  number. We traveled twenty four miles, crossed  the Illioniois river at Phillips ferry and encamped  on the west bank. This morning we sent, brother  Luke Johnson to ascertain the feelings of the  people, and report to us, the country we passed  through was one of great scarsety though little  settled. Levi Hancock repeats what ^Joseph^ said, in our tent, "I want  you to remember what I say to you, the  Lord is gowing to give us dry weather now  till we get through, he has given us rain, that  we might have water on the prairie, you will  see the mercy of God in our favor all the way through  June 3, 1834 ~ Tuesday      Tuesday the 3rd.  Dureing our travels we visited sevral of the mounds  which had been thrown up by the ancient  inhabidants of this country, and this morning  I went up on a high mound near the river  accompanied by many of the brotherin. From  this mound we could over-look the tops of the  trees, and view the prairie on eather side of the 
 river, as far as our vision could extend, and the  scenery was truly delightful. On the tops of the  mounds were stones which personated the  apperance of three altars, one above the other, accord-  ing to the ancient order, and the remains of bones  were shown over the surface of the ground.  Wilford Woodruff says, "this mound was con-  sidered three hundred feet above the Illinois  river, we had a shovel and a hoe with us,  and while we were desending the mound, the  Prophet Joseph stopped suddenly and pointed  to the ground and said. "Brotherin dig in there."  And when we had dug one foot we uncovered the  skeleton of a man, which was entire, and in a  good state of perservation, and between his ribs  in the back bone was found the stone point  of a lamanitish arrow, whiched produced his  death. Milton Homes took the arrow out of  the back bone, also one of the thigh bones which  had been broken, and took it to camp, and  put it into my wagon; and at noon while  resting in camp, the Prophet Joseph, while  lying in his wagon, was rap[p]ed in vision,  and the history of this man whoes body we  discovered, was shown unto him. His name  was Zelph he was a white lamanite, a large  thick set man, and a man of God. The 
 curse had been taken from him because of his  righteousness. He was a warrior, and a chiefton  He fought under the prophet Onondagus, who  held domion from the east to the west sea includ-  ing the Rocky-mountains. Zelph had his thigh  bone broken from the sling of a stone, while  in battle, many years before his death. He  was killed in battle by the arrow found in  his back bone, dureing a great struggle  with the Lamenites, and I Wilford Woodruff,  carried the thigh bone to Clay County and  burried it in that country, I intended to  have burried it in Jackson County, thinking  that some prophet might have prophisied to him  that the members of Zions camp whould have  taken his bones with them to Zion and burried  them their, when they went up to redeem Zion;  But not having the privlage of gowing to  Jackson County, I buried it in Clay County.  The same day that we left this mound; at  noon while resting our teams and ourselves,  Brother Joseph called the camp togather, and after  giving them instructions, standing on a wagon  wheel, he prophesied unto the camp, and said  the Lord had proved to him, that there whould  be a scourage visit the camp in consiquince  of the fractious, and unruly spirit that 
 appeared among them, and they whould die  like sheep with the rot; still if they whould repent,  and humble themselves before the Lord, the  scourage in a great measure might be lessened,  but as the Lord lived this camp will suffer by  giving away to such unruly temper. This  speach affected every soul in camp, I do not  think there was a dry eye in camp. Joseph the  Prophet says, I had a conversation with Col.  Ross, (a wealthy gentleman in the neighborhood)  who gave us a flattering account of the country,  and wished to employ one hundred men for  which he proposed to make ready payment. He  wanted brick makers, builders ect etc. Our commisary  purchased twenty five gallons of honey at twenty  five cents a gallon, and a dozzen Missouri  cured hams, which proved to have been a little  improved on the out side; there not being enough  to supply one for every company; my company  agreed to do without; our supper consisted of  mush and honey, as we had been unable  to procure flour on account of the scarcity of  mills, after the fetagues of the day, it hardly  satisfied our hunger, but when we had quite  finished, some six of the hams were brought to  our tent door, and thrown down in anger  saying, "we dont eat stinking meat." I called 
 on brother Zebeda Colton, (our cook) and told  him to be quick and fry some ham, as  I had not had my hunger fairly appeased  for forty eight hours; he amediately commenced  cooking the ham, and for once my company  feasted to their full satisfaction. We had just  retired to rest, when the picket guard announced,  Luke Johnson. He came into our tent, and  made his report. He had visited a number  of influential men, among the rest a  baptist minister, who expressed great anxiety  that our company should be stopped, and  went to the Magistrate to inquire if there was  not some law or pretense for stopping us. He  (the priest) said to the Magistiate, that the com-  pany marched, and had guns like an army,  they pitched their tents by the side of the road; they  set out guards, and let no body pass into their  camp at night, and they are Mormons; and  I believe they are gowing to kill the people up in  Jackson County, Missouri, and retake their  lands. The Magistrate replied, "If you were  traveling, and did not want to put up at  public houses, or there was none in that country,  whould you not camp by the roadside in a tent;  and if you were afraid that your horses, or property  whould be stolen in a strange country; whould 
 you not watch, and keep guard." "Why yes," said  the priest, "but these are Mormons." "Well I cant  hear but they mind their own business, and if  you, and this stranger (meaning Luke Johnson)  will mind your own business, every thing  will be right." This baptist priest, treated brother  Luke Johnson with great politeness, gave him  his dinner; his wife washed his stockings, gave  him letters of interduction to men in Jackson  County, delivered to his charge some letters that  he had received from Jackson County, which brother  Luke brought into camp; he also stated that he had  seen a man that morning, who informed  him that four hundred men were in readiness,  on the Missouri side, at ten hours notice to use up  all the camp, and he was on his way to give them  notice a little before midnight. We heard sevral  guns fired, to the west of us, which appeared to be  answered by one directly east. There was no settle-  ment west of us nearer the state of Missouri, this  appearing so much like a signal, in addition  to the many threats of our being attacted on cross-  ing the Mississippi, I considered sufficant cause  of alarm to put out a double picket guard, and  place the camp in a state of defence, so that every  man might be ready at a moments notice; it  however proved to be a false alarm. 
 June 4, 1834 ~ Wednesday      Wednesday the 4th,  We crossed the large island which was about five  miles wide and encamped on the bank of the  Mississippi. We were short of provisions, having  little else but Indian meal; and no water  axcept the river, which we carried across the Mississippi.  Many of the company had the dispasition to  scatter in the woods for hunting, but I advised  them to the contrary. Some of the brotherin went  on to the sand bar, and got a quantity of turtles  eggs as they supposed, I told them they were  snake eggs, and they must not eat them, but  some of the brotherin thought they knew more than  I did about it, and still presisted in declairing that  they were turtles eggs, I said they were snakes eggs,  "eat snakes eggs will you, the man that eats them  will be sorry for it; you will be sick." Notwithstand-  ing all I said sevral brotherin did eat them and  were sick all the day after  June 5, 1834 ~ Thursday      Thursday the 5th.  We crossed the Mississippi river, which was a tedious  job, having but one small flat boat, and the river  being nearly one and a half miles wide; while  some were ferrying, others were engaged in hunting,  fishing &c. As we arrived we encamped on the bank  within the limits of Missouri. While at this place,  Sylvester Smith rebelled against the order of the 
 company, and gave vent to his feelings against  myself in particular in consequence growling  at him while he was marching the company up  to the camp, he being the last that came over  the river. The next morning I told them that  I whould desend to the spirit that was manifested  by some of the brotherin to let them see the folly of  their wickedness. I rose up and commenced speaking  by saying, "If any man insults me or abuses me  I will stand in my own defence, at the expense  of my life, and if a dog growls at me I will let  him know that I am his master." At this moment  Sylvester Smith who had just returned from here he  had just turned out his horses to feed, came up  and hearing me mak the remarks said, "If, that  dog bites me I will kill him." I turned to Sylvester  and said, "If you kill that dog I'll whip you." And  went on to show the brotherin how wicked and un-  christianlike such conduct appeared before the  eyes of truth and justice. (The elders in Clay County  wrote Governer Dunklin as follows) (if nessary to  insert in this history, this letter will be found in Book  A. No. 2 page 320.) from the Missouri Enquirer page  322 to 324)  June 6, 1834 ~ Friday      June the 6th,  We resumed our journey, and at night encamped  in a yard in a maple grove, near the creek. The 
 men who had previously followed, passed us sevral  times during the day, and were in search of us  this evening, the guards heard them say; ["]They have  turned aside dam 'em, we cant find 'em." Elders Seth  Johnson and A. M. Babbett who had been sent to  Bowling Green branch to gather recruits returned  to the camp on the morning of the 7th, with a  small company two wagons and sevral spare horses  June 7, 1834 ~ Saturday      Saturday the 7th,  One of the camp walked on ahead to procure some  milk; A number of men armed with guns met  him and said, "Here is one damed mormon alone  lets kill him," but at the same instant discovered a  number of others just coming over the hill, when they  immediately rode off in great haste. In the evening  encamped in a grove near a spring in Monroe  County where was a branch of the church known as  the Salt River church, and frequently called the  Akered settlement. Here we remained sevral days,  washing our clothes, and preparing to resume our  journey. Levi Hancock says, "while here I worked  on guns, I also made a flag staff and put on  it a white flag tipped with red and put it  on my wagon, and put on it an eagle, and  printed on it in large letters Peace; and as we went  through the settlements, many whould come, and  look at my flag and say peace, and walk off. 
 One night we camped in the middle of a prairie  without water; one man took a spade and said,  ["]Who knows but I can find water here." and dug  a small hole, which soon filled with good water;  when the brotherin saw this, they said it was as  much a miracle as for Moses to bring water out  of the rock  June 8, 1834 ~ Sunday      Sunday the 8th.  We were joined by my brother Hiram Smith  and Lyman Wight with another company, who  started from Pontiac, Michigan Ter. May the 5th,  the same day that we started from Kirtland, they  having passed through Ann Arber, Jacksonburg,  Spring Arbor, Constantine, Elkhart, crossed the  Illinois river one mile below Attawa, Pleasant  Grove, Pekin, Quincy, and Polmepa. Elijah Fordham  was their Historian, Lymon Wight Steward,  Hiram Smith, and Samual Bent Moderator. We  had agreed to meet at this point, and the first  that arrived was to wait for the other, and it was  a happy meeting. Soon after the arrival of brother  Hiram and his company, I dispatched brother  Luke Johnson and Almon W. Babbet with  messages to the brotherin in Clay County, fearing  that the letter which I sent from Springfield had  miscarried. James Alberd Sen. and ten others of  this branch of the Church joined our camp which 
 now numbered two hundred and five men, all  armed and equiped as the law directs; it was  delightful to see the companies, for they were all  young men, except one company whom we called  the Silver Grays, and who ate at my table. We  were all in good spirits, and were taught the  sworde exercise by brother Willam Cherry (who was a  native of Ireland) an expert drill master, who had  been in the British dragoon service for upwords of twenty  years, and deservs much credit for his unwearied  exertions ^in^ importing all he knew to the brotherin.  This was our first attempt at learning the sworde  exercise; brother Hiram Stratton and Nelson Tubbs  procured a shop of Myers Mabley, and repared  every firelock that was out of order in the camp,  and David Elliot shod our horses. Here brother  James Forster was taken sick, I proposed to him  to remain behind he said, "Brother Joseph let me  go with you if I die on the road." I told him  in the name of the Lord if that was his faith, to  go on his bed in the wagon and he whould  get better every day untill he recovered, which was  literally fulfilled. We reorganized the camp, I was  acknowledged the Commander-in-chief, Lyman  Wight General; I chose twenty men for my life guard  consisting of two companies, (my brother Hiram  was chosen captain of the first ten, and Roger Orton 
 captain of the second, and Gorge A. Smith my  armor bearer, F. G. Willams quarter master,  Z. Snow commissary, Nathan Tanner assistant,  Sylvester Smith adjutant, the remainder of the  camp was organized into companies of ten.  While at Salt River General Wight marsheled the  camp on the prairie and inspected our fire locks  ordered the discharge of the same at targets by plat-  toons, drilled us half a day, and about this   time I dispatched Elders Orson Hyde and Parley  P. Pratt to Jefferson City with a message to  Governer Dunken, to ascertain if he was ready to  fulfill the proposition which he had previously  made to the brotherin to reinstate them on their  lands in Jackson County, and leave them there  to defend themselves. June 4th Governer Dunken  wrote to W. W. Phelps and others, as follows; Mailed  at City of Jefferson 9th June 1835 [1834]. Herewith you  have a second order for the delivery of your arms now  in the possession of the Milita of Jackson County.  Col. Lucus has resigned his command he informs  me; If Lut. Col. Pitcher should be arrested before  you receive this, you will please hold up the order  untill I am informed who may be appointed  to the command of the regiment,  Respectfully,  Danial Dunken, 
 The foregoing letter endorced the following order  City of Jefferson June 4th 1834,    Thomas Pitcher, Lut. Col. Commandant,  of the 33rd Regiment,    Sir,  On the 2nd  day of last May I showed an order to Col.  Lucas to deliver the fifty two guns and one  pistol, which you received from the Mormons on  the 5th day of November last, and reported to him  on the 3rd day of the succeeding December to W.  W. Felps, E. Patridge, John Corrill, John Whitmer,  and A. L. Gilbert on their order; On the 24 ultimo  Col. Lucus wrote and informed me that he had  resigned his Commission, and left the County  of Jackson. You as Commandant of said regi-  ment are therefore commanded to collect the  said arms if they are not already in your posession,  and deliver them to the aforesaid gentlemen, on  their order.    Respectfully,  Danial Dunken,  Commander in Chief,    The following day Judge Ryland wrote the follo-  ing,    Richmond 10th June 1834,    Sir,   Deeply impressed with a desire 
 to do all in my power to settle or allay the  difficulties between the Mormons and the Citizens  of Jackson County. I have concluded that it  might have some tendency to affectuate this  object by having the Mormons called togather  at Liberty next Monday, and there explain to  them my notions and views of their present  situation, and of the circumstances attendant,  I therefore request you to use all your influence  with your brotherin to get them to meet me on  next Monday in Liberty. I much fear and  dread the consequences that are yet to ensue unless  I should succeed in my wishes to restore peace.  It is the duty of all good men to use all proper  and laudible means to establish peace. I expect a  deputation of some of the most respectable citizens  of Jackson County will meet me on Monday next  at Libert, I call upon you in the name of hu-  manity therefore to leave no effects untried to  collect your brotherin at Liberty as requested.  Should my efforts to make peace fail of suc-  cess there can at least be no wrong Sir in  the attempt, and I [s]hall enjoy the concelation  of having done my duty as a man as  well as a christian. I hope Sir, you will  duly appricate the motive which prompts  me to address this letter to you, and will 
 aid me with all your influence with your  brotherin in the prosecution of an object so much  to be desired by all good men, and citizens,  Yours very respectfully,  John F. Ryland.  June 12, 1834 ~ Thursday      June 12th,  We left Salt River and traveled about fifteen  miles. The inhabitants manifested a great  respect for us, and many of them accompanied  us some distance on our journey. I instructed  the camp in the morning, that if a gun  was fired it whould be considered an alarm,  but in the course of the day while I was  a little ahead, I shot a squirel for brother  Foster, when several of the brotherin came running  up to see what was the matter. I told them brother  Foster was sick. I want you should pray for him.  June 13, 1834 ~ Friday      Friday 13th,  Elder Kimball's horses through the negligance of  the guard got loose and went back ten miles  with others; he persued them and brought them  back to camp. F. G. Willam and Roger  Orton received a very severe chastisement for  neglect of orders in not taking care of the teams  when in charge of the guards. The reproof  given to Roger Orten was more particularly  for suffering Elder Kimball to go back after the 
 horses, as he was one of my life guards, and it  belonged to Roger to see that the teams were  attended to, but as the team was Kimball's, and  he had taken the care of it all through, Ortons  still threw the care on him. The Silver grey company  numbering fourteen were attached to my mess  making it twenty eight in numbers.  June 14, 1834 ~ Saturday      Saturday 14  Brother Joseph Hancock and another of the brotherin  we're chased a considerable po[r]tion of the day by  four suspicious fellows on horsback armed with  guns, whom they attracted by traveling in the  brush and thickets where horsmen could not  ride; it was late when they returned to camp.  At night we encamped in an unsafe and un-  plesant situation, in a small ravine the  only place we could get water for some miles.  The country was a wild uninhabited region.  In answer to the Judge the Elders wrote    Hon. J. F. Rayland, Near Liberty, 14 June 1835^4^  Dear Sir,  Your communication  of the 9th I'nst, from Richmond, was duly  received, and at a public meeting of our society  this day its contents made known, our brotherin  unanimously rendered their thanks for the 
 laudible disposition manifested on your part  to effect peace between our society and the inhabitants  of Jackson County, and as many as can con-  veniently will be present on Monday next. Entertaining  some fears that your honor in his zeal for peace  might unwarily recommend a sale of our lands  in Jackson County we have thought it expedient  to give reasonable notice that no such proposition  could reasonable be consented to by our Society  we have not heard that it was the intention of  your honor to urge any such measure, but our  enemies in Jackson County have long been  trying to effect this object. In a letter from  the Governer he says "I have been requested to  advice the Mormons to sell out and move  away but beliving that it could have no good  effect, I have withheld my advice." We give  this quotation from the Governer's letter to  disprove the statement made in the Upper  Missouri Enquirer of last Wednsday, and  conclude by adding that home is home, and  we want possession of our homes from which  we have been wickedly expelled, and thoes  rights which belonge to us, as natural free-born  citizens of the United States.    We are respectfully your friends and servant,  A. S. Gilbert (Sect) John Corrill (Chair)  Chairman 
 The foregowing was inclosed in the following  letter to their Lawyers,    Gentlemen,  Will you be so good  as to read the inclosed then seal and hand to  the Judge. We have given him an early hint  fearing that he might be induced by the sol-  icitation of our enemies to prepare a sale of our  lands, which you well know whould be like  selling our children into slavery, and urging of  such a measure whould avail nothing unless to  produce an excitement against us in this country  as requested last Thursday. We hope you will  be present on Monday.    Your friends and servants,  John Corrill, A. S. Gilbert  June 15, 1834 ~ Sunday      Saturday [Sunday] 15th,  Traveled twelve miles, on the way Orson Hyde  and Parley P. Pratt returned to us from Jefferson  City, and reported that Governer Dunkin  refused to fulfill his promice to reinstate the  brotherin on their lands in Jackson County  on the grounds of impracticability. We crossed  the Chariton River at its mouth and encamped  on the west bank. Bishop Patridge came into the  camp from Clay County, we received much  information from him concerning the hostile 
 feeling and prejudice that exhisted against  us in Missouri in all quarters, but it gave  us great satisfaction to receive intellagence from  him of the union and good feelings that  prevailed among the brotherin; as we were in  perrils and threatened all the while we were  muched troubled to get provissions, and had  to live on corn meal principly, and was glad  to get that. Here Dean Gould was baptized  by Lyman Wight.  June 16, 1834 ~ Monday      Monday 16th,  Traveled too, ferried over, and encamped on  the bank of Grand River, the ferryman  intended charging seventeen dollars, the  brotherin said they whould not pay it,  but whould sooner make a raft and  ferry themselves over, he then agreed to take  them over for twelve dollars which we accepted.  This morning was exceedingly hot, no air  stirring, and traveling in the thick woods, a  thunder shower coming on, the brotherin caught  all the water they could on the brims of their  hats, and not catching enough to satisfy their  thirst, they drank out of horsetracks. Martin  Harris having boasted to the brotherin that  he could handle snakes with perfect safety,  While fooling with a blue snake with his 
 bare feet, he received a bite on his left foot, it  was communicated to me, and I took accasion  to reprove him, and exhorted the brotherin never  to trifle with the promises of God, I told them  it was presumption for any one to provoke  a serpant to bite him, but if a man of God,  was accidentaly bitten by a poisonous serpant  he might have faith or his brotherin might  have faith for him so that the Lord whould  hear his prayer, and he might be healed, but  when a man designedly provokes a serpant to  bite him the principle is the same as when a  man drinks deadly poison knowing it to be  such, in that case no man has claim on  the promises of God to be healed. The citizens of  Clay County (to the number of eight hundred  or a thousand among whom were the brotherin)  assembled at the Court-house in Liberty agree  ably to the request of Judge Rayland in his  letter of the 10th instant, where they met Judge Raynald  and a deputation from Jackson who presented  the following propositions of the people of Jackson  County to the Mormons,    The undersigned Committee being fully  authorized by the people of Jackson County,  hereby propose to the Mormons that they will 
 buy all the lands that the said Mormons  own in the County of Jackson and also  all the improvements which the said Mormons  had on any of the public lands in said  County of Jackson as they exhisted before the  first disturbance between the people of Jackson  and the Mormons, and for such as they have  made since. They further more propose that the  valuation of said land and improvements shall  be ascertained by three disintrested inhabitants to  be chosen and agreed to by both parties. They  further propose that should the parties disagree  in the choice of arbitraters then ; ; ; ; is to choose  them. They further more propose that twelve  of the Mormons shall go along with the arbi-  trators to show them the land and improvements  while valueing the same, and such others of  the Mormons as the arbitrators shall want to  do so to give them information, and the people  of Jackson County garentee their entire safety  while doeing so, they further propose that  when the arbitraters report the value of the land  and improvements as afore said, the people of  Jackson County will pay the valuation with  one hundred percent added thereon, to the  Mormons within thirty days thereafter. They further  propose that the Mormons are not to make 
 any effort [e]verafter to settle either collectively or  individually within the limits of Jackson  County. The Mormons are to enter into bonds  to insure the conveyances of their lands in Jackson  County according to the above terms when the  payment shall be made and the committee  will enter into a like bond with such security  as may be deemed sufficient for the payment  of the money according to the above prepositions.  While the arbitrators are investigating and  deciding upon the matters preposed to  them, the Mormons are not to attempt to  enter Jackson County or to settle there except  such as are by the foregoing prepositions  permitted to go there. They further propose  that the people of Jackson County will sell all  their lands and improvements on public  lands in Jackson County to the Mormons  the valuation to be obtained in the same  manner the same percent in addition to  be paid, and the time the money is to  be paid is the same as the above set forth  re◊◊◊◊◊eth in our proposition to buy. The  Mormons to give good security for the payment  of the money, and the undersigned will to  give security that the land will  to the Mormons. They further propose that all 
 parties are to remain — — — — as they are till  the payment is made at which time the people  of Jackson County will give possession. Sign◊◊◊  (Signed) Samual C. Owens, John Davis,  Thomas Jeffress, Richard Frestoe, Smallwood  Noland, Thomas Hayton Sen., Robert Rickman,  Thomas Campbell, Abraham Mc Clellon. On  presentation of the foregowing Samual C Owens  made a flaming war speech, and Genl Doniphan  replied on the side of peace. The Revd Mr. Riley, a  baptist, made a hot speech against the Mormons  and said the Mormons had lived long enough in  Clay County and they must either clear out, or  be cleared out. Turnham the Moderator of the Meeting  answered in a masterly manner saying, "Let us be  republicans, let us honor our Country and not  disgrace it like Jackson County, for Gods sake  dont disfranchise or drive away the Mormons, they  are better citizens than many of the old inhabitants"  General Doniphan exclaimed, "Thats a fact, and as  the Mormons have armed themselves if they dont  fight they are cowards, I love to hear that they  have brotherin comeing to their assistance, grater  love can no man show, than he who lays down  his life for his brotherin." At this critical instant,  the cocking of pistols, the jingle of insterments of death,  [blank] desperation, one motioned "adjourn" 
 another "go on", and in the midst of this awful  crisis a person bawled into to doors "a man stabbed"  the mass instantly rushed to the spot, in hopes,  as some said that one damed Mormon had got   killed, but as good luck whould have it, only one  Missourian had dirked another, (one Colbert a  blacksmith had stabbed one Males, who had  previously whipped one Mormon nearly to death  and boasted of having whipped many more.) the  wound was dangerous and as the Lord was there  it seemed as though the occurance was nessary  to brake up the meeting without further bloodshed  and give the Saints a chance to consult what  whould be most advisable in such a critical  instant, and they amediately penned the following  answer to the propositions from Jackson County,  presented by Owens &c.,    Gentlemen,  Your propositions for an  adjustment of the difficulties between the Citizens  of Jackson County, and the Mormons is before  us, and as explained in the Court House this day,  we are not authorised to say to you that our  brotherin will submit to your proposel, but we  agree to spread general notice, and call a meeting  of our people in all, the present week, and lay before 
 you an answer as soon as Saturday or Monday  next. We can say for ourselves and in behalf of  our brotherin that peace is what we desire, and what  we dispose to cultivate with all men, and to effect  peace we feel disposed to use all our influence as  far as it whould be required at our hands, as  free common citizens of the United States, and  as fears have been expressed that we designed to  commence hostilities against the inhabitants of  Jackson County, we have pledged ourselves to  them, and to the hospitable Citizens of Clay County  that we will not, neither had designed as a people  to commence hostilities against the afore said  Citizens of Jackson County, or any other people.  Our answer shall be handed to Judge Turnham  the Chairman of the Meeting even earlier than  the time before stated if possiable.    (Signed) W. W. Felps, A. S. Gilbert, Willam E.   Lettin, John Coarill, Isaace Morley.    NB. as we are informed that a large number  of our people are on their way removing to Jackson  County, we agree to use our influence amediately  to prevent said company from entering into  Jackson County untill you shall receive an  answer to the proposition afore named.  It may be thought at first view that the  mob committee made a fair proposition 
 to the Saints in offering to buy their lands at  one hundred percent in thirty days and offering  their's on the same terms, but when it is understood  that the mob held possession of a much larger quantity  of land than the Saints and that they only offered  thirty days for the payment having previously rob[b]ed  them of nearly every thing that they had, it whould  be readily seen that they were only making a sham  to cover their previous unlawful conduct, but the  tempest of an immediate conflict seemed to be checked  and the Jackson Mob to the number of about fifteen  with Samual E. Owens and James Campbell,  at their head started for Independance Jackson  County to raise an army sufficient to meet me  before I could get into Clay County. Campbell  swore as he adjusted his pistols in his holsters, "The  Eagles and Turkey buzzards shall eat my flesh if I  do not fire Joe Smith and his army so that their   skin will not hold shucks before two days are passed.  They went to the ferry and undertook to cross the  Missouri River after dark and the Angel of God  saw fit to sink the boat about the middle of the  river, and seven out of twelve that attempted to cross  were drowned. Thus suddenly and justly went  to their own place by water. Campbell was among  the missing he floated down the river some four or  five miles, and lodged upon a pile of drift wood 
 where the eagles, buzzards, ravens, crows and animals  ate his flesh from his bones, to fulfill his own  words, and left him a horriable looking skeleton  of God's vengeance which was discovered  about three weeks after by one Mr. Purtle.  Owens saved his life only after floating  four miles down stream where he lod-  ged upon an island, swam off to  shore, walked about daylight through  a field of settles, borrowed a mantle  from a woman to hide his shame  and slipped home rather shy of the  vengeance of God  June 17, 1834 ~ Tuesday      Tuesday 17th. At noon we crossed the  Wacondah; it being high we had to be  ferried over. We were informed here that  a party of men were gathering togeth-  er on the Missouri River with the in-  tention of attacking us that night. The  prairie ahead of us was twenty-three  miles long without any timber or pal-  atable wholesome water. Some of the  brethren wished to stop near the timber  and were about making arrangements  to pitch their tents. We had but little  provisions; I proposed to get some wood  and water to carry with us and go on 
 the prairie 8 or 10 miles. My brother Hy-  rum said he knew in the name of  the Lord that it was best to go on to  the prairie, and as he was my elder  brother, I thought best to heed his coun-  sel though some were murmuring in the  camp. We accordingly started. When Ly-  man Wight crossed the river he disap-  proved of our moving onto the prairie,  upon which Sylvester Smith placed him-  self in the road, turned back all that  he could by saying, "Are you following  your General, or some other man"? and  twenty staid behind with Lyman Wight.  We drove about 8 miles on the prairie  and encamped out of sight of timber.  The sun apparently went down and  rose again in the grass. Our company  had filled a couple of empty pow-  der kegs with water which tasted so  bad we could not drink it, and all  the water we had was out of a  slough filled with red living animals,  and was putrid. About eleven o'clock  Lyman Wight arrived with the company  that had remained with him. I  called them together and reproved them  for tarrying behind and not obeying 
 my counsel, and told Lyman Wight never  to do so again. He promised to stand  by me forever and never forsake me  again let the consequences be what it  would; but Sylvester Smith manifested  very refractory feelings.  June 18, 1834 ~ Wednesday      Wednesday 18th. As Hyrum Stratton and  his companions were taking up their  blankets this morning, they discovered  two prairie rattlesnakes quietly sleeping  under them which they carefully car-  ried out of the camp. This day my  health was so poor, I left the affairs  of the camp to the management of  Gen. Wight. Having no provisions, we  traveled seventeen miles before breakfast.  I rode in Elder Kimball's wagon. We  crossed a slough half a mile wide,  through which most of the brethren  were obliged to wade waist deep in  mud and water. Gen. Lyman Wight  who had travelled from Kirtland with-  out a stocking on his foot, carried Br.  Joseph Young through on his back. Our  breakfast consisted entirely of corn meal  mush, or hasty pudding; we had not  meal enough in our company to make  the mush of the consistence of good starch. 
 After our 10 o'clock breakfast we  passed on to within one mile of  Richmond. We encamped in a very  small prairie surrounded by a thicket  of hazel brush. When I arrived where  the camp had pitched their tents  and viewed our unsafe location con-  sidering the danger of an attack  from our enemies, I almost forgot  my sickness, went some distance in  the brush, bowed down and prayed  my heavenly father to suffer no evil  to come upon us, but keep us safely  through the night. I obtained an  assurance that we should be safe  until morning. Notwithstanding the  fact that about 50 of the Jackson  County mob crossed the Lemington Fer-  ry that evening for the purpose of  joining the Clay County mob and of  making an attack upon us, all  was quiet in the camp through the  night. While the brethren were mak-  ing their bed in Capt. Brigham Young's  tent, one of them discovered a very  musical rattle snake which they were  about to kill. Capt. Young told them  not to hurt it, but to carry it out of 
 the tent when Br. Carpenter took it  in his hands carried it beyond all  danger and left it to enjoy its liberty,  telling it not to return.  June 19, 1834 ~ Thursday      Thursday 19th. At daybreak feeling  that we were in a very unsafe   situation, I counselled the camp to  move forward without delay and con-  tinue a lively march for about nine  miles where we stopped for breakfast.  While passing through Richmond, Br.  Luke Johnson observed a black woman  in a gentleman's garden near the  road. She beckoned to him and  said, "Come here massa"; she was  evidently much agitated in her feelings.  He went up to the fence and she said  to him, "There is a company of men  laying in wait here who are calcula-  ting to kill you this morning as you  pass through.["] We halted for breakfast  on an eminance near a farm-house.  The owner furnished us with a large  quantity of milk which gave a great  relish to our bacon and corn dodger  which our company had purchased  that morning. When we asked the price  of his milk he replied, "He is a mean 
 man that will sell milk. I could  have let you had more if I had  known that you were coming"; and  he further said; "You have many ene-  mies about here and you may meet  with some trouble and it is a dam'd  shame that every man can't come  up and enjoy his religion and  everything else without being molested."  It was near noon when we fin-  ished our breakfast and we passed  on in fine spirits determined to go  through and meet the brethren in  Clay County. We travelled but a short  distance when one wagon broke down  and the wheels ran off from others  and there seemed to be many things to  hinder our progress although we strove  with all diligence to speed our way  forward. This evening we camped  on an elevated piece of land be-  tween Little Fishing and Big Fishing  Rivers which was(?) formed by seven  small streams or branches. As we hal-  ted and were making preparations  for the night, five men armed with  guns, two of whom had swords rode  into our camp and told us we should 
 "See hell enough before morning"; and  their accompanying oaths partook of  all the malice of demons. They  told us that sixty men were coming  from Richmond, Ray County, and  seventy more from Clay County to  join the Jackson County mob who  had sworn our utter destruction. The  weather was pleasant.    As Jazemiah B. Smith was taking  his bedding out of the wagon he  discovered a large rattle snake which  he had carried with him all day.    During the day the Jackson Co-  unty mob to the number of about  200 made arrangements to cross the  Missouri River above the mouth of  Fishing River at William's Ferry, into  Clay County and be ready to meet  the Richmond mob near Fishing  River ford for our utter destruction.  But after the first scow load of  about forty had been taken across  the river, the scow in returning was  met by a squall and had great  difficulty in reaching the Jackson  side by dark.    Wilford Woodruff states that "when 
 the five men entered our camp there  was not a cloud to be seen in  the whole heavens, but as the men  left the camp there was a small  black cloud appeared in the north-  west and it began to unroll itself  like a scroll and in a few min-  utes the whole heavens were covered  with a pall as black as ink. This  indicated a sudden storm which soon  broke upon us with wind, rain, thun-  der, lightning and hail. Our beds  were soon afloat and our tents blown  down over our heads. We all fled  into the Baptist Meeting House. As the  prophet Joseph came in shaking  the water from his hat and clothing  he said, "Boys, there is some mean-  ing in this—God is in the storm."  We sang praises to God and lay  all night on the benches under cover  while our enemies were in the pelting  storm. It was reported that the  mob cavalry who fled into the school-  house tried to hold their horses by the  bridles between the logs, but when  the heavy hail struck them, they all  broke away skinning the fingers of 
 those who held them. The horses fled  before the storm and were not found  for several days. It was reported  that the Captain of the company in  the school house said that it was a  d—d strange thing that they could  do nothing against the d—d Mormons  but what there must be a d—d hail  storm or some other d—d thing to  hinder them from doing anything.  But they did not feel disposed to  acknowledge that God was fighting  our battles."    The storm was tre-  mendous—wind and rain, hail and  thunder met them in great wrath and  soon softened their direful courage and  frustrated all their designs "to kill Joe  Smith and his army." Instead of  continuing firing, which they commenced,  they crowded under wagons, into hol-  low trees, filled one old shanty &c. and  when the storm was over their ammu-  nition was soaked; and the party in  Clay County were extremely anxious  in the morning to return to Jackson  having experienced the pitiless peltings  of the storm all night. And as soon   as arrangements could be made this 
 "forlorn hope" took the "back track" for  Independence to join the main body  of the mob, fully satisfied as were  the survivors of the company who  were drowned that when Jehovah fights,  they would rather be absent. The grati-  fication is too terrible.    Very little hail fell in our camp,  but from one half to one mile around  us the ^hail-^stones or lumps of ice cut down  the crops of corn and vegetation gen-  erally, even cutting limbs from trees  while the trees themselves were twisted  into withes by the wind. The light-  ning flashed incessantly which cau-  sed it to be so light in our camp  through the night that we could dis-  cern the most minute object. The roar-  ing of the thunder was tremendous.    The earth trembled and quaked,  the rain fell in torrents, and it  seemed as if the mandate of ven-  gence had gone forth from the God  of battles to protect his servants from  the destruction of their enemies, for  the hail fell on them and not on  us, and we suffered no harm ex-  cept the blowing down of some of 
 our tents and getting wet, while our  enemies had holes made in their  hats and otherwise received damage  such as the breaking of their rifle-  stocks and the fleeing of their horses  through fear and pain. Many of  my little band received shelter in an  old meeting house through this night.  In the morning the water in Big  Fishing River was about forty feet deep  where the previous evening it was no  more than to our ankles: and our  enemies swore that the water rose thirty  feet in thirty minutes in the Little Fish-  ing River.    They reported that one of their men  was killed by lightning, and that ano-  ther had his hand torn off by his  horse drawing his hand between the  logs of a corn crib while he was  holding him from the inside; and  they declared "If that was the way  God fought for the God damned Mor-  mons, they might as well go home  about their business."  June 20, 1834 ~ Friday      Friday 20th. This morning I coun-  selled the brethren to discharge all their  fire arms, when it was found we 
 had near six hundred shots, very few  of which missed fire, which shows how  very careful the brethren had been in  taking care of their arms during the  storm. We went five miles on the prai-  rie where we could procure food for  ourselves and horses, and defend our-  selves from the rage of our enemies.  June 21, 1834 ~ Saturday      While in this situation, on Saturday, 21st,  Col. Sconce with two other leading men  from Ray County came to see us desiring  to know what our intentions were; "for"  says he, "I see that there is an al-  mighty power that protects this people;  for I started from Richmond, Ray Coun-  ty, with a company of armed men  having a fixed determination to destroy  you; but was kept back by the storm  and was not able to reach you." When  he entered our camp he was seized with  such a trembling that he was obliged  to sit down to compose himself; and  when he had made known the ob-  ject of their visit, I arose and address-  ing them gave a relation of the suf-  ferings of the Saints in Jackson Coun-  ty, and also of our persecutions gener-  ally, and what we had suffered 
 by our enemies for our religion, and  that we had come one thousand  miles to assist our brethren to bring  them clothing, &c and to reinstate them  upon their own lands, and that we  had no intention to molest or injure  any people, but to administer to the  wants of our afflicted friends; and  that the evil reports circulated about  us were false and got up by our  enemies to procure our destruction.  When I had closed a lengthy speech  the spirit of which melted them into  compassion they arose and offered me  their hands and said they would  use their influence to allay the excite-  ment which every where prevailed aga-  inst us, and they wept when they  heard of our afflictions and perse-  cutions and that our intentions were  good. Accordingly they went forth  among the people and made unwear-  ied exertions to allay the excitement.    Bris. Ezra Thayre and Joseph Hancock   were ^(are)^ sick with the cholera. Thomas  Hays was taken sick today (this is  fulfillment of the prophecy given June  3rd). The brethren in Clay County wrote 
 the same day the following to the com-  mitte of the Jackson County mob.    Clay Co. 21st, June, 1834.  Gentlemen: —    Your propositions  of Monday last have been generally  made known to our people, and  we are instructed to inform you  that they cannot be acceeded to.    Honorable propositions to you are  now making on our part, and we  think we shall be enable to deliver the  same to you the early part of next  week.    We are happy to have it in our  power to give you assurances that  our brethren here together with those  who have arrived from the east are  unanimously disposed to make every  sacrifice for an honorable adjustment  of our differences that could be requir-  ed of free citizens of the United States.    Negotiations at the camp are now  going on between some gentlemen of  this county and our brethren, which  are calculated to allay the great  excitement in your county. We are  informed that the citizens of Jackson 
 entertain fears that our brethren in-  tend to invade their territory in a  hostile manner. We assure you that  their fears are groundless,—such is  not and never was our intention    Signid   W. W. Phelps  W. E. McLellian  A. S. Gilbert  John Corrill  Isaac Morley.    To S. C. Owen and others of the  Jackson Co. Committee." ^*2nd page 70 follows this^  June 22, 1834 ~ Sunday      Sunday 22nd. Br. Lyman Smith  received a wound from the accidental  discharge of a horse pistol from which  he recovered in about three days.  Cornelius Gillium, the sheriff of Clay  County, came to the camp to hold con-  sultation with us. I marched my  company into a grove near by and  formed in a circle, with Gillium in  the center. Gillium commenced by  saying that he had heard that  Joseph Smith was in the camp, and  if so he would like to see him. I  arose and replied, "I am the man"    This is the first time that I had 
 been discovered or made known to my  enemies since I left Kirtland. Gil-  lium then gave us some instructions  concerning the manners, customs, and  dispositions of the people &c and what  course we ought to pursue to secure  their favor and protection, making  certain inquiries to which we replied;  these were afterward published and will  appear under date of publication.    I received the following revelation  given on Fishing River Mo., June 22nd 1834.  ^See Rev. June 22nd 1834.^    1st Verily I say unto you who have   assembled yourselves together that you  may learn my will concerning the  redemption of mine afflicted people.    2 Behold I say unto you were it not  for the transgressions of my people, speak-  ing concerning the Church, and not in-  dividuals, they might have been redeem-  ed even now; but behold they have not  learned to be obedient to the things  which I require at their hands but are  full of all manner of evil and do  not impart of their substance, as becom-  eth Saints, to the poor and afflicted  among them, and are not united ac-  cording to the union required by law 
 of the Celestial Kingdom and Zion  cannot be built up.    Previous to crossing the Mississippi,  I had called the camp together and  told them that in consequence of the  disobedience of some, who had been  unwilling to listen to my words, but  had rebelled, God had decreed that  sickness should come upon the camp  and if they did not repent and hum-  ble themselves before God, they should  die like sheep with the rot; that I  was sorry but could not help it; the  scourge must come, repentance and  humility may mitigate the chastisement  but cannot altogether avert it, as there  were some who would not give heed  to my words.  June 23, 1834 ~ Monday      Monday June 23rd. ^For additional see Millennial Star Vol 157.86.^ During this day  a council of High Priests assembled in  fulfilment of the revelation given the  day previous and the following indi-  viduals were called and chosen as  they were made manifest unto me by  the voice of the spirit and revelation  to receive their endowments.    Edward Partridge was called and  chosen to go to Kirtland and re- 
 but he said he could not do it.    Peter Whitmer Jr., Simeon Carter, Newel  Knight, Parley P. Pratt, Christian Whit-  mer and Solomon Hancock were called  and chosen and it was appointed  unto them to receive their endowments  in Kirtland with power from on  high to assist in gathering up the  strength of the Lord's House, and to  preach the everlasting Gospel.    Thomas B. Marsh was called and  chosen; and it was appointed unto  him to receive his endowment in  Kirtland—his office to be made  known hereafter.    Lyman Wight was called and  chosen; and it was appointed unto  him to receive his endowments in  Kirtland with power from on high;  and to return to Zion and have  his office appointed unto him hereafter.    The same day the elders made  the following reply as before referred to,  to S. C. Owens and others, Committee  of the Jackson Mob.—    "We the undersigned committee  having full power and authority to  settle and adjust all matters and 
 differences existing between our people  or society and the inhabitants of Jackson  County upon honorable and constitutional  principles.    Therefore, if the said inhabitants of  Jackson County will not let us return to  our lands in peace, we are willing to  propose firstly:— That twelve disinterested  men, six to be chosen by our people and  six by the inhabitants of Jackson County,  and these twelve men shall say what  the sands [lands] of those men are worth in  that county who cannot consent to live  with us: and they shall receive their  money for the same in one year from  the time the treaty is made, and  none of our people shall enter the coun-  ty to reside till the money is paid.  The said twelve men shall have  power also to say what the damages  shall be for the injuries we have sus-  tained in the destruction of property and  in being driven from our possessions;  which amount of damages shall be  deducted from the amount for their lands.    Our object is peace, and an early  answer will be expected    (Signed) W. W. Phelps 
 Edward Partridge  John Corrill  Isaac Morley  John Whitmer  A. S. Gilbert  June 24, 1834 ~ Tuesday      June 24th. We resumed our march for  Liberty, Clay County by a circuitous  route around the head of Fishing  River, to avoid the deep water.    When within five or six miles of  Liberty we were met by Gen. Atchison  and other gentlemen who desired us not  to go to Liberty because the feelings of  the people were so much enraged against  us. At their solicitations we changed  our course, wheeled to the left and cross-  ing the prairie and woodland came  to Br. A. S. Gilbert's residence and  encamped on the bank of Rush Creek  in Br. Barker's field.    ^*^ This night the C^c^holera burst forth  upon us and about midnight it was  manifest in its most terrific form,—our  ears were saluted with cries and moan-  ings and lamentations on every hand.  Even those on guard fell to the earth  with their guns in their hands, so too—  sudden and powerful was the attack 
 of this terrible disease.    At the commencement I attempted  to lay on hands for their recovery  but I quickly learned by painful  experience that when the great Jehovah  decrees destruction upon any people  and makes known his determination,  man must not attempt to stay his  hand. The moment I attempted  to rebuke the disease, I was attacked;  it seized upon me like the talons of  a hawk, and I said to the brethren  if I had had my work done, you  would have had to tumble me into  the ground without a coffin; and had  I not desisted I must have saved the  life of my brother by the sacrifice of my  own.  June 25, 1834 ~ Wednesday      June 25th. Early this morning the camp  was separated into small bands and  dispersed among the brethren living in  the vicinity.    I wrote and sent by ex-  press to Messrs. Thornton, Doniphan, and  Atchison as follows:—    Rush Creek, Clay County,  June 25th, 1834.    Gentlemen:—  Our company of men 
 advanced yesterday from their encamp-  ment beyond Fishing River to Rush Creek,  where their tents are again pitched. But  feeling disposed to adopt every pacific  measure that can be done without  jeopardizing our lives, to quiet the pre-  judices and fears of some part of the  citizens of this county, we have conclu-  ded that our company shall be imme-  diately dispersed, and continue so till  every effort for an adjustment of dif-  ferences between us and the people of  Jackson has been made on our part,  that would in any wise be required  of us by disinterested men of republican  principles.    I am respectfully,  Your obedient servant,  Joseph Smith Jr.    N. B.—You are now corresponding with  the govenor, (as I am informed;) will  you do us the favor to acquaint him  of our efforts for a compromise. This in-  formation we want conveyed to the gove-  nor, inasmuch as his ears are stifled  with reports from Jackson, of our hostile  intentions, &c  J.S. 
 I left Rush Creek in company with  David Whitmer and two other brethren for  the western part of Clay County. While  traveling we called at the house of Mr.  Moss for a drink of water. The woman  of the house shouted from the door that  they had no water for Mormons—that  they were afraid of the Cholera &c; at  the same time throwing out her arms  as if defending herself from the cholera  in the form of a personage. We turned  and departed according to the command-  ment, and before a week had passed  the cholera entered that house and that  woman and three others of the family  were dead.    When the cholera made its appearance,  Elder John S. Carter was one of the first  who stepped forward to rebuke it, and  upon this was instantly seized, and be-  came the first victim in the camp. He  died about 6 o'clock in the afternoon; and  Seth Hitchcock died in about thirty min-  utes after. (and Erastus Rudd died about  the same moment although half a mile  distant; he was buried by Jesse Smith,  Geo. A. Smith and two or three others;  while burying him Jesse Smith was 
 attacked with the cholera.    As it was impossible to obtain cof-  fins, the brethren rolled the corpses in  blankets, carried them on a horse-sled  about half a mile, burrid them in the  bank of a small stream which empties  into Rush Creek, all of which was  accomplished by dark. When they had  returned from the burial, the brethren  united, covenanted and prayed, hop-  ing the disease would be staid; but  in vain, for while thus covenanting, Eber  Wilcox died; and while some were dig-  ging the grave, others stood sentry with  their fire arms, watching their enemies.  June 26, 1834 ~ Thursday      June 26th. The elders wrote govenor  Dunklin as follows:—    Sir,—  A company of our people  exceeding two hundred men arrived in this  county the 19th inst. and encamped about  twelve miles from Liberty, where they were  met by several gentlemen from this and  Ray County, who went by request of the  people to ascertain the motives and de-  signs of our people in approaching this  county; and as the deputation was com-  posed of gentlemen who appeared to 
 possess humane and republican feelings,  our people were rejoiced at the opportu-  nity of an interchange of feelings, and  an open and frank avowal of all  their views and intentions in emigra-  ting to this country with their arms. A  full explanation having been given in a  public address by our brother Joseph Smith  Jr., which produced great satisfaction, the  same in substance was afterwards re-  duced in writing, and handed to the  aforesaid gentlemen, that it might be  made public, as the shedding of blood  is, and ever has been, foreign and  revolting to our feelings. For this reason,  we have patiently endured the greatest  indignities that freemen of this republic  have ever been called to suffer; and  we still continue to bear with heart-rend-  ings a deprivation of our rights, have  commenced negociations with the inhab-  itants of Jackson for a compromise; where-  in proposals on our part have been  made, which have been acknowledged  by every disinterested man to be highly  honorable and liberal. An answer to  our propositions has not yet been re- 
 ceived from Jackson.    If we fail in this attempt, we  intend to make another effort and go  all lengths that would be required by  human or divine law. As our propo-  sals and correspondence with the inha-  bitants of Jackson, will doubtless hereafter  be published, we think it unnecessary to  detail the same in this communication.  Our right to our soil in Jackson County  we shall forever claim, and to obtain  peaceful possession we are willing to  make great sacrifices. To allay excite-  ment in the county, the aforesaid com-  pany of emigrants have dispersed to  await the final end of all negotia-  tions that can be made with the said  county of Jackson.    Within the last week one of our  men being near the ferry, was seized  by some Jackson citizens, while in this  county, threatened with death if he  made resistance, and carried over the  river, prisoner to Independence, where  he was put under guard one day,  and after hearing many threats, was  liberated. The houses of several of our 
 brethren in this county have been forci-  bly entered by some of the inhabitants  of Jackson, and a number of guns  and small arms taken therefrom. Where  the men were absent from their houses,  loaded guns were presented to the fe-  males, and their lives threatened if they  made resistance, and ^as^ we have been  informed, and have no doubt of the  fact.  [rest of page blank] 
 Your second order for the restoration of  our arms was received last mail; we have  not yet done any thing with it. Hoping  that the influence of the inhabitants of Jack-  son County will materially lessen in the  surrounding counties and the pepoople be-  come more tranquil, we think it wisdom  to defer petitioning for a guard while  there exists a hope of a compromise, &c.    We believe that the President would ren-  der us assistance in obtaining possession of  our lands if aided by the executive of this  Stakte in a petition, and thereby put an  end to serious evils that are growing  out of the Jackson outrage. In a letter from  your Excellency of April 20th, we had a word  on the subject of petitioning.    We should be pleased to hear further, and  would here observe that no communication  from the Executive, giving his opinion or ad-  vice, will be made public if requested not to  do so. We are Respectfully and with great  regard your Obt. Servants,    A. S. Gilbert,  W. W. Phelps.  John Corrill.    The drafting and signing of the above  was the last public act of that keeper of the 
 Lord's Store-House, Algernon S. Gilbert, for he  was attacked with the cholera the same day  and died about the 29th, according to his  own words, that he would rather die, than  go forth to preach the gospel to the gentiles.    The following is from the chairman of  the committee of the Jackson Mob to our Lawyer.    Independence, Mo. June 26th, 1834.    Mr. Amos Rees— Dear Sir:—  Since my return  from Liberty, I have been busily engaged  in conversing with the most influential men  of our county endeavoring to find out if  possible what kind of a compromise will  suit with the Mormons on their part. The people  here en masse I find out will do nothing  like acceeding to their last proposition. We will  have a meeting if possible on Monday next,  at which time the proposals of the Mormons  will be answered. In the mean time, I would  be glad that they, the Mormons would cast an  eye back of Clinton and see if that is not a   country calculated for them. Yours Respectfully,  S. C. Owens.    The cholera continued its ravages about  four days when a remedy for purging, vom-  iting and cramping was discovered; name-  ly: dipping the person afflicted in cold water 
 or pouring it upon them, and giving  them whiskey thickened with flour to the  consistence of starch. (Whiskey was the only  kind of spirits that could be procured at  this place). About sixty-eight of the saints  suffered from this disease, of which number  fourteen died, viz: John S. Carter, Eber Wilcox,  Seth Hitchcock, Erastus Rudd, Algernon Sidney  Gilbert, Alfred Jesse J. Smith, Warren Ingalls  Fisk, Edward Ives, Noah Johnson, Jesse B. Law-  son, Robert McDord, Elial Strong, Jesse J. Smith,  Warren Ingalls and Betsey Parrish. Among the  most active of those that were engaged in  taking care of the sick at the camp, burying  the dead, &c were John D. Parker, John Tanner,  Nathan Tanner, Joseph B. Nobles, Brigham Young,  Joseph Young, Heber C. Kimball, Luke Johnson,  and Eleazer Miller.    I sent Hiram Page with instructions to bring  Jesse J. Smith and Geo. A. Smith to me at all  hazards to the west part of the country, having  had intimations that they were sick, he found  that Jesse had been severely racked with the  cholera all day, Geo. A. Smith had taken care  of him for upwards of thirty hours. Dr. Wil-  liams decided that the cholera had left him  and would recover if not moved, on the  morning of the 28th, Geo. A. Smith was attack- 
 ed and was immediately mounted on a   hard riding horse, rode 15 miles and came  to me.    The last days of June I spent with my  old Jackson County friends in the western part  of Clay County.  July 1, 1834 ~ Tuesday      On the first of July Jesse J. Smith died. I  crossed the Missouri River in company with a   few friends into Jackson County, to set my  feet once more on the "goodly land;" and on  the 2nd I went down near Liberty and visited  the brethren. A considerable number of the  camp met me at Lyman Wight's. I told  them if they would humble themselves before  the Lord and covenant to keep His command-  ments, and obey my counsel, the plague should  be stayed from that hour and there should  not be another case of the cholera among  them. The brethren covenanted to that effect  and the plague was stayed. W. Woodruff  says, I was present at the meeting of Joseph  with his brethren at Lyman Wights and the  Prophet seemed more bowed down with sorrow  at the loss of his brethren than I ever saw  him in my life. At the same time he  was clothed with the Spirit of God and  with humility; and when all the Brethren 
 covenanted with uplifted hands to Heaven  that they would humble themselves the Lord  and keep his commandments and obey the  counsel of the Prophet, the power of God rested  upon them and we were all bathed in tears.  There was not another case of cholera among  the saints from that hour."    This day the "Enquirer" published the cor-  respondence between the Sheriff and the Camp,  of the 22nd of June, as follows:    "Being a citizen of Clay County and knowing  that there is considerable excitement amongst  the people thereof; and also knowing that  different reports are arriving almost hourly,  and being requested by the Hon. J. F. Ryland  to meet the Mormons under arms, and ob-  tain from the leaders thereof the correctness of  the various reports in circulation, the true in-  tent and meaning of their present movemen-  ts, and their views generally regarding the  difficulties existing between them and Jackson  County, I did in company with other gentle-  men call upon the said leaders of the  Mormons at their camp in Clay County,—and  now give to the people of Clay County their  written statement containing the substance of  what passed between us. (Signed) Cornelius Gillium. 
 Propositions &c of the Mormons.    Being called upon by the above named  gentlemen at our camp in Clay County to  ascertain from the leaders of our men, our  intentions, views and designs in approaching  this county in the manner that we have; we  therefore the more cheerfully comply with their  request because we are called upon by gentle-  men of good feelings and who are disposed  for peace and an amicable adjustment of  the difficulties existing between us and the  people of Jackson County. The reports of our  intentions are various and have gone abroad  in a light calculated to arouse the feelings  of almost every man. For instance, one re-  port is that we intend to demolish the prin-  ting office in Liberty: another report is that  we intend crossing the Missouri River on Sun-  day next, and falling upon women and  children and slaying them: another is  that our men were employed to perform  this expedition being taken from manufac-  turing establishments in the East that had  closed business: another^lso^ that we carried a  flag bearing peace on one side and war or  blood on the other: and various others too nu-  merous to mention, all of which a plain 
 declaration of our intentions from under our  own hands will show are not correct.    In the first place it is not our intention  to commit hostilities against any man or  set of men. It is not our intention to in-  jure any mans person or property except  in defending ourselves. Our flag has been  exhibited to the above gentlemen who will be  able to describe it. Our men were not taken  from any manufacturing establishment. It  is our intention go back upon our Lands  in Jackson County by order of the Executive of  the State, if possible. We have brought our  arms with us for the purpose of self defence, as  it is well known to almost every man of  the State that we have every reason to put  ourselves in an attitude of defence, consider-  ing the abuse we have suffered in Jackson  County. We are anxious for a settlement  of the difficulties existing between us upon hon-  orable and Constitutional principles.    We are willing for twelve disinterested  men, six to be chosen by each party, and  these men shall say what the possessions  of those men are worth who cannot live  with us in the County; and they shall have  their money in one year; and none of 
 the Mormons shall enter that county to re-  side until the money is paid. The damages  that we have sustained in consequence  of being driven away, shall also be left to  the above twelve men; or they may all live  in the county if they choose and we will  never molest them if they will let us alone  and permit us to enjoy our rights. We want  to live in peace with all men; and equal  rights is all we ask. We wish to become  permanent citizens of this state and wish to  bear our proportion in support of the govern-  ment and to be protected by its laws. If the  above propositions are complied with, we are  willing to give security on our part; and  we shall want the same of the people of  Jackson County for the performance of this  agreement. We do not wish to settle down in  a body except where we can purchase the  lands with money; for to take possession by  conquest, or the shedding of blood, is entirely  foreign to our feelings. The shedding of blood  we shall not be guilty of until all just  and honorable means among men prove  insufficient to restore peace. (Signed) Joseph Smith  Jr. F. G. Williams, Lyman Wight, Roger Orton,  Orson Hyde, John S. Carter, June 21st  (over) 
 To John Lincoln, Geo. R. Morehead }  John Sconce, James H. Long, James Collins }  July 3, 1834 ~ Thursday      On the 3rd of July the High Priests of Zion  assembled in the yard of Colonel Arthur's where  Lyman Wight lived, in Clay County, and I pro-  ceeded to organize a High Council agreeable to  the revelation and pattern given at Kirtland,  for the purpose of settling important business  that might come before them, which could  not be settled by the Bishop and his council.    David Whitmer was elected President and William  W. Phelps and John Whitmer assistant presidents.    The following High Priests namely, Christian  Whitmer, Newel Knight, Lyman Wight, Calvin  Beebe, William E. McLellin, Solomon Hancock,  Thomas B. Marsh, Simeon Carter, Parley P. Pratt,  Orson Pratt, John Murdock and Levi Jackman  were appointed counsellors and the Council ad-  journed to Monday. Frederick G. Williams was  clerk of the meeting.    I authorized General Lyman Wight to give  a discharge to every man of the camp who  had proved himself faithful, certifying that  fact, and giving him leave to return home.    From this time I continued to give instructions  to the members of the High Council, Elders, those 
 who had traveled in the Camp with me, and  such others as desired information, until the  7th when the Council assembled according to ad-  journment at the house of Elder Lyman Wight,  present fifteen High Priests, eight elders, four Priests,  eight Teachers, three deacons and - - members.  After singing and prayer, I gave the Council  such instructions in relation to their high cal-  ling, as would enable them to proceed to min-  ister in their office, agreeable to the pattern here-  tofore given; read the revelation on the subject,  and told them that if I should now be taken  away, I had accomplished the great work  the Lord had laid upon me, and that which  I had desired of the Lord; and that I had  done my duty in organizing the High Council,  through which council the will of the Lord might  be known on all important occasions, in the  building up of Zion, and establishing truth in  the earth.    It was voted that those who were appoin-  ted on the third, should be confirmed in their  appointments. I then ordained David Whitmer  President, and W. W. Phelps and John Whitmer  assistants; and their twelve counsellors. The twelve  counselors then proceeded to cast lots to know  who should speak first, and the order of speaking 
 which resulted as follows, namely:  Simeon Carter No. 1 Parley P. Pratt No. 2  William McLellin " 3 Calvin Beebe " 4  Levi Jackman " 5 Solomon Hancock " 6  Christian Whitmer " 7 Newel Knight " 8  Orson Pratt " 9 Lyman Wight " 10  Thomas B. Marsh " 11 John Murdock " 12    Father Whitmer came forward and blessed  his three sons, namely: David, John and Cristian  Whitmer in the name of the Lord. Also Father  Knight blessed his son Newel. Bishop Partridge  stated to the council, that a greater responsibi-  lity rested upon him than before their organi-  zation, as it was not his privilege to counsel  with any of them except the council and his  own counsellors, and desired their prayers  that he might be enabled to act in righteous-  ness. I next presented the case of W. W. Phelps  to the Council to have their decision whether  he should take his family to Kirtland, and  if so, when he shall start, as it had been  deemed necessary for him to assist in the prin-  ting establishment. It was motioned and  carried that four of the counsellors speak on  the subject, two on each side, namely; Sime-  on Carter and William E. McLellin for the Plain-  tiff; and Parley Pratt and Calvin Beebe for the 
 Church. After hearing the pleas, the President  decided that it was the duty of W. W. Phelps to  go to Kirtland to assist in printing and that  his family remain in the region where they were,  and that he have an honorable discharge from  his station in Zion for a season. (as soon as he  can accomplish his business) signed by the Pres-  ident and Clerk.    It was then proposed by W. W. Phelps that  David Whitmer, the President of the Church in Zion,  should go to Kirtland and assist in promoting  the cause of Christ, as being one of the three Wit-  nesses. This case was argued by Levi Jackman  and Christian Whitmer in behalf of the plain-  tiff, and Solomon Hancock and Newel Knight  for the Church; after which it was decided, as  before, that Brother David Whitmer go to the  East and assist in the great work of the gath-  ering, and be his own judge as to leaving  his family or taking them with him. It was  also decided that John Whitmer and William  E. McLellin go east as soon as convenient. The  High Priests, Elders, Priests, Teachers, Deacons and  members present then covenanted with hands  uplifted to Heaven, that they would uphold  Brother David Whitmer as President in Zion  in my absence, and John Whitmer and 
 W. W. Phelps as assistant presidents or coun-  sellors, and myself as first President of the  Church; and to uphold one another by faith  and prayer.    Previous to entering into this covenant, and  in pursuance of the revelation to the Saints to  sue for, and proclaim peace to the ends of the  earth, the following appeal was written and san-  ctioned by the High Council and first Presiden-  cy of the Church at the foregoing sitting. Presi-  dent Whitmer closed the Council by prayer. F.  G. Williams was clerk.    An Appeal.    Whereas the Church of Christ, recently styled the  Church - - - - - of the Latter-Day Saints con-  tumeliously called "Mormons" or "Mormonites" has  suffered many privations, afflictions, persecutions  and losses on account of the religious belief and  faith of its members, which belief and faith  are founded in the revealed word of God, as  recorded in the holy Bible, or the Book of Mormon,  the revelations and commandments of our  Savior Jesus Christ; and whereas the said church  by revelation commenced removing to the wes-  tern boundaries of the State of Missouri, where  lands were purchased of the government, and 
 where it was caluculated to purchase of those  who were unwilling to reside with the Church  as a society, all lands that could be bought for  the purpose of building up a holy city unto God,  a New Jerusalem — a place which we were desirous  to call Zion, as we believe a place of refuge  from the scourge and plagues which are so  often mentioned in the Bible by the prophets  and apostles, that should be poured out upon  the earth in the last days; and whereas the  inhabitants of Jackson County, Missouri, have  leagued and combined against said church,  and have driven the Saints from their lands,  and taken their arms from them, and burn-  ed down many of their houses without any  provocation; and whereas we have petitioned  the Governor of this State, and the President  of the United States for the redress of wrongs,  (the law being put at defiance in Jackson Coun-  ty) and for redemption of rights, that we  might be legally repossessed of our lands and  property: and whereas the said inhabitants of  Jackson County, have not only bound them-  selves to keep us out of that county, but have  armed themselves cap a pie and even with can-  non for war: and whereas our people resi-  ding in the upper Missouri, have recently armed 
 themselves for military duty and self defence,  seeing their arms taken from them by the in-  habitants of Jackson County were purposely kept  from them; and whereas a number of the  members of the Church in the east have emi-  grated to this region of country to settle and  join their Brethren, with arms to answer the  military law, which has created some excite-  ment among the inhabitants of the upper  counties of this State, whereupon to show that  our object was only the peaceable possession of  our rights and property, and to purchase  more land in the regions round about, we met  a committee from Jackson County for compromise;  and our emigrating brethren met some gentle-  men from Clay and other counties to satisfy  them that their motives were good and their  object peace, which they did. and whereas the  propositions of the Jackson Committee could not  be accepted on our part because they proposed  to "buy or sell" and to sell our land would  amount to a denial of our faith, as that  land is the place where the Zion of God shall  stand according to our faith and belief in  the revelations of God, and upon which Is-  rael shall be gathered according to the Prophets:  and secondly the propositions were unfair 
 not withstanding they offered double price for our  lands, in thirty days, or sell theirs at the  same rate; for this plain reason that the  whole large county of Jackson would be as  thirty to one, or nearly so, in comparison with  the matter in question and in supposition, for  one thousand dollars, two thousand dollars  to our people, was asking for three hundred  thousand dollars, the exhorbitant sum of six  hundred thousand dollars, taking the land  rich and poor, in thirty days! with the reproach-  able, vicious, unamerican and unconstitutional  proviso that the committee on our part bind  themselves "That no Mormon should ever settle  in Jackson County": and whereas our committee  proposed to the said Jackson Committee (if they  would not grant us our rights otherwise) that  our people would buy the land of those that  were unwilling to live among our people in  that county, and pay them in one year; they  allowing the damage we have sustained in  the loss of a printing office, apparatus and  book work, houses, property, &c to come out of  the purchase money, but no answer returned:  and whereas to show our honest intentions  and awaken the friends of virtue, human-  ity and equal rights, it becomes our duty 
 to lay our case before the world to be weighed  in the balances of public opinion.    Now, therefore, as citizens of the United  States and leading Elders in the Church of  the Latter-Day Saints residing in the state  of Missouri, in behalf of the Church we the  undersigned do make this solemn appeal  to the people and constituted authorities of  this nation and to the ends of the earth,  for Peace; that we may have the privilege  of enjoying our religious rights and immu-  nities and worship God according to the  dictates of our own consciences as guaran-  teed to every citizen by the constitutions of the  national and State governments. That although  the laws have been broken arend are defied  in Jackson County, we may be enabled to re-  gain and enjoy our rights and property agree-  able to law in this boasted land of liberty.    Since the disgraceful combination of the  inhabitants of Jackson County has set the  law at defiance and put all hopes of  criminal prosecution against them in that  vicinage beyond the reach of judge and  jury, and left us but a distant expectation  of civil remuneration for the great amount  of damage we have sustained, necessity 
 compels us to complain to the world. And if  our cause and calamity are not sufficient to  excite the commisseration of the humane, and  open the hearts of the generous, and fire the  spirits of the patriotic, then has sympathy  lost herself in the wilderness and justice fled  from power; then has the dignity of the ermine  shrunk at the gigantic front of a mob, and  the sacred mantle of freedom been caught up  to Heaven where the weary are at rest and the  wicked cannot come.    To be obedient to the commandments of our  Lord and Savior, some of the leaders of the  Church commenced purchasing lands in the  western boundaries of the State of Missouri ac-  cording to the revelations of God, for the city of  Zion: in doing which no law was evaded,  no rights infringed nor no principle of reli-  gion neglected but the laudable foundation of  a glorious work begun for the salvation of  mankind in the last days agreeable to our  faith and according to the promises in the  sacred Scriptures of God.    We verily bielieve, knowing that the Nation-  al and State Constitutions, and the statute  laws of the land and the commandments  of the Lord allowed all men to worship as they 
 pleased, that we should be protected, not only  by all the laws of a free Republic, but by  every republican throughout the realms of  freedom.    The holy prophets had declared, "That it  should come to pass in the last days that  the mountain of the Lord's House should be  established in the top of the mountains and  should be exalted above the hills, and all na-  tions should flow unto it. And many people  should go and say, come ye and let us go  up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house  of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of  his ways and we will walk in his paths;  for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and  the word of the Lord from Jerusalem." And  again it was said by Joel seemingly to  strengthen the faith of the Latter-Day Saints  in the above "That whosoever should call non  the name of the Lord, should be delivered, for  in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be de-  liverance as the Lord hath said, and in the  remnant whom the Lord shall call." The  Book of Mormon which we hold equally sa-  cred with the Bible, says "That a new Jerusa-  lem shall be built upon this land unto the  remnant of the seed of Joseph, for the which 
 things there has been a type." In fact, all  the prophets from Moses to John the Revelator,  have spoken concerning these things, and  in all good faith, by direct revelation from  the Lord, as in days of old, we commenced  the glorious work, that a holy city — a new  Jerusalem, even Zion might be built up, and  a temple reared in this generation, where-  unto, as saith the Lord, all nations should be  invited. Firstly the rich and the learned, the  wise and the noble; and after that cometh  the day of his power. But the inhabitants of  Jackson County arrayed themselves against  us because of our faith and belief and des-  troyed our printing establishment, to prevent  the spread of the work, and drove men wom-  en and children from their lands, houses  and homes, to perish in the approaching  winter, while every blast carried the wailings  of women and the shrieks of children across  the wide spread prairie, sufficiently horrible  to draw tears from the savage or melt a heart  of stone!    Now that the world may know that our  faith in the work and word of the Lord is  firm and unshaken, and to show all nations,  kindreds, tongues and people that our object 
 is good, for the good of all, we come before the  great family of mankind for peace and ask  their hospitality and assistance for our comfort  and the preservation of our persons and property,  and solicit their charity for the great cause  of gGod. We are well aware that many slan-  derous reports and ridiculous stories are in cir-  culation against our religion and society, but  as wise men will hear both sides, and then  judge, we sincerely hope and trust that the  still, small voice of truth, will be heard and our  great revelations read and candidly compared  with the prophecies of the Bible, that the great  cause of our redeemer may be supported by  a liberal share of public opinion as well as the  unseen power of God. It will be seen by a  reference to the Book of Commandments, page  135, that the Lord has said to the Church, and  we meant to live by his words, "Let no man  break the law of the land, for he that keepeth the  Laws of God, hath no need to break the laws  of the land;" therefore as the people of God, we come  before the world and claim protection by law from  the common officers of justice in every neighborhood  where our people may be; we claim the same  at the hands of the governors of the several States  and of the President of the United States, and of 
 the friends of humanity and justice in every  clime and country on the globe.    By the desperate acts of the inhabitants of  Jackson County, many hundreds of American  Citizens are deprived of their lands and rights; and  it is reported that we mean to regain our posses-  sions, and even Jackson County "by the shedding of  blood"; but if any man will take the pains to  read the 1353rd page of the Book of Commandments  he will find it there said, "Wherefore the land of  Zion shall not be obtained but by purchase, or by  blood, otherwise there is none inheritance for you.  And if by purchase behold you are blessed; and  if by blood, as you are forbidden to shed blood lo! your  enemies are upon you and you shall be scourged  from city to city and from synagogue to syna-  gogue, and but few shall stand to receive an  inheritance." So we declare that we have even  meant, and now mean to purchase the land  of our inheritance like all other honest men  of the government and of those who would  rather sell their farms than live in our society.  And as thousands have done before us, we  solicit the aid of the children of men, and  of government to help us obtain our rights in  Jackson County and the land whereon the Zion  of God, according to our faith, shall stand in 
 the last days, for the salvation and gathering  of Israel.    Let no man be alarmed because our soci-  ety has commenced gathering to build a city  and a house for the Lord as a refuge from  present evils and coming calamities. Our fore-  fathers came to the goodly land of America  to shun persecution and enjory their religious  opinions and rights as they thought proper;  and the Lord after much tribulation blessed  them and has said that we should continue  to importune for redress and redemption by the  hands of those who are placed as ruler and  are in authority over us, according to the laws  and constitution of the people, which he has suf-  fered to be establish and should be maintain-  ed for the rights and protection of all flesh  according to just and holy principles; that  every man act in doctrine and in principle  pertaining to futurity according to the moral  agency which  the has given unto them; that  every man may be accountable for his own  sins in the day of Judgment; and for this  purpose he has established the constitution of  this land by the hands of wise men whom he  raised up unto this very purpose, and re-  deemed the land by the shedding of blood. 
 Now we seek peace, and ask our rights  even regress and redemption at the hands of  the rulers of this nation; not only our lands  and property in Jackson County but for free  trade with all men and unmolested emigra-  tion to any part of the Union, and for our  inherent right to worship God as we please.    We ask the rights because they have been  taken from us, or abridged by the violence and  usurpation of the inhabitants of Jackson County.  As a people we hold ourselves amenable to  the laws of the land, and while the government  remains as it is, the right to emigrate from  State to State: from Territory to Territory: from  county to county, and from vicinity to vicinity,  is open to all men of whatsoever trade or creed,  without hindrance or molestation; and as  long as we are justifiable and honest in the  eyes of the law, we claim it, whether we remove  by single families or in bodies of hundreds, with  that of carrying the necessary arms and accou-  trements for military duty; and we believe  that all honest men who love their country  and their country's glory and have a wish to  see the law magnified and made honorable,  will not only help perpetuate the great legacy  of freedom that came unimparired from the 
 July 1834.    hands of our venerable fathers, to us, but they  will also protect us from insult and injury,  and aid the work of God, that they may  reap a reward in the regions of bliss, when  all men receive according to their works.    In relation to our distress, from the want  of our lands in Jackson County, and for the  want of the property destroyed by fire and waste,  rather than do any act contrary to law, we  solemnly appeal to the people with whom we  tarry, for protection from insult and harm;, and  for the comforts of life by labor, or otherwise, while  we seek peace and satisfaction of our enemies  through every possible and honorable means  which humanity can dictate or philanthrophy  urge, or religion require.    We are citizens of this republic, and we ask  our rights as republicans, not merely in our  restoration to our lands and property in Jackson  County, Missouri, but it being considered honest in  our faith, honest in our deal, and honest before  God, till by due course of law. We may be proved  otherwise, reserving the right of every man's be-  ing held amenable to the proper authority for  his own crimes and sins.    "Crowns won by blood, by blood must be main-  tained," and to avoid blood and strife, and 
 more fully satisfy the world that our object  is peace and good will to all mankind, we  hereby appeal for peace to the ends of the earth,  and ask the protection of all people while we  use every fair means in our power to obtain  our rights and immunities without force; set-  ting an example for all true believers that we  will not yield our faith and principles, for  any earthly considerations whereby a precedent  might be established, that a majority may  crush any religious sect with impunity; know-  ing that if we give up our rights in Jackson  County, farewell to society! farewell to religion!  farewell to right! farewell to property! farewell to  life! the fate of our church now, might become  the fate of the Methodist next week, the Catholics  next month, and the overthrow of all societies  next year; leaving nation after nation a wide  waste where reason and friendship once were!  Another and the great object which we mean  to help accomplish is the salvation of the  souls of men; and to bring to pass such a  glorious work, like many other religious denomi-  nations in all ages, we shall license Elders  to preach the everlasting Gospel to all nations  according to the great commandment of our  Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, as recorded in 
 St. Mathew: "Go ye therefore and teach all na-  tions, baptizing them in the name of the Father  and of the Suon and of the Holy Ghost, teach-  ing them to observe all things whatsoever I have  commanded you: and lo I am with you  always, even unto the end of the world."    Thus we shall send laborers into the Lord's  vineyard to gather wheat and prepare the earth  against the day when desolation shall be  poured out without measure; and as it now  is and ever has been considered one of the  most honorable and glorious employments of  men to carry good tidings to the nations,  so we shall expect the clemency of all men,  while we go forth for the last time to gather  Israel for the glory of God, that he may  suddenly come to his temple; that all na-  tions may come and worship in his pres-  ence, when there shall be none to molest or  make afraid, but the earth shall be filled  with his knowledge and glory. We live in  an age of fearful imagination, with all the  sincerity that common men are endowed with,  the Saints have labored without pay to instruct  the United States that the gathering had  commenced in the western boundaries of  Missouri, to build a holy city, where, as may 
 be seen in the 18th chapter of Isaiah: "The present  should be brough[t] unto the Lord of Hosts of a   people scattered and peeled and from a people  terrible from their beginning hitherto; - - - - - - a  nation meeted out and trodden under foot;  whose land the rivers have spoiled;, to the peace  of the name of the Lord of Hosts the Mount  Zion." And how few have come forth rejoicing  that the hour of redemption! and some that  came have turned away, which may cause  thousands to exclaim amid the general confu-  sion and fright of the times, "Remember Lot's  Wife."    It would be a work of supercerogation to  labor to show the truth of the gathering of the  Children of Israel in these last days: For the  prophet told us long ago that it should no  more be said, "The Lord liveth that brought up  the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt,  but the Lord liveth that brought up the Chil-  dren of Israel from the land of the north  and from all the lands whither he had  driven them;" and so it must be for the hon-  or and glory of God.    The faith and religion of the Latter-Day  Saints, are founded upon the old Scriptures,  the Book of Mormon, and direct revelation 
 from God, and while every event that transpires  around us, in evidence of the truth of them,  and an index that the great and terrible day  of the Lord is near, we intreat the philanthro-  pist, the moralist and the honorable men of  all creeds, and sects, to read our publications,  to examine the Bible, the Book of Mormon and  the Commandments, and listen to the fulness  of the gospel, and judge whether we are enti-  tled to the credit of the world, for honest motives  and true principles.    A cloud of bad omen seems to hang  over this generation. Men start up at the im-  pulse of the moment and defy and outstrip all  law, while the destroyer is also abroad in the  earth wasting flesh without measure and  none can stay his course. In the midst  of such portentious times, we feel an anxious  desire to prepare, and help others prepare for  coming events; and we candidly believe  that no honest man will put forth his  hand to stop the work of the Lord, or persecute  the Saints.    In the name of Jesus, we entreat the peo-  ple of this nation to pause before they reject  the words of the Lord, or his servants: These,  like all flesh, may be imperfect "But God is 
 pure hear ye him!    While we ask peace and protection for the  Saints, wherever they may be, we also solicit  the charity and benevolence of all the worthy  on earth, to purchase the righteous a holy  home, a place of rest and a land of peace,  believing that no man who knows he has  a soul will keep back his mite, but cast it in  for the benefit of Zion; thus when time is no  longer, he with all the ransomed of the Lord  may stand in the fulness of joy, and view  the grand pillar of Heaven, which was built  by the faith and charity of the Saints, beginning  at Adam with this motto in the base "Repent   and live" surrounded with a beautiful circle  sign supported by a cross, about midway up  its lofty column, staring the world in letters of  blood "The Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand" and finished  with a plain top, towering up in the midst  of the celestial world, around which is written  by the finger of Jehovah: "Eternal Life is the great-  est gift of God."    Although we may fail to show all men  the truth of the fulness of the Gospel, yet we  hope to be able to convince some that we are  neither deluded nor fanatics, but like other  men have a claim on the world for land 
 and for a living, as good and as great  as our venerable fathers had for indepen-  dence and liberty: that though the world has  been made to believe by false reports and  vague stories, that the Saints (called Mormons)  were meaner than the savages, still God has  been our help in time of trouble and has  provided for us in due season; and to use  the language of Pope, he has let the work  "Spread undivided" and "operate unspent."    For the honor of our beloved country and  the continuation of its free government, we appeal  for peace; for an example of forbearance, and  the diffusion of the everlasting Gospel, we appeal  to the humanity of all nations; and for the  glory of God, before whom we must all answer  for the deeds done in life, and for the hope  of holiness hereafter, we mean to remain faith-  ful to the end, continuing to pray to the Lord  to spare us and the people from whatever is  evil and not calculated to humble us, and  prepare us for His presence and glory: at the  same time beseeching Him in the name of  Jesus to extend His blessings to whom he will,  and his mercy to all, till, by righteousness  the kingdoms of this world become fair as  the sun and clear as the moon.

 July 8, 1834 ~ Tuesday      On the 8th I went to the eastern part of Clay  County and held a meeting at the house of  Thomas B. Marsh in the evening which was com-  posed mostly of High Priests and Elders.  July 9, 1834 ~ Wednesday      And on the 9th I started for Kirtland in com-  pany with my brother Hyrum, Frederick G. Williams,  William E. McLellin and others in a wagon.  July 10, 1834 ~ Thursday      July 10th. Elder Corrill wrote as follows:    "Samuel C. Owens Esquire,  Sir:—  The last time I saw you  in Liberty you said that an answer to our  proposals, you thought, would be forwarded soon,  but it has not been done.    We are anxiously waiting to have a com-  promise effected if possible. Respecting our wheat  in Jackson County, can it be secured so that  we can receive the avails of it or not, seeing  we are at present prohibited the privilege.  John Corrill.  P.S. Please hand the following to Colonel Pitcher"    "Col. Thomas Pitcher. Liberty, July 10th, 1834.  Sir:—  The following is a true copy of   and order from the Governor for our arms.    Have the goodness to return an answer 
 as soon as possible, that we may know whether  we can have the arms upon said order, or  not, also when. Send where we can receive them  and we will appoint an agent to receive and  receipt the same. Be assured that we do not  wish to obtain them from any hostile inten-  tions, but merely because the right of property  is ours. If I remember right, there is one gun  and a sword more then the order clalls for.  John Corrill."    There followed a copy of the Governor's order,  similar to that of the Governor to Col. Lucas of the  2nd of May.  July 12, 1834 ~ Sunday      On the 12th, the High Council of Zion assembled  in Clay County, and appointed Edward Part-  ridge, Orson Pratt, Isaac Morley, and Zebedee  Coltrin to visit the scattered and afflicted Breth-  ren in that region, and teach them the ways  of truth and holiness, and set them in order  according as the Lord should direct; but that  was not wisdom for the Elders generally to hold  public meetings in that region.    It was decided that Amasa Lyman as-  sist Lyman Wight in his mission of gathering the  strength of the Lord's House as I had appoin-  ted him.  July 31, 1834 ~ Thursday      July 31st. The High Council of Zion assembled 
 and heard the report of Edward Partridge, Orson  Pratt, Zebedee Coltrin and Isaac Morley, concer-  ning the mission appointed them at the previous  council.    President David Whitmer gave the council  some good instruction; that it was their duty  to transact all business in order, and when  any case is brought forward for investigation  every member should be attentive and patient to  what is passing in all cases and avoid con-  fusion and contention, which is offensive in the  sight of the Lord. He also addressed the Elders  and said that it is not pleasing in the sight  of the Lord for any man to go forth to preach  the gospel of peace unless he is qualified to set  forth its principles in plainness to those he en-  deavors to instruct, and also the rules and regu-  lations of the Church of Latter Day Saints: for  just as a man is and as he teaches and  acts, so will his followers be, let them be ever  so full of notions and whims. He also ad-  dressed the congregation and told them that  it was not wisdom for the brethren to vote at  the approaching election, and the Council ac-  quiesced in the instruction of the President.    William W. Phelps proposed to the Council  to appoint a certain number of Elders to 
 hold public meetings in that section of coun-  try as often as should be deemed necessary to  teach the disciples how to escape the indigna-  tion of their enemies and keep in favor with  those who were friendly disposed and Simeon  Carter, John Corrill, Parley P. Pratt and Orson Pratt  were appointed by the unanimous voice of the  Council and congregation to fill the mission.    Elder Nathan West preferred charges against  Samuel Brown, High Priest, for teaching contrary  to counsel, namely; encouraging the brethren  in practicing gifts (speaking in tongues); in or-  daining Sylvester Hulet, High Priest, (without coun-  sel) in a clandestine manner; asserting that  he had obtained a witness of the Lord which  was a promise of performing the same, in  receiving the gift of tongues, which gift he had  never before received, but afterwards said that  he had been in possession of that gift for the  space of a year; and in seeming to under-  value the authority or righteousness of the High  Council by charging Elder West not to say  anything that would tend to prejudice  their minds that they might not judge  righteously. These charges were sustained by the  testimony of Leonard Rich, Charles English, Brother  Bruce, Edward Partridge, Hiram Page, Roxa Slade 
 Caleb Baldwin, and Silvester Hulet; and Pres-  ident David Whitmer gave the following decision  which was sanctioned by the Council.    According to testimony and the voice of the  Holy Spirit which is in us, we say unto you  that God in his infinite mercy doth yet grant  you a space for repentance, therefore if you  confess all the charges which have been alleged  against you, to be just and in a spirit that  we can receive it, then you can stand as  a private member in this Church; otherwise  we have no fellowship for you: and also that  the ordination of Sylvester Hulet by Samuel  Brown is illegal and not acknowledged by  us to be of God, therefore it is void and  of none effect." Brother Brown confessed the char-  ges and gave up his licences but retained his  membership. Council adjourned on the evening  of the first of August, but previous to adjourn-  ing the council gave the following letter to  the Elders appointed to visit the churches in  Clay Co. &c.    To the Latter Day Saints who have been  driven from the land of their inheritance and  also those who are gathering in the regions  round about in the western boundaries of  Missouri, the High Council established according 
 to the pattern given by our beloved Savior Jesus  Christ, send greeting:    Dear Brethren:—  We have appointed our  beloved brother and companion in tribulation,  John Corrill to meet you in the name of the  Lord Jesus. He in connection with others duly  appointed also, will visit you alternately for  the purpose of instructing you in the necessary  qualifications of the Latter Day Saints: that  they may be perfected, that the officers and  members of the body of Christ may become  very prayerful and very faithful, strictly keep-  ing all the commandments and walking  in holiness before the Lord continually. That  all that mean to have the "destroyer pass  over them as the children of Israel and not  slay them," may live according to the "Word  of Wisdom"; that the Saints by industry, dili-  gence and faithfulness and the prayer of faith,  may become purified, and enter upon their  inheritance to build up Zion according to the  word of the Lord.    We are sure if the Saints are very humble,  very watchful, and very prayerful, that few will  be deceived by those who have not authority  to teach, or who have not the spirit to teach 
 according to the power of the Holy Ghost, in  the Scriptures, lest any man's blood should  be required at your hands, we beseech you  as you value the salvation of souls, and  are within, to set an example worthy to be fol-  lowed by those without the Kingdom of our God  and His Christ, that peace by grace, and bles-  sings by righteousness may attend you till  you are sanctified and redeemed."    (Signed) Clay County, August 1st, 1834.    About this time I arrived at Kirtland,  after a tedious journey in the midst of enemies,  mobs, cholera and excessively hot weather, hav-  ing parted from those whom I started with  on the 9th ult. at different points of the journey.

 Mem. to Heeton  The box for Harriet must  be seal up forthwith    I. H Modesitt  Tavern - Clevesland    Dec 19th 1841 I willford met at the  house of Joseph Smith the seer this evening to hear  Preaching by Elder Kimball he opened by prayer  read a chapter in the Book of Mormon & then spoke  as he was led by the spirit of God, among other things  he spoke a parable of the clay in the hands of  the potter that when it mared in the hands of the  potter it was lade aside to join the next batch & was  a vessel of hishonour but all clay that formed well  in the hands of the potter & was pliable was a vessel of  honour & thus it was with the human family &  still is, all that are pliable in the hands of God &  are obediant to the commands of God are vessels   of honour & God will receive them &c.    (After Sidney Roberts had occupied the meeting  a season) Joseph arose & read a chapter in the  New Testiment containing the parable of the vine &  its Branches & explained it much to our edifycation, &  said "if we kept the commandments of God we  should bring forth fruit & be the friends of God &  know what our lord did & he would reveal his  secrets unto us but his servent knew, not what his Lord 
 doeth. Some say Joseph is a fallen prophet because  he does not bring forth more of the word of the Lord  why does he not do it, are we able to receive it No  not one in this room" he then chastised us for our  wickedness & unbelief knowing that whome the  Lord loveth he chasteneth & scourgeth evry son &  daughter whome he receiveth, & if we do not receive  it then are we bastards & not sons. On revelation he  said a man would command his son to dig potatoes  then saddle his horse but before he done either tell him  to do something els, this is all considerd right but the  moment the Lord gives a commandment & revokes  that decree & commands sumthing els the prophet is  then considered fallen &c.    Because we will not receive chastizment at the hand of  the prophet or Apostles the Lord chastizes us with  sickness & death. Let not any man publish his own  righteousnes for others can do that for him sooner let him  confess his sins & then he will be forgiven & bring forth  more fruit. When a man is chastised he gets angry &  will not endure it. The reason we do not have the  secrets of the Lord revealed unto us is because we  do not keep them but reveal them, what greater  love hath any man than to lay down his life for his friend  then we should fight for our friend untill we die    Elder B. Young arose & said one thing lay with wait  on his mind ie that we should be prepared to keep each  commandment as it came from the Lord by the  mouth of the prophet, & as the Lord had commanded  us to build a temple we should do it spedily    Jan 30th Joseph the Seer taught the following principles  that the God & father of our Lord Jesus Christ was  once the same as the Son or Holy Ghost but havi  ng redeemed a world became the eternal God of  that world he had a son Jesus Christ who redeem  ed this earth the same as his father had a world which  made them equal & the Holy Ghost would do  the same in his turn & so would all the Saints 
 who inherited a SCelestial glory so their would  be Gods many & Lords many their were many  mansions even 12 from the abode of Devils to  the SCelestial glory All spirits that have bodies have  power over those that have not hence men have  power over Devils &c  [rest of page blank]

 A Revelation given Kirtland july 23rd 1837    The word of the Lord unto Thomas B.  Marsh concerning the twelve apostles of  the Lamb. Verily thus saith the Lord  unto you my servant Thomas I have  herd thy prayers & thine alms have come   up as a memorial before me in behalf  of those thy Brethren who were chosen to  bear testimony of my name & to  send it abroad among all nations kindreds  tongues & people & ordained through the in-  strumentality of my servents. Verily  I say unto you, there has been some  things in thine heart & with thee with  which I the Lord was not well pleased  nevertheless inasmuch as thou hast  abased thyself thou shalt be exalted 
 therefore all thy sins are forgiven thee  let thy heart be of good cheer before  my face & thou shalt bear record  of my name not ownly unto the  gentiles but also unto the Jews & thou  shalt send forth my word unto the  ends of the earth contend thou there  fore morning by morning & day after  day let thy warning voice go forth &  when the night cometh let not the  inhabitants of the earth slumber  because of thy speach let thy habitation  [ink change] be known in Zion & remove not thy  house for I the Lord have a great work for  thee to do in publishing my name among  the Children of Men, therefore gird up  your loins for the work let your 
 feet be shod also for thou art chosen  & thy path lyeth among the mountains  and among the mountains many nations  and by thy word many high ones shall  be brought low & by thy word many  low ones shall be exalted, thy voice  shall be a rebuke unto the transgr  essor, and at thy rebuke let the tongue  of the slanderer cease its perversness.  Be thou humble & the Lord thy God shall  lead thee by thy hand & give thee an  answer to thy prayers I know thy  heart & have heard thy prayers concer-  ning thy brethren [ink change] be not partial towa  rds them in love above many others but  let your love be for them as for yourself  and let your love abound unto all men 
 and unto all who love my name and  pray for your Brethren of the Twelve.  Admonish them sharply for my name  sake & let them be admonished for all  their sins & be ye faithful before me  unto my name & after their temptations  & much tribulations behold I the Lord  will feel after them & if they harden not  there hearts & stiffen not their necks  against me they shall be converted and I  will heal them. Now I say unto you  and what I say unto you I say unto  all the Twelve arise & gird up your loins  take up your cross follow me & feed  my sheep exalt not yourselves, rebel  not against my servent Joseph for  verily I say unto you, I am with 
 him & my hand shall be over him &  the keys which I have given him &  also to youward shall not be taken  from him untill I come. Verily  I say unto you, my servent Thomas  thou art the man whome I have chosen  to hold the keys of my kingdom as  pertaining to the Twelve abroad  among all Nations that thou mayest  be my servent to unlock the door of the  Kingdom in all places where my serva-  nt Joseph & my servant Sidney and my  servant Hyrum cannot come for  ion them have I layed the burden of  all the Churches, for a little season  wherefore whithersoever they shall send  you go ye & I will be with you 
 in whatsoever place ye shall proclaim  my name an affectual door shall be  open unto you that they may receive  my word. Whosoever recieveth my word  recieveth me & whosoever recieveth me  recieveth those the first presidency whome  I have sent whome I have made counsellors  for my name sake unto you. and again  I say unto you that whosoever ye shall  send in my name by the voice of your  Brethren the Twelve duly recomme-  nded & authorized by you shall have  power to open the door of my kingdom,  unto any nation whithersoever ye  shall send them inasmuch as they humble  themselves before me and abide in my words  & harken to the voice of my Spirit. Verily  verily I say unto you darkness covereth 
 the earth & gross darkness covereth the  mind of the people and all fellesh hath  become corrupt before my face.  Behold vengance cometh spedily upon the  inhabitants of the earth, a day of wrath   a day of burning, a day of destruction  of weeping, of mourning, and of lamenta-  tion, as& as a whilrlwind it shall come  upon all the face of the earth saith the  Lord & upon my house shall it begin  & from my house shall it go forth  saith the Lord first upon those among  you saith the Lord who have professed to   know my name & have not known  me but have blasphemed against me  in the midst of my house saith the Lord  thereforth see to it that ye trouble 
 not yourselves concerning the affairs  of my church in this place saith the  Lord but purify your hearts before  me & then go ye into all the world  & preach my gospel unto every creat-  ure who have not recieved it & he that  believeth & is baptized shall be saved &  he that believeth not & is not baptized  shall be damned, for unto you  (the Twelve) & those (the first presid-  ency) who are appointed with you to  be your councsillors and your  leaders is the power of this priesthood given  for the last days & for the last time in the  which is the dispensation of the fulness of  times which power you hold in connection  with all those who have received a dispensation  at any time from the beginning of the Creation 
 for verily I say unto you the keys of  the dispensation which ye have received  have come down from the fathers &  last of all being sent down from heaven  unto you verily I say unto you  behold how great is your calling.  Clense your hearts & your garments  lest the blood of this generation be req  uired at your hands. Be faithful  untill I come for I come quickly  & my reward is with me to recompense  every man according as his work shall  be. I am Alpha and Omega Amen    [FIGURE] As there are many keys to the kingdom  of God the following one will detect Satan  when he transforms himself nigh unto  an angel of light. When Satan appears 
 in the form of a personage unto man  & reaches out his hand unto him & the  man takes hold of his hand & feels no  substance he may know it is Satan  for an angel of God (which is an angel  of light) is a Saint with his resurrected  body & when he appears unto man  & offers him his hand & the man feels  a substance when he takes hold of it as  he would in shaking hands with his ne-  ighbour he may know it is a Angel  of God, & should a Saint appear unto  man whose body is not resurrected he  will never offer him his hand for it  would be ^a^gainst the law by which they  are governed & by observing this key we  may detect Satan [ink blot] that he decieve us  not [FIGURE] 
 The following important items & plain  & precious principles were delivered unto  the Twelve from Joseph in Montrose  Ioway Territory July 1st 1839    Ever keep in exercise the principle of mercy  & be ready to forgive our brother on the first  intimations of repentance & asking forgiveness,  & should we ever forgive our brother or even  our enemy before they repent or ask forgiveness  our heavenly father would be equally as mercif-  ul unto us. Again let the Twelve & all  Saints be willing to confess all their sins  & not keep back a part & let the twelve  be humble & not be exalted & beware of  pride & not seek to excell one above another  but act for each others good & pray for one &  another & honour oveur brother or make 
 honourable mention of his name & not  backbite & devour our brother. Why [won't]  not man learn wisdom by precept of this   late age of the world where we have such a  cloud of witnesses & examples before us  & not be obliged to learn by sad experi  ance every thing we know. must the new  ones that are chosen to fill the places  of those that our fallen of the quorum of the  Twelve begin to exalt themselves untill  they exhalt themselves so high that they will  even tumble over & have a great fall  & go wallowing through the mud &  mire & darkness Judas like to the  buffetings of Satan as several of the quor  um of the Twelve have done or will they  learn wisdom & be wise. [##Matthew 27:3-5##] (O God give them  wisdom & keep them humble I pray) 
 When the Twelve or any other witnesses  stand before the congregations of the earth  & they preach in the power & demonstration  of the spirit of God & the people are asstonis[h]ed  & confounded at the doctrin & say that  that man has preached a powerful discourse  a great sermon then let that man or  those men take care that they do not ass  cribe the glory unto themselves but be ca-  reful that they are humble & ascribe the  praise & glory to God & the Lamb for  it is by the power of the Holy Priesthood  & Holy Ghost they have power thus to speak:  what art thou O man but dust & pain  wholm dost thou receive thy power & blessings  but from God Then O ye Twelve notice  this [FIGURE] key & be wise for Christ sake & your  own so[u]ls sake 
 Ye are not sent out to be taught but  to teach. let every word be seasoned with  grace be vigilent be sober, it is a day of  warning & not of many words. act honest  before God & man beware of gentile  sophestry such as bowing & scraping unto  men in whom you have no confidence  be honest open & frank in all your inter  course with mankind.    O ye Twelve & all Saints profit by this im  portant Key [FIGURE] that in all your trials  troubles, temptations; afflictions, bonds,  imprisionments, & death see to it that you  do not betray heaven, that you do not betray  Jesus Christ, that you do not betray your  Brethren, that you do not betray the revela  tions of God, whether in the Bible Book of  Mormon or Doctrins & Covenants or 
 any other that ever was or ever will be given  & revealed unto man in this world or that  which is to come, yea in all your kicking  & floundering see to it that you do not this  thing lest innocent blood be found in your  skirts & you go down to hell. all  other sins are not to be compared to sinning  against the Holy Ghost & poroving a traitor  to thy brethren (A final [FIGURE] key delivered  from Joseph in the following language.) I will  give you one of the keys of the miysteries of  the kingdom. It is an eternal principle  that has existed with God for all eternity  that that man who rises up to condemn  others [ink blot] finding fault with the Church  saying that they are out of the way while  he himself is righteous, then know assur  edly that that man is in the high road 
 to apostacy & if he does not repent will  apostitize as God live, the principle is as  correct as the one that Jesus put forth  in saying that that person he who seeketh  after a sign is an adulterous person  & that principle is ^eternal^ undeviating & firm  as the pillars of heaven for whenever you  see a man seeking after a sign you may   set it down that he is an adulterous  man. [FIGURE]    Other important items of doctrins from  Joseph given in Commerce Ill.    The pure testimony of the servents  of God in all ages of the world is  attended with the Spirit of Revelation  & prophecy, or in other words faith  comes by hearing the word of God & the 
 On the doctrin's of faith  Faith comes by hearing the word  of God through the testimony of the  Servents of God that Testimony is alw-  ays attended by the spirit of prophecy  & revelation.    Repentance  Is a thing that cannot be trifled with  every day. Daily transgression & daily  repentance is not that which is pleasing  in the sight of God [FIGURE]    Baptism  Is a Holy ordinance preparatory to  the reception of the Holy Ghost,; It is the  channel & key by which the Holy Ghost  will be administered. The gift of the  Holy Ghost by the laying ofn of hands 
 cannot be recieved through the  medium of any other principle  than the principle of righteousness  for if the proposals are not complyied  with it is of no use but withdraws    Tongues  Were given for the purpose of preach-  ing among those whose language  is not understood as on the day of pen-  tecost &c, & it is not necessary for  tongues to be taught to the Church  particularly, for any man that  has the Holy Ghost can speak of the things  of God in his own tongue as well  as to speak in another. for faith  comes not by signs but by hearing  the word of God. [FIGURE] 
 The doctrin of the Resurrection of the  Dead and Eternal judgment are  necisary to preach among the first  principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.    The Doctrin of Election  St Paul exhorts us to make our calling  & election shure. This is that Sealing  power spoken of by Paul in other places  see ##Ephesians 1:13-14|Ephe 1st 13–14 v## that we may be sealed up  unto the day of redemption, this principle  ought (in its proper place) to be taught  for God hath not revealed any thing to Joseph  but what he will make known unto  the Twelve & even the least saint  may know all things as fast as he is  able to bear them for the day must  come when no man need say 
 to his neighbour know ye the  Lord for all shall know him (who  remain) from the least to the greatest  How is this to be done. it is to be done  by this sealing power & the other comforter  spoken of which will be manifest by  revelation. There is two comforters  spoken of, the first comforter is the Holy  Ghost the same as given on the day of  pentecost & that all Saints receive  after faith, repentance & baptism.  This first comforter or Holy Ghost has  no other affect than pure intelligence  It is more powerful in expanding  the mind enlightening the understanding  & storeing the intellect with present  knowledge of a man who is of the 
 litteral seed of Abram thhan one  that is a gentile though it may not  have half as much visible affect upon  the body for as the Holy Ghost falls up  on one of the literal seed of Abram it  is came [calm] & serene & his whole soul  & and body ownly exercised by the pure  spirit of Intelligence. While the aff-  ect of the Holy Ghost upon a gentile is  to purge out the old blood & make  him actually of the seed of Abram  That man that has none of tehe  Blood of Abram (naturally) must  have a new creation by the Holy Ghost  in such a case there may be mo  re of a powerful affect upon the body  & visible to the eye than upon an 
 Israelite while the Israelite at first  might be far before the gentile  in pure intelligence. The other com  forter spoken off is a subject of great  interest & perhaps understood by few of  this generation. [ink change] After a person hath faith  in Christ, repents of his sins & is baptized for  the remission of his sins & receives the Holy  Ghost (by the laying on of hands,) which is the   first comforter then let him continue  to humble himself before God hungering  & thirsting after righteousness & living by  every word of God, & the Lord will soon  say unto him Son thou shalt be exalted,  &c. When the Lord has thoroughly proved him  & find that the man is determined to serve  him at all hazard then the man will find 
 his calling & election made sure then  it will be his privilege to receive the other  Comforter which the Lord hath promised  the Saints as is recorded in the testimony of  St. [##John 14:12-27|John##] in the XIV ch from the 12 to the 27 vers  note the 16-17-18-21:23 verses. Now what is this  other Comforter it is no more or less  than the Lord Jesus Christ himself &  this is the sum & substance of the whole  matter that when any man obtains this  last Comforter he will have the personage  of Jesus Christ to attend him or appear unto  him from time to time & even he will  manifest the father unto him & they will  take up there abode with him & the visions  of the heavens will be opened unto him &  the Lord will teach him face to face & 
 he may have a perfect knowledge of the mys-  teries of the kingdom of God, & this is the  state & place where the ancient Saints arived  at when they saw such glorious visions, Isaiah  Ezekiel, John upon the Isle of Patmos, Greece, St  paul in the third heavens & all the Saints who  held communion with the general  assembly & church of the first born &c.    The spirit of revelation is in connexion  with those blessings. A person may profit  by noticeing the first intimations of the spirit  of revelation for Instance when you feel  pure intelligence flowing unto you it  may give you sudden shak[e]s of Ideas  that by noticing it you may find it fulfi-  lled the same day or soon ie those things  that were presented unto your minds by the 
 spirit of God will come to pass & thus  by learning the spirit of God & understanding  it you may grow into the principle of  revelation untill you become perfected  in Christ Jesus.    An Evangelist  Is a patriarch even the oldest man  of the Blood of Joseph or of the seed of  Abram wharever the Church of Christ  is esstablished in the earth there should  be a patriarch for the benefit of the  posterity of the Saints, as it was with  Jacob in given [giving] his patriarchal blessing  unto his sons &c. 
 Revelation given June 22, 1834, Clay County Mo.    Verily I say unto you who have assembled  together that you may learn my will con-  cerning the redemption of Zion mine  afflicted people. Behold I say unto you,  were it not for the transgressions of my people  speaking concerning the Church & not  individually they might have been redee-  med even now, but behold they have not  learned to be obedient to the things  which I require at there hands but  are full of all manner of evil and do  not impart of their substance as  becometh Saints, (to the poor &  afflicted among them) and are not  united according to the union required  by the Law of the Celestial Kingdom. 
 And Zion cannot be built up  unless it is by the principles of the  Law of the Celestial Kingdom, otherwise  I cannot recieve her unto myself  and my people must needs be chastened  untill they become obedient if it  must needs be by the things which  they suffer, I speak not concern-  ing those who are appointed to lead my  people who are the first Elders of my  Church for they are not all under  condemnation but I speak con-  cerning the Church abroad. their are  many who will say whare is their God, behold  He will deliver in times of trouble otherw-  ise we will not go up unto Zion & will  keep our monies. Therefore in consequence 
 of the transgressions of my people it  is expedient in me that mine Elders  should weight for a little season for  the redemption of Zion that they them-  selves may be prepared & that my  people may be taught more perfe-  ctly concerning their duty & have  experience & know more perfectly  concerning their duty & the things  which I require at their hands &  this cannot be brought to pass  untill mine Elders are endowed with  power from on High for behold I  have prepared a great endowment  & blessing to be poured out upon  them inasmuch as they are faithf  ul, & continue in humility before me 
 Therefore it is expedient in me that  mine Elders should weight for a little  season for the redemption of Zion  for behold I do not require at their  hands to fight the battles of Zion for  as I have said in a former commandm-  ent even so I will fulfill. I will fight  your battles; Behold the destroyer  I have already sent forth to destroy  & lay waste mine enemies & not  many years hence they shall not  be left to pollute mine heritage &  to blaspheme my name upon the  land which I have consecrated for  the gathering to gether of my Saints. Behold  I have commanded my Servent Joseph  to say to the strength of my house, even 
 my wariors my young men & mid-  dle aged to gather together for the redemption  of my people & throw down the towers of  mine enemies & scatter th[e]ir watchmen  but the strength of mine house has  not harkened unto my words, but  inasmuch as their are those that have  harkened unto my words, I have  prepared a blessing & an endowment  for them I have herd their prayers &  will eccept their offering & it is expe-  dient in me that they should be broug  ht thus far, for a trial of their  faith, & verily I give unto you that  as many as have come up hither that  can stay in the regions round about let  them stay, & those that cannot stay who 
 have families in the East, let them  stay for a little season inasmuch as  my servent Joseph shall appoint unto  them for I will council him conce-  rning this matter; and all things whatso-  ever he shall appoint unto them shall  be fulfilled & let all my people who  dwell in the region round about be very  faithful & prayerful & humble before  me & reveal not the things which  I have revealed unto them. Talk  not of judgment, boast not of faith,  nor of mighty works, but carefully  gather together as much in one region  as can be consistantly with the feeling  of the people. And behold I will give unto  you favor & grace in their eyes, that 
 you may rest in peace & safety  whilst you are saying unto the people  execute judgment & justice for us  according to law & redress us of our  wrongs. Now behold I say unto you  my friends in this way you may find  favor in the eyes of the people unt-  ill the armies of Israel become  vary great & I will soften the hearts  of the people as I did the heart of  Phariaoh from time to time untill  my servent Joseph & mine Elders  whom he shall appoint shall have time  to gather the strength of my house &  to have some ^sent^ wise men to fulfill  that which I have communicated  concerning the purchesies of all the 
 lands in Jackson County that  can be purchased & in the adjoining  counties round about for it is my  will that their lands should be purchased  & after they are purchased that my Saints  possess them according to the law of  Consecration which I have given &  after these lands are purchased I will  hold the armies of Israel guiltless in  taking possession of their own lands  & of throwing down the towers of mine  enemies that may be upon them & scatt-  ering their watchman & avenging me  of mine enemies unto the third & fourth  generation of them hate hate me. But  finally let my army become very  great & let it be sanctified before me 
 that it may become fair as the Sun  & clear as the Moon & that her banne  rs may be terrible unto all nations  that the kingdoms of this world may  be constrained to acknowledge  that the kingdom of Zion is in very deed  the kingdom of our God & his Christ  therefore let us become subject  unto her laws. Verily I say unto  you it is expedient in me that the first  Elders in My Church should recieve  their endowment from on high in  my house which I have command  ed to be built unto my name in  the land of Kirtland & let those  commandments which I have given  concerning Zion & her law be execu- 
 ted & fulfilled after her redemption;  There has been a day of calling but  the time has come for a day of chusing  & let those be chosen that are worthy  & it shall be manifest unto my servent  Joseph by the voice of the Spirit those  who are chosen & they shall be sanct  ified & in as much as they follow the cou  ncil which they receive they shall have  power after many days to accomplish  all things appertaining to Zion. And again  I say unto you sue for peace not own  ly the people that have smitten you but also  to all people & lift up an ensign of peace  & make a proclamation for peace unto  the ends of the earth & make proposals for peace  unto those who have smitten you 
 according to the voice of the spirit which  is in you & All things shall work together  for your good, & be faithful & behold  & lo I am with you even untill  the end even so Amen  [FIGURE]    Prophecy or Commandment given December 25th AD 1832    Verily thus saith the Lord concerni  ng the wars that will shortly come to  pass begining at the rebellion of  South Carolina which will eventu-  ally terminate in the death & misery  of many souls; and the days will come  that war will be poured out upon  all Nations begining at this place for  behold the Southern States shall be  divided against the Northern States

 A Revelation given at Kirtland    Verily I say unto you my friends  Behold I will give unto you a revelation  & commandment that you may  know how to act in the discharge of your  duties concerning the salvation and  redemption of your brethren who have  been scattered from the land of Zion  being driven & smitten by the hand of  mine enemies on whome I will pour  out my wrath without measure in  mine own time for I have suffered them  thus far that they might fill up the mea  sure of their iniquity that their cup might  be full & that those who call themselves after  my name might be chastened for a little  season with a sore & grievious chastizement [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:1-4##] 
 and ever. But inasmuch as they keep  not my commandments & harken not  to observe all my words then the Kingdom  of the world [blank] prevail against them, for  they were set to be saviors of men  and inasmuch as they are not the sav-  iors of men they are as salt that hath  lost its savor and is thenceforth good  for nothing but to be cast out &  be trodden under foot of men,  but verily I say unto you I have  decreeed that your brethren which had  been scattered shall return to the  lands of their inheritantsces and build up  the waste place of Zion [ink change] for after  which tribulation as I have said  unto you in a former commandment [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:7-12##] 
 cometh the blessing which I have  promised in a former command-  ment after your tribulations  & the tribulations of your Brethren   your redemption & the redemption  of your brethren even their rede  mption to the land of Zion to be  established no more to be thrown  down; nevertheless if they shall  pollute their inheritance they shall  be thrown down for I will not  spare them if they pollute their  Inheritances. Behold I say unto  you that the redemption of Zion  must needs come of power, therefore  I [blank] ^{shorthand}^[g]^ raise up unto my people a  [page folded]an who shall lead them like as [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:12-16##] 
 Moses led the Children of Israel   for ye are the Children of Israel  & of the seed of Abram & ye m  ust needs be led out of bondage  by power & with an out stretched  arm "even as your fathers were  led" at the first even so shall the  Redemption of Zion, therefore let   not your hearts faint, for I  say not unto you as I said unto  your fathers, mine Andels shall  go up before you & not my pre  sence, but I say unto you  mine angel shall go up before  you & also my presence & in  time ye shall possess the goodly land.  Verily, verily, I say unto you [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:16-21##] 
 that my Servant {shorthand} is the man  to wholm I liken the Saints to  whome the Lord of the  vineyard spoke  in the parable which I have given  unto you. Therefore let my  Servent Joseph say unto the strength  of my house my young men  & middle aged gather together unto  the land of Zion upon the land which  I have bought with monies that  have been consecrated unto me  & let all the churches send up wise   men with their monies & purchase  lands even as I have commanded  them. & inasmuch as mine  enemies come against you to  drive you from off my goodly land [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:21-24##] 
 which I have consecrated to be  the land of Zion even your own  land. After these testimonies wh-  ich ye have brought before me against  them ye shall course ^curse^ them & who-  msoever ye will course ^curse^ I will curse  & ye shall avenge me of my enemies  & my presence shall be with you  even in avenging me of mine enem  ies unto the third & fourth generatio[ns]  of them that hate me. Let no man  be afraid to lay down his life for  my sake for whoso layeth down  his life for my sake shall find it  again & whoso is not willing to lay down  his life for my sake is not my deciple.  It is my will that my servent Sidney [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:24-29##] 
 should lift up his voice in the con  gregations in the eastern country  in preparing the Churches to keep the  commandments which I have given  unto them concerning the restorat-  ion & redemption of Zion. It is my  will that my servent parly & my  servant Lyman should not retu  rn to the land of their brethren un  till they have obtained companies  to go up unto the land of Zion by  tens, or twenties or by fifties or  by hundreds, untill they have obt-  ained unto the number of five  hundred of the strength of my house,  behold this is my will therefore if you  cannot obtain five hundred [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:29-32##] 
 seak diligently that peradventure  ye may obtain three and if ye  cannot obtain three hundred  seak diligently that peradventu-  re ye may obtain one hundred  but verily I say unto you a  commandment I give unto you  that you shall not go up unto  the land of Zion untill you  have obtained a hundred of  the strength of my house to  go up with you unto the land  of Zion therefore as I said unto  you ask and ye shall receive  pray earnestly that peradven-  ture my servant Joseph may  go with you and preside in [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:32-35##]

We are acquainted with the  course the devel persues in making trouble  in the church of Christ. Satan is not so  destitute of power as some suppose he  is The Lord & all Heaven have had to wage  war with him & his influence in Eterni  ty, & it is by keeping the Law of God &  giving heed to the officers of his church in  order to overcome.

And after  this time your baptisms for  the dead by those who are scattered  abroad are not acceptable unto me  Saith the Lord for it is ordained that  in Zion & in her Stakes & in  Jerusalem those places which I  have appointed for refuge shall  be the places for your baptisms  for your dead.    And again   varily I say unto you how  shall your washings be acceptable  unto me except you perform  them in a house which you  have built to my name?  For, for this cause I commanded [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:34-38##] 
 Moses that he should build a tab-  ernacle that they should bear it  with them in the wilderness  & to build a house in the Land of  promise that those ordinances  might be revealed which had  been hid from before the world  was therefore varily I say unto  you that your annointings  & your washings & your bap-  tisms for the dead, & your Solomn  Assemblies, & your memorials  for your Sacrifizces by the Sons  of Levi and for your oracles in  your most Holy places wharein  you receive conversations and  your statutes & judgments for [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:38-39##] 
 the beginning of the revelations &  foundation of Zion, & for the glory  & honour & endowment of all her  municipals and ^are^ ordained by the  Ordinance of my holy house  which my people are always com-  manded to build unto my Holy  name. And verily I say unto  you let this house be built  unto my name that I may  reveal mine ordinances therein  unto my people, for I deign to  reveal unto my Church things  which have been kept hid from  before the foundation of the world,   things which pertain to the dispensat  ion of the fulness of times & I will  shew unto my Servant Joseph [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:39-42##] 
 all things pertaining to this house  & the priesthood thereof & the place  whareon it shall be built, & ye  shall build it on the place whare  you have contemplated building  it, for that is the place which  I have chosen ^for you^ to build it. If  ye labour with all your might  I will consecrate that spot that it  shall be made holy & if my  people will harken unto my voice  & unto the voice of my Servants  whome I have appointed to lead my  people behold verily I say unto  you they shall not be moved  out of their place, but if they will  not harken to my voice nor unto the [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:42-46##] 
 voice of my Servents whome I have  appointed they shall not be blessed  because they pollute my Holy ground  and mine Holy Ordinances and charte[rs]  & miyne ^my^ Holy words which I give  unto them, & it shall come to pass  that if you build a house unto  my name & do not do the things  that I say I will not perform the  oath which I make unto you  neither fulfill the promise which  ye expect at my hands saith the  Lord, for instead of blessings, ye  by your own works bring cursi[ngs]  wrath, indignation & judgment upo[n]  your own heads by your follies  & by all your abominations which  you practice before me saith the [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:46-48##] 
 Lord. Verily, verily, I say unto  you that when I give a commandme  nt unto any of the Sons of men  to do a work unto my name & those  Sons of men go with all their mi  ghts & with all they have to perform  that work & cease not their diligence  and their enemies come upon the-  m & hinder them from performing  that work behold it behoveth me  to require that work no more at  the hands of those Sons of men  but to accept of their offering  & the iniquity & transgression of  my Holy laws & commandments  I will visit upon the Heads of those  who hindered my work unto the third  & forurth generation so long as they [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:48-50##] 
 repent not, & hate me saith the Lord  God. Therefore for this cause have  I accepted of the offerings of those men  whome I commanded to build up a  city & an House unto my name  in Jackson County Missouri  & were hindered by their enemies saith  the Lord your God. and I will an-  swer judgment wrath & indignation  wailing & anguish & gnashing of  teeth upon their heads unto the third  & fourth generation so long as they  repent not and hate me saith the  Lord your God. and this I make  an ensample unto you for your  consolation concerning all those  who have been commanded to [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:50-53##] 
 to do a work & have been hindered  by the hands of their enemies &  by oppression saith the Lord your  God, for I am the Lord your God  & will save all those of your Brethren  who have been pure in heart &  have been slain in the Land of  Missouri saith the Lord. And again  verily I say unto you I com-  mand you again to build a  house to my name even in this  place that ye may prove your-  selves unto me that ye are faithful  in all things whatsoever I command  you that I may bless you  & crown you with honour immor  tality & eternal life. [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:53-55##] 
 And now I say unto you as  pertaining to my boarding house  which I have commanded you  to build for the boarding of strangers  let it be built unto my name  & let my name be named upon  it, & let my Servant Joseph &  his house have place therein  from generation to generation  for this annointing have I put  upon his head, that his blessing shall  also be put upon the heads of  his posterity after him, & as I  said unto Abraham concerning  the kindreds of the earth even so I  say unto my Servent Joseph  in thee & in they [thy] seed shall the  kindreds of the Earth be blessed.

 Therefore let my Servant Joseph  and his seed after him have place  in that house from generation  to generation forever & ever saith  the Lord, & let the Name of that  House be called the NAUVOO HOUSE  let it be a delightful habitation  for man & a resting place for the  weary traveller that he may con-  template the glory of Zion & the  glory of this the corner stone  thereof that he may also receive  the council from those whom  I have set to be as plants of renown  & as watchman upon her walls.  Behold verily I say unto you  let my servant George Miller [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:59-62##] 
 & my servant Lyman Wight &  my servant John Snider & my  servant Peter Hawes organize  themselves & apoint one of them to  be a president over their quorum  for the purpose of building that  House & they shall form a constit-  ution whareby they may receive  stock for the building of that house  & they shall not receive less then  Fifty dollars for a share of stock  in that House & they shall be  permitted to receive Fifteen  Thousand dollars from any one  man for stock in that house  but they shall not be permitt  ed to receive over fifteen thousand  dollars stock from any one man [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:62-65##] 
 and they shall not be permitted to  receive under Fifty dollars for a  share of stock from any one man  in that house, & they shall not  be permitted to receive any man  as a stockholder in that house  except the same shall pay his stock  stock unto their hands at the time  he receives stock and in proportion  to the amount of stock he pays  into their hands he shall receive  stock in that house but if he  pay nothing into their hands  he shall not receive any stock in  that house & if any man pays stock  into their hands it shall be for  stock in that house for himself & [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:66-69##] 
 for his generation after him from  generation to generation so long  as he & his heirs shall hold that stock  & do not sell or convey that stock  away out of their hands by their  own free will and act if you  will do my will saith the Lord   your God.    And again verily  I say unto you if my servant  George Miller & my servant Lyman  Wight, & my servant John Snider,  & my servent Peter Hawes receive  any stock into their hands in  monies or in properties wherein  they receive the real value of monies  they shall not appropriate any portion  of that stock to any other purpose  ownly in that house & if they do [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:69-71##] 
 appropriate any portion of that stock  (to any other purpose ^portion^) any whare els  ownly in that house without the  consent of the stockholder & do  not repay four fold for the stock,  which they appropriate any whare  else ownly in that house they  shall be accursed & shall be moved  out of their place saith the Lord  God, for I the Lord am God &  cannot be mocked in any of  these things. Verily I say unto  you let my servent Joseph   pay stock into their hands for  the building of that house as  seemeth him good but my  Servant Joseph cannot pay over [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:71-72##] 
 fifteen thousand dollars stock in that  House nor under Fifty dollars  neither can any other man saith  the Lord. And their are others also  who wish to know my will concern-  ing them for they have asked it at  my hands. [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:72-73##] Let my Servent Isaac  Galland put stock into that house  for I the Lord loveth him for  the work he hath done & will forgive  all his sins, therefore let him be  remembered for an interest in  that house from generation to  generation. Let my Servent  Isaac Galland be appointed among  you & be ordained by my servent  William Marks & be blessed of [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:78-79##] 
 of him to go with my servent  Hyrum to accomplish the work  that my Servent Joseph shall app  point out unto them & they shall  be greatly blessed. [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:79##] Let my servent  William Law pay stock into that  House for himself & for his seed  after him from generation to gen-  eration if he will do my will  let him not take his family  into the eastern lands even unto  Kirtland nevertheless I the  Lord will build up Kirtland  but I the Lord have a scourge  prepared for the inhabitants thereof. [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:82-83##]  Let no man go from this place  who has come here assaying to  keep my commandments [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:85##] 
 if they will live here let them  live unto me, & if they die  here let them die unto me for  they shall rest from all their lab-  ours here & shall continue their work,  theirfore let my Servant William  put his trust in me & cease to  fear concerning his family  because of the sickness of the land  if ye love me keep my com  mandments & the sickness of the land  shall redound to your glory.  Let my Servant William  go & proclaim myine everlasting  Gospel with a loud voice & with  great joy as he shall be moved  upon by my Spirit unto the [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:86-88##] 
 inhabitants of Warsaw & also  unto the inhabitants of Carthage  & also unto the inhabitants of Madison  & also unto the inhabitants of Burling-  ton and await patiently & dilligently  for further instructions at my  general conference saith the Lord  If he will do my will let him  from henceforth harken to the  council of my Servant Joseph  & with his interest support the  cause of the poor & publish  the New Translation of my Holy  word unto the inhabitants of the  Earth & if he will do this I will  bless him with a multiplicity  of blessings that he shall not [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:88-90##] 
 be forsaken nor his seed be found  begging bread. And again verily  I say unto you let my servent  William be appointed ordained and  annointed as a counsellor unto  my servant Joseph in the room  of my Servant Hyrum that  my Servant Hyrum may take  the Office of priesthood & patriarch  which was appointed unto him  by his father by blessing & also  by right that from henceforth  he shall hold the keys of the Patr-  iarchal Blessings upon the heads  of all my people, that whoever  he blesses shall be blessed & whoever  he curses shall be cursed & whatsoever [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:90-93##] 
 he shall bind on the Earth shall  be bound in heaven, & that  whatsoever he shall loose on Earth  shall be loosed in Heaven &  from this time forth I appoint  unto him that he may be a  Prophet and a Seer and a Revelator    unto my Church as well as  my Servant Joseph that he may  act in concert also with my  servant Joseph & that he shall  receive council from my  servant Joseph who shall show  unto him the keys whareby he  may ask & receive & be crowned  with the same blessing. I   crown upon his head the [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:93-95##] 
 Bishopprick, and Blessing, and glory,  and honour, and priesthood, and gifts,  of the priesthood that once were put  upon him that was my servent  Oliver Cowdery, that my Servant  Hyrum may bear record of  the thing which I shall show  unto him, that his name may  be had in honorable remembrance  from generation to generation  forever & ever. Let my servent  William Law also receive the  keys by which he may ask &  receive blessings let him be  humble before me & be without  guile & he shall receve of my spirit  even the comforter which shall [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:95-97##] 
 manifest unto him the truth of  all things & shall give him in the  vary hour what he shall say &  those signs shall follow him  he shall heal the sick he shall  cast out devils & shall be  delivered from those who would  administer unto him deadly  Poison & shall be led in paths  whare the poisonous serpent cannot  lay hold upon his heel & he shall  mount up in the imagination  of his thoughts as upon eagles  wings & what if I will that he  should raise the dead— let him  not withhold his voice therefore  let my servant William cry  aloud & spare not with Joy & [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:97-101##] 
 rejoiceing with hosannahs to  him that sitteth upon the Throne  forever & ever saith the Lord your  God. Behold I say unto you  I have a mission for my servant  William & my Servant Hyrum  & for them alone, & let my  servant Joseph tarry at home  for he is needed— the remainder  I will show unto you hereafter  even so amen.    And again I say unto you   if my Servant Sidney will  serve me & be a councillor  unto my Servant Joseph let  him arise & come up & stand  in the office of his calling &  humble himself before me [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:101-103##] 
 and if he will offer unto me  an acceptable offering & acknow-  ledgments & remain with my  people behold! I the Lord your  God will heal him that he shall  be healed & shall lift up his  voice again upon the mounta  ins & be a spokesman before  my face let him come &  locate his family in the  Neighbourhood in which  my servant Joseph resides  and in all his journeyings  let him lift up his voice as  with the sound of a trump and  warn the inhabitants of the Earth  to flee the wrath to come let him [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:103-107##] 
 assist my Servent Joseph & also  let my Servant William Law assist  my Servant Joseph in making  a solemn proclamation unto  the Kings of the Earth even as I  have before said unto you. [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:107##]  And again verily I say unto  you let no man pay stock  to the quorum of the Nauvoo House  unless he shall be a believer in  the Book of Mormon & the revelat-  ions I have given unto you  saith the Lord your God for  that which is more or less [than] this  cometh of evil & shall be attend  ed with cursings & not blessings  saith the Lord your God even  so Amen. [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:119-120##] 
 Verily I now say unto you &  now give unto you the offices  belonging to my priesthood that  you may hold the keys thereof  even the priesthood which is after  the order of Melchisedek which  is after the order of my ownly  Begotten Son.    First I give  unto you Hyrum Smith to  be a patriarch unto you to  hold the Sealing Blessings of  my Church even the Holy Spirit  of promise whareby you are  sealed up unto the day of redem-  ption that ye may not fall  notwithstanding the rain of  temptation that may come [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:123-124##] 
 upon you. I give unto you  my Servant Joseph to be a presiding  Elder over all my church to be  a translater a Revelator a Seer and  Prophet. I give unto him  for councillors my servant  Sidney Rigdon & my servant  William Law & these may  constitute a quorum & First  presidency to receive the oracles  for the whole church &c, &c, &c, [##Doctrine and Covenants 124:124-126##]  [rest of page blank]
